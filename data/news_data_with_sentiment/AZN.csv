2014-04-28,AZN,Sounds like Pfizer needs to sharpen its pencil,"AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN)Â BOD respondsÂ to Pfizer's press release about its offer to buy the former for $76.62/share.
According to AZN, Pfizer (PFE) chief Ian Read first contacted Chairman Leif Johansson on November 25, 2103 about a potential combination. Mr. Johansson expressed confidence in his firm's prospects but agreed to meet his counterpart in New York on January 5, 2014. At this meeting Pfizer made a preliminary offer for AZN ofÂ Â£13.98 in cash plus 1.758 shares of PFE stock representing a value ofÂ Â£46.61 ($76.61) per AZN share based on PFE's closing price of $30.52 on January 3. PFE's proposal also included a new U.S. listed and headquartered holding company.
AZN's BOD felt that the proposal significantly undervalued AZN and its prospects. It was also concerned that 70% of the deal was PFE stock. Still another problem was the intended inversion structure where PFE would redomicile to the U.K. for tax purposes.
On January 12 AZN wrote to PFE rejecting its offer. PFE responded on January 15 that it was no longer actively considering an offer for AZN.
The AZN BOD reaffirms its commitment to its strategy announced in March 2013.
In the meantime, PFE contacted the U.K. government about the merits of the deal.
On April 26 Mr. Read contacted Mr. Johansson requesting they make a joint statement stating they were entering discussions about a combination despite the absence of a new offer. The AZN BOD declined to do so without first seeing a new proposal.

Only an EGFR mutation-positive patient is eligible to receive Iressa, which is determined by analyzing a tumor biopsy sample. In ~25% of the cases, however, an evaluable biopsy sample cannot be obtained.
Iressa is the first EGFR TKI with a label allowing the analysis of circulating tumor DNA to be used to assess EGFR status in patients where a biopsy sample is not an option.",0.040090929716825485,0.9295560717582703,0.030353005975484848
2014-10-06,AZN,Perosphere and Daiichi Sankyo ink third collaboration agreement on anticoagulant reversal drug,"Privately-held Danbury, CT-based Perosphere enters into a third collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to study PER977, Perosphere's investigational anticoagulant reversal agent, in Phase 3 trials with edoxaban, Daiichi's investigational oral, once-daily factor Xa-inhibitor.
In Phase 1 and 2 studies, PER977 showed that it directly binds to heparin as well as circulating direct factor Xa- and IIa-inhibitors reversing their anticoagulant effect. PER977 does not bind to blood coagulation factors or other blood proteins. In healthy volunteers, it reverses anticoagulant activity after a single IV dose of 100 mg - 300 mg and does not require an extended infusion in order to maintain the reversal.
Under the terms of the agreement, Perosphere will seek FDA and EMA approval of PER977 to reverse anticoagulant activity of edoxaban and commercialize PER977 in the U.S. and EU. It retains full worldwide commercial rights to PER977. Perosphere will receive an upfront payment from Daiichi Sankyo as well as clinical development-related milestones. It plans to submit an NDA to the FDA by June 2015.

2014-10-10,AZN,Texas takes exception to AstraZeneca's marketing of antipsychotic,"The Texas Attorney General files a lawsuit in state court accusing AstraZeneca (AZN
+2.9%) of illegally marketing its antipsychotic Seroquel (quetiapine fumarate) for unapproved uses and paying kickbacks to physicians and state health officials. The Texas AG's action builds on whistleblower suits that have been filed by two former AZN sales reps.
The company allegedly paid $465K to a pair of unidentified state mental health officials who had the power to influence the formulary decisions with the state hospital system. People with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are frequently uninsured so they rely on state programs for medication.
The lawsuit repeats allegations by former sales rep Tracy Miksell-Branch that the firm established quotas to force them to market the drug for unapproved uses.
AZN settled a Justice Department suit in 2010 regarding its marketing of Seroquel for $520M.
The Texas AG has experience going after corporate misbehavior. It sued J &J's Janssen unit over alleged illegal marketing of its antipsychotic Risperdal (risperidone). The company settled the case two years ago by paying $181M.",0.3325231075286865,0.6423495411872864,0.025127315893769264
2014-10-13,AZN,Jeffries' rationale for AstraZeneca upgrade relies on less-than-desirable behavior by management,"As any serious student of the market knows, sell-side analysts have a credibility problem. As a group, they typically bestow a bullish rating on 90%+ of covered firms with seemingly total disregard for overvaluations or negative developments or bearish price behavior. This is particularly true of cases where the investment bank has underwritten a public offering. Anything short of an atomic blast at headquarters will be ineffectual in changing their rosy forecast.
Today, Jefferies takes a bit of a different tack. It upgrades AstraZeneca (AZN
+2%) to ""Buy"" based on the expectation that management's greed in preserving its bonuses will motivate the team to do whatever is necessary to prop up earnings. Apparently, its bonus plan specifies that the company's dividend must be 1.5 times covered which implies a floor EPS of $4.20. Earnings will come under pressure for the next three years due to patent expirations and the timing of regulatory approvals for pipeline products so executives will have to cut costs or make acquisitions to deliver enough earnings for them to receive their payouts.
To demonstrate his/her confidence that management has a keen eye on the bonuses, the analyst's EPS forecast is 10% above consensus for 2015 - 2017. AZN executives would probably describe the situation differently considering the expectation that they employ a long-term view and act in shareholders' best interest.",0.045572273433208466,0.9031834602355957,0.051244284957647324

The three highest doses of dupilumab in combination with standard-of-care therapy met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant improvement from baseline in forced expiratory volume over one second (FEV1) at week 12 in patients with high blood eosinophils (>= 300 cells/microliter) compared to placebo in combination with standard-of-care therapy. Also, two doses of dupilumab (200 mg every other week and 300 mg every other week) showed a statistically significant improvement in mean percent change in FEV1 and a reduction in severe exacerbations, both in the high eosinophils group and the overall study population.
Dupilumab blocks IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines required by the Th2 immune response.

2014-11-25,AZN,Drug makers face pushback on pricey meds,"Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) is at the forefront of an increasing wave of resistance to the high prices of new drugs from pharma and biotech firms, some which cost as much as $50K per month. Pharmaceutical spending in the U.S. is $270B and may breach $500B in five years. ESRX's method of controlling costs is to refuse to pay for them. For 2015, for example, it is excluding 66 branded drugs from its main formulary, an increase of 18 from 2014's 48. On the list is Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) rheumatoid arthritis drugÂ Simponi (golimumab) which costs $3K per month.
Other prescription benefits managers are employing similar tactics. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) will exclude 95 drugs from its 2015 formulary including Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) multiple sclerosis med Rebif (interferon beta-1a) which costs $5K for a four-week supply.
Governments are pushing back as well. Among 42 state Medicaid programs, 27 pay for Gilead Sciences' HCV medÂ Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) only for patients with severe liver damage while others impose coverage limitations for patients with recent substance-abuse problems. In the U.S., the full regimen cost is $84K. Recently, Britain's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) balked at recommending reimbursement for Roche's (OTCQX:RHHBY) blood cancer drug Gazyvaro (obinutuzumab).
Ninety percent of commercial health plans require pre-approval of specialty drugs, up from 82% in 2011.

2014-12-03,AZN,AstraZeneca could face hefty damages in Nexium case,"AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) could be on the hook for substantial damages if it loses a trial in Boston involving Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (OTC:RBXLY) (OTC:RBXZF) and their pay-to-delay agreement that blocked generic competition to Nexium. This is first such trial since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that companies can be sued over these deals if the payments are large and unjustified.
The suit challenges a 2008 settlement of a patent dispute between the two companies that postponed the entry of generic competition until this year. Plaintiffs argue that the $1B+ that Ranbaxy received violated antitrust law and was excessive for a patent case.
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) was also a defendant in the case but it reached a settlement with the plaintiffs after four weeks of testimony.
If the plaintiffs win, there will be another trial to determine the amount of damages. A win, though, is far from certain because the drug buyers have failed to show that they were harmed by the deal. Two weeks into the trial, AstraZeneca filed a motion to throw out the claims on the basis that the plaintiffs' experts failed to offer evidence of what they regard as proper royalty rates for drugs, a stipulation made by the court for the trial to proceed. Judge William Young denied the motion without elaborating.

2015-02-19,AZN,Makers of pricey drugs working on new payment model,"Facing ever-increasing pushback from payers over the high price of new treatments, some biotech firms are working on a new payment model that rewards them for the long-term performance of their drugs. Gene therapy developers, including BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN
+0.4%) and Sangamo BioSciences (SGMO
-0.1%), are leading the effort.
The industry says that a one-time cure, even if priced greater than $1M, saves money over the long term but acknowledges that payers will balk at paying the cost upfront. The general consensus is that an upfront payment over $1M will be unacceptable.
Under a pay-for-performance scheme, the annuity-like payments would cease if medical testing showed that the therapy was not working. Much work remains to be done, though, before this approach could be implemented. For example, legislation may be required to force insurers to pick up the tab for patients that switch coverage.
Some proponents of the new scheme say that the payment streams could be securitized and sold to investors, like consumer debt.
Gene therapies represent the highest priced treatments. Only one has cleared the regulatory hurdle to date, UniQure's (QURE
+1.5%) Glybera, which costs 850K euros ($1M) in Germany. It will be sold for a one-time payment because it is too difficult to measure how well it works (this reasoning will undoubtedly pop up again).

Both doses of Brilinta used in the study significantly reduced CV death, myocardial infarction (heart attack) or stroke compared to placebo. The rate at three years for the ticagrelor 90 mg arm was 7.85%; 7.77% for ticagrelor 60 mg and 9.04% for placebo (p=0.0043). Â A numerical decrease in the secondary endpoints of CV death and all-cause mortality was observed, but did not reach statistical significance.
As expected with an oral antiplatelet, TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) bleeding was higher in the ticagrelor arms than placebo. TIMI major bleeding rates were: 2.60% for ticagrelor 90 mg; 2.30% for ticagrelor 60 mg and 1.06% for placebo (p<0.001).
The study, called PEGASUS-TIMI 54, involved over 21,000 patients worldwide. It is the first prospective trial to evaluate longer term antiplatelet therapy in higher risk patients with a history of heart attack.

PT003 is a twice-daily fixed-dose combination of glycopyrronium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and formoterol fumarate, a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA). It is the first LAMA/LABA combination to be delivered in a pressurized metered dose inhaler using the porous particle co-suspension technology developed by Pearl Therapeutics, which AZN acquired in 2013. The successful outcomes of the PINNACLE studies are the first from a series of pipeline candidates using Pearl's technology.
PT003 was assessed in over 3,700 patients in over 275 study sites. The primary efficacy endpoint was trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). PT003 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in FEV1 versus placebo and the individual components glycopyrronium (PT001) and formoterol fumarate (PT005). PT001 and PT005 also showed statistically significant improvements in FEV1 compared to placebo.
The company plans to file regulatory applications beginning this year. It will present the study results at a scientific meeting later this year.

2015-03-19,AZN,AstraZeneca inks U.S. co-commercialization deal for OIC med,"AstraZeneca (AZN
-0.2%) and Daiichi Sankyo (OTCPK:DSKYF) (OTCPK:DSNKY) pair up to commercialize the former's Movantik (naloxegol) in the U.S. for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. Under the terms of the agreement, Daiichi will pay an upfront fee of $200M and subsequent sales-related payments of up to $625M. AstraZeneca will be responsible for manufacturing, will book all sales and will make sales-related commission payments to Daiichi. Both firms will sell the product. There is no change in AZN's previously announced financial guidance. The deal is emblematic of AZN's evolving business model to drive value through externalization activity. The launch in the U.S. is planned for early April.
AZN licensed naloxegol from Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR
-4.2%) in 2009.Â It was approved by the FDA in September.Â The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) removed it from its Schedule II list in January citing its lack of abuse and dependence potential.
Opioids relieve pain by binding to mu-receptors in the central nervous system. Unfortunately, they can also bind to mu-receptors in the bowel which results in OIC. The incidence of OIC in patients taking prescription opioid medicines for chronic pain is believed to be as high as 81%.

2015-03-20,AZN,AstraZeneca may again become a takeover target if growth fails to materialize,"According to Bloomberg, AstraZeneca's (AZN
+2.6%) previously stated plan to increase revenue 75% by 2023 is looking a bit wobbly. In cancer, for example, it trails three competitors in immunotherapies for lung cancer. The FDA approved Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY
+0.2%) Opdivo for the indication on March 4. AZN's candidate, MEDI4736, is still in clinical development with an NDA filing on tap for next year. Being late to the party means modest sales unless there is a profound advantage, something that MEDI4736 may not have unless combined with other drugs.
If the company's sales growth fails to ramp, its valuation could slump and encourage another takeover bid. AZN currently sports a P/E of 79 versus the industry average of 25 (per msn money).
Last year, CEO Pascal Soriot fought off a $117B bid from Pfizer (PFE
+0.2%) telling investors that the firm could increase revenues to $45B by 2023. The company remains bullish, though. Spokesperson Esra Erkal-Paler says that the firm is making significant progress and that oncology drugs could represent 25% of sales by 2023, up from 12% in 2014. It is currently running clinical studies of AZD9291, a non-immune therapy, in lung cancer patients with a specific mutation who have relapsed after prior treatment. If it can beat rival Clovis Oncology (CLVS
-2.4%) to the market, it could be worth as much as $3B per year.
Mirabaud analyst Nick Turner says that even if all the drugs in the pipeline make it to the market, AZN will have to stretch to reach $45B in 2023 because two of its biggest sellers, Crestor (ttm sales=$5.5B) and Nexium (ttm sales=$3.7B), face declining sales from the loss of patent protection.",0.040517088025808334,0.9011425375938416,0.058340318500995636
2015-03-31,AZN,Cancer PD-1 inhibitor market only half as large as consensus says analyst,"Former Nomura analyst Amit Roy says the market for cancer immunotherapies called PD-1 inhibitors will only be ~$10B, far below the $20B - 30B forecasts being circulated today. He cites two main factors that could hamper growth: they only work for certain groups of cancer patients plus several layers of selection will be required for some cancers such as breast and colorectal, and there is a growing evidence that shorter therapy, cutting the treatment period to eight from 16 weeks, may be sufficient. If this comes to fruition, it would shrink the market by almost half (although a price increase could mitigate some of the shrinkage).

PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) is found on the surface of cancer cells. It is used by tumors to evade the immune system so blocking its action enables the body to attack and kill cancer.

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, called SAVOR, involved 16,492 high-CV risk patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoint was the CV safety of saxagliptin as measured by the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). A MACE event was defined as CV death, non-fatal cardiac infarction (heart attack) or non-fatal ischemic stroke.Â The objective was to demonstrate saxagliptin's non-inferiority (no worse than) to placebo in its effect on CV risk.
According to AstraZeneca'sÂ briefing document,Â SAVOR was successful in demonstrating saxagliptin's non-inferiority to placebo. There was also no statistical difference in the broader endpoint of the incidences of MACE and hospitalizations for unstable angina, heart failure or coronary revascularization between the groups.
There was a higher incidence of all-cause mortality in the saxagliptin cohort, although it could not attributed to the drug. The study did show higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in patients at increased risk for HF (those with a history of HF or renal impairment).

The initial plan includes Phase 2 studies of the combination in solid tumors, multiple Phase 2s involving IPH2201 as monotherapy and in combination with currently approved treatments across a range of cancers and the development of associated biomarkers.
Under the terms of the agreement, Innate will receive an initial payment of $250M, $100M prior to the initiation of Phase 3 development, regulatory- and sales-based milestones and double digit royalties. Innate has the right to co-promote in Europe for a 50% profit share. AstraZeneca will have exclusive global rights to commercialize IPH2201 in combination with MEDI4736 as well as access to IPH2201 in monotherapy and other combinations in certain treatment areas.

IPH2201 is a humanized IgG4 antibody, an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic NK (natural killer) and CD8 T lymphocytes. Blocking the inhibitory function of CD94/NKG2A enhances the ability of NK and T cells to kill cancer cells.
MEDI4736 is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1, a protein found on the surface of cancer cells that allows them to avoid detection by the immune system. Binding to PD-L1 enables T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells.",0.03771165385842323,0.9255846738815308,0.03670366480946541

2015-05-07,AZN,FDA to hold public meeting on off-label drug promotion,"Spurred by the progress of a bill moving through Congress that will speed new drugs to market for conditions lacking cures, called The 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has scheduled a public meeting this summer to address concerns by the drugs industry that regulatory restrictions on what they can say about the off-label use of their products violates their First Amendment right to free speech. Language in the bill is ratcheting up the pressure on the agency to relax its guidelines.
Drug makers were emboldened on its prospects of changing the rules after an appeals court overturned the conviction of a pharmaceutical sales representative in 2012 who was convicted of promoting off-label uses of the narcolepsy drug Xyrem. The court ruling was based on First Amendment protection for truthful and non-misleading off-label speech.
The American Medical Association supports the need for physicians to have access to accurate and unbiased information about off-label uses of drugs since it already accounts for as much as 20% of prescribing, with higher levels in oncology and pediatric rare diseases.
Giving drug firms more leeway in this arena has its detractors, however. Rita Redberg, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the UC-San Francisco says, ""At my own medical center we have banned pharmaceutical reps from coming because we don't think they are a good source of information. You don't ask the barber if you need a haircut.""
Pharma companies have a dubious history of breaking the rules governing off-label promotion. Over the past 10 years, 17 firms have paid more than $16B in settlements related to inappropriate off-label selling.
Further complicating matters is the fact that up to 75% of published pre-clinical trial results cannot be reproduced in later studies.

2015-05-15,AZN,FDA warns on potential side effect of new diabetes drugs,"The FDA issues a warning that type 2 diabetic patients taking drugs called sodium-glucose contransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors to lower their blood sugar may have increased risk of developing ketoacidosis, a serious condition characterized by the buildup of acids, called ketones, in the blood that can be life-threatening if untreated for an extended period. It is caused by an insulin deficiency which forces cells to burn fat for energy instead of glucose which produces ketones.
The agency is investigating the issue to determine if the safety risk warrants changes to the labeling of currently approved medications. There were 20 reported cases of ketoacidosis in the period from March 2013 to June 6, 2014, all of which required emergency room visits or hospitalization.

This isn't too surprising since oncology represents only 11% of AZN's business. CAR-Ts are all the rage in the cancer space. If their initial success can be validated in late-stage trials, they will command premium prices once approved, probably in the neighborhood of $500K per procedure. Acquiring one of the leaders would be a logical move for most members of Big Pharma or a number of larger biotechs. Juno's market cap is only $5.5B so it is not expensive if viewed on a long term basis.

2015-08-13,AZN,Data from mid-stage study show CKD patients with anemia respond to FibroGen's roxadustat in dose-related manner,"Data from a Phase 2a clinical trial assessing FibroGen's (NASDAQ:FGEN) lead product candidate, roxadustat, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated anemia show responder rates that increase in a dose-dependent way. The results were published in Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation.
The study enrolled 116 subjects with CKD-associated anemia who were not undergoing dialysis. Of this group, 96 were evaluable for efficacy. Four doses of roxadustat were tested (0.7, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg) compared to placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between the test arms and control arm. The responder rates (increased hemoglobin levels) ranged from 30% in the 0.7 mg/kg arm to 100% in the 2.0 mg/kg arm. The median time to response ranged from 42 days (1 mg/kg) to 14 days (2 mg/kg).

The two-part open label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of axalimogene filolisbac as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab in ~66 subjects. Phase 1 will establish the maximum tolerated dose while Phase 2 will randomize patients to receive axalimogene filolisbac as monotherapy, durvalumab as monotherapy or the combination. The primary endpoints include objective response rate and progression-free survival. The estimated study completion date is December 2019.
Axalimogene filolisbac is an immunotherapy based on the Advaxis Lm Technology, which uses live attenuated bioengineered Listeria bacteria to deliver a fusion protein inside cancer cells which then stimulates the immune system to attack the cancer.
Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 (programmed death- ligand 1), a transmembrane protein on cancer cells. PD-L1 suppresses the immune system by binding to the PD-1 receptor found on the surface of activated immune cells. Binding to PD-1 down-regulates the immune system by preventing the activation of T cells.",0.052804749459028244,0.9158800840377808,0.03131520003080368

The data were presented at the American College of Rheumatology 2015 Scientific Meeting in San Francisco.
The study met its primary endpoint of showing a statistically significant difference in the percentage of responders compared to placebo as measured by the SLS Responder Index 4 (SRI4) at day 169, along with a sustained reduction of oral corticosteroid (OCS)Â use between day 85 and 169. 34.4% of patients receiving anifrolumab 300 mg IV for four weeks achieved a response while 28.8% who received anifrolumab 1,000 mg IV for four weeks responded. Both handily beat placebo's response rate of 17.6%.
The trial met the secondary endpoint of a statistically significant difference in responders measured by SRI4 at day 365. The proportions for the 300 mg, 1000 mg and placebo arms were 51.5%, 38.5% and 25.5%, respectively. Another secondary endpoint, a sustained reduction in OCS use, was also met. In those patients taking at least 10mg/day of OCS at baseline, their use fell to no more than 7.5 mg/day by day 365.
Adverse events were similar across the groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 18.8% of the placebo cohort compared to 16.7% in the pooled anifrolumab groups. A dose-dependent increase in Herpes zoster was observed (placebo: 2.0%; 300 mg: 5.1%; 1000 mg: 9.5%) as was the incidence of influenza infections, although most were unconfirmed (placebo: 2.0%; 300 mg: 6.1%; 1000 mg: 7.6%).

The 1,800-subject, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted across 200 centers worldwide. The study population will include NASH patients who have a NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) of at least 4, with F2 (light) or F3 (severe) fibrosis. Participants will receive 120 mg of Elafibranor or placebo once daily. An interim analysis will be performed on the first 900 patients after 72 weeks that will support initial regulatory approval. To support full approval, the trial will continue to conclusion to show the impact of Elafibranor on the prevention of cirrhosis and other liver-related outcomes on the full study population. A group of F1 fibrotic patients who have cardiometabolic co-morbidities will be enrolled as well. The study will continue post-marketing and will remain blinded after the interim analysis. All patients will be followed until the occurrence of a pre-defined number of progressions to cirrhosis or other liver-related events.
The primary endpoint is the resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis.

-5.1%) monoclonal antibodies, durvalumab and tremelimumab, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) irrespective of PD-L1 status, showed encouraging antitumor activity. The data were published in The Lancet Oncology.
In a cohort of 26 subjects treated with the combination and followed for ~24 weeks, the overall objective response rate (ORR) was 23%. The ORR in PD-L1-positive patients was 22% and 29% in PD-L1-negative patients.
PD-L1-negative NSCLC patients represent a significant unmet medical need. Some leading monoclonals, such as Merck's KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), are targeted specifically to PD-L1-positives, less than half of cases.
Durvalumab is a PD-L1 inhibitor and tremelimumab is a CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4) inhibitor.Â Preclinical data suggest an additive or synergistic effect from targeting both.
Treatment with the antibodies was no walk in the park, though. 30% experienced Grade 3 (severe) or Grade 4 (disabling or life-threatening) adverse events while 16% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

The new guideline on the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy was recently issued by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association.
The data supporting the change was generated in the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 study. The new approach supports the continuation of antiplatelet therapy beyond 12 months in prior heart attack patients who are not at high bleeding risk.
The FDA approved Brilinta at a 60 mg dose in September 2015 in patients with a history of heart attack. It is indicated to reduce the rate of CV death, heart attack and stroke in patients with ACS or a history of heart attack. AstraZeneca expects it to generate peak sales of $3.5B.

There appears to be a growing lack of confidence that the company's Breakthrough Therapy-tagged lung cancer candidate, rociletinib, will get a ""thumbs up"" at next week's Ad Comm meeting (Tuesday, April 12). The noise continues to build that the company has been less than forthright with the data from the Phase 3 study so there will be substantial scrutiny on the briefing docs that will be released no later (hopefully) than Friday, April 8.
Shares plummeted last November when the company announced that the FDA requested additional efficacy data on both the 500 mg and 625 mg dosage groups. It also disclosed that the confirmed response rates were about 20 percentage points lower than expected (28% for 500 mg and 34% for 625 mg). So low, in fact, that its effectiveness appears to be well below rival AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN) Tagrisso (osimertinib), which showed an overall response rate of 59% in clinical studies.

+8%) is worth $55 a share, ~5% above Sanofi's (SNY
-1.1%) unsolicited bid of $52.50. It says much of the attention has focused on the prospects of prostate cancer drug XTANDI (enzalutamide), approved by the FDA in August 2012, which generated $1.15B in the U.S. last year as reported by development and commercialization partner Astellas Pharma (OTCPK:ALPMF)(OTCPK:ALPMY). What appears to be underrepresented is the value of the company's pipeline, led by late-stage PARP inhibitor talazoparib.
According to the analyst, other potential bidders include AstraZeneca (AZN
-0.5%), Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY
-0.5%) and Celgene (CELG
+0.9%).
AstraZeneca reportedly has held internal talks about an offer. Medivation rejected Sanofi's first approach several weeks ago, so the bidding could turn hostile if the board rejects $52.50, a likely scenario.
Citi says Sanofi's offer is a bit light considering MDVN's 52-week high of $66.39, hit in June of last year. The board might reject the offer based purely on technical grounds.

The double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study randomized 1,810 subjects to receive either Glaxo's fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) or budesonide/formoterol. The co-primary endpoints were a measure of lung function called trough FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) and quality of life as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at week 24. Patients in the FF/UMEC/VI cohort experienced a statistically significantly greater increase in FEV1 while half achieved the minimum clinically important difference in SGRQ of -4 units (compared to 41% for budesonide/formoterol).
At week 24, the incidence of investigator-reported serious adverse events for FF/UMEC/VI and budesonide/formoterol were 5.4% and 5.7%, respectively, including worsening of COPD (1.3%, 2.3%), pneumonia (1.0%, 0.3%) and cardiac disorders (0.3%, 1.0%).

Under the terms of the agreement, LEO Pharma will make an upfront payment to AstraZeneca of $115M for the exclusive, global rights to tralokinumab for skin diseases. It will also pay AstraZeneca up to $1B in commercially-related milestones and royalties on product sales.
AstraZeneca reacquired the European rights to brodalumab from Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), who will continue to lead development and commercialization in the U.S. and other markets not covered by Kyowa Hakko Kirin (Japan and certain other Asian countries).

The data were presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in London. Detailed results were published today in The Lancet.
A total of 2,511 patients (1,205 in SIROCCO and 1,306 in CALIMA) who were receiving standard-of-care therapy, including inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta 2 agonists, were randomized to receive either 30 mg of benralizumab every four weeks; 30 mg of benralizumab every four weeks three times followed by 30 mg every eight weeks; or placebo for 48 weeks.
The eight-week benralizumab regimen showed a reduction in the annual rate of asthma exacerbations of up to 51% and an improvement in lung function (measured by FEV1 of up to 159 mL) after four weeks of therapy that was sustained throughout the treatment period.

The data were presented today at the 52nd Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Munich, Germany.
The study met its primary endpoint of significantly reducing HbA1c levels from baseline with the combination compared to standard-of-care therapy with the individual drugs. The specific reductions in HbA1c in patients receiving the combination, exenatide alone once/week and dapagliflozin alone once/day were -2.0%, -1.6% and -1.4%, respectively; p<0.01.
Patients treated with the combination also experienced statistically significantly greater weight loss and reduction in systolic blood pressure than those receiving standard of care therapy.

The aim of the study was to determine if there was a treatment benefit (significantly improved prevention of clotting events) from ticagrelor over clopidogrel as measured by the difference in the time of first occurrence of any event in the composite. Participants received either Brilinta 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg once daily.
Full results will be presented next month at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in New Orleans, LA.
In March, the Brilinta failed to beat aspirin in a large-scale study, SOCRATES, in preventing major vascular events (stroke, MI, death) in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.
Brilinta is the #3 seller in AstraZeneca's Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease unit, generating $739M in sales over the most recent four quarters (#1 is Crestor with $4,622M and #2 is Onglyza with $797M).

-3.6%) heads south on triple normal volume on the heels of its announcement that the FDA has placed a partial clinical hold on its clinical trials assessing durvalumab in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
The partial clinical hold, which suspends recruitment, was instituted so an analysis can be made on adverse events related to bleeding. The effort is part of routine safety monitoring of the Phase 3 KESTREL and EAGLE studies.
Bleeding is a common complication in therapies to treat HNSCC due to the nature of the disease, the proximity of tumors to major blood vessels and prior treatments such as surgery and radiation.
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) which is expressed by some tumors to evade detection by the immune system by binding to PD-1 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 enhances the immune system's ability to detect and kill cancer cells.",0.04049038514494896,0.9322545528411865,0.027255071327090263

2016-11-10,AZN,Accelerated Pharma on deck for IPO,"Westport, CT-based Accelerated Pharma (ACCP) is set for its IPO of 1,888,889 shares of common stock at $8 - 10.
The clinical stage biopharmaceutical firm employs its genomic technology to enhance the development of pre-existing pharmaceutical products for the treatment of a range of cancers and to prospectively identify patients who may be the best responders to therapy.
Its lead product candidate is Picoplatin, a next-generation platinum-based chemotherapeutic. Its value proposition is less unwanted side effects and improved ability to overcome platinum resistance. Phase 2 studies in colorectal cancer and squamous head and neck cancer should commence this month.
Picoplatin was originally developed by a subsidiary of AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN). It was then sold to Genzyme (NASDAQ:SNY) who licensed it to Poniard Pharmaceuticals. In early November 2009, Poniard announced that a Phase 3 study in small cell lung cancer failed to achieve its primary efficacy endpoint and stopped development. In 2013, Encarta (predecessor to Tallikut Pharmaceuticals) acquired certain assets from Poniard including the Genzyme license. Accelerated Pharma obtained the rights via an exclusive license with Tallikut in June 2014.

The data were presented at the 17th World Conference on Lung Cancer in Vienna, Austria.
AURA3 showed that treatment with TAGRISSO produced a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with a 70% reduction in the risk of death (10.1 months vs. 4.4 months; p<0.001; hazard ratio = 0.30).
In a pre-specified exploratory subgroup analysis, 34% of patients with central nervous system metastases, PFS in the TAGRISSO group was 8.5 months versus 4.2 with platinum-pemetrexed chemo (hazard ratio = 0.32).
The safety profile of TAGRISSO was similar to earlier studies. Grade 3 (severe) or higher treatment-related adverse events were observed in 6% (n=16) of the TAGRISSO cohort compared to 34% (n=46) in the chemo cohort.

+2.2%) is getting longer as more analysts are extolling the market opportunity of cancer med KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) combined with chemotherapy. The company's U.S. marketing application for the treatment of lung cancer could be approved in May, to the detriment of competitors Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY), AstraZeneca (AZN
+0.1%) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY
-0.1%).
Morgan Stanley's David Risinger has upgraded the stock to Overweight and boosted the fair value target to $71 (13% upside) from $65 citing the expanded market the combo can access (85% of first-line lung cancer cases) compared to KEYTRUDA alone (~20%). He has raised his KEYTRUDA sales estimate to $10.6B in 2020 from $7.3B.
Guggenheim's Tony Butler has also upgraded Merck to Buy with a $70 (11% upside) price target. He says KEYTRUDA sales could hit almost $3.7B this year if the combo is approved on time compared to his current $3.1B estimate. 2018 could be even better at almost $5.3B (versus ~$4.8 now).
Piper's Richard Purkiss joins in with an Overweight rating and $72 (14% upside) price target based on Merck's first-to-file position.

2017-01-17,AZN,AstraZeneca refines endpoints in late-stage lung cancer studies of durvalumab and tremelimumab; shares up 2% premarket,"AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) has tweaked the endpoints of its Phase 3 clinical trial, MYSTIC, assessing durvalumab and tremelimumab for first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The original objective was the effect on progression-free survival (PFS) but overall survival (OS) has been added, both for the combination and durvalumab monotherapy. The company says PFS data should be available by mid-year and final OS data no later than 2018.
The ongoing Phase 3 NEPTUNE study will be expanded with local patients to support a regulatory submission in China for the combination in first-line NSCLC.
A new Phase 3, PEARL, has been initiated that will assess durvalumab monotherapy versus standard-of-care chemo in first-line NSCLC patients whose tumors express PD-L1. It will focus on Asian patients, primarily Chinese, due to the high prevalence of NSCLC in the region.
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) which is expressed by some tumors to evade detection by the immune system by binding to PD-1 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 enhances the immune system's ability to detect and kill cancer cells.
Tremelimumab is a selective human antibody that binds to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), thereby ""releasing the brakes"" on T cell activation and boosting the immune system's ability to kill cancer cells.

2017-02-06,AZN,"Shore sees ""little reason"" to own AstraZeneca past ex-d date, cites disappointment risk with outcome of late-stage study of durvalumab in lung cancer","In a research note, Shore Capital says after AstraZeneca's (AZN
-0.1%) 2016 update on February 2, it is ""increasingly cautious"" ahead of the release of top-line data from the Phase 3 MYSTIC study assessing the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), expected mid-year.
Shore says the company's comments and recent addition of overall survival (OS)Â as a primary endpoint have shaken its confidence that the combo will deliver a significant clinical benefit over durvalumab alone. It adds that the company's change in language to ""PD-L1-expressing tumors"" suggest lowered confidence in the use of the combo in PD-L1-negative patients, a much larger commercial opportunity.
AstraZeneca's increasing emphasis on OS as an efficacy endpoint implies that the progression-free survival (PFS) results may not keep up with Merck's (MRK
+0.4%) Keytruda (pembrolizumab) (50% increase in PFS). OS data will not be available until 2018.
Shore adds that if durvalumab monotherapy falls short of Keytruda in PFS, then the market opportunity will be limited considering Keytruda's lead. What is there will be significantly smaller than the available market for the combo in low PD-L1 expressors.

CVD-REAL assessed data from more than 300K T2D patients across six countries, 87% had no history of cardiovascular disease. The data showed that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors [AstraZeneca's Farxiga (dapagliflozin); Janssen's Invokana (canagliflozin); Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance (empagliflozin)] reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (hazard ratio = 0.61; p<0.001) and death from any cause by 51% (hazard ratio = 0.49; p<0.001).
For the composite endpoint of hospitalization for heart failure and all-cause mortality, the reduction in risk was 46% (hazard ratio = 0.54; p<0.001).
The study data were obtained from medical records, claims databases and national registers and were not independently adjudicated/verified against source documents.
Bruce Cooper, MD, Vice President and Head of Global Medical Affairs at AstraZeneca, says, âDiabetes is a growing epidemic worldwide, which is associated with significant comorbidities that contribute to an increased risk of costly hospitalizations and even death.

Analyst Eun Yang says the poll of 29 oncologists revealed that other PARPs are ""more similar"" that previously assumed, undermining the Street's view that niraparib is the top dog. 10 of the 29 physicians viewed niraparib as the most effective while eight viewed the drugs as similar. Other PARP inhibitors are AstraZeneca's (AZNÂ +1.6%) olaparib (Lynparza)Â and Clovis Oncology's (CLVSÂ -3%) rucaparib (Rubraca). AbbVie (ABBV
+0.7%) and Pfizer (PFE
+0.6%) are working on candidates as well.
Yang's poll also suggests that a broad label ""may not translate into a big advantage."" In maintenance therapy in BRCA-positive ovarian cancer (the largest expected opportunity), 30% of respondents favored olaparib, 25% niraparib and 20% rucaparib.
She adds that potential Clovis suitors will probably wait for further data and more insignt into AZN's recent data before making a move. She believes TSRO is already exchanging hands near the takeout price so there is significant downside risk for longs.

-1.6%) was downÂ 2%Â earlier in the session on the heels of a downgrade to Neutral by UBS. Analyst Jack Scannell says the risk/reward from its Phase 3 MYSTIC study assessing durvalumab in non-small lung cancer has changed from positive to ""balanced"" saying that overall survival data will not be available until 2018 and progression-free survival (PFS) results mid-year. He believes positive PFS data will not make the product a clear winner, but weak data could brand it a loser.
He adds that the company is generating higher revenues by selling assets and making deals in order to support greater investment in its pipeline and new drugs.

-10.6%) victory lap for the U.S. launch of PARP inhibitor Zejula (niraparib) has turned into a stumble out of the gate. Shares are down on more than a 75% spike in volume over investors' apparent trepidation with the price.
Yesterday, the company announced that Zejula's wholesales acquisition cost (WAC) will be $9,833/month or ~$118K/year, based on 200 mg/day. The recommended dose, per the package insert, is 300 mg/day, however, increasing the annual cost to ~$177,000 ($14,749.50/month). The bullish price is higher than Clovis Oncology's (CLVS

+0.7%) Lynparza (olaparib) at $134,400 ($11,200/mo.).
TESARO chief Lonnie Moulder says the reason that the WAC was quoted at the 200 mg/day level is that most patients (69%) are down-dosed over the initial one-to-three months of treatment as the oncologist ""dials in"" the dose (31% remain at 300 mg/day).",0.039040353149175644,0.919577419757843,0.04138216748833656

2017-04-26,AZN,Data readout on AstraZeneca's late-stage lung cancer study of durvalumab extended to November,"Top-line results from AstraZeneca's (AZN
+0.1%) Phase 3 clinical trial, ARCTIC, assessing durvalumab (MEDI4736) in patients with advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are now expected in mid-November instead of late Q2. A spokesperson says the delay is due to the number of observed clinical events not yet reaching the protocol target.

ARCTIC is evaluating durvalumab as monotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab in NSCLC patients who have received at least two prior lines of platinum-based chemo.
Durvalumab is a PD-L1 inhibitor and tremelimumab is CTLA-4 inhibitor. Almost three months ago, the company terminated late-stage development of the combo in metastatic pancreatic ductal carcinoma.

Dr. Gottlieb also calls for a simpler approach reviewing applications for complex drugs.

2017-06-21,AZN,FDA aims at removing barriers to generic drug competition,"In a statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. says the agency should do more to restrain high drug prices by facilitating more competition via approving lower-cost generic meds.
A public meeting is scheduled for July 18 to solicit input on areas the FDA should focus on to make it more straightforward for generic drug sponsors to get their products approved. Dr. Gottlieb's Drug Competition Action Plan will target agency rules, including standards and procedures, that may create obstacles to patient access to generics.
He cites examples of branded drug makers' behavior that impede the progress and encroachment of generic competition. For instance, they make it difficult for generic drug firms to acquire the amount of branded product needed for comparative testing.
Dr. Gottlieb adds that the FDA will explore ways to coordinate with the Federal Trade Commission in identifying and publicizing practices that the FTC deems anticompetitive.

But they seem to be ignoring the very lucrative markets for  which Opdivo has already been approved, along with BMY's promising pipeline of treatments for cancer and other diseases. BMYÂ has more than two dozen Phase 3 oncology trials underway, and  almost twice as many Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.
Joe Terril, head of Terril & Co., an independent money manager that has been buying Bristol shares for clients: ""People believed Opdivo was a promising cancer drug one day, and then the next day, it wasn't. They took the stock from $75 to $50. That's nonsense.""

2017-08-24,AZN,Michigan the latest state to act on high drug prices,"Saying they are tired of waiting for Congress to act, Michigan state legislators have introduced a bill that would require drug makers to justify price hikes greater than 10% in one year 30% over five years. Companies who refuse to play along could face penalties of up to $100K a day.
The state joins Maryland and New York who have undertaken similar action. Several months ago, Maryland passed a law allowing the attorney general to intervene if a generic drug's price spikes by 50% in one year or if the price increases while there are no more than three suppliers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo wants to create a board that will determine a ""fair price"" for a medication while aÂ state senator there introduced a bill to control the prices of certain drugs.
Unsurprisingly, Big Pharma and generic drug industry lobbyists are working diligently to oppose such actions. In Ohio, backers of a drug pricing measure recently filed a complaint about the use of confidential contributions, or dark money, to finance efforts to defeat their initiative.

Phase 1b/2 ACE-CL-003 demonstrated that the combination of acalabrutinib and Roche's Gazyva (obinutuzumab) produced a 95% overall response rate (ORR) (n=18/19) in treatment-naive CLL patients and 92% (n=24/26) in treatment-experienced patients. The complete response rates were 16% and 8%, respectively.
On the safety front, there was a long list of adverse events but the grades were not specified. There was one case of serious intermittent atrial fibrillation in a patient with that history, but it was determined to be unrelated to treatment.
Phase 1/2 ACE-CL-001 assessing monotherapy acalabrutinib showed an ORR of 87% with a 4% complete response rate. 18-month progression-free survival was 90%.

2018-01-02,AZN,U.S. drug approvals highest in 21 years,"Reuters reports that the FDA greenlighted 46 new medicines in 2017, the highest tally in 21 years and more than double the total in 2016.
2017's total was actually 49 if cell therapies from Novartis (KYMRIAH) and Gilead Sciences (YESCARTA) and Spark Therapeutics' gene therapy LUXTURNA are included (all were approved under a different category).
The primary reason for the high number of approvals was the FDA's accelerated review process for selected drugs. The number getting the greenlight this year may moderate a bit since several approvals expected this quarter were granted in Q4 2017.
Many eyes are on Europe since the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will be moving to Amsterdam from London this year which may disrupt/delay approvals there. In 2017, the EMA backed 92 new drugs, including generics, up 12% from 2016's total of 81.

+0.8%), upÂ 12%Â since early December, as the competition heats up in the PARP inhibitor space.
AZN received good news today when the FDA approved LYNPARZA (olaparib) for HER2-negative breast cancer patients whose tumors harbor the BRCA mutation, the first such approval worldwide. It is also approved in the U.S. for advanced ovarian cancer patients who have received at least three prior lines of chemo and maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer in patients who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemo, both BRCA-positive.
Clovis' PARP inhibitor Rubraca (rucaparib) was approved in the U.S. in late 2016 for advanced ovarian cancer patients who have received at least two prior lines of chemo and whose tumors harbor the BRCA mutation.
Its U.S. marketing application for same indication as ZEJULA is currently under FDA review with an action date of April 6.
TESARO's PARP inhibitor ZEJULA (niraparib) was OK'd in the U.S. in March 2017 for the maintenance treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian (and fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers) in patients who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemo regardless of their BRCA status. It was approved in Europe in November 2017 for the same indication.

CSRs are company-generated summaries of clinical trial results.
The pilot will launch this month and will include up to nine new drug applications across a range of diseases submitted by participating companies (sponsors). Once completed, the FDA will seek public feedback through a notice in the Federal Register and docket for public comments.

Unlike Europe where biosimilars have made inroads, U.S. drugmakers have been successful in blocking the entry of the lower-priced competition.
Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. has criticized the industry for its ""Kabuki drug-pricing constructs."" One action the agency intends to pursue is making it more difficult for biologic developers to tweak existing patents in order to extend coverage.
He is also concerned with the competition-stifling consolidation in the drug supply chain.

+0.4%) unit Janssen has decided to terminate its Phase 2b/3 clinical trial, EARLY, and a Phase 2 long-term safety study evaluating BACE inhibitor atabecestat for slowing the rate of cognitive decline in patients with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Janssen's decision is another setback for BACE (beta-secretase) inhibition as a treatment approach for patients at risk of developing AD. BACE is an enzyme that plays a key role in the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, characteristic in AD sufferers.

2018-05-31,AZN,FDA issues draft guidance aimed at easing regulatory path for generic drugs,"In a statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. announces draft guidance aimed at curtailing behavior by branded drug makers to delay competition from generics.
The proposed policy will allow generic firms to apply for a waiver of the Single Shared System REMS Requirement permitting them to use a comparable REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program instead of the one used by the branded drug maker.
The rationale for a single REMS program for both branded and generic medications is it makes it easier for medical professionals and distributors to follow safety procedures. Heretofore, generic firms have had to negotiate with branded firms to enter into their REMS program, a predictably long process considering branded companies' lack of enthusiasm for generic competition.

2018-06-01,AZN,ASCO wary of Trump plan to lower drug prices,"Reuters reports that the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is not entirely on board with President Trump's plan to corral drug prices, especially if Medicare is given the authority to negotiate what it pays for cancer meds. The rising cost of cancer care will be a key topic at this week's ASCO conference in Chicago.
Trump's proposal includes the possibility (highly unlikely) that that Medicare will stop covering all approved drugs for certain diseases, including cancer. Industry participants and others have until July 16 to submit feedback on the proposal.
One aspect of reimbursement that is high on the list for action is doctors' fees based on a percentage of the drug's price which creates an incentive to use the most expensive alternatives. ASCO CEO Dr. Clifford Hudis says his organization is not opposed to changing the formula but cautions that oncology practices still need to be paid appropriately for handling specialized medications that require infusion or injection. It opposes a flat-fee model saying itÂ âcould force providers to make suboptimal or lower-value choices.""
According to IQVIA, the U.S. spent $50B last year on cancer drugs, almost double the level from 2012. The amount is projected to double again to $100B in five years.

2018-06-06,AZN,PBMs one-up drug makers on drug copay assistance schemes,"Reuters reports that U.S. drug prices fell 5.6% in Q1, 3.6% more than a year ago. Sector & Sovereign analyst Richard Evans believes most of the decline is from ""copay accumulator"" programs instituted by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) last quarter that do not allow copay assistance payments to contribute toward a patient's deductible before insurance kicks in. He says ~17% of health plans with at least 5K employees use copay accumulators.
The approach forces drugmakers to keep paying out-of-pocket costs for patients or risk reduced demand because of the added expense to consumers. Mr. Evans says makers of costly meds will feel the most pain, including Eli Lilly (LLY
+0.4%), Biogen (BIIB
+0.7%), Gilead Sciences (GILD
+0.9%) and AbbVie (ABBV
-0.1%).
AbbVie chief Rick Gonzalez has admitted that the programs are crimping revenue but says the impact has been immaterial to earnings. In April, Biogen chief Mike Vounatsos said the programs had no impact on Q1 sales.
Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller says, âItâs a constant cat and mouse game. Pharma companies want anything they can get out there that allows them to raise the price of the drug ... Our job is to protect the integrity of the plan.â
Pharma firms remain undeterred in their efforts to drive up prices, however. AbbVie and Amgen (AMGN
+0.7%), for example, have recently begun giving patients prepaid debit cards that cannot be tracked by PBMs in order to sidestep the copay accumulator programs.

The decision is another setback for BACE inhibition. Earlier, Johnson & Johnson bailed on atabecestat on toxicity concerns and Merck did the same with verubecestat due to lack of efficacy.

In a statement, Pfizer says the list prices for the majority of its medicines remain unchanged while some have actually dropped in price. Notable exceptions include Chantix, hiked 7% after a 9.4% increase in January, and Viagra, bumped 9.4% after a similar hike in January.

2018-07-05,AZN,Insurers making headway on corralling drug costs with copay accumulators,"Reuters reports that drug makers are ""scrambling"" to limit the financial impact of copay accumulator programs by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). The scheme, which forces drug manufacturers to pony up more money to assist patients with copay costs or face declining demand for their pricey meds as patients face higher out-of-pocket expenses, has gained traction and is expected to become more widely adopted next year.
Drug firms have implemented new tactics to evade detection by PBMs so patients can still receive financial benefits but specific details about how they work are scarce. They are also taking a tougher stance in pricing negotiations.
According to Sector and Sovereign Research, real U.S. drug prices dropped 5.6% in Q1.
CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) says its accumulator programs has enabled it to cut specialty drug spending by ~5%. Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) intend to expand their programs.

The law, requiring drug makers to give advance notice of significant price increases, is designed to pressure companies to keep prices down. It appears to be working.
In the past several weeks, Novartis (NYSE:NVS), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) have notified California health plans rolling back or reducing price hikes on at least 10 drugs.
Pharma companies are far from accepting the new reality, however. Its lobbying group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, is challenging the law in court.

2018-07-18,AZN,FDA committed to easing approval path for biosimilars,"In remarks prepared for a presentation to the Brookings Institution, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. says the agency is committed to doing its part to reduce healthcare costs, especially as its relates to biosimilars. So far, the market impact of the 11 biosimilars approved in the U.S. to date has been minimal, considering that eight are not even available yet due to various tactics by branded manufacturers to stymie the competition.
Citing the oversized 40% contribution branded biologics have on prescription drug spending, biologics represented 70% of the growth in said spending from 2010 - 2015, he says the agency is enacting programs aimed at more efficient biosimilar development and approval.
Its Biosimilars Action PlanÂ includes developing and implementing new FDA review tools, such as standardized review templates, new information sources and development tools for sponsors and (potential) data-sharing agreements ex-U.S. regulators. It also includes the establishment of a new Office of Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars to improve coordination and support the activities under the Biosimilar User Fee Act.

2018-07-31,AZN,U.S. healthcare spending nearing 20% of GDP,"The WSJ reports that healthcare spending in the U.S. will soon reach 20% of GDP, a significantly higher proportion than any other major economy. The key cost driver has been price hikes, not increased demand. Since 1960, the CPI has risen ~700% while medical costs have risen 2,000%. Since 2000, prescription drug costs have grown 69%, hospital care 60% and physician and clinical services 23%.
Despite leading the world in healthcare spending, the U.S. lags other developed countries in many major measures of health, including life expectancy, the incidence of diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease and infant mortality.
Consumers continue to be shielded from the bulk of the costs through insurance and tax breaks while corporations are able to deduct the costs of providing health insurance from their taxes, estimated at $854B last year.
Since 1985, the percentage of expenditures for healthcare for consumers has risen from less than 5% to 8%.
The average market price of AbbVie's HUMIRA was $1,385 (95% of list) in Q3 2004 and $3,431 (84% of list) in Q3 2016, reflecting, in part, increasing rent from PBMs.
Consolidation in hospitals have given them more clout to demand higher prices from insurers. For example, in markets with monopoly hospitals, the cost of a lower limb MRI is over 23% more than markets with at least four hospitals.
The percentage of S&P 500 revenues reported by healthcare companies has risen from 4% in 1985 to almost 16% last year (the profit percentage would be more informative considering consolidation within the sector).
Healthcare companies have more than doubled lobbying spending since 1998, creating a headwind against meaningful changes to the status quo.

2018-08-23,AZN,Oklahoma first state to negotiate efficacy-based drug prices,"Reuters reports that Oklahoma is the first state where its Medicaid program is negotiating prescription drug prices based on how well they work in practice. CMS signed off on allowing the state to employ the approach two months ago.
The first contract to be inked was with Alkermes plc (ALKS
-1%) for schizophrenia med ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil). The agreed-upon price decreases every other month as long as the prescription is refilled (compliance with drug regimens is a major problem in this patient population). The longer the patient takes the drug, the better the rebate.
Contracts for an expensive antibiotic and an epilepsy drug are nearing completion.
By law, state Medicaid programs, key buyers in the $450B U.S. prescription drug market, received a mandatory 23% discount of list which, of course, does nothing to constrain costs since most drug companies hike prices one or two times each year. State Medicaid administrators often negotiate additional rebates for individual medicines.
Michigan is reportedly pursuing CMS approval to try its hand at Oklahoma's initiative. Colorado says it is in the ""early planning stages"" for a similar move.

Orphan Drug-tagged Lumoxiti is an anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin. It consists of an antibody that binds to protein found on B-lymphocytes (CD22) that is fused to a toxin. Once the molecule is internalized by the cancer cell, the toxin leads to cell death by inhibiting protein translation. Specifically, the cell cannot read the information from messenger RNA so it cannot build proteins and dies.

Over time, pharmacies and the rest of the supply chain can transition to a new pricing model allowing the drug maker to retire the high-priced product.

Bloomberg reports that Amgen (AMGN

In another predictable tactic, one that Pfizer (and every other member of Big Pharma) has used for years to protect its banded drug franchises from generic competition, competitors are using exclusionary contracting to maintain their branded businesses. Pfizer has filed litigation against J&J aimed at breaking through contractual barriers.

2018-10-02,AZN,FDA issues new draft guidance aimed at speedier generic approvals,"In a statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., outlines new draft guidance that he says should improve the process for reviewing generic drug marketing applications and boost competition in the prescription drugs market.
The main focus appears to be more discerning scrutiny of citizen petitions, used by branded drug makers to delay generic approvals due to the diversion of agency resources to review them. Specifically, the agency will determine if a particular petition was filed to delay a generic approval and, if so, may deny it. In its annual report to Congress, it plans to highlight those petitions that it considered to be aimed at delaying generic competition. It also intends to make all petition responses public.
If the FDA receives a citizen petition within 150 days of the action date for its review of a generic drug marketing application, then it will respond to the petition within that time frame.
The Commissioner also mentions branded drugmakers' competition-thwarting tactic of delaying access to a sufficient quantity of branded product to support bioequivalence studies, but he offers no specific remedy in his statement.

-1.6%), Eli Lilly (LLY
-1.5%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ
-0.9%), responding to the federal government's proposed inclusion of prices in TV drug ads generally support the value of increased transparency for patients, but caution that it needs to be done fairly.
They say that including just the list price will confuse patients since most are only responsible for co-payments. Some may not fill prescriptions if they perceive that they will have to pay the full monty (shockingly high in many cases).
J&J says that if list price disclosures are required for drugs, then hospitals, health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers should play by similar rules.
Sanofi was the least supportive, regarding CMS's proposal as ""oversimplified"" since would fail to grasp the ""nuance and complexity"" of prescription drugs and biologics.
The trade association, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), has proposed its own voluntary guidelines that will take effect in April. It prefers to link drug price information to ads and wants to partner with advocacy groups on an online patient affordability platform that will allow them to access information on insurance coverage, co-payments and other factors in addition to drug prices.
The 60-day comment period ended last month. CMS will now decide on the specific regulation. Legal challenges are a near certainty if prices are required in advertisements.

Drug firms will, no doubt, notify their lobbyists on this development.

2019-01-11,AZN,Dem lawmakers introduce bill to lower U.S. drug prices,"On the heels of a new round of price increases by drug firms and worn-out patience waiting for President Trump to follow through his campaign promise, Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Representative Elijah Cummings (D-MD 7th District) have introduced a bill aimed at reining in drug prices.
Their bill, similar to the Trump administration's idea to benchmark U.S. drug prices to Europe's, would create an ""international pricing index"" as a means to more closely align the U.S. with other countries.
It would also allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate prices under Medicare Part D and allow Americans to purchase medicines from Canada and other countries.
Predictably, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's top lobbying organization, is opposed, saying the bill would ""interfere with patient access to medicine while also undermining the U.S. intellectual property system, replicating the flawed policies of foreign governments and circumventing the FDA's robust safety standards.""
Drugmakers blame pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) for the problem saying they continue to demand ever-increasing rents for inclusion on formularies.
Several drugmakers maintained prices for a short while last year, but reinstituted increases this month on more than 250 medications, including top seller Humira at AbbVie. On the plus side, the increases were more modest, with almost all being less than 10%.

2019-01-15,AZN,FDA Commish touts advances/successes,"In a stream of tweets, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. details a number of accomplishments and advances by the agency. Highlights:
Federal government shutdown: About 400 (or 410) staffers are returning to work to conduct key inspections: ~150 in food, ~100 in high-risk medical device manufacturing, ~70 in high-risk drug manufacturing and ~90 in high-risk biologic manufacturing. They plan to work without pay this week.
Generics and biosimilar programs will be negatively impacted if the shutdown persists. Carryover fees are funding the work at present. Higher-risk products are being prioritized.
Seven biosimilars were approved in 2018, raising the cumulative total to 16. 70 programs are in process.
Five generic drugs were approved last year under the new competitive generic therapy designation (accelerated revenue and 180 days of market exclusivity). ""First generics"" comprised almost 10% of the 971 generic drug applications approved in fiscal 2018 (no prior generic was on the market). The total number of approvals was a record for the agency. 1,021 were approved in calendar 2018.

50 new clinical reviewers will be added (certainly contingent on the resolution of the federal government impasse between President Trump and Congress).
New policy guidance will be issued this year. The agenda includes working with sponsors to make maximum use of accelerated programs, including regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT)Â designation, a series of clinical guidance documents to inform product development, including gene therapies for blood disorders, and how to use the accelerated approval pathway in cases where the gene therapy addresses the underlying genetic defect.
The guidance will also include information designed to help in the development of CAR-T therapies (and other cellular products) and to promote a better understanding of the critical factors in manufacturing with the goal of allowing minor manufacturing changes without requiring new bridging studies.

2019-01-16,AZN,Hospitals squeezed by high drug costs,"A study funded by the American Hospital Association, Federation of American Hospitals and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists found that total drug spend per hospital admission rose 18.5% between 2015 and 2017, adding $1.8M in additional costs for an average hospital.
Outpatient drug spending per admission rose almost 30% while inpatient spending for medicines rose 10%. Price hikes as high as 80% or more occurred in anesthetics, parenteral solutions, opioid agonists and chemo.
More than 90% of hospitals surveyed had to identify alternative therapies to mitigate the impact of price increases and drug shortages. One in four had to downsize staff.
The price of Roche's stroke med Activase increased 19% to $4,143. Johnson & Johnson's Remicade, AbbVie's Humira and Amgen's Enbrel increased between 15 - 21%.
The majority of hospitals reported that competition had little effect on prices. Two of the 10 most expensive drugs in fiscal 2017 had generic or biosimilar alternatives enter the market in 2016, but the two still increased 4.1%, albeit more modestly than the 14.4% average hike among the other eight.
About 750 hospitals have joined a non-profit venture called Civica Rx aimed at managing drug costs and supply.

The potential panacea for cancer victims, developed with the company's combinatorial biology screening platform technology calledÂ SoAP, is called MuTaTo (multi-target toxin), sort of a cancer ""antibiotic.""
CEO Dr. Ilan Morad explains that MuTaTo, which uses a combination of three cancer cell-targeting peptides together with a strong peptide toxin, is designed to kill cancer cells specifically while mitigating mutations that can compromise the effectiveness of antibody-based therapeutics. He adds that MuTaTo will also kill cancer stem cells and slow-growing cancer cells, completely ridding the body of cancer cells that can sidestep other therapies. It is also a small molecule that lacks a rigid structure which should enable it to avoid provoking an immune response.
On the safety front, an exploratory experiment on mice expressing human cancer cell growth showed no ill effects.

HHS wants to remove the discounts drug makers pay to PBMs, Medicare and managed care plans from safe harbor protection under anti-kickback laws, but allow price reductions given to patients at the pharmacy counter.
Another proposed safe harbor would allow PBMs to earn a flat service fee from manufacturers for services rendered, such as medical education or data monitoring/management.
PBMs currently earn a percentage of the list price of drugs which keeps driving prices up.
HHS also wants more transparency on PBM deals with drugmakers.

The designation, called Competitive Generic Therapies (CGT), provides for more intensive FDA guidance on development as well as a shorter review clock. An approved abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for a CGT-tagged generic medicine will also enjoy a 180-day period of market exclusivity (no real change here since this is the same exclusivity period for an approved ""first-to-file"" application).
Dr. Gottlieb says the agency has signed off on 100 CGT requests to date with five ANDAs approved in 2018 (August - December).

-0.7%) CEO Giovanni Caforio; Pfizer (CEO
+0.1%) CEO Albert Bourla and Sanofi (SNY
+1.6%) CEO Dr. Oliver Brandicourt.
In their opening statements, the executives defended drug innovation in the U.S. but acknowledged that problems with escalating prices exist and should be fixed, including excessive prices on older off-patent drugs with no competition, the slow rate of biosimilar and generic approvals/introductions and ever-rising out-of-pocket costs for patients.

Update: Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) challenged AbbVie's Gonzalez over the lower price of Humira in Europe versus the U.S. and the absence of domestic biosimilar competition until 2023.

Update: Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) asked what keeps the execs ""up at night"" and all cite the need for innovative drugs to treat difficult-to-treat diseases.

Update: Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) is questioning the amount of promotional investments versus R&D investments. She is challenging AbbVie's patent thicket protecting top seller Humira, adding that the company charges more for the drug in the U.S. because ""it can.""

Update: Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA): Asking if states' ability to negotiate drug prices leads to lower prices for patients. Chastising witnesses over their lack of acknowledgement that market forces could lower prices.

Update: Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH): Challenging J&J's

Update: Sen. John Cornyn III (R-TX): Questioning appropriateness of AbbVie's patent thicket protecting Humira, says the total time of protection excessive.

Update:Â Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ): Says if drugmakers don't address high prices, ""policymakers will."" Asked if any of the companies used their recent tax breaks to lower prices, most said that they used the money to fund R&D. Asked all if they restrict access to branded drugs to would-be generic competitors for comparability studies, all said no.

Update: Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE): Asking if co's support price transparency, elimination of rebates. All support.

Update: Sen. John Thune (R-SD): Asking about the viability of a bifurcated system (private vs. public). AbbVie's Gonzalez defending merits of competition on drug prices (ignoring the obvious contradiction with Humira).

Update: Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA): Questioning who sets prices and rebates. Suggests concentrating on PBM and insurer (intermediaries)Â roles in price inflation. Patients are not benefitting from discounts since they are being captured by the intermediaries.

Update: Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD): Asking why U.S. can't move to a system more akin to Europe with its lower prices. Asking why CMS shouldn't negotiate Medicare prices nationwide. CEOs are not offering much of a rebuttal except touting the virtues of competition.

Update: Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH): Challenging J&J's Taubert over company's behavior in promoting opioids.",0.1703595072031021,0.797528862953186,0.03211164101958275

Provide the FDA will more latitude to dismiss sham citizen petitions submitted by branded drug makers to delay generic competition.
Allow HHS more flexibility in negotiating Part B drug prices by permitting the consolidation of certain drugs under Part B into Part D when savings are possible from competition. Beneficiary cost-sharing for all drugs shifted from Part B to Part D may be counted toward the out-of-pocket limit for Part D plans.
HHS will be allowed to initiate new contracts with drug makers on a quarterly basis, instead of yearly, reducing the number of ""piggy back"" deals between drug firms to get coverage as soon as possible.
All Part B drug makers will be required to submit average sales price (ASP) data (some currently don't). Scofflaws will face penalties as high as $10K/day if the data are not reported within 30 days after the end of the quarter.
Medicare payment rate for single-source Part B drugs will be reduced to 103% of the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) from 106%.
Up to five state Medicaid programs will have the opportunity to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers in a proof-of-concept-type initiative to determine its feasibility.
Eliminate pass-through payments for drugs, biologics and biosimilars from the Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), making them eligible for reduced 340B payment or bundling under the OPPS.
Elimination of cost-sharing for low-income Medicare beneficiaries for generics, biosimilars and preferred multiple-source drugs ($0 out-of-pocket costs).

2019-03-12,AZN,Trump aiming to rein in drug cost with range of proposals,"President Trump's 2020 budget includes variety of proposed initiatives to address drug prices. Highlights:
Reduce Medicare reimbursement for a branded drug from average sales price (ASP) plus 6% to ASP -33% if the drug maker files a pay-for-delay agreement or employs other anti-competitive action once a generic/biosimilar alternative is commercially available (unclear on who will adjudicate this). Once a generic product is available, CMS will reimburse both the branded and generic product at ASP plus 6%.
Generic drug makers will no longer be able to thwart other generic competitors by intentionally delaying final FDA approval in order to avoid triggering the 180-day exclusivity period for the first filer (a certain loophole will be closed).
Promote the development and commercialization of biosimilars by loosening the separate standards designed specifically for drugs as issued by the U.S. Pharmacopeia.
Codify the FDA's approach to determining a new chemical entity (NCE). Five-year NCE status will only apply to drugs with significant changes to their chemical structure compared to current drugs.

Critics say the rule, if implemented, would not have made a material impact on pricing anyway since there was no enforcement mechanism for scofflaws. The assumption was that the private sector would police itself.

The study met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in disease activity compared to placebo (control arm patients also received SOC treatment) as measured by a scale called BICLA at week 52.
The positive BICLA response was consistent with an earlier Phase 3, TULIP 1, which failed to achieve the primary endpoint as measured by a different scale called SRI4.
Data from both trials will be submitted for presentation at a future medical conference.
Anifrolumab (formerly MEDI-546) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the type 1 interferon (IFN) receptor that inhibits the activity of all type 1 IFNs which play a key role in SLE. The company is counting on it to be one of its top growth drivers.

2019-10-15,AZN,Pelosi drug bill would save $345B - CBO,"A preliminary analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-CA 12th District) bill to lower drug prices would save Medicare $345B between 2023 and 2029 by allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiated lower prices on up to 250 drugs per year, with savings applied to both Medicare and people with private insurance.
Democrats quickly endorsed the numbers while Republicans countered that lower drug maker revenues, expected to be $500B - $1T over 10 years, would dampen new drug development, possibly leading to 8-15 fewer new medicines coming to market over the next 10 years.
The CBO has yet to complete its analysis, but says the overall effect from increased use of prescription drugs versus the decreased availability of new drugs is ""unclear.""
House Republicans want to work with Dems on more modest drug pricing legislation such as speeding the introduction of generics. Whatever bill they endorse is unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate since Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has already vowed to block it.

2019-11-04,AZN,Boston nonprofit playing big role in drug pricing,"The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a Boston-based nonpartisan nonprofit with no policy-making role, has emerged as a major influencer on pricing by drugmakers.
Examples include Sanofi (SNY
+0.6%) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN
+0.3%) high cholesterol med Praluent initially priced at $14,600/year, now $4,500 after rebates (heavily influenced by Amgen's (AMGN
-0.8%) Repatha, though), Amgen's migraine med Aimovig (erenumab-aooe), $6,900 from $10,000 and Novartis' (NVS
+0.6%) SMA gene therapy Zolgensma, $2.1M from estimates as high as $5M.
The pricing moderator appears to be ICER's economic model aimed at determining the fair price for medical care based on a concept called QALY or quality-adjusted life-year. It puts a dollar figure on a year of healthy life, calculates how much health a drug restores to a sick patient, then determines the fair price for the value delivered up to a maximum of $150K (based on how much Americans are willing to pay for healthcare and how much healthcare expenditure compares to per-capita income around the world).
The QALY concept has been used for over 50 years in various countries but, unsurprisingly, not so much in the U.S. since drug firms have long-opposed such models due to the perception that such pricing systems could lead Medicare to refuse payment for pricey meds.
Praluent's net price is consistent with ICER's recommended range for high-risk patients ($4,500 - 8,000) as is Aimovig with its recommended price for migraine sufferers.
Countries use a wide range of QALY thresholds, however, from Belgium's ~$190K to Thailand's, a small fraction of Belgium's.
ICER's initially focused on pricey procedures, like new radiation therapies, but switched to drugs when Gilead Sciences (GILD
+0.7%) launched hepatitis C med Sovaldi in 2013 at $1,000 per pill.

The data were presented at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week in Washington, DC.
All six studies met the primary efficacy endpoint of mean hemoglobin change from baseline versus control.
Roxadustat is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor ofÂ hypoxia-inducible factorÂ (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase. HIF is a protein transcription factor that ""turns on"" the production of red blood cells (erythropoiesis). Its value proposition is the ability to maintain hemoglobin levels without affecting inflammation and potentially avoiding the need for ongoing intravenous iron repletion therapy as needed with epoetin alfa.

-6%) roxadustat in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who recently initiated dialysis met both primary endpoints. The data were presented at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week in Washington, DC.
The open-label study randomized participants 1:1 to receive either roxadustat or epoetin alfa (originally marketed by Amgen under the brand name Epogen) for up to 4.4 years (mean duration of treatment was 1.8 years).
Results showed that treatment with roxadustat increased mean hemoglobin levels from 8.4 g/dL to 11.0 g/dL compared to an increase from 8.4 g/dL to 10.8 g/dL for epoetin alfa demonstrating its non-inferiority (no worse than).
Roxadustat was also non-inferior to epoetin alfa in terms of the proportion of patients achieving a hemoglobin response during the first 24 weeks of treatment (88.2% vs. 84.4%).
Patients receiving roxadustat also required less monthly intravenous iron on average.
On the safety front, the most frequent roxadustat-related adverse events were hypertension, diarrhea and muscle spasms.
Collaboration partner AstraZeneca (AZN
-0.2%) will be presenting data from two Phase 3s, OLYMPUS and ROCKIES, assessing roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in non-dialysis and dialysis-dependent CKD patients at the meeting.

2019-11-20,AZN,Launch of new generic drugs in U.S. still lags - WSJ,"The Wall Street Journal reports that less than 2/3 (n=1,249) of generic drugs approved in the U.S. between 2016 - 2018 are on the market. Only 30% (n=134/442) of the medicines approved last year have gone on sale.
The main reason for the lack of market presence is legal tie-ups, specifically, patent litigation from branded drug makers that can take years to resolve [current regulations stipulate an automatic 30-month stay on a generic approval to allow patent disputes to run their course, which, of course, guarantees a lawsuit regardless of the robustness of the patent(s)].
The breakdown is most acute in biologics. Only 11 biosimilars are available commercially in the U.S. despite 25 approvals since 2015 (pay-to-delay deals, which should be illegal, are a major reason).
According to the Federal Trade Commission, which tracks patents settlements, fewer of these agreements are likely to be anticompetitive (?), although the number of settlements is increasing.

2020-02-21,AZN,Dems attack Trump over stalled efforts to lower drug prices,"High drug prices will, again, be a key issue in the 2020 Presidential campaign considering that President Trump has made scant progress on the matter despite much rhetoric.
White House press secretary Judd Deere says drug prices fell last year for the first time in 50 years under Mr. Trump's leadership, but theÂ U.S. Labor Department says prescription medicines rose 3% last year, less than the norm, but an increase nonetheless.

Corralling prices will be a tough slog in light of the industry's well-funded lobbying and legal horsepower. For example, Mr. Trump's plan to force drug firms to include list prices in TV ads ran aground in July 2019 when a federal court blocked it after Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) sued. His proposal to tie drug prices to those paid by certain other countries has stalled as well.
Democrats are already attacking the President on his lack of concrete results. Michael Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar have all taken recent shots at Mr. Trump in attempts to put him on the defensive. According to a recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 54% of Americans disapprove of the White House's handling of drug costs.
More than 60 drugmakers raised prices in early January, albeit at lower rates, according to Rx Savings Solutions.
Mr. Trump has had some success. The FDA has implemented a faster process for generic drug approvals and he signed legislation empowering pharmacists and insurers to inform consumers that they could pay less out-of-pocket for certain medications. The administration also supports the reimportation of drugs from Canada but Canadian officials have shown little enthusiasm for the idea.

2020-06-05,AZN,China in thick of race for COVID-19 vaccine,"Aimed squarely at the prestige from being first in the global race for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, China's government, including the military and several state-backed companies, has committed ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars and cleared regulatory barriers to accelerate R&D.
Domestic drugmakers have already been ramping up production as Chairman Xi Jinping has committed to share a domestically developed vaccine with the world.
Five Chinese companies are behind five of 10 vaccine candidates being testing in humans according to WHO. Two are being developed by state-run China National Biotec Group Co.
Another group, tied to China's military, has received the nod to run a late-stage study in Canada.
Tianjin-based CanSino Biologics, together with the military, was the first to publish study results (Phase 1) in an established medical journal (The Lancet).
China is a step behind with vaccine-making technologies, however. Four of the candidates in clinical trials were produced by an older method using inactivated viruses, the same approach long-used for flu, hepatitis A, polio and rabies vaccines. Moderna's top candidate, currently in a Phase 2 trial, is an RNA vaccine.
Privately held Sinovac Biotech Ltd., along with several government entities, is conducting Phase 1 & 2 studies on its candidate in Jiangsu province.
Regardless of who wins the race, Chinese companies should play a key role in vaccine manufacturing considering their capacities. The country is already one of the top producers in the world.
Both the China and the U.S. expect to have a vaccine available by year-end.

The data were virtually presented at the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association Congress.
The study demonstrated the non-inferiority (no worse than) of roxadustat to Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) Aranesp (darbepoetin alfa) as measured by hemoglobin response up to week 24. Specifically, the change in hemoglobin in the roxadustat cohort was 89.5%, compared to 78.0% in the darbepoetin alfa cohort.
Roxadustat demonstrated superiority over darbepoetin alfa in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol), a secondary endpoint.
The safety profiles were similar.
The company's marketing application in Europe is under EMA review.
Roxadustat is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor ofÂ hypoxia-inducible factorÂ (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase. HIF is a protein transcription factor that ""turns on"" the production of red blood cells (erythropoiesis). Its value proposition is the ability to maintain hemoglobin levels without affecting inflammation and potentially avoiding the need for ongoing intravenous iron repletion therapy as needed with bone marrow stimulating agents like Aranesp and Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Procrit (epoetin alfa).

The agency says it will not approve any candidate unless safety and efficacy have been clearly shown in a clinical study, an obvious criterion, nor if the vaccine simply leads to antibodies in the bloodstream (due to the uncertainty of knowing what level of antibodies confer immunity against the SARS-Cov-2 virus).
It will also require a vaccine maker to conduct further safety monitoring post approval and will recommend following all vaccinated people for a year.
The FDA has drawn criticism over its quick approvals allowing the emergency use of diagnostic tests and certain drugs during the pandemic. After a number of the tests were found to be poor performers, it tightened its review process and rescinded EUA on some assays. It OK'd the emergency use of malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine then backtracked after neither proved effective in treating the respiratory infection.

-0.8%)] in 1077 healthy volunteers showed a positive effect.
543 were assigned to receive a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (dosed atÂ 5Ã10Â¹â° viral particles)Â and 534 assigned to receive a single dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) which served as a control. 10 participants were enrolled in the non-randomized ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime boost group (two doses 28 days apart).
At data cutoff, neutralizing antibody responses were observed in 91% (n=32/35) of participants after one dose via one measurement and 100% (n=35/35) via another. In the prime boost group, all subjects showed neutralizing antibody activity.
Marked increases in SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific effector T cell responses were observed as early as day 7, peaking at day 14 and maintained up to day 56 as expected with adenoviral vectors.
On the safety front, there were no serious adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccine but there were higher rates of local and systemic adverse events (pain, headache, chills, fever, muscle aches/injection site pain, tenderness, redness, swelling), many reduced via prophylactic paracetamol (acetaminophen).
Per the authors, limitations of the study include the short follow-up period to date, the small number of participants in the prime boost group and single-blinded design. Also, the volunteers were ""fairly young"" (median age of 35) and healthy and mostly Caucasian.
Phase 3 studies are underway in Brazil, South Africa and the UK.

2020-07-27,AZN,EU talks to procure COVID-19 supply stalled over financial issues,"Reuters reports that negotiations between the Europe Union (EU) and COVID-19 vaccine developers Pfizer (PFE
-0.8%), Sanofi (SNY
+2.0%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ
-0.1%) have bogged down due to disagreements over price, payment method and potential liability costs.
The EU is in talks with at least six vaccine makers to secure upfront supplies of vaccines if and when available, including Moderna (MRNA
+7.3%) and Germany's CureVac AG (CVAC).
Sanofi is negotiating to supply 300M doses of the candidate it is developing with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK
+1.2%) and wants an immediate upfront payment for the entire stock according to two officials, a demand that has caused some ""hurdles.""
Pfizer and development partner BioNTech (BNTX
-1.1%) want the EU to pay for 500M doses only if their vaccine is authorized for sale, a move that would mitigate the risk if the vaccine proves unsuccessful but could substantially raise the cost if it works.
Further complicating matters are doubts from certain EU negotiators about mRNA (Moderna, CureVac).
By comparison, the U.S. has already inked supply agreements with AstraZeneca (AZN
+0.5%) and Pfizer among its funding deals. The agreed-upon $40 per treatment course it too bullish for Europe say officials.

The results were just published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Treatment with nirsevimab, an extended half-life RSV monoclonal antibody, resulted in a 78.4% relative reduction in the incidence of hospitalization due to RSV LRTI through day 150, a secondary endpoint.
The rate of serious adverse events in the treatment arm was 11.2% versus 16.9% in the control arm, none deemed related to nirsevimab.
Passive immunization, which offers immediate protection, means that nirsevimab is given directly to an infant to help prevent RSV. Active immunization is when the person's immune system is activated to prevent or fight infection via a vaccine, a process that could take weeks for protection to develop.
Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 studies are in process in full-term, healthy late preterm and high-risk infants.

2020-08-06,AZN,Current value of COVID-19 vaccine players overly bullish - Leerink,"In a note, SVB Leerink warns that the current $115B aggregate valuation for COVID-19 vaccine developers is, unsurprisingly, overly optimistic.
Analysts, led by Daina Graybosch, claim that the lofty estimates assume vaccines will be administered every two years in perpetuity at a price north of $37 per American and that global vaccination rates will exceed those for influenza. Current valuations also reflect more government contracts for excess supply and profits similar to branded medicines.
Ms. Graybosch adds, ""The initial coronavirus vaccination campaign will need to be 86% larger than global influenza vaccination and much more profitable just to support the current valuation, by our estimates."" Any shortfall on these assumptions ""materially lowers the expected value of this portfolio of products.""
She is not totally bearish on the group, raising her price target on BioNTech (BNTX
-5.1%) to $69 (from $42) after ""reassessing"" its chances of success. The U.S. government's decision on its option to purchase 500M more doses of its vaccine could swing shares by $10 in either direction.

+0.5%)/BioNTech (BNTX
+1.6%), Moderna (MRNA
-1.4%) and AstraZeneca (AZN
+0.3%).
The company has not disclosed the specific reasons behind the bigger study which, by definition, will be more expensive and time-consuming, although a spokesperson said that it wants âto enroll a robust number of participants who are representative of those populations affected by COVID-19,â and to determine the safety, efficacy, durability and optimal dosing regimens of the vaccine.
According to Vanderbilt University School of Medicine's William Schaffner, achieving the numbers needed to show that the vaccine works could happen more quickly if more people are enrolled.
J&J is using epidemiology and modeling data to plan the locations of ~180 trial sites in the U.S. and eight other countries with high rates of COVID-19. Recruitment is underway. Participants will be followed for two years but preliminary results will be available much sooner.
A big selling point of Ad26.COV2.S is that it is a single shot instead of two.",0.03584069013595581,0.9263326525688171,0.03782663866877556

2020-08-22,AZN,Investors in COVID-19 stocks face turmoil in coming weeks on vaccine data readouts,"Investing in companies with COVID-19 pipeline candidates, both treatments and vaccines, has been a winner since March but there is a near-certainty of rough seas next month and beyond when companies release results from ongoing studies and new large-scale trials.
Aimed at quick approval, the FDA has set a relatively low bar for vaccine efficacy, 50% compared to placebo, so the first to report, assuming positive data, should see a spike in buying with commensurate softness in certain competitors. Gains in early leaders may quickly evaporate if subsequent data readouts show better immunogenicity as investors react to new frontrunners.
An indicator of the probable winners may be government supply contracts. In the U.S., the feds have inked deals with Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech(NASDAQ:BNTX), Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). In Europe (including the UK), AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) [partnering with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK)], Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Novavax, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Valneva (OTCPK:INRLF) and CureVac (NASDAQ:CVAC) have closed deals with more on the way (including JNJ).
On the treatment front, support may soften for Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) on perceived waning demand for Veklury (remdesivir) and antibody treatments being developed by such firms as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) if vaccine data are impressive.
Pfizer and partner BioNTechÂ reported positive preliminary data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 study of vaccine candidate BNT162b1 on August 12. Pfizer intends to seek emergency use authorization in the U.S. as early as October.
NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) launched a 30K-subject Phase 3 study in late July testing Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine candidate mRNA-1273. Enrollment should be completed by month-end or the early part of September.

2020-08-24,AZN,AstraZeneca up 4% on rumored fast track approval of COVID-19 vaccine in U.S.,"Despite rumors to the contrary, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) says it has held no talks with the U.S. government about emergency use authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine, currently dubbed AZD1222.
Yesterday, The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration was mulling a plan to do just that if data from a 10K-subject UK study are positive. Preliminary results should be available next month.
The FDA has stated that an approval of any COVID-19 vaccine will need to be supported by data from a trial involving at least 30K people. AZN is launching such a study in the U.S. but results may not be available until after the November 3rd election.
At a press conference yesterday to announce emergency use authorization of convalescent plasma for the respiratory infection, President Trump hinted that a similar nod for a vaccine might be imminent.
Leading Democrats say the White House must not approve a vaccine without sufficient data to support approval. FDA division chief Peter Marks, whose group oversees vaccine approvals, told Reuters that he will resign if the Trump administration pressures the agency to approve a vaccine without adequate data showing its safety and effectiveness.
Other vaccine developers at the head of the pack include Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), who expects to complete enrollment in its large-scale trial by the end of next month, and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) who have recruited about 1/3 of the planned participants in their study and have stated that their candidate, BNT162b2, will be ready for regulatory review in October.

2020-08-25,AZN,Can you get coronavirus a second time? A new study says yes,"Researchers at the University of Hong Kong say they have proved the ""first case"" of reinfection of COVID-19, marking the first such documented case in the world.
The virus strains contracted by a 33-year-old man in April (while living in Hong Kong) and August (after he returned from Spain) were ""clearly different,"" meaning he was not a ""persistent carrier"" of the virus from his prior infection.
""Many believe that recovered COVID-19 patients have immunity against re-infection because most developed a serum neutralizing antibody response. However, there is evidence that some patients have waning antibody level after a few months,"" the researchers declared. ""Our findings suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 may persist in the global human population as is the case for other common cold-associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection.""
The study has been accepted by the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal, though other experts are calling for more research.
""The finding does not mean taking vaccines will be useless,"" Dr. Kai-Wang To, one of the leading authors of the paper, told Reuters. ""Immunity induced by vaccination can be different from those induced by natural infection,"" he added. ""[We] will need to wait for the results of the vaccine trials to see if how effective vaccines are.""

2020-08-26,AZN,Baird notes hot competition marks heavy headwinds for a COVID-19 treatment maker,"Recent momentum on COVID-19 vaccine development has created mixed outlooks for the developers of treatments for the disease - which could face waning demand if the vaccines provide impressive data.
And surely, as the Trump administration continues to push for emergency use authorization, rallies in vaccine players are accompanied by pressure on antibody treatment makers like Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN).

Meanwhile, while Vir has some enthusiastic supporters on Wall Street - with a high price target of $75 and consensus around $47 - Baird took note of the company getting passed by again, with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)
starting its COVID-19 mAb trial (for AZD7442).
And considering Vir's outperformance through the pandemic, another Big Pharma clinical entrant ahead of Vir's VIR-7831 marks a significant challenge for the company.
A key bear argument for Vir, Baird says, is the presence of Big Pharma rivals that have ""raced past VIR-7831 into the clinic,"" including Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Regeneron, with programs already in late-stage studies.
And while bulls might argue the macro opportunity is ""potentially so vast that you can have multiple winners,"" Madhu Kumar writes, it's hard to imagine being a third or fourth-place entrant into a therapeutic class can support Vir's $4B increase in valuation. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests a $1B value for VIR-7831, Kumar says, assuming: similar market size to Gilead's remdesivir, a 3x valuation multiple, a one-third market share (maybe generous now that AstraZeneca is in the mix) and a 40% launch probability.

The results were consistent in patients both with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D).
The primary composite endpoint was â¥50% sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), onset of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and CV or renal death.
The absolute risk reduction (ARR) was 5.3% over the median time in study of 2.4 years. The trial also met all secondary endpoints, including significantly reducing death from any cause by 31% (ARR = 2.1%, p=0.0035) compared to placebo.  Farxiga is the first medicine to significantly prolong the survival of patients with CKD with and without T2D and to demonstrate benefit in treating both heart failure and CKD in diabetic patients, and reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure and nephropathy in T2D.
Patients treated with FARXIGA experienced fewer serious adverse events compared to placebo (29.5% vs. 33.9%, respectively).
In May 2020, Farxiga was approved in the US to reduce the risk of CV death and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF). It is also indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control and to reduce the risk of hHF in adults with T2D.

2020-09-01,AZN,AstraZeneca starts U.S. final-stage trial of COVID-19 vaccine,"AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) has expanded development of its COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 into Phase III clinical trial in the U.S. to assess its safety, efficacy and immunogenicity.
Trial centres across U.S. are recruiting up to 30K adults aged 18 years or over. Sites in Peru and Chile are planned to initiate recruitment shortly.
Participants are being randomised to receive two doses of either AZD1222 or a saline control, four weeks apart. The trial is assessing efficacy and safety of the vaccine in all participants, and local and systemic reactions and immune responses will be assessed in 3K participants.
In July 2020, interim results from the ongoing Phase I/II COV001 trial were published in The Lancet and showed AZD1222 was tolerated and generated robust immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Researchers are testing 36 vaccines in clinical trials on humans, and at least 90 preclinical vaccines are under active investigation in animals.

NIAID's Dr. Anthony Fauci and the FDA's Dr. Stephen Hahn have both stated that a vaccine could be available to certain groups, such as front-line healthcare workers, before clinical trials are completed, if the data are strongly positive.
Public health experts agree that agencies at all levels of government should urgently prepare for the daunting and complex effort to vaccinate hundreds of millions of Americans.
Critics, such as Arizona-based epidemiologist Saskia Popescu, calls the timeline ""deeply worrisome"" adding ""It's hard not to see this as a push for a pre-election vaccine.""

The publication offers further detail on the previously announced NVXâCoV2373 resultsÂ with and without the Matrix-M adjuvant.
After randomization, 83 participants were assigned to receive the vaccine with adjuvant and 25 without adjuvant, and 23 participants were assigned to receive placebo.
The addition of adjuvant resulted in enhanced immune responses, was antigen doseâsparing, and induced a T helper 1 (Th1) response. The two-dose 5-Î¼g adjuvanted regimen induced geometric mean anti-spike IgG (63,160 ELISA units) and neutralization (3906) responses that exceeded geometric mean responses in convalescent sera from mostly symptomatic COVID-19 patients (8344 and 983, respectively).
No serious adverse events were noted. Reactogenicity was absent or mild in the majority of participants, more common with adjuvant, and of short duration (mean, â¤2 days).
NVX-CoV2373 appeared to be safe, and it elicited immune responses that exceeded levels in COVID-19 convalescent serum.
The Matrix-M1 adjuvant induced CD4+ T-cell responses that were biased toward a Th1 phenotype.       NVX-CoV2373 is currently in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials.  The trial was supported by funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

2020-09-12,AZN,AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine study saga reflects risks in race to finish line,"The recent (possible) safety signal-prompted hiccup in AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN) large-scale pivotal study of COVID-19 vaccine candidate AZD1222 exemplifies the risky nature of these types of trials, especially the ones involving vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection considering the profound global need and intense investor scrutiny. Every unexpected event, no matter how insignificant, will be guaranteed a full vetting in this environment.
On September 8, shares dropped overÂ 8%Â after hours (a shining example of off-hours volatility) in the U.S. in reaction to the news that the company voluntarily stopped the trial after a UK patient fell ill after inoculation, an appropriate and expected action to a commonly encountered event, especially in a study involving 30K people. Investors apparently agreed. Shares in the U.S. ended the day upÂ 2%Â from the close of $53.58 on Friday, September 4. Shares in London were upÂ 0.8%Â from the day before.
The next day, reports came out that the participant experienced serious neurological symptoms, later reported as transverse myelitis, an inflammatory condition of the spinal cord, quickly disabused by the company, explaining that no final diagnosis had been made since some test results were pending.
Yesterday, AZN chief Pascal Soriot reiterated that he was unsure on the specific length of the study pause but the company still plans to have a dataset to support a regulatory filing and the vaccine ready by year-end.
Even if the independent safety committee determines that the patient's condition was caused by the vaccine, the study will resume.

On September 6, the standard review process ""triggered a voluntary pause to vaccination"" across all global trials to allow review of safety data by independent committees, and international regulators.
AstraZenecaÂ said it received confirmation from the U.K.âs Medicines Health Regulatory Authority that it was safe to resume clinical trials.
âThe Company will continue to work with health authorities across the world and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume to provide the vaccine broadly, equitably and at no profit during this pandemic,â AZNÂ said in a statement.
The University said that some 18,000 people have so far received the vaccination in trials. In large trials âit is expected that some participants will become unwell and every case must be carefully evaluated to ensure careful assessment of safety,â it added.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca study had been previously stopped in July after a participant developed neurological symptoms, but the illness was found to be unrelated to the experimental vaccine.
Two other vaccines are in huge, final-stage tests in the U.S., one by Moderna (MRNA) and the other by Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX).

The results were presented virtually at ESMO.
The estimated four-year overall survival (OS) rate was 49.6% in the Imfinzi group, compared to 36.3% in the control group after CRT. Median OS was much greater in Imfinzi-treated patients, 47.5 months versus 29.1 months. With a maximum treatment course of one year, ~35.3% patients receiving Imfinzi had not progressed after four years, compared to 19.5% for placebo.
The results build on data published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2018.
Exploratory subgroup analyses from another Phase 3, CASPIAN, evaluating Imfinzi + chemo in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC), showed that more than 3x (17% vs. 4.5%) were alive and progression-free for a year or more compared to chemo alone.

2020-09-21,AZN,AstraZeneca Tagrisso reduces disease recurrence in brain or death by 82% in lung cancer,"Results from a prespecified exploratory analysis of the positive ADAURA Phase III trial showed AstraZenecaâs (NASDAQ:AZN) TAGRISSOÂ (osimertinib) demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in central nervous system (CNS) disease-free survival (DFS) in the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage (IB, II and IIIA) epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), after complete tumor resection.   This analysis showed that fewer patients treated with TAGRISSO in the adjuvant setting had recurrence events or deaths compared to placebo (11% versus 46%).
Among patients whose cancer recurred, 38% of those treated with TAGRISSO had a metastatic recurrence compared to 61% of patients on placebo.
TAGRISSO showed an 82% reduction in the risk of CNS recurrence or death (based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.33; p<0.0001). Median CNS DFS was not yet reached in either arm.
In a post-hoc analysis, the estimated probability of observing disease recurrence in the brain at 18 months for patients treated with TAGRISSO was less than 1% versus 9% for placebo.
On the primary endpoint of DFS in patients with Stage II and IIIA disease, TAGRISSOâ¯in the adjuvant setting reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 83% (HR 0.17; 95% CI 0.12-0.23; p<0.0001).  The safety and tolerability of TAGRISSO in this trial was consistent with previous trials in the metastatic EGFRm NSCLC setting. Adverse events at Grade 3 or higher from all causes occurred in 10% of patients in the TAGRISSO arm versus 3% in the placebo arm as assessed by investigators.

Patients had progressed on prior treatment with new hormonal agent (NHA) treatments (i.e., enzalutamide and abiraterone). OS data cut-off date was March 20, 2020.  In the key secondary endpoint of OS, LYNPARZA reduced the risk of death in patients with BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM mutations by 31% versus enzalutamide or abiraterone (based on a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.97; p=0.0175).
Median OS was 19.1 months for LYNPARZA versus 14.7 months for enzalutamide or abiraterone, despite 66% of men on NHA treatments had crossed over to receive treatment with LYNPARZA following disease progression.
An exploratory analysis also showed a non-statistically significant improvement in OS in the overall trial population of men with HRR gene mutations (BRCA1/2, ATM, CDK12 and 11 other HRRm genes), reducing the risk of death by 21% with LYNPARZA versus enzalutamide or abiraterone (based on a HR of 0.79; 95% CI 0.61-1.03).
Median OS was 17.3 months versus 14.0 months for enzalutamide or abiraterone.  Final OS results from the PROfound trial were presented at the ESMO 2020 and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The government-funded studies should launch in January 2021 at a 24-bed secure quarantine facility in east London.
About 2,000 potential U.K. volunteers have signed up through an advocacy group called 1Day Sooner which campaigns for COVID-19 infection trials aimed at accelerating development which are most useful when the viral infection rate is low. About 37K people globally have enlisted.
The group is launching a campaign this week to petition parliament for funds for a biocontainment facility with sufficient capacity to quarantine up to 200 people.
Volunteers will receive up to Â£3,750 for participating but may earn more considering the length of isolation, potentially as long as a month.
One key aspect of the studies is to select and purify a strain of the coronavirus that generally represents the SARS-CoV-2 strain currently circulating in the overall population.
Also, investigators will have a rescue remedy on hand to prevent serious illness in subjects. The London trial will initially use Gilead Sciences' (GILD

2020-09-25,AZN,FDA issues final rule for importation of drugs from abroad,"Following through on President Trump's Executive Order in July aimed at cutting U.S. drug costs via importation, the FDA issues its final rule on allowing agency-authorized programs to import medicines, including biologics, from Canada under certain conditions that ensure safety.
The guidance describes procedures drug makers can follow, including obtaining a National Drug Code (NDC), to facilitate the importation of prescription drugs and biologics that are FDA-approved, manufactured abroad, authorized for sale in any foreign country and originally intended for sale in that foreign country.
The rule allows states (including the District of Columbia and territories), Indian tribes and - in certain future circumstances - pharmacists and wholesalers, to submit importation program proposals to the FDA for review and authorization. An importation program can be co-sponsored by a state, Indian tribe, pharmacist or wholesaler. Referred to as Section 804 Importation Programs, these programs will be managed by the respective sponsor and any co-sponsors and authorized by the FDA to facilitate the importation of certain prescription drugs that are approved in Canada and, with appropriate labeling, meet the conditions of an FDA-approved drug application. Eligible prescription drugs would have to be relabeled with the required U.S. labeling and undergo testing for authenticity, degradation and to ensure that the drugs meet established specifications and standards. These programs will also have to demonstrate significant cost reductions of the covered products to the American consumer.
FDA Commission Stephen Hahn, M.D., says, ""Today's action is an important part of the FDA's priorities to promote choice and competition. The Safe Importation Action Plan aims to clearly describe procedures to import drugs that would lower prices and improve access while also maintaining the high quality and safety Americans expect and deserve. The FDA will continue to assess and act on opportunities to increase competition in the prescription drug market and help reduce the cost of medicines.""

2020-09-25,AZN,Vaccine news roundup - Cuomo sets up panel for separate NY review,"Dr. Anthony Fauci took to Facebook Live on Thursday to assuage increasing concerns about a politicized approval process for a potential coronavirus vaccine.
""People are always saying, 'How do I know itâs safe? How do I know it's effective? There's a lot of confusion because there are mixed messages that are coming,"" he declared. With every vaccine trial, there is an independent group of scientists, vaccinologists, ethicists and statisticians - known as a data and safety monitoring board - that has exclusive access to the data from a vaccine's clinical trial. If a vaccine proves safe and effective, the company can then seek approval from the FDA and the data will eventually become publicly available.
""We already know that a certain percentage of the population we still need to convince to get vaccinated,"" Fauci continued. ""When a vaccine comes, we look at it as an important tool to supplement the public health measures that we do. It allows us to more quickly and with less stringency get back to some degree of normal.""
""The people of this country don't trust this federal government with this vaccine process,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo later said in a press briefing, saying his state would set up its own independent task force to approve a COVID-19 vaccine.
President Trump related earlier that the White House may overrule stricter FDA guidelines for emergency-use authorization of a vaccine, while HHS Secretary Alex Azar revealed all six frontrunning vaccines were being produced at an industrial scale.
Over in Europe, AstraZeneca (AZN) received partial immunity in a low-cost EU vaccine deal, while in return for a higher price paid for its vaccine, Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) - which is working with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) - did not get any liability waivers.

The review committee will be evaluating the first batch of nonclinical data from lab studies so it is premature to expect a conclusion on safety and effectiveness.
A rolling review is way of accelerating the process. The FDA uses the same approach for high priority medicines and vaccines.

2020-10-01,AZN,FDA widens inquiry into safety of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine,"Reuters reports that the FDA has broadened its investigation into a serious illness in a U.K. participant in a clinical trial evaluating AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine candidate AZD1222. Just to be thorough, the agency will examine data on similar vaccines developed by the same scientists to see if similar side effects emerged from other studies testing vaccines that also utilize modified adenovirus vectors.
The company's late-stage study in the U.S. has been on hold since September 6 after the person fell ill with a rare spinal inflammatory disorder after inoculation.
Reuters reviewed six research papers detailing safety data on vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus, ChAdOx1, for diseases like tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza. Only one serious adverse event was reported, deemed unrelated to the vaccine.
Regulators in the U.K., Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed studies to resume in their respective locations.
An independent data monitoring committee will conduct its first review of preliminary safety and immunogenicity results on AZD1222 after 75 participants have contracted COVID-19 (referred to as events), up from the original plan of 40 events. If the vaccine is safe and highly effective, the committee may recommend an early termination of the trial.

The U.S. study has yet to resume.",0.020713599398732185,0.9270672798156738,0.052219144999980927
2020-10-03,AZN,Low infection rates could extend data readouts in large-scale COVID-19 trials,"Falling COVID-19 infection rates, especially among adults at least 55 years old, are good news/bad news for public health and vaccine developers. The negative implications of higher infection rates are self-evident for the overall population but are a narrowly defined positive for vaccine makers considering the shorter amount of time to accumulate enough events, i.e., cases of post-dose infections, to gauge efficacy. Lower infection rates are clearly preferred, again for obvious reasons, but extend the timeline in a vaccine trial since event accrual is slower. This is a major reason that late-stage vaccine trials recruit tens of thousands of participants. Event accrual is the tollgate for assessing efficacy, even preliminarily.
Assuming the FDA's stated 50% minimum efficacy bar, Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Phase 3 trial, ENSEMBLE, evaluating Ad26.COV2.S in 60K adults will require a minimum of 154 events. Likewise, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech's (NASDAQ:BNTX)
44K-subject study of BNT162b2 will need 164 events (52% efficacy), AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ:AZN) 30K-subject study of AZD1222 will need 150 and Moderna's (NASDAQ:MRNA)
30K-subject trial of mRNA-1273 will need 151.
Vaccine efficacy (VE) is calculated as: VE = 100 x (1 - IRR). IRR, the infection rate ratio, is the rate of confirmed COVID-19 infections in the vaccinated group divided by the rate of infections in the placebo group.Â  For example, if the infection rate in the test group was 0.1% compared to 1.0% in the control group, vaccine efficacy would be 90% [100 x (1 - (0.1%/1.0%)].
A potential emergency use nod in the U.S. based on an interim analysis of less data will likely need a higher efficacy bar before a developer would proceed with an application considering the current public mood about rushing the vaccines to market without thorough vetting since there is no way to truncate the time required to thoroughly assess medium- and long-term safety and efficacy.
J&J's study, launched last week, assumes 60% vaccine efficacy and a 1.4% infection rate in the placebo group during the first three months, dropping to 0.7% in month four and ~0.5% thereafter. Monitoring can start after half of the participants have at least two months' follow-up from the second shot, at least six cases of COVID-19 have been reported in subjects at least 60 years old and at least 20 moderate-to-severe/critical COVID-19 cases have occurred (at least five deemed severe/critical) (protocol, page 110). No interim analyses or efficacy monitoring will be done until these conditions are met. Monitoring for efficacy will be done at least once/week by independent committee until 154 events have been reported or the efficacy (statistical) boundaries have been met.
The minimum number of events in Pfizer/BioNTech'sÂ study is also based on an assumed VE of 60%. 164 events will provide 90% power (statistical threshold) to demonstrate efficacy and an early end to the study (protocol, page 92). This would be achieved with 17,600 evaluable subjects in each arm or 21,999 vaccine recipients randomized 1:1 with placebo for a total sample size of 43,998 based on a 1.3% infection rate in the placebo group. As of September 28, enrollment was 35,469 including 24,289 participants who have received the second shot.
Likewise, Moderna is basing the 151 events in its Phase 3 trial on an assumed VE of 60% (90% power) and a 0.75% six-month infection rate in the control arm (protocol, page 13). There are two interim analyses planned, after 35% and 70%, respectively, of the total targeted cases have been observed. As of September 25, 27,232 people have been enrolled including 15,454 who have received the second jab.
All things considered, the chance of a U.S. emergency use nod before election day appears remote, but possible before year-end.",0.057552214711904526,0.8901233375072479,0.0523244496434927

2020-10-12,AZN,Head of Operation Warp Speed sees emergency authorization vaccine request around Thanksgiving,"The head of the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed program, Moncef Slaoui, expects drugmakers to file with the FDA for emergency authorization of a coronavirus vaccine by late November.
The project aims to deliver 300M doses of a vaccine starting in January, though none of the four vaccine candidates to enter Phase 3 trials have yet publicly reported data from the mid-stage studies.
""My expectation is really something between 80% and 90% efficacy,"" he added, saying immunization in high-risk populations could begin this year.
""Between November and January, we will have enough vaccines to immunize, I would say, 80M to 100M people, which represents all the elderly people, the health care workers, the first line workers. After that, we start to immunize the less risky populations. If you look at it over a period of six, seven months, between November and June, we will be immunizing a very large number of people, month on month, every month, starting with the most risky, the most impacted toward the least impacted people.""
""I'm disappointed that politicians have embarked into communication processes and media in a way that has created so much angst around this process. We're forgetting something, which is people are dying, and forgetting another thing, which is never ever before has an effort of this proportion been made and vaccines been developed in a period of less than a year. We're not running smaller trials; we're running bigger trials than usual. I hope this never happens again, that such events are politicized. Transparency, transparency, transparency is the name of the game. We are committed to make available every data.""

Prior to the trial halt, the vaccine had been one of the furthest along in development, and was perhaps on track for approval by year-end.
It was reported earlier this week that AZN's trial (as well as J&J's) was on track to get the go-ahead to resume.",0.03277450427412987,0.9184818863868713,0.04874362796545029

2020-10-23,AZN,FDA getting cold feet on EUA nod for COVID-19 vaccines,"STAT New reportsÂ that that FDA appears to be losing some enthusiasm for issuing emergency use authorizations (EUA) for COVID-19 vaccines that would open the floodgates to widespread deployment.
Recent surveys have shown that a large portion of Americans would be reticent about vaccination over concerns that the vaccines have been rushed through the clinical trial and review processes without thorough vetting for safety.
Instead, the agency is apparently mulling an expanded access approach, a more limited program typically used for investigational drugs in areas of high unmet need, in the early stage of rollouts.
During yesterday's FDA advisory committee meeting on COVID-19 vaccine approval criteria, Marion Gruber, director of the FDA's Office of Vaccine Research and Review, said,Â âWe are concerned about the risk that the use of a vaccine under an EUA  would interfere with long-term assessment of safety and efficacy in  ongoing trials and potentially even jeopardize product approval. And not only the first vaccine, but maybe even follow-on  vaccines.â
University of Michigan's Arnold Monto added that the maker of a COVID-19 vaccine that nabs an EUA nod might not be able to generate enough additional data to support full licensure.
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE

2020-10-28,AZN,"U.S. COVID-19 cases on the rise, key vaccine data expected in November","36 U.S. states reported at least 5% more COVID-19 hospitalizations over the past week. Yesterday, 73,240 new cases were reported, raising the seven-day average to 71,832, up 20% from a week ago and a new record, although the vast majority of cases are mild or moderate and driven, at least in part, by increased availability of testing.
In an interview on NBC's TODAY show, Assistant Secretary of Health Adm. Brett Giroir said hospitalizations, while significantly below levels seen at the height of the pandemic, are rising, adding that ""we can control the virus"" by following public health measures like social distancing, mask wearing, avoiding crowded gatherings and frequently washing hands.

Mortality in the NYU system in New York was 7.6% in August compared to 25.6% in March, adjusted for demographic and clinical factors.
Many experts believe the pandemic will worsen in the fall and winter as the weather turns colder forcing people indoors.
Europe is grappling with a second wave of infections after many countries eased restrictions, although fatality rates remain relatively low. In the U.K., for example, the rate is about 0.75%, up from the low of 0.50% in August but significantly below ~3% in June.
On the vaccine front, preliminary data on Pfizer (PFE
-4.5%) and BioNTech's (BNTX
-7.5%) BNT162b2 are now expected next month due to lower infection rates in the control arm which extends the timeline for the minimum number of events to gauge efficacy. Moderna (MRNA

2020-10-31,AZN,"Vaccine developers take varied approaches to COVID-19, next-gen platforms may not be better than more traditional technologies","As data readouts and expected regulatory nods approach for COVID-19 vaccines, a review of the platform technologies may be a timely refresher for healthcare investors since the next-generation approaches have yet to be approved for any use anywhere in the world and may not top the effectiveness of more traditional methods.
Production scale-ups are well underway for rapid deployment, expected to begin in early 2021.
Leading vaccine makers have inked supply deals in most major markets, led by the U.S.'s $18B Operation Warp Speed aimed at delivering 300M doses by January viaÂ supporting the development of eight candidates in parallel.
Six of the eight vaccines are currently in clinical trials, while two will enter studies soon.

Traditional vaccines rely on a live-attenuated (weakened) virus [e.g., measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), rotavirus, smallpox, chickenpox, yellow fever] or whole-inactivated (killed) virus (e.g., hepatitis B, HPV, whooping cough, pneumonia, meningitis, shingles) to produce the desired immune response. The negatives include the potential to cause the disease it is designed to prevent (live-attenuated versions) and the need to deal with live virus in the development process.
In COVID-19's case, researchers did not need the live virus since Chinese scientists sequenced the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and published the results online in January. Based on previous research on cousins SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, investigators knew to focus their attention of the coronavirus' spike protein that studs its surface and enables it to enter healthy human cells. Vaccines that expose the body to the spike protein alone, which is the antigen, should induce a protective immune response. This is the strategy behind most of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates.
Moderna's (NASDAQ:MRNA) mRNA-1273 and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)/BioNTech's (NASDAQ:BNTX) BNT162b2 are genetic vaccines which use messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct the person's cells to make the spike protein which, in turn, activates the immune response. Since mRNA is a fragile rapidly degraded molecule that does not easily pass through the cell membrane, both candidates use carrier molecules called lipid nanoparticles to transport it into the cytoplasm of the cell.
Other vaccines use a different (benign) virus, called a vector, to carry the spike protein coding sequence into cells. These are categorized as replication-defective (RD) or replication-competent (RC). The most popular RD choice for COVID-19 vaccines is adenoviruses, used in Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Ad26.COV2.SÂ  and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) (AZD1222) and Oxford University's candidate (ChAdOx1). The former uses human adenovirus 26 (Ad26) as the vector, while the latter uses a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd). In both vaccines, the adenovirus carries DNA coding for the spike protein into the nucleus of the host cell where its machinery produces the spike protein. Since the viral vector is replication-defective, no more viruses are produced after the first cell is infected.
Merck's (NYSE:MRK) candidate V590 uses a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vector, while V591 uses the measles virus (Q3 earnings call presentation, slide #6). Wild-type VSV is usually asymptomatic or causes mild flu-like illness in humans. Company scientists replaced part of its RNA sequence with RNA coding for the spike. Unlike adenoviruses, this rVSV vector displays the spike on its surface. Since it is replication-competent, it more closely resembles a real viral attack. This is the same platform the company uses in its Ebola vaccine, Ervebo, approved by the FDA in December 2019 - the first and only viral vector vaccine to earn a U.S. nod to date.
Novavax's (NASDAQ:NVAX) NVX-CoV2373 is a stable prefusion protein based on its recombinant protein nanoparticle technology (uses a subunit of the spike protein) that includes its proprietary Matrix-M adjuvant. One of its advantages is that it is stable at cool temperatures (~36 - 46 degrees Fahrenheit), enabling distribution through standard vaccine channels.
The FDA has yet to approve any adenovirus vector vaccine or DNA or mRNA vaccine.
Data readouts from late-stage studies on Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech's candidates should happen in the coming weeks.

2020-11-12,AZN,"Amid cold-storage hurdle, Sanofi and J&J may beat logistical challenges","Pfizer this week reported stellar early results from its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial, but the stringent storage needs poses challenges to a global vaccination campaign.Â The first-generation form must be stored frozen at negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit, most likely needing dry ice (-109 degrees Fahrenheit) for shipment.
If clinically proven, later-arriving shots from the likes of Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)
may be better suited for global distribution.
J&J's vaccine is in testing as a one and two dose regimen, for instance, and is expected to be stable at refrigerated temperatures of 35.6 - 46.4Â° degrees Fahrenheit.
During the launch of its Phase 3 trial in September, the company said the candidate is ""compatible with standard vaccine distribution channels and would not require new infrastructure to get it to the people who need it.""
With Janssen's AdVac technology, the vaccine, if successful, is estimated to remain stable for two years at -20 Â°C and at least three months at 2-8Â° C.
Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK) program, a two-dose recombinant protein vaccine with an adjuvant, can be stored between 35.6 - 46.4Â° Fahrenheit, or in a doctorâs office or pharmacy, a spokeswoman said.
SNY is also advancing an mRNA program with Translate Bio; the shot which must be stored at an even colder 112Â° below zero Fahrenheit. But a spokeswoman said the team is âworking on improving the stability of the mRNA vaccine candidate,â and is targeting a storage temperature of -4Â° Fahrenheit.
Modernaâs (NASDAQ:MRNA) shot, another late-stage mRNA program, must be stored at -4Â° Fahrenheit.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) is conducting stability and shipping studies to determine requirements for its vaccine, a spokesman said. The company expects final multi-dose vials ""will require refrigeration to ensure product quality, which will involve a reliable, flexible cold chain during transport,"" he added.
Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is also weighing several options for an improved vaccine that could help resolve storage concerns. ""For the COVID-19 disease, I think we'll roll out next year a vaccine in powder format,"" told Pfizer's Chief Scientist, Mikael Dolsten to Business Insider.

2020-11-17,AZN,Is messenger RNA technology in COVID-19 a new tool to success?,"Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) on Monday, reported encouraging preliminary results from its mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273. The result comes a week after Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) revealed a protection rate of more than 90% against disease.
Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, both use the same promising messenger RNA technology, and their combined excellent early results suggest the world has a crucial new tool to respond quickly to diseases.

The mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine, once injected instructs the bodyâs cells to create copies of the coronavirus protein. In turn, this is expected to prompt the immune cells to create antibodies to fight it.
These antibodies will remain in the blood and fight the real virus if and when it infects the human body. They essentially turn cells into tiny drug factories.
In addition to being speedier to manufacture and develop, a feature which helped Pfizer and Moderna quickly start clinical trials â mRNA is well-suited to rapid adaptation.
But, messenger RNA is also delicate, requiring careful cold storage and handling that will complicate distribution, though Modernaâs shot is easier to handle than Pfizerâs. 

Vaccines using mRNA are the front-runners in the race, but many other inoculations are in development.
CureVac (NASDAQ:CVAC) also reported encouraging results from preclinical studies evaluating its mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CVnCoV, in mice and hamsters.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) / Oxford and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) both use modified viruses to carry genetic material that prompts an immune response. They are likely to be the next to reveal data from continuing trials.
The genetically modified adenovirus cannot replicate in humans, enters the cell and release the code to make only the spike protein. It's another approach that's quick and adaptable.
Merck's (NYSE:MRK) candidate V590 uses a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vector, while V591 uses the measles virus. Unlike adenoviruses, this rVSV vector displays the spike on its surface.
The older approaches used by Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) may be slower and have yet to enter the final stage of testing in the U.S., but they can build up supplies quickly once up and running.
Other types of vaccine include the non-replicating viral vector category, often effective but time-consuming.
Then there are inactivated virus vaccines made by using particles of the COVID-19 virus that were killed, making them unable to infect or replicate; protein subunit vaccines to build a targeted immune response and DNA vaccines that use genetically engineered DNA molecules.
Moderna shares have surged around 47% over the past six months on optimism about its COVID-19 vaccine.

All of them have reported positive data on their vaccine safety and efficacy, raising hopes of availability of a potential safe COVID-19 vaccine by end of December or January next year.


Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine also showed a strong immune response in older adults in Phase-2 clinical. Findings from the final stage of AZN's vaccine studies are due to be released shortly.
While wealthy nations are targeting first supplies of the Pfizer and Moderna shots, many other regions are depending heavily on the following front-runners, especially AstraZeneca, Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
Oxford-AstraZeneca shots accounts for more than 40% of the supplies going to lower and middle-income nations, based on deals tracked by London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine costs a fraction of Pfizer vaccine and will be manufactured in multiple countries, from India to Brazil. It should be easier to deploy far and wide than other shots that need to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures.
AstraZeneca has earlier said it wonât profit during the pandemic and that the vaccine will cost between $4 and $5 a dose compared to the Pfizer/BioNTech shot priced at $19.50 a dose, or $39 for a two-shot immunization.
Moderna intends to charge $32 to $37 a dose for smaller deals and less for bigger purchases.
âThereâs a lot riding on the Astra vaccine,â said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. For lower-income countries, âitâs huge.â
Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine also has advantages beyond cost. Their product is said to be easier to transport and store.
The vaccine can be kept at refrigerator temperatures, while those from PFE and MRNA, require freezing for longer-term storage and transport.
AstraZeneca has reached an agreement to supply the initiative, while a collaboration including the Serum Institute of India agreed to accelerate the production of Astra or Novavax shots for low and middle-income countries.
If approved by the U.K. government, Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine may get emergency use authorization (EUA) in India.

One regimen, given to some 2,700 people, showed an effectiveness of 90% when trial participants received a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart. The other dosing regimen, given to nearly 9,000 people, showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens found average vaccine effectiveness of 70%.

Despite the lower efficacy, the British shot has some distribution advantages. While vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have to be stored frozen, the Astra-Oxford jab can be kept at refrigerator temperature and comes at a potentially lower cost.
AstraZeneca also said there were no serious adverse safety events and the vaccine was tolerated well across both dosing groups. Late-stage clinical trials of the vaccine are continuing in the U.S. following a pause during most of September and October.
""Excitingly, we've found that one of our dosing regimens may be around 90% effective and if this dosing regime is used, more people could be vaccinated with planned vaccine supply,"" said Professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial.

There was no age breakdown given for the two groups from AstraZeneca when the company reported its results on Monday; Slaoui says the initial half-dose was used in some people because of an error in the quantity of vaccine put into some vials.
""Approval based on current data means people [would] be inoculated with a vaccine the true efficacy of which is unknown,"" says Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Sam Fazeli, who believes another trial is needed to assess the Astra vaccine's efficacy and that the current data also raises concerns on Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ

2020-11-27,AZN,AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine may get U.K. approval before EU,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has asked the U.K. medical regulator to potentially bypass its European Union (EU) counterpart and approve the supply of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and the University's COVID-19 vaccine to speed its deployment, Bloomberg reports.
Until the end of the year, when the U.K. exits a post-Brexit transition period, vaccines there must be authorized by the EMA.

On Friday, Hancock invoked a special rule allowing Britainâs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to authorize a temporary supply of AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine if the data is robust enough.
âWe have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards,â Hancock said in a statement.
By speeding up the approval process, the U.K. hopes to be able to begin its mass vaccination program next month.
Hancockâs action will also make a political point with the U.K., that Brexit will enable the government to act quickly in Britain's favor outside of the blocâs bureaucracy.
Earlier this week, AZN's COVID-19 vaccine showed an average efficacy of 70%. However, several scientists have raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90% effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose.
âIâm not going to pretend itâs not an interesting result, because it isâbut I definitely donât understand it and I donât think any of us do,â said Mene Pangalos, AstraZenecaâs executive vice president for biopharmaceuticals R&D. âIt was surprising to us.â
AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford are defending the results and methods used in their Phase 3 vaccine trials on the back of criticism, stressing the âhighest standardsâ were used and that âadditional analysis will be conducted.â
U.S. regulators have set the bar for authorizing vaccines at 50% effectiveness, but vaccines in development by Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and partners Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Germanyâs BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) have set the benchmark even higher with study results showing greater than 90% effectiveness.
Those vaccines use a new gene-based technology that, despite its impressive clinical results thus far, requires the shots to be stored at subzero temperatures, whereas AstraZenecaâs vaccine can be stored in a more standard refrigerator, making it attractive to low and middle-income nations.
Oxford researchers have said that the lower dose may have been more effective because it more accurately reflects the natural immune response to viruses, but that they would have to investigate the findings further to know for sure.
AstraZeneca is likely to conduct an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine, after current studies raised questions over its level of protection.

Crestor, which brought in revenue of over $5B for AstraZeneca in 2015, was among its best-selling medicines and used to contribute to ~20% of the company's total revenue. But Crestor was hit by the arrival of cheap generic rivals in 2016 and newer medicines such as Tagrisso, Imfinzi and Fasenra were promoted by AstraZeneca as drugs that would take over.

AstraZeneca will continue to manufacture and supply the drug to GrÃ¼nenthal during a transition period and will continue to sell it in other regions, including North America and China

2020-12-08,AZN,U.K. rolls out COVID-19 vaccine to public - report,"British health authorities have begun rolling out the first doses of a widely tested and reviewed COVID-19 vaccine, starting a global immunization program, reports The Washington Post.
The first shot came on Tuesday morning at one of a network of hospital hubs where the initial phase of the U.K. program will be rolled out on what has been dubbed âV-Day.â

The first recipient was grandmother Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week. She received the shot at University Hospital Coventry at 6:31 a.m. (U.K. time, 07.31 CET). Among those older Britons scheduled to get vaccinated is Hari Shukla, of Newcastle.
The first 800,000 doses are going to people over 80 who are either hospitalised or already have outpatient appointments scheduled, along with nursing home workers.
Most of the people will have to wait until next year to be dosed as at present only those who are most at risk will be vaccinated.
The U.K. is getting a head start on the project after British regulators on Dec. 2 gave emergency nod to the vaccine developed by Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Germanyâs BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX).
U.S. and European Union authorities are also reviewing the vaccine, alongside rival products developed by Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and a collaboration between Oxford University and drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
The first shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were delivered to a selected group of U.K. hospitals on Sunday.
In England, the vaccine will be delivered at 50 hospital hubs in the first wave of the program. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are making their own plans under the U.K.âs system of devolved administration.

+0.9%) COVID-19 vaccine candidate is safe and effective, giving good protection, researchers have confirmed in The Lancet journal. Though most in the study were younger than 55, but the results so far indicate it does work well in older people too.

Because older adults were recruited to the studies later than younger ones, âtheyâve had less time for cases to accrue in those age groups and for us to be able to measure an efficacy signal,â said Andrew Pollard, lead investigator on the Oxford trial. âThe evidence we have so far on the immune response very much suggests that itâs likely to be similar levels of protection across the ages.â

Interim results announced almost a fortnight ago, showed three efficacy levels for the vaccine - an overall effectiveness of 70%, a lower one of 62% and a high of 90%. That's because different doses of the vaccine were used in one part of the trial. The Lancet report reveals 1,367 people received the half dose followed by a full dose, which gave them 90% protection against the infection.
In terms of safety, there was one severe adverse event potentially related to the vaccine and another one - a high temperature that is still being investigated. Both these participants are recovering and are still in the trial.
The study also measured protection against asymptomatic infection by asking volunteers to do regular swabs to check if they had Covid without feeling unwell. More of infection cases were seen in the group that did not receive the vaccine.
While the Astra-Oxford shot looks to be less effective than those of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, itâs expected to be cheaper and easier to store & distribute.

The vaccine has already been administered to hundreds of thousands of people under emergency authorization in China, but it's yet to receive public use approval from any drug regulators.

2020-12-09,AZN,"U.S. banks on J&J, AstraZeneca for vaccine delivery, inoculation expected by mid 2021 - Bloomberg","The U.S. governmentâs plan to vaccinate citizens by next summer depends heavily on two COVID-19 shots which are not expected until early in 2021, source Bloomberg.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) together would provide 150M to 200M shots in Q1 2021 which could immunize 110M to 150M people, if the doses are evenly split, said Moncef Slaoui, Chief Scientific officer of Operation Warp Speed.

That is in addition to Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and collaborater BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) vacines, from whom the U.S. has ordered enough doses for 100M people combined.
In earlier negotiations with the U.S., Pfizer didnât guarantee that it would be able to deliver an additional 100M doses in a specified time frame, according to a White House official. The parties remain in talks about the U.S. exercising an option to purchase additional doses.
Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA chief who's now on Pfizerâs board, said Tuesday on CNBC that the offer remained on the table even after Pfizer data showing high vaccine efficacy.
Eventually, other countries surpassed U.S., and now Pfizerâs home nation would have to wait until late summer to get more doses.
Therefore with more Pfizer doses unavailable for the short run, the U.S. needs AstraZeneca and J&J to present data to the FDA that shows their vaccines are effective and safe.
Slaoui expects interim data from the J&J trial in early January, though J&J executives expect to report such data towards the month end.
Warp Speedâs chief scientist added at the White House event that he anticipates J&Jâs shot will get a green-light from U.S. regulators in late January or early February.
Meanwhile, AstraZeneca-Oxfordâs jab wonât read out until late-January or early-February, with the potential for an emergency-use authorization coming toward the end of February or early March, according to Slaoui.
The U.S. has reached a deal for 300M doses of the Astra-Oxford vaccine.
A third group of vaccines, one by Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) and the other by Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), could be authorized in the spring for use in April or May, he said. âThose can also produce hundreds of millions of doses,â Slaoui said.
Additionally, the U.S. still has an an additional option for supply from Moderna, whose vaccine is awaiting FDA authorization later this month.
Modernaâs original supply agreement with the U.S. for 100M doses allows for the government to order 400M more, according to Moderna spokesman Ray Jordan. A price of $16.50 per dose has already been agreed upon.",0.05176117643713951,0.9125009775161743,0.03573782369494438

2020-12-12,AZN,AstraZeneca to acquire Alexion bulking up rare disease portfolio,"Big pharmaâs pivot to rare diseases continues as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) acquires Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN) in a deal worth $39B.
Subject to shareholder approval and certain regulatory clearances, the companies expect the deal to close in Q3 2021.
The combined company is set to generate ~$500M of recurring run-rate of pre-tax synergies per year with full run-rate expected to be achieved by the end of the third year, following the closure of the acquisition.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Alexion shareholders will receive $60 in cash and 2.1243 new AstraZeneca ADSs listed on the Nasdaq exchange for each of their Alexion shares. The consideration amounts to ~45% of premium to Alexionâs closing share price on Friday. AstraZeneca has entered into a bridge-financing facility to finance the deal.
The duo will work together to build on âAlexion's pipeline of 11 molecules across more than 20 clinical-development programs across the spectrum of indications, in rare diseases and beyondâ, a joint statement from the two companies said.
With projections suggesting a low double-digit percentage of growth for the global market for rare diseases, Alexionâs specialty in rare and ultra-rare disease care has gained industry attention. Of over 7,000 rare diseases, only ~5% have FDA-approved therapies.
Alexionâs portfolio includes Soliris (eculizumab), a first-in-class anti-complement component 5 (C5) monoclonal antibody approved for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome, generalized myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.
In the face of competition, the company has accelerated the conversion of its existing Soliris patient base to Ultomiris (ravulizumab) which has a more convenient dosing regimen. In less than two years, the second-generation C5 monoclonal antibody has achieved over 70% conversion for PNH in the U.S., Germany and Japan, Alexionâs key markets, accounting for two-thirds of its global revenue.
The competitive threats had not slowed down the companyâs top-line growth, reaching ~20.8% YoY growth in 2019, up from ~16.6% YoY growth four years ago. The cash and equivalents stood ~184.5% higher than the level in 2015, while net debt to EBITDA was negligible compared to ~2.6x five years ago.
Yet, Alexion was trading at ~10.0x on a price to NTM earnings basis, less than half of its average over the last five years becoming a prime acquisition target amid activist pressure for a sale.",0.04493901506066322,0.9239150285720825,0.03114600107073784

BioMarin is worthy of particular attention. A cursory look at 2014 â 2019 financials indicates the company had more than a twofold rise in revenue with EBITDA turning positive to $0.5M compared to negative ~$98.8M five years ago.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a televised address, said the first doses are due to arrive later in December, and that other vaccines would also be coming in the months ahead after approval.

His government expects to have 5.7M supplies for everyone in the nation by Q3 2021.
Vaccination will be free and voluntary, and that health care workers and other vulnerable individuals would be prioritized.
Also, Singapore will be moving from Phase 2 to Phase 3 of its reopening from Dec. 28 - allowing gatherings of up to eight people, instead of only five.
Singapore's own Duke-NUS Medical School has also been working with U.S.-based Arcturus Therapeutics on another potential vaccine, which entered clinical trials in August.
Pending approval, his endeavor is expected to yield doses for the city-state's population by the first quarter of next year.
The country has reported a total of 58,325 cases so far, but Lee noted that the virus appears to be largely under control, with zero local transmissions on most days.

But SVB Leerink Charles Song notes âinvestors could demand more from AZN, or another acquirerâ adding âthe final transaction price may need to reach $200 to satisfy Alexion's shareholders, or to be based more in cash, rather than predominantly stock.â",0.03896203264594078,0.9297344088554382,0.03130354359745979

The vaccines are given in two doses several weeks apart. The government has a reserve of 500,000 doses in case any problems arise, he added.
The most urgent U.S. mass immunization campaign in the past was for polio shots, rolled out in the 1950s.
The average number of daily deaths over a seven-day period has grown from 824 on Nov. 1 to over 2,400 as of Sunday, prompting new restrictions by many states in an attempt to curb the spread.
While the first dose of the vaccine was administered in New York, people across the nation began receiving it on Monday as well. Hospitals in many other states, from Alaska to Michigan and Texas to Florida, also received their first vaccine doses Monday.
The vaccinations started after the F.D.A.âs emergency authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last week.
On Sunday, trucks and cargo planes packed with the first of nearly three million doses of coronavirus vaccine had fanned out across the country.
Medical staff have been advised to monitor patients for at least 15 minutes to make sure they donât have adverse reactions. Two people who received the Pfizer vaccine in the U.K. last week had severe allergic reactions.
Only a small percentage of the U.S. population will get access to the shots initially, as early supplies are limited. Pfizer said that 25M doses will be available in the U.S. by the end of the month.

2020-12-22,AZN,Will vaccines work against the U.K. coronavirus variant?,"""We don't know at the moment if our vaccine is also able to provide protection against this new variant,"" but because the proteins on the variant are 99% the same as the prevailing strains, BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) has ""scientific confidenceâ in the vaccine.
""The likelihood that our vaccine works... is relatively high,"" CEO Ugur Sahin declared, saying the company is currently conducting further studies and hopes to have certainty within the coming weeks.
Dr. Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, also expects Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna's (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 shots will be effective against a new mutation of the virus, dubbed B117. The chances one set of mutations would completely alter the structures found around the spike proteins ""are extremely low,"" he declared.
""It stands to reason that this mutation isn't a threat, but you never know. We still have to be diligent and continue to look,"" added Dr. Nelson Michael, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. U.S. army scientists have already started doing a computer analysis on genetic sequences of the new U.K. variant, and if there's additional concern, studies would need to be done in the laboratory and on animals.
World Health Organization officials meanwhile said the coronavirus is mutating ""at a much slower rate"" than seasonal influenza and ""so far, even though we've seen a number of changes and a number of mutations, none has made a significant impact on either the susceptibility of the virus to any of the currently used therapeutics, drugs, or the vaccines under development, and one hopes that that will continue to be the case.""
While many nations have banned travel with countries where the strain has been identified, former FDA chief Dr. Scott Gottlieb doesn't think that's necessary in the U.S., as the strain is ""already"" present in the population. ""We're going to have an epidemic that continues to build over the course of the next three or four weeks, we'll reach a peak, and then we'll start to see infection rates decline as we see vaccinations get rolled out.""

âAZD1222 (AstraZenecaâs vaccine candidate) contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, and the changes to the genetic code seen in this new viral strain do not appear to change the structure of the spike protein,â an AstraZeneca representative said in an email.

âThrough vaccination with AZD1222, the bodyâs immune system is trained to recognize many different parts of the spike protein, so that it can eliminate the virus if it is later exposed,â the AstraZeneca representative added.
The mutation known as the B.1.1.7 lineage is up to 70% more transmissible and has prompted stringent lockdowns in the U.K. and wave of travel bans.
India is likely to approve Oxford-AstraZenecaâs vaccine for emergency use by next week, Reuters says. This could be the first country to give the regulatory green light for the British drugmakerâs vaccine.

2020-12-24,AZN,"Analysts predict M&A poised to rebound in next year, fueled by $1.47T in deal making capital","When AstraZeneca (AZN
-0.6%) announced $39B Alexion acquisition on December 12 soon after the first COVID-19 jab was approved in the U.S., it potentially marked as good a sign as any that M&A activity might be returning in biopharma.
In fact, industry watchers were already predicting that, after down year that was 2020, biopharma deal-making would return to pre-pandemic levels in 2021.

Prior to AZNâs announced deal, there were 242 pharma and life sciences transactions announced in 2020, down 2.3% from the previous year, but overall value of those deals plummeted by 61% to just $141B, PwC reports.
According to PwC figures, 2021 will usher in between $250B-$275B worth of M&A, with several of those as mega-mergers over $50B in size, while others will be smaller âbolt-onâ transactions.
Eli Lilly (LLY
+0.7%) heralded a rise in bolt-on deals when it pledged $1B for Prevail Therapeutics (PRVL
-0.04%), a gene therapy player, a deal that came in just one month after Lilly teamed up with Precision BioSciences (DTIL
-5.3%) in a $135M gene therapy development pact.
Sky Milch, U.S. pharmaceutical and life sciences deals leader at PwC, in an interview estimated that as of December, the biopharma industry had $1.47T in capital that it could deploy against M&A. âThat number is down only 6% over 2019. What that means is that while pharma was creating the resiliency to get through the pandemic, the industry still maintained enough firepower to put towards inorganic growth,â
Signs of an M&A rebound first emerged in September, when Gilead Sciences (GILD
-0.5%) announced it would buy Immunomedics for $21B, and it came in six months after Gilead laid out $5B for Forty Seven in another deal in effort to branch out from its flagship infectious disease franchise.

The Indian regulator is considering similar approvals for Pfizer (PFE)/ BioNTech (BNTX) vaccine as the country expects 600M coronavirus shots in the next 6 â 8 months.

The vaccine from Pfizer/ BioNTech has already been cleared for emergency use in the U.K.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab could be rolled out across Britain from Jan. 4, the Sunday Telegraph reported, adding that ""mass vaccination centres at sports stadiums and conference venues"" could launch as soon as the second week of January.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of U.K. is expected to give the green light before Thursday, The Sunday Times, reported, while the Telegraph said the vaccine will be approved on December 28 or 29.
The AstraZeneca vaccine could facilitate a rapid ramp-up of vaccinations because itâs easier to transport and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.
While the new COVID-19 variant continues to spread across the U.K., AstraZeneca Chief told the Sunday Times that new data will show the vaccine is comparable to the 95% effectiveness rate reported by the rival developers.

2020-12-30,AZN,Ocugen shares get hit as experts slam its COVID-19 vaccine partner,"The small-cap COVID-19 vaccine developer Ocugen (NASDAQ:OCGN) is trading 7.8% lower today on below-average volume as experts raise ethical issues against Bharat Biotech, the company's vaccine partner.
The company announced last week that it has signed a binding letter of intent to co-develop Bharat Biotechâs whole-viron inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate COVAXINâ¢, for the U.S. market.

Driven by the partnership for the COVID-19 vaccine development, the shares of Ocugen have more than doubled in value for the past five-day period, with a more than a sevenfold rise for the past month.
Latest reports from India suggest that Bharat Biotech, in its struggle to recruit 26,000 trial participants for the ongoing Phase 3 trial, has released a document with a FAQ section that has drawn ethical concerns among health experts.
In its pitch to attract volunteers, the document says, âthe investigators should inform potential volunteers that the vaccine would protect them against COVID-19â citing potential delays for a vaccination program for a government-approved shot.
Experts describe it as misguided advice, pointing to the risk faced by those receiving the placebo and therefore would be left unprotected. The editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, Amar Jesani, highlighted the potential impact on trial results. The complacent trial subjects, following the advice, will have a higher likelihood of getting infected with COVID-19, potentially leading to a better overall trial outcome, he explained.
However, Dr, Venkat Rao, the principal investigator of the Institute of Medical Sciences, a trial site said, it was âbetter to get something than nothingâ arguing that at least half of the trial participants would get the vaccine.
A few days after announcing the agreement with Bharat Biotech, Ocugen declared the appointment of an advisory board to evaluate the clinical and regulatory path for COVAXIN in the U.S.

2020-12-30,AZN,U.S. vaccinations far short of 'Warp Speed' target for 2020,"With only two days remaining in 2020, the U.S. will likely fall short of its goal to vaccinate 20M Americans by the year's end.
Operation Warp Speed planned to provide 40M doses (each vaccine requires two shots) between Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE, BNTX) and Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), but according to the latest figures from the CDC, just more than 11.4M doses had been distributed since Dec. 13 and only about 2.1M had been administered (the large variance is partly due to a lag in reporting).

What's going on? COVID-19 vaccine czar, Moncef Slaoui, acknowledged last week that the ramp-up of immunizations ""is slower than we thought it would be,"" while U.S. Army Gen. Gustave Perna, who oversees logistics for Operation Warp Speed, repeatedly apologized after some state officials reported cuts to their allocations. The launch of the federal government's partnership with major pharmacy chains like CVS (NYSE:CVS) and Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), which will be tasked with vaccinating long-term care residents, is also pending.
""I believe that as we get into January, we are going to see an increase in the momentum,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN, adding that he hopes the push will be enough to ""catch up to the projected pace that we had spoken about a month or two ago.""
""The Trump administrationâs plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind, far behind,"" President-elect Joe Biden added at news briefing. He said his administration would ""move heaven and earth"" to accelerate distribution once he takes office on Jan. 20.
The situation is even more imperative after the U.S. confirmed the first case of a new and potentially more infectious strain of COVID-19 recently discovered in U.K. The individual is a male in his 20s, who is currently in isolation in Elbert County, Colorado, but does not have a travel history.

2020-12-30,AZN,Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for emergency use in the U.K.,"The coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has been authorized for emergency use in the U.K., which has ordered 100M doses of the shot (enough to vaccinate 50M people).
The jab is expected to be rolled out next week and would be added to the Pfizer-BioNTech (NYSE:PFE) vaccine that has so far been given to 600,000 people in England.

The approval could also accelerate the lifting of strict lockdowns implemented in parts of the country, according to Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove, which effectively canceled Christmas festivities for millions due a new coronavirus variant.
Confusion initially surrounded trial data of the U.K. vaccine in November, which led to some criticism of AstraZeneca. When people were given a half dose, followed by a full measure at least a month after, there was an efficacy rate of 90%, but that fell to an efficacy of 62% when two full doses were given at least a month apart. When all the results were tabulated from the 11,636 participants, the average efficacy of the vaccine worked out to 70%.
Chief of the White House's Operation Warp Speed, Moncef Slaoui, and others in the U.S. have also expressed concern over the age groups in the trial, saying the 90% efficacy was only shown for the lowest risk group, which numbered 2,741 people below age 55.
The biggest advantages of the AstraZeneca/Oxford jab are price and storage. It does not need to be kept at ultra-low temperatures and will cost about $4 a dose, compared to the $20 per vial from Pfizer and $33 for Moderna's (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccine.
Across the pond, the U.S. is likely to fall short of its Warp Speed target of vaccinating 20M people by the end of 2020.",0.09472499042749405,0.8749299645423889,0.030345069244503975
2020-12-31,AZN,COVID-19 vaccine makers: Looking back on 2020 seeking insights for 2021,"2020 was the year the biotech sector roared back to life. Led by COVID-19 vaccine developers, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) returned 25.7% compared to 16.2% in the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), signaling a remarkable turnaround from 2019 when SPY, with a 28.8% gain, outperformed the 25.0% rise in the IBB. 
With breakthrough technologies, the COVID-19 vaccine pioneers have dominated the year reaching record-breaking market capitalizations as the pandemic wreaked havoc across the globe. 
After languishing with a 25.4% gain in 2019, the vaccine maker Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) has climbed 434.1% in 2020 thanks to its COVID-19 injection, which recently won the FDA authorization for emergency use. The rival, BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), is trailing with a 140.6% gain even though its partnership with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) was the first to secure the emergency use signoff in the U.S. 
The frontrunners in the COVID-19 vaccine race are on track to generate more data readouts as they seek to file for full FDA clearance in 2021. The rival candidates are likely to join them, potentially capping their outsize gains. 
Jefferies has already downgraded Moderna, citing the record stock performance and upcoming Phase 3 data from the likes of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX). Against this backdrop, and amid concerns over a new COVID-19 strain detected in the U.K., both Moderna and BioNTech have shed 17.8% and 25.9%, respectively, in December though they have highlighted the efficacy of their shots against the new variant.
With ~2,694.7% of increase in value, Novavax (NVAX) appears to have more than priced in its achievements against COVID-19 ahead of key late-stage data readouts scheduled for early 2021. Meanwhile, riding on the success of fellow mRNA-based vaccine developers, CureVac has risen 45.0% since its market debut in August, but the upcoming interim data reads in 2021 will justify its valuation.
A notable laggard in the vaccine race is AstraZeneca (AZN), with its COVID-19 shot developed in partnership with Oxford University recording an overall efficacy rate of only 70% in disease prevention per early data, well below the 95% reported by the approved mRNA-based vaccine developers. The vaccine already cleared in the home market is likely to undergo the U.S. regulatory review in early 2021, as the U.K.-based drug maker expects to submit data from a large American clinical trial by February for FDA approval.
Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), with its late-stage trial fully enrolled, is likely to release interim data in late January for its single-dose vaccine candidate against COVID-19.
