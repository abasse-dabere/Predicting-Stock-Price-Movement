Health,Question for dentist/doctor about lip?,"So, I went the dentist recently and had the dental hygienist basically stick her whole hand in my cheek area and it felt like stretch my cheek area to the max (I actually felt like it was pulling on my gums). Obviously I couldn't really say anything because stuff was in my mouth.

But, now I'm left with one side of my lip reddish and when I open it I see a few splits on the end of my lips.

Did my hygienist in some way make my lips uneven now (is that possible.  As in widen one side)? Or will if heal and go back to the way it was? I'm really concerned about this and really would not like to have an uneven mouth/lip because of this. As of right now, my mouth looks uneven (its basically reddish and looks ""wider"" on that side now).

PS:  IDK what it is about this hygenist.  She was very pulling on pretty much all part of my mouth.  I've never experienced that in my life and don't think its probably a good thing to be doing.",5,5,2010-12-02,PHARMA,0.06173548847436905,0.8962874412536621,0.04197707027196884

Health,Can anyone give me advice on receiving a medical withdrawal from school based on mental health? Pleeease!,"Hello Reddit. This may be more appropriate for /r/depression but this subreddit has never let me down before. Sorry for the incredibly long post!


I am a student from the U.S. studying abroad in Quebec, Canada. About a month into this semester, I slipped back into a deep depression. I was apathetic about everything, slept as many hours a day as I could, and rarely left my apartment. I noticed a lot of similar behaviors from when I was first diagnosed, which is how I knew I had a problem. As such, I did not attend classes, nor care to, and the language barrier I faced easily discouraged me from attempting to socialize.


I spoke to my professors who agreed to let me have a medical withdrawal instead of poor or failing marks. The problem, however, is that my university requires some sort of written notice from a DOCTOR and not a psychologist to approve a medical withdrawal. I'm having trouble finding a doctor who speaks English well (my French is conversational, at best), as well as a doctor that will be willing to give me this note without knowing me or having any information on my medical background. A 20 minute conversation is probably not enough to excuse an entire semester of work.


I have been in touch with my doctor from the states and she informed me that she cannot excuse me from a semester of school for numerous reasons. Mostly because a psychologist would generally be in charge of mental health related withdrawals.


Most of the advice I've been given is to go walk-in clinics and hope a doctor will give me the note or simply to accept the F's and walk away from the situation entirely. I would prefer not to destroy my GPA and transcript because of this though. :( Do any of you have advice for me? I'd appreciate all the help and insight I can get!",5,5,2010-12-03,PHARMA,0.11513226479291916,0.8570489287376404,0.027818851172924042

Health,Ask /r/health: Anyone have luck treating hyperhydrosis (excessive sweating)?,"I have lived with this all my life, and it's extremely annoying and debilitating, especially in the winter. In the summer at least I can just take my shirt off, and being sweaty doesn't really matter so much except for on my hands and public embarrassment (which has hardly bothered me since HS). 

In winter though it's like I'm having a constant hot flash, and I constantly feel clammy all over my body. I'm cold yet I sweat which makes me more cold, so I put on more clothes, which in turn traps more sweat, it's a never ending cycle. On jackets my sleeves are always damp around my hands, I can have anything from a thin t-shirt to 5 layers on and within a couple hours and I'll have a huge sweat mark around my pits permeating out through the jacket even. No one can see, for this reason I tend to buy clothes that don't show up sweat, but it's so disgusting feeling. For the past week I've mostly been sitting around my apartment naked and I take 2-5 showers a day. I don't even like being on the computer cause the mouse feels so sticky and nasty. My feet stick to the floor, slip when I'm walking, and perspiration pools up around them if I'm sitting for more than a few minutes.

I went to a dermatologists years ago and tried a prescription strength anti-antiperspirant, drysol, all this did was give me a rash and irritate the hell out of my arm pits. I didn't notice even a remote decrease in perspiration, so I discontinued using that and haven't really sought further help until now. 

I have done a lot of research, but it seems there's just so many people out there trying to sell books and self help guides I can't tell what is legit and I'm kinda thinking this is just a condition I'll have to live with. It's seriously affecting my life, sometimes I'll just sit and brood over how angry it makes me that I have this problem. I can't even enjoy hanging out with friends sometime, I just want to go sit in the shower, and even that isn't comfortable, I just feel so helpless. I just want to crawl out of my skin, god do I hate this. 

So right now I'm trying sage tea, haven't noticed any benefits yet, and I'm also trying to not not use soap wondering if removing the oils all the time (especially since I shower so often) is causing my body to sweat so much trying to replace it. I rarely use deodorant, it doesn't work anyways, and believe it or not I actually rarely smell bad. Afaik I'm not allergic to anything, but I don't know that for sure. I've thought about fasting too, I've heard it can work, but like I said I don't know what is real and fasting is a very controversial subject and something I don't want to commit to for a week or more if it's just a waste of time. The only other thing I am aware of that I haven't tried is a medication called robinul, but since I don't have money or insurance right now that's not really an option for the time being. Oh, and there's also surgery and botox, botox might be feasible, but I worry it's expensive and I will have to keep getting it done on a regular basis. The surgery on the other hand sounds like a very risky operation that does not have a particularly high success rate and may even cause much, much, worse problems in the long run.",23,6,2010-12-13,PHARMA,0.12353118509054184,0.8514853715896606,0.024983473122119904

Health,"I research addictions in health care workers. I'd like to interview a doctor, nurse, dentist, or similar to weave a personal narrative into an article I'm writing. Your anonymity and comfort will be paramount. Please contact me.","As summarized above, I do a lot of research with addictions, and lately it has been focused on addictions among health care workers. I've read countless papers and been able to be a part of one large questionnaire project, but I've yet to have a real one on one conversation with a health care professional struggling with chemical dependency issues. 

I'd like to write an article for a lay-audience, as I believe I can illicit a mild change in mindset much more quickly that way. The article will acknowledge the risk to public health, but will push for compassion and legislation that recognizes addictions as a legitimate medical problem to be treated while the practitioner continues to work in a reduced or supervised capacity. Dismissing an experienced and knowledgeable professional for having an illness is an unfortunately persistent bit of the previous century's attitude. 

I'm also open to discussing this with students just beginning their professional paths, as academic ""zero-tolerance"" policies seem to be the norm. I feel this is equally inappropriate.

Again, your anonymity and comfort are a priority to me. **Under no circumstances will I reveal your identity.**

Health,"Cured my acid reflux without buying anything. Just thought I'd let you know (not spam, I swear).","I searched ""acid reflux cure"" on Reddit and it was all spam, so I can imagine if you're skeptical. This will prob be downvoted, but I wanted to put it out there in case someone finds it via Google or something.

I'll cut to the chase: I started eating Apples (specifically, ""Red Delicious"" type). You may have heard this before. I probably had, but hadn't paid much attention.

Backstory:

I'm in my early 30's, and I've had bad acid reflux for about 10 years. It sucked. I love coffee, but coffee makes it much worse. Alcohol also makes me flare up.  But even when I avoided these things, I was taking antacids on a daily basis. My esophogus burned (I was worried about getting esophogeal cancer, which is a risk of chronic acid reflux sufferers). 

Suppressing the acid with antacids seem to cause a rebound effect. I tried Prilosec, and though it was very effective (afterall, it stops the production of acid), I had a bad rebound when I went off of it, so I would have been committing to a lifetime of taking it, which scared me. 

I also tried some alternative treatment, like apple cider vinegar. It seemed to help a bit, but I would still regularly get acid reflux. I could wake up and eat all the right things, but I would still get acid reflux.

I tried eating apples: 1-2 apples, eaten in slices throughout the day. I couldn't believe the difference.  The effect was long-lasting, and it was only if I skipped a couple days that the acid would come back.

So I lied in the title of this: I did buy something (the apples). 

I also bought Manuka honey from my local grocer (it's rare that grocery stores have it - you can get it on Amazon). Manuka honey isn't a brand - a number of honey-makers supply it, so I'm not pitching this.

There is some conflicting evidence about whether it's proven to be effective against the bacteria that can cause heartburn (I've never been tested, but I assume I may have it, because other family members tested positive).  I started using that in my tea and stuff, but I'm not sure if it's had a positive effect, because I introduced it shortly after the apples had made a dramatic difference. You may want to look it up - the Amazon reviews are full of people who have experienced dramatic relief from this honey.

I'm actually at a point where I can drink wine and beer no problem, and as long as I don't over-indulge, I get NO acid reflux, which is amazing (previously, it was physically painful to drink alcohol and coffee). 

Coffee still gives me acid reflux, though I can drink tea no prob.

I'm sure I had eaten apples within that 10 years that I was struggling with acid reflux, but I never made the connection that it helped. The difference is dramatic.",71,35,2010-12-17,PHARMA,0.10598423331975937,0.8618715405464172,0.03214423358440399

- Testosterone (total): 44.72 nmol/l (normal range: 10-33)
- SHBG: 71 nmol/l (normal range: 13-58)
- Free testosterone: 0.8311 nmol/l (normal range: 0.24-0.69)
- Thyroxine: 18.5 pmol/l (normal range: 12-21)
- Hemoglobin: 10.2 mmol/l (normal range: 8.3-10.5)
- Prostate specific antigen: 1.3 ug/l (normal: &lt;= 3)
- Liver diagnostics normal


He says those figures are indicative of me taking testosterone either as injections or tablets. I never have. Nor have I taken any other steroids. 


Any ideas? I'm going to see my doctor and then a special section dealing with sexology at the local hospital on Wednesday and the urologist again after new years. I'd love some input, your stories and advice on what I might expect from the doctors and what additional tests might be warranted.

Update: So I had sex last night and things worked pretty well - not optimally, but there were no complaints at all :) Third time in the course of 19 months I have had sex and first time, in that period, for it to be satisfying.

Health,"Reddit, my friend helped a burn victim reclaim his life through an amazing prosthetic hand. Please check out his foundation","The San Jose Mercury News has the full story [here](http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_16932213?source=rss)

Long story short, my friend's brother ran into his buddy who had been severely burned after a car accident (lost his ears and hands, and his upper body/face became disfigured) and felt inspired to help the guy out because his old prosthetic hand was not very good at all.  They began contacting prosthetics companies for help.  Eventually, Scotland-based Touch Bionics got in touch and wanted to learn more.

My friend helped make two videos for the company about the man and how he had adapted to his disabilities.  He would not like to share the videos as they are very private.  That said, Touch Bionics offered to donate their new ""ProDigits partial hand.""  That's a $72,000 value inclusive of all therapy and training.

Now, the man can draw, zip up his clothes, use a fork, and hell, even pass a joint.

This is an amazing feat, and this prosthetic hand is a miracle for him.

My friend and some others have begun the [Bionic Touch Foundation](http://www.bionictouchfoundation.org/) to raise funds for those who cannot afford prosthetic arms or hands. 

This is an incredible story, and hopefully we can spread the word to help others in need.

I need help getting the scientific paper for an article that might really help me manage the side effects of a popular epilepsy drug(the drug is valproate/depakote... , the side effects are being tired all the time , and becoming stupid) .

This drug is a very popular drug for epilepsy and also popular as a mood stabilising drug and  used by many, so this article could help many people.

the article is called : ""Clinical outcomes and low dose levocarnitine supplementation in psychiatric inpatients with documented hypocarnitinemia: a retrospective chart review.""

Health,My way to stop cold sores.,"Okay, so, I get cold sores maybe two or three times a year, and they are annoying, uncomfortable, and they don't look good. I think I got the virus from kissing a girl at a skating rink when I was like 11. Anyway, I figured out how to stop it shortly after you realize it's there.

Here's my way:

As soon as you know you have a cold sore-- like you feel a tingling sensation on your lip or you wake up with it, do this.

Step one: get an ice cube from the fridge and apply it to the area for about 30 seconds. This step should be repeated as often as you have time.

Step two: never let your lips get dry. Always apply a lip treatment, some chapstick with vitamins and what not, that you have found to be good from previous use. I got one called Aveeno and it works fine.

Step three: pick up a bottle of the amino acid pills called Lysine. Check out this article that talks about how cold sores, or the virus in your body, feeds off of Arginine in order to grow. http://www.articlealley.com/article_599635_23.html. Lysine sort of blocks the growth of the cold sore. Take 5 of those pills (they are harmless to take) about 3 times a day, and before bed.

Step four: don't eat greasy food or foods high in Arginine. You don't have to modify your diet for a long time, because after taking Lysine and constantly putting ice on the sore, it will be gone in about two days, and it won't move past the stage before it turns into a sore (when it's red). I guess I should call this cold sore preemptive action.

I know this is sort of a weird topic, but I also know many people get cold sores and really hate them. Anyway, follow the steps I listed, especially applying ice very frequently, and watch your diet. Fasting is a good thing as well-- not eating as much. Your body can fight off a sickness much easier this way.

Abreva, ""the only non-prescription cold sore medication approved by the FDA to shorten healing time and the duration of cold sore symptoms,"" does almost nothing. Don't waste the 16 dollars or whatever it costs to buy it.

TL;DR: Apply ice to the sore as much as you have time. Take 5 capsules of lysine 3 times a day. Don't eat a lot, and not food with Arginine (like nuts and fish).",40,47,2010-12-29,PHARMA,0.05919861048460007,0.911340057849884,0.029461385682225227

Health,Mentally ill family member threatens to bankrupt entire family. Need advice!,"So I had to register a throwaway account for this to ensure that all parties remain anonymous.

My sister-in-law who is just now 17 years old has always had some psychological issues.  Despite being sent to great schools, having wonderful upbringing with a large, yet loving family, the cards were always against her as she was an adopted crack baby.  Though she was treated just like every other child, looking back now things seem to be doomed from the start.

She's currently institutionalized after a serious attempt to kill herself following several instances of suicidal threats that were treated seriously by both her school and her family.  While in the institution she is not getting better. She recently ate an entire jam jar.  The plastic jar, not the jam. 

The current floor she is in costs $500 a day.  She keeps trying to kill herself so they are moving her to the intensive care area that costs $1200 a day. 

Her family had the good fortune of having become very financially successful and raised several children and put them through college. Now the entire thing is at risk.

According to everything we are being told, the insurance will only pay for 30 days worth of treatment.  The government will not intervene to help with payments until her assets are sold and her total net worth is less than 25 thousand dollars. The institution will not allow my sister-in-law to be moved to another facility where it would be much MUCH cheaper (ONLY 150k a year....) as any movement would be considered ATTEMPTED MURDER. Furthermore, the girl cannot be legally disavowed and made a ward of the state without the state pressing charges on the mother for ATTEMPTED MURDER.

If the family were below the poverty line, the state would take all the payment, but in the one year that she has left until her 18th birthday, the family will be bankrupted and be forced to sell everything the mother has worked for.  She is in her 70s and cannot work anymore and everything she has accomplished in her 70 years would be destroyed.

Are there any choices? Any options we haven't thought of?",6,8,2010-12-30,PHARMA,0.1267930418252945,0.8443880081176758,0.02881898358464241
