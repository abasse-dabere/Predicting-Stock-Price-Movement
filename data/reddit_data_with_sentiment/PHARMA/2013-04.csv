biotech,"In college currently, majoring in biology, interested in biotech field","My interests are slowly growing away from med school and towards biology (not too far of a jump) so i'm looking at all the different careers in the biology field. Of the many that pop up biotech seems to interest me the most but i'm confused as to what exactly biotech 'encompasses'. I've read multiple threads but I have a few questions. 

1) Do you have to graduate with a BA/BS of Biotechnology? I have a plain Biology major now (still a freshmen)

2) What kind of careers are available? So far I've seen anything from research to sales to development. I'd be more interested in a more people-focused career, if it helps.

3) I've seen multiple people say that there's only a few 'good' areas for biotech industry/jobs (ie, Boston, Denver, etc) Is this true? Also, is this a good career to get into? Some people say no because it's dying and others say it's going to bloom with new technology in 5-10 years

Health,I'm a student that will be dropped from my Mother's health coverage due to my age and I have some questions about my options.,"Hello  r/health!

   I turn 26 this summer and will be no longer eligible to be on my mother's employee health plan. The fact that they allowed it until 26 is a blessing, nonetheless. 
   However, I'm a full-time student and only have time to work 20 hours a week. My employer only offers health coverage to full-time (40 hour) employees, so getting coverage through them is highly unlikely. 
   My university requires that students have some form of health coverage and offers student comprehensive coverage at $2300 over two terms for those who are not currently on a plan. 
   I am a healthy individual with no history of chronic illness, so I would like to ask all of you if you have any ideas on how I can lower the cost of health coverage. ~ 250 dollars a month for insurance is pretty expensive for a student. I would have to use additional financial aid to cover it. I am certainly under the poverty line due to the fact that I work only 20 hours a week, but I have no dependents.
   
Do any of you know of government assistance programs or other resources for people like me?   Any general advice is appreciated also.

pharmacy,Question for pharmacists.,"Hi, I'm 16 and I'm a junior in high school. Over the past few months, I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do with my life, and what I would do best with. I've been looking into pharmacy, and I think I would like to do that. I might change my mind, but I've been pretty set on this. I've registered for an ROP Medical Occupation class for my senior year.

Health,Possible type of Aphasia and Memory Loss. Thoughts?,"Hey guys-
Wanted to your opinion, I feel like I should see a doctor soon. For the past two years as the title suggests, my memory has severely diminished in a sense that I won't remember what I watch, read, say, or hear from yesterday or even last week. My friends have pointed out that we have the same conversations because I forget that I already addressed them.

I've also noticed a severe decline in my vocabulary. I used to be a frequent writer/public speaker, known for my good sense of vocabulary and always ""had a way with words, able to articulate well while speaking"", per friends and family. 

It seems now that I don't remember any of the bigger words or more interesting sentences I used to be able to lace together. Not only do I not recall them, but I stutter a lot through sentences and sometimes in the midst of conversation, I completely lose train of thought and can't recall a word i'm trying to think of. I know it the word is there, and I've used it before, but it won't come out if that makes sense.

This has been an oddly weird experience for me and I know, it doesn't seem logical that I haven't sought out medical opinion earlier than now. I always thought it had to do with just a typical brain fog from chronic sleep deprivation and never thought anything of it.

I've been reading and it looks like I might have symptoms of a varietal of aphasia? I'm not sure what it is but seems like it's been a complete personality change and linguistic folly.

I don't know if this is the right place to seek advice or opinion on what may be the issue but I'm pretty worried about it and am going finally get into a general or neuro doctor asap.
Let me know what you guys think. Peace and love.

Health,"r/health, I'm worried about someone. Could you help me understand a few things about tuberculosis?","I just found out that someone in my family has been babysitting a child that has been recently exposed to tuberculosis. My family member lives in a country where treatment for TB does not exist. If a resident of the country is found to have TB, they are simply deported without any offer of treatment or care. I am now extremely worried about my family member, as contracting TB will not only affect their health but also their living situation, as being testing positive for TB will force them to leave a country they have been living in for over 10 years.

I have scoured the internet looking for information about how easy it is to contract TB from somebody else who has been exposed, but not necessarily infected. Unfortunately I have only come across conflicting information. I've been told that the child has a ""funny"" cough and is being tested for TB now but I don't know the outcome of that test yet. Needless to say, I'm getting worried for my family member as she is over 50 years old and prone to illness.

Health,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but my little sister is having mysterious recurring seizures, which i fear could be fatal. Can anyone here please help?","Hey everyone, I came here to ask if anyone could give advice on what my little sister is going through. She is 16 and is having recurring seizures. Not the type of seizures that people normally associate with the word (convulsions, uncontrollable body movement), but something much more strange.

She's been having health problems for over a year now. First she had pancreatitis. She got over that, but was still feeling very weak, and not like her normal self. Then, recently, she had strep throat while at school. My sister is not particularly a great student. She's not dumb, but she learns at a much slower pace than most guys and girls. She tends to get frustrated when she's doing schoolwork because she can't figure things out with her work sometimes. Well, apparently she had too much schoolwork, and along with being sick, i guess she just overloaded. That's when the seizures started.

Here's the nature of her seizures:

Her head is usually cocked to one side, and her tongue sticks out, impeding her speech. When she speaks, she talks baby talk, like a 3 or four year old would do. Her right arm is usually frozen in one position. These seizures can last from about 30 minutes to several hours. And as far as i know, it's been happening every day.

She's been in and out of the hospital more times than I can count, and the doctors have no clue what is wrong with her. They ran an EEG on her earlier this morning while she was having a seizure and the doctors couldn't find anything wrong. She's been to every type of doctor imaginable (neurologist, psychologist, etc.) and they all say the same thing. My parents are seeming to run out of options. I wanted to ask here to see if anyone can offer any advice. If you have any advice, it would be appreciated.

medicine,Medical ethics question,"Hello, 
I'm writing a medical ethics essay for a class and this prompt has got me stumped. Not looking for anyone to do my homework for me, just curious as to what a 'good' doctor would do in this scenario.

You are an OB/GYN working at a county hospital near Miami, FL. A husband and wife, who are from an impoverished foreign country and who are only in the US for a wedding, come in to your clinic as the wife is about to give premature birth to their first child. The child is born with two problems

1) Esophageal atresia. This means that the esophagus ends in a blind pouch and is not connected to the stomach. This problem is easily correctable with a simple surgery, but if nothing is done, the baby will not be able to eat and will die within days.

2) Down's Syndrome. This is a genetic condition that results in severe mental retardation and other conditions. There is no treatment or cure, and patient usually live into their 20s.

You inform the couple of these problems. They tell you that, in their country, mentally retarded people are treated very badly. They are sent off to institutes, which are more like concentration camps and are abused and mistreated until they die. They are not given rights or opportunities to live a life like other children. Saying that they do not wish for this to happen to their baby, they ask you not to perform the surgery to fix the esophageal atresia so that the baby will die and they can go home. Explain the interests of the parents, the baby, the foreign government, the OB/GYN physician and the County Hospital. What would you say to the parents? What would you do or not do to the baby?",16.0,7,2013-04-06,PHARMA,0.09642231464385986,0.8799083232879639,0.023669347167015076

i have tried working out to gain weight, but generally i just get veiny and toned. so i figure i should try to gain fat instead. i already eat unhealthy, and that hasnt added any(maybe its building up in my veins, idk) it just messes with my digestion.

medicine,"Doctors of Reddit, can you explain why the medical community is so skeptical of estrogen as a treatment for mental illness (especially depression)?","****
Edit: I wanted to make sure it is clear I am not advocating blanket use of estrogen. It is clear there are a large number of cases of depression where estrogen appears to be the cause (particularly postpartum and menopausal cases), as well as links between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. But I also recognize that there are likely other sources of these illnesses that are not responsive to estrogen treatment. My question mainly revolves around why estrogen is still not used in patient populations where research is pretty clear that it is not just effective but curative.
****

There is a vast amount of research that demonstrates 1) estrogen's crucial role in brain function, particularly its role in neurotransmitter health, and 2) estrogen's effectiveness in treating various forms of depression, schizophrenia, and possibly bipolar disorder. Mentioning estrogen draws immediate resistance and responses like ""that is not evidence-based practice."" But when one reviews the research, it is clear that estrogen has much stronger evidence for its efficacy than the drugs these doctors are prescribing.

***** Edited to add research links

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/219802

Appears to be the first study...all the way back in 1979. One problem with this study was a synthetic estrogen was used. It is likely that greater results would have been achieved using 17b-estradiol. Also, this was a general study on depression. Some of the women had depression for many years and it is possible the source of their depression was not estrogen deficiency. In fact, the study notes the treatment effect was much higher in some women while other women showed no effect - and the women who showed no effect were the ones who had been depressed many years.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8598756

As far as I can tell, this study in 1996 was the next study to look at the issue. That's a 17 year gap. Dr. John Studd was an OB/GYN on this study. He has since become an advocate for using estrogen to treat depression in women. Supposedly he established a center at the Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London when he worked there, but I do not live in London so I don't know. His website http://www.studd.co.uk contains a lot of information. He is well known for his work on hormone therapy and the role of estrogen in preventing osteoporosis. Interestingly, Dr. Studd indicates on his website that his research team attempted to do a larger study mirroring this one but were frustrated in their efforts because they could not find a drug company that would manufacture the placebo patches they needed.

""The Ahokas Studies""

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10591876

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10706019

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11411813

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10817099

These small studies were published in 1999-2001 by Dr. Antti Ahokas, a prominent Finnish psychiatrist. In total they involve 14 women with postpartum psychosis and 23 women with severe postpartum depression. Dr. Ahokas undertook these studies after reviewing the above study by Dr. Studd and others, and reviewing other literature on estrogen and postpartum illness. All patients in the studies were unresponsive to conventional medical treatment (antipsychotics, antidepressants, CBT, and ECT). Patients were given high doses of 17b-estradiol sublingually with the goal of bringing estrogen levels to ""normal"" values very rapidly. In all cases, patients showed very rapid improvement, and relief of mental symptoms coincided with increases in estrogen levels. In one patient with psychosis, treatment was stopped because the patient felt better and psychosis returned within one week. Treatment was restarted and symptoms were relieved again. I have corresponded with Dr. Ahokas and he continues to treat postpartum mental illnesses with estrogen.

The Ahokas studies are to me very compelling. Their flaw is that they are small and do not feature a placebo. Dr. Ahokas was already sure that estrogen was effective, so he states that placebos were not used for ethical reasons. Of course, large double blind placebo trials are the gold standard, but studies that do not follow this format cannot be dismissed out of hand (as many medical professionals did when I shared Dr. Ahokas's studies with them). For one, the results of this study are hard to explain as a placebo issue: ALL patients showed 100% remission of symptoms. That would be one heck of a placebo, particularly with something as serious as psychosis, and in patients who failed to respond to previous treatment. While a study that shows a treatment effect of, say 10%, could be susceptible to bias created by lack of a control group, it is hard (impossible) to imagine observing complete remission of symptoms without actual relief of symptoms occurring.

There are more studies on the use of estrogen, namely those involving menopausal women and schizophrenia (you can easily find these with a search on PubMed). I will possibly link them here and discuss them when I have more time. There are also studies on estrogen's effects in the brain, as well as a book written by one of the world's leading neuroscientists, called Estrogen - Mystery Drug for the Brain?: The Neuroprotective Activities of the Female Sex Hormone. Amazon link: http://www.amazon.com/Estrogen-Mystery-Neuroprotective-Activities-Hormone/dp/3211835393/

This review of research on estrogen treatment of postpartum disorders is a pretty good summary of the above research: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/7424909_The_role_of_estrogen_therapy_in_postpartum_psychiatric_disorders_an_update.

I actually agree with the ""Focus Points"" section that more research is needed and the available research is imperfect. But that is mainly from a purely scientific perspective. From a practical perspective, a reasonable person should conclude that the evidence for the use of estrogen is strong and the risk is low (much lower than current treatment methods). Yet medical professionals will not give estrogen for depression (and often give drugs that make the problem much worse).

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10831472
Double blind study where pregnancy and postpartum period was simulated through addition of hormones to mimic pregnancy, then withdrawal of hormones to mimic postpartum period. 8 women in the study group had a history of postpartum depression. 8 women in the control group had no history. On hormone withdrawal, 5 of 8 women in the study group rapidly developed signs of mood disturbance. None of the women in the control group developed symptoms. This study established two things: 1) Postpartum mood disorders likely have a hormonal cause, and 2) Postpartum mood disorders likely have a genetic component, as it confirmed what has been known for some time: certain women show a high vulnerability while others show no vulnerability.

*** Clinical Trials

There are two clinical trials testing estrogen use for postpartum depression that I know of. They are currently ongoing. Why did it take more than 30 years to get such large studies going? That is an interesting question itself.

I work in multiple cancer centers and clinics. My role chiefly involves counseling and testing patients, serving on numerous committees, and educating a wide range of physicians (Med/Onc, Hem/Onc, Gyn/Onc, Rad/Onc, GYN, Primary care, GI, Surgery, Pathology, Urology...) on identifying and managing patients at risk for hereditary cancer. 

I played an integral role to get 3 area hospitals to agree to begin screening all newly diagnosed colon cancers for Lynch syndrome. All positive screens are reported to me, and I notify the MDs and then have a consult with the patient. 

I have diagnosed patients with: BRCA, Lynch, FAP/AFAP/MAP, Li-Fraumeni, RB1, Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer, Cowden, MEN1/2A/B, Juvenile polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers, Birt-Hogg-Dube, Von-Hippel-Lindau, and HLRCC syndromes. I help to provide risk management for the patient and their families, and interpret tricky test results. 

If you only take home 1 thing: any family with 3 or more blood related relatives with any combination of breast/ovary/pancreas/prostate cancer, warrants a referral for that family to genetic counseling. 

What do you want to know about (cancer) genetics or genetic testing? How can I help you? Sure, run a case by me. 

The incidence of BRCA is 1 in 400, or 1 in 40 in the Askenazi Jewish population. The incidence of Lynch is estimated to be 1 in 300-400.

* I have no energy. I can sleep for hours and hours and hours. However, I can only sleep like that during the day. At night, I am wide awake. Always.
* I have little to no motivation. Unless I'm going out or my boyfriend comes home, my hair is up in a bun, I have no make up on, and I'm in jammies. Always. It takes me days to clean one room. I procrastinate like no other.
* I often feel as though no one wants to be around me, or cares what I have to say, or how my day went, and because I have no energy or motivation, I constantly feel like the fat, lazy friend who secretly bugs everybody. 
* When I'm around people, I feel okay, but when I'm alone, I feel so alone. Nights are especially hard.
* I bruise easily, mainly my shins, but I've also had bruises my bra has given me that haven't gone away for months.
* I often have a dizzy, foggy feeling going on in my head.
* My body hurts, everywhere. It's not severe, but it's annoying. I have upper and lower back problems, my ankles and wrists constantly hurt.

Health,My boyfriend swallowed a long turkey bone...,"You know the those huge turkey legs at fairs? Well he was suckling on a bone trying to get the last bits of meat and his throat took it down with his consent. It was about 5-6'' long.

I'm not expecting my doctor to prescribe anything to me, but I have some questions about antidepressants just incase. I'm going to ask him too but I have some questions for people who are already on them. I hope this is the correct subreddit and you guys don't mind.

What I want to know is what I should expect from the drugs...

Like how you feel on them. I'm guessing its a bit subjective depending on the person, but I guess I'm wondering generally.

Do they make you feel happier? I've heard them being called 'happy pills' before. Do they just block out certain thoughts?

medicine,"Doctors(and current medical students) of r/medicine, did you feel a ""calling"" to a career in medicine? If so, how did it manifest, what sparked your interest, and how did you feel before you began your careers?","I’m writing because I’m about a month away from applying to medical school and I’m desperately trying to make sure medicine is the right path for me, so in the following post I plan to describe how I feel and the source of some of the doubts I have in hopes that some r/medicine readers will be able to empathize or potentially even suggest alternative careers. Though it would mean a lot to me to know others felt similarly to how I feel currently, please feel free to answer the question in the title directly without having to work your way through the massive wall of text below.

I have a lot of reasons for wanting to be a physician, but I think for the most part they’re what you often see in pre-med students. I enjoy meeting new people and I’ve liked my previous jobs where I was able to help strangers face-to-face. I’m naturally interested in my science classes and do well in them, and I don’t mind studying as much as everyone else seems to. It might sound weird, but I’ve also worked in hospitals and really enjoy the setting and atmosphere. Maybe most importantly though, I’ve shadowed physicians and I think I can see myself enjoying the work they do for the rest of my life, and hopefully without sounding like too much of a prick, I really believe I’d be good at the work they do and well-suited for the career.

I hope that you might be able to relate to some of my reasons for being interested in medicine, but I’ve mentioned them here in the hopes of being able to better explain my doubts and concerns. On all the articles I’ve read about becoming a doctor(and at this point, I’m pretty sure I’ve read all of them) and on all the threads on SDN about choosing medicine, the word “calling” gets thrown around all the time. It always seems to read something like “don’t do it for the money, don’t do it for the prestige, don’t do it for helping people(because there are easier ways to help people). Medicine is nothing short of a calling.”, leaving the definition of what “calling” means painfully ambiguous. 

My concern is I don’t know if I have whatever a calling to medicine really is. Like I said, I really think I’d enjoy work as a doctor and I think I’d do well in the field, but I haven’t been committed to medicine since I went to my first check-up. If I look, I can see myself as someone who isn’t a doctor. It isn’t so impossible for me to imagine being a dentist or a chemist or a pharmacist or a high school teacher or a million other things.

I know medicine can be grueling in its demands, I know it means a lot of work and commitment and nights on-call, but I don’t really know what it’s like personally to work 80 hours a week for years on end, and I can’t bear the thought of sinking into $200,000 dollars in student loan debt, only to come out of the other end of medical school thinking I’m really not up for doing this for the rest of my life.

So, all of that said, I’ll rephrase my question in the title. Did you all have similar reasons for entering medicine, or were your motives more concrete and non-negotiable? Did you have similar doubts? And how did it end up for you?",32.0,7,2013-04-16,PHARMA,0.048596903681755066,0.9231162071228027,0.028286926448345184

medicine,"Looking for advice, considering a drastic career change into psychiatry","Hello,

I am a 25 year old male living in the UK.

I have a BA in Film and Literature and MSc in Social Psychology. Since graduation, I have been working here and there in digital marketing.
I quit my job around 6 months ago, feeling a lack of direction and purpose. I feel a strong attraction towards psychiatry because I feel I am well equipped - strong interpersonal skills, wide range of interests and academic knowledge regarding social sciences, psychology and cultural theory. Many of my close friends with backgrounds in medicine have suggested I would be a great psychiatrist. Having been heaped in theory, I think it will do me a world of good to work towards a profession where I can put it into practice and help others.
I have a couple of key questions, maybe some of you could help:

1) At this point in my career / life would it be advisable to somewhat 'start over from scratch' and pursue medicine? Would it be wiser to consider clinical psychology given my degree in psychology?

2) I would definitely want to study abroad in the US or Canada if I were to commit myself for another decade of studying and training- what are the key differences/challenges studying medicine in the US/Canada being a UK resident? Would the years of study differ abroad given that I am already a graduate?

medicine,A confession from an intensivist,"I am an intensivist, and have been working in a medium sized suburban community hospital for many years. I have to confess that I'm positively bored. Since my training, years ago, I cannot say that anything I do is much of a challenge, and the cases I see are all about the same. On top of this, a large segment of physicians here are old guard who haven't updated their medical knowledge in 30 years, and who practice malpractice medicine without a lawsuit daily. I'm one of the few who recognizes this, so that even if I wanted to do something more innovative than the Stone Age, most would look at me like I was a lunatic. I've tried to make use of this time by learning new procedures, and expanding my knowledge and practice, but it doesn't matter because I can never utilize anything I learn. Unfortunately, my lowly pedigree prevents me from getting employment at an academic center, and it's not for lack of trying. Lately, I'm finding it especially difficult to even fake taking anything that happens at the hospital seriously. I should be more enthusiastic, because we recently became a mostly closed ICU. But I haven't seen a great change, least not the kind I expected. 

So that's all. It was something I wanted to get off my chest. 

EDIT: thanks for all the advice. The most important thing is just to get satisfaction outside of work. A job is a job. It's not my life.

Health,My friend is in a coma,"Hi r/health,

I've discovered this subreddit moments ago because I wanted to get some advice on the situation of a friend of mine. I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask this and I'm aware that I will probably not get any certainty about my friends situation, but I need some perspective on everything.

On the 5th of April a friend of me had a ski-accident and fell of a cliff. He smacked against a rock 30 meters below and suffered multiple broken bones &amp; ribs, a perforated lung, a double concussion and more. He lost consciousness almost immediately, but the rescue team got to him pretty quick. In the hospital, the doctors placed him in a coma. After a few days, when they wanted to get him out of it, they couldn't. Another couple of days later, the pressure in his brains lowered and they stopped giving him the medication that induces a coma. Finally 3 days ago (Tuesday) he woke up.

The thing is, they did some tests and decided he was conscious, but he could barely move, couldn't talk and was only conscious for short time periods. He then got a fever because of an infection and had to take antibiotics. I was hoping that the worst period (the coma) was over, but apparantly he slipped into a coma again... 

Unfortunately I have very limited knowledge about comas. Can somebody give me some perspective on this situation? It's hard for me to really estimate how bad/good he is really doing and what the chances are for him to survive...

I'd appreciate every small response, that can give some closure. Even if it isn't a good closure. Thanks in advance.",3.0,8,2013-04-19,PHARMA,0.12077908217906952,0.8358592391014099,0.043361686170101166

biotech,Help! Masters in Biotechnology or Molecular/Cellular/Developmental Biology,"Hi all!

So I got into both masters programs I applied for. One is a Masters in Biotechnology and one is a Masters in Molecular/Cellular/Developmental Biology...


I want the Masters in MCDB because I am actually attending the school as an undergraduate, I work in a lab in which I have my own mini project (a project I will continue to work on till the next year if I stay and it has a potential of being published) , I know a majority of the graduate students (I have a huge support group for Grad school if I attend here), the advisors, and I know some of the professors as well or I at least know their teaching/testing style....This is also a one year program.


However...the Biotech program is a two year program and the only appeal is that they have subcategories to choose from such as bacterial pathogenesis.


My issue is that when I graduate, would I have equal chances of getting jobs in the Biotech industry with either Masters? I would love to take the MCDB Masters program but I am worried that the two year Biotech program, due to the title, would be better at getting me a job in the Biotechs. Does it matter in the end?

Health,"Could this be rheumatic fever, or just part of strep?","**sorry for all the text, tldr at bottom**

I'm concerned about my child[6]. I already took her to the doctor for treatment but now I'm second guessing it.  
 
On Wednesday (possibly Tuesday night) she came down with a fever. It was mild (below 101) for a day, then she got chills and it went up to 102. Tylenol &amp; Motrin could bring it down to 100.4.  She had bad abdominal pain but mostly when the fever was spiking (not near her appendix).  Thursday it was taking longer for the Tylenol to bring the fever down and the results had a shorter duration, plus she stopped eating, so I took her in to the doctor.  A quick test found Strep.  Her throat was red and her lymph nodes a little swollen, but she had not once complained about throat pain so I didn't check those areas. She's been on amoxicillin since Thursday and is much better; fever is gone, she's eating, and her energy is better.  Her neck is still a little swollen, and she keeps getting little nosebleeds.

Here's why I'm worried about rheumatic fever:
 
1) a few weeks ago she started having abdominal pain; it started one night with some dizziness. Doctor over the phone said it sounded like some stomach upset. No fever, no sore throat, just the pain. After a few doctor appts that found nothing we figured it was psychological, especially since she said it would feel better after hugs and talking out issues that were stressful for her; the abdominal pain has been present on and off all these weeks and then it definitely got worse with the strep fever. The doctor who diagnosed strep said that sometimes all he's seen is a stomach ache and it turned out to be strep. I didn't think to mention the previous abdominal pain because I had written that off mentally as psychological; and this was a different doctor from the one who checked her when the abdominal pain first started. 
 
2)she has had some knee pain in each knee at different times; we had believed it was related to her dance class (she was previously diagnosed with a patella strain in 1 knee); no redness or swelling however at all. 
 
3) the nosebleeds... which I have read are present with rheumatic fever; when it started we again thought it was related to something else -she has really bad allergies this season (just officially diagnosed earlier this week) but they definitely became more prevalent this week since the diagnosis of strep. Not heavy, but frequent.
 
4) my father's family was decimated by rheumatic fever when he was a kid; I've heard it runs in families.
 
5) the week before her stomach pain started she did have a brief (3 day) very mild (100.3) fever with no other symptoms; I didn't think anything of it and it didn't last beyond 3 days so I didn't take her in to the doctor.  However, I should point out that when I was a kid I was diagnosed several times with strep (positive culture) even without any fever; I just didn't think of this since my daughter didn't have a sore throat and previously had never been diagnosed with strep
 
So taken in bits and pieces it doesn't sound like much, but looking at everything as a whole (positive strep culture, knee pain, nosebleeds, recurrent abdominal pain, family history), this is starting to hit my panic button.  Especially since I don't know what rheumatic fever truly looks like from start to finish, but I did grow up seeing my dad freak out every time I had the slightest sore throat.  Not sure if I should just let the antibiotics run their course and evaluate as time goes on or if I should be rushing her in for another appt asap.  

**TLDR**Daughter[6] recently diagnosed with and being treated for strep. Putting together some of her isolated health issues over the previous 4 weeks, I'm now worried that she might actually have rheumatic fever. I need insight on the presentation of rheumatic fever (I've already read the diagnostic criteria) to figure out if this is a ""wait and see"" or a ""need an appt. asap"".",5.0,5,2013-04-20,PHARMA,0.2650125026702881,0.7077654004096985,0.02722211927175522

Health,Been having sudden paralyzing nausea/vomiting/headaches at least twice a week for about 3 years and doctors don't care. What can I ask them to test for?,"Multiple times a week, I randomly go into a paralyzing (almost having to crawl to the bathroom) nausea and vomiting fit. It will happen out of nowhere in the middle of doing different things, waking up, or just at some point in the day. It used to happen almost everyday at around the same time (11am-noon area), but now happens whenever and usually more at night now. My nutrition has changed drastically over the past 3 years, from eating like a pig everyday, to not eating for 2.5 days, so even though my nutrition was the first thing I blamed, I do not understand how such drastic changes have taken place and nothing has changed. The first time I told a doctor about this being a major issue was back in March 2010 and they really didn't have anything to say about it. It has affected my life greatly and I'll be at work and have to stop doing something (when I was perfectly fine minutes before) and run to the bathroom until I can calm my stomach down (which usually doesn't happen for a bit, or until I go to sleep to make it go away). Luckily, I work early mornings and the issues tend to be at night now as oppose to mid morning/early afternoon like they were for the first couple years. I have thrown up on the sides of roads so many times and always have to have a towel or something in the car, just in case I don't make it till my boyfriend pulls over. It is not predictable in any way and I've learned that I have to warn my boyfriend to get me in a comfortable setting (pull over/find public restroom) as soon as I feel it coming because I don't have much time before it gets bad. I have ruined so many dinners, shopping trips, planned activities because of me getting sick out of nowhere. 



It usually starts with a overpowering headache (which sometimes doesn't occur), that causes insane nausea, that causes (usually) violent or projectile vomiting that doesn't have an end. This all happens in a matter of 5 mins or less. Hiccups also tend to be a constant symptom when I'm about to get sick. Sometimes I wake up nauseous, throw up shortly after, and my stomach is completely empty (almost water vomit), even if I ate a ton right before I went to bed. I have not figured out a constant in my life to cause this because I do/eat nothing that I used to when this stuff started and my schedules/routines are completely different.


**Health history:** 

 My health has also changed drastically, in other ways, in the past 3 years. At one point, I was not financially able to eat more than one mcdouble a day, and when I went to the doctor, my urine test definitely reflected my lack of nutrition (doctor was pretty astonished at stuff like ketone levels). But, I have since had a few urine tests and have not heard anything about them being bad. I was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and started those meds back in January and have not noticed them affecting anything physical. I was hospitalized for mono (and a few other things that lack of strong immune system caused during that period) back in Oct 2008. I recently purchased a blood glucose monitor and started checking myself whenever I felt sick at the only time it has been low (44), was when I came home from a normal day at work and felt fine.  I am 22 years old, female, was diagnosed with PCOS in 2011, no other known medical issues as far as I can remember. I assume I have been tested for 'routine' things when I have had blood drawn 2-3 times in the past 3 years and have not heard anything negative. I am STD/HIV free (tested recently), most likely do not have a gluten allergy because I can eat a whole loaf of bread in one sitting. Have not noticed any other consistent food issues (a lot of the time I get sick before I have eaten food, or after eating 3 balanced meals). I am allergic to penicillin and wool. Drug/alcohol free as well. 

Posting this to see if anyone experienced/experiences the same things or has an idea of what is wrong. The best ideas have been from other people I talk to saying what they think the issue could be, and me ruling it out after looking into it (ex: gluten allergy and blood sugar issues). I am not asking to be diagnosed (as I'm sure that is looked down upon on reddit), just looking for ideas or what I should ask my doctor to test me for (since they could care less about how much this negatively affects my life). Thanks for reading either way:)

Health,Debating whether or not to get radioactive iodine treatment for Graves' Disease (hyperthyroid),"I was diagnosed with Grave's Disease (hyperthyroidism) in the fall of 2011. I've been on Methimazole since (25mg daily, which is a pretty high dose) I tried weaning it down but I became hyperthyroid again. My endocrinologist has been pushing for radioactive iodine treatment since my first visit. Everything I've read about it says it's completely safe, but putting enough radiation in my body to kill one of my organs seems wrong to me. I've been told it's enough radiation that if I cross the border within a few months of having it done I will set off the radiation detectors.



The biggest conflict I have is that I am supposed to limit contact with other people for a number of weeks following the treatment. If this radiation does not pose a risk to me why would it pose a risk to others? It seems contradictory. If the radiation can 'leak' from my body and affect the person next to me, surely it can affect the rest of my body. Am I missing something?
Are there risks to this that my doctor is down-playing/doesn't know about? Has anyone had it and regretted it?



Another question that no one seems to be able to answer for me: I am a veterinary technician and part of my job includes taking x-rays. Because of this I have a government issued dosimeter that measures my radiation exposure.



A) Will handling this dosimeter cause the reading to peak? How long should I avoid contact with dosimeters as to not falsely elevate the readings?



B) I am 'allowed' to be exposed to a certain amount of radiation annually, and a maximum in my lifetime. Will RAI affect those amounts? Should I limit the x-rays I take? I have called Heath Canada (they issue the dosimeters) and the person I spoke with couldn't answer me and I was passed around to people who also weren't able to give me an answer. If I am told I should no longer take x-rays, it would affect my future job prospects (""Hi, I'd like to work for you but I could never take x-rays"" is not a great thing when interviewing in my field)",3.0,5,2013-04-21,PHARMA,0.07795946300029755,0.8934069871902466,0.028633618727326393

Health,Scaphoid bone non-union surgery. Long term results,"I am just posting this to maybe see if anyone has, or is having a similar experience with this. 
In 2002 I broke my wrist playing high school football. Like a lot of people who break their scaphoid bones in their wrists, I didn't realize it was actually broken until months later, when I went to the doctor complaining of persistent pain. They recognized the non union pretty much on the spot. From there they determined I needed the non-union surgery with the Herbert screw to help fuse the bones. I got the surgery and was sent away with a cast for 6 weeks. Pretty standard. 

The bone did fuse entirely and every was pretty much good except I never really fully recovered the full range of motion with my wrist and always experienced pain when putting pressure on it (bending forward or back). For the next 8 or so years I was able to just push through it, take some ibuprofin or some painkiller, so I could lift weights, play tennis or do yard work or whatever. Now, about 10 years out from having the surgery, the pain has gotten so bad that I can't do any of those things anymore without getting very significant excruciating pain. After doing things I was pretty much able to do with no trouble 5 years ago, my hand and wrist are sore for a couple days after, for example, just one weight lifting session.

I went back to the original doctor who did the surgery, and after taking an X-Ray and looking at it he basically said that occasionally the bones will heal and be rough around the edges which may lead to arthritis. Despite that he admitted there was hardly any evidence of arthritis by looking at the cartilage through the X-Ray. So I went away with the doctor basically telling me ""umm yeaahh that can happen so stay off of it and take pain killers for the rest of your life"". I am a 26 year old guy and hate to think that because of this I will only have partial use of my right hand for the rest of my life.

I am in the process of getting an MRI and second opinion from another doctor in hopes of uncovering something the first doctor missed. 

Since I have found that this is a fairy common injury and surgery, I just wanted to take a shot and ask if anyone else is having or has had similar issues? I have read about a few people having to have the screw(s) taken out but not more than a year or 2 after the initial surgery. It would be a great help and insight if anyone had any experience or advice. Thanks reddit!

Health,"Fracture/Sprain/Broken bone in foot? Went bowling 2 nights in a row, it's been one week, hasn't healed, only getting worse.","As the title says, I went bowling. I love bowling.

Things to note about the bowling nights:

Friday night: standard bowling alley. Nice lanes, lots of balls to choose from. Woke up Saturday, felt great.

Saturday night: this different alley was the extension of a bar. Only 8 lanes, not many balls to choose from. I ended up using a 15lb ball where I normally use 12lb. The lane we had seemed VERY slanted to the left. I normally avg like 170 in scoring and am very consistent, and had to aim WAYYYY to the right to adjust for what seemed to be a massive slant in the lane.

I am 5'10, 170lbs, and a right handed bowler. 

Woke up Sunday morning, could barely walk on my left foot.

Definitely seemed bone related and not muscle-related. 

No swelling, no bruising. Thought maybe an internal bruise on the bone.

Location of pain: left foot, left side of foot. Basically where the 'foot bones' meet the pinky toe and fourth toe. Some pain in the middle too.

How the pain feels: sitting down at computer, no big deal. Walked to get a burrito (prob 100yds if even) and the pain becomes worse and worse the more I walk. 

I've done some manual labor at work today (lifting and such) and the throbbing pain is still there.

Really don't want to see a doctor...pretty tight on cash right now.

**tl; dr** pain that gets worse with strenuous activity/walking. No improvement since 2nd night of bowling. Pissed as fuck because I was running 3 times a week. And yes I'm stupid and have not put any ice/warmth on it.

Any advice is appreciated.

Health,A question about sinus tachycardia,"Background: 26 F - possibly epileptic 

The last month has seemed to be test after test after test; those tests specific to my seizure activity include an EEG, Holter Monitor, another EEG, soon to be another much longer term EEG and potentially an MRI.

I recently got my results back from my holter monitor and found something that I found to be interesting.
The only abnormal result that came back were sinus tachycardia spikes. Though my average heart rate was between 80 and 90 bpm, my heart rate jumped to spikes of 170 ~ 180 bpm while I was sleeping.

I know this question is and isn't directly related to epilepsy, however, perhaps someone might have somewhat of an explanation or idea why this is happening and if there is any way this could be linked to my seizure activity and auras?

I'm not hoping for a diagnosis, or by any means trying to play doctor, I'm just curious if anyone might have an explanation or thoughts on the issue.

Health,Red circular spots on neck-- what is this?,"Here is a picture of me this morning: [1] http://i.imgur.com/sEoePBL.jpg  

* 27 y/o 

* this particular symptom has been occurring for about 6 months 

* It does not itch 

* I have been diagnosed with lupus; however, I've never felt good about this Dx, as I know people with lupus and it is nothing like theirs.

I have seen many many doctors over the years, including a two week stint in mayo clinic where I was diagnosed with Kikuchi's disease (a short term illness). After it went on for a few years, my rheumatologist changed the Dx to lupus. I find that my flares occur primarily when I get stressed out. Additionally, I've NEVER had the butterfly rash; the red splotches always appeared around my temples... that is, until about six months ago. Out of nowhere, I stopped getting red splotches on my temples and it started appearing as red circular spots on my neck/chest instead.

This isn't me getting flushed-- the spots are very pronounced and have been there for a few months now. I have been putting some steroid cream used for psoriasis on it for awhile and it was working at first, but it hasn't seemed to do much lately.

Health,I have been diagnosed with Lyme Disease. I feel it may actually be syphilis and my doctors aren't catching it. Is this possible?,"About 2 months ago i went on a cruise and had unprotected sex with a sorority girl that could possibly carry some sort of STI.  For the next two months, I have been having joint pain, fatigue, stinging in my penis.  I went to the doctor to have bloodwork done(including STI tests).  The blood work was conclusive for Lyme Disease and i was negative for every STI we tested for.  

The thing is, we didn't test for Syphilis because that requires something much more than bloodwork.  

My question is - if it showed up as lyme disease, is there any possibility that it is actually Syphilis. Or would the lyme disease just merely not show up.

Thanks - this concern arose when i read that Syphilis and Lyme are actually cousins.",10.0,8,2013-04-29,PHARMA,0.05514734238386154,0.9122372269630432,0.03261542692780495
