Health,Is it okay to prescribe antibiotics for ear inflammation without knowing the cause for it?,"I apologize if no medical questions regarding your own wellbeing are allowed, but I didn't find anything about that in the sidebar.
Anyways, yesterday I woke up with my left ear feeling like cotton have been stuffed there, decrease in hearing and increased ringing in it. I feel no pain in it, I have no runny nose in general (the most i get atm is 'thawing' when I come from a cold place into a warm one), tho I did get some liquid, watery snot leaking out of my left nostril while I was falling asleep yesterday (lying on my left side too). I also have no fever, no sore throat. I went to my family doctor a few hours ago, she said that the ear looks bad, red inside. The throat and other ear are completely okay though. She prescribed amoxicillin for a week and revisit her next Monday. I'm a bit stumped at that, since I read on the net that if the cause is viral the antibiotics are worthless AND I have no other symptoms that usually accompanied my ear inflammations. When I asked the doc about that she told me that 'no ear [inflammation, infection] is treated without antibiotics'. It also is a common mistake by family doctors here to prescribe antibiotics for *flu*. I also had something like that, but in both ears around 3 years ago and spent over a month hanging around house half-deaf, despite several rounds of antibiotics.. And another moment is that the cause might be my shower the day before, I got a lot of water in my ear during my head wash, tried rinsing it out by screwing off the shower-head and putting the water stream into my ear (not smart, i know), then drying with a corner of a tissue shaped into a drill, then blow-drying.. Not sure if I got all the water out, nor how clean it was.  Anyways, thank you in advance for any reply and dafuq should I do?

medicine,Considering transferring into nursing from premed - advice?,"Hey y'all. 

I'm just about to finish my second year as an undergraduate premedical student and I've recently begun to think about pursuing a temporary career in nursing. The plan is to leave, finish out a BSN program by the time I’m 22, and work until I’m 30 years old before reconsidering medical school. It's not that I consider the job ""easier"" or can't take the premed curriculum - at least, I don't THINK that's why I'm doing it. I’ve worked as an EMT and I understand the profoundly important role that everyone plays at each step of the medical system, and further how each person SIGNIFICANTLY contributes to the efficacy and efficiency of the whole system, and it’s for this reason that I’m considering entering the field of nursing. 

I've spent a lot of the last year studying the basic philosophy behind medicine and historical developments that have led up to modern medical practice (and the problems inherent in it) – with all of the changes that will (hopefully) be coming to medical practice in the next decade or so, I'm thinking now might not be the best time to become a doctor. 

Downvote me to hell if you think this is disrespectful, but I feel like world of nursing isn't necessarily going to be as subject to broad-scale changes as the world of physicians in the coming years. The job of a nurse is to care for the daily health of a patient whereas it is the role of the physician to coordinate curative therapy for the primary disease afflicting the patient – and since we as a society are asking significant questions about how it is most efficacious to do so, on a broad scale, I feel like taking this time to acquaint myself with the interior workings of homeostatic medical care is the best option for me. Learning how to treat patients at the level of a nurse will inform how I care for them as a doctor, and I believe that it will do so in a beneficial regard. I mainly question the choice to become a doctor right now because the mentality and approach to medical care at that level is currently in a state of flux. This isn't a concern about job security or being able to ""handle"" the changes - I feel like being able to examine how it is changing from an outside-in perspective would help me shape the most appropriate response once I'm integrated into the system.

I’m aware this sounds disrespectful, I only now just realized it, but these are my thoughts. I apologize if it seems demeaning.

I am very interested in continuing to learn about the philosophical theory of medicine, as well as getting a proper understanding of healthcare infrastructure and how it’s going to be expected to change, but the medical learning obviously takes priority over either of those personal interests.

medicine,"Next week, I get to sit down and chat with a medical director of a large regional insurance company.  What might be the most useful things to ask them about?","I'm an MS1 with an interest in primary care and contributing to improving the business side of medicine.  I realize that my main focus right now should be on my education and training, but I think getting a behind-the-scenes understanding might be useful.  I have very little experience with that side of the industry, which is why I'm talking to them in the first place.  I have a few things on my mind, but I'm wondering if there is anything else that would be interesting to ask about.

Here's what I'm thinking of asking about:

- What are some obstacles to a pay-for-performance model and what are some other models in consideration?  If patient outcomes influence pay, will doctors in difficult populations be undervalued?  Who decides the pay-for-performance structure and what factors influence their decisions?

- If practices are being bought out more and more by larger groups, what is being done to ensure that competition remains and that monopoly does not occur?

- How will mandated universal coverage change the way they do business?

- What are their main strategies to reduce costs?

- What books would they recommend on the subject of health systems?

I'm writing a book, and one of the characters is mauled on the arm by a tiger.  I'm trying to figure out what kind of injury he could sustain that would cause him to completely lose the use of that arm, but not so severe that the arm would have to be amputated.  I don't even know if that's possible, but that's part of the reason why I'm asking.

I would assume that the best candidate for such an injury would be nerve damage, so that the blood flow isn't interrupted, but the arm can't be used anymore.

Sorry if this is a stupid question.  Also, if there's somewhere else that I could post this that would be more relevant, please let me know!  :)",20,8,2013-03-08,PHARMA,0.06435752660036087,0.8967835307121277,0.038859009742736816

Did they get ""phased out"" by corporate to bring in shiny new (and cheaper) replacements?   
Did they leave before retirement due to physical limitations (standing that long kills my knees and I'm in my 20s)?  
Did they leave because maybe they finally snapped at some schmuck who wanted to know why it takes 15 minutes to ""slap a sticker on a box""?

Health,Can anybody that has had chronic problems from heat exhaustion give me guidance on how long it will take to fully recover?,"I had heat exhaustion (perhaps heat stroke depending on how you define it) this past July and I still haven't fully recovered. About 5 hours before it happened I took a small dose of prescription adderal (10mg) and I think it may have contributed to my heat exhaustion. I nearly passed out, but I didn't and was able to get to a cool place and get water within about a minute or two. I drank so much water the rest of the day that I was 13 pounds heavier before I went to bed. Until about September I was drinking 20-30 bottles of water a day and I had acute pain at times in my kidney area and I consistently had general soreness in my upper back, neck, and back of my head. Also, I couldn't tolerate being in the sun for more than a few minutes and I couldn't exercise because I would become quickly fatigued and the soreness in my spinal cord area would get worse. Starting in October things started to get much better and I was able to start exercising and drinking coffee and alcohol again (both had made my symptoms worse for the first few months). By this past January I was feeling pretty normal except I was still sensitive to the heat and sun ( e.g. It was 0 degrees one day in January but it was very sunny out so I still turned the air conditioner on in my car because the sun heating up the interior of my car was still not tolerable). Altogether though, January was a good month for me as I was drinking normal amounts of water and not having any soreness... Then in early February I had a recurrence of my symptoms from just walking briskly around a mall with a very warm coat on for about a half hour. I started to realize I was getting really dehydrated so I got a few cups of water and some food and I thought I felt ok. The next day my symptoms started recurring and I continued to make it worse in the following days by constantly trying to ""tough it out"" and be active, drink alcohol etc. This led to my symptoms coming all the way back again in mid February. So for about the last 3 weeks I've been resting/not drinking coffee and alcohol and i'm slowly getting better. However I still I'm too sensitive to heat to take a hot shower now and when I open the oven and the heat hits my face it causes a rush of soreness (heat sensitivity) to occur in the back of my head and neck. My symptoms now are similar to what they were in the first few weeks following the initial incident in July. I can't really go out because if I walk around for more than 15 or 20 minutes I'll get fatigued and start drinking water excessively. The good news is that just like back in July I am slowly getting better everyday but I think it might take at least another month for me to get back to how I felt in January...



I have been to several doctors and done various tests (kidney ultrasound, blood tests, urine tests, ct scan, etc.) and everything checks out fine. The doctors don't really know what to tell me. They say to just lay off of caffeine/alcohol and stay away from heat and hopefully your body will eventually recover. I live in the Midwest so doctors around here don't really have a lot of experience treating patients with heat exhaustion... At this point I don't think think there is any way I'll be well enough to go outside in the sun this summer. I do intuitively feel like by the following summer I should be back to normal but I just don't know for sure...


Has anybody had a similar experience as me?

medicine,"IMA (nearly) 4th year medical student who is having difficulty with specialty selection and having second thoughts about a career in medicine in general. I am seeking advice, thoughts, or experiences from the good people of /r/medicine.","So, a little more background:
I am in a US MD program, and thus far, have had a fairly unremarkable track record.  I was middle of the pack for my USMLE step I, had zero honors during my first 2 years (yeah...i know), little substantial research experience/volunteering, and a handful of honors/high passes during my 3rd year.  I have no financial support from my family and have been funding my own education. Despite being one of the lucky few to get a nice scholarship, I will be leaving here with around $100k in debt.

Throughout my training, no specialties have really stood out to me above the rest, though each fell somewhere on the spectrum of intolerable to tolerable.  After much thought, I felt like anesthesia, IM, and emergency seemed like the best options for me (though my exposure to anesthesiology was for only 1 week), but I am going into my 4th year rotation-selection with very little conviction about my would-be career.  Part of me is not convinced that I want the life that a career as a practicing physician seems to offer.   

I am worried because the reasons that I decided to go into this field have been overshadowed by more negative experiences.  The aspects that I enjoy (getting to know patients, medical detective work, saving/changing lives) are a fraction of what has occupied me over the last year of my clinical training.  My ability to focus on the positives is dwindling and I am becoming overwhelmed by the hours/lack of sleep, the pressures around documentation/CYA, the highlighted systemic shortcomings, and the social exhaustion I feel from working from the bottom of the totem pole in a rigid hierarchical system.  

I watch the residents cope with their indentured servitude and see them struggle to pay for child-care that can accommodate their extreme hours. One intern guiltily remarked that he hadn't seen his kids in the last month because he is always gone before they awake and home after they are asleep.  I've watched marriages crumble, residents bitterly complain about how the maternity leave for one of their co-residents was forcing them to pick up the slack, and heard a new female attending (in her early 30s) anxiously describe how she feels obliged to continue to delay having children because the effects that it may have on her new practice. I recognize that this is in the setting of me being a male third-year, having no children (or even a willing incubator, for that matter), and practicing ""diet-doctoring,"" with significantly fewer patients/paperwork/responsibility. To top it off, I am rarely even reaching 80 hour/week duty hours.  

So... I am likening myself to a guy who is complaining of blisters during the first mile of an ultra-marathon.  Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?  Or is my training designed to increase my comfort in knowing that I am not in a tunnel, rather on a never-ending subterranean highway, and I should be grateful that I may go from 80 hr/wk to 60?  

So, are there any anesthesiologists, IM docs, ED docs willing to talk about their careers, and the factors they weighed most heavily in deciding on specialty to select?  Are there any medical people who have had cold feet during their training?  Anybody out there who took the debt from getting an MD degree but didn't pursue a residency or clinical practice?

TL;DR: Naive MS3 whines about medicine, is undecided about his career, and wants to hear from meddit about cold-feet and career selection.

Health,I can't breath!!,"I've been suffering from a stuffed nose ever since I caught a cold 6 months ago. I got over the cold, but not the stuffed nose. I sneeze between 20 - 25 times a day, my nose constantly runs, and I can't breath unless I'm outside. 

When I'm in my office, I can't breathe. My nose is so stuffed, that it sounds like I constantly have a cold. I sneeze every 15 minutes, which in turn gives me headaches, and i've probably gone through 12 boxes of kleenex since day 1. 

It gets worse at night. I can't sleep because I can't breathe. I don't like to breathe through my mouth for many reasons: I get dehydrated easier, my mouth is dry, and I can't swallow.. it's very uncomfortable and it disturbs my sleep. I just want to be able to breathe through my nose again! 

Can someone please explain, or even recommend something? I can't take this anymore. 

side note: i sleep with a window open and fan on to encourage fresh airflow in my bedroom at night.

I keep telling him to **talk to the pharmacist**, but he just won't listen! Even after he wound up in the hospital with a drug-drug interaction a few years back. He's relying on the multiple prescribers to keep it all straight for him. Makes me crazy!

I've decided I'm going to stop by his pharmacy with him the next time I go to visit and have him set up an appointment for a medication review. Before he winds up in the hospital again :(",13,17,2013-03-24,PHARMA,0.0460474006831646,0.9119807481765747,0.04197179153561592
Health,Reddit convinced me to see a doctor after reading about DVT's... life saved!,"As the heading infers, I went to the doctor after reading a post on reddit, and was diagnosed with a DVT in my left calf and a small pulmonary embolism in my right lung. In fact,  I am currently in the hospital wiring this up from my bed. 

 If not for reddit, I may have attributed my inflamed calf muscle to joint pain that comes from my crohns disease. I have had knee and leg issues for years,  and probably would have tried to push through the pain and waited for the swelling to go down. It may have taken me much longer to see a doctor about it and, in hindsight, it might have killed me.

My name is Steve and I am a nurse who has an idea!  I am in the process of building a ""medical watch"".   This watch would have the benefit of containing several features that cater directly to medical professionals like myself.  I am looking for some feedback from other nurses out there to get an idea of how useful this watch might be for medical professionals.  Let me know what you think.

This watch would be a digital watch with many of the standard features like alarm clocks and timers.  However, this watch would also include an LED flashlight for quick neuro checks, measurements on the wristband for fast wound length estimation, a metronome for CPR compression rhythm, and a counter to track heart rate and respirations-per-minute. The default display would be in 24 hour format with easily readable date.

Does this sound like something medical professionals would be interested in?  Does this sound like over kill for features? What are your thoughts?

Thanks,

(I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub to post in.)","I'm just a paramedic, so I am in no way qualified to tell him that he may have a life-threatening genetic disorder.  On the other hand, if he does have Marfan Syndrome, he might not be diagnosed until it's too late.


Here's some background:

He's 25, tall and lanky with a very narrow face, and eyes that angle downward away from his nose.  He's approximately 205 cm with an incredibly long wing span.  (I don't know exactly how long, but his fingertips extend to his mid-thighs when standing.)  His joints are hyper-mobile. He can bend his fingers almost all the way back.  His fingers also appear to be disproportionately long for his hands.  


He wears contacts to correct an astigmatism. 


Medical hx: acute idiopathic pancreatitis  4 months ago, infrequent severe headaches, and insomnia.  He also often complains about achy joints, and once asked my if it was possible to have arthritis in his hips at such a young age.

Meds: 10 mg Zolpidem.

He mentioned to me once that he thinks he has infrequent heart palpitations, but hasn't seen a doctor for it.

No family hx of sudden cardiac death.  His father and two uncles have both had surgery to correct detached retina.  
He has had one normal EKG while in the ED for the pancreatitis, but has never had an echo.

He is also somewhat of a hypochondriac, and I am reluctant to casually address this issue because I don't want to contribute to unnecessary anxiety about his health.

Am I out of line here?  My wife thinks I'm nuts, and insists that if there were a serious family medical condition it would have been diagnosed by now.  Should I just keep this to myself?",50,21,2013-03-27,PHARMA,0.12821446359157562,0.849711537361145,0.02207396924495697

I've heard of two companies - Guardian and the Standard - any other options out there?

By nature I am skeptical of insurance companies (that they will do everything in their power to not pay out) - should I be just as skeptical as disability insurance? Should I buy enough just to live on, or should I buy full replacement value of my future income?

How much can i expect to pay a month for this insurance (order of magnitude would be fine)?  

I'm pretty frugal - and my goal is to save/invest until I have enough passive income to retire on and work for fun if I'm still enjoying it.  I'd rather spend less on premiums and more on savings if I can (obviously can't now since I'm just starting out).

There was this on the news and I just wanted pharmacists opinion in this. It says some doctors say they are useless and dangerous. 

Personally I would disagree as to go so far to say they are useless. While I agree a change in diet and exercise is the best way to help reduce cholesterol statins can also be used temporarily to help. After all if the patient will keep eating unhealthy it is obvious that he will have to keep taking statins to keep his cholesterol in check and that will result in more side effects, also important to note that side-effects do not affect everyone the same.

I posted this here mostly because there wasn't any mention of the pharmacists opinion and everything was said by doctors.

Health,Casual smoking - how bad is it?,"This has always been an interesting question to me, most surveys or articles seem to use their baseline as a pack-a-day smoker, which seems like a fair bit (25 cigarettes every day).

A lot of people seem to now just smoke while drinking, i.e. they might go through 2 packets on a weekend but then have 5 days where they do not smoke at all, or alternatively instead of that, they might have a single cigarette/cigar after dinner each night as a treat.

Obviously this isn't doing anyone any good, but what's the deal with this as opposed to heavy smoking, is it the same as having having 1 glass of wine per night vs. drinking 2 bottles every night? Can smoking in moderation not have too much of an effect on your body?

Most of the articles I looked up on this go into tangents about how casual smoking can turn into 'full time', but I know a huge amount of people these days who've been casual smokers for years and don't touch cigarettes (or even have access to them) during the working week.

Edit: I should add that I'm looking at this from a scientific position, I think we all agree any amount of smoking will do damage, but how do the risks change from someone who has 2 smokes a day vs. a pack a day vs 2 packs a day ?",43,48,2013-03-31,PHARMA,0.03275177627801895,0.9318095445632935,0.035438671708106995

Health,What's wrong with me? Anxiety/ dizzyness,"Does anyone have suggestions or can relate to me? The past couple of weeks I will wake up in the night with heart racing, sometimes my body is shaking, slightly uncomfortable feeling in my throat and brain (not really headaches, but dizzy and I ""can't think"" like i have a concussion but I haven't hit my head.)

I felt this way and actually went to the emergency room and they ran ekg tests, thyroid tests, tested blood for any infections, and said I seemed to be OK just having panic attacks but to follow up with the doctor. They also prescribed me ativan which I take when I'm starting to stress and then go to sleep... but it feels like something else besides stress. So I'm about to go to the doctor but worried they'll just tell me the same.

It started after I had a minor sore throat/ congestion which cleared up but I still felt weird and dizzy. Gets worse when I drink or smoke cigarettes to the point where I won't smoke anymore, it makes me feel too weird. Basically I just feel dizzy and ""out of sorts"" like when you feel sudden blood loss in a part of your body. Also I have a lot of stressors going on my life, but I'm never consciously thinking about them when it happens. Like, i'll wake up at night and my body is ""panicking""

Could this be some weird allergies? Are these stroke symptoms? Can anyone relate or suggest what to do?

**EDIT**
I am going to see a doctor this week, armed with some more information. Since I posted (basically last night) I had the added symptom of phantasomia- basically for about a minute I thought I smelled rotten eggs and the smell wasn't there. I thought I had the same thing last week with the smell of fresh bread. Either way this is sometimes linked to sinus infection or brain tumor. So I am going to find out hopefully on monday or tuesday what's going on with me. Discussing it online though has helped a lot and given me some ideas- first of all, that i'm not crazy and it might be a legit health problem. So I'm going to the doctor to try and figure it out.
