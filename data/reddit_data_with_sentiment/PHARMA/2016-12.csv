Examples I have seen within this group of Medditors include users  /u/MRItopMD discussing his introduction of mathematics to his daily interventional radiology practice, /u/hagarwal developing a medical checklist app and a primary care doc who spent one month monitoring his time spent on non-clinical tasks to improve productivity.

medicine,It's cold &amp; flu season once again!,"In an effort to try my very best to NOT contribute to the over usage of antibiotics (namely everyone's favorite z-pack ""just in case I have bronchitis""), I already had a semi-tense discussion today laced with the ""does this idiot know what the heck she is talking about"" look as to why a cough of 3 days doesn't need antibiotics. 

• I understand the concern and even the general distrust that the public seems to have with the medical system (missed diagnoses, system is overburdened, Dr. Google advised otherwise, etc.). 

• I get that you're sitting in front of me and you paid a co-pay and getting back here to see me again will be a serious drag and you will hate me with the fire of a thousand suns if you do actually get worse and I did nothing but tell you to rest, hydrate and use OTC medications. 

• I get that your co-worker has the same exact illness and is already on a Z-pack, prednisone and an albuterol inhaler. 

• I get that we are taking a small risk by asking you to wait it out a week or so and let the virus run its course.  

... And I'm not winning any Pres Ganey points by saying no ... so, goodbye bonus! ...

medicine,Discussing code status - What's your spiel?,"Hi there. Medicine intern here.

One thing I've been thinking I need to refine a lot is my discussion of code status with patients, especially at time of admission. Right now, when I ask patients about it, it usually goes like this:

""Now, I have somewhat more serious questions to ask you, and please do not be alarmed. These are questions I ask all of my patients when they come into the hospital.
If, god forbid, anything were to happen and your heart were to stop, would you wish for us to do all we can do bring you back, including chest compressions and electrical shocks?
If, god forbid, your breathing were to stop, would you want us to place a tube down your airway and place you on a ventilator to assist your breathing?""

I've run into a few problems with my approach namely:
1) Sometimes people look at me all baffled and say ""OF COURSE DO EVERYTHING WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT"" even when their condition honestly calls for deep consideration of these questions.
2) Some people seem very averse to the idea of intubation and ventilators, but are totally fine with CPR. So I end up with these people wanting to be DNI, but not DNR...Which my attendings have told me is not really an acceptable code status.

One of my palliative care attendings worded it this way:
""If your heart were to stop or your breathing were to stop, would you like to die a natural death or die on machines?""
Granted, this approach did make people more likely to elect for DNR/DNI, but I feel really icky about it, because it seems to be a leading question in a way. Who honestly wants to die on machines vs a natural death?

I guess I want to know, how do you experienced doctors of meddit have a frank, earnest discussion to establish code status on your patients, regardless of the severity of their condition? I want to have a good way to talk to them about it that is thoughtful, sensitive and yet has them make an intelligent, informed decision. And I feel like a lot of patients probably don't fully understand the implications of what ""doing everything"" means, even when given the standard explanations.

Forgive me in advance if this sounds like a really stupid question.",51,106,2016-12-02,PHARMA,0.04934854805469513,0.9259065985679626,0.024744905531406403

Upon reading the comments, it appears there is some controversy surrounding the actual name of the song and composer. The OP of this video states that he has the song title listed as such simply because that's what most people think it is...but admits that people really aren't sure. So I did some more internet searching, and it seems the BEST answer was from a YAHOO ANSWERS post (of all things) from 8 years ago, saying that it is this [song](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Liebestraum+in+A+flat+Major) . Now, neither of these videos song exactly the same to me, but I am no music buff so maybe they are the same song, just played differently.

It's funny how a ton of the comments are from people raving about how great the composition is. Yet, it resonates with most of us as the work of the devil.

medicine,Struggling PGY2 looking for life and career advice,"I am a US grad pediatrics PGY2. I have dealt with mild depression &amp; generalized anxiety my entire life. I am objectively an above average resident based on test scores and clinical knowledge. But my whole life I've struggled with feelings of inadequacy (as some of you might relate to). Therefore I've always been somewhat work averse and always struggle to get myself into work or to study. As a PGY2 this work aversion has been getting much worse, especially with the onset of 28hr shifts. I am not fulfilled by my work enough to motivate me through the rigorous hours this year. I grin &amp; bear it, but my anxiety &amp; depression have been worsening. The hours and the detraction from my quality of life have been soul crushing. I am on an SSRI and seeing a counselor. 

People tell me they deal with the horrible hours because they ""love their job"", and this scares me, because I can't relate with them. I feel ashamed because I WANT to feel that way, but the hours prevent that. I love the academic parts of medicine and teaching, but hate the hours and the unrelenting stream of stress that goes with them. 

Lately I am scared for my future because I don't know where my career will end up. I want to stay in medicine, and am considering general outpatient peds vs hospitalist. My dream job would be teaching (ie at a med school) but this is apparently hard to set up. I would consider getting more heavily into research if possible. I want to have manageable hours with a good quality of life.

I'm not posting here to be told to quit residency, so please don't tell me that; I obviously muse about it every day, but I enjoy my work overall (if I only had to do it 8 hrs/day), and I have invested too much time and money to go back. I want to hear from like-minded residents who were able to grind through residency, and if it got better or not. What strategies do you use to make it through? How do you motivate yourself through 28+hr shifts? What creative career options have you heard of for people that don't pursue clinical medicine (ie administration, insurance jobs, pharma, Step 1 prep teaching, undergrad teaching, etc)? What stories have you heard about people who quit and what did they go on to do? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks all. 

tl;dr: I enjoy my work but the long hours are making my life miserable, I don't want to quit but rather am looking for advice from people who dealt with disliking their job, and advice for future careers both in and out of medicine.",64,129,2016-12-04,PHARMA,0.12699079513549805,0.8450856804847717,0.027923528105020523

I expected to have been adjusted by now to the work but I am not and frankly, I don't foresee myself being happy doing this line of work for the rest of my career.

Luckily, the silver lining is that because of lower tuition in Canada and my having worked throughout my years of university in addition to the savings I've accumulated from these months of work - I am debt free. Hence, I am hoping to hear from former pharmacists who have moved on from this profession and your stories.

What are you doing now and are any of the skills you learned as a pharmacist still useful for your current line of work? How did you transition into another career?

In a busy medical center, how long should it take for a surgeon's dictation to appear in an EMR? How long should it take the generic EMR surgery form to show up in the EMR? 

My team's patient had two surgeries yesterday afternoon. As of 5PM today, there was still no real note for either one. Surgery #2 has a very brief 1 day post-op note but no dictation about what the surgeons found intraoperatively. I was lucky that I caught the resident walking by or I would have just gestured at the patient this morning and said, ""There are bandages on him. That's...probably surgery?"" 

I don't know if it's common, but one of my rotations had a pretty trivial fill-in-the-blank form that was immediately completed at the end of surgery with things like preliminary diagnosis and EBL. The surgeon's dictation got stuck in no less than 12 hours later. In this hospital, my only procedure clue might be the anesthesia notes.

medicine,Memories of the Dissection Hall,"Hiking along the path right from the creaky wooden benches of the Lecture Theatre to the dark indoors of the Dept of Anatomy, we used to reach the Dissection Hall after three lengthy sleep inducing lectures which used to test our patience to the fullest. If we were to start dissecting the Abdomen that day, then as per my teacher's say I’d to give the initial few pages of Cunningham, the dissection manual, a read.

It’d been three months and by now we’d grown quite friendly with my co-students on the dissection table with a few table parties and lots of truth and dares and dumb charades which we played when extreme dissection started to piss us off. We celebrated our birth days or success in any part completion test, partying out hard. Also we grew quite familiar with our female cadaver, who probably heard almost everything we discussed in secret. Altogether our dissection table including me had 3 guys and 7 girls with surprisingly all genius minds. If there was a test, a scholarship programme, a sports event or any academic enterprise, one of the participants had to be from my dissection table.

I remember the first few days of dissection.

‘HERE THE DEAD ENLIGHTENS THE LIVING’ said a rusty yellow iron board outside Dissection Hall at its entrance. Facing a dead human body right in front of you was always a haunt. Before joining Medical College, dissection was one of my worst fears as I’d seen Munna Bhai faint out of frenzy on holding the scalpel in his hand like a pen. The first day when we were allotted our table and lockers, the bodies had their shrouds on. We were gradually mentally prepared for the big task ahead-that of dissection of course. The other day I almost had a goose’s skin when the shrouds were jerked off the bodies to reveal what it carried inside-a dead fat human female in her mid fifties with all four limbs intact, un-dissected and fresh.

As months would roll by, she would gradually impart to us what the anatomies of the human body were and eventually get dismantled limb after limb, organ after organ. The memory I have of her this day, four years post dissection is merely that of a limbless torso, skull sawed and brain removed; chest cage ripped apart at the breast bone and the heart and lungs dismembered leaving a gaping cavern. Her face is another undying memory with her jaw half open revealing a neat line of teeth with two or three missing members, the skin of her face drawn tight against the underlying facial bones giving her a curious, grinning expression. There were ten bodies for a hundred of us, being assigned ten to one per table.

All the cadavers had been duly processed before being provided to us for dissection and the processing had left them no different from the bunch of roses left to dry under the sun - Black, Stiff, Motionless and Hideous.

The daze of seeing the cadaver for the first time was distracted by the harsh, pompous voice of Dr Rohatagi who wanted to get done with taking the roll call of a hundred freshers number by number. We were expecting to be guided about the maiden approach towards studying the cadavers but we were in for a major misunderstanding. ‘All....open your Cunningham's manuals....start reading. Page one to six’ was all we were worthy of according to Dr Rohatagi on our first day in medical college.

But it was an experience! Five students on each side of the cadaver, not being able to raise our heads and look around to evaluate the equally scared peers as to have a good look at the still bodies on the cold steel table before us. Yet gradually one by one by referring from the books, we got the real first glimpse of the inside of our cadavers making us even more inquisitive.

And I must confess that the first three pages of the manual were the toughest comprehension passages I had ever read. Medial, Sagital, Coronal, Axial were all as Latin or German in pronunciation as in comprehension. The description of movements as Abduction, Adduction, Flexion, Circumduction and Extension added to the mounting tension. Surely, reading the first few pages was treacherous for someone who had just eighty two percent in English in the twelfth standard.

If you thought that the dissection began from the head and completed with the toe, you are wrong. We started with the lower limb, proceeded to the upper and then to the Thorax and Breast-all in a disorderly order!

The first few days we wore rubber gloves which we got from Dispensary Road, Dehradun but they were either too large or too small and since our seniors hadn’t been using them in 15 years, we too decided to go bare handed.

The funda of doing well in dissection was simple-pay attention in class, read the dissection from Cunningham before handed and keep your patience till you finally search what you wanted.

As we dissected the palm, we were expected to identify the Palmer Aponeurosis, the Fascia Reticularis, the Median Nerve and many other bigger tongue twisters. Thus seeing or imagining the structures that were being dissected, I found myself staring at people's palms in all public places-the Daily Needs shop, the Library, the Royal Mess and even Nescafe. But the next week when the time table on the notice board said ‘Dissection-The Breast’, I was rather scared. Imagine staring at lemons, oranges and water melons in public!

No medical student can ever recall a dissection theatre without the pervasive formalin. It is this acrid liquid that caused a lot of trouble in the initial days. Our cadaver was extra fatty so fat and formalin formed a really deadly pungent combo and we could smell it everywhere-during food, during writing or even playing Table Tennis.

However, looking back today, I realize there were so many untaught, but naturally learnt lessons in those ten months of dissection. Dissection taught me perseverance. We had to understand the intricacies of the human body before getting down to dissecting it. Understanding the greater sac and lesser sac, arguing about the cornea and sclera, and discussing the formation of the arches-all contributed to cracking the mystery of the body bit by bit. If the concept was not clear, then any amount of dissection could not show us what we wanted to see. THE EYES DO NOT SEE WHAT THE MIND DOES NOT KNOW.

And the greatest, most important lesson for the life of a doctor- respect for the human body. We owe it to those corpses who lay patiently tutoring us the marvels of the Creation, the beauty of the architecture and reverence to the most awe inspiring creation of God-the Human body!

pharmacy,"Pharmacist just got someone $1,000 worth of meds for $15. Crazy!","#TL;DR: Pharmacist worked intuition and magic to get a manufacturer drug coupon to cover over $1,000 worth of a non-formulary medication. 

I know most pharmacists don't seem to put patient co-pays at the very top of their lists of concerns, but helping a patient save money when it's both really difficult to save that money (rare or exclusive coupons) AND they're in a difficult financial situation is the stuff I live for. 

We had an older lady (a regular) come in to fill her Amrix right before closing today, and her new job's insurance was rejecting it as non-formulary. It's Thursday, her doc is out till Monday anyways, and her out of pocket cost for 4 caps with our discount card was like $135. Lady ended up opting only to get 2 pills for $67 cause she couldn't afford it and would just deal with the pain on her own indefinitely. 

Normally my pharmacist doesn't like me burning time on trying to find a coupon with a patient, so I mention I know Teva had an Amrix coupon, she should consider looking it up, and I was going to leave it there. But she said didn't have a computer, then the pharmacist chimed in that she knew about the coupon, pulled it up, and let me sign her up(type it and everything) on a whim. 

Coupon rejected, says it only works with commercial insurance, so we ran the coupon as a secondary, bypassed primary's TPR, then coupon rejected and said it had a 14 tablet min.

I figured that the coupon would have a coverage cap of $350 *at best* and was ready to go just go back and sell her the 2 caps for $67. But RPh said just run it for 14 caps and bypass primary,I did, and it came out to just $15 out of pocket! I was like what!? Run that shit for 30.

So we did, and even with the primary completely rejecting, the coupon covered all 30 brand-name caps for a grand total of *$968.17*, leaving her with a $15 copay. Teva gave this lady $1K in medicine even though they only got $15 for it. 

No joke the lady cried. Best thing I've witnessed in recent memory.

And I might as well ask - anyone else know of other coupons like this? That work even if primary rejects and have no maximum coverage?",34,46,2016-12-09,PHARMA,0.09708162397146225,0.8772779703140259,0.02564041130244732

This Doctor works his ass off going to 4+ different hospitals builds business by seeing them as outpatient when they become D/C. About 5 years ago he was in practice with another MD. Then they hired another MD. I would say each MD has about 10 NP or PA working. The doc does the initial assessment then the PA and NP take it from there. 

&gt; So my question is is their a limit on how many NP and PA's you can hire? 

&gt; Why did he hire two more psychiatrists? Could it be overbearing for him or are you allowed to have more PA and NP's as long as their is more MDs?

I'm not sure what to do here. Should I bring in a scientific paper tomorrow (any one of thousands) that proved chemotherapy works?

medicine,Tough day at work in the hospital. Just want to vent.,"I am a relatively newbie a doctor who has recently started working in ED. I like to think that I try my best for my patients and try and be patient, even with the ones who are obviously looking to complain, or the anxious ones who think they have everything wrong with them. Normally I take my job as stressful but manageable, but today I've had an experience which really upset me. Tried my best for a patient and had no support whatsoever from the medical registrar, who also told me that I had done nothing for my patient (who was very sick) and that I was completely wasting his time asking him what to do. He then hung up on me mid-sentence.

I guess it's nothing new in medicine, to be hounded, stressed and feel like a piece of shit, especially in the ED. As I say, i'm usually quite tough with the job and am quite used to going home late, but there is only so much a person can take before they reach the end of their tether. I went home 1 and a half hours late, trying to hide the tears building up in my eyes, with a still poorly patient, feeling like I'd done absolutely nothing for them and as though my 6 years of training and my 2 years working as a doctor have just amounted to me being deemed useless.",13,24,2016-12-17,PHARMA,0.2753639221191406,0.6987341642379761,0.02590191923081875

Psych is starting to look very attractive to me, as they have better hours, and don't have to deal with the stress that comes with the OR and dealing with Surgeons. I am really considering switching, but the only thing keeping me is the hope that Pain, and OB Anesthesia will make it worth it. Any advice would be appreciated.

medicine,"EMS- 72 year old female, left sided tongue swelling.","This was a bizarre case I had yesterday and I was hoping to see if anyone knows what was going on.

72 year old female calls 911 for tongue swelling. Over the course of the call and transport to the hospital, which was about 20 minutes, her tongue was definitely even more swollen. She had trouble talking due to the swelling. The tongue was only swollen on the left side and by the time we reached the hospital, it was almost sticking out of the mouth. No hives, vitals WNL.

Only history of HTN, takes amlodipine and stopped lisinopril 3 weeks ago. My paramedic told me that he has seen this with patients on ACE inhibitors before, like lisinopril, but the patient's are usually currently on the medication, which was not the case with this patient.

Management included IV diphenhydramine and gunning to the hospital because he really didn't want to cric her. 

So, what would cause this presentation? Could it still be the ace inhibitor even if she hasn't taken it in months? Why would it only be on one side of the tongue? How is this managed in the hospital, because the attending at the ED stated that benedryl usually doesn't fix the problem and I think she stated it's just a waiting game and hope that the patient's airway doesn't get occluded, but then why not nasally intubate?",37,101,2016-12-18,PHARMA,0.10042281448841095,0.8713296055793762,0.028247641399502754

My latest type 1 came into the ICU with DKA (gap 34, pH 7.07), fixed him up, placed on regular diet, no glucose issues x 2 days on his regular insulin dosing, but one day on the floor and he's back on a diabetic diet with a glucose of 53.  

I started using ""regular diet- no concentrated sweets"" and none of my patients have had hypoglycemic events(sliding scale in place, rarely used).

pharmacy,"Changing of the Guard at Mineral Pharmacy in Superior, Montana","My father started working as a pharmacist 41 years ago here in Montana. He spent his first stint in Missoula at Osco. In a bold move for him, he decided after a good number of years to purchase an independent pharmacy in Superior, an hour away and move us all out there in 1991. My brother and I were 2 and 3 at the time.


Even though the community hasn't grown much, he managed to grow the daily Rx output of the store to today one customer at a time. I remember spending most of my days after school hanging out at the store and my brother and I both spent a good amount of time working there.

I learned a lot from dad, and he never regretted coming down to a rural community and being his own boss at an independent pharmacy. You get to know, over 25 years, the customers like it's a family.

The business itself is the only pharmacy in the county (nearest is 52 miles away) and has only had 3 different owners in over 80 years of existence.

Anyway, the only constant being change in this world, dad is 65 and finally making a well deserved shift to look towards retirement next year. So the business will be up for sale.

My mom and dad have been looking the normal routes, but something that is important to them is giving the opportunity for another pharmacist to do what we did. So I figured I would post here.

It seems that providing supportive care (e.g. lots of fluids, NSAID - decongestant combos like DayQuil, bed rest, tissues etc.) would be the order of the day instead of breaking out the big gun anti-virals.

medicine,Question about the limits of an EMT,"Hey meddit. Long time lurker first time poster here. I'm writing here today after suffering a horrific case of culture shock and was wondering if what I witnessed was something that is the norm. 

Today I had the extremely unfortunate case of having to give a relative cpr at Xmas dinner. The man in question had an extensive history of diabetes (had a bka and dramatically reduced mobility) and heart disease. He was found unconscious after an unknown period of time. 

An ABC assessment showed he had no signs of life so I commenced CPR, I rotated between myself and another man who I taught on the fly because I had previously been swimming and I was pretty fucked from that. Bystander CPR continued for 13 minutes before the EMTs arrived. 

Now here is where things got over my head. Three EMTs (I don't know what levels they were but 2 of them looked pretty shaken at the sight of a dead guy)  take over. The most senior feels a carotid pulse for less than 10 seconds. He then stands up, tells his colleague to stop and announces the man is dead. He says there is nothing more they could do and that the next appropriate step would be to call the police and following that a funeral service. 

This scenario occurred in Peru. As a UK trained doctor I couldn't believe my eyes and ears. I watched in horror as they packed up their bags and got back in their ambulance and drove away. 

I've never seen the prehospital side of an arrest before so I didn't know if this was a normal thing.

So after that wall of text, my question is this: what is the limit of roles and responsibility of an EMT in your country and are you able to stop the ALS algorithm without a doctor?",67,74,2016-12-26,PHARMA,0.14738571643829346,0.8230794072151184,0.029534921050071716

Medicine resident here, currently rotating through a service where I'm basically an order-entering, consult-calling monkey. 

Trying not to make this too obvious but basically got this super old dude who the surgeons actually WANTED to take to the OR for a procedure, and somehow the guy got admitted to medicine for ""preop workup"" of a non-existent GI bleed. So we rule out this non-existent GI bleed, except my attending thinks this guy is too high risk for surgery due to his other medical stuff. Except instead of saying this, she goes around having me order test after test, consult after consult, FISHING for a reason to stop this procedure from happening. Consult after consult agrees that this dude has a lot of co-morbidities, but consistently say that while high risk ok to proceed with procedure. So finally finally finally after like 3-4 days of wasting time and doing a bunch of rando tests that she talks the consulting services into recommending (one service was even like wtf this is not a thing we do), everybody signs off on the surgery happening. And everything's all hunky dory and everybody's happy, and the patient's NPO at midnight and after everybody goes home SHE TEXTS SAYING NO WAIT WE NEED TO CONSULT THIS OTHER SERVICE THEY THINK PATIENT IS TOO HIGH RISK FOR PROCEDURE.

I'm so mad. Like FINE you don't think the patient should have surgery. SO THEN JUST SAY THAT. If you're going to be fucking paternalistic about this whole thing, why the hell did we do all these tests and waste everybody's times and moneys when the management's not going to change?? The family gets that this is a high risk procedure that could leave the dude debilitated, but they're willing to take the chance because they think this could really improve the patient's quality of life and if he doesn't get the procedure he'll be debilitated anyways.

I can't. I'm so sick of this cover-your-ass garbage. All we do at this hospital is order tests that won't change management and waste peoples' time and money.
