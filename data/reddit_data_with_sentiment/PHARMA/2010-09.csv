Health,"Hey /r/health, I look terrible, feel terrible; going to do something about it.","So a couple years ago I took up bike riding, at my peak I was riding about 300 miles in a month and lost an insane amount of weight, like 50 lbs. Since then I've kinda fallen back into my old self, I'm about 15 pounds from my peak weight from back in the day. I used to feel hopeless but the bicycling experience taught me that all my other conspiracy theories about *what* I was eating didn't effect my weight nearly as much as just my total lack of regular exercise.

I think I could lose some of the weight by eating *less* but I have a really stretched out stomach so that's harder to do than I'd like to admit. Also, I'm starting to think it's better just to eat what you like and get lots of exercise than to not eat what you like and not get lots of exercise. So I'm going to try to go back to the bicycling regularly thing.

Food for thought though ... what is a healthy lifestyle like? Who has time for regular exercise and home-cooked meals in this modern society? What kind of jobs do they do for a living? How do they have time for things like having children and crap? I'm anti-stress to the core and I've been through the mental health circus so I know that skinny people aren't necessarily healthy people, hard working people aren't necessarily happy people, etc ... I really feel like I should only be working a couple hours of the day and spend the rest of time eating well, exercising and just ... living!

I'm tired of being glued to my chair and really tired of not looking my best. At least I know there's hope, I'm guessing a lot of people don't.",15,7,2010-09-12,PHARMA,0.14837290346622467,0.8227244019508362,0.02890274114906788

Health,"Can't get rid of my acne, please help?","Hi, thanks for reading.  I'm 21 and have terrible skin and it's really killing my self-esteem.  Since my teenage years I assumed it would clear up but it hasn't improved at all.

I have been to the dermatologist and they prescribed very heavy pills for me to attack the more common bacterial causes of acne, and of course this didn't improve things one bit.

I'm thinking that it might be hormonally related and was wondering if anyone would have any advice.  PMS causes at least 3-5 really large, deep, painful lumps that last for at least a week.  This is in addition to many pimples and blackheads all over that also get worse during PMS and throughout MS.  I also suffer from dry skin so I don't know if that makes it worse. I have extremely good hygiene so I've been getting really frustrated.  I wash, exfoliate, change pillow cases and sheets, etc.  I will still get the occasional boil/cyst at random times.

My skin also is very sensitive and slow to heal, so if I do finally get fed up and pop one it scabs for 2+ weeks, so it's like I'm perpetually stuck with either active or scabbed acne on my upper arms, face, neck, chest, back, and upper legs/bum. I also have very mild eczema.

Thank you so much for any suggestions.  I'm considering getting a hormone imbalance test.  I tried the pill for a while but that still didn't prevent it and turned my moods very angry.   I'm also looking at diet adjustments (though I already am very healthy).  

Basically it just seems like my skin is always unhappy though I try to do my best.


Edit: I only drink water, hot tea, coffee, and gatorade or all natural fruit juice,  I don't eat processed food if possible.  I exercise often.  I use neutrogina face wash 2x a day and an astringent in between.",87,29,2010-09-21,PHARMA,0.218125581741333,0.7491231560707092,0.0327511727809906

Health,I'm becoming increasingly convinced that the Paleolithic diet is the way to go.  Thoughts?,"[Paleolithic diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet): a 
nutritional plan based on the presumed diet of wild plants and animals ancestral humans habitually consumed during the Paleolithic Era. ""Centered on commonly available modern foods, the ""contemporary"" Paleolithic diet consists mainly of meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, roots, and nuts; and excludes grains, legumes, dairy products, salt, refined sugar, and processed oils.""

Basically, the idea is to only eat foods that human bodies evolved to consume over the last several million years (before the advent of agriculture ~10,000 years ago).",15,13,2010-09-23,PHARMA,0.02649725042283535,0.9318299293518066,0.04167279973626137

Think pixel-sized red/yellow/light-burn (from starting at a bright light/reflection) that move rapidly.

medicine,"I new to this subreddit, but there's just something I need to know.","I don't know how many of you here are medical doctors or medical students, but I'd like somebody to give me an honest, candid opinion of the medical profession as it stands today.  Nearly everything I've read online about medical school and becoming an MD has said in so many words that it drains one's life.  I've read about doctors having high divorce rates, brutally long work hours, and lower life expectancies.  And conversely, I've encountered far fewer positive opinions of the lives of medical professionals.  So I'd like to know if this is true.  I want to be clear that I'm not trying to belittle the achievements of doctors.  Rather, I'm questioning those who post articles about their lives being so dominated by their careers that the majority of them are unmarried or divorced, and too consumed by their work to maintain proper balance in their lives.  If you are doctor, does this accurately describe you?  Are most of you divorced/single and constantly stressed?  And how can anyone interested in medicine still desire to go for an MD after receiving such a deluge of discouraging information?  Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I really appreciate the comments, thank you.  I've been considering a career in medicine for awhile now, but have found many accounts online to be discouraging and deflating.
