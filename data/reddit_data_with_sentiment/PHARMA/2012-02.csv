Health,Desperately Need an Answer - Debillitating Condition,"I am at my wit's end trying to figure out the cause of this issue. Doctors have been unable to offer an effective explanation or treatment. So I now turn to Reddit as my last hope, and await the power of this great community of minds to shed some light on a possible diagnosis.

I have severe facial edema. It is located in my cheeks on both sides of my face. Both cheeks are swollen 24/7, although sometimes much worse than at others. I can feel the swelling and I constantly bite the inside of my mouth when I eat, which subsequently causes chronic ulcers. I have suffered this ailment for almost 10 years, with no signs of remission.

I am a 26 year old male and in very good shape. Excercise regularly and eat well. Like I said I have been suffering with this since my early teens - the swollen cheeks are not something I was born with.

Othe possibly relevant issues - hypothyroidism (currently under control with a dose to levothyroxine), and severe allergies (hay fever), although I have pretty much knocked them out with years of injections - now have almost zero symptoms all year long, Mild rosacea - kept under control with a mild face wash.

Causes of INCREASED swelling:
-Alcohol
-Hay Fever
-Olives/Olive Oil
-Coffee
-Spicy Foods
-Laying Down
-Sleeping
-Sugar
-Sweating
-exposure to water
-sunburn
-Smoking Cigarettes (I dont smoke, but when I have the occasional)

When exposed to any of these triggers the swelling is immensely worse - so bad that I do not like to go into public or interact with people. I do anyway, but it is getting more difficult every day to overcome the extreme level of self-consciousness this causes. I also cannot eat without biting the inside of my mouth.

Before you jump to a diagnosis involving some sort of allergic reaction, remember that the swelling is present even when I am not exposed to one of the triggers above. It is 24/7.

From the information I've gathered, It appears I may have an increased concentration of blood vessels in my face that are constantly engorged with blood? Or possibly a lymphatic system problem that does not allow the nodes in my face to properly drain? I am leaning toward the former (as I also have very mild rosacea), but I have no idea if this is a documented medical issue or is even treatable. It seems like a hypersensitive manifestation of a autoimmune reaction in my face, a reaction that I would otherwise never notice. I tried IPL numerous times with minimal results; the swelling would decrease slightly for a week then return in full force.

Hopefully someone out there will have an idea of what may be causing this and how I can treat it. Its absolutely ruining my life.

Thanks in advance Reddit!

Health,Just had my doctor tell me not to listen to nutrition or health advice from the internet unless it is on a site like pubmed.com,"He told me to cut back on my salt intake, even though the net is abuzz with the latest study showing salt is not bad for you.

Is it possible that health forums like this one are really hurting people more than they are helping?

Health,"My friend hit his head, got a decent gash, and a day later is feverish and puking. Are these related?","So on Friday a friend of mine tripped in the dark and hit his head on a bookshelf, which resulted in a decent gash (didnt get a good look at it but I'd say it was at least an in long, and looked fairly raw or like exposed tissue- more than just a nick or cut) and bleeding. He and I carpool to work , and once he got to work people told him to go to the hospital/go home. He went to the hospital, and the doctor said he ""should be fine"" after cleaning the wound. Now he's been throwing up all weekend and hasnt eaten anything since the day of the injury. He says he's been feeling feverish as well. Are these two related? If so, what could be the issue, and what should he do? He's a redditor as well, and I encouraged him to ask reddit about his injury but I don't believe he's been on since he's dealing with both a head injury and puking/fever. 

**UPDATE**
Thanks for all the replies and concerns. I've had sort of mixed responses and feelings about this thus far... As of yesterday he is back at work, not throwing up anymore, eating again, and he never went back to the hospital. He *seems* to be doing fine, and he SAYS he's fine, as does the doctor he went to at first and a couple of people with medical backgrounds. He seems to think that people are making a bigger deal out of it than it should be, though I do like erring on the side of safety. Anyway, just so you know, he's doing fine, though I am still on the lookout for any delayed after effects of the injury.

Health,For the people who suffer from Acne...,"Hi, Reddit

I had problems with Acne my whole life and I know many of you are in the same boat. I took Accutane for more than a year and although it was very effective I am not sure whether it messed up my immune system and joints (I am 27 and I have severe problems with both).
Besides, four years after the treatment I started getting pimples again. I almost went back to Accutane, but I visited a good Dermathologist and she prescribed me a great cream. It is called EPIDUO and the results I am getting with it are nothing less than amazing.

If you are considering Accutane, please try this cream before. You might get an initial breakout on the first week or 2 weeks, but afterwards the skin clears up gradually. I rarely get any pimples right now and I don't have any side effects whatsoever.

I just wanted to share my experience because I know many people are getting Accutane and if back then I had access to this cream I might have avoided putting so much toxics in my body.

I hope this helps somebody!",30,33,2012-02-07,PHARMA,0.036408159881830215,0.8855310082435608,0.0780608132481575

I got treatment, and it came back 2 more times before they increased the dosage and it went away. It came back about a month ago, and I sought treatment again. Went away again, but I was very careful, and it somehow has come back, despite my efforts.


My girlfriend and I have not had unprotected sex since my last round of antibiotics, and I have no STDs.


My symptoms:

-Yellow discharge from the penis.

-Stinging/Burning after urination

-Slightly cloudy and darker urine.

-Urine got tested, has some dead bits of flesh in it (Indicative of just about everything, the doc told me)

-When I press on my taint, gives a sharp pain in the whole urinary tract. I discovered this when I was lying down and my legs pinched that area.


Symptoms I don't have:

-Painful Kidneys/Bladder

-Swollen Kidneys/Bladder

-Painful erections.

-Painful orgasms.

-Blood in the urine (If I drink a few glasses of water, the urine returns to normal color).


My treatment so far has been Doxycycline and Metronidazole, because I am allergic to any -cillins and Sulfa drugs. The treatments have cleared up the symptoms for a time, and then they just keep coming back.


I would go to a urologist, but tbh, the closest one is two towns over, and I don't have health insurance. I can't afford the trip or the cost of seeing one without insurance. The doctors in my own town are ""country doctors"" who probably still think AIDS is transferred via homosexual intercourse. In other words, they don't know shit about modern medicine.


I'll be honest, reddit, I'm scared. One of these doctors I saw here brought up that ""I wasn't in the age group for kidney cancer""...But if that was running through his mind...I did a bunch of research, and I don't fit most of the symptoms, but I'm still really scared that this is something bigger than just re-occurring UTIs. I don't think they're supposed to stay with you, especially in males.


Can anyone help? I'm getting fairly desperate here, and I don't know what to do.


Thanks to everyone.

Health,"The docs on my area are clueless, reduced sensation in crotch, moderate pain ... anyone got some advice? Kinda LONG","Ill try to make this as brief as I possibly can.

Ive had some strange sensations in my groin and genital area for about a month. Went to regular doc and she said stress induced prostatitis, started me on 500mg naprosyn 2x day and doxycycline 100mg 2x day. Over 2 weeks things started to get better and I was able to return to the gym for some light exercise. 

Then on Thursday, I was driving home from class, and I felt myself getting an erection. Immediately, there was moderate pain through my groin, my penis shriveled up, and I lost some sensations. Felt like I couldn't sense needing to pee and had to force it to come out. However, there was no dribbling of urine before or after, other than that typical ""last drop."" My legs also got very weak and began to burn, more so in the thighs. I went to the closest ER and a urinalysis and CT scan was conducted. Everything they did came back normal. Urinalysis was clean. Blood work done 5 days earlier were spotless with only a minor increase in monocytes (11 on a 5-10 scale). Doc (actually a PA in conjunction with the doc) said acute prostatitis with acute unilateral sciatica from the prostatitis. He told me he wouldn't be doing a digital rectal exam as it can make it worse. I mentioned the pudendal nerve to the PA, and he looked completely clueless. I don't think he liked that I was questioning him. I left with a stronger antibiotic scrip to add to my current regimen. 

My current symptoms include minor perineal pain, hard to get/maintain an erection, reduced sensations, sciatica down the left leg that starts in the middle of my buttock. The lil' guy down south is hanging about half his normal size. The scrotum seems to be fully enervated and doesn't seem to have any diminished sensations. Sciatica is pretty static but it gets better when lying down, worse on standing. The other symptoms are generally worse when sitting, minor while standing, and laying down they come and go.

I am quite familiar with pudendal nerve issues as I had a friend who had temp. pudendal neuralgia from being a hardcore cyclist. I also had a single episode of ""crotch numbness"" when trying to take up cycling years ago, but I never rode again after that. The sensations I had then are not at all like the ones I am having now. I have, over the last year, done some major workouts on the stairclimber and the elliptical trainers as I was training to climb a mountain. So the movements didn't seem like they could cause the pudendal impingement. Since I am ""duck footed"" and have been my whole life, i considered piriformis syndrome. Then of course we still have prostatitis.

So it is a toss up between piriformis syndrome, pudendal neuralgia, acute non-bacterial prostatitis. But I am completely clueless and scared shitless, Im only 30 years old so the thought that I wouldn't have full use of my junk in the future terrifies me. I have an appt. for a urologist, but the place didn't have an opening for 2 months. I'm trying to decide if I should wait or find a specialist more suited for things like pudendal nerve involvement since most docs seem clueless on the topic.

Health,"Doctors of Reddit, please help.  I am scared.","The other night in bed I started feeling slight nausea and light-headed, clammy, and restless. Then last night after dinner, it hit me again, this time with strong fatigue. I went to Walmart and took my blood pressure. It was 141/80. I am between 25 to 29 years old. 

Immediately after taking my blood pressure, the symptoms increased. My breathing became heavy. I went over and sat down on a bench where my legs started to shake uncontrollably. The shaking spread over to my arms, chest, and feet. So I left Walmart, and could barely stand up right, much less walk back to the car. I was practically limping. My whole body was tense.

Went to the ER, the nurse registered my blood pressure at 146/87. I felt a very slight sharp pain near my sternum. This is when she calmed me down by telling me this bp is not unusually high. Also, she said that quitting smoking could be part of it, although I quit cold turkey over 3 weeks ago.

Waited to see the doctor who took my blood test.  My blood pressure dropped gradually to 112/72.  Tests came back fine.

WTF, I've never felt this way.  Why did I suddenly get hit by this wall of anxiety??  Does anxiety usually affect people this way?  I'm scared because I fear there is an underlying problem the doctors are unable to detect.

What type of tests should I consider getting to fully calm my fears?  Thanks in advance, and thankbyou for your time.

Health,Should /r/health have a shoot-on-sight policy for domains that consistently provide false and/or misleading information?,"It's rare that I find myself advocating ad hominem attacks, but here we are.

While it's not as bad as it used to be, there's still a fair amount of woo that gets pitched in this reddit.  Some of it even makes it to the top page.  I try to refute these posts when I have time and inclination ([Today's example.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/psaho/doctors_now_firing_patients_who_reject_vaccination/c3rv8mw)).  

There are some sources that consistently provide bad information; i.e., whatever they want to believe is a ""fact"", without evidence or in spite of evidence to the contrary; i.e., woo.  

I would propose that articles from these sources be deleted out of hand, on the grounds that they've consistently shown zero regard for accuracy and evidence.  It shouldn't be necessary to waste time posting refutations for known woo-sellers to encourage other people to downvote and explain why it's getting reported.

Do you agree, and if so, who should be on the ban list?

medicine,Standards for /r/medicine?,"We get a fair amount of posts of dubious accuracy, and as a result I've been thinking for a while if we should have some explicit standards for /r/medicine posts. What do people think about the following two potential posting rules?

* Posts about medical news should be from a medical journal or at the very least a reliable news source that uses citations, with unreferenced articles and media sources with poor accuracy records (such as Psychology Today, the Daily Mail, and so on) being subject to removal.

* No memes. If you have something personal you'd like to share, share it in a more intelligent fashion and we'd love to hear it.

I think this would be excellent, in that it would first and foremost encourage people to post actually valuable information, rather than the lowest common denominator journalism that we often get instead of actual research. Second, it would empower us (the mods) to remove some of the garbage that comes in rather than let it sit around and set a de facto lower standard of posting, which encourages more of the same.

This wouldn't apply to blog posts about personal experiences or the sort of humor that we've had (such as the [homeopathy emergency room](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/pir6n/bbc_skit_about_homeopathy_replacing_medicine/) or [brain surgeon](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/pjz6w/in_keeping_with_the_last_that_mitchell_and_webb/) submissions): I think those are in keeping with what /r/medicine is. I would like to see the reliability and accuracy of submissions go up, however, and avoid poorly written posts about what could be good information if someone had bothered to find the actual medical data (such as with the recent [hepatitis C](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/psmql/university_of_alberta_researcher_discovers/) article, which could have been a great submission if from a better source, as the Medical XPress article didn't represent the data accurately).

Health,Tested Positive for MRSA; Looking for advice,"I'm not sure but I think I got it from my wife but maybe she got it from our son.  Wife had boil that was untested by the clinic she went to but it cleared up with some antibiotics.  Less than two weeks later I get one that my doctor tests as positive for MRSA.  I am now taking Cipro and seem to be healing okay.  My worry is for my son.  He's 1.5 years old and I've seen some pimples around his backside previously though non have produced puss.


I'm about to bleach anything I can in my freak out mode.  Should I get my wife and son tested to see if they are carrying it?

I have never had a ""weak"" immune system before but I happen to have a cold right now and I don't sleep well so I don't know if this thing just got lucky and latched on while my defenses were down or something else.

Health,"Just finished 2.5 years of chemo, any advice on how to get back to normal? (xpost from /r/cancer)","I just successfully finished treatments for leukemia in December; It was a pretty rough experience for my partner and I. Being a young female (22 at diagnosis.) having to stop my life completely to fight for my life was just heart breaking. 
While I am ecstatic to be able to begin my life again, I'm having such a hard time with my self appearance. At the start of my treatment I dropped over 30Lbs from my ideal weight, putting me at under 100Lbs. That, coupled with losing all my hair for over a year, killed my self confidence so terribly. Now, after bouncing back, I'm 30Lbs over my ideal weight. I struggle with the fact that these are superficial concerns, but it really feels like chemo has thrown my metabolism (not to mention everything else!) out of whack.

Health,What are the white spots under fingernails?,"I've Googled, but I seem to be getting multiple answers from multiple sources so I figured I'd see what Reddit has to say. 

I have white spots under almost all my fingernails, with the exception of my pinkies and ring fingers. First, I read it could be from minor trauma to the nails, as long as 6 weeks ago. I don't think I've managed to do that, especially to six fingers. Lots of people have said calcium and/or zinc deficiency, but I'm also reading that it is just a myth. There's also kidney or liver disease, but that seems to be when half or more of the nail is white, or after other symptoms. Finally, I read something about air bubbles under the nail. 

So, wtf is it, really? Anyone else experience these small white spots under more than just one nail at a time?",10,17,2012-02-19,PHARMA,0.05090853199362755,0.9161862730979919,0.03290523588657379

medicine,A question about junctional rhythm,"MSIII here - I couldn't find an answer to this with a quick internet search... hopefully meddit can help me out.  I may just be thinking about this the wrong way so please correct me if I'm wrong. 

In a patient with junctional rhythm you have an ectopic focus in the AV node which captures the heart.  Depolarization occurs anterograde down the bundle of His into the ventricles causing ventricular contraction.  In addition, if the ectopic focus is outpacing the SA node, depolarization will also occur in a retrograde fashion up into the atria (possibly causing inverted P waves in the EKG) subsequently leading to contraction of the atria.  This is where I get confused - if you have this anterograde and retrograde depolarization causing contraction of the atria and ventricles, what does the heart sound like on auscultation?  Is there some kind of simultaneous beat?  Am I correct in assuming that the retrograde depolarization causes contraction of the atria?  I'm confused as to how you could have any signification cardiac output with this kind of abnormality. 

Whenever I look up information on junctional rhythm there is only information about EKG changes.  I'm just trying to imagine in my head how the heart would move in this circumstance.  What would the heart sound like?

Any input is appreciated. Thanks!

medicine,Question about Transvaginal Ultrasound in USA (and the Virginia law),"So I'm a little stumped by the debate I've been loosely following regarding the mandated use of Ultrasound prior to abortion that was passed into law in Virginia. Since these will all be first trimester ultrasounds, the assumption being that they will all be TVUS.

At the central obstetrics hospital in melbourne, Australia, a TVUS is a standard part of the work up pre-termination of pregnancy. It's used to exclude ectopics and other pathological differentials before proceeding. I'm sure that a termination would be performed if the patient refused, but it's always explained as a neccessary part of the workup.

The stigma around TVUS and how it 'violates' the patient is truly bizarre (at lease to me). It's a medical procedure, it is done with the best interests of the mother (not the fetus or the mother's conscience or the doctor's conscience) and it should be largely painless (although it can be uncomfortable). 

Not only is TVUS used in pre-abortion diagnostics, but it's also used in the a large number of dating ultrasounds for expectant mothers, will be done for a huge number of people with antepartum bleeding (which is somewhere in the range of 25% of pregnant women). 

And also let's not forget that TVUS is probably far less daunting (and far less in the ""rape"" category) than speculum and PAP smears which are recommended for ALL (sexually-active) women every 2 years. And then of course there are bimanual examinations, which any pregnant woman will get over and over again as they get closer to delivery. 

So my question is, why is the idea of TVUS so offensive to such a large population of the public? I totally understand the undercurrents of the abortion debate as a driving force to this legislation, and making it legally mandated is definitely distinct from just ""strongly advised by medical practitioner"" or ""regular hospital policy"". But the stigma attached to TVUS and the absurd analogies to violation and rape seem entirely conterproductive. Surely with this sort of mainstream sentiment, it becomes more difficult to get women to go to essential diagnostic testing, let alone routine screening problems?

Or am I missing something else here? Is TVUS just not performed as regularly in the states? Is this the sort of thing that is regularly refused by patients?


And just as a bit of background, Victoria, Australia has entirely legalised abortions. Access is quite good and easy to find in the metropolitan centres (rural areas generally require a visit to Melbourne, the big city). Most abortions are performed in private clincs and hospitals, although they are also available free of charge through the public health system (although there is a limited availablility, and thus these are only for those without means).

Health,I can't smile. Like... physically can't smile.,"Hi guys. First time using /r/health, so I don't know if I'm allowed to ask for advice or what. Anyway, it seems that whenever I smile in a social setting, the corners of my mouth begin to twitch uncontrollably. The only remedy is immediately putting on a neutral look. Imagine how awkward it is to be laughing one minute and looking terrified the next!

I can replicate this tic on my own, but I seem to be able to control it. In social situations where I actually do happen to be smiling, however, I have absolutely no control over when it happens. It's been going on for maybe three months now, and I'm 16 years old currently.

Health,"Waiting for blood work results to come back...Can anyone possibly give me ""suggestions"" on what I might have?","So for the past 2 weeks or so, I've had quite a lot happen to me physically and emotionally.  Starting as just a panic attack, I'd get lightheaded, with sweaty palms and minor heart palpitations.  As the days passed, my symptoms would come and go unrelated to panic.

It's kind of hard to explain how I've been feeling, but it's been crappy.  I'll get random numbness (Almost like a mild burning) and sweating in my right hands and toes, even though they'll be cold.

I'll also feel like I have heartburn or indigestion, and sometimes trouble breathing (Very mild though, and just a minor discomfort).  I get sort of like a vertigo feeling, as if I'm falling (Like in a dream), along with mild nausea (No vomiting at all though).  Only today though, I've had some neck stiffness, but I think that's just because I slept on it wrong last night (It's been on and off today).

As the title said though, I went to the doctor's, got blood pressure/sugar checked, and both were fine, but they wanted to get blood work done (Blood sugar, thyroid, etc.) because they couldn't determine anything from my visit...

I just want some reassurance, or a possible answer as to what might be wrong, so I can stop worrying and get on with my life.  Some other info:  I'm overweight, typically inactive, no other health problems though.  As for what I think, I think it might either be panic disorder, hypoglycemia, or gastric reflux.  I had mild gastric reflux a few years back, and still have medication that I had prescribed which I tried taking, and it helped a bit with my nausea, so IDK.",24,11,2012-02-26,PHARMA,0.217850461602211,0.7595235705375671,0.022625992074608803
