pharmacy,Chains will only change with media exposure,"Title. CVS and Walgreens will only change their shitty practices with exposure to the media on how this is affecting patients. 

To that end, I have contacted a reporter, who seems to be interested in this story. I'm gathering information to send to them showing how CVS specifically (as that's who I work for) is lowering technician hours but raising or maintaining script budgets.

In Radar (or SPARK or whatever the fuck they're calling it now), if you go to Reports &gt; Green Sheets, you can select from multiple reports. Pharmacy Technician Hours, Pharmacy Total Hours, and Pharmacy prescription budgets are the ones I'm most interested in.

If you'd like to stir up some shit, PM me your Green Sheets (cover the top portion that shows your AREA/REGION/DISTRICT/STORE NUMBER as I don't need that). The more reports I get showing a consistent decrease in staffing the better.

If y'all have any other reports you think would be particularly damning, feel free to let me know. 

you can also email me at pmmeurgreensheets@protonmail.com
If you email me I highly recommend you make a protonmail account so our emails are encrypted, or use PGP encryption. I will freely give out my public key.

pharmacy,"[Rant] Does it seem like out of everyone in the medical profession, pharmacists are the only ones that care about the rules?","I realize prescribers and nurses have a lot of skill and knowledge, and this isn't a knock on them.

But man, sometimes it feels like I'm the person who is perceived as the medical bogeyman who has to put their foot down. I'm enforcing opioid and narcotic rules not to annoy people but because I got insurance companies, my wholesaler, the DEA and the board of pharmacy breathing down my neck. I'm clarifying stupid things on prescriptions because insurance can audit me and take back every cent they already paid me backdating to what seems like the dawn of time.

These narcotic limits are really starting to get to me. When you got a group of doctors who have been overprescribing narcotics their entire careers and suddenly it's up to the pharmacy to change their behavior (wtf?!), everybody is unhappy and I'm stuck in the middle just trying to do my job with maximum effort literally only making a few bucks per prescription.

Does anybody else in health care actually have consequences on a daily basis for their actions? Do medical insurance companies ever audit prescribers regularly with the possibility of taking back thousands of dollars for tiny errors? Do regulatory agencies ever regularly examine their controlled substance prescribing habits with a fine comb and tell them to change things? DOES ANYBODY CARE ABOUT PRESCRIBING GUIDELINES?!

Most of all, I'm frustrated that I'm the gatekeeper being told to tell knowledgeable and experienced professionals how to prescribe without having any real capacity to change anything myself. I feel like if their prescriptions are getting flagged, they can start dispensing in-house and take the entire risk upon their own license and leave the pharmacy out of it.

pharmacy,"As a customer, how can I let Walgreens know that I’m tired of their pharmacies being so understaffed?","I’m not a pharmacist or a tech, but I am a customer who is SICK of my local Walgreens being understaffed. It takes forever to drop off or pick up a prescription, everyone working in the pharmacy has a shitty attitude (probably *because* they’re chronically understaffed!), and I absolutely dread having to go there. Today I had to drop off a prescription and after waiting 10 minutes with no one else in front of me or in the store, the pharmacist finally sighed heavily and asked me what I needed in a way that made it so very obvious that my existence was a major inconvenience to her haha.

Yeah, she was rude for no reason, but the bigger problem is that EVERYONE (besides one always cheerful tech) is always so stressed and rude at this pharmacy. That’s not normal - I’m not a shitty customer. I don’t complain, I don’t ask stupid questions, I don’t ask anyone to call my insurance company for me because I understand that’s my job, I don’t say dumb things like, “But my doctor said he called it in, it MUST be here!”, and I just generally try to be as easy as possible. For everyone in this pharmacy to regularly look like they want to jump off the nearest bridge means this corporation fucking SUCKS to work for. 

I’ve never once made a complaint, but tonight when I picked up my prescription I very nicely mentioned to the pharmacy manager that they always seem really understaffed and overwhelmed, and that I didn’t want to make a formal complaint or anything but rather would like her to communicate to her bosses and corporate that the staffing issue is causing customers to be unhappy. She was very nice but basically just said, “We’ll try to do better and improve our attitudes!” That’s a nice sentiment but not even what I was going for - my point is not that they have bad attitudes but that their attitudes are clearly a symptom of an underlying disease/problem. I’m sure she already knows that and it’s out of her hands and she just said whatever she had to say to get me on my way, and that’s okay. I want to know though how I actually make it clear to corporate Walgreens that this is an issue - do I contact a district manager and then transfer my prescriptions out so they know why? Or will that get this pharmacy “in trouble”? Do I just transfer my prescriptions without contacting anyone at Walgreens at all and, if so, where to? We don’t have a good independent pharmacy nearby but we do have grocery stores - Wegmans, Harris Teeter, Target. Do those places treat their pharmacists and techs better? I assume CVS is the same sort of dumpster fire that Walgreens is.

In short, I’m sorry for anyone who works at an understaffed Walgreens, and I’m wondering how I can actually let Walgreens know that it’s not okay.",134,362,2019-03-09,PHARMA,0.1978486031293869,0.7777450680732727,0.02440633624792099
medicine,"As a pharmacist, I really want to thank all of you physicians out there for giving us your time when we ask for it. I just want to give you a little of my perspective on our end.","In retail pharmacy, we toe a very dangerous line every day. We often get a prescription that doesn't fit the standard or maybe doesn't fit our assessment of the patient. When this happens, we have to assume one of two things:

* A) There is something I don't know that makes this situation unique.
* B) The physician made a mistake.

Around 99% of the time, it's option A, and we know this. But it's dangerous, because if it was *actually* option B, things could go wrong and I could find myself in a courtroom within the year. Working in pharmacy demands that we have confidence in the prescribers around us, otherwise the healthcare engine would grind to a halt.

**So believe me, when we pharmacists get you on the phone, we're not saying you're incompetent, or even suggesting that you made a mistake. We already know that you took into consideration our concerns, because they were your concerns too. We know that you already weighed the risks and benefits and made the call, and it's probably documented in the chart. We trust you, but we want to verify.**

I was handed a Rx recently that was a new start for both Metoprolol 50mg BID and Lasix. The patient had recently experienced some symptoms of decompensation (no cardiac pmhx though), which made them decide to go to the hospital, where they were admitted for an overnight stay. In my head, I'm thinking that as far as I'm aware, if there's any indication of HF, beta blockers need to be initiated on a Start Low, Go Slow protocol. Obviously, with the wrong person, initiating at 50mg BID could get real bad, real quick.

It's always a tough call on whether to pick up the phone in the moment, but for stupid reasons. If I decide to contact the physician to verify, I'll probably get an annoyed patient, I'll have to call and get redirected through 5 different lines, hear a ""just fill it"" from the doc, who I know is already busy, and then get an ""I told you so"" from a doubly annoyed patient. 

In this case, it happened to be a weekend and I had to be redirected to the *personal phone* of the cardiologist, who was off work. But I had a very nice cordial chat with the physician, despite being out with the kids in the background. They had done some kind of tolerance test that I am still not aware of, and apparently the metoprolol would play some rate control function as well and they wanted it under control quite quickly (patient never mentioned any kind of arrhythmia). I still don't completely understand the situation or the decision, but that doesn't matter, I just needed to know that it was carefully thought out and it wasn't a mistake. Patient was super understanding too.

Anyway, that's the only time I've ever spoken to a cardiologist on the phone, and probably the nicest conversation I've had with a doctor outside of the GP who works next door. So thank you docs for not minding us asking you to basically repeat your chart notes to us.

medicine,Is this a HIPAA violation?,"Let's say I'm the admitting hospitalist. I stop admitting patients at 7pm. Well, it's 5pm and I'm done with my admissions, and I'd like to know the possibility of me getting another admission(s) before 7pm.

So I check the ED list and see there's 15 patients roomed. All I can see are names, ages, chief complaint (sometimes there, sometimes not), and arrival time. I see there is an 82 year old with chest pain, that arrived about an hour ago.

As everyone knows, ""chest pain"" in an ED setting can lead down MANY paths. If the patient's cardiac enzymes, pain characteristics, response to treatment, or ECG are concerning, I know they're probably coming in. If not, they may be going home. And if they are coming in, and it's getting towards the end of my shift, I'd like to be a bit prepared so I can finish the admission promptly before my relief arrives for their busy night.

So, would it be a HIPAA violation if I were to open the chart, look at the test results, and read the ED note to prepare myself for the possible admission?

What if the chief complaint isn't even listed, or does that make a difference?

Thank you!

pharmacy,CVS Specialty is the worst company I have ever interacted with. Not confident they are actually a working “pharmacy” at this point.,"Kinda long rant but here we go. I have to use CVS Spec because I have CVS Caremark. The delivery of the this med (Botox) is incredibly timely because I will have to pay a cancellation fee and wait like 3+ months if I don’t get it done this appt (March 12 btw). I told CVS my appt was on the 6th so I could be confident it would be on time, and this is what my doctors office recommend. 

By the first week of Feb, my prior auth was approved and on file at CVS. My doc sent over a script around the 15th of feb. They didn’t get the script so my doctor sent it again within a day or two. Then, I call to make sure they got it and they did (Feb 22). For some reason, the script has to go through some process prior to being filled and paid for so they don’t allow me to do that at that time (Feb 22 at this point). Keep in mind that they have the script and have the prior auth. They also have me on the phone ready to pay with my credit card in hand. But nope. I have to wait for it to be processed and someone will get back to me at a point unknown. 

After some tense ass conversation and special overrides, they allow me to enter the “process” (Feb 25). After giving them all my medical history and billing info, they agree to deliver the drug by March 6. On March 4th I call my doctor to make sure they had received the drug or were scheduled to do so. They say nope, CVS hasn’t called us at all. I immediately call CVS pretty mad. I say what the fuck is going on, why haven’t you scheduled the delivery??? They say the script was on a pile and would be processed by someone. I said no, it should have been processed by whomever days ago so obviously that person is sleeping on the job or something. They apologize profusely and say they will have it delivered by the 6th and not to worry.

On March 8th I call CVS to see if they have delivered the drug. NOOOOOOOOOPPPPPEEEE. We are two days past what they thought was my appointment . This drug is over $1000. So it’s not like I picked it up somewhere else prior to my appointment or something. I was livid. They didn’t even call me to say “hey sorry we won’t be getting the drug to your doctors office for the appointment you scheduled months in advance and takes over 30 minutes of the doctors time.” The women is very sorry. She says she will call the doctors office right away and schedule a delivery for the soonest possible date.

Like most doctors, mine is not open on Saturdays. CVS could ship the drug Friday at this point (the 8th) for a Saturday delivery but unfortunately, no one will be in the office to get the drug and refrigerate it. I ask for a Monday delivery (the 11th). Nope, not possible because the spec pharmacy doesn’t ship anything on Sundays. 

So here we are... CVS has agreed to ship the drug Monday and they say it will be delivered by midday Tuesday. My appt is Tuesday at 4pm. I asked the women at CVS if they would reimburse me any fees if the appointment was canceled due to their incredibly horrible business practices and she said no, that wasn’t really their policy. 

I am 100% confident it would have taken them months (if ever) to read the script, call me for payment, and then schedule the delivery if I hadn’t called them every god damn step of the way (more than once in most cases). What pisses me off the most is that they knew they missed the Feb 6th deadline I gave them and didn’t even call me or the doctor. They waited until I discovered that one on my own. 

Will the drug be at the office by 4pm this Tuesday? It’s in God’s hands now.

pharmacy,Reconstitution tips for techs at retail or outpatient pharmacies.,"I'm a pharmacy tech. I was reading through a post earlier and noticed some people were having trouble with reconstituting; leaks, clumps, powder that won't get off the bottom.  This is my method of reconstituting.  

Turn the bottle to the side and tap the power loose.  Do not flip it upside down to loosen it. You'll end up mixing air into the powder and the powder will fly out a little like a tiny dust storm. 

Remove the seal carefully and completely (practice will make this easier and faster).  Start by cutting down the middle.  Pull up the seal at the end near the edge of opening and peel around the edge. Remember to keep pulling from the base of the seal and not the tip of the seal you've loosened up. This will prevent it from tearing. Follow this method to remove the remaining half of the seal.

Onto reconstituting.  Triple check the amount of water you need to reconstitute.  I've seen plenty of techs mess this up.  I've done it myself because my training was from CVS before they had actual training courses. I've seen veteran techs mess this up too.

If you have a FillMaster skip the next paragraph or don't.  FillMaster can fail, especially if not maintained weekly. 

Once you've checked how much water you need, pour half of it into the bottle.  A lot of techs think it's easier to pour all of the water in at once.  Don't.  You run into problems like clumping and the power sticking to the bottom of the bottle.  A poorly mixed bottle will under dose the patient. 

Replace the cap tightly and **FLIP** the bottle upside down.  Roll it in your hands and tap the top and sides to loosen the powder. It should fall into the water.  There shouldn't be any pieces left on the bottom of the bottle.  Gently shake it to make sure that the water covers the inner surface of the bottle.  Then shake vigorously.  Flip it right side up and let it sit on the counter for 5 seconds.  Failing to do this is how you get leaks.  The mixture at the bottom of the cap will flow into the grooves thus causing the leaks. Unscrew the cap and keep the opening facing the ground and check the cap.  It should be nearly clean or have a drop.

Now add the rest of the water.  Recap and shake well.  If you need to add adapters (for oral syringes), let it sit, uncap, wipe the inside of the cap and the edges of the bottle opening.  Then add the adapter. 

This is my method.  I've been able to get it done pretty quickly now.  Maybe a minute tops for two bottles.  No leaks, clumps or bottle stickies at the bottom.",63,97,2019-03-13,PHARMA,0.12392836064100266,0.849732518196106,0.026339078322052956

Person calls me and introduces herself as a student of homeopathy and wondering if I can order lindane lotion for her (it’s been off the market for a long time).

She has tried all the “homeopathic” remedies and none worked (I wonder why?)

Apparently she has scabies which are resistant to permethrin 5%.  She is looking for a homeopathic remedy and needs the lindane because that is what she found in her research.

She insists it’s still made because her book says so.  I asked her what book it is and she responded “it’s my book I look up all the latest information in, MY PDR”.  (For those that don’t know the PDR is the “Physician’s Desk Reference” which you get updates sent all the time and you’re supposed to take pages out and add others, it’s a complete garbage reference).

I asked when the last time it was updated?  She responds that she is not about to pay them a bunch of money for new stuff because of big pharma yada yada.  I then asked when it was written....1982!

pharmacy,"Passed 2019 Naplex/Mpje, takeaways","I am not really a blogger, but I know that when I was taking the Naplex and MPJE I was reading a bunch of ""passed"" vs ""failed"" posts and felt they helped me through the process of taking these exams. So I thought I would do the same.


I'm a 2018 grad from a pretty highly ranked school of pharmacy, graduated with a 3.6. But GPA's don't really represent you well. I would say for me, I essentially was great at learning the information, and essentially forgot it right after midterms/finals, unless I was really interested in the topic. I couldn't take the exams earlier for a whole bunch of personal reasons, so I had to wait until now. I studied in the early hours of the morning M-F while working a 9-5, and Saturdays and Sundays.


-MPJE EXPERIENCE-


I took my MPJE in February and passed on the first try. The tools I used to study include: Strauss 2018 law book, 2018 Federal law book by RxPrep, Online practice questions by RxPrep, BOP NJAC Chapter 39 and other relevant rules/statutes online, and pharmacyexam.com. Took about 1 month.


I originally was just studying a chapter a day of Strauss' book, and then I decided to add on by getting the Federal law book by RxPrep because I guess I didn't like Strauss' book very much. The RxPrep book and online questions helped a LOT. About a week before the exam I took the pharmacyexam.com practice test and did not do well. I checked my answers and found that some information in Strauss' book was just flat out wrong. I don't know if this happened because I had the 2018 version of the book, or if the book just sucks (had no reference because I'm from out of state). But I do know that some of the information was just outdated and should not have been incorporated in the book at all considering I bought it in March 2018 (example- NJ as of the 2017 biennial period requires 1 CE in opioid education, and this information was no where in the Strauss book). I actually ended up spending the last week before the exam going through the entire book, looking at relevant statutes, and correcting misinformation. I wouldn't say most of it was wrong, but there were WAY too many mistakes for it to be reliable when used alone. 


I don't know that it mattered much because the exam was definitely not what I expected. I walked away thinking maybe 20% of what I studied was actually on there, tops. I did a lot of guessing. And the worst part is the exam is supposed to adjust in difficulty depending on how you answer the questions, and I felt like I got a bunch of easy questions that I just didn't know the answer to because it wasn't in my study material. I say this because a lot of the posts I read said the questions were vague and difficult to understand or just very long and hard- this was not the case for me, and I passed anyway. Left the exam room with 1.5 hours left on the clock. 


Takeaway from MPJE experience: expect the unexpected. There is no way to know what will be on there, so learn everything you possibly can. Use reliable sources. I would NOT recommend Strauss to anyone, but if you buy and/or use it, I wish you well. Had I not taken a practice tests, I most likely would have failed because I wouldn't have known the right from wrong/missing.


-NAPLEX EXPERIENCE-


Materials used: 2018 RxPrep book, 2019 RxPrep online practice questions, PreNaplex (1). I studied for about 2 months. 


I did about a chapter a day initially. I didn't always get through entire chapters before work. I always made sure to do RxPrep practice problems in my spare time, though. For reference, I was getting anywhere between 60-90% on those questions (I made sure to do some questions in all of the topics), with most of my scores in the 60' and 70's. When the whole MPJE fiasco happened I didn't study the week before the MPJE at all, and then after the MPJE I had to do 2 chapters a day for about 3 weeks before my Naplex to finish all of the chapters. Had about 4 days (took 2 PTO days) before my Naplex to review. The first two days, I essentially studied 10 hours a day, going over chapters again and doing RxPrep practice problems. The third day I took the Prenaplex and got a 98, which got me feeling too comfortable, admittedly- I couldn't get myself to study more lol. The Prenaplex I took was WAY easier than RxPrep. HOWEVER, I thought the Naplex was WAY harder than the Prenaplex (but not harder than RxPrep). I was shocked. One thing I regret about the Naplex is not checking my math or any of the problems like I would during a midterm in school- for the NAPLEX once the problem was answered I moved on. I finished it in 3.5 hours, which means I would have had plenty of time to double check myself. But I passed the Naplex with triple digits.


 Generally speaking, I didn't focus on any one chapter while studying- I may have spent more time doing ID, HIV, Onc, and DM, but only because they seemed more bulky than other chapters. I knew them all essentially equally well, except for maybe 3 chapters I admittedly slacked on (skin, anticoag, seizures). For the last 2 weeks, I did calc (including biostats and PK) every day for about a half hour, but before that I did it on and off throughout the 2 months. The topics were varied pretty fairly, except my exam was at least 20% Anticoag. And there were DEFINITELY skin and seizure questions in there..


Takeaway from Naplex experience: RxPrep is great, use it. Definitely do the practice problems by RxPrep, they are way harder than the Prenaplex and naplex. Don't bother with focusing on specific topics, but don't slack on any!!!! The exam can and will have ANYTHING, though probably not everything.

medicine,Doctors working in public hospitals in Germany are voting about whether to go on strike.,"Source: https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/klinikaerzte-103.html (German)

Rough translated, shortened content: 
&gt;55.000 doctors working in over 500 publically owned hospitals, &gt;represented by their union ""Marburger Bund"", refused an offer &gt;made by the employers negotiators in the ongoing negotiations &gt;about working contracts and conditions (""Tarifverhandlungen"").

&gt;Employers offered a 5,4 % raise in 2 steps over 2.5 years.
&gt;Marburger Bund demanded a 5% raise and new negotiations new &gt;conditions after 1 year, additionally they demanded exact &gt;registration of working time and a time limit on call-, overnight &gt;-and weekend-hours.

&gt;The Marburger Bund called the offer proposed by the employers &gt;""not acceptable"", and ""an attempt to take our self-estem"".

&gt;To force issues, doctors will begin voting whether to go on strike &gt;soon. An emergency service will always be availiable.

&gt;Strikes, while common in other sectors, are rare for doctors.
&gt;It would be the second doctors strike, the first being in 2006.

Almost all doctors up to young attendings in Germany are employed through union-negotiated contracts. 
The doctors union boasts 118.00 members and is Europe´s biggest, recruiting members already in University through cheap or free insurance for its members, workshops and help in law or empoyment issues.

I'm quite thankful for representation and someone who is willing to deal with empoyers, as i dont feel confident negotiating pay andworking condition as a mere resident. 
Also transparency regarding pay of my peers feels nice and hopefully prevents any discrimination.

You can view the current pay grades [in this table](
https://www.marburger-bund.de/sites/default/files/tarifvertraege/2018-08/entgelttabelle-zum-tv-aerztevka.pdf)

The groups represent
I : resident physicians

II: physicians who finished residency and are ""Fachärzte"", specialty doctors

III: ""Oberärzte"", attending physicians

IV: ""leitende Oberärzte"", chief attendings, second to the chief.


The ""Entwicklungsstufen"" are raises after a certain amount of time you practiced in the pay group (I-IV)



How are employment conflics handled in your country?

Is there a big difference in pay?


**EDIT:**
As many comments pointed out, the tables provided only show base compensation (42h work week, paid vacation) **before** taxes, but without the compensation for taking call, which can boost your monthly income significantly 

Also, the tables are only for hospital-employed doctors. independent physicians are earning a lot more, depending on specialty, location and patient census.

medicine,"Ladies (and Men) of Medicine, how do you deal with patients’ comments about your appearance?","I’m currently a PA student on clinicals and I’m gettin real tired of the comments. Usually it’s the middle-age/old men. Never overtly sexual (except the “subtle” boob glances) but, as an example my patient yesterday told my male preceptor he was “lucky to have such a beautiful woman as a student”. I also get a lot of comments about how young I look from all sorts of patients - leading to lots of “girly” and “little girl” comments. I’ve even been thinking of cutting my hair to look a little older. At first I didn’t really care - I’ve been a bartender and a waitress so it’s nothing I haven’t heard before. But lately it’s every damn day and this morning I even had the thought, “Am I actually good at talking to patients or do they just smile and nod cause I’m pretty?” I’m usually really confident in my clinical skills and so it suddenly hit home how those comments can sink in over time.

How do you deal with this from patients specifically? I know guys go through this too. And I mean any inappropriate comments about your appearance, not just being called attractive. My boyfriend thinks that, since I’m a student, it’s my preceptor’s responsibility to pull the patient aside at the end of the visit and give them a “talking to”. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the advise and encouragement peeps! I cannot grow a beard as many of you have done. I liked the idea of having some go-to lines in my pocket so I thought of some. A lot of the advice applied to hospitals, which is great because that's where I'd like to end up. But I'm a lot more willing to put up with a patient I'll only see for a week or so. My issue is with the idea of allowing your established patients at the clinic to make comments - especially when you're the primary care provider.

medicine,More of the same,"Woke up tired. Another night that felt like I didnt sleep. Tried to breathe but my nose was clogged. Must be sick. Not bad enough to stay home. Plus, half the patients on the team are sick with probably the same thing. Cant give it back.

Morning report was fine. Had a good teaching point and the residents liked it. Maybe today will finally be a good day on service this week. None so far.

EMR was slow last night. Reset it, hoped it would help. Even slower this morning. Senior resident called about an admission, need to see the splitter with the resident before rounds, dont want to sabotage the progress we made. If the computer stays slow, I dont think I'll finish my pre-rounds. Need a third coffee. 

Rounds dont start well. All of the likely discharges say they dont want to go home today. One is angry, his spouse even moreso. I talked with all of them at length last night. Not surprised. 

Time to work on the discharges. Headed to the angry ones. Can barely start. We lied. I said 1.5l restriction instead of 2. Almost everyone has a restriction this week. I dont know how to practice because I didnt call the liver doctor. He has a new diagnosis of cirrhosis. No lab abnormalities, has consult as an outpatient. I start to explain the reasons for inpatient consults but I'm just talking over her. And I dont tell them enough of what is happening. They say the resident lied. He mentioned an old hemoglobin, not this AM. She calls him smug. I tell her it's not ok to talk like that to my resident. It has its desired effect. She doesnt pay attention to him anymore. Now it's just me. Patient relations comes in, now she wont talk to us anymore. Probably best. 

Specialists are calling. GI cant change the NJ until tomorrow. It's the patients third admission this week because everyone keeps messing up his tubes or his feeds. Hes exasperated, and now I am too. Fine, we will swap it for his stomach and get a friend in IR to advance it. PT changed their note on the angry patient. Meets inpatient rehab now, doesnt have to go home. Looks even more like we lied. The renal transplant is refusing to leave. His diarrhea is almost resolved. Neph is concerned. But his kidneys are fine. Call ID. They are concerned. But his viral studies are negative and he didnt stool for the studies. Call GI. They never do scopes inpatient. Except now they will later this week. Guess we keep him. Hes now stable for the third day. 

Should see the hospice patients. First one is lying alone. Need to talk to family. Dehydrating. No IV, refuse lines. Refuse treatment. Refuse hospice. No labs, no treatment, no vitals for over 24 hours. Needs to go home to family, but they're hardly around. Still full code. 

Next one. HIV+, colorectal cancer. Dilaudid drip, finally working. Sister is there. Thought he would go home but family cant manage. Yesterday he didnt meet inpatient criteria. I dont think he will last more than two days now. Will keep him here. We discuss life, mortality, guilt, family, pain, health. She cries, then smiles. Easiest patient by far. Never used to be. 


Angry one refuses rehab now, wants to go home but needs a Walker. Lost his, insurance wont pay for another. We give him gift cards to get one. They threaten to sue. 

Went downstairs to sit for a minute. Its after two, haven't had a chance to get a drink or food since the third coffee. Saw our wellness rep. Had a long talk last week about the system. I have to change it, doctors are dropping like flies. I said I was going to start with the policy that is keeping my splitter stuck on the wards. They listened, they had a meeting and agree the policy needs to be changed. I asked for an early dispensation for her. They said no. It has to go through committees first. I told my colleague this. We both laugh weakly. We talk about him not working the wards anymore. This is just one more example why. I tell him I'll do more than change a policy. I'll burn them all down if that's what it takes. Someone needs to. 

They cant do the NJ. The patient is too anxious to do it. A little ativan should help. Nurse paged, new policy states that is procedural sedation, cant do it. Fine. Cancel NJ, give ativan. Set timer for 30 minutes to remind resident to go do it ourselves then. Have to burn that policy too. 

Start to sign notes. Have fridays PA notes from clinic. Have yesterdays inpatient notes since the computer was slow. Today's now too. Have to write my own now from all the family meetings and patient complaints. Go to messages. Up to 70. No show reminders from clinic. Inpatient glucose warnings. Behavioral contracts I need to review. Patient complaints about other doctors. Found one buried about a patient out of meds, needs them today. Glad I didnt miss it. 

Its 530 now. Still haven't finished the note from the angry patient. If I do it quick, I can be home soon. Will need to eat dinner quick to save enough time to have the birthday party for my daughter. Then off to Boy Scouts. After, maybe a beer. Maybe bed. Maybe tomorrow wont be any worse.

medicine,Is there a doctor on this flight? My story.,"I am a young doctor, recently graduated. I fly frequently and last week I faced a very scary situation that I would like to share here. My actions helped save a life, I think.

The plane had started moving on runaway and we were just about to take off, when a kid started screaming 3 rows behind me. I assumed he was cranky about flying until suddenly I noticed the flight crew rushing past. She grabbed the child and started shouting, ""Is there a doctor on this flight?"" I stood up reflexively without even thinking ( part of me screaming this was a very bad idea) and she immediately dumped the kid in my lap. 

He was about 1 year old. I don't have much experience with such an young age. Actively seizing. Grand mal. Frothing secretions from his mouth. Chest not rising. My mind went perfectly blank for a couple of seconds. This was bad, very bad. In the background I could hear the mother screaming her head off about her baby dying.

Training kicked in fast. A crowd was rapidly building up, someone slapping him, someone else trying to open his mouth. I shouted at everyone to back off and told the air hostess to bring the medical kit and oxygen asap. We created a empty space for him and I put him in recovery position, removing any big objects in vicinity.

Now the problem arose. The air crew had no medical training and did not know the contents of their kit. There was no drug to stop his fits, no anti epileptics, no benzos or any sedative. Nothing to establish i.v. access with or anything I could give nasally or rectally. I had no means to stop his seizure. I briefly asked mother about any recent history of fever, any prior history of fits, any medical problem. Everything was normal so far. This was his first fit apparently. He had eaten 2 hours prior.

By this time they had brought oxygen cylinder and a mask which was useless as he wasn't breathing anyways. I had to take control of his airway as his fits were continuous and I was worried about hypoxia, aspiration or a cardiac arrest. There was nothing to control airway either. There was a neonatal ETT but no pediatric size laryngoscopes. A small miracle happened and someone brought a AMBU and mask, all adult sizes. They actually had nothing pediatric with them.

I stuffed gauze around the mask and started ventilating with AMBU. They had no suction or monitors either, not even a pulse ox. He had started developing peripheral cyanosis although it could be me imagining things in panic. I was trembling head to toe. He thankfully had a good pulse so far. I asked for a big roll of gauze and in between breaths, tried to mope up as much of his secretions as I could. They found a steth in the meanwhile. 

He stopped seizing after 5 mins. He still wasn't breathing. Not responding to pain either. I continued ventilation, trying to avoid hyperventilation, checking pulse intermittently. On auscultation I could tell he had aspirated a bit. I kept on mopping excess secretions. His cyanosis disappeared. After 10-15 mins he started breathing. Chest was rising again. I put a mask on him, covered him with a blanket and kept on rubbing his back to stimulate him. He still hadn't opened his eyes and wasn't responding to painful stimuli either.

In the meanwhile, another issue had arrived. This was a flight on way to USA. The cabin crew wanted to take off. The pilot came to speak with me, emphasizing how important it was to start on time as delay would cause a massive financial loss. I told him not to continue, in my professional opinion. I couldn't release an unconscious kid to them as I was scared of another fit and cardiac arrest. The family involved agreed to let me decide the plan of action.

30 mins after it started, he opened his eyes and started crying. I can't tell how relieved I was to hear that cry. The on ground pediatrician came after 45 mins. They attached monitors and his saturation was 96%. The pediatricrian agreed that my decision to stop the flight was the correct one. They took him in an ambulance to a nearby hospital. I was afraid they would come after me for stopping the flight and I was very relieved when he agreed with my decision. The family couldn't thank me enough.

I struggle with imposter syndrome a lot. I make mistakes often and I don't know everything. But when I left that flight as we landed eventually, I knew I had helped save that kid so apparently I am not entirely useless.

Thank you for reading this super long story. I have hid some details for the sake of anonymity. 😊 

Edit:  Couple of things. I look young. I am a female. I forgot my registration ID when they asked me( got registered 2 months ago). This happened in a developing country. Lastly, they didn't realize the danger that kid was in, until I explained how rapidly he could desaturate. This all could be why they were reluctant to stop initially.

medicine,Billable Hours,"One of the culprits frequently blamed for burnout in medicine is the amount of work that's done that isn't paid, isn't really medical, and largely isn't recognized. The American model of healthcare is also already bloated and too expensive, so tacking on more costs is probably a non-starter, but after (of course) talking to a lawyer about billable hours, I started thinking about all the things that could at least conceivably change.

For example, for every patient visit, there is also time required for documentation. Sometimes that can be done during the visit, but that often leaves patients dissatisfied because we look at the screen instead of talking to them. Plus, it often can't be finished, leading to the infamous crush of notes to be finished at the end of the day, either at the office/hospital or taken home. What if, instead, time and cost for doing that were built in? Your appointment is X minutes, and you (or your insurance) pays for X+Y minutes, where Y is a reasonable amount of time to write a note? (In reality, I think physicians—and especially companies/organizations employing physicians—would use any extra time to cram in more patients, though.)

Or take calls for prior authorization. Put together all the time on hold, transfers, waiting for someone to make a decision, faxing, and calling back, and it can really add up. If physicians could just bill for that time it would create a perverse incentive to intentionally waste time on useless prior auths that we really had no intention of getting approved. But I do think that having insurance pay for time wasted on prior authorizations that do go through would create a useful incentive for insurance to be reasonably efficient and responsive. (Tracking time would be a little bit difficult, and I worry that it would ratchet up insurance's efforts to deny all meds so they could also deny all prior auth bills.)

Patient phone calls, FMLA/SS(D)I paperwork, coordinating with other doctors, all of these take time. Getting paid might be a fight, but it would also cut down on wastes of our time, which would allow us to care for more patients and maybe make the system work more smoothly.

The insurance pays for wasted time idea is the one I think is most conceivably workable. I'm interested in any thoughts others have, at least for the sake of imagining a better system.",79,241,2019-03-22,PHARMA,0.06581544131040573,0.9080629944801331,0.026121502742171288

Severely low tech budget hours, long shifts with no breaks, fatigue, &amp; distractions all while under the constant emotional threat and stress of termination.

The board of pharmacies is meant to protect the patients but have done little to change the working conditions of pharmacist and pharmacy technicians to prevent medication errors. Corporations’ drive to improve profits and metrics continuously push pharmacists to do more with less. Pharmacy employees are afraid to report anything to the board or make an organized effort in fear of retaliation from their employers.

medicine,Scrubs or Professional clothes ?,"I am an attending physician, hospitalist. In my hospital, almost all of the medical specialty docs wear professional clothes and most of the surgical specialty / ER docs wear scrubs. In addition to that, almost anyone else who works in my hospital, is in scrubs. However, all of my colleagues wear professional clothes - you know, pant-shirt, blouse-skirts etc. I do that too, but I like to wear scrubs. Now, my director (leader of the hospitalist program, aka, my boss) is a 40-ish female physician and feels STRONGLY against scrubs. She says that you are not a moonlighter or a resident and shouldn't wear scrubs, and in extreme cases, if you have to, please wear a white coat on top of it. Everytime she sees me wearing scrubs, she shows such genuine surprise and remarks about it. Kind of unnerving.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is what I think about scrubs :-

\- they are super comfortable

\- its a hassle to make sure clothes are clean, ironed and ready, every morning, especially with a 7 am - 7 pm schedule, not to mention the pain to mix and match styles and colors

\- they are super professional for the type of work I do , FFS, I am not wearing a bikini thong while seeing a patient

\- they are issued by the hospital, if it was so wrong, the hospital would just stop issuing scrubs to me

\- I dont see a point walking into an infection with my $100-200 worth of professional clothes

\- almost ALL other countries, anyone who works in a hospital, is MANDATED to wear scrubs (aka hospital supplied clothes), I dont understand the American obsession of dressing up like a car salesman

\- my job is 100% clinical ( well 20% clinical and 80% computer typing), I dont have ANY managerial or administrative duties and its 100 % inpatient. I am dressing for the job

\- I tried to look up my hospital official policies, but so far, no luck. I guess we are just expected to dress up professionally.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to know how to deal with the situation. I have expressed my desire to wear scrubs multiple times, but she just doesnt get it. In the back of my mind, I want to say that unless you tell me I will be fired or disciplined for wearing scrubs, I will continue to wear them, But honestly I would never want it to escalate it to this level.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what should i do ?

Should i talk to the director ?

Should I just give up and start dressing up like a car salesman ?

Is there a middle ground ?

&amp;#x200B;

medicine,Dealing with an unexpected death of a patient,"I am a PGY 2 doctor doing a 1 year training position in internal medicine. Finished my intern year 2 months ago.

I had the evening/night shift (3.30 pm to 9 am) sunday-monday. I had 83 patient in my care between 4 different wards. Only doctor in my department at work.

It was a busy night. I was dealing with an obstructive ileus in a patient initially commited with a uti and a few with respiratory problems that were fairly easily managed.

I was called to the patient in question around 11.30 pm (don't really want to go into the specific case details - went over those with two different senior doctors). I examined him, asked for a consult from the appropriate specialty, made a plan and thought nothing more of it. He seemed well enough when speaking to him and his vitals was nothing out of the ordinary for him. 

The nurses called me at 6 am telling me he was found dead in his bed. I had to show up and declare him dead.

I did not see this coming at all. I was totally shocked. I have had people die in my care before, but those times we had either stopped active care or it was not-so-surprising.

He was 77. He had several comorbidities. Still, I was in shock. I wasn't able to keep it together. I called my attending on call, my mother and a friend I knew was on shift at a different hospital, who luckily was having a quiet morning. I made it through the morning conference without crying, even while presenting this patient. But I couldn't hold back the tears afterwards. Talked to another senior colleague for 30 minutes after. Everyone was really nice.

I went to eat and have two beers with some intern colleagues yesterday. Talked it out again. Managed to have a nice evening. But I couldn't get myself to work today. I feel awful. I keep questioning myself - if I could have prevented it somehow - even though my seniors have assured me I did a good job. This was my first truly unexpected death, but surely it wont be my last. I knew it would happen some day, as all of us do.

I am going to go to work tomorrow. And I have an appointment with my psychologist on thursday, but any advice would be appreciated.

EDIT: I want to sincerely thank every single one of you - also the few of you I didn't get around to answer directly. I read and appreciated all of your comments.

medicine,What will keep the AMA's AMA on burn out from being a total farce?,"Based on my knowledge of physician wellness talking heads, I know how this thing on Friday will go. We will pose lots of hard questions, many of which I will list below, and they will dodge them. Instead they are going to talk about how their paper, and their yoga program, and their getting together and brainstorming great ideas will fix all the problems. Meanwhile they will fail to meaningfully address anything that detracts from their ""hooray for us""  message. How do I know this? Because this happens with almost every policy maker who shows up on Reddit. 

so what's going to happen? Is there going to be some sort of enforcement of a good-faith efforts to acknowledge the massive problems facing physician burnout remediation? Or will this be an advertisement with information that could be spewed out by a low-quality chatbot? And these are the things are going to fail to acknowledge:


Mandatory wellness sessions that are not protected mean we have to stay at work another hour or more to catch up on the things we were supposed to be doing. You make it worse.

Yoga and dogs are not going to reverse physician burnout. Being proud of yourselves for offering these things does not mean you're doing something meaningful. 

Physician burnout will be helped by addressing the main causes of burnout, which include disempowerment, too much paperwork, too much work, not enough administrative support, etc. 

PowerPoints about how we should build resilience and admonishments not to kill ourselves are demoralizing and insulting. Telling us we need to try to get sleep and exercise when you're deliberately working us 80 hours or more is just plain mean. 

Every single hospital administration led wellness program is created and enacted by people who work about 40 hours a week. Until the administrator shadows a doctor for an entire week straight, their opinion is not worth a tenth of the money spent on fancy banners and pamphlets.  

Dissuade us from the notion that physician suicides are just the cost of doing business. Every business makes a cost-benefit analysis, ie the cost of implementing a safety measure versus the cost of paying out for wrongful death often does not balance in the favor of preventing harm. Quite frankly, the cost of replacing and retraining a few dozen physicians year is a lot less than the system-wide changes required to reduce burnout. 

Edit: I was actually so tired when I read through that AMA post that I thought it was the AMA. I'd blame the system for that but that's just what happens when you can't sleep. :/",120,411,2019-03-27,PHARMA,0.0887749195098877,0.8869042992591858,0.024320755153894424

medicine,Religion in Medicine,"Today I was cornered by a patient about my religious beliefs. I’m not sure why she wanted to know so badly but in the moment I made the decision to be honest and tell her that I’m actually an atheist. She found this appalling and when the attending came in it was brought up, I was forced to pray with them (which apparently he does quite regularly) during which time she prayed for me to be saved. Afterward the attending’s advice was for me not to talk to patient’s about my beliefs, and that ideas like mine are really frowned upon. I got the notion that he resented my beliefs as well.

Earlier in my education, a different attending had given a lecture about how it is impossible to be a good physician without God. So far I’ve been asked to pray with patients on 3 separate occasions now (Bible Belt) and it’s not something I had thought about much before this year. 

I don’t know how to feel about this. It feels disingenuous to pretend to believe in anything for the sake of appeasing people, but at the same time I’m not looking to create trouble with my patients. 

Does anyone have any insight into this? We live in a time where being an atheist is still a rather unpopular thing to be, despite how forgiving reddit may be about it, and I’m trying to make forward progress with my thoughts and actions on this issue.

medicine,"It’s Doctor’s Week. How can physicians or medical students engage in and promote a culture of health, while reducing burnout? Two doctors and a wellness coordinator from Children’s National Health System says Ask Me Anything – AMA!","Whether you’re studying for the MCAT or a practicing physician, you know that giving your best to patients every day can often mean putting your own physical, mental, and social well-being last. [Christiane Corriveau M.D., M.Ed.] (https://childrensnational.org/choose-childrens/find-a-provider/christiane-corriveau), a critical care physician, and [Hemant Sharma M.D., M.H.S.](https://childrensnational.org/choose-childrens/find-a-provider/hemant-sharma), an allergist and immunologist, chairs of the provider well-being initiative at [Children’s National Health System](https://childrensnational.org/), and Ayana Bennett, M.P.H., wellness program coordinator at Children’s National, host an AMA  on March 29 to provide strategies that can help you, your team, and medical center think differently about provider well-being, which helps providers and improves patient care.

It's clear that physician well-being is impacted far greater by systems issues than by issues of personal resilience. Eighty-percent of clinician burnout is systems driven. That being said, targeting personal resilience is an evidence-driven and necessary -- but not sufficient to improve physician well-being. 

We'll also talk about ways to navigate larger systemic changes, such as improving IT infrastructure and documentation, and to improve the culture of well-being in our health care organizations. We encourage doctors, medical students, and other clinicians to join. 

We welcome fresh ideas, innovative case studies, and look forward to the discussion.

pharmacy,"Stressed and anxious all the time, plus a bad performance review. I'm at a loss.","Throwaway because this is embarrassing as hell.

&amp;#x200B;

2018 grad working for CVStress as a staff at a store that was once the top store in the district and is now in the bottom 5 due to an entire staff turnover and unmotivated techs. I was told it would be low volume and essentially an easy store to handle but I just can't do it. We do about 1000 scripts a week but we only have one tech at the moment because two quit in the last few months and we have no replacements. I recently worked a 4 day stretch alone and cried almost every day during that period. I didn't sleep and dreamed about work every night. When I get stressed and anxious, my already limited customer service skills take a nosedive. I get short with people and just don't want to spend time talking when I have a million other things to do before closing. I tell people 2 hour wait times because I get stuck at the register for 40 minutes and can't fill anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I had my performance review and received ""Needs Improvement."" My previous PIC never communicated to me he was displeased with me. I'd text him how store visits with our DM went and I'd get no response. He'd say he wanted to call me to discuss an action plan and then never follow up. And then he hits me with a Needs Improvement saying my customer service skills suck and I need to focus more on that than other tasks in the pharmacy. I've gotten a few negative surveys about me and the one time my PIC followed up on one was basically just telling me to apologize to the patient. Didn't ask  for my side of the story or even care what happened. I was dumbstruck. My review wasn't delivered by him and was given to me by another manager who ultimately had no opinion on what was written because he didn't know me.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. I used to enjoy my days off but now I can't stop thinking about work and potentially getting a call from my DM saying I'm getting fired for bad surveys. I'm so paranoid about every customer interaction and I check our survey results multiple times a day when I'm working. I'm always afraid I'll walk into a negative comment about me and I'll lose my job over it. I'm depressed and anxious and I have no one to talk to about this other than my husband and my PIC. My PIC is supportive and knows I'm new and has expressed wanting to help me grow as a pharmacist. I feel like such a bitch for not being able to handle my store and having mental breakdowns every other day at work.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be appreciated (inb4 find another job). Retail is retail and I'm sure it'll be the same everywhere. I just don't know how to adapt to my current situation and not let things get to me like they do.",28,40,2019-03-28,PHARMA,0.3552438020706177,0.6207466125488281,0.024009553715586662

pharmacy,A tale of exploding vitamin D and tomatoes,"I want to preface this with: what the actual fuck?! I’ve been in pharmacy for over 20 years as a technician and pharmacist and manager and yet, this still surprises me.  

Regular comes in for his monthly pain medication. Tech tells him it’ll be about 30 minutes. Then, y’all know: shit hits the fan with phone calls, etc etc etc and his due time comes and goes. I walk out to the waiting area to let him know that I’m working on it yada yada and that we’d call him up as soon as it was ready; no need to get in line.  

About 3.2 minutes later, he decides to get out of the chairs and wheel his cart up behind someone at the second register, who is picking up their prescription like a normal human being.  He then stands between the two patients (one at each register, and his fucking cart is essentially trapping patient #2) and demands his prescription. Cashier says it’s almost ready, he says blah blah unacceptable and then. Then!  

He winds his cart back toward himself, and proceeds to SHOVE his cart as hard as he can. It flies about 25 feet until it slams into the steel shelving (warehouse)  and product, sending big ass bottles of vitamin D into a stupid mess.  Along with a tub of goddamn tomatoes that flew up out of the cart, hit the ground, and about 20 vine-ripened maters just exploded everywhere.  

Needless to say, I lost my mind. Stormed out there, said, “What are you doing?! You cannot do this at my pharmacy! I’m calling our warehouse manager over and you can take this up with him!  PICK THIS UP!!!” Y’all, I really said that. So proud of myself because he did!  Picked it up and then literally stood facing the product he’d smashed, his back to alllllll the patients shaking their heads, giving looks of JFC, etc.  

So. That was a small part of this weird Thursday. Hope y’all had less bull than me today... but I’d love to hear about your day too.  Thanks for reading!",22,71,2019-03-29,PHARMA,0.04025653377175331,0.9193947315216064,0.040348779410123825

medicine,"""Treat the man, not the scan"" related literature/books","Dear collective wisdom of Meddit,

We had a new registrar this week on the ward. They just got back from a couple of years in research. Their lack of clinical confidence was pretty evident and despite our best efforts to calm, convince and cajole, they essentially engaged in some of the most abhorrently defensive medicine I've seen since starting as a doc.

I'm talking:

- tiny adrenal incidentaloma on that CTCAP (described as ""of doubtful significance"" by radiologist) with normal biochem in a 90 lady done to r/o malignant causes of her obviously age-related swallow difficulties? Needs urgent endocrine opinion +/- MRI today

- isolated minor derangement of a single LFT in the context of nuking our patients with infected broad spectrum antibiotics and the rest? MRCP!

- 'biliary sludge' on a week old USS in patient admitted with alc hep (no fevers, no rigors, no RUQ pain) = we've missed cholecystitis, inform the family of our error and the liver surgeons must come now!

Essentially just a catalogue of looking at imaging or test results in total isolation from the clinical context, with certainly no regard to the tolerability of intensive investigation in elderly patients or even bothering to confirm any kind of occult symptoms that might corroborate the findings.

So I'm wondering if you might recommend some books or papers that make a persuasive, evidenced based argument for non-defensive medicine? Or a medicine that focusses on the basics? Basically what GPs and geriatricians do so well?

The two that come to mind which I've read is:

Jerome Groopman's ""How Doctors Think"" - but that's more about recognising the kind of cognitive errors that lead to misdiagnosis

Gigerenzer's ""Risk Savvy"" - again might be a bit too stats oriented

All thoughts greatly appreciated!
