Health,Daily Sinus Pain - Tried multiple medications and Doctors and I still hurt,"Hi,

I have suffered from daily sinus pain for a few months now. I have gone to doctors and taken allergy medication, cold medication, and other treatments such as hot steam. and none have worked.

The doctors have not been helpful though I am going to try again today. I am sick of this pain. It detracts from my life. Some googling has found this to be common problem with out many fixes. Do any redditors have any suggestions/tips on what is causing this or what can be done to relieve the pin?

Update: Went the doctor and had xrays of my head done. The results didn't show anything but the doc said that is not uncommon with sinus issues. He gave me a perscription for an antibiotic, a nasal spray and a Niel Med pump. I have used the Niel Med pump twice and the nasal spray. The pressure has been GREATLY reduced. If it comes back I'm to go for a CAT scan.

medicine,Is there anyone here who specializes in medical genetics and is willing to answer some questions about the profession?,"I am only pre-med right now, but genetics is perhaps the most interesting part of biology to me. It's a long ways away, but I think a medical genetic specialty would be very fun to pursue. But I have some questions.

* How do you typically spend your day? How much time is spent with patients and how much time is spent in the lab?
* How does this specialty differ most from other specialties?
* I have read that medical genetics ranks on the lowest end of the specialty spectrum as far as salary. How true is this and what are your thoughts on it?
* How competitive are medical genetics residencies?
* What is your favorite part about the profession?
* What do you see in the near future of the field? Far future?

My question is I keep hearing how primary care will not be a viable option and that there is a push for mid levels to take it over eventually. Is this really a good idea? I've worked with DNPs and PAs throughout my clinical rotations and while some of them were nice most really lacked a fundamental understanding of medical concepts. I really didn't see a difference in the work a Sub I student was doing compared to the mid levels in the outpatient or inpatient setting. There were so many times a student was able to ""out diagnose"" the NP or PA. I'm not opposed to the existence of midlevels but maybe they should have some pathway toward an MD degree. It just scared me sometimes that people with so little understanding of medicine were acting primary care providers.

He once mentioned that there was some literature showing - albeit based on a small sample, since the drug hasn't bee around that long - that long-term use of Plavix could be a very useful preventative measure in staving off a future heart attack (in conjunction, of course, with proper diet and exercise).

I can't seem to find references to such a study, or much on long-term use of Plavix at all. Are any of you familiar with these claims?

Health,"I'm 23. I have undiagnosed chronic pain and severe anxiety that are only escalating, and as a result have sent me into a depression that I can't cope with anymore. Suicide seems imminent. If you have any info that could help me, please share.","[throwaway account]I'm writing this after a year and a half of putting it on the back burner because I don't like to vocalize my issues because I feel that perpetuates them, and that makes me more apt to put myself in a hole. I’m not going to proof read it for that same reason. This will not tell the whole story. I've come to the end of the road where I am desperate and am out of options. I don't want to type for forever, but it seems I will have to in order to bring justice to the constant agony and miscommunications my brain and I have been going through. 

I've always had what I have been told is depression. Started going to counseling in fourth grade. I thought I didn't need it and ignored everything. I hadn't had my first drink until I was 18. When I went to college, I started drinking incessantly. By 19, I was drinking everyday and by 20, I was drinking a fifth a day to myself.

I am a musician. When I'm not working at a shit job for money, I'm recording for myself. It's my life. I taught myself to play around 17 and felt comfortable enough to start recording at 19 while I was in college. It was all I ever did. I was skipping my film classes to record in my basement. It became my reason for living and I was becoming confident. I decided to drop out of school because I was racking up debt for no reason and kept writing.

**November 2010**, while practicing for a string of shows we had coming up, I started noticing that when I played a certain song with a certain heavy 13 lb guitar slung over my left shoulder, my left arm would become very cold and weak while holding a barre on the first fret. I thought nothing of it because I was used to playing through pain because I have ganglions, and anyones hand gets tired when holding one chord for a long time.

Fast forward to **January 2011**, I wake up one day and my left index finger feels like I jammed it. The sides had pain and I was scared to bend it. I thought I was just drunk and didn't remember what I did. At practice that night, I couldnt play because the pain was so immense. I saw a hand surgeon who said it was carpal tunnel. It soon started to spread to my wrist and elbow along both median and ulnar nerve paths. Gave me a ""diagnostic"" cortisone shot to the wrist which did nothing but cause great pain and irritation and started **the numbness and tingling in my hand that I still have in my hand as I type now a year and a half later**. I then had an MRI on my wrist which showed nothing but the ganglions I knew I had. After another month of nothing but progressive numbness, **weakness** was becoming the big issue. I played guitar every day for years and years and suddenly I couldnt hold a glass of water. Depression set in without my guitar as my outlet for expression. I don't have many friends. My music is who I talk to the most. I was prescribed neurontin, which did absolutely nothing except black me out. Around this same time,  smaller labels were contacting me about my music I had released on the net for free, but upon finding out I could not tour while promoting my albums, I wasn’t contacted again.

**The biggest challenge is explaining my symptoms. The pain shifts from the middle of my arm pit as a pinching sensation with a little coldness to my scapula. It always feel like someone has stabbed me with an ice pick just under my arm pit on my side. The scariest thing to me is the weakness. My arm shakes insanely if I try to squeeze anything. There is always popping going on in my left arm whenever I move it even slightly and never the same as my right. In the region where it feels like there is an icepick, if I raise my right shoulder, what feels like a tendon popping over a joint sensation happens. I also have constant spasming in random areas of my shoulder, arm pit, scapulae, and forearm.**

**March-May 2011**, the pain traveled up to my shoulder and scapula and settled with a pinching sensation in my left arm pit region with a constant feeling like someone was pulling my armpit hair at all times. I'm an archaeologist for money, and digging was starting to become impossible. I was passed on to a neurologist who performed an EKG that came back negative and issued an MRI on my brachial plexus and my neck. Negative. Then I was prescribed Lyrica and sent to a vascular surgeon for **thoracic outlet symptoms**. He did a bunch of tests (after waiting a month and a half for an appointment because he works one day a month) and said nothing was wrong. They were attributing everything to an accident I had in 2009.

I was beginning to dabble with suicide. I already knew I drank too much, and I knew these were an alcoholics nightmare if they didn't want to die. Since the pain and weakness and cold feeling was never cured by pills and I was losing my mind, I would just drink and take pills until I just woke up the next day. I would black the day out, not really caring if I woke up, but hoping deep down that I did. All the while I was awake I was attempting to write my first electronic album since I couldn't play instruments to keep my mind off things.

**May 2011-April 2012** For the most part, I have lived in pain and dealt with it was well as I can. I started to try to come to terms with my condition and tell myself that someday I will wake up and it will all go away and be ok. I took the time that I couldn’t play guitar to build a studio which has kept me optimistic about what I can do when I can play again. I started seeing a chiropractor who Xray’d my neck and saw an insane **reverse curve** in my neck. After 2 weeks I couldn’t afford any more… around December 2011 the pain was too much and I started seeking physical therapy. I then started having **incapacitating panic attacks**, so bad I thought I was having a stroke the first time it happened. I was prescribed xanax, and I still have these panic attacks to this day.

**April 2012-Now** Beginning of April I was going 45 MPH on a motorbike and hit a patch of sand and gravel from the winter and hit my left shoulder first as well as nearly losing my left pinky. My bone was exposed and I thought I broke my jaw. Took my pinky 6 weeks to heal and the scar tissue still prohibits 100% full range of motion.

Now, the last straw has been pulled. I’m experiencing  ALL symptoms in my other arm now as well as my arm pits, my scapulae, and weakness. My neck hurts and I’m in too much pain. Every day for the past week has seemed like such a haze because I’m in a permanent state of panic. I’m constantly feeling death. **Every single doctor said “You’re too young to have these problems” and I’m thinking they are right.** And I just can’t live like this anymore. 7 different doctors and no one can help me… I feel like they don’t care enough. My music career is over without my arms. I can’t comfortably bathe myself and I’m 23. I have so much art in my head that I need to get out of me before I die, but the pain and panic attacks are debilitating. 
If anyone can offer a diagnosis or has had related symptoms and was cured, please, help me. Thanks.

medicine,Time to choose a specialty...,"Sorry in advance for the lengthy read. The time for residency applications is now only months away for me, but I have arrived at an impasse. I can't decide between my three specialty finalists: OBGYN, EM, and rural family medicine.

First, EM: I like the variety and the pace. EM fits my personality well. I am a bit turned off, however, by things like Press-Ganey scores and billboards encouraging use of emergency departments as primary care. Suits with MBAs coming down to hassle me about processing times and ""customer satisfaction"" at the expense of good medicine is a real downer for this awesome specialty.

OBGYN: When I look up on the board right now during my EM rotation, the SOB, the abdominal pain, and the dislocated shoulder all look equally interesting to me. There are few aspects of medicine I don't like. When an OBGYN case pops up, however, I am drawn to it. It is more interesting. I know the field better than others, I want to learn it yet even more. When OBGYN comes down on a consult, I find myself wanting to bail on that serial detox request case I am working up and follow OBGYN in to learn more. I love the clinical aspect, and I love the surgical aspect. The only downside? I give up treating men and children.

Rural family medicine offers the chance to do a bit of everything. They often staff rural emergency departments, and see OBGYN cases as one of the few providers for an area. The intrusive administrator problems are solved in that you serve as your own administrator. Running your own practice can limit your flexibility in taking time off, though. I also dislike geriatrics, particularly the futile end-of-life care that so often occurs, as much as I enjoy obstetrics and gynecology. Geriatrics is a big part of FM (and EM).
Do you have thoughts of your own which might help me decide?

tldr; Can't decide. Emergency Medicine, OBGYN, or Rural Family Medicine?",20,15,2012-05-18,PHARMA,0.06967610865831375,0.9033689498901367,0.026954930275678635

medicine,Is Med school more like a trade school than a University Degree?,"Sorry, I really of course do not intend to offend anyone with this question. It is simply just that - a question! I hardly think the moniker trade school is offensive to begin with anyway.

OK so I'm in University, and I don't study Medicine. I'm very friendly with a lot of med students though. But more and more, I keep thinking that they're degree seems much more like a trade school setup than a University degree setup. A really really hard trade school. 

Most of the med students I know are very smart people; fairly inevitably I guess since that's almost a prerequisite for entry. However now all they seem to do is learn stuff off by heart! Or else, get good at techniques for healing people etc. It seems very difficult, and it'll be great for them when they're doctors. But lots of things are very difficult and with great payoff, it's hardly what makes something a university degree.

Am I completely off-base here? Am I just too out of the loop to properly understand how medicine really works? I mean, it just doesn't seem to have the ""main"" [warning: pretty subjective definition here] elements of what I would consider a University degree.

EDIT: I'm really sorry if anything I say comes off as disrespectful. I sincerely do not mean it to be that way. Alas, I possibly have to leave now. Thank you for your well thought-out points!

EDIT: I'm guessing this thread has worn itself out at this stage. Thanks again for your points. Bit childish of some people to downvote some comments, since they're clearly pure opinion. Rightly or wrongly, most of the comments with structure here have in fact strengthened my views rather than weakened them. Perhaps this comes from a misunderstanding of what trade schools are like? I don't know.

Also: prerequisite is not an ""if and only if"" statement, and all the things which I (and most other people regard) as part of a classical (/traditional/standard) university degree are obviously on a sliding scale too.",36,5,2012-05-26,PHARMA,0.05085843428969383,0.916466474533081,0.03267508000135422

Health,Early Wart,"Hey guys, I've had a few plantar warts in the past, one on my finger and one on my toe, but they both finally dissipated last year. Unfortunately, I believe I've spotted another one in the very early stages on the same finger as my first. It began as a little raised piece of skin, I scratched that bit off and it left a small red spot, normal. However as it has healed back, I've noticed the small red spot has darkened and sort of ""seperated"" it's self from the surrounding skin, the little speck is slightly recessed from the surrounding skin. I once again tried to scratch that off(foolish), but it was very difficult to do that. Now, I've scratched it off and theres a small recessed area, kind of like a scoop of skin, missing from my finger with the same red spot at the center. I'm feeling quite suspicious that this is indeed a plantar wart in te early stages. So, my question to you r/health, is there anything I can do to just ""nip it at the bud"" in this case? I absolutely do not want to spend another year of my life with a cancer on my hand, nor do I wish to receive another scar by removal. Please help me r/health, I fucking hate these things.

medicine,Female Doctors of Reddit: I need career advice.,"Female (and any male who would like to weigh in) doctors of Reddit, I'm facing a quandary. When I completed my final year of high school, I had the marks for undergrad medicine (I'm in Australia, education system is different - we go straight from school to university). However, my hometown didn't offer the Premed exam, and I couldn't get to one that did. So I figured, I'll do one year of nursing (offered at my hometown university) and apply for a transfer. I then found I enjoyed my classes, and the work I did on clinicals, so I completed my Bachelor of Nursing/Bachelor of Arts/Science. I've done three years hard work at my state's top hospital, in both Cardiology/Cardiothoracic Surgery and now in Emergency and Trauma. During that time I've completed a couple of units post grad study.

However, the option of Medicine has never left my mind. I don't know whether it's because I want to prove to myself I could do it, or because it really is my dream job. But I'm not fulfilled doing what I'm doing now, and I have no innate desire to continue down the traditional route of nursing career development (postgrad degree, ANUM, NUM etc). The thought of studying Medicine still excites me, and when working with the doctors around me I can't help but think 'I wish I could be there, making those decisions, taking my knowledge that big step further.'

Having researched it, assuming I do well on my premed exam and interviews, I could enter and complete my post graduate medical degree by 30, starting my internship at 31. On one level, I think that's a great age to be doing it. On another, it makes me think; if I'm an intern at 31, at what age am I going to be making decent money (I'd be making what I am now, only 6 years on)? At what age would I be able to take a break, start a family? Is taking this course going to scuttle my chances of having a family, am I going to end up married to my job? On some level I know that this shouldn't be an issue if I was really certain about medicine, that I should just want to do it no matter what. But it does factor into my decision making.

I don't have any female friends who are doctors. I would love to hear from some of you out there who are doing it, facing this issue and finding your way through it.

I've googled the problem and I went to doctors, dermatologists, and gynecologists, but none of them knew what it is. Some subscribed ointments that did nothing, and others just said ""it is something you will live with forever.""  

It's been 10 years and each yearly doctor's appointment, I get the same answer. Since then they have moved to my armpits as well, but not as severe.  Not only are boils down there but there are these black head like lumps that when I squeeze, white thick paste stuff comes out. Sometimes it wont be a black head but just a lump that the same pasty discharge comes out. There are a lot of these too, like 20 in a few inches of skin.    

Its easily my biggest insecurity. The area down there is a scarred up mess with the normal sores.  I've tried looking for answer everywhere but haven't come up with anything. I certainly can't be the only one with this, that's just silly. If anyone has any comments or advice or anything really, I'd really appreciate it.    

You stay classy, Reddit.
