medicine,Physician-Scientists/Pathologists/Experts: Why *don't* we have a screen for HPV in men?,"As the rate of HPV related oral cancers in men continues to increase steadily (something I can personally attest to seeing, though the data is clear) and it continues to spread largely asymptomatically, what are the technical limitations for developing a male HPV screen? 

Are buccal cells not as revealing as cervical cells on swap/scrape? Or is it cost-related? Does anyone have any insight into the major hurdle, aside from getting patients and the general public to accept that HPV vaccines are ok for men? (Or that vaccines are safe at all... sigh). Though I'm a medical student, I'm asking more from the perspective of a researcher (as that was my profession pre-medical school, and still plays a significant role in my life).

pharmacy,"If you accidentally mixed up two patients' medications, how would you react?","Here's a little backstory: I'm currently volunteering in a retail pharmacy and a couple days ago, another assistant accidentally switched two patients' medications and handed them the other person's medications instead of their own. One of the patients noticed and came back really angry. However, when confronted, the pharmacist didn't seem to know how to react and handled the situation badly (like stuttering, took forever to think of what to say and avoided eye contact etc).

I guess my question is this: As a pharmacist, what is the proper way to react in such a situation?

pharmacy,Anyone else feel like they're gearing up for battle when getting ready for work?,"Maybe it's just being down in south FL at the epicenter of the opioid crisis, but nowadays it just feels like every day I spend over half my time battling drug addicts trying to fill obviously inappropriate prescriptions. The fun in the job is gone. Totally.

I try to do my due diligence with these ""patients"", have a conversation with them about the risks, call their doctors, but it's getting to the point where I don't want to waste my time anymore when I know I'm not going to fill the prescriptions anyway. Literally over half of my day is spent dealing with this.

I should just say ""I don't have it"", but I try to be honest and document my attempts to reconcile red flags like my supervisor wants. But then like clockwork they want corporate's number, which means I'll be soon having another conversation with my supervisor reciting the same notes I left on the patient's profile, wasting even more time in a day that doesn't have enough time or help.

medicine,Working in a small community,"I would love some commiseration, perspective, and ideas from others who work in large small towns. Not rural and remote where everyone has a long way to go to access care, but small enough that there are rarely many different options. As in: we have a community hospital that is not entirely podunk, but major things get shipped out. We have a busy Ob-Gyn office, for instance, but just the one. There is a bigger regional health system trying to move in on our local hospital so we are starting have one alternative for certain specialties, but seeing and being seen by friends/colleagues/family members as patients is pretty unavoidable. Running into patients out in public is a multiple-times-per-day occurrence. 

Most of the time I don't mind having a patient greet me in public. Usually it's something sweet or appropriate like ""hey! you saw my son when he broke his wrist last year! you were so great!"" But recently I had one seek me out in the locker room at the gym while I was standing at the swimsuit spinner stark-ass naked and telling me all about their dietary changes and health goals. They kept walking away but then coming up with something *else* to say and coming back. 

I deeply dislike having to see the family members of my current or past coworkers. I don't even mind seeing the actual coworkers, but the burden of responsibility for their loved ones and the potential that our friendship or work relationship will get in the way of effective communication and good decision-making weighs on me.

Perhaps the hardest part for me has been seeking my own health care. I delayed addressing my slipping mood for much longer than I should have because my fantastic primary care office (NOT where I work -- I don't shit where I eat) has only 2 physicians/APPs that I haven't worked with before. If I needed anything remotely complex I would travel out of town, but it is just not tenable to try to get regular basic health care 1.5 - 2 hours away. 

Sorry this turned into a rant, but I would really appreciate ideas for how to deal with (or even just change my attitude about) this situation. Also, vignettes about wildly inappropriate patients in public places are most welcome.",6,31,2019-05-02,PHARMA,0.05728880316019058,0.9154136180877686,0.027297591790556908

pharmacy,Is the fear of being sued rational?,"I've noticed quite a few posts and comments on this sub that concern me regarding the risk of being sued. It seems to be a significant stressor for a lot of folks and that's the last thing you guys need. I'm an attorney but I don't do malpractice. My wife is an MD and one of my good friends is a pharmacist. 

Anyway, I thought I'd share the official number of paid claims related to pharmacists in 2018 according to the us government. It's 39 paid claims for the entire year and there are 312,500 pharmacists. 25 of those were for less than 50k. That equates to a risk of 0.01248% per pharmacist in 2018.

Note that the above figure only accounts for paid claims through settlement or judgment, not the total for all lawsuits. Generally 70% of malpractice claims end in no payment so the risk of being named in a lawsuit is higher but not drastically so. 

What's not particularly surprising is that the malpractice insurance company reports try to hide or manipulate the actual risk since that'd be bad for business. They also probably don't want you to know the first thing a malpractice attorney checks is how much coverage you have because the more you have, the more likely you are going to be sued. 

Anyway, I hope the information helps. If you are covered by your employers insurance, from a legal standpoint, you are probably throwing your money away to a multibillion dollar insurance company. Imo, you'd be better off organizing a real advocacy group for your profession and using the money for that purpose since you folks are getting screwed by a couple pharmacy chains, PBMs, etc...

medicine,How Many Times can a Child get Croup?,"I had a particularly unpleasant consult with an unwell child the other day and I would appreciate your opinions on it:

A mum brought her 3 year old boy to our family clinic the other day. I had never met either of them before. As they walked in I could see that the child appeared well (good color, no shortness of breath, walked in normally and sat down, said 'hi' and was smiling). Because of how well he seemed I relaxed.

Mum opens by saying that the kid has ""croup"" and needs prednisolone.

Ok I thought. What does the ""cough sound like?""

""It's a seal-like barking cough"", she states.

I thought that was a bit odd and that she must have heard it from a doctor at some point. I got the rest of the history from them. In summary he had a runny nose for a few days and then starting with a dry ""seal-like barking cough"" had started infrequently over the last 24 hours. No stridor or shortness of breath. No fevers and was eating and drinking well.

I then examined the child and apart from a runny nose everything was normal: Appears well, no stridor, good hydration, vitals normal including temperature, no meningism, ears and throat looked normal, chest clear. The only thing was a bit of a runny nose. I did not witness a single cough during the 20 minutes they were there.

I then spent about 15 minutes discussing about how I thought there was a *possibility* that this wasn't croup and that maybe she was interpreting a regular cough as a croupy cough. My plan was to treat this conservatively with rest, fluids and acetaminophen and have them return or go to emergency if he was starting to get worse - particularly if he developed shortness of breath/stridor. She didn't take this too well and in the end we agreed on a backpocket script for pred that she could take home and give him if he started to get worse.

The next day I received a formal complaint from her about me with all kinds of accusations like I was putting her child in harm's way by not giving the pred, not knowing what croup was, by seeming that I made her feel unwelcome that she was even there (in reality I was stunned at how she yelled at this kid to sit down when they arrived). During the consult she also punched the kid in the arm hard with a closed fist because he wriggled in his chair a bit (ADHD) - but that is not the topic of this post.

During my time writing a response to the complaint, I went back through all of the notes that we had on this child. In his 3 years of life he had been brought to our clinic almost 50 times with some variation of viral illnesses - runny noses, AOM, viral induced wheeze etc and had received approximately 20 courses of antibiotics. Looking through the notes I also found that the child has also been given **12** courses of prednisolone for croup. Every single instance was the same: mum brought in child saying he has a ""seal-like barking cough"", he looks completely well to the doctors, sometimes a mild non-croupy cough was heard but never any stridor and vitals and examination always normal except for sometimes a mild fever. However, each time he was prescribed prednisolone seemed to have been due to mum reporting a ""seal-like barking cough.""",156,426,2019-05-07,PHARMA,0.12189222872257233,0.854706346988678,0.023401349782943726

medicine,How do you evaluate the quality of a research article?,"I am not a doctor or medical student, but I have been reading a lot of  medical studies recently to become a more informed patient. I read one  study (which I unfortunately can't find at the moment) about doctors'  attitudes towards a drug depending on different characteristics of  studies they read on the drug, and doctors cited quality of methods used  in the study as an important factor in their willingness to prescribe a  drug. This is encouraging news. I was wondering, however, what the  criteria are that most doctors (or you personally) have for a  high-quality research study. I know randomization helps to minimize  differences between treatment groups and having a double-blind study is  helpful, but beyond that, I am not sure what makes a study high-quality,  and of course there can be high-quality studies that are neither of  those things.

medicine,Can this lowly MS3 encourage you with his experience in the PICU?,"WARNING: LONG POST! Part of this story has been fictionalized to maintain the anonymity of the patients/families affected.

The day started with the usual: a sugar-free caramel breve with five shots of espresso as I begrudgingly walked from the in-hospital coffeeshop to PICU – where I had been assigned for the week - to make 6:45 rounds. The day ended with the usual: the local diner’s waitress vacuuming around me twenty minutes prior to midnight, while secretly hoping that I pack up my laptop and go home, so that she can close up shop a few minutes early. And in-between was a day unlike any I had ever experienced before; it was a purpose-defining day filled with incredible heartbreak, intense confusion, and truly extraordinary patient care.

I have the terrible habit of forgetting why I chose medicine. For fleeting moments, I forget that it’s all about the patient. And this morning was one of those moments. I put together my presentation on my patient – an eight-week-old female - and had my note 95% done, all before seeing her. I ran into my patient’s room, did a quick and dirty three-minute exam and rushed out when I saw her mom coming from down the hall, because I knew that she would want to talk for a while and rounds were starting in two minutes.

During rounds, I delivered my best presentation yet and gave myself a pat on the back. This was followed by my resident heaping praise on me, which, in turn, triggered my attending to do the same. All this praise for a student who got into this field because he had a passion for talking with people, but ducked out of his patient’s room to avoid that very thing. Rounds were long and painful today; they lasted until 1 pm. This gave me plenty of time to snag lunch prior to our back-to-back meetings that lasted from 2-4 pm. I decided to reward myself for such a “great presentation,” by leaving campus for a burger. O, how awesome am I?!

During these meetings – where I was barely paying attention – they discussed stopping ECMO on a patient that was not mine. I, uninvested, returned to trying to sneakily complete a few anki cards on my phone. We get up to do afternoon rounds at 4 pm and we start with this ECMO patient, an eight-month old male who just three weeks ago was completely healthy. He presented to the ED with grunting that was later revealed to be myocarditis, and by a twist of fate, he’s now on ECMO. His prognosis is dismal and his parents, newlyweds, have decided to stop ECMO.

When we arrive at this patient’s room, I immediately snap out of this disgusting, arrogant, fleeting moment of apathy when I realize that his parents are absent. They asked to be called before we stopped ECMO and alerted of the results after we stopped ECMO. Yes, they are aware that he’s not likely to survive this event. I immediately transition from arrogant apathy to judgmental rage. “How could they not be here for him?” “He’s all alone!” With no regard for what this poor couple has been through, I – a man fortunate enough to have a perfectly healthy daughter – turn up my nose at this couple.

My attending, however, is a phenomenal physician and has a compassionate, brilliant revelation. She does what we all should have; she put herself in this poor couple’s shoes. She explains to us that this couple should not have to show up to see their son laying dead all alone. She, thinking out loud, articulates that someone should be holding him. I, without even thinking, volunteer. As I begin gowning up, all the judgment washes off of me. The only thing I feel, as I walk into this room, is purpose. If this is the only thing that I was put on this Earth to do, then so be it. My mission, right now, is to be there for this baby and demonstrate to his parents, who cannot handle the gravity of the situation, that he was loved, even in his final moments.

So the pediatric CT surgeon gets to work removing ECMO. The pediatric intensivist – my attending – brilliantly manages his hemodynamics like a top-notch anesthesiologist. And for a moment, it appears that he may somehow survive without ECMO. But then the oxygen saturation begins to tank. The blood pressure spikes, only to plummet. I wipe the tears from my face and grab him. I hold him like he is my own child. I rock him back and forth, I sing to him, I pray. The monitor flatlines. There is no long beep like in the movies, there is only silence. Thirty minutes pass before his parents arrive. I hand him to his mother, hug his father, and walk away.

Before leaving the hospital, I went back into my original patient’s room and waited two hours for her mom to return from her afternoon errands. I introduce myself to her, re-explain her daughter’s upcoming procedure to her, and ask her if she has any questions. I almost walk out the room after she says no, but something still didn’t feel right. I ask her if she needed anything and she jokingly responds with “a nap.” So prior to leaving the hospital for the day, I grabbed her a blanket and pillow. She smiles and thanks me for being a “good person.” I quickly correct her and explain to her that I wasn’t a good person this morning when I ducked out of the room. I apologize and leave the hospital.

On a day, where I forgot why I got into medicine, I found my purpose. I am heartbroken as I write this. I am heartbroken that this little boy died without his mother present. I am heartbroken that these two young newlyweds have to experience such hurt. I am heartbroken that I began this day with such arrogance, apathy, and judgment. I am simultaneously grateful. I am grateful that I was able to be there for this precious little boy. I am grateful that I had an opportunity to apologize to my patient's mother. I am grateful that I was able to make someone's day just slightly more bearable. I share my experience with you because I hope it gives you a reminder that we got into this field to interact with and help people who are hurting.

medicine,Submassive (but huge) PE found by dumb luck,"I don't know how to feel about this. I recall an EM physician not too long ago posted a similar story so I wanted to share mine.

I'm in IM. I was doing some moonlighting one night when a lady comes in for hypertensive emergency. Her SBP is &gt;200 and she has a headache. All her other vital signs are rock solid. She has elevated trops and an elevated BNP. I trend the tropes out and first they are level, and then start dropping as we get control of her pressures with a nicardipine drip (slow early decrease, aimed for no less than 160 for the night). A CT head has no bleed. Not any other end organ damage. 

SpO2 98% on RA the whole time. HR comfortably in the 70s-80s, and she's on a baby dose of metop xl 25 at home. She was given an extra metop short-acting 25 in the ED for the HTN. 

Never any chest pain, SOB. Had a cough she reported in the morning without sputum, or hemoptysis. She did have some palpitations, that was it. She gives me this strange history of polyuria as well over the last 24 hrs, which she makes a point to emphasize. Telemetry was rock solid normal. An EKG was identical to one done a year ago. The patient herself looks awesome. Pleasant, interactive. Nothing to suggest anything more serious going on that what's been presented.

Her exam is totally normal except for a slightly elevated JVP that I got at maybe 8 CM, and a positive hepatojugular reflex. She doesn't have any CHF history and overall I would call her exam euvolemic to slightly dry, so I was at first thrown off by that finding but I couldn't put it together with anything else I was seeing. So in my mind I'm thinking, she's older, maybe there's just some pulmonary HTN or something. I'm going to let her drink to thirst and I see no reason to diurese. 

I see she has a history of thoracic descending aortic aneurysm, which was imaged about a month ago and stable but ever so slowly growing. She starts telling me she has left shoulder pain. Exacerbated by movement. I'm thinking: ok this is totally MSK pain. I pour over this for like 2-3 hours. HTN emerg. Descending aneurysm. Left shoulder pain. Trops. And the nurse is telling me she's been up all night back and forth urinating, producing small amounts but constantly doing it, consistent with the polyuria in the ROS. 

So I finally pull the trigger and CTA her, just to put my mind at ease about the aneurysm. I chalk the trops to a type II NSTEMI and rationalize that she is not having an ACS so I don't need to give her anticoagulation. 

A couple of times her BP drops to like normotensive levels suddenly, making the nicardipine stop. Then it gets restarted when it goes back up. I don't think much of this except to make sure she's not stroking out. It's already been much more than 6 hours since presentation so I don't get too worried about those drops.

I follow up the next day and -great- the aneurysm is stable. But BOOM PE in the right main pulmonary artery. Signs of right heart strain! Wtf!

It was just dumb luck. So now of course the right-sided heart findings on exam makes sense. But that's it. How utterly jarring and unnerving. I'm wondering if I missed this. Should I have acted on my exam? How the hell does this cause HTN emerg? Should I have started the AC on the type II NSTEMI? I feel like this could have gone VERY badly and honestly it is terrifying.",86,159,2019-05-09,PHARMA,0.08639716356992722,0.8827832341194153,0.030819624662399292

medicine,A case of missed poisoning by propylene glycol,"I'm at a small clinic for my student internship. I'm lazily strolling through routine follow ups when a young woman walks in, accompanied by her boyfriend, complaining of severe light headedness, nausea and vomiting small amounts of frank blood since waking up. She had been vomiting daily (not blood) for the past week and gives a history of peptic ulcer disease, though she denies melena stools. 

She's not pale, but obviously dehydrated. Pulse is over 100 and systolic is in the 90s so we can't rule out an upper GI bleed in addition to dehydration. We start a normal saline infusion and push 10mg metoclopramide IVI as we wait for an ambulance (we don't have the facilities to do a blood gas or urgent blood tests, let alone endoscopy).

On further history, she had hernia repair surgery two months ago, though she can't say which type. Abdominal exam reveals a ~5cm vertical scar above the umbilicus and mild epigastric tenderness. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient seems a bit disinhibited, which we chalk up to dehydration and possible hemorrhage  (she denied any substance use). 

I happened to meet the paramedic who transferred the patient the next day. Turns out the Hb was normal, blood gas revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis and toxicology screen was positive for propylene glycol. It wasn't clear yet whether this was a suicide attempt or a poisoning attempt.

medicine,When families turn hostile,"No personal details to follow, but I have to vent. 

I’m looking for advice on how to handle situations when families (and patients) turn hostile to their caregivers. 

After months of progressive decline, we have solved a complicated case and are working towards discharge and treatment. The diagnosis is devastating and has been tough to accept for everyone involved, including my team. 

Despite our honest-to-goodness best efforts and diligent hard work, the family has started verbally attacking us for petty issues (again - I’m leaving out details). I understand this is probably them venting frustration and projecting onto us, but it is draining my morale and I am finding that I no longer want to care for the patient or their family. 

What is the limit that you will tolerate? What do you do when conversations are recorded without consent? How much abuse will you take when you are only doing your job? Can these situations be diffused?

The OP described a pharmacist interrogating patients over medications they were prescribed and was systematically attacked for daring to criticize the pharmacist, particularly for questioning a pharmacist’s place to undermine a doctor’s decision to prescribe certain medications. I was shocked by the scathing reaction in the comments and the seeming lock-step ideology pronounced by those working in the retail pharmacy field.

The ones I've worked with recommended, dosed, and safety-fied so many medication regimens of mine, which is basically what I'm supposed to be doing.

pharmacy,Walmart not filling my Rx,"I am beyond furious and would like some perspective. I was notified by my patient that Walmart would no longer fill Rx from me. So naturally I called that Walmart. (I am a NP in pain management group)... the pharmacist I spoke with was quite rude and blunt, telling me I am a high prescriber and that this particular patient diagnosis code is always low back pain.  She then said “nobody needs oxycodone #120 for LBP. “.... I reminded her that I am chronic pain management. I reminded  her that less than a year ago he was on fentanyl 50 plus Hydro for breakthrough.  I reminded her we have tapered to discontinuation the fentanyl, and now his MMED is 60. (Was over 100).... nonetheless she accused me of being a high prescriber, etc then told me she had to go. Bye.

Anyways— I have worked diligently in the past year in pain mgmt to get all my patients down. I do not have anyone over 120 MMED; and only a handful between 90-120.... my fentanyl patients have all been tapered slowly and safely off... same with my methadone patients. I am careful to not over Rx, and am working at tapering even oxy patients who take only for arthritis. But it is a hard battle.
      If one Walmart will no longer fill my Rx, I assume no Walmart will? And if I ever leave pain management and go into another field and write abx and lisinopril etc will I be able to have my Rx filled once again?

Super bummed. I barely even like pain management. But after this- I’m really rethinking.... all the patients who used to be MMED 200 or more— and Walmart bans me for MMED 60....
    Oh, and I do need to be more specific than low back pain. I do understand that now. Thanks for letting me vent.

medicine,Clinical boundaries re: death of a patient?,"Three years ago, as an oncology volunteer, I got to know my patients quite well. One was particularly fond of long conversations. He enjoyed sharing his life stories and adventures. I volunteered almost everyday, and he, his roommate and I would spend hours sharing stories and jokes and sometimes singing. (It was all completely within the realm of what volunteers do in this program.)

Near the end of my stint, he gave me a handwritten note expressing his best wishes.

Limiting the information I write; but, he worked in an industry that suffered a major accident some years ago. His illness (and ultimate passing) were a delayed result of that accident. The note he gave me was written on a postcard from that industry, and he signed his name alongside the name of his specific company/workplace.

After a few months, I left the volunteer position.

Just recently, I found the card again and google-searched his name (it was impulsive; I understand now this was a HIPAA violation). I learned that he passed away. I was and still am devastated; he was a person with incredible integrity. I feel an impulse to grieve somehow -- I carry his card with me; I visited a memorial for his industry, and wandered around for hours, crying a little and remembering our time.

But I am afraid this is all inappropriate and boundary-crossing. I broke HIPAA by searching his name and learning information I was not entitled to (although.... if he gave me a signed card with his name, and I searched based on that information not information from the hospital, is that still HIPAA-breaking?).

**It also seems really inappropriate to visit the memorial or 'grieve' someone who I had a purely clinical relationship with.**

Am I correct that reading about a former patient online, carrying the card and visiting a memorial are inappropriate? Should I be backing off and/or addressing my own boundary issues with a psychologist to prevent future boundary-crossing?

Or, is it in fact acceptable and normal to 'grieve' a patient in this manner?

One more question: He really wanted me to meet his wife, and her to meet me, because she was so important to him and appeared in all his stories (and apparently enjoyed telling her about his volunteer as well). When she visited, he made a point of introducing us, and we all sat together and shared stories. I assume it would be inappropriate and/or HIPAA-non-compliant to contact his wife, share some memories, and extend my condolences?

I have also been tempted to walk by the company/workplace he signed in his note, just to see what it the place was like that meant so much to him. Would that be wrong as well?

medicine,Observations (okay it is a rant against pseudomedicine) about outpatient medicine from a hospitalist turned PCP,"I've transitioned to primary care from hospital medicine and boy has it been a transition. Overall I love it but coming from an academic bubble to hospital medicine and now to outpatient has been eye opening. 

Both jobs are difficult, and I hate the pissing match about which is harder (Primary care vs hospitalist). I can have a ton of complaints about hospital medicine but I wanted to rant for a bit about what outpatient medicine has seemed to become or be in my neck of the woods.

 I have a new practice, opened doors in 2018. So far I've seen about 2500 new patients in about 9 months. I would consider myself well trained and open to discuss many evidence based non traditional techniques with patients if they are interested.

I've noticed quite a few patients who come from other doctors who have what I would consider BS diagnosis such as 

1. ""leaky gut syndrome""
2. ""seronegative chronic lyme disease""
3. ""adrenal fatigue""
4. ""HPA axis mismatch/dysregulation"" (with all normal blood tests. Theory is that the mismatch occurs at various times of day and that labs don't always pick up on that so I'm told by some patients who were told by their other doctor)
5. ""chronic EBV infection""



These diagnosis appear to be pushed by local doctors who bill themselves as functional medicine doctors. I've looked up all of these doctors online and they all are cash pay, are board certified MD's, and all sell their own supplements. One is an OBGYN, one is an ENT, and 2 others in my area are family practice all practicing as functional medicine doctors giving patients these types of diagnosis.


Many of these patients keep buying these supplements pushed by these doctors and stool genetic assay tests to determine ""how healthy their gut biome is"" and to me this is bordering on unethical since I don't know exactly what seems to be going on. I've requested records from their clinic but not once have they ever faxed me a record. One clinic in particular has a print out of the same 5 diagnosis and 5 treatment plans. He circles whichever he diagnosis the patient with, circles treatment plan and which supplement of his they should buy. I only found this out after a patient brought the form in to my clinic from what one of these doctors gave them.

Another group in town deals with mental health but has started to do bio identical hormones and botox.

Coming from an academic center, what in the hell has happened to outpatient medicine? Is this just isolated to my area or is this a problem all over the US? 

I have to spend so much time talking these people about why they don't have adrenal fatigue and the fact that they are tired all day is most likely from being on their phone/computer, and having terrible sleep hygiene or anxiety. 

Dealing with chronic pain and benzos seekers seems to be so much easier than dealing with these patients who are convinced that all labs are wrong and that their functional medicine doctor knows better than every other doctor.

Quoted from FB:

A colleague recently pointed out that NPs under the new contracts are getting paid better than the MD equivalent.


Nurse Practitioner (1.0 FTE, pay your own overhead)

Year 1: $235,000 for a minimum panel of 500 ($470 per patient)

Year 3: $245,000 for a minimum panel of 1000 ($245 per patient)


Family Physician (1.0 FTE, pay your own overhead)

Year 1: $250,000 for a minimum panel of 800 ($312.50 per patient)

Year 3: $265,000 for a minimum panel of 1250 ($212 per patient)


So, the current state of matters is:

1. Naturopaths have a legal scope nearly identical to MDs to prescribe drugs, order tests and perform minor surgery (albeit not publically funded but they do sneaky stuff like bill botox through extended health under ""naturopath services"")

2. Midwives get paid more to do maternity care than I do (per patient: $1060.01 for prenatal care, $1,060.01 for labour and delivery, $1,060.01 for postpartum care)

3. Now nurse practitioners who have less training are being paid more than MDs to provide care to patients of lower complexity",167,158,2019-05-15,PHARMA,0.1051737517118454,0.8657293319702148,0.029096953570842743

medicine,The ACGME has failed us. Disband it. Let the Government regulate GME.,"It's often said that medicine is one such field that has the privilege of regulating itself. We do this by empowering private ""non-profit"" corporations(ACGME, LCME, ABMS, etc) to monopolize control over deciding the way we can practice. But I'm not convinced that the government would be any worse.

After all, we're talking about an arena(Graduate Medical Education) which is funded mostly -to the tune of over 10 billion dollars annually- by the US government, in the form a massive subsidy to hospitals, to cover the costs of resident training. Why not let the government regulate it, instead of an out-of-touch, unaccountable private corporation like the ACGME? After all, it is the US taxpayer who is footing the bill. There are substantial built-in advantages to government oversight, in the form of accountability and oversight from the legislative and executive branches. Also consider that the Freedom of Information Act guarantees transparency in operations, something absent from a private org like the ACGME.

Why rely on this monopolistic private corporation, which is only minimally accountable to a slew of private stake-holders and practically accountable to none? What has the ACGME done for us? They've failed to meaningfully address resident wellness and well-being in the form of common-sense duty hour restrictions and fair pay standards. The working and pay conditions medical residents are subjected to are antithetical to federal labor law. But the hospital lobby long ago got us written off as an exemption; no over-time pay protections for us.

medicine,"Homeopathy is a total fraud, and a cruel way to exploit people who are desperately looking for help.","#Why it doesn't work

Essentially, homeopathy is based on the belief that **like cures like**. In practice, this would mean that different symptoms would be treated using small amounts of substances that in bigger doses would cause them.

I do acknowledge that this ""like cures like"" principle has been scientifically researched, with the name **hormesis**. Because of these studies, it's widely accepted that a small amount of a substance can in some cases have a different effect on a cell than a higher dose. However, we don't know how rare this phenomenon is, and the alternate effect it causes isn't necessarily positive or desired at all. 

Practicioners of homeopathy generalize this very unclear and controversial theory by thinking anything that causes a symptom can cure it in low doses. For example, in 2018, naturopath and homeopathic practicioner Anke Zimmermann gave a 4-year-old boy a remedy containing the saliva of a rabid dog, to treat the boy's supposed anger management issues (which, by the way, are perfectly natural for children that age), aggression and poor sleep, claiming that the solution ""cured"" him. If the remedy actually contained the virus, this woman was literally endangering a child's life for some crazy pseudoscientific experiment, while probably charging the parents a significant sum of money for it.

Additionally, there is another, arguably even bigger problem with homeopathy. Homeopathic medicine is produced using a method called ""potentization."" This means mixing 1 part of the desired ingredient with 9 parts of water, then shaking the solution, then mixing 1 part of the mixture with 9 parts of water again, and repeating this process over and over again. Homeopaths claim that the less of the ingredient the final solution contains, the more effective it is. This leads to the ingredients being diluted into nonexistence: in almost all homeopathic remedies, not a single molecule remains of the original ingredient. And even remedies that do have something else than water or alcohol in them only contain a couple of molecules of it: not enough to cause any effect. Again, none of this has been scientifically proven to work, but to be honest, homeopathic ""doctors"" don't seem to care about science anyway.


#Research on homeopathy

Most medical institutions around the world have rejected homeopathy as pseudoscientific nonsense, and rightfully so. In 2015, Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council, one of the world's biggest and most respected health institutions, conducted a massive study on homeopathy, with over 1800 different studies systematically analyzing papers and documents related to the topic. They concluded that there was ""no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy is effective in treating health conditions.""
The NHMRC had already come to the same conclusion earlier, in 2014, when they found homeopathy to have no effect in treating any of the 68 different health conditions included in the study.
In 2010, BMJ (earlier known as the British Medical Journal) wrote an article proving that complementary medicines, such as homeopathy, are absolutely useless as substitutes for conventional medicine.
Even back in 2002, the British Pharmacological Society debunked homeopathy as completely ineffective.

BPS article 2002:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874503/

These were only a few examples of the overwhelming majority of evidence clearly showing that homeopathy has no real curative powers. It's a fact at this point.

Most of, if not all of the ""evidence"" supporting homeopathy, however, is based on people's personal experiences. The problem with this is that these experiences originate from the subjective viewpoints of people who might be biased towards homeopathy, thinking it cured them for sure, when in reality there are tons of other possible reasons to someone recovering from a health condition. It could have been another treatment that was used alongside homeopathy that did the trick. It could have been a change of lifestyle. It could have simply been time: the human body fights for its health by itself. We all have powerful immune systems designed for keeping us alive and well.
Besides, what about all the people who didn't experience any help from homeopathy? We never see the homeopaths talk about them.

There is only one way homeopathic treatment could possibly help a human win over a disease or health condition: placebo. But it's an effect that applies to literally everything. You could eat a piece of candy, and believing in it enough, it could make you feel less ill. Funnily enough, that's basically what homeopathy is all about.


#Why it's unethical

Homeopathic doctors act like kind-hearted and helpful people, who embrace the idea of ""natural"" medicine as a way of healing for everyone. Some of them, I'm sure, truly believe their own lies. But this empathy is also a way to attract customers. Homeopathy is a big business, and a very greedy one.

These mixtures of water and alcohol are being sold to unsuspecting people as a risk-free, non-invasive cure to a plethora of different diseases/symptoms, usually as a liquid or in the form of small sugar pills. The problem with this is that even though they have no effect whatsoever, they are highly expensive, disguise themselves as real medicine and deceive people who often have chronic, painful, difficult, crippling diseases or conditions that they are desperately looking for relief for. The homeopathic industry not only lies to people and takes their money, it can even worsen public health by discouraging people from seeking help from proven, conventional medicine, guiding them towards homeopathy and other nonsensical alternative treatments instead. This is a true problem.


Lastly, I want to link you to a video about homeopathy made by a brilliant knowledge-spreading Youtube channel that some of you may have heard of: Kurzgesagt (In a nutshell). This video is what made me aware of the many flaws of homeopathy in the first place, and for that I'm endlessly thankful to the creators of it!

Almost daily, I hear ""My doctor sucks / my doctor doesn't listen / my doctor says there's nothing wrong with me / my doctor doesn't know what they're talking about"". 

I know what they mean is ""I feel like my doctor doesn't have time for me / I don't feel heard / I want an explanation for my symptoms that isn't related to mental health / etc."" These are systems issues, not problems with individal physicians.

It can be challenging for me to know what to say in these situations without sounding like I'm brushing them off or simply apologizing for a poorly designed system without offering any real solutions. I do always encourage them to discuss their concerns with their physician. I know I can suggest they ask for a longer appointment. But this doesn't address the other side of the issue, where I'm not sure their GP would always appreciate me giving this advice (longer appointments) because these also tend to be more 'difficult' patients.

medicine,A Case for MAiD,"Posted from @DavidJuurlink (https://twitter.com/davidjuurlink/status/1129811903776198659?s=21)

“I'd like to share some reflections on the death of a patient. I’ve thought about her a lot.

She gave me explicit consent to tweet the details of her case, about four hours before she died. Her hope was that someone might benefit from her experience.

/1
She came to hospital as octogenarians often do: with generalized weakness, falls, poor oral intake, fever, hypotension.

Her WBC was 17,000. Blood cultures grew E. coli.

Sepsis. Fixable enough.

/2
But she also complained of pain in her groin and thigh. It was new, progressive and debilitating.

Even moving around in her hospital bed was agonizing.

/3
A month earlier, she’d been found to have a large pseudoaneurysm arising from her external iliac artery.

(And yes, that’s a screw from a previous hip replacement traversing it.)

She underwent stenting and returned home.

/4

Because she was septic and in pain, we scanned her again. The new CT showed extensive gas within the pseudoaneurysm.

It was now infected, and that was a big problem.

/5

We continued antibiotics. She improved. We got her pain under reasonable control with hydromorphone and various other meds.

But then came the big question: “Now what?”

/6
She wanted no more surgery. Her mind was now sharp, and she was clear about that. 

But antibiotics alone weren’t going to cure the infection; they would only suppress it.

The best option, we suggested, would be antibiotics for the rest of her life.

/7
We discussed this option at length. She didn’t want it either. She explained why.
 
Pain was one reason. Meds helped a little, as long as she didn’t move around much. But our drug options were limited, and pain was going to be a persistent problem.

/8
Her even greater concern, looking forward, was quality of life.

Over the preceding months, she’d lost her mobility and independence. She wasn’t going to get them back and she knew it.

/9
She foresaw being confined to her apartment, in pain, struggling with her walker.

No more walks outside. No trips to the grocery store. No playing bridge with her friends, as she had done for years.

She wasn’t interested in living like that.

/10
We discussed palliative care: stopping antibiotics, increasing her pain meds, and keeping her comfortable while the infection took its course. Her family would keep vigil at her bedside for as long as it took.

She wasn’t interested in dying like that.

/11
She knew she was nearing the end of her life. What she wanted, she told us, was for it to end peacefully, with her mind still sharp, and her family and friends present. She wanted medical assistance in dying (MAiD).

/12
We held a family meeting. Relatives came from near and far.

They were unconditionally supportive. As it turned out, she’d discussed the prospect of MAiD, were it ever to become an option, several times in recent years.

So that became the plan.

/13
I saw her every day after that. Managed her pain. Listened to her stories. Learned about family members who’d died, and whose deaths had influenced her decision now.

Never once did she reconsider. I grew very fond of her, especially her wit and clear-eyed stoicism.

/14
After the requisite waiting period and medical assessments, the day had come.

I visited her at 7:30 that morning. She was alone but upbeat, eating Cheerios and toast from her tray.

(I still regret that this was her last meal. Wish I’d brought her a fresh bagel with lox.)

/15
A few hours later, her room was packed with family and friends. It was literally a party.

There was talking and laughing and cognac in Dixie cups. The mood was anything but funereal.

They gathered around her bed. I took a group photo. Everyone was smiling.

/16
I then watched as a colleague reviewed everything one last time, confirmed her wishes, explained what would happen, and answered everyone’s questions.

“Okay, I’m ready,” she said. Her composure was remarkable.

“Goodbye everyone. Thank you for everything. I love you all.”

/17
She received midazolam and dozed off peacefully, her children holding her hands and stroking her head.

Next came propofol, an anaesthetic.
Then rocuronium, a muscle relaxant.
Finally, potassium chloride, to stop her heart.

Five minutes after saying goodbye, she was dead.

/18
There were tears, of course. All around. But mostly the atmosphere in the room was one of serenity and gratitude, and a genuine sense of having done the right thing.

/19
I’m no MAiD expert, and I get that some people are opposed to it for various reasons. But I’ve been a doctor for 25 years, and I’ve seen enough deaths to know a good one from a bad one.

This was, without exaggeration, the best death I have ever witnessed.

/20
We all die eventually. This patient helped me realize that when my time comes, I'll be fortunate if MAiD is an option.

And I will always be thankful to her, her family, and a very skilled colleague for helping me appreciate just how good a “good death” can be.

/ end”

Like many here, I’ve seen peaceful and gruesome passings. But, having the ability and control to choose your time and place at the end of life and leave this world with grace should be a right of everyone. Also, the allergies are really bad today...

So patients just put their script in and then collect their medicines without ever having to leave their car? And if they have a huge pile of scripts, they just wait in the car park and a phamracy assistant/pharmacist brings the meds to them?

As you're probably aware, we like to run occasional AMAs related to the practice of medicine - anything from specific clinical conditions to broad policy. We're looking for members of the community interested in answering a few questions in a moderated, professional environment.

If you're interested, get in touch via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmedicine)! We are currently scheduling AMAs up to several months in advance to suit what we know are already very busy schedules. Our AMAs run with some pre-AMA advertising, and then a 24-hour submission period for questions which are then answered at the respondent's leisure on a date and time to suit.

Recent AMAs include:

* [Wellness Coordinators from Children's National](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/b6l71m/its_doctors_week_how_can_physicians_or_medical/)

* [The Aesclepius Snakevite Foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ajqhja/ama_we_are_the_asclepius_snakebite_foundation_asf/)

medicine,"I'm a Missouri resident and medical student, and I wrote a letter to Gov. Parson regarding HB126","""While portions of MO HB126 are encouraging, as a future physician I feel the need to tell you that the frank attack on the medical profession written into this bill, if not overturned, will cause an exodus of practicing and future physicians from Missouri.

""The provision: ""3. It shall be an affirmative defense for any person alleged to have violated the provisions of subsection 2 of this section that the person performed or induced an abortion because of a medical emergency. The defendant shall have the burden of persuasion that the defense is more probably true than not."" Places an impossible task on the physician who performs a medically necessary abortion, because there may be a physician, uninvolved in the case, that could be found by the state as ignorant of the details of the case or spiteful enough of his own profession who could be willing to testify against the decision made by the defendant - regardless of its validity. The state, by placing a physician performing a medically necessary abortion in the category of a felon until proven innocent, places a man or woman, whose holy and moral duty is to the good of their patient, in a legal vice – requiring them to not only make the difficult decision to end a life for the good of another, but also to determine (without legal representation in the moment) if the decision is legally provable as correct. Note the difference between medically correct and legally correct, here. A physician must, prior to performing a necessary and life saving abortion, collect and prepare a case absolving themselves of the decision - as this bill holds them guilty until proven innocent. Not only is this unconstitutional, but is also disrespectful to a profession far older and wiser than the state of Missouri, or even the United States itself.

""While I appreciate the provisions which encourage alternatives to abortions, and would like to encourage your office to continue exploring public policy in that regard, you do not have the authority to place anyone – let alone a physician in the reasonable pursuit of their holy responsibility to the safety of their patient – in the category of a felon, while also placing the burden of proof upon their shoulders.

""I will not practice medicine in Missouri if the aforementioned language is retained and passed into enforceable law, which would damage me greatly because I grew up, have family, and am being trained all within this great state. Missouri needs to protect and encourage physicians so we can continue to minister to and heal your constituents. Language such as this is inexcusable, and I believe the medical community deserves it to be overturned, and an apology.""  


I don't agree with a lot of this bill, but I wanted to focus on this terrible provision. I'm hoping Missouri practicing physicians, other medical professionals, and medical-field students will all join me in making noise about this. We all deserve a presumption of innocence. We haven't devoted our lives to healing others to be rendered a criminal in the pursuit of the good of our patients. If you are willing to help out and write a letter, you can go to this link:

The first part has arrived this morning from Dr. Linda Mason, President of the ASA via the organization's Monday Morning Outreach:

""I want to thank those of you who alerted us to a document recently released by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) called “CRNAs: We are the Answer.”

I was disappointed to read this malicious statement. However, there is little that’s new here. This is the same recycled, reformatted misinformation the organization has spread for years. We saw it during our campaign to preserve high-quality care in the VA. We saw it in New York last year. We have seen it this year in the seven states where the AANA and its state societies attempted to dismantle existing patient safety standards that ensured patient access to physician-led, team-based models of anesthesia. It didn’t persuade anyone at the VA or in New York or in states like Oklahoma or Arkansas. In each case, physician-delivered and physician-led care was preserved. I commend our members in those states who worked so hard for their patients.

In debate after debate, ASA has successfully responded to the misinformation the AANA foists upon state and federal policymakers. We point out that “nurse anesthesiologist” is a shameless term created to confuse patients. We explain the vast difference in education, skills and training between our medical specialty and nurse anesthetists. We present the fact that the data cited by the AANA to suggest equivalency in care is from brazen, self-funded advocacy studies paid for by the AANA itself. We give policymakers the independent studies that show superior outcomes with the involvement of anesthesiologists. And we are now highlighting that team-based anesthesia is a World Health Organization standard. The AANA and its state societies throw a lot of contempt at our medical specialty. But the good news is that with professionalism and facts, we are winning. And when we win, our patients win.

This AANA document is little more than vitriol. It is about appropriating the name of our medical specialty, disrupting successful team-based models, and ridiculous accusations of “fraud,” “overcompensation” and “barriers.” For ASA and our members, it is all about our patients and what is best for them.

The AANA document simply does not reflect reality. Throughout the country, our members continue to work successfully with nurse anesthetists in a team-based model that frequently also includes anesthesiologist assistants. We are grateful to work with all members of the care team. ASA is committed to preserving and strengthening physician-delivered and physician-led team-based models because that is what is best for our patients. We won’t be distracted from this mission, and I ask that you continue to work with me to preserve our victories and build upon them.

I also want to note that it appears this document is at the center of a larger campaign that the AANA will be unveiling soon. We will have a more detailed response to share with you here and in other member communications as events unfold.

You can read the AANA’s motivation for the document on their website.""

So far, this is a specialty-wide communication, and no ""official statement"" has been made.

pharmacy,PSA: Get your CV/Resume in order (reads like a rant),"I recently was in the position to review about 75+ resumes/CVs for a pharmacist position reporting directly to me in a clinical role. Here is my *state of the union* on how pharmacists of all experience levels are performing on their paper submissions.  


Overall impression: lack luster  


**The good:**  
- I didn't find a single typo. Great work here everyone!  
- The good ones are really good. They highlight what makes them special, leave out the obvious (i.e. I know you counsel patients if you work at a retail pharmacy), and didn't try to stuff their CV with vocabulary fluff. If you didn't know already, we can tell you don't talk like that.  
- Generally, font was not too small. Readability is actually super important. Everyone should assume that the reviewer will be looking at your resume electronically rather than in paper format in my opinion.   


**The bad (get ready to cringe, because these are all real):**  
- Do not submit your CV by taking multiple screen shots of your CV on your phone and uploading the photos. If you are going to try this, at least make sure that none of your screen shots has a pop-up box covering portions of your CV.   
- If you are a licensed pharmacist with at least 1 year of experience under your belt, don't bother with listing your rotations.   
- Always explain a gap in employment. I had one resume where the work experience ended in 2012. No supplemental information provided. No other experience was listed anywhere else. No cover letter either. What do you expect me to do with that?  
- At least try to tailor your prior experience to something relevant to the job. We had a lot of management oriented folks and candidates with lots of experience, but none of it was clinical in nature. You're applying for a clinically oriented position, you should probably highlight some clinical work. If you just want your identity known to the company, you may want to preface that in your cover letter. With the market as competitive as it is now, I don't know any of my colleagues that hire pharmacists that dig back in the archive. Usually, star candidates are readily available.  
- Quite a few 3+ page CVs for pharmacists who have only worked standard retail jobs. Don't overstate your work. It only detracts from the aspects of your work that make you a stand out candidate. Forget dispensing and regulatory requirements. Talk about awards, metrics (as much as we hate them), process improvement, unique programs, community outreach, etc.  
- I don't need an extra 2 pages highlighting all of your residency rotations. It's a educational supplement. It should be a single entry, just like your university/college information. If you published, list is in your publications section. If you did something amazing, write about it in a cover letter.  


**Things I think either people don't mind seeing or over react negatively to (I don't mind seeing them):**  
- hobbies  
- interests  
- goals  
- short bio  


In today's job market, it's important to stand out, in good ways. Things I would always try to do if possible, not specific to CVs/resumes but for being ready for a job change: write a cover letter, network like your life depended on it, continue to develop as if you're going to change jobs even if you never plan on leaving, keep your LinkedIn up to date, ask your colleagues to review your CV. If you feel ashamed to show your friends your CV/resume, guess what, the hiring manager will know it.  


Just needed to get this off my chest. What are some tips y'all have for CVs/resumes? What in your experience just has more to do with the ego of the hiring manager than anything else?",64,148,2019-05-27,PHARMA,0.05221431702375412,0.9198909401893616,0.02789473347365856

pharmacy,"From ""its a choice to be a junkie"" to MAT pharmacist","Im proud to be a pharmacist. I feel its a great career, good pay, gets to help people, but no blood and guts that other medical fields see. 

I always describe pharmacists as smart enough to be doctors but wanted more fun than 8 years of college + endless years of residency. Were the cool kids on the block that somehow has all the answers but arent stuck up and pretentious. 

HOWEVER Ive got to say, the attitude that some of you give towards those with addiction is disgusting and makes me embarassed. Were professionals. We quite literally KNOW it is a chronic psychological and physiological disease, that certain people, due to genetics or upbringing, or something else are more prone to suffering from it than others. Yet, Ive recently seen multiple posters in this subreddit treat them as scum of the earth. 

You are no better than the homophobic health care professionals in the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic who said it was brought on themselves. You think the world should bend to you. That your word is absolute. You act as if you are infallible. How dare someone not respect that. Some of us are as egotistical as the worst doctors out there.

Let me give you my experience in pharmacy before you go on to say that im living in some corperate ""bubble"". I used to be just like you.

I grew up in rural America where the ""war on drugs"" was very much alive (i was brainwashed).My very first day of working for the 3letter, I was a P2, working the last shift of the night. 2 men come in looking for the standard 32g 1/2"" 1cc needles. We were out and i told them as much. The response I got was ""oh uh huh sure. I bet youd jave them if wes was white."" I was flabbergasted and stared at them as they walked away. The pharmacists station was right behind me and he burst out laughing. I stayed with that chain for 5 years and got more or less the same hostile treatment from this population. 

And over the years I became bitter. I was overworked, understaffed, under-paid and the people who made my day worse were always the early fillers and ""what-do-you-mean-i-have-no-refills""-on-friday-at-6pm people. 

I looked down on the people who OD'd in the bathroom and parking lot. I was proud how toe-to-toe i  could go without backing down.... i literally thought i was better than them and it felt good to deny them. What the fuck was wrong with me? Answer: the company. I was so run ragged, i let it brig me down and i looked for any situation where i could have control during my work day. 

Guess what- those with addiction go to independants too! But they dont have the issues we do. Why? Because they arent run but coorperate overlords. So the problem isnt the ""junkies,"" its that you dont have time to deal with them. They can have the necessicary conversations and do so without being rushed or feeling like the rest of thier day is going to be shit for it. 

I left true retail 2 and a half years ago. I work part time in inpatient and full time as a MTM pharmacist for MAT patients at one of the largest residential addiction treatment programs in the northeast. I expected to hate it, to be frustrated constantly and to quit after a few months. Turns out, i love it. Part of the program being developed is a series of surveys on healthcare they recieve prior to intake- do they feel thier doctors, nurses, pharmacists have met them with respect? Do they expect to have to be abrasive to get what they want due to that lack of respect? 

You should see the difference in attitude when they realize im not going to fight them, that Im here for them, and that basic resepect should be expected from healthcare professionals. 

Im not here to pull the im-holier-than-thou card. Until I got my current job, i knew, factually, that addiction was a disease, but i didnt truly believe it. So i get it. I really do. For those that arent on your high horse, thank you. Its hard. I know. But for those that have rolled your eyes at this post, I urge you to really take a hard look at why you hate serving thos woth substance use disorders. Is it because you dont have the time? Thats coorperates fault for not giving you time, not the patients'. Why do you look down on the patient who stopped picking up syringes and now gets suboxone filled every tuesday morning like clockwork? Is it because you think its just as ""dirty"" as heroin use? Or because you lost something you used as a frustration outlet? 

Take a hard look at why you became, and still are, a pharmacist. If you have no compassion for those who did something stupid once or even a handful of times and got hooked, you should probably re-evaluate your career path. Maybe community isnt right for you if you cant or wont help the whole community. 

Id be happy to discuss valid viewpoints but will not even validate the ideas of ""just let them stay dead when they OD next time"" type responses. You should be ashamed of yourself.

Please tell me I'm not reading this correctly (apologies for not fully understanding the jargon of medical certification yet). If I wanted to practice general pediatrics inpatient in the future, would I need to pursue additional certification? Or can a board certified general pediatrician still work inpatient? 

If this is the future, do you see this being a significant strain on the available workforce? I know many pediatric subspecialties go underfilled, and some research suggests that many fellowships are financially net negative decisions (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/2/254)
