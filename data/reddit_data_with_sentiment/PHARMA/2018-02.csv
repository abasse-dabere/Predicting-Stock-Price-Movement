medicine,ETCO2 and Sepsis,"Hoping someone can help me get my head around something. 

Is ETCO2 low in Sepsis due to low perfussion resulting in lower levels of co2 being produced by aerobic metabolism and this lower co2 being removed by the lungs

Or is it due to acidosis from anaerobic metabolism resulting in more production of co2 via buffering of H+, corresponding increaded RR and thus lower ETCO2

Or is it a combination on the 2.

&gt; Spring 2018: Physicians will be able to access UpToDate directly through the exam platform for part of the Internal Medicine and Nephrology traditional MOC exams, while the other part will be closed book. This allows ABIM to evaluate the performance of questions to ensure a fair testing experience while transitioning from closed-book exams to exams that allow access to an external resource within the assessment.

&gt; All other spring 2018 traditional MOC exams will be entirely closed book.

&gt; Fall 2018: Physicians will be able to access UpToDate within the assessment for the entire Internal Medicine and Nephrology traditional MOC exams. All other traditional MOC exams administered in fall 2018 will feature access to UpToDate for part of the exam.

medicine,Hospitalists-- are you happy??,"Dear Meddit,

Third year med student here who literally likes almost every specialty. However, I could see myself best as an internist-- specifically, hospital medicine as I prefer inpatient. Maybe GI or ID, but for now, focused on if I don't ever get that special fellowship I might decide I want in the future.

My question-- I hear there is a lot of burnout- that ""hospitalists don't stay hospitalists for long."" Is this true? 7 on 7 off schedule for 250K a year seems pretty nice. I don't like that some institutions have hospitalists doing a bunch of baby sitting for procedure based specialties like Ortho, but I figure this may vary location to location.

Are you happy as a hospitalist? How long have you been doing so? Any advice? I'm competitive enough for just about any specialty, and I'm also considering EM and derm (but derm may not be my preferred area of interests...). I have to schedule fourth year courses by the end of next week, so really trying to move fast on this decision.

medicine,Job Dilemma. Need Advice.,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am trying to keep this as anonymous as possible and I apologize if this post is too cryptic. 

I started my first first job out of fellowship 6 months ago at a very good private practice (single specialty, about 20 physicians). During the interview we discussed what my role in the group would be and it seemed like a good fit. I was hired to mostly cover A but was also promised that I would get a significant amount of time to cover B which is something that I find really enjoyable.

Fast forward 6 months and due to some extenuating circumstances we find our group short-staffed in the C service and so I've been scheduled on that service about 80% of the time for the last 3 months. I also have had 0 time to cover B.

I have casually spoken to the president of the group 2 times about this already and basically get the response of ""we're short-staffed right now and really appreciate you covering C and the ultimate plan is for you to spend all of your time at A and B."" We last discussed this 3 weeks ago and the schedule for April just came out and I'm covering C 100% of the time. Of note, they could rotate me through A and B if they shifted some things around.
 
The job market is really good for my field and if I had been told that I would be covering C even half of the time I would not have taken this job.  I understand that the group has needs and it's important to be a ""team player"" but at this point it seems like they don't care at all about trying to keep me happy or honor what we discussed during the interviews.

I don't know how to best approach the situation. Whether I should bring it up again now that the April schedule is out (to try and make sure that this doesn't happen again for May) or suck it up and cover C for a few more months before raising the issue again. Would it look bad if when I do broach the issue I actually have the numbers of how much time I've spent on each service over the last 6 months or would that be seen as a little much?

I am committed to sticking around for 12 months but if the situation doesn't change I will start looking for jobs then. I feel like I should not broadcast this but on the other hand if they knew this was the case they might be compelled to work with me to keep me in the group. I think that they would very much like to be stay and become a partner as I am a hard worker, well-trained, and am a ""team player"". 

Thanks for the advice.

TL:DR Job is not as discussed in the interview. Have brought it up 2 times (as recently as 3 weeks ago). Not sure how to proceed at this point. 

FOLLOW UP: Thank you all for your responses! What are your thoughts on letting them know that if the situation hasn't started improving by August I am going to start looking for jobs that better align with my interests (the job I thought I was going to have)?

medicine,Can someone give me a relatively-unbiased rundown of the Canadian health system vs. the US health system?,"I've been trying to do research on this more independently, but it's really difficult to find a seemingly-objective piece on it. It's either the Canadian healthcare system is the best and wait times are short, outcomes are fantastic, and everyone is happy.... or it's a piece talking about how people die waiting for care, the government is turning people down left and right for therapies, and all of the affluent citizens are coming to the US for proper care.

What is the reality of it? I am immensely frustrated with the US insurance-based system we have, but I also feel like I have received excellent care throughout my life despite the negatives of it. What are the true pros and cons of a system like Canada has in place?

pharmacy,Pharmacist disclosed she doesn't think mental illnesses require medication at all,"I'm a 6th year intern and work in one of the big chain pharmacies. My pharmacist (aged 28) frequently avoids filling Narcs (Addy etc) by lying to patients telling them we don't have the medication in stock and telling them to come back again next week to check without even glancing at their profile or PMP.

A technician noticed her constant lying and asked why she wouldn't fill. She started off by saying *""The pharmacist in charge says that we should only fill Narcs for existing patients""* {not true, I've seen the PIC fill new narcs before};
I pointed out that I understood why they'd want to keep the number of narc patients small but that it really sucks for these patients basically having no way of getting their medication. ( In NY we can't transfer out Narcs)
She then proceeded to say *""personally I don't think that class of medications should exist at all. Anti-depressants too.""*

Shocked, I told her as a healthcare professional she shouldn't say that. She continued, *""I just think depression is something you can get over by changing your mindset. You should get over them in other ways besides medication.""*

As someone who has suffered from chronic depression/anxiety x 10 years, as someone who has never gotten help until recently because of constantly being told depression wasn't real, as someone who has several attempts of suicide I popped ; *""I've been chronically depressed for over 10 years please don't say that because if I could just get over it I would have by now""*. My voice was cracking and I was trying to not cry in front of everyone.

Over the rest of the shift she attempted to reconcile and explain she only understood mental illness from her MIL *""I feel like she'd get better if she just went out and did things""*... and all I could respond to that was that as a health care provers she sounded very ignorant. 

A few hours later it was just me and her and she again tried to probe about my depression and why I had it, did I tell my parents? etc etc. I felt so un-comfortable I cried my way home that night. I should have told her to look at her notes from pharmacy school. She may have thought it was okay to keep probing because we talk about our personal lives like boys and her husband etc etc. But this wasn't ok. **It felt like she was trying to see how bad depression could be for it to validate needing medication**.

I'm just really upset and I don't feel okay going back to work. I tried really hard to keep my illness private, I fill my meds at a local pharmacy but now I just feel exposed and uncomfortable knowing this is how a health professional that I'm suppose to learn from thinks. My friends are suggesting I report her but I'm unsure of what to do.

medicine,Question for anesthesiologists or others that interact with CRNAs on a regular basis...,"Do you notice a difference in the ability of CRNAs that come with significant ICU experience versus those with the bare minimum to get admitted to their programs? I take issue with advanced practice nursing education in general - mostly the joke that most NP programs are compared to their PA counterpart, but CRNA as well. I started nursing 3.5 years ago on the floor, and started with 4 RNs from the unit I transferred to ~1.5 years ago. By the time I started on this unit, 3 of the 4 were preparing to leave for CRNA school, which means they were likely accepted with a little over a year experience as an RN, 20ish weeks of which were orientation. Not to mention the 4 or 5 others that came from the floor, worked a year to get experience and left for school. From my limited interaction working with them, they were totally competent RNs, but still, that's crazy to me. For the record, these are large university-based CRNA programs, so we're not talking about some for-profit diploma mill.

I understand that the role of a critical care RN is not the same as providing anesthesia in an OR setting, and the didactic and clinical portions of CRNA education are much more robust than their NP counterparts (though still paling in comparison to med school + residency). That being said, I have to imagine that someone with years of experience can bring more to the table as a CRNA versus someone who has been a nurse less time than they were in college and can barely put in a peripheral IV (heard that from someone else about a significant other in CRNA school). 

I don't know, I'm just a bit disillusioned about the whole thing, but maybe (probably?) I'm wrong, so I figured it was worth seeing what actual experiences you may have had.

medicine,Bullying in the profession,"Hello, 

So I am not a doctor, I am a bedside nurse. I have worked in multiple teaching hospitals and have always worked with residents and students and always loved learning from the medical team and working with them. 

Nursing can be known for eating their young . I don't stand for it.  I'll be happy to tell someone they're being inappropriate. 

I always assumed there was a level of respect between residents and attending and medical students.  I have a best friend who is a neurologist - we met in my home state -and he made med school seem really okay - busy and stressful but nothing I wouldn't expect. 

I went on a date recently in another state and this guy is telling me horror stories . That a doctor was drilling him on aneurysms. Asking him repeated questions, and then yelling if he didn't know. He told me a classmate who didn't prep appropriately for one day and then the attending berated her and failed her for the rotation.  He told me of how some students have been thrown out of the OR for not knowing the precise word for all the equipment they'd be using .

I've never seen this on the unit or near me, thankfully. I don't think I would be able to keep quiet.  

Is this normal? Is this kind of hazing and bullying just a part of the profession?

It honestly breaks my heart . Luckily in nursing school I was blessed with understanding preceptors and I have worked with amazing people who know I can't know everything and are happy to teach me.

Is there anything I can do ?  Or should do? Does anyone have similiar experiences  ?

Edit: I think I've maybe failed to communicate.  I am okay with drilling questions . Im okay with high standards.  I'm not okay with verbal abuse and berating and humiliating.  I'm against power trips. I'm against professionals acting in an unprofessional manner even to their students.  I understand the difference between a bit cold and stern and actually humiliating and verbal abusing someone.",82,64,2018-02-11,PHARMA,0.07072434574365616,0.8961441516876221,0.03313155844807625

medicine,Is it possible to have joy in contemporary medicine?,"I was reflecting on this questions with some of my colleagues today. As internal medicine residents, we were unanimous in our feeling that our current life in medicine is absolute drudgery. It is essentially a joyless enterprise punctuated by the occasional rewarding patient encounter or interesting case. Crushing student debt, sunk cost bias, and the promise for a better future are what keep us going.
We identified some factors that contribute to the lack of joy in our practice and I would be curious what my Meddit colleagues further along in training or in practice would add:

1. Patient Compliance: I work in an inner-city, public hospital with a predominantly Medicaid and indigent population. I chose to do residency here because I wanted to serve vulnerable people and maximize my impact. However, the egregious lack of compliance with therapy and lifestyle interventions is absolutely soul-crushing. Despite being fully cognizant of the biopsychosocial realities of my patients' lives and their social determinants of health, I can't help but think I would prefer to work with a patient population with higher health literacy and higher financial resources in the future. 

2. Work-life balance: I have concluded that it is impossible to maintain sustained wellness when you are working 70-80 hours a week. No amount of appreciation lunches, chief residents check ins, or therapy dog sessions will change that fact. I want to not be tired all the time. I want a life outside of medicine. I accept that this is a part of our training and I knew what I was getting into, but I have concluded that burnout is an inevitable part of our training process. I will try to control this in the future by having reasonable salary expectations (to ensure more controlled hours), maintaining hobbies, and having friends outside of the medical bubble.

3. Patient Gratitude: When you are working so many hours at what amounts to minimum wage, intrinsic rewards are essential. I love that I get to be a lifelong learner. Medicine is so cool and interesting. However, it's the human side that makes it feel worth it. I rarely feel that my patients are grateful for the care I provide. I understand it. I am just one of dozens of tired appearing doctors that parade through their room. I have only a few minutes to spend with them and care more about my agenda and list of things that I need to check off then what their concerns are. To me, patient gratitude comes from having a sustained relationship with their provider, trust, time to form a meaningful relationship, and notable improvement. Those are the exceptions not the rule in my current practice. 

4. Impact of Interventions. Many of my patients do get better but mostly in a transitory way. If they have a COPD exacerbation, I can make them breath better for a while; if they are fluid overloaded, I can diurese them. However, the amount of medical futility I see equals or exceeds the amount of improvement. Ultimately, it is the compliance and sustained provider-patient relationships described above that will improve this. I feel bad to say it but I would also prefer to work with patients that are a little less sick.

5. Limiting Administrative Work. This has been spoken about ad nausem but bears repeating. The human connections are what bring us to this field and separate us from other professions. It is what keeps pre-medical and medical students motivated. It is insane to me how much of our day to day practice is staring at a computer screen. There is this perverse inversion of priorities where we ""don't let patient care interfere with our documentation"". Some of this is systemic and inevitable but I think having a more intuitive, streamlined EMR and more collaborative, less pugnacious administrators would help somewhat.

So is possible to have joy in contemporary medicine? I think so, but it requires mindfulness and trade-offs. The above would go along way to realign my personal expectations with reality.

Would love to hear your thoughts and comments.",102,95,2018-02-14,PHARMA,0.049668148159980774,0.9204677939414978,0.029864082112908363

Many of my patients are in assisted-living. I get multiple faxes every day letting me know that a patient has fallen and what their vital signs are. There is a physician response area where they want me to write in what I suggest and sign the sheet. I refuse to do this. I have written on it many times if you feel the patient needs the assistance of a physician please have them make an appointment.

I also get, from one particular assisted living facility, faxes from the medical director (who apparently is a medical doctor), requesting that I send in certain orders. Four instance, I got a fax today telling me that the patient had symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The fax requested that I send an order for a culture and sensitivity as well as a urinalysis. I wrote on the sheet “all of my patients need appointments with me for any medical orders.” It seems to me like the medical director is trying to shift liability upon me.

medicine,Needing to vent about an interaction on the MICU,"So this happened a few nights ago but it has been really bugging me. I was on night shift for the MICU and we had a patient with a history of a tracheostomy , now breathing through a stoma (he had a larytube). So this patient had a poor prognosis from his illness and he is declining quick, to the point that palliative medicine was involved (and hes in the ICU), however the patient wanted to remain full code following discussions during the day shift while he was still oriented. His mentation began to worsen and he was not really responsive. ABG was showing  metabolic and respiratory acidosis. I was considering hooking him up to the ventilator to help with the CO2, but since he didn't have a cuffed trach, I tried to get either ENT or Anesthesia to help. After some back and forth with them about it and a repeat ABG that showed the CO2 improving (there was still metabolic acidosis but he was now on bicarb), I decided to put placement of a cuff on hold for now as mechanical ventilation didn't seem to be warranted at the moment (I also discussed it with the fellow). All of this was communicated with the patient's RN and we were all on the same page.

So shift change comes around and the day RN comes on and calls me literally 5 minutes after he finishes report with the night RN and asks me about the plan. I explain to them that I would like a repeat ABG soon to make sure the hypercapnia wasn't going back in the wrong direction. This is when the RN's tone changes and they begin to speak very aggressively. They begin asking me about why ENT had not come by yet to place the cuff and why I had not placed a formal consult. I explain to him that I didn't think it was indicated at this time and that I had already spoken to them. He then demands that I place the consult for ENT and he says that *he* (yes, the nurse wants to call my consult in for me) will call them as it's unacceptable that they haven't done it yet. Again, I explain to him that the patient's CO2 is not at a point that MV is warranted. He says that since the patient is full code and his mentation is worsened that he must ""advocate"" for the patient. He also accuses me of just ""treating numbers"" on the ABG. I again explain to him that his mentation changes are unlikely to be changed from ventilating him and there is no emergency at this time as the patient is ventilating fine on his own. He then asks for my attending's name, so at this point I am starting to get extremely irritated but I want to remain professional so I just tell him that my fellow is here and I will discuss with him the plan (which wasn't a lie) and this seems to defuse the conversation. I managed to make it through the whole phone call without raising my voice or making it obvious I was irritated, but lets just say I let out some expletives after I hung the phone up.

Now, my problem is not that a nurse was questioning my decisions. In fact, I even asked him what his concerns specifically were and I was happy to discuss it. What I did have an enormous problem with was this person saying they are the advocate for the patient, insinuating that I was not doing what was in the patient's interest, i.e., *I didn't care*. I gave this person a logical, thought out explanation for why I was doing what I was doing yet they didn't seem to understand and were fixated on a singular issue. I tried to make it even simpler by saying that if this patient didn't have a stoma, I wouldn't have intubated them either. And again, this nurse had just literally started their shift and I was there all night. The night nurse even seemed to be onboard with the plan.

medicine,What are your favorite medical blunders?,"I am consistently amused at how wrong medicine has been over the years. And not only how wrong we are, but how confident we are in our wrong-ness. Our hubris knows no bounds. 

My examples:

1. Tobacco smoke enemas of the 1700's. This is so ridiculous that it's almost hard to believe. Medical professionals of the time thought that blowing tobacco smoke into the rectum could resuscitate drowning victims.  They actually lined The River Thames in England with tobacco enema kits in the same way we line society with AEDs today. 

2. A more modern example - blood sugar control in the ICU. I vividly remember rotating through the surgical ICU as a medical student. It was terrifying. Malignant attendings and overworked, miserable residents gave me a sad glimpse into my immediate future. One memory that is burned into my brain is the daily tongue lashing the residents received because of the 'poor glucose control' of their patients. 

""Glucose needs to be below 110!!!""
""Increased mortality!!!""
""This is evidence based!!!""
(Van den Berghe Neurology 2005;64(8):1348)

Fast forward two years later. I, a young resident in the SICU, am fully prepared to be aggressive with my insulin. Only to find out....""oh yeah, we don't do that any more"".

""You mean... all that yelling during rounds two years ago was for nothing?""
""....pretty much""
(NICE SUGAR NEJM 360: 1283, 2009)

I often wonder what practices I currently have that will look absolutely incompetent 5, 10, or 100 years from now.

medicine,Anyone regret choosing family over career?,"I'm an M2 trying to figure out what specialty to go into (we submit electives in a month or two), and I'm struggling to decide between surgery and a more lifestyle friendly/ geographically flexible specialty. 

I've spent a few months shadowing in the OR and I've really enjoyed it. I like the environment, I joking around with the attendings and staff, I like the cool tech and the anatomy. I also enjoy the idea of working with my hands, of mastering a skillset and of providing more definitive treatments. People have told me that I should really love surgery to go into it, but how am I supposed to know I love it if I won't be operating until deeper into residency?

I've always been a family oriented person and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer recently. The prognosis is fairly good, but this was still a wake up call as it got me thinking about my parents' mortality. Because of how competitive residency is, there's a good chance I'll have to move fairly far away. I know residency is only 5 years of my life (with a fellowship or two likely to follow due to job market in my country), but if you think about it, that could constitute a good part of the time I have left with my family. Complicating things is that my girlfriend of five years is geographically immobile, so if I do end up moving away that relationship may not work out. I know things get better as an attending, but I'm still not sure if the schedule would allow me to spend as much time with my loved ones as I would want. 

On the other hand there are specialties that are less competitive that have less intense residencies and a better lifestyle as attendings. I still find the work interesting, but it isn't as much fun, or as exciting as surgery is to me.

medicine,"I need to get this off my chest, I feel like a terrible doctor","I am expecting damning replies because I did a terrible thing. I am posting this because I want to get it off my chest.

At 8pm, just outside my house, a person fell off their bike. A bystander knocked on the door, somehow knew that doctors live at my address and asked my housemate to ask me to see the person.

I was lying in bed, dozing off, having just eaten my dinner. The situation didn't sound grave (?sp) from my housemate's account and he asked me if he should tell them to call the ambulance. I agreed and told him to do that. 

He then told the person at our door that I (the doctor) told them to call the ambulance.

I have been a doctor for 18 months (25yo), so I am pretty junior (UK). At this moment, I felt a bit under pressure and panicked. I am currently working in a radiology rotation so there are no emergencies. I haven't had my emergency thinking hat on for a while. What if I have forgotten how to assess an acutely ill patient? What if I do something wrong? So I just thought it was best to get the paramedics along.

Almost immediately after the door closed, I asked my housemate if we knew if the person had hit his head or was even alive? He said he didn't know. So it was at that point that I did what I should've done to begin with - I left and tried my best to attend to the person.

At the moment, I'm very much filled with guilt. I feel so terrible that I didn't go out to see the person. What kind of doctor does that? Even if there is no good samaritan law, it's a basic human instinct to help someone else. 

I just really need to get this off my chest because it's making me feel really hateful towards myself.",52,77,2018-02-22,PHARMA,0.20248770713806152,0.7731828093528748,0.024329490959644318

I have browsed this reddit for awhile and generally keep to the comment section; however, today I have decided I would like to actually contribute to this sub more than just a drive-by comment. I found that I enjoy cases, and enjoy education; two things I find this sub to be frequently lacking. I specialize in emergency medicine, and if I had a subspecialty it would be in evaluating the emergent ECG. Being a simple guy who likes to stick to what he knows, I have decided to sporadically post interesting ECG cases I come across. As Ghandi said, ""Be the change you wish to see in your subreddit"". Please give me feedback, and let me know if this is something you all want me to continue.

CASE #1

You're working a very busy shift in your ER when you are asked by your Comm Tech to review an ECG that EMS is requesting cath lab activation for. They give a brief hx that the patient is a 40+ year old man with a hx of HTN who was found unresponsive at home. They state he was found to be hypotensive and demonstrating agonal respirations, so was intubated in the field and started on a dopamine drip. They request cath lab activation. ECG is linked below. What do you see? What do you do?

I’m pretty informal, so ask what you’d like and I’ll give it to you (check comments prior to asking, start historically then exam then diagnostics if able).

31yo male with history of mild asthma and active tobacco use presented from OSH with 10d of worsening cough, fever, malaise, sob. Over the past 36hrs he developed pleurisy which prompted him to seek medical attention. He has never had these symptoms before, has no other known medical conditions, and does not take any medications. His CXR showed faint, hazy, nodular opacities throughout both lung fields.

UPDATE:

Update, as I think u/brugada was on it.
Young guy worked housing construction, exposed to soil, dust. Has a healthy dog. No ther known exposures.

His serum blastomyces antigen was strongly positive and urine histo ag was weakly positive. I learned that the antigens cross react with the assays so simply based on these it is difficult to tease out which is which. He improved on ctx/azithro over his stay, which argues for acute histoplasmosis as this is a self limiting disease and usually improves on its own. He underwent CT head to screen for CNS disease if this were blasto, and this was normal. Histo and Blasto Igg and Igm are pending and ID plans to get serology ina  few months to hopefully confirm a diagnosis. He was started and sent home on po itraconazole. Luckily he was able to avoid bronch with BAL and likely EBUS if none of his serologies had returned positive.

Popped into a grocery store looking for one of those prune squeezy pouches or something, can’t find prunes anywhere (or even prune/apple, prune/berry). So I got some other fruit pouches, then ran in the pharmacy next door out of curiosity. When I asked the pharmacist, she had literally never heard of prune puree. She suggested I buy a blender and make it myself. I asked if she had glycerin suppositories and she just stared at me. Then she asked how old the baby was (he’s also a smidge small for his age), and proceeded to hand me what looked like pediatric ex lax. It just said “chocolate laxatives for kids.” Needless to say, I declined that one. Baby was fine after a day or two of pears but it was weird. I like chatting with pharmacists in other countries to hear what’s the same and different, but this little old lady was just not clicking.

medicine,"Dear Meddit, I am thinking of moving to another city for my career but my girlfriend is opposed to it- Really want some advice","Sorry if this comes off a bit like a /r/relationship post, but I wanted to get advice from other doctors who have been in similar positions as myself.

  I (26M) am currently finishing FY2 junior training in the UK, and I have applied for core medical training (CMT) (2 years long) with the intention of becoming an academic neurologist. Not sure if this is akin to the US system, but during 2 years of CMT, we rotate every 4-6 month to a different medical specialty so we get a diverse experience.

  Here's the thing, I reasoned that I needed to find a job that includes a neurology rotation if I were to specialise in it after CMT. where I am currently living in does not have a great deal of jobs with a neurology rotation ( I am living with my girlfriend right now), I will apply to them, but I expect they will be highly competitive because of their sparsity. This was when I realised, there is an abundance of neurology hospitals in London- every bloody hospital has a neurology department!! I can't help but thinking and wanting to work there, the heart of the UK and the centre of neurology, there will be plenty of research I could participate in as well, and the london universities and research facilities are one of the best in the world. I mean, who wouldn't be excited right?

  Anyways, heres the problem- my girlfriend is against moving to London at all costs, other places she may consider. This is the one place that she is 100% against, due to costs of living and her pre-conceived idea that she would not get along with any southeners. My gf is also a non-medic and she isn't career driven and she said that moving away from your partner for a career is an idea that is completely foreign to her. She is also v against LDR as she doesn't do well when we don't see each other regularly. Not only this, but she said if I were to move, she would not want to be with someone who does not prioritise their relationship above everything else. We have been together for 1.5 years and it is going well, we do get on well generally, and I know there is more than one way to get into the specialty that you want. 

  Here's the question- 1. how important do you think it is that I find a job that has a neurology rotation in it? Should I just stay and work in a standard CMT programme , maybe with stroke rotation?
  2. what the hell should I do? I don't want to be the kind of person that puts career over a person, but at the same time, this is my ambition and I really do want to end up as a neurologist",53,49,2018-02-26,PHARMA,0.058941274881362915,0.913046658039093,0.028012093156576157

pharmacy,Need some advice about mistreatment at three letter,"I’m probably going to be putting in my two weeks notice at three letter today. But, I’d like some advice if possible regarding further action because my only reasoning for leaving is due to direct actions of my PIC. I’m formatting an email to the DM, but if she doesn’t take action, I need to know where to go next. I’m the lead technician, and have been there for 3 years, if that makes a difference. Here are the highlights—PIC:

-has us do/expects us to do work off the clock (I’ve already reported this to the ethics line about a month ago, no changes)

-takes our modules for us, when I ask to take my own, he says he’ll print out the pages for me to read at home.

-has made fun of me repeatedly in front of coworkers, the staff pharmacist, and within earshot of customers saying I have “neurological issues” (I have depression and GAD and get my scripts filled at work, so he knows what medications I’m on) what he doesn’t know is that most of it stems from a brutal suicide I witnessed as a teenager. Regardless, HIPAA violation? Certainly code of conduct violation.

-I confronted him about working off the clock (I refused to do it) and when he didn’t change his requests, I spoke with the store manager regarding it (because the DM position was in transition) She spoke with him and I promptly got a phone call at home with him saying I betrayed him. Phone call ended with me in tears.

-he is now scheduling me under 30 hours per week for the next three weeks. At this rate, I’ll lose insurance on myself and my children. This is clearly retaliation. 

I’ve both called and now am writing the DM an email. I have two job offers lined up and when I spoke with the DM (short convo, was only able to tell her some of the above), she mentioned maybe transferring me. I’m open to that as a possibility, but I feel bad for my coworkers I’m leaving behind and the PIC should be punished for these behaviors.

Over my time at the bedside and during clinical rotations with preceptors I have come upon a trend I'm trying to understand. Frequently I have seen physicians, NPs and PAs document negative ROS complaints without actually asking the patient, and negative physical exam findings that were clearly not assessed.

The obvious answer I have gotten my entire time in healthcare is to never document something I did not do, and I have stayed true to that so far. Yet this practice seems common. I have witnessed multiple people document normal TMs, benign abdomens, and nontender lymph nodes without touching the patient. I have seen many variations of, ""denies cough, fever, chills, SOB, CP, palpitations"" without asking the patient any of those questions. I am not trying to act holier than thou or question the ways of others, I just want to know what you all think about this practice.

medicine,SALT-ED and SMART Trials published today possibly ending the debate on balanced fluids vs saline,"The NEJM published both studies online today. 

[SMART Trial- Balanced Fluids versus Saline in Critically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1711584?query=featured_home)

[SALT-ED Trial- Balanced Fluids versus Saline in Noncritically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1711586?query=featured_home)

These are sister studies performed at Vanderbilt over a 16 month period. Patients were randomized based on the month they arrived to the ER. The SMART trial had a primary outcome of a composite of death from any cause, new renal-replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction (defined as an elevation of the creatinine level to ≥200% of baseline). This composite outcome will undoubtedly be a point of contention from detractors, and I have to agree that I really do not like composite outcomes, especially when each individual component of the composite fails to meet statistical significance. Interestingly, however, the statistical significance of the SMART trials composite outcome seemed to primarily be driven by mortality. 

The SALT-ED trial strangely chose hospital free days as their primary outcome with major adverse kidney events being a secondary outcome. The trial failed at demonstrating a difference in primary outcome, but there was a significant difference in major adverse kidney events. 

Although I despise composite outcomes, I have to say that, for me, this is the final straw in the debate of saline vs balanced fluids. While some might argue that an NNT of something like 96, may not be clinically significant, the amount of fluids that are given in our ERs on a daily basis is enough for that NNT to be significant IMO.

pharmacy,Hospital pharmacists: share your fun stories of nurses claiming medications you personally tubed never arrived!,"I now work in a hospital where the policy is that we aren't allowed to re-utilize compounded IV medications once they've left the pharmacy, even though certain ones, at room temp, we can give them a 24-hour expiration (with the allowance of 24 hours after if they are hung and run within that time span.)  Especially in this time of the pre-made IV shortage crisis, it really blows when a nurse calls demanding the medication 30 seconds after the order is placed, but then claims they still haven't received it when you dropped everything else going on to ensure it was the next priority, after you either made it yourself or watched your tech make it and personally tube the medication.  

I had an instance recently, where an ER nurse screamed at my tech on the phone why the IV antibiotic wasn't there, an hour after I personally tubed it (and could back it up, because I was the last person to use that tube station and it showed that the last location tubed was to the main ER station.) and I had to waste my busy IV tech's time remaking it, just to get the original one tubed back with a pissy post-it note attached stating we tubed them a duplicate bag and to credit the patient!  I even played dumb and called the charge nurse pretending that I may have accidentally tubed an IV to their station asking if they could actually check the tube station if there was anything there and they instantly blurted ""there is nothing there!"" which is of course a BS response, because how would they know without taking the 10 seconds to waddle over to the station to look for me?!   

It's an age old story, but it just sucks that nurses are seemingly allowed to get away with such laziness in the fact that if the IV bag/oral medication is not literally in their hand, that it has not been tubed, despite the fact we know they haven't looked, right?  

In a younger, more idiotic and risk-taking past, as a stupid, but caviler pharmacist, I had the guts to march up to the floor when a particular lazy person called claiming the medication was not there after I personally tubed it, walked past them at the floor desk, took the tube out of the station, opened it up and put it in their hands, commenting to them that, yes I personally tubed it and now it's in your hands as proof!  (lucky I wasn't fired for doing that, but the pleasure of the shock on their face was almost worth the risk, but as I'm older would never do again!)
