medicine,Rheumatoid arthritis and becoming a doctor,"Quick background, I'm a 19 year old Australian girl who has her heart set and future focused on becoming a doctor. I'm also a 19 year old Australian girl with rheumatoid arthritis. It's pretty bad already, a lot of pain, stiffness, fatigue etc etc etc etc. I also get pretty bad side effects from the medication (Prednisone, Hydroxychloroquine, Panadol Osteo, Nexium and probably starting sulfasalazine in about 6 weeks).

I'm getting really worried that I won't be able to perform at my best due to it, mainly due to the stiffness. Conveniently though, I don't want to be a surgeon, so I won't be relying on my hands as much. I've had friends and relatives ask me if it is even worth it for me to go through with it, which has caused me to really question my decision to go into medicine. I wouldn't mind doing biomedical research, but medicine and the application of medicine is my really passion and drive in life.

So my question is, do any of you guys have a chronic disease/autoimmune disorder/arthritis of any description? How do you manage with it? Do you have any suggestions for how I go about managing a chronic, progressive disease while completing a medical degree? I just don't want to get my hopes up for a career in medicine to have all my dream shattered by this silly autoimmune disorder!",38,16,2012-07-01,PHARMA,0.13887682557106018,0.8362914323806763,0.024831697344779968

With the discussion of the enormous shortage of health care providers ahead of us, I hear several solutions get mentioned. A recent CNN article mentioned increasing Nurses, others have talked about the loss of Doctors and the lack of residency positions. I very rarely see PAs mentioned at all.

Additionally, I have heard of (not experienced) hostility towards PAs from other professions. Apparently Doctors are very love/hate with PAs, and NP's view PAs as ""stealing their patients."" There is an enormous amount of politics regarding the niche PAs are allowed to fill and will be allowed to fill in the future, but there seems to be an ""image"" that I was previously unfamiliar with.

Health,Anyone else allergic to cinnamon (or another thing that doesn't have to be specifically listed on ingredients list?,"I have recently developed a full blown allergy to cinnamon after having a sensitivity to it since childhood. What makes this difficult is that cinnamon can be included in 'spices' or 'natural flavorings.' I have contacted several companies, and they have all refused to tell me if cinnamon is included in their product. They say they are protected by the FDA and don't have to divulge proprietary information. How do you avoid something that doesn't have to labeled? I contacted the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) and they told me they couldn't help me other than advising me to stay away from anything that has spices or natural flavorings on the ingredient list. Go to your pantry and look at 10 products. How many do NOT have one of those? Yeah. So I have a list of things I know it is in, based on my reactions to them.

I'm a young MD nearing the end of my residency and have started actively planning on more or less selling my possessions and getting the heck out of Dodge. Specifically, I'm planning on traveling as much as possible, with as little as possible. Unfortunately, I still carry a significant loan burden from med school. What's the best way to manage this? I'm currently on the IBR plan, which will drop my payments to zero when my income more or less goes away. Of course, the interest will continue to pile up, but then it should be forgiven in 20 years under the recent loan reform, correct? I realize that I am signing myself up for living in poverty for at least two decades. Mostly I'm concerned about making sure that nothing can fall on my family. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

EDIT: Many people have been asking why I made this decision. As I've said below, there was no ""defining moment""; rather, this is a culmination of events. My complaints are no different from those that you hear from colleagues in daily practice, many of which you may harbor yourself. Long hours, high stress, defensive practice, insurance company nightmares, and on and on. What made the difference for me is that I realized I have no justification for pressing on. Others have children or an expensive lifestyle to support. I'm unattached and healthy with very little attaching me to others apart from family ties. My lifestyle is simple and I abhor extravagance.

I'm currently a CNA in my 2nd semester of nursing school (graduate next May). One of the things that a well-respected instructor told us is a doctor (based on their prior interactions with you) will put you on a ""bright"" or ""not so bright"" list. If a nurse is trusted by a doctor, they are grateful and so appreciative because that's one less thing they have to worry about. The reason she became an instructor is because a doctor explained to her that these schools are cranking out nurses like a factory, and a lot of them book smart, but lack clinical smarts. I want to be the nurse that you can trust. I want you to feel confident in me so that your mind is a bit more at ease while I'm taking care of your patient. So what are some ""no-nos"" you deal with a lot? 

**Edit** I have no idea what the downvotes are for. It's an honest question. This post wasn't to imply that all nurses do stupid things and doctors are perfect. Rather it's a learning opportunity for me as a soon-to-be new nurse. Oh well. Lol

I originally wanted to be a pharmacist because I love science, and the idea of using science to treat people made me happy.  But I shadowed a few retail pharmacists, and it seemed like most of the day was spent on the phone with insurance agencies.

Is that what pharmacists really do?  People tell me I'm smart (although I don't feel that way often) so I could probably do something else, but I imagine that is the case for most pharmacists, so what was it that made you know pharmacy was the right choice?

What's the best, most efficient way to stay up on my game in terms of important studies, medical news, and cool new gadgets? I read NEJM and JAMA regularly, and would love some tips on cool blogs that I could throw into Flipboard and read on my iPad in my downtime (if any if the rumors of the horrors of 3rd year prove true). 

So Meddit, hit me with your favorite sites!

Edit: I understand that looking up disease processes that are relevant for my patients is going to occupy the bulk of my time. I by no means plan on using primary sources. Talking to higher ups, the consensus seems to be to use UpToDate, Dynamed, Epocrates, Diagnosaurus, etc. for the day-to-day grind.

I obviously had the gunner comments coming (my douchy user name certainly isn't helping things). It's one thing to be up on your shit and be ready for pimping (and knowing what's going on with your patient). That's not what I was trying to get at. I truly am fascinated with current trends in medicine, and that's what I was seeking help for. I don't need the details of a new statin study, but I do like reading the tagline for big trials at a BBC level, not a PubMed level. I like reading about the crazy new robot that runs like a human, or how NASA has made biocapsules that might make unmanaged diabetes a thing of the past in a decade. I like knowing about what's going on with ObamaCare and how it's going to affect the way I practice, without the frivolous details of legislature. What I was looking for was a blog type deal that was similar to Lifehacker or Gizmodo, but for medicine. Big picture stuff, that probably doesn't have anything to do with the way I treat patients (protocols, double blinds, etc).

Atrioventricular Reentrant tachycardia seems to be similar except that you have two 'loops' that form in the AV node. One fast and one slow (really confused by this part).

pharmacy,Let's talk about how /r/pharmacy feels about the Affordable Care Act and the potential impacts it could have on the profession.,"I did a subreddit search and did not find any discussions about this.

As difficult as it might seem let's try to keep political and ethical viewpoints out of it. If you want to debate whether or not health care is a right there are posts in other subreddits for that.

That being said, I am very interested to hear what impacts you (practicing pharmacists, pharmacy students, patients) think the Affordable Care Act will have on the profession. I have heard plenty of physicians express their disapproval but I feel like pharmacists (the ones I know) have stayed pretty tight lipped about it.

Interesting points of discussion might include changes to the pharmacist's role in patient care, compensation, drug prices, demand for jobs, Pharm.D education, or anything else you find relevant.

I am a pharmacy student and will admit that I don't know all of the components of the legislation. My impression from what I have heard/read thus far has been a negative one. Here's a few things that come to mind.

A.) **Greater generic availability** - sounds great on the surface. Cheaper drugs available to more people, hopefully increasing health across the board. On the flip side, we all know the front-end costs that drug companies incur on bringing a new drug to market and the research dollars that went into developing that drug and dozens of other drugs that won't ever see the market. I feel like cheaper prices and/or shorter patents will lower the reward for innovation that drug companies receive and in the long run it could decrease the quality and quantity of new drugs that they pump out.

B.) **Changes in reimbursement** - still not clear on all dynamics of this. If I had to take a stab in the dark I would say 3rd party reimbursement pay in both community and clinical settings will decrease. If this happens I think those changes will be reflected in RPh salary. Possibly through mandatory mail order? I don't know, just brainstorming.

C.) **Pay by performance measures** - will pharmacist pay be based on how many times their patients skip a dose or refill medications? Not likely, but I do think it is possible for aspects of the physician compensation model to trickle into pharmacy, especially in clinical settings.

D.) **Greater role in patient care** - this is the only possible outcome that has come to my mind that seems positive. If pharmacy is given a greater scope of practice it could increase jobs by creating new roles for the Pharm.D to fill.

That's all I have for now. So now I want to hear - what do you think?

Health,"My fiance passed three kidney stones in the past 24 hours, is on his ~50th kidney stone in 5 years, and we need some guidance.","I am turning to the reddit community, mostly because we've googled about everything possible. 

He's been to many urologists, nephrologists, etc. in the past few years, and they all are confused. He has passed almost 20 already this year, most of which are small (~1 or 2mm) but the last three were quite large (&gt;4mm). It's hard to find new information online, so I thought I'd see if anyone has heard of or experienced something like this.  I'm not looking for generic advice such as ""Drink more water"" or ""Change your diet,"" just because he's done all of this. He currently drinks a lot of water, avoids foods high in oxalate and nothing has worked. He takes potassium citrate, but we don't believe that has stopped the formation. It's hard to tell, as he still has ~15 stones waiting to come out. Since he's running out of options, he is now turning to an herbal remedy (chanca piedra). Though, if chanca piedra works as well as it's supposed to, it could be the reason behind passing three stones in the past 24 hours.

Helpful information: He also has IBS, has had shingles recently, has somewhat-frequent headaches and a mess of other issues. None are life-threatening, but all are very annoying for him to deal with. We've come across some information about hyperparathyroidism, but his doctor said his calcium levels are normal, so that kind of rules out that possibility. So basically, we're stumped. 

I really feel bad for him, and I know this is especially aggravating to him too, so I'd welcome any experiences or information you all have on the topic.

pharmacy,Pharmacists getting provider status,"I recently talked to several pharmacy organizations. My question was what would it take to get pharmacists provider status. Provider status would mean pharmacists could be reimbursed and get many other benefits (like loan repayment for serving underprivileged areas). 

Until pharmacists gain provider status our profession will stay in a product oriented state instead of a service provided state. Currently the Veterans Administration, a government organizations that serves American soldiers, has recognized that pharmacists are underutilized and now use pharmacists for ambulatory care (making sure patients know what their medications are for, how to use them, and adjusting and prescribing medications). Patients that are followed by pharmacists do much better and are less likely to end up in the Emergency Department. 

What would it take for provider status? 3-5 million dollars put towards lobbying. I think this is the most important obstacle facing pharmacists. It seems that no organization is making this their priority. To put this in terms there are over 50,000 hospital pharmacists, which means if every pharmacist donated $100 we could change the landscape of Pharmacy.

I want to start an organization strictly to raise money for this purpose. I have zero experience doing anything like this. I have a few questions, such as could this be considered a nonprofit, and I could really use help (website development, recruiting, and of course donations).",21,19,2012-07-11,PHARMA,0.02174319326877594,0.9379739761352539,0.04028279334306717

Health,"Recently, being told frequently that I look like/am a man.  How to self-advocate for the best medical evaluation?  No insurance, difficulty in recent past getting care.","I am uninsured.  Last year I presented with cognitive, speech and vision problems, I wasn't given what I'd understood to be standard diagnostic care, presumably due to my lack of insurance.  They just shone a light at my fundus, said it looked healthy, and told me I had been having migraines without headaches.

Over the past two years, I have had people begin aggressively approaching me to tell me I look like a man.  I am a 27-year-old woman (healthy weight, looking young for my age).  At first, I attributed it to pure meanness and perversion--these people are usually rednecks, and I do have small breasts and a large nose--but more and more people seem to be commenting on this more frequently, both to my face and within earshot.  My facial features seem to be coarsening (one side of my nasal cartilage has grown lower, my chin seems rounder, my face seems longer), that side of my face has been sore above and below the eye, I have acquired localized hypertrichosis on that side of my forehead, and although I'm blonde with mostly very fine blonde hair on my arms and legs, I've had coarse dark hairs popping up around my areolae--so I have excess hair growth in places both sensitive and insensitive to androgens.

I've discussed the body hair during a gynecological visit.  The nurse who performed the exam was Mexican-American and she reassured me that the nipple hair is normal for some women. . . I argued briefly, and she dismissed my argument that it might not be so normal for blonde Northern Europeans (my brother and dad can hardly grow facial or chest hair, and no women in my family have this problem).

I am not looking for medical advice!  I am looking for information that will help me approach my GP and get some serious consideration of this set of symptoms.  What sorts of diseases can I ask her to investigate?  How do you suggest that I assert my concerns and urge her to take them seriously?  I'm normally extremely polite when I visit the doctor, and I think that my manners imply a cheerful, carefree outlook, making it easier to assume my symptoms aren't so bad; typically, I end up feeling like my concerns aren't really given much thought.  Any advice or suggestions of reading would be appreciated greatly.

Health,I may have broken a toe. Not from the States but living here for the next two months and don't know what my options are.,"Freaking out a little bit!

So, I'm here on a work and travel visa. I have insurance on Mapfre but i'm not entirely sure about the terms of my policy. Or how the health system/insurance claims work in general. (I've never had health insurance back home and thankfully never broken a bone or needed serious medical assistance before.)

Here's how it happened: jumping a 3-4 foot fence. Just landed weirdly on my left foot and straight away I kinda knew toe number 4 felt weird and swollen. I checked it after I got home about 2 hours later and it's sticking up and kind of bent the wrong way. The top knuckle is bent normally, with the pad of the toe pointing towards the ground. But the bottom knuckle is basically bent the other way, so it vaguely resembles a (still pretty straight) s/squiggle shape. Also, I bruised the same toe kinda badly 2 or 3 weeks ago when I stubbed it off a rock at the beach, so that could be contributing.

I don't have money to go to a doctor (living off ten dollars until tuesday). I am wondering what my options are. If I do go to a doctor/hospital, do I not have to pay at all if my insurance covers it? Or do I have to pay, and then make a claim to get it back? Should I ring insurance to ask about my policy, or can that affect my claims negatively in any way? 

Also, if anyone knows a lot about toes and thinks this definitely is or isn't broken, I'd love to hear about it. I'm not primarily looking for a diagnosis here, but I'm open to hearing from people who know what they're talking about.


Also, I feel like a total idiot for not researching all of this stuff before I came over/being crap with money/breaking my toe/turning to the internet for medical advice.

Health,I lost hearing in my left ear over the stupidest thing.,"I was taking a shower. This happened when I was twelve (nineteen now). Most shower heads give you the option of using the ""shower"" spray and the powerful ""jet stream"" one. Being clumsy me, I switched to the jet stream, accidentally moved my hand down a few inches and bam! The water shot into my ear. In that instant, I became deaf (and as I now believe, permanently). The only ""sound"" in my left ear, since then, is this constant buzzing, szzzzhhh sound. It never goes away. Its noticeability varies from time to time though. 
My mother took me to a ENT specialist, where they did several tests (including a CT scan to check for a tumor). He told me that my ear looked COMPLETELY normal and was ""puzzled"" by the ""sudden, unexplainable loss"". He also told me that I had a ""10% chance"" of regaining hearing in my left ear. We tried other things like acupuncture (3 months) but I gave up in the end. The acupuncturist, though, somehow ruled out nerve damage, which he said was irreversible. 

My life has really gone down hill since then, especially when it comes to socializing. Most of the time, I would have to turn my head around so that my right ear is facing the speaker's mouth to hear. I hate having to explain them that I wasn't being rude afterwards.

4) Which procedure is the best in regards to longevity and least complications? Lasek, lasik, that other one?

To remedy my apparently primary chronic insomnia, my mom tried every herb and ""homebrew"" cure for sleeplessness, while my dad has given me every over-the-counter sleeping pill. They worked for a little bit, but none have lasted to this day. They also refuse to take me to the doctor's for it.
 
I just recently graduated high school, and am going to college. The ""summer vacation"" never had an effect on my sleep pattern, but this time around it is different.
 
Within the past week and a half, I've gotten a total of 7 hours of ""good"" (REM) sleep. I ""wake"" up feeling just as bad as going to sleep. Sleeping has become problematically useless to me, and have begun showing physical, but not mental, signs of sleep deprivation. I feel nauseated and vertigo, but no hallucinations or headaches.

pharmacy,Careers in pharmacy law?,"Hi everyone, I'm currently a law student who also works full-time in the health insurance industry and I've become interested in the field of pharmacy after speaking with a coworker recently. There's very limited information on the internet about pharmacy law, so I have a few general comments/questions that I'm hoping will get a conversation started: 

1. I'm not eager to go out and get a Pharm.D. on top of my law degree, but I would really like to have an edge in the pharmacy industry when I go on to practice law.  Do you have any suggestions as to how to gain some experience/knowledge? Don't tell me to just go read a book (unless you have a really good one in mind).

2. Please tell me about any experiences you have had with pharmacy lawyers/law in general.  

3. Now I know that ""pharmacy law"" is quite broad; there's everything from pharmaceutical patent lawyers to tort litigators. I'm particularly interested in taking a counsel/consultant/legal compliance role for a firm or insurance company. What do you think? Is there a particular sub-field in pharmacy (e.g. pandemic drugs [excuse my ignorance]) that you think is going to be hot in a few years and will have high demand for lawyers?

I'm trying to create a niche for myself by going into pharmacy law. If you weren't already aware, the legal profession is extremely saturated right now. I strongly believe that a lot of recent law grads are not getting jobs because they have no expertise.  I figure that if I can take some initiative early on and have a plan, I won't end up getting screwed with a law degree. So help me out reddit, huh?

Health,I functionally cured my Crohn's disease by following the Specific Carbohydrate Diet.  AMA!,"Quick summary:  I was diagnosed with Crohn's when I was 11 years old.  I was in extreme pain, using the bathroom &gt;10 times a day, stopped growing, had a constant fever and couldn't get out of bed.  I was initially treated with anti-inflammatory drugs (which didn't help at all) before being upgraded to Prednisone (a steroid).  Prednisone effectively turned me into a zombie, and I was still very sick, missing over 60 days of school in 6th grade.  My doctors began discussing my other options, which included surgery and moving up to immunosuppressant drugs.  At this point, a family friend suggested I try the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD).  Within a month, I was putting on weight, using the bathroom less than 3 times a day, and growing for the first time in a year.  By following the diet, I have been able to maintain remission for the past 11 years, only taking probiotics and occasionally anti-inflammatory medication (non-steroidal).  Crohn's no longer limits my life.. I just finished up college at a big state University, have traveled to 13 countries in the past year and a half (!), and am starting my first job this August!
Short description of the diet:  Cuts out all complex carbs and starches, including cane sugar, flour, grains, potatoes, and some dairy.  The foods that I can eat are really delicious... all meats, fruits, veggies, beans, nuts and cheese(&lt;3333)!

thing is, when we have drinks together he often starts beating himself up and talking very pessimistically. he lets me know that he has always had confidence issues, he's terrified of his father's declining health, his mother had emotionally abused him in his childhood, and other things which lead to his unhappiness.

i love lending an ear and trying to help out but my suggestions never really seem to resonate with him. last night we talked about therapy and that even his boss suggested he consider talking to someone about his confidence issues.

the strange part of it is that he's totally receptive to the idea of psychology...for other people. however, for him to undergo therapy would be admitting that he's faulty, or diseased, or emotionally unstable. i tried to convey to him that none of these are true and that by seeking therapy for mental health issues that you struggle to resolve is in fact a healthy approach.

pharmacy,As a floating intern pharmacist I see a lot of stuff going on that would make me quite uncomfortable once I'm fully licensed. Thoughts? Advice?,"I work for a major chain in California. I float from store to store. Here are a few things that make me quite uncomfortable, but I'm not sure what, if anything, I can/should do about it.

1) California law mandates that if there is only one pharmacist on duty then there may only be one technician. There may be as many clerks as the rph feels comfortable with, two pharmacist interns, one technician extern. When there are two pharmacists there may be three techs. Clerks may ring up scripts, type scripts, and accept refills. Now in this chain I constantly see two techs per pharmacist. One of those techs should be working as a ""clerk,"" doing nothing but clerk duties in order for it to be legal. But both the techs do tech work (ie filling scripts, restocking drugs, etc).  An inspection by the board could land me fine if I'm the rph on duty at the time. 

2) California requires mandatory counseling on ALL new scripts, copies, and changes in dose or directions. Techs must instruct all patients to go to the counseling window if their script falls in these categories. I routinely see/hear ""do you want a consultation with this?"" I rarely see a tech direct the patient to the counseling window unless the patient asks for it. Not only is this illegal and could result in a fine, but it is dangerous! As an intern I've learned that patients don't know shit about their drugs or their side effects. It's important they talk with a pharmacist. 

I'll leave it at two. These are the things that bug me the most though there are a few other things that strike the wrong chord. 

Once I am working as a pharmacist I will demand any tech I work with to follow the laws. If they don't I'll report them. If I'm a manager I'll write them up. If corporate doesn't do anything to remedy the situation I'll report the pharmacy to the board.  This makes me seem like a bitch, but it's my license on the line. 

*tl;dr* I know counseling takes a lot of time, we are slammed with scripts, have corporate deadlines and goals to meet, and are usually understaffed, but I don't think that is sufficient reason to blatantly ignore the law.

Health,"Getting some weird symptoms, not sure what it is","Hi all


Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I've started feeling a bit weird. My vision's all screwy, have a pretty big blindspot in my vision. Everything seems a bit brighter than normal as well, kind of like staring at the sun too long.  
I'm also feeling a bit light-headed and off balance. It's not a drunk kind of feeling, but definitely not feeling normal.

Does this sound like something anyone else has experienced? Is it something I need to worry about? It's not affecting my work so far, can still carry a conversation and obviously still work a PC, but haven't experienced something like this so far.


It started happening about 2 hours or so ago.


**EDIT:** Thanks for the replies all. The vision and balance problems have now gone away thankfully, but I feel a bit of a headache coming on...  
Seems like this might be a migraine, which if it is would be the second one I've ever gotten in my life. Not taking any chances though, on the way to the doc to get an official take on things.

Thanks again for the responses, will update on what the doc had to say.

**UPDATE:** According to the doc it was most likely the onset of a migraine. Strangely, the headache that followed (so far) was (or again, so far) nowhere near as vicious as I was expecting (previous time this happened it was only preempted by a blindspot, then nauseating pain 30 minutes later).

medicine,Fellow MDs of reddit: What can one do to remove or replace another physician from a case where you believe he is causing harm?,"Inspired by a recent related thread...

I have my own ideas on the matter, which I have cultivated over many years, but I'm sure I'm not the only who has dealt with these situations, and I'm curious as to the thoughts of others on this.  I am usually not the admitting physician, so when a consultant is called to a case, whom I believe is either incompetent and/or causing harm to the patient, either by negligence or incompetence, how can I remove and replace that consultant without upsetting the delicate political and social balance of hospital affairs?  

EDIT: Without revealing too much information, here is the usual situation I find myself in.  I am also a subspecialty consultant and I often notice another consultant on a case who is incompetent or otherwise doing wrong by the patient.  I cannot very well tell that consultant off.  If the patient or family asks me about an issue relating to that consultant, I have to watch my mouth about implicating the consultant in faulty care.  I also cannot necessarily inform the primary.  These consultants often have close reciprocal relationships with primaries, so for me to come in and question them would portray me as the villain and would do nothing to alter the care.  I'd sooner find myself removed from the case!  I have often mentioned this to my own department head who has occasionally acted on my behalf, talking to other department heads about the problem.  But this is rare and only in the most egregious instances.  Most of the time, he advises me to be passive-aggressive about it.

Health,3 year itch... and counting. Photos provided.,"**Symptoms:**

1. Itchy skin. 

2. Often (but not always) accompanied by a rash. Example: [torso](http://i.imgur.com/Ml7qB.jpg), [forearm](http://i.imgur.com/ounlk.jpg), [wrist](http://i.imgur.com/gzuwT.jpg). 

**Duration:**

The itch lasts anywhere from several hours to several days.

**Occurrence:**

I'll usually get one episode every week or two (first occurrence was early 2009.)

**Location:**

Localized in patches. Usually on my: 

1. Neck, chest and/or shoulders.

2. Torso: stomach, sides and/or back

4. Arms (rarely does it get all the way down to my fingers.)

5. Inner thighs and groin region (never my genitals, thankfully.) 

**Things I've tried:**

1. Antihistamines: drowsy and non-drowsy (didn't help.)

2. Hydrocortizone (Only helped mildly; possibly a placebo effect.)

3. Changed detergents/soaps/creams to unscented and hypoallergenic varieties.

4. Avoiding the sun.

5. Had my bed checked for bugs (I live in a new building, but you never know!)

6. Ice packs (soothes the itch/rash.)

7. Several over-the-counter itch remedies (with no avail.)

**Plea for help:**

Has anyone else experienced this?  Any trouble-shooting suggestions?

Health,"Sudden, constant Low blood pressure. Feeling Exhausted. What the heck is happening?? Please Please help?","I know this is a lot of information, but I have no idea what else to do. I included a Tl;Dr at the end, but all of the information you would need to know is in the bulk of the message... My sister, Caucasian, 29, 219lbs, fairly active, has had a sudden drop of blood pressure, starting last week. It stays between 103 over 65 to 95 over 55 (taken with an at home blood-pressure wrist cuff). She has been feeling exhausted. Tiring easily, needing to sleep more, i.e. she slept for 15 hours yesterday and was still tired when she got up. I'm really worried, and will try to include as much information about her/her diet as I can. She can't go to a doctor because her jobs don't offer health coverage, and can't really afford to go/take time off work.

She had the gastric bypass done a year and a month ago, and has lost 160lbs, but has done it steadily over the past year. No sudden weight loss/gain.

She is on no medication.

She goes between two jobs, so her working/eating schedule is messed up. She goes to work Sunday and Monday 10pm-8am, Wednesday and Thursday from 3-11pm, Friday and Saturday 11pm-7am. 

Her diet/eating habit is basically: Eating periodically during the day/night (Not really enough to be called meals). So she will eat small sugar free/natural sugar snacks, such as; 5-6 snack-sized bags of dried fruit crisps/chips, mainly pineapple (.84oz), but also adds apple (.35oz), and banana (.42oz), over the span of one night/work shift. She will also have the odd sugar free cookie, and maybe a chicken sandwich or 1-2 beef tacos that is eaten over the span of one night/work shift. 

Her drinks include: 1-2 Diet pepsi or coke 20 oz bottles at home/work. She will also drink 1-2 6 hour energy shots, or one 8oz can of sugar free red bull if she is feeling tired (at work only). But, in the past week, she has had to take 2-3 energy shots and a can of redbull just to go to work/get up. 

Tl;Dr- my sister, 29, had a sudden, unexplained drop in blood pressure, has been feeling exhausted, and has no idea what to do. She hasn't changed anything she has been doing or eating! She had the gastric bypass done a year ago (is still losing weight at a healthy pace), so she eats many small snacks (sugar free) or meals (a sandwich) during the day and while she is working (she works a lot/constantly). She has been having to drink 2-3 sugar free energy shots and a sugar free redbull just to get up. She usually works out after work, but can't muster the energy to do it right now.

Medicines for nausea for me have always been terrible. Even with the slightest nausea pepto won't do anything (though I use it for other reasons). 

However Cola Syrup helps me even when its moments away. 

My girlfriend last night was very sick, she had a severe headache which lead to nausea. She said she might need a bucket and was worried about throwing up the advil since her head still hurt so bad. 

I went and got her some Cola Syrup and within 2 minutes easy she was starting to feel better, I had her stay sitting a bit longer but within 10 minutes she was laying down and starting to fall asleep. She went from unable to lay down due to strong nausea to sleeping in 10 minutes. How is this stuff not everywhere?

That being said it has a ton of calories (not that you care at the moment) and is best served over crushed ice (We end up using cubed).

I'm an American but part of me wants to move out of the country (Maybe Canada, New Zealand, the UK, or Australia). 

My questions are as follows:

1) How difficult would it be to work as a doctor in your country, both in regards to restrictions within the medical community and within immigration?

2) Would you recommend going to University and Med School in the US or in your country, one or both?

3) How do you feel about the healthcare system in your country in regard to workload, enjoyment, and pay? Do you like your system or would you prefer ours?

4) How are American doctors viewed in your country, do they turn many heads? Are they viewed positively or negatively?

5) Vacation Time? I love traveling but I'm not sure I'd have time according to our system, how much time off do you get, and are you ""punished"" for taking it? 

In regards to language, I do know German, although it's probably not good enough to learn or doctor anyone up unless I brush it up some, and with so many different dialects and accents, even that probably wont be enough :).

Health,Bitten: What to expect in the days following a brown recluse spider bite.,"So, let me front this with saying that I have seen a doctor (2 in fact) about this. I know it is a spider bite. I have the brown recluse spider that bit me. 

Story: I am taking a shower, soaping up, when I reach for the hair conditioner. I feel a pin prick and something on my finger and freak out. I throw the bottle at the wall and see a spider hit the edge of the tub. It it missing a leg or two, but twitching and intact. I notice it has the violin shape on the back. Bam! It hits me. Brown recluse. I remember the pin prick that I felt and look at my finger. It looks like nothing. I don't even see the fang marks, but I notice a bit of pain. I am not sure if that is the panic mode setting in and it is merely psychological or if I am really experiencing bite pain. 

I call the medical exchange number for my local doctor's office. They tell me to go to the urgent care center, but it closed 30 minutes before. I call poison control because I am out of ideas. They tell me to go to the emergency room to be safe. I consider skipping that because it only hurts a bit, maybe, and the doctor's office will be open in about 12 hours or so, but then I googled "" brown recluse spider bite"" and freaked myself out. I decide to go because I have insurance and have already met my deductible for the year, and I am little worried at this point.    

Doctor at the emergency looks at the spider and my ""bite"" mark and says it is definitely a brown recluse and that is definitely a little bite mark. He says there isn't much he can do but gives me some benedryl and some pain medication and tells me to follow up with my primary care doctor. Right as I leave he says, "" If you notice symptoms of an allergy, increasing intense pain, chest pains, an itch that spreads past the wound area, necrosis of the wound area, or anything else alarming, please come back.""  

A little pain all through the night and a little whiteness on the wound area but nothing alarming. I head to my PCP this morning and he says basically the same thing, there is nothing they can do but treat any symptoms that appear. He tells me to expect an ulcer that will go away fairly quickly. It could get rather big. He also notes that necrosis could take up to 96 hours to appear. 

Now I am playing the waiting game. I know what to look out for, but I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with this type of bite. I am going on just under about 20 hours so my rational self is telling me that everything is going to be ok. And of course something like only 10% or so cases actually exhibit necrosis. The pain is still pretty much there, but it isn't debilitating or anything close to that. 

There is a lot of information out there about it, but it was hard to get any real concrete information from the doctors I saw. One had never seen a bite from that spider before and the other had limited experience. 

Anybody know if my condition could change dramatically over the next 96 hours or so? 

Edit: Thanks everyone for your personal stories on bites and your advice! I woke up this morning with no redness and absolutely no pain. I think there might have been some confusion on how much pain I was experiencing. It was seriously minimal, like when you get stuck with a pin or get a paper cut and it aches for a bit but gradual gets better. There was a call for picture so I have posted some below. There isn't much to see. 

The [first](http://i.imgur.com/CQFOj.jpg) one is from 20 hours post bite. It is a bit red. The bite marks are near the top but you can't really see anything in the picture because of how small it is.        

And the [second](http://i.imgur.com/lwVYk.jpg) one is from about 36 hours post bite. The redness has really lessened and you can't even see the marks anymore.          

I am still watching it closely but I am really optimistic about my prognosis. I have a follow up with my PCP in a few days just to make sure everything is clear. 

Thanks again!",33,54,2012-07-31,PHARMA,0.10554111003875732,0.870434045791626,0.02402487024664879

medicine,I have a question for doctors about medical history and why we give it out... x-post from r/health,"I'm not asking for any kind of medical advice, I was just curious about something...

I went to the local walk-in clinic because my eye had been red and irritated for about a week... I've been there many times before and they had my files on record, but some things needed updating. I updated what I needed to and waited like a normal person.

I get called back and the doctor asks me the regular questions, how long has my eye been red, does it hurt bla bla bla... then he notices that there were changes to my records, so he wanted to complete some other changes. He asked me the regular questions, about my allergies, my past surgeries ect, then out of the blue he asks ""are you circumcised?"" 

What?! How is this relevant in any way? I don't go here for STD tests or any test involving my genitalia, yet he asked. I answered, but it still struck me as odd...

So doctors, why do you need to know this as a part of medical history and background? what can this help with, especially when it was a situation like mine, where I was there to have my *eye* checked?

**TL;DR**: updating my medical history and the doctor asked if I was circumcised, and I am curious as to why they needed to know that.

**PS** I should add that I'm 17 and my mother was with me so I didn't ask the doctor why he needed to know that... because I don't talk about that stuff around my mother. Its strange. 

**EDIT:** I don't know exactly where I could ask this question, so I just searched for any health and medicine related subreddits to ask as many people as possible.",24,12,2012-07-31,PHARMA,0.05036748945713043,0.9197421669960022,0.02989036962389946

Health,"Been sick for more than 2 weeks now. Saw a doctor already, should I go see him again?","I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/wtwi9/feeling_sick_for_almost_4_days_now/) days ago to try to understand my condition, but its not over yet. I would say my condition is better nowadays but I still feel weak, my muscles ache all over and I've had bloodshot eyes for a few days now. But the fever is gone for good, I'm not shivering and I no longer have lower appetite. 

I went to the hospital's emergency room on that saturday (FYI this is in Montreal, free healthcare). Took some blood test, had an abdominal scan/ultrasound done the next morning and saw the doctor again, then had more blood tests saw the doctor one last time on tuesday July 24th. He basically told me that he thought it may be mono, but thats not it, it is just some virus. So he gave me an appointment to see him again on August 10 when he believes my symptoms will be gone, and he gave me a week off from work (IT tech support by phone).

Today my week off was over, so I came in work regardless of how I felt. My boss saw me and told me I do not look good and he's worried that I am in proper working shape, and he said I might need to see the doctor again. As much as I want to see the doctor again, can something actually be done? Should I just wait until August 10 for my appointment or should I have the hospital check me out some more?",6,11,2012-07-31,PHARMA,0.05153001844882965,0.8828680515289307,0.06560185551643372
Health,I am not very flexible. What are some ways any non flexible people have slowly worked up to becoming nicely flexible?,"I've love advice from people who used to be not flexible at all, who worked up to becoming quite flexible.

Let me just say, I can barely touch my toes without bending my knees! I am a female, will be 21 years old in two months... thin and fit, and people assume because of that, I must be flexible. But I am not. I would love tips and helpful hints on how to become flexible. Exercises to do daily that will help me do a complete split, and bending my body in various ways. Sticking a leg straight up without bending it. I understand some people are born more flexible than others. But anything at this point will make me more flexible! :)

Edit: Thank you for the input, everyone!! Super appreciated :) I am definitely considering starting slowly with yoga.",15,10,2012-07-31,PHARMA,0.032188329845666885,0.9155162572860718,0.05229545757174492
