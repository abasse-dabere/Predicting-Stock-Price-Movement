Could we see pharmacy schools do the same with the PCAT?,"Basically, law schools may no longer use the LSAT as part of the admissions process, claiming to want to diversify their applicant pool to include people from different educational backgrounds of science and art.

medicine,Why Your Culture Matters To Me,"In 2016, I was taking a class classed called cultural awareness. I was a second year health professions student, still in my didactic course work. I had some limited contact with patients and I incorrectly thought I knew everything. I was also not an excellent student at the time and I did not appreciate the class, as I should have. I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3zs1hg/why_your_culture_does_not_matter_to_me/) article to see if anyone agreed with my poorly informed opinion and posted it on the r/medicine subreddit, plus maybe one or two other health related subreddits (sorry, I forgot the password to the throwaway that I wrote it on). Truthfully, I did not know what I believed and wanted to see what people with more experience thought.   

I wanted to come back and write a follow up now that I have actually interacted with patients and seen them through treatments. I want to explain to anyone who may be frustrated with the monotony of coursework, as I was, why the view I presented in the mentioned article is misguided and just silly in a practical context.  

Healthcare educations are built mostly on evidence-based research. We are tested numerous times on the facts related to disease, treatments, and outcomes. It is drilled into us to be perfectionists with excellent memories, guided by our knowledge of the research to make decisions concerning our patients. With that mindset, we are expected to explain treatment to patients and then make the best decisions with them accordingly. Schools minimally teach about patient culture and how healthcare providers need to interact with patients, though it is increasingly being taught and for good reason.  

With the mindset of evidence being king, it is easy to blame patients for their problems. Why would anyone ever smoke? Can’t they just see how much it hurts them and quit? Why would anyone take their kid to a medicine man in their neighborhood? A doctor should be their first choice. I went to school and know the answer to their problem. They would get better if they just listened to the treatment I am offering. And so on.  

What this mindset does not take into account is that patients are people, and people are whom we are treating. It sounds like a bumper sticker, but it is true and I mean people in the most literal sense of the word. People have blood, veins, bones, nerves, organs, and cells. People also have pasts, preconceived notions of what they expect, beliefs hammered into them since birth, desires and dreams, families who rely on them and who they rely on, neighbors they talk to, pastors they listen to, a smartphone they search with, bills to pay and money to manage, elders they learned from. I.e. their culture. Throwing a paper from Pubmed in their face and hitting them with the wordy evidence is hardly going to address any of these other concerns. Even if you are right, it is not in context for the patient, and thus does not help them know why they should care. Patients do not typically have formal medical training, they rely on these other things to help them make their decisions. They come to you because they trust healthcare providers to understand the things that make them people and help them make decisions to improve their health in that context.   

Have you ever tried to really argue against something someone really believes? If you have, did you try to tell them how wrong they were and why you were right? Shortly after that, I would not be surprised if they dug in and held their view even more firmly than before, or at best halfheartedly changed their mind after an hour of bickering and hated you for it.  

Instead, maybe you tried to understand why they think the way they do before rushing to push your idea, like I should have done. People want to be understood. They want to see that their healthcare provider can listen to them instead of just viewing them as a fever with malaise, a toothache, a sore throat, or a backache. People want their problems to be fixed, but they are not machines that can take a formulaic input and perfectly accept it to get ideal treatment. They need to understand you in a context that is relevant to them. Their culture needs to accept treatment because that is where they derive their understanding. When they feel like you understand them, it allows you to explain why your treatment can help them in a way they can understand. You can do your job more effectively. If you have ever had a really great or incredibly effective healthcare provider, think about how they acted. Were they egomaniacs, bent on being the smartest guy in the room? Did they shove an article backing up their point in your face? No, they understood you and explained the things that they studied in answer to your problem in your 'language' and you willingly accepted treatment because of how they understood your problem.  

Treating patients *well* requires you to understand them. You need to know your anatomy. You need to choose sound, evidence-based treatment options. You need to inform your patients of these options. You need to strictly follow your ethics. And of course there are emergency situations and some circumstances where this argument may not apply and action is necessary to save someone. You are still a healthcare provider and you have your own culture that you must abide by as well. But you also need to understand whom you are treating and what got them there in order to effectively do your job and help the patient.   

I have learned a lot in two years and have a lot more to learn, but damn, if I ever need to feel humble, I look back on the person I was when I wrote that article and hope I have even an ounce more sense than that misguided person did. It is medical *practice* and no one gets it right every time. Try to understand your patient’s culture. Higher acceptance and better, more effective treatment will follow. Your evidence matters to your decision making, but your patients' cultures matter to how you are able to apply your decisions and their ultimate effectiveness for patient health.

I welcome any discussion.

pharmacy,Identifying eRx Prenatal Vitamins,"There’s an office near me that often sends over prenatals with names that our eRx system doesn’t recognize as being linked to any particular brand or generic, and finding the appropriate prenatal often proves difficult.

For example, this is one we received the other day:

&gt; prenatal vitamin no.7-iron 28 mg-folic acid 1.25 mg-dha 200 mg capsule

That’s exactly how it came in from the office’s eRx software.

Barring calling the office for the specific brand they want, is there any way to find which prenatal this is? Googling the phrase will find you matching “monographs” on Kaiser and WebMD that contain no information.

The closest we could find was Vitafol Ultra (which has 29 mg iron, 1 mg folate, and 200 mg DHA).

Upon viewing detailed information in our system on a common prenatal, I saw it had “prenatal no. 22” (or some other number, can’t recall). This makes me think there’s a list out there somewhere with a list of these prenatal numbers that could make identifying these odd eRx’s less ambiguous.

Having seen thousands of patients' charts over the years, I like reading mine sometimes. Lab and imaging results show up there as soon as they are available (rather than the days it takes for the patient portal to post some), and I enjoy seeing my own healthcare *from the inside*, so to say. With that being said, I am sensitive to the thoughts of the professionals involved in my care and wouldn't want to do something that may make them feel uneasy or compromise the way they treat me or document my care. I have not told my physicians that I read my chart, and if you all think it is not my place to do so, I will stop doing so out of respect for them.

For example, ""Your loved one has a high white blood cell count and needs to see a specialist"" when there are a ton of blasts on the smear, all the B-symptoms, lymphadenopahy, and petechiae all over the place. 

I've always been of the opinion that if an MD orders the test and finds out there is something seriously wrong, it is their duty to tell the family. Obviously, if they're unsure or if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, that's a different story. I always felt that you can at least say, ""I'm concerned your loved one has a form of blood cancer and we're sending you now to a hospital with cancer specialists."" 

Recently, however, I've heard other professionals say it ISN'T the referring MD's obligation because they don't have answers the the inevitable questions that will follow, and that it isn't fair to the patient/family to drop a bombshell and then not be able to give any further information. 

Thoughts????

TL/DR: If an MD orders a test and the results reveal a life-changing diagnosis (eg cancer, other serious chronic conditions,) does that MD have an obligation to share the results with the patient or should that information and discussion be left to the specialists after a referral is made?",121,228,2018-01-06,PHARMA,0.13263759016990662,0.8448449969291687,0.02251741662621498

pharmacy,Drug interaction. Prescriber unavailable. Patient has no idea what's going on. How do we proceed as pharmacists without putting our license at risk?,"I'm a new grad. Been pharming for a few months now.

You can just skip to 2) if this is too long.

I fucking hate this part of my job. I fucking hate the ER, they never know what meds a patient is taking. I fucking hate PA's. They prescribe the dumbest shit and can't write a legal script to save their lives...

Ok rant over. What the fuck am I supposed to do sometimes? I feel like its such a challenge to get clarification from a prescriber sometimes and I get thrown into a situation where I have to put my license on the line for someone else's incompetence.

Two specific examples happened this weekend and I would like your opinion:

1) PA wrote a script for oxycodone. It was for more than a 72 hour supply. It had some scribbling on it that kind of looks like it said ""for ongoing therapy"" even though there is no way it could be since this patient just had surgery (and didn't have oxycodone before per the pdmp in my state) I looked it up. Legally, the script doesn't ACTUALLY have to be for ongoing therapy, it just has to say so on the script. Good job government. Anyway, that is all well and good, but there is no supervising physician listed on this C-2 script. So I get to have someone who just had surgery bitch at me all weekend because the doctor's office is obviously closed until Monday. But they are in pain? I want them to not have pain! BUT THE PRESCRIBER CANT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS! I feel like I am forcing someone to writhe in pain because I am following the law. But, I can't break the law? That's how my worst night mare of losing my license would happen. I wanted to do an emergency supply, but I can't find any validation that is legal either because the shit script was written by a PA, not a physican...

2) MUCH MORE IMPORTANT Pt sees pcp. when pcp sends scripts, it has a list of pt's allergies on the script. I added them to her profile, duh. [some time passes] Pt gets released from hospital. Pt has a diltiazem allergy listed from her pcp. Guess what the PA at the hospital writes for? Yep. Diltiazem. Can I get ahold of the PA? Of course not. Representative for the patient came in and had no idea about the patient's allergies and said ""well, if the hospital gave it to the patient, then the patient must have gotten it in there so just fill it and we'll figure it out later.""

I documented that the patient has diltiazem listed as an allergy and I told the person picking up and they signed that they have been counseled, just to sort of cover my ass. I made it very clear that the patient (according to our records per the pcp) is allergic to this medication 

I didn't want to even give them the diltiazem with that allergy listed. I wanted to say, ""nope, not until the prescriber calls me back"" (which would be never), but I was afraid that it could be very bad for the patient if they didn't have their diltiazem. Fuck, that could be really important to life for some folks. And then who's to blame? Me.

I feel damned if I do and damned if I don't. Help guys. What would you have done in these situation?

Obviously a diltiazem allergy probably isn't real, but lets just use this as an example and talk about how you would react if you thought the allergy was real and couldn't contact the prescriber.",76,37,2018-01-07,PHARMA,0.11318787187337875,0.8572344779968262,0.029577625915408134

The data that I have found is pretty dated. I am aware that antibiotic irrigation fluids have been shown to be beneficial in reducing post operative infection rates, particularly in orthopedic cases. The data seems somewhat less meaningful when looking at the use of antibiotic irrigation fluids in addition to IV antibiotics. Since almost all of our patients receive IV antibiotic prophylaxis is there additional benefit to using antibiotic irrigation? The reason for my question is that I have an orthopedic surgeon in my OR that uses anywhere between 25 and 30 liters of antibiotic irrigation fluid per case. My facility is attached to a large teaching institution and learners are present in the OR, thus leading me to assume that there may be some additional concern for technique contributing to possible SSI. Even taking that into account though, I have never seen this much irrigation fluid used by a single surgeon in any of the other institutions that I have practiced.

medicine,How do you accept it all?,"Hi Meddit.
My experience with medicine so far has left me with a lot of consternation about the future, and it has made it downright painful for me to emotionally and intellectually commit to the career of a physician. I'm hoping to gather some personal perspectives here to help me come to terms with things, if possible. I've realized that I have a lot of thoughts that I don't feel free to express to academic mentors, residency programs (potential employers), etc, since it seems that the moment you betray a lack of motivation or an unwillingness to back the status quo, you are seen as a potential problem. So I will air these thoughts here and see what comes back to me. 

In trying to drill down into why so many docs are unhappy and burnt out, I've gathered a lot of opinions, examined a lot of specialties and practice environments, and read probably too many op-eds and books. What I've surmised is this: many caring and hard-working docs feel trapped bearing the emotional and professional responsibility of a system increasingly dictated by a combination of corporate profit motive and a brutally hierarchical work environment in which the least scrupulous physician leaders are rewarded by the system and rise to the top. I recognize that our society is capitalistic and everything is a ""business"" to a large extent, but the problem is that in medicine you spend all day making decisions that have life-and-death consequences for people, and it feels like at every turn the mandate we are taught to ""do what's best for the patient"" is challenged by an unending series of perverse incentives and entrenched practices. 

I know none of this is news to practicing attendings. What I have been amazed by though, is how often I have come up against situations that have caused me and some others around me a profound sense of moral distress, and the lack of any outward discussion by senior physicians. The term [""moral distress""](http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Fulltext/2015/03000/Moral_Distress_in_Nursing.17.aspx) is something I picked up when trying to put a name to the feeling I had in some situations. It's widespread in the nursing literature but interestingly very rare in articles by physicians. Basically it's when you feel compelled to take action that is counter to what you feel is the more moral/ethical choice. For me this is an extremely painful feeling and has felt like a gradual chipping at my soul. I've always lived my life striving to treat others how I would want to be treated and have my own family treated. This has proven to be absolutely impossible in modern medicine. It seems to me that there are too many factors working against your ability to apply your own personal ethical framework to any given clinical scenario, amounting to a surrender of your [""freedom of conscience""](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijfm/2013/587541/). Where I have ethically felt at odds with decisions/practices that many attendings and trainees seem to take for granted have ranged from individual unique situations to guidelines set forth by professional societies. I also recently read the book *Doctored: The Disillusionment of an American Physician* by Sandeep Jauhar. He is a NYC academic cardiologist and NYT columnist who was driven to depression and cynicism because he felt he sacrificed his moral compass to make a living and fit into the cardiology community.

Some examples from my own experience to bring things into focus:

* Obvious and tired examples: short, rapid-fire PCP and psych visits, resulting in rampant overprescription of side-effect-laden statins, psych meds, etc when alternative strategies should be explored. This is often to satisfy tracked metrics or patient/administrative expectations.
* A senior attending surgeon at a major academic center with a pattern of careless behavior resulting in multiple poor outcomes. In private residents confided about feeling forced to be involved in his cases despite deep discomfort with his methods and decisions of whom to operate on. It was clear that other department leaders are aware of his conduct but his practices continue unchecked. 
* Corners cut in surgical cases to save time.
* Overly aggressive use of multiple lines of chemotherapy, without appropriate discussions of goals of care (especially bad in kids)
* Treating strep throat with antibiotics- the USA appears to be the only developed nation where this is still routine, and I'm convinced it does more harm than good for our patients and society. Yet I would probably be laughed out of most training programs and attending practices if I refused to swab and prescribe. See this interesting summary: http://rebelem.com/patients-strep-throat-need-treated-antibiotics/ 
* Defensive medicine. Examples abound, but here's the most salient: I essentially ruled out EM simply because I didn't want to subject countless patients to unnecessary radiation and hospital admission because of the fear of lawsuits. But I have learned that no specialty is safe from this.
* Many NICU and PICU cases- I have yet to hear a convincing argument as to why the compassionate choice is to continue invasive care for countless babies and disabled children who will know little but suffering in their lifetimes.
* The opioid crisis. How many docs have gotten their patients hooked on opioids because they followed the herd the last 15-20 years? What happened to those who refused to buy in to the hype?
* The ORBITA trial. The consensus seems to be that interventionalists will largely continue their stenting practices, continuing to cause many complications that could be avoided.
* So many unnecessary surgeries. It took 11 years of negative RCTs for professional orthopedic societies to recommend against knee scopes for osteoarthritis, and further examples are coming down the pipeline. Other examples include the mounting evidence against the efficacy of ear tubes and tonsillectomies, the bread and butter of ENT.
* Surgeries with potential harms out of proportion to supposed benefit (harms which are minimized in counseling or patients are not routinely informed of). I invite you to read about empty nose syndrome, the FDA LASIK controversy involving chronic dry eye/corneal pain, post-vasectomy pain syndrome, as a start. Think about whether you would subject yourself or a family member to the risk of such outcomes, and if these procedures should be performed as routinely as they are. And sure, you don't need to become the specialist that performs these too cavalierly, but you might be referring your patients to them.

Obviously many of the above points can be debated and come down to a personal weighing of risk and benefit or interpretation of the literature; that isn't the point. The problem is, what happens when my personal perception of the ethics of one of these runs counter to the prevailing dogma, or the expectations of your supervisors and administrators? The answer, it seems to me, is that you have a choice: suck it up and act against your beliefs of what is best for the patients, or be labeled a troublemaker and watch your career prospects dwindle. For those who have ever struggled with these issues, I ask: how have you coped? What I am looking for is strategies for coping with a dysfunctional and distressing environment that seems to rob ethical physicians of their personal and professional agency, from those who can empathize with the way I perceive things.

**TL;DR** I feel like a career in medicine involves a state of near-constant moral distress and an erosion over time of your ability to act upon your personal sense of right and wrong and what is best for each individual patient, if it goes against the prevailing dogma or the interests of your corporate employers and third-party payers.

pharmacy,Update to ER versus IR,"TLDR; Doctor error! Though my dr kinda blamed the pharmacy. 

Thanks to those who politely responded and didn't downvote me to shit for asking a question about something I was unsure of. From your comments it is apparent that there are some things I should have explained that make a difference to pharmacy people. My mistake. I will now explain and update:

First of all I see my psychiatrist every 2 weeks. Once a month she HAND WRITES me a script for all my psych meds for the following month. I don't get refills, she doesn't e script for me. So every month I show up at the pharmacy and hand turn in my paper prescription. 

I first noticed the problem with ER and IR when we tapered me off seroquil and I stopped sleeping. So she wrote me a script for seroquil 150 for a month to help out. It did nothing. She told me to take two. Nothing. One night I accidentally grabbed a leftover bottle of seroquil 50s I had and since I am lazy I just took 3 of those. Sleep. After a couple days of back forth between the 50s and the 150s I realized the 50s were IR and the 150s were ER. 

So I called my Dr. She then told me that there was no way she would have prescribed me ER because they are rarely covered by insurance and I had been fine with IR and it was clearly a pharmacy error.

So I get off the phone with her and I begin scrolling through my pharmacy's website that lets me see all my previous scripts and I see that in the the seroquil AND the lithium have both gone back and forth between XR and IR over the past 3+ months. 

Ok. Now I adore my doctor and desperately wanted her to be right because I don't want her to have missed something or been careless or whatever. However I also really like my pharmacy (with the exception of one pharmacist) and didn't want to be a problem or crazy client and call and make accusations or ask bizarre questions. So I googled and didn't find much and then came here with my questions. 

After being directed by you guys I called my pharmacy and very politely, very calmly asked to speak with the pharmacy manager. He was incredibly nice. He told me that for seroquil the 150s ONLY come in ER (but you already knew that, you pharmacy people! ;) so it wouldn't matter what she wrote, that's what you get. With the lithium, that's a little more problematic. He brought up her hand written scripts in the screen (they scan them in) and he said as he flipped back and forth through the months he could see that some months she writes ER and others she doesn't. He said that the IR and ER can't be ""confused"". They are considered two totally separate meds in the pharmacy world. So what she wrote, I got. He also told me I can stop by the pharmacy and they can print me out a log of my lithium scripts so I can take it to her and talk to her. 

Before calling my doctor back I went down and picked up the logs. It was a little issue getting them because the poor clerk had no clue what I was talking about and the pharmacist on duty seemed to think I was possibly accusing her of wrong doing (I wasn't. I was very nice and calm and in a little daze because I really really like my doctor and really really wanted the pharmacy to be at fault) but I got what I needed and ... Sure enough- sept is ER, Oct is IR, Nov is ER, Dec is IR and Jan is IR. 

*sigh*

So I call my doctor back and explain to her my ""investigation"" and she looks back through her notes (or script carbon copies? Not sure since I wasn't there in person) and she admits that yes, that was her mistake with the lithium. (When she said she never prescribed ER, she meant for the seroquil. For the lithium she wants me on the ER. So that was my misunderstanding.) But she also said that there are checks and balances and she feels that the pharmacy should have called her with the seroquil when she didn't write ER and that's what I got cause that's all I could get. And she said she feels they definitely should have called when the lithium kept switching. 

I appreciate that she took responsibility. I really really do. I'm not sure how I feel about her feeling that the pharmacy bears blame too. Because if that's her attitude then shouldn't we be blaming me for not noticing that the pills kept changing every month? (I did notice I just figured it was different manufacturers). 

So I see her on Tuesday and we basically have to start all over again with lithium to determine which was working and what dose. And I've been really depressed and very up and down wooshey for like 2-3 months now so I went through all that for no reason. So that sucks. 

So yeah. Doctor error. Thank you pharmacy people! I really appreciate your knowledge and input. This has been a crazy learning experience for me.",19,45,2018-01-11,PHARMA,0.11935850977897644,0.8532673716545105,0.027374116703867912

I am currently doing a fellowship at a pharma company which is great, but I have always wanted to own my own pharmacy. The location is great, the patients are wonderful, and the pharmacy has been there over 100 years (the owner also owns the plot its on).

I know nothing of owning a business and would like to know what are key points I need to be aware of when talking to the owner. he gave me a price tag of around $550k plus inventory on top (I think its a steal), and would do a work to own agreement while he teaches me how it works.

medicine,Physician Burnout and missing the point.,"Just for a little background, my wife and I both work for the same hospital system. I work inpatient and she works outpatient in primary care. Recently they have been on this big kick about identifying and addressing physician burnout. Mostly through speakers and seminars that occur outside of work hours. My wife usually spends at least 5 hours per week charting from home just to catch up on paperwork. In addition to this she works late hours at least once a week.

Several weeks ago my wife with a full schedule had a patient show up almost 20 minutes late. She had 2 other patients after him checked in and one ready to be seen. This patient had no urgent need to be seen. She explained to the front office that the patient would need to reschedule as she did not have any openings and he was so late. To see him would compromise the time she needs to fully address the concerns of her other patients. The office manager made a big stink about this and explained that she should be taking walk ins and if their isn't room she should double book and make room in her schedule. She politely told the office manager to fuck off. Fast forward to this week, they are going to have a practice review meeting, which occurs during her lunch hour, the only time of the day she has to catch up on charting and care for herself, and the office manager says that they will be discussing being more accommodating for late patients. This happens before a holiday weekend where my wife was scheduled to work both days(one day extended hours at her office the other day the system wide weekend clinic hours), and she also works late on Monday. 


I guess I dont really have a question, just needed to vent. But really, how can administration be so clueless? They have unpaid after hours time to try to counsel us about physician burnout, when they are the largest factor contributing to it.

medicine,Boutique/Solo/Concierge Model,"Hi - I am an FP, who only works ER. I miss my FP training, and I am interested in starting up a micro-practice. Basically I'm looking at a boutique/concierge model. I'm talking like 100 patients or less. This would be a ""side job"" but still a legitimate practice.

My goals:
1. No office - I want to run this off my computer and my cellphone.
2. No headaches - Cash pay / automatically bill the patient, no office staff
3. Treat simple problems over the phone/skype, moderate problems in person, and send the big problems to the ER. 

Ideas:
1. I'm partner in a standalone ER (that doesn't take medicaid), so I think I could have the co-pay waved at the ER, so my patients, if needed, can go to the ER and won't be billed outside of their insurance. 
2. Drchronos for charting/eRx/ordering labs - has anyone used them? I can't find a lot of reviews online.
3. LabCorp for labs - they interface with Drchronos, and there is one on the ""nice"" side of town, meaning I would just tell the patient was is ordered, they go there, get labs done, and then the results populate into Drchronos (ideally.)
4. Outpatient radiology - we have multiple outpatient radiology clinics in our area, they are on Health Gorilla, so that the results can populate into your EMR.
5. I would do house visits as allows, it may depend on a ""tier"" system.
6. If I go on vacation, the patient could just go to the ER I work at to be seen by one of my partners.
7. The patients would pay cash for labs. I've talked to LabCorp and they are talking like $10-$15 for a CBC, like $10 for a UA and $7 for a culture (per organism.) I would just order labs and patient pay for them there. I know some models ""include"" labs, but I want no headaches, so I would charge a lower fee but pt would pay for their labs.

Questions:
1. I see a lot of these types of practices bill an annual/monthly fee. What would an appropriate amount be? I'm thinking $100/month.
2. I'm thinking a 2 tiered model, one tier being access to me via email, text, cell phone but with limited hours, and tier 2 being 24/7 access. However, that dreaded high maintenance patient gives me anxiety just thinking about them. I would try to screen them out before hand. Obviously I have to be off sometimes, so I'm wondering how to handle that. Maybe a single tier with defined off hours (11pm-7am) would be ok?
3. Can anyone recommend a lightweight, easy and efficient EMR? I only know of Drchronos, and I know it interfaces with LabCorp, and can eRx. 
4. Is it ok to expect patients to pay for labs if I charge less per month? 

Any amazing apps you know of?

However when it comes to prescribing non antibiotic alternatives to our patients for sinusitis/bronchitis, we may need to over promise aka the power of suggestion.

My new elevator spiel has been to tell the patient how the combination of mucinex DM, Allegra D, and Flonase is magical and if they used each individually it’s not the same as using all 3 together and that this will get them feeling great within 2-3 days all without having to take an antibiotic which is literally poison to cellular organisms which we also are.

Anybody else have any techniques to decrease antibiotic usage?",37,65,2018-01-14,PHARMA,0.028664138168096542,0.9283074736595154,0.04302835837006569
medicine,Struggling with career/life satisfaction and sense of identity in medicine.,"This isn’t a post about being depressed. I do not think I am depressed. Overall, I would call myself happy-ish. I guess I am doing all right. I have an amazing wife and amazing family. My bills are being paid, and I do not worry about money. Good health. Great friends. Honestly, life is pretty good.


I am a newly minted neurosurgery intern in the US of A. I matched at my home program. It was my number 1 that I have been gunning for since 1st year. I still remember the happy tears I had on match day.


I’ve been doing well with residency. Few mistakes here and there…but overall, I would say that I have been successful. My attendings remark on how well I am doing; I feel like I am much more comfortable than my co-interns. And I am getting a good amount of time in the OR.


Despite all this, I am feeling surprisingly…unsatisfied with my life.


Although I did well in medical school, it was rough on me. I didn’t go to a top 50, top 100…or even a top 150 medical school. In fact, I would say that my medical school was one of the dumpster fires of medical schools (U.S. Grad). Because of this, I had to work much harder than the average student to get a shot at neurosurgery. I put in way too many hours and think I forgot how to be a normal human being with normal human being hobbies along the way. It didn’t matter at the time because I would tell myself, “once I get neurosurgery, I will be happy.”


I am coming to find that it didn’t work out like this.


I like my work. I love the patients I work with and the conditions I treat. My co-residents are great. My attendings are malignant at times…but not more malignant than any other neurosurgery attending. And I do not mind the hours.


**There just seems to be something missing. I do not know what it is.**


Like my medical school, I do not attend a top 50 or top 100 neurosurgery residency program. I would be lying if I said that lack of “name recognition” for my program doesn’t bother me. We operate a ton and we’re much busier than the majority of the ivory tower programs…but we do not have people flying from all over the world to be operated on by us. We get a lot of the bread and butter neurosurgery cases (which I enjoy). However, we just lost one of our big teaching hospitals where we do the majority of our brain tumors because of some bull shit contract reasons that I do not fully understand. This is bothering me. I do not know if this is a “grass is always greener scenario” or if I chose the wrong residency program.



I am also coming to find that I do not want my career to define my life, which is something new to me. I used to love telling people that I wanted to be a neurosurgeon when I was older, and I fell in love with the neurosurgery culture when I was doing my sub-is as a medical student. But I do not want this to be what my life is about? If that makes any sense. I want to be a great husband and loving father. I want people to know me for how passionate I am about the hobbies I have/had outside my career. 


I understand that neurosurgery and being a physician in general is a huge life commitment, but it bums me out that this is all people talk about with me or see me as. Maybe I am being dramatic. A lot of it is mostly my fault for neglecting the other aspects of my life throughout medical school. I brought it upon myself and would like to fix it.



If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. I’m not sure why I wrote this, and I do not know what I was trying to get out of those who read it. Maybe just a “hang in there, buddy; you’re doing great” is all I am looking for. Maybe I am looking for some somebody to commiserate with. Or maybe I am trying to figure out what my problem is. I feel like I should be much happier than I already am.


In short, I am finding that the only thing in my life that is bringing me satisfaction is my career with neurosurgery…and that alone is not bringing me enough satisfaction in life.

I'm an ALS paramedic in a metropolitan area, and in my system there are few ALS resources and we're layered onto high acuity calls with the primary care crews. We're the resuscitation experts and work as the team/clinical leaders when we're there. 

On a recent night shift I was called to attend (in addition to a number of calls before and after) 3 back to back cardiac arrests, all younger than would be expected. One in their 50s and 2 in their 20s. All with children. None responded to treatment and all 3 were pronounced dead after efforts had been exhausted. Two had severely soiled airways. 

This means that over the course of a few hours I had to notify 3 different families in their homes that their loved one was dead. 

I'm having a difficult time with it, I'm sure there's many of you here who've had similar and worse days. I'm hoping to find some advice on resiliency and self care from all of this.

My program has openings for 4 PGY-1 residents.  This year, we received 45 applications.  Seven failed initial screening and were not considered further.  The reasons for failing screening were:

* Insufficient GPA.  Our cutoff is 3.0.
* Incomplete application.  We had a couple applicants whose schools couldn't get transcripts to PhorCAS on time.
* Insufficient non-curricular hours.  My state requires students to have a few hundred hours of experience being precepted by a pharmacist outside of rotations -- which means if you don't work during pharmacy school, you can't get licensed.  Several applications failed screening for this reason.

So of the 38 applications that survived initial screening, we selected 16 for on-site interviews.

Continuing the trend of recent years, women were represented well in the applicant pool.  Of the 38 applications that survived initial screening, 73% were women.  Of the 16 invitations for an onsite interview we extended, 81% were to women.
Advice to students: if you decide you want to do residency, call your school's registrar **from the airport on your way back from Midyear** and get your transcripts to sent to PhorCAS.  Don't delay -- lots of registrars' offices close for the winter holidays.

Before you take the NAPLEX and MPJE you agree to the following

&gt; I understand and agree that I am expressly prohibited at all times from selling, offering,
disclosing, copying, reproducing, transmitting, requesting, purchasing, receiving, or utilizing
without specific NABP authorization, or making available the NAPLEX including, but not limited

disclosed, copied, reproduced, transmitted, requested, purchased, received, or utilized without
specific NABP authorization, or made available any portion of the NAPLEX in any form to or from

licensure revocation by the board(s) of pharmacy. 

An applicant took a state MPJE and failed. Twice. She was obviously frustrated by this and emailed a professor from a pharmacy school in that state about specific questions and topics she remembered from the exam. That professor proceeded to contact NABP and the state board, eventually testifying against this pharmacist because she violated the nondisclosure agreement.

pharmacy,Foreign pharmacists in the USA - what's the reality?,"Hi all, I'm posting on behalf of my fiance who isn't on reddit. Basically, I am a US citizen who has been living in Chile for the past 5 years. My partner is 30 years old, graduated from a 5-year pharmacy program from the number one university in Chile and has been working as a licensed pharmacist since about 2013, I think? While I love living in Chile, ultimately our goal is to get married and relocate to the US once his green card is issued - in about 2 years or so. 

Obviously, it would be great if he could just waltz into a big chain pharmacy and get hired, but we suspect the situation is quite a bit more complicated. Thankfully marriage will give him a green card so we don't have to worry about the near-impossible process of a pharmacy sponsoring his visa. Apart from that, online research indicates that he would at least have to take the FPGEE and TOEFL (he has and scored a 104). I'm originally from Pennsylvania and from there it looks like he'll need somewhere between 500-1500 hours of internship practice. However, from there, we're having trouble finding out how the next steps will realistically play out. First of all, are these internship hours normally paid, or will I have to support us during the 6ish months it will take for him to clock them? Will pharmacies actually hire him, or will he face discrimination? Will he be paid less? Will he have to work as a pharmacy tech despite having the same education and capabilities as the pharmacist he's working alongside? Will we have to move to middle-of-nowhere Wyoming for him to find a job? Should he just start planning on being a stay-at-home dad? Lol.

Obviously there is no one answer to these questions but I'm interested in hearing input from people who have any experience, either personal or tangential, to this type of situation. Our timeline ideally puts our move to the US in about 2 years so I'm asking now to give us plenty of time to work through any roadblocks you guys might point out to us.

medicine,"Doctors - If you'd be at the start of your career, what plans would you set for yourself ?","I was talking with a friend who is a 1st year Resident and he told me that if he could turn back the time, he'd make the following changes: 

  1. **He would have made a plan** - Of course, plans aren't working out precisely, because life can get complicated and things don't work out from A to Z as you plan them ( like for example, a few points above or below can make the difference between getting into a field or getting into another field ), but even though he wouldn't **micromanage** his life, he'd still set a plan that would **serve the purpose of investing the time and the energy in a proper preparation that leads to more opportunities**.

  For example: if you're a European student and you think about moving to America, studying and taking USMLE exam in time is an advantage; if you're thinking about moving abroad to any country that speaks a foreign language, getting your language diploma in time is an advantage; if you're thinking about moving to any country in which you couldn't get on your own, but a research project/an affiliate project could get you, then doing that project in time ( as extracurricular activity ) is an advantage; 

  2. **He would have researched working conditions in different countries more seriously** - Like not only knowing superficial information such as ""In Ireland you earn the most"" and ""In Dubai you don't pay taxes"", but a lot more specific factors, such as ""How's the culture/the people there ?"" , ""What technology level is used ?"" , ""What's the lifestyle there ?"" ( yes, sometimes people get to a foreign country believing there can't be so many differences in lifestyle and then they realize they've made a 180 angle change from how they used to live )

  3. **He would have spent MORE time on studying** - Well, the general opinions on this are controversial. Some doctors consider that they have over-strained themselves ( probably these are the ones who don't make the fine difference between **pushing yourself fiercely** and **wrecking yourself** ), but others do consider that more investment in studying and getting deeper into Medicine is certainly an advantage in school, because you will have a higher mental stamina, which will get you faster to that performance of ""breathing Medicine"". 

  4. **Increasing social intelligence** - This one isn't a no-brainer, and it shows very much on physicians work performance, work environment and personal lives as well. Medical school numbs you socially, and many don't even notice this until they get out in the cold hospitals and they've got to deal with difficult people ( patients and co-workers as well ). **A professional with zero social intelligence can have a hard time**, no matter that he's making the cash, he'll still face a lot of hassle because of the lack of his social skills.",57,166,2018-01-21,PHARMA,0.034494731575250626,0.9242522716522217,0.041252948343753815

* Warfarin was named after WARF, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Fund, where it was first isolated

Brand Names:

* Premarin was originally isolated from PREgnant MARe's urINe
* Lasix was named because it apparently LASts SIX hours. I'm not sold that this is an actual origin, it sounds more like a mnemonic.
* Vicodin was named because hydrocodone is approximately six (Roman numeral VI) times stronger than CODEINE
* Flexeril and Norflex will help you flex your muscles better, as they won't be as tense.

medicine,What are your experiences with and thoughts on sharing notes with patients? Our organization is headed that way and it is kind of terrifying...,"I work in outpatient IM primary care. Our organization is getting ready to start releasing notes to patients.  

**One concern is that my notes may be misinterpreted by a patient:** Lets say that I want a patient to stop a drug in the future and I voice that in my assessment - ""I want to eventually get her off her beta blocker"". The patient reads that and stops her beta blocker because she thought thats what I wanted her to do.  This may not be something that I voice to her in the actual encounter because it's too much information and it may confuse the patient.  I want to keep my instructions to the patient as simple as possible, but the note may have some complexity to it that leads the patient astray. 


**My other concern is that the patient may be offended, upset, taken aback by some of my thoughts in my assessment.** Just a quick example, I may write  ""I think she may be misusing her benzo"" or ""he is non-compliant"". In my encounter with the patient, I may have stated this with less direct choice of words, but in my note, I want to be direct and clear and concise in order to relay my thoughts effectively.  

The big problem will be the load of patient messages and calls that we'll get(complaints, questions, feedback, etc), as well as the possibly of patients misinterpreting the note - leading to a less than optimal outcome.

Is it to prevent contamination *into* the theatre area, or to prevent contamination *from* the theatre to the rest of the hospital?

medicine,80% of the patients on my FM rotation had the same complaints with little improvements.,"I'm not sure if I'm venting here, or just looking for answers/advice.

On my FM rotation, I grew immensely frustrated by the lack of improvement seen in the majority of patients. I went into the rotation thinking FM was a possibility for me in terms of residency. After it, I couldn't tell if I just had an unlucky run of patients, or if this is how FM is.

I saw many patients that we were able to help educate on topics like diabetes, healthy weight loss, med management, etc. However, it seemed like they were far and few between the same patients we saw over and over again:

* GI pain, diarrhea, bloating. No improvement even after a GI consult. Frustrated by psych referrals.

* Chronic headaches.

* Fatigue. My god, the fatigue.

* Muscle tingling, weakness in the extremities.

* Plethora of mental health issues, largely anxiety/depression.

I felt like these patients were 80% of the workload. The worst part was absolutely none of them seemed to be improving. Many were on prescriptions that we're either not helping, or at best were barely managing the symptoms with side effects of their own. 

I left this rotation a bit dejected and defeated over what we did for these patients. Most of them walked away with no answers, and maybe a med thrown at them to try and help. 

One of my preceptors pointed me in the direction of 'functional medicine', which at a high level was very intriguing, but I quickly got the impression that it was just another movement rooted in $$$$, as evidenced by the abundance of $6,000 CME courses and everything being funded by random nutriceutical companies.

pharmacy,Physician went off on me. Advice appreciated.,"New hospital pharmacist here.  I graduated last May and work as Pharmacy Manager at a Critical Access Hospital.  We are developing our antibiotic stewardship program.  Part of my job is to monitor antibiotic prescribing in the ER.  A physician had repeatedly prescribed antibiotics for patients with laryngitis and bronchitis.  I printed off those conditions from the Sanford Guide for him (both state: antibiotics not effective and not indicated).  I was polite and professional and explained that as part of our antibiotic stewardship program I monitor antibiotics in the ER.  I said there have been a couple patients in whom antibiotics may not have been indicated (I also had the patient names).  He went off on a rant saying he didn’t cause this antibiotic resistance problem and he is the one who is gonna get sued if their cough gets worse.  He said this is all academic medicine and he practices real clinical medicine and I can have my papers back (as he shoves them at me).  He went on and on, saying he’s not gonna call the pharmacist when the patient comes back sick again... And that patients have an expectation when they come in here.  I kept saying, “I understand. That makes sense.” But he still wouldn’t stop!!!  “I saw 45 patients at my other hospital last week and 15 of them had the flu.  It’s an epidemic... I can’t have these people running around infecting everyone.”  On and on.  A nurse finally intervened with a different subject.  I said thank you and walked off.  Am I out of line to follow our antibiotic stewardship requirements?  This is literally a state requirement now and I am in charge of it at my hospital.  Maybe I’m completely wrong and too new to know these things.

However, every conversation I have had with an attending (Vascular Surgeon, Hospitalist, Radiologist) about this issue indicates that most practicing physicians staunchly believe in the nephrotoxicity of radiocontrast, to the point where imaging studies that may be indicated for patients are delayed or not performed at all.

I understand that on some level, this study is flawed as looking at AKI retrospectively fails to control for many clinical factors that physicians account for when deciding whether or not to give contrast. Do you think the data from this study and others like it is not robust enough to change your daily practice? Are many physicians simply not aware of the data?

medicine,(UK) Highly concerning court case re: UK doctor,"Uk doctors have been shocked by a ruling in the High Court against a junior doctor involved in the death of a paediatric patient.

Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba

 had just returned from maternity leave and on her first day was put on call. She was a registrar, who by all accounts was competent safe and hardworking but had been off clinical work for a year. There were supposed to be 2 doctors of her seniority working that shift, in fact it was just her. During that shift a young patient came into hospital unwell. That child deteriorated and subsequently arrested. There was a brief moment of confusion when Dr Bawa-Garba halted the cardiac arrest team, having mistaken the patient for another child who was DNR, however the mistake was realised and resuscitation attempts were re-commenced (although the court recognised that this did not have a bearing on the death).


During the court case for manslaughter it was revealed that the ward was understaffed with both nurses and doctors, that the IT system was down, meaning that results were delivered in an unusual way, and that during handover, the consultant on call had been made aware of the patient's extremely abnormal ABG, showing marked acidaemia. He later stated that because the result was not emphasised to him, he had missed its importance.

Aftre the death, as is usual in the UK, Dr Bawa-Garba met with her supervisor and composed a reflection on events - these are intended to guide one's education and personal/professional development. This reflection was placed into the doctor's electronic training portfolio. The court subsequently ordered release of this reflection, which was used against her in court, in violation of the intended use.

Dr Bawa-Garba was given a suspended jail sentence, and was also subject to discipline by the GMC (the body that issues licences to practice to UK doctors). She appeared before the MPTS - Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service- and was suspended for 12 months. The GMC appealed in court against this decision, asking for a stronger sanction.

This incident appears to have been the sole blemish on an otherwise exemplary career and training - Dr Bawa-Garba continued to work for several years after the patient death until the court case with no concerns raised.

The court allowed this appeal, thus opening Dr Bawa-Garba to more severe sanctions, and more worryingly, while acknowledging the system safety failures that occured, said that these had no bearing or relevance to the fact that a mistake was made.


This case is groundbreaking in the UK. read the article, and research the details of the case and if you are a doctor in the UK, be very afraid...

pharmacy,"Update on Residency ""Resignation""","Originally posted this around 6 months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/6r7x7z/residency_resignation/

Basically, I got many messages about what happened and where I'm at now. So just to update, I actually ended up staying with my residency program and worked through my problems by talking with my RPD who was 100% supportive of me. All of my problems were addressed and it's been such an amazing residency year yet. Residency was definitely a struggle at first. However, you figure out your strengths and weaknesses. You begin to grow and develop your skills. Time management skills are a must. And honestly, toughing it out has really helped me out to become a great pharmacist and was one of the best decisions I could have made.

 I have formed so many connections (arguably the biggest benefit with residency) and I will have a job lined up for me once I finish. People were asking for an update, but if you have any questions please feel free to let me know.

Some of the big ones I've gotten:

1 - I got a lot of questions about people who were searching for jobs and asking if it was worth it. I'm in the most saturated, urban parts of the country and I know that doing a residency helped me tremendously. If you're feeling ""stuck"" in retail and trying to get out, I absolutely would recommend going for a PGY-1. It's becoming the new standard in very populated regions. In fact, where you see ""residency training desired"" might as well read ""residency training required.""

2 - Many questions on dealing with stress. Honestly, BaconCheeseBurger put it best in my original post. This. Is. Temporary. It's CRAZY to think that half the year has flown by in an instant. Midyear was an awesome break. In addition, my struggles got better once I voiced what was going on in my life. A good residency program will support its residents. And honestly, I've rarely had to stay late at work except for a few days when I had to catch up on some interventions, P&amp;T stuff or any other miscellaneous tasks.

3 - Clinical vs. staffing. Honestly, I still love staffing. However, the sweet schedule and job roles of a clinical pharmacist are just too good to pass up for me. But doing a residency can land you either - if you figure out you want to staff, you set yourself up very  nicely for it from a hiring manager's point of view.

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if I were now the bottom of the class since everyone below me either dropped down a year or left for some reason or another.

I'm currently on a surgical rotation at a large academic center and I love it.

I went to the medical school I did because I couldn't get accepted anywhere else. And now I'm stuck, probably not able to get into a surgical residency because like the rest of my adult life I've never been good enough to have options. And if I do get into a residency somewhere it'll be because I simply wasn't good enough to get in anywhere else. And doors will always be closed to me because literally my single greatest accomplishment in med school was not shooting myself in the head. That's about the only success I've had so far.

pharmacy,How do you explain the difference between Zyrtec and Xyzal to an average patient?,"All generic Xyzal is on backorder through our wholesaler and we were completely out today. A patient arrived to pick up their prescriptions—one of which was Xyzal #30. We of course weren't able to fill it so I left the counter to grab some OTC brand-name Xyzal after the patient said that they were fine paying more than usual (without knowing the exact amount). While doing so, I noticed that the Xyzal #35 was $20.99 and the store-brand Zyrtec #30 was $9.99, so I also nabbed the Zyrtec to offer it as an alternative in case they didn't want to pay so much. I then began to explain the price difference and they of course wanted to know if it was ""the same thing"".

I understand that Zyrtec is racemic, Xyzal is enantiopure, and levocetirizine is the eutomer of cetirizine. However, I have no idea how to explain this via a layperson's vernacular. Unfortunately, the pharmacist was stuck on the phone with a patient and I was the only other employee in the pharmacy. I really struggled to explain, ""They're not technically the same thing but [Zyrtec] has the same thing as Xyzal, but—""

""So they're the same thing?"" they interrupted.

""Well, not technically. It's just partially the same thing.""

""…""

I eventually pointed to the generic names and they soon decided that Zyrtec would suffice (probably because they didn't care enough to understand the difference).",34,43,2018-01-28,PHARMA,0.07023385167121887,0.9013699293136597,0.028396299108862877
