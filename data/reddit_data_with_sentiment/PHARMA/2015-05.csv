medicine,Naïve questions about physician lifestyle(s) from a MS2 student,"Hey everyone,  
  
I am an MS2 that will soon be an MS3. I'm not too worried about Step 1, but I've began to worry/wonder a lot about my life as a physician. If you guys wouldn't mind entertaining them, I have a few questions about life as a physician. As I mentioned, I don't have a lot of clinical experience yet, so please excuse my naïvety. 
   
I don't want to work the hours that your average doctor does. I am willing to put in 80 hrs/week to get the best training possible, but after residency/fellowship I want to work a little less than your average doctor and have a better ""home life."" I'd be much happier making $150-200k per year at 50 hours per week than $250k at 60-65 hours per week. I don't want to be on call because I have a lot of trouble sleeping as it is. For the record, ""on call"" to me means being called into the hospital once I'm already home or being called in the middle of the night. Aside from emergencies, I want to leave the hospital/office and be left the hell alone once I'm home. I want to have days off where I just sit in my backyard and read a book, play with my dog/kids, hang out with the wife, have hobbies, etc.  
   
For these reasons, I am leaning towards doing Emergency Medicine or Internal Medicine (hospitalist), since they are shift work, but I REALLY like Heme/Onc and I am considering that as well, as I am smart/determined enough for that fellowship.  
   
1) Is this even plausible? I absolutely do not want to run my own practice – it's just hassles that I do not wish to deal with. Can I tell a hospital that I want to work less hours and thus accept a lower salary than my peers? If I were private practice, I'd imagine I could just see less patients and only work 40-50 hours per week.   
  
2) Is Heme/Onc a good fit for someone who does not wish to work more than 50 hours per week and wants to be on call as little as humanly possible? My research has shown that the average Heme/Heme-Onc doctor works 57 hours per week excluding on-call time...that's a little too much for my lifestyle. But again, I'd be fine taking a bit less money so I could work less.   
   
3) Can I instead negotiate more vacation time? Maybe 50 hours/week with 6-8 weeks vacation instead of 45 hours/week with 4-6 weeks vacation.      
    
In any case, I would greatly appreciate some feedback. Please feel free to be blunt and tell me I don't know anything about how hospitals/offices work, as long as it's constructive. I understand that my specialty interest may change once I do rotations, but I do not think my lifestyle desires will.",81,26,2015-05-02,PHARMA,0.06652243435382843,0.9037067294120789,0.029770860448479652

medicine,"Is reducing inflammation in gum disease good enough?

If I could reduce that immune response it would prevent the damaging effects. If the gum disease was caused entirely by an OVER reactive immune system (much like acne) that would solve the problem.

Starting from radiology reports: his first CXR was negative. He then had a protable performed in the ward which showed the probable upper right lobe PNA.

Another CXR was performed which showed extensive multilobar PNA. He was started on cefepime and vancomycin IV with continued supportive therapies. Over the course of this abx therapy, his fever remained 101-102 and his sats improved slightly up to 93%. New CBC was ordered:

Rapid HIV-Ab was non reactive. New CXR showed improvement but multilobar opacities remained. Pt was given avelox, doxy, and amoxicillin oral. Pt continued to improve and his vitals normalized. He was monitored again over night and a final CBC was ordered which all values were WNL. He was then discharged with continued supportive tx and incentive spirometer.

You might remember that his original complaint was vomiting of blood and nausea with mediastinum px. He had no witnessed emesis during inpatient status for 5 days. He did continue to complain of nausea and indigestion throughout his stay.

So that's it. Pneumonia. No cannabinoid toxicity or GI tear requiring emergency scope as some suggested. Pretty big take away for me was how quickly this progressed from having a clear CXR on monday to extensive, multilobar PNA despite IV abx and inpatient status on Wednesday. I do lean towards the possibilty of aspiration of vomitus causing his PNA, though.

Thanks for the discourse during the previous post! I appreciate all of the input. I will try to answer any questions I can, but remember I did not care for him while he was in the ward.

pharmacy,What did you learn this week?,"**Sore throat**  

For patients coming in with a sore throat, I always recommend Cepacol lozenges or the generic equivalent. Seems obivous, but never occurred to me to recommend ice or ice chips to help sooth it as well.  
  
I also usually ask them, ""Have you seen a doctor yet? Sometimes sore throat can be caused by strep and you might need to be on antibiotics"" but that is the extent of it. I'm going to add a bit of differential diagnosis to this.  ""How fast did it come on?"" and ""What other symptoms are you having?"" are good questions. If it came on suddenly and they have fever, it is more likely to be strep. If they have swollen glands and/or headache, they should be referred to a doctor.  
  
**Constipation in an infant**  

Corn syrup / Karo syrup is an old home remedy, but modern corn syrup probably doesn't work. First thing to try is adding water or fruit juice in between feedings. If they eat solid foods, you can try adding pureed pears or prunes. If the baby is 6 months old or older, the doctor might prescribe an osmotic laxative like Polyethylene glycol (Miralax) or lactulose. Mineral oil, stimulant laxatives, and enemas are not recommended.  
  
**Fridge items**  

Gabapentin solution is an item you might not expect to find in the refrigerator. I see this prescribed to pets sometimes and an important point to keep in mind is that Xylitol is poisonous to them. The product made by Hi-Tech contains it, but the Amneal version is safe.  
  
FIRST®- Omeprazole Compounding Kit is now kept in the refrigerator BEFORE compounding. Blew my other pharmacist's mind when I told him. ""You mean, after you mix it?"" ""No, before"" Whaaa...

medicine,Covering for someone else's maternity leave,"Inspired by the other post obviously.   The following is a blurb about me which you can skip and just go straight to the questions: I'm a female, US, non-trad student, who will be 36 by the time I finish residency at the very earliest (assuming I do a 3 year residency and nothing goes horribly wrong) meaning I might have a job by 36 and then need to wait a year to have FMLA kick in so I'd start having kids at 37 if I waited. To me, that's no bueno b/c if I have fertility issues but it's not discovered until I'm 37 then I might be screwed, plus other reasons I don't want to wait until 37 but that's probably enough blathering from me.

I don't think the world should have to accommodate my life choices but I don't think my life choices should have to accommodate the rest of the world. My husband selfishly refuses to have a baboon's uterus implanted in his abdomen so unfortunately that leaves it up to me.  I'd like to strike a balance with the world and would like some guidance.

1) This might be a dumb question, but if the mom uses her elective rotation as maternity leave, does that still impact her fellow residents?  

2) If a male resident takes vacation, the rest of the residents need to cover for him, but the beef here is that maternity leave is longer than vacation, and thus more of an inconvenience, is that correct?

3)  If a woman waits until she is an attending, she is still inconveniencing her colleagues correct? But it's worse in residency b/c   residency is more demanding/stressful, right?

4) Is there a way a woman can take on more duty before she gets pregnant, thereby compensating for when her colleages need to cover for her? 

5) When I interview for residencies, I'm planning on revealing that pregnancy is a possibility during my residency, maybe not during the formal interview- maybe during the meal with residents if that's part of the interview day? I know this sounds like a terrible idea but honestly since I'm a woman, they will probably make that assumption so  I'm not really revealing some giant secret, right?

6) Follow up  to #5-  I want to be staightforward bc if there's a fellow woman who is also planning on kids, then we might be able to time it so that we both aren't out on maternity leave at the same time. Plus if a residency is going to be openly hostile to me getting pregnant, that's something I'd rather know up front.

7) I'm hoping I can get a month of maternity leave, which seems reasonable/possible based on programs I've looked at but I'm wondering how advertised vs reality plays out.

8) How much work do you miss before you have to make it up/extend your residency? E.g. if a resident was in a terrible MVA and it took him 10 weeks before he could return to work, would he have to make up some of those weeks?

As an MS2 I obviously haven't picked my specialty yet but I've been told I'm very 'medicine' (vs surgery) and I'm interested in EM.

Thanks!

medicine,Hospice care may be more expensive - is that a bad thing?,"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1408705  
  
This article says that hospice patient's ended up costing Medicare $10,191 while only saving $3,430, resulting in a net increased cost of $6,761.  First of all it seems hard to believe.  A lot of the people in the non-hospice group were DNR and Do-Not-Hospitalize so they probably should have been on hospice anyway.  In fact I bet a big part of why they weren't is that hospice is criminally underfunded.  
  
Even if we believe these numbers though, why would it be bad?  Care for old demented and dying people should focus on their comfort.  Paying for grief counseling for the family, increased comfort medications, supervision, etc seems like money at least well spent, even if it is $10K.  Spending $3-4K to put them in an ambulance, send them to the ER and then ICU and poke them full of holes only to jump on the chest and tube them seems like money wasted, even if it is somehow less money than the first group.  
  
I am glad that we are spending more money on hospice.  Hospice patients and their families deserve all the respect in the world, $7K seems like a reasonable amount of support from the government for this.  They spend way more money on worse things.  
  
Lastly the article complains that people are spending too long on hospice.  ""In our unmatched cohorts, the mean 
hospice length of stay increased from 72.1 days 
in 2004 to 92.6 days in 2009. This increase is 
largely due to the growth in the number of nursing home hospice residents without cancer (who 
have less accurate 6-month prognoses""  Am I wrong or is the average hospice stay supposed to be 6 months?

medicine,"After witnessing this, I want to personally castrate/spay every child abuser in existence.","So a few days ago, I was reaching the end of my 12 hr shift, on a pretty busy work day. I hadn't gotten any sleep on shift, so I was pretty much a zombie. All I wanted to do was to sneak into the ICU, and sleep on the floor next to some coma patient who wouldn't notice me.

I was just about to finish my shift when EMS radioed in saying that they were transporting an arresting, asystolic 3/yo female, no known medical conditions/disorders, to the ER. CPR was underway, and we were going to need a surgery team ASAP. This was a little weird to me, because usually, if they don't have any medical issues, three-year-olds' hearts don't just stop out of the blue.

So anyway, EMS raced this little kid in on a stretcher into the ER. She was *tiny,* smaller than most normal kids her age. She was unmoving, and the medics were performing CPR one-handed on her. She was completely in the nude, and when I came a little closer, what I saw was horrific.

The kid was COVERED in bruises and long open stab wounds. EMS had tried to bandage them, but they were leaking blood so much that it hadn't helped much. The scene was so horrific that one of our med students actually raced out of the room in panic.

A nurse took over CPR, and I called out for a couple units of blood, and for a team of surgeons to race down here. By this point in time, the kid was asystolic. We gave her some epi, though we didn't think it would do much.

Then, I swear to God, a miracle happened. The heart monitor changed from a flatline to a VF rhythm. We were all going WTF just happened here, because this shit doesn't happen all the time. 

A nurse shocked the kid twice, bringing back the heart rhythm. This in itself was a miracle, but there was little time to celebrate. The surgery team arrived, and they clamped a few bleeding arteries, inserted a chest tube after her lung collapsed in front of them, and stitched her up.

The kid, it turns out, was being raised by her crackhead parents who honestly didn't give a shit about her. The night she was brought in to us, she had wet the bed, and her parents decided to punish her BY BEATING AND STABBING HER UNTIL HER HEART STOPPED. Then, the dad, feeling guilty, called 911, and EMS got her to us.

The girl is currently in the ICU, and is expected to survive (yay!). The demon spawn that are her parents have been arrested, and rumor has it that they are victims of police brutality. I don't blame the cops for that. Hell, if I'd met them personally, I'd probably have killed them myself for what they did to their daughter. People like that don't deserve to be parents.

[UPDATE] (http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/35klrv/why_did_this_have_to_happen/) : So all of this happened ~5 days ago. Today, I went up to the ICU to check on this kid, because so many people were affected by her death, not only at the ER, but also here, on Reddit. And I cleared up a few things, namely, when I said the girl was expected to survive, I meant that her chance of survival was about 40%, miraculously high compared to earlier. 

Unfortunately, like so many others like her, that little girl joined the majority of that statistic.

First up, I just want to say that we tried to save her, all of us. The paramedics raced to the scene, and even before the police came there, they picked up the little girl, breaking the rules and pushing the parents aside. In the ambulance, they performed CPR, intubated her, and started an IV line. In the ER, we did our best. We brought her back from an asystolic state to VF. We shocked her back to a sinus rhythm. We staunched as much blood flow as we could.

The surgeons operated on this little girl right there in the ER. They took her to the ICU, where she received round-the-clock care and assistance. She was given morphine in order for everything to be as painless as possible.

Sadly, that wasn't enough. The damage her bastard parents did to her was too great, and late last night, she succumbed to her injuries. In the moments before she died, she was minimally conscious. One of the nurses in the ICU held her hand as she became unconscious.

I'm typing this at 3am just because this is how I vent out my frustrations. This is how I hold myself together. This is how I stay in my job, striving through each day. Writing is how I do these things.

I'm going to her funeral on Thursday. I'll pay my respects, along with other members of the hospital staff, EMS crew, police officers, total strangers to this girl, and CPS workers. Nobody else will be there, not even an auntie, or a grandma. This just shows you how much this little girl was neglected. Not many people cared for her. And it was only in her last moments that anyone showed some sympathy towards her.

But I shouldn't be going to her funeral. I shouldn't be lighting a candle in her memory, or keeping vigil around her coffin. I should not even know her at all. If someone told authorities what was going on in this little girl's home, her life would have been saved. And people noticed, but they didn't tell. And none of them are or should be going to her funeral.

So all of this happened ~5 days ago. Today, I went up to the ICU to check on this kid, because so many people were affected by her death, not only at the ER, but also here, on Reddit. And I cleared up a few things, namely, when I said the girl was expected to survive, I meant that her chance of survival was about 40%, miraculously high compared to earlier. 

Unfortunately, like so many others like her, that little girl joined the majority of that statistic.

First up, I just want to say that we tried to save her, all of us. The paramedics raced to the scene, and even before the police came there, they picked up the little girl, breaking the rules and pushing the parents aside. In the ambulance, they performed CPR, intubated her, and started an IV line. In the ER, we did our best. We brought her back from an asystolic state to VF. We shocked her back to a sinus rhythm. We staunched as much blood flow as we could.

The surgeons operated on this little girl right there in the ER. They took her to the ICU, where she received round-the-clock care and assistance. She was given morphine in order for everything to be as painless as possible.

Sadly, that wasn't enough. The damage her bastard parents did to her was too great, and late last night, she succumbed to her injuries. In the moments before she died, she was minimally conscious. One of the nurses in the ICU held her hand as she became unconscious.

[SB 538 text](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB538)

The bill recently passed the Senate Committee on Business, Professions, and Economic Development with a vote of 7-2.

The bill was scheduled to be heard by the Senate Appropriations Committee on May 11, but was postponed until May 18. This is a good chance to kill this bill.

Please contact the following Senators who sit on the Appropriations Committee:

* [Senator Ricardo Lara (Chair)](http://senate.ca.gov/sd33)
* [Senator Patricia Bates (Vice Chair)](http://senate.ca.gov/sd36)
* [Senator Jim Beall](http://senate.ca.gov/sd15)
* [Senator Jerry Hill](http://senate.ca.gov/sd13)
* [Senator Connie Leyva](http://senate.ca.gov/sd20)
* [Senator Tony Mendoza](http://senate.ca.gov/sd32)
* [Senator Jim Nielsen](http://senate.ca.gov/sd04)

SB538 is sponsored by [Senator Marty Block](http://sd39.senate.ca.gov/), so you should also urge him to withdraw his support.

SB538 is also supported by the [California AARP](http://states.aarp.org/contact-aarp-california/), so you may want to let them know that naturopathic medicine can seriously harm senior citizens.

Please take action! 

Failure of this bill would be a huge success for the medical community, as naturopaths use legislative successes in big states to promote their pseudoscience in other states and at the federal level.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

****UPDATE: SB538 appearance in the Senate Appropriations Committee was cancelled by its author! I am not sure if this means he is withdrawing the bill, but it seems like a good sign that this bill is on the out.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

~~****UPDATE: SB538 appears to be suspended by rule 62(a). I suppose this really means this bill is on the way out. Does anyone know what this means? Thank you to everyone who contacted senators!!!~~

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

~~****UPDATE: (26-May-2015) SB538 seems to have gone back to the Senate Business, Professions, and Economic Development Committee, where it passed 5-2, as on 28-April. Not sure what this means. Anyone have ideas?~~

pharmacy,I'd like to say something positive for once.,"The last couple time I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/2u0gj1/clearing_your_queue/) on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/2tfzeg/navigating_work_politicsprofessional_advice/), it was to complain about my position as a new grad and navigating a poorly run store. Sadly to say, my store is still in pretty bad shape. This past Friday, my morning partner was left by herself after 5PM (meaning I also had no tech help either 10pm-8am) and I was by myself 8pm-8am this past Saturday picking up after a floater who is notorious for being less than swift when it comes to completing his duties (seriously, he completed 178 scripts with tech help and I did 232 with no help on top of doing the CII counts).  

That being said I'm still glad that I chose to be a pharmacist and I do see myself sticking with retail for a long while. My yearly review ended with a 5% raise and if my partners are telling me the truth I got the highest out of all them. I'm easily going to make $120k this year. Even after taxes and paying off my loans (which will be done in about 3-4 years) I live very well. I'm 24 and the most financially successful out of my friends (which includes engineers) and I work a 1 week on/1 week off schedule. I basically have vacation every other week and though working every other weekend can be hard I still have plenty of time to devote to my social life and get paid out my vacation time if I don't use it. I have a 401k that is matched 5%, decent health/eye/dental insurance, and my schedule allows me to take care of my dog with little help or burden on my roommates. 

A lot of the positives I mention are related to money and though many people say money doesn't buy happiness, it sure isn't bringing me any grief. The weeks I'm particularly stressed out I just go get a massage or treat myself to a nice dinner. When I want to go out and do something I can make sure none of my friends get left behind. If a friend of mine has troubles, I can often assist them either because I have the free time to be there for them or I can bail them out. I just wanted to say this because the negativity on this subreddit can be overwhelming sometimes and I'm definitely guilty of contributing to that. Still, I believe there are positives to this job and the lifestyle we choose.",15,46,2015-05-13,PHARMA,0.04766632243990898,0.904501736164093,0.047831904143095016
pharmacy,Why are customers so nasty?,"Dear Pharmacists and Pharm Techs,

I am a regular customer at Walgreens. I've been regularly filling my prescriptions for about four or five years now. I am 25. The lines are always long and it is always because of a nasty, rude ass customer. One by one, a customer steps up to the counter (or pulls up in the drive through) and becomes a MONSTER. this is so regular, I see it EVERY TIME I FILL MY PRESCRIPTIONS. I always wonder why, because I can't hear everything that's going on. I love my pharmacy and the folks who work in it. They are all beyond helpful. They go out of their way to make my experience a pleasant one and I even have a prescription for a controlled substance(xanax, 15 a month). I am in and out in 20 min.  I mention that because my aunt told me all pharmacies give you shit over controlled drugs but I've literally never, not once had that experience so I find it hard to believe the pharmacy is just giving people a hard time because the drugs are controlled. One of my prescriptions is and I've never heard a peep about it from a tech or pharmacist. 

It's bad. I'm probably preaching to the choir because you guys experience it but I mean, it's so bad that I actually buy my pharmacy staff candy before I pick up my prescriptions because I feel so sad for them. I get them a big card on popular holidays and I go out of my way to thank them for being so great because people are just awful. But why? What's going on? I can't hear the conversations and I really wish I could because sometimes I feel compelled to step in for you guys. :( it's plain old bullying is what it is and I don't get why it's happening.

pharmacy,Stress.,"So obviously, we all know that working in the Pharmacy field is highly stressful, but here's my question, which part is most stressful? I'm curious what everyone thinks is the single most stressful factor in our field. And I'm looking for as much specificity and detail as possible. And if you have a tip on how to deal with someone else's stress, please share.



I'll start. I think the most stressful part of my pharmacy is the fact that our pharmacy manager (he) and full time hourly staff pharmacist (she) hate each other. He's 31 and she's 43, he's a PharmD and she's an RPh. They can't stand each other, both refuse to talk to the other in a professional manner. We were supposed to start an immunization program about 6 months ago but both were too bull headed to tell the other when they got their immunization licenses because both didn't want to be the first one to get it and therefore have to do all the immunizations. He's afraid to report her errors because he's paranoid she'll report every single microscopic fault he makes, and she probably would. She's a passive aggressive bitch who wants all of the rights and privileges of being in charge, but none of the responsibility. The overall environment when they work together is like being at dinner with your divorced parents. And I, nor anyone else I work with, knows how to fix it except to get rid of her, which seems impossible. We all really like him, but we're afraid if he doesn't stand up to her, there will be major problems.",24,19,2015-05-13,PHARMA,0.12931445240974426,0.8480404019355774,0.022645119577646255

I've tried to gently and respectfully educate this doctor regarding best practice, current wound care literature, etc. I presented it as an opportunity to BE educated, assuming he had reasons for this treatment approach. He was livid, and I was reprimanded by my manager for questioning this physician for fear we would lose referrals. Still, i feel SO uncomfortable with these betadine whirlpools. The whirlpool itself is far from sterile, there is no protocol in place for the appropriate dilution of betadine, and I don't have the support of my department to purchase more appropriate equipment. I'm wondering: do any of you order betadine whirlpools to treat infected wounds? If so, what is your rationale? I was taught this approach is antiquated and not best practice due to risk of periwound maceration, potential cytotoxicity of betadine at certain concentrations, and potential contamination from the whirlpool itself. I'm just trying to understand why this doctor is so unwilling to budge on the issue.

medicine,Reddit. The hospital admin decided to lecture me on what I did. What do you guys think about my attitude?,"I work occasionally the clinic shift at the local hospital. It's a medium sized town that lack some resources, especially during the night and weekends.

So this teenager' 13 y/o, Perviously healthy had a seizure at home. Brought in by his parents, who told me out was his first time. The seizure was generalized of the tonic kind. He arrived very sleepy' a little confused and with moderate headache. No fever. No trauma, no intoxication suspected. No drug abuse suspected. The patient was at home with his dad the whole day.

After physical exam I decided: your son is going to do a CT of the head. Hopefully nothing like hemorrhage or tumors will show.

I proceed to order the exam and call rx for preparations.

A few minutes later admin comes and tell me no CT available. That I shouldn't have ordered it. I had a very professional discussion with this nurse and then she managed to transfer the kid to a larger hospital.

Then came today. Medical admin came to me at the beginning of shift to tell me I shouldn't tell patients that the hospital does not have the resources to resolve their cases. He gave me no more options but it looked like he was telling me I shouldn't have asked the CT or tried to admit the patient for a few days until CT available. 

Simply put, he asked me to stall the patient that was already admitted and dismiss him so the family could search another hospital.

How would you proceed?

Edit - I'd like to thank the reddit community for the brave words and thoughtful discussion. I'm practicing a below acceptable medicine according to first world standards here in Brazil. These events are fery frequent here and a medium sized city like mine does not have a lawsuit culture, so I don't think things will improve anytime soon.

I just ended another shift at this hospital and fortunately all went fine.

We have an aux sticker that goes on the bottle that says ""DO NOT REFRIGERATE"" but the sticker was put on the box instead of the bottle and the parents took the bottle home and threw it straight in the fridge.  
  
They called this morning and I asked the mother to inspect the product. Is it still an even looking suspension? Anything noticeably off about it? Nothing out of the ordinary, per her report. Package insert just says to store it at room temp. Most drugs are more stable refrigerated than at room temp, so one might assume ...  
   
But we are pharmacists and we do not like to assume. So I called the manufacturer and asked them if product stored in the fridge was usable. They provided me with the useless non-answer, ""We have no stability data"". I had the Dr. approve a refill and tried to call the insurance, who refused to pay for it. Mom was willing to pay out of pocket.

medicine,Question about beta blockers and complete heart block,"Will a beta blocker effect the heart rate of someone who is in complete heart block (that isn't due to medication).

Had a patient yesterday who was in complete heart block (HR of 14 - pacer was floated through her femoral as we waited to get a permanent placed). I noticed on her home meds she takes atenolol, but while she was here her BP was running high (systolic of 180).

We were using hydralazine for BP control PRN and holding off on the beta blockers to make sure this wasn't an issue caused by them (which it ended up not being).

That being said, I was just curious if a person is in completely heart block that isn't caused by medication, would a beta blocker still slow the HR down, or will it not really have an effect since the atria aren't ''talking'' with the ventricles anyway. I know beta receptors are located on the heart, I'm just not sure if they are solely on the atria and effect the SA node, or if they are located throughout where a beta blocker hits all aspects of the heart (SA, AV, ect)",7,19,2015-05-20,PHARMA,0.041397616267204285,0.9255451560020447,0.03305720537900925

So do I have this right:

- So no CCBs or digoxin in any patients with WPW syndrome.

- Beta-blockers okay in orthodromic AVRT but not antidromic AVRT.

- No CCBs, beta-blockers, adenosine, digoxin, or amiodarone in those with a. fibb as well.

medicine,"Some days you get to feel like you made a difference. Then, there are days like these...","We had a mid 80’s year old patient come into our ER in acute respiratory distress. The transporting paramedic told me she had transported this patient multiple times, however this was the first time for a respiratory complaint. Upon EMS arrival on scene, patient had been found satting low 60’s on home oxygen, 5LPM NC which the patient reportedly usually did well on for chronic COPD. EMS placed patient on an NRB, and pt was able to maintain sats for the short duration of the transport without complications, airway was non-occluded, lung sounds were mostly clear bilaterally all lobes, respirations were fast and somewhat labored.

Patient was alert and oriented upon arrival, pt was placed into one of our resus rooms. Patient was initially doing well on the NRB satting mid 90’s and having decreased work of breathing from the time of EMS’s first contact. EKG was RBBB with other ectopy, but no indication of acute MI, and was unchanged from several previous EKGs months prior. Peripheral IV access was established and full rainbow blood work drawn. Lung sounds were still clear, and work of breathing had decreased to a mostly normal effort, though patient was still mildly tachypneic. It was decided to pilot pt on 6LPM via NC as questions were raised if the possible cause for initial hypoxia was a problem or interruption of the home oxygen supply. Patient initially did well.

Patient had a history of frequent ER visits &gt;15, and multiple &gt;5 brief to moderate length admissions to general/intermediate care floors in the last year, mostly for chronic idiopathic abdominal pain, and the other usuals of geriatrics; UTI’s a fall etc.

Due to the patients frequent past admissions, there was ample opportunity for the patient and family to create advanced directives, and at the time of the patients arrival in our ER the patient was DNR/DNI with proper paperwork on file, as per the patients wishes.

I had gone to other parts of the ER to intake another ambulance, and walking back to resus heard a critical desat alarm going off. The patient had been placed back on the NRB by the nurse after the home oxygen trial had failed to maintain adequate sats, but despite the NRB the patient had continued to desat and was now back in the 60’s. During this time, the patients son had arrived, and the blood work had begun to be resulted, VBG was mostly normal with a slight elevation in bicarb, CBC was unremarkable, NT-proBNP &lt;1800, potassium was low at ~2.5, but otherwise mostly normal BMP, However trop was elevated at 0.4, and most likely unsurprisingly to most of you reading this d-dimer was elevated at 2.5.

I want to be unequivocal in the next two paragraphs.

The patient had not been very verbose at any point, and had while they had answered orientation questions adequately upon arrival, the patient had been unable or unwilling to fully give verbal descriptions of symptoms, and had shown a degree of confusion, and per family may of also had a degree of dementia or cognitive decline, though nothing formally diagnosed.

The patient was still conscious, but was wholly concentrated on breathing, in the trance of hypoxia and single minded will to just get the next breath in, as I’m sure most of you have seen.

However, the way the next events played out are the reason for this post, and something that will stay with me for a long time.

The attending was doing their best to explain to the son, who was enumerated power of attorney, the options, and ramifications of those options, but it was clear that the patient was rapidly deteriorating. Of course, the son, being afraid, not being medically trained, and being put into an impossible position rescinded the DNR and DNI. 

The room was suddenly full of people. RSI drugs were prepared, additional venous access was gained, dosages were being called out and repeated back, bags were spiked, vitals were being called out, tube and blade sizes requested, vent settings being prepped, 

At the final moments, the cursory and watered down explanation of the procedure was given to the patient who was taken for granted to not know or care what was going on.

Through the noise and activity, and the hiss of oxygen in the NRB, and someone calling for a BVM I distinctly heard a quavering voice repeating one word:

“No.” 

I want to believe the patient was hypoxic enough to be past the point of knowing or caring. That they were just reflexively protesting, as I've seen dozens of hypoxia patients do.

But after it was, in plain english, put to them what was about to happen I saw a flicker of recognition. 

And I heard the plea to not do it. 

The intubation and central line went reasonable well. 

However, the patient continued to become increasingly hemodynamically unstable. A CT angio unsurprisingly showed multiple *and* bilateral pulmonary emboli.

All I can think is how sad and fucked up it is that in their last conscious moments on earth, they had to beg us not to intubate them, possibly the realization and terror of knowing they are unable to adequately communicate their protest to stop it from happening, the helplessness, the fear, the uncertainty, the burning in their arm from the induction, then, oblivion.

The patient was never stable enough to be taken off the vent. Family eventually reinstated a DNR and the patient passed.

*Some minor details changed to protect identities.*

*Edit* 

To clarify some of the legal aspects, the patient had also stated in their advanced directives that the son was allowed to make medical decisions if they were unable. Which includes up to rescinding DNR/DNI orders, unless otherwise specified, which it wasn't.

There is a question if the patient was actually incapable of making decisions at the time of the RSI, but as others have correctly pointed out, the way American systems are structured it is far more difficult to do nothing, than to do everything.

As for if the option should have even been presented to the family...",38,108,2015-05-26,PHARMA,0.10732683911919594,0.8640658557415009,0.028607347048819065

pharmacy,Hi r/pharmacy! I wrote an essay for a humanism award a couple of years ago about being an overnight pharmacist. Thought I'd share...,"3:00 AM. Where had the time gone? I was halfway into my third consecutive overnight frantically trying to complete the to-do list before my shift ended. Despite my racing thoughts, my body moved as if it was suspended in molasses. Ten hours may seem like enough time to fill the next day’s prescriptions, file paperwork, unpack and stock thousands of medication bottles, count the CII cabinet, follow up on fifty rejected claims, and take out the trash. (I assure you that it is not.) Late hours draw in eccentric people with equally eccentric stories. Take, for example, the sheepish man who limped in awkwardly complaining of priapism after taking erectile dysfunction medication; or the asymptomatic woman who convinced herself she had swine flu and begged for antivirals without a prescription. They were good natured people caught in times of distress and I was happy to assist them. I cringed, however, when drug abusers interrupted my workflow with fraudulent prescriptions or ridiculous demands. That night, a young woman stumbled into the pharmacy exhibiting telltale signs of narcotic abuse: slurred speech, trembling hands, and bloodshot eyes. She asked to fill her clonazepam one week early and wanted to pay out-of-pocket. Just as I was about to deny her request, the thought of my late grandfather suddenly crossed my mind.

*I hesitated... as she glared at me.*

In my short time as a pharmacist, I have concluded that most people are dissatisfied with their healthcare. They complain of disillusioned healthcare professionals reluctant to make any efforts beyond the examination room. Patients feel buried under layers of contrived bureaucracy without communication from their providers. Ironically, medicine is built upon the notion of relationships: man requires the aid of another. Doctors exist for the sake of other men. There is no other profession that embodies such altruistic ideals so clearly, yet we have strayed from our roots. Had I been confronted about my conceited detachment that night, I would have blamed external factors. The insurance company was at fault for adopting officious protocols to cut costs; the government, for being ambiguous about what is considered ‘professional judgment’; society, for being overly litigious; and management, for having unreasonable expectations. I would have echoed the same grievances that healthcare workers have voiced for decades. If the intelligent minds before me could not heal the ill-practiced practice of medicine, what chance did I have?

*“Call my doctor. He’ll clarify everything.” I glanced quizzically at her as I wondered which doctor would respond to a page about authorizing refills at this hour. “Please find it in yourself to help me,” she begged.*

Her pleas triggered a meaningful realization: the cynicism epidemic is not just due to external forces. Rather, this behavior is the result of an internal struggle some providers face without resolution, replicated millions of times. If we could resolve the inner conflict between convenience and moral responsibility, the work-shift attitude would disappear. That night, I found a way to cope with my internal battles – I pretended she was my grandfather. Her concerns became my concerns. I was willing to do anything in my power to help her because I had a personal stake in her welfare. She reciprocated by understanding my limitations as an inundated pharmacist. Such a simple mental computation fostered a profound sense of mutual respect and interdependence.

*To my surprise, her physician responded. I learned that she was being treated for alcohol withdrawal. She was filling her prescription early because her physician had increased the dosage. I shuddered at the thought of her seizing due to my insensitivity.*

Medicine is simply humanism manifesting itself in the form of scientific approach to illness. “Treat the individual not the disease,” is an age-old adage capturing one of the basic tenets of medicine and by extension, humanism. The central idea is that each patient is a sovereign entity capable of deviating from the expected norm. By adhering to this principle, each patient interaction becomes personal and not preordained. I project my grandfather onto each of my patients to remind myself to act in accordance. I have since become a better healthcare professional, and more importantly, a better person. As H.J. Blackham wrote, “human life is in human hands.” Thus, we are all susceptible to our own limitations. No simple solution exists for coping with the daily frustrations inherent in medicine and my method will not work for everyone. Yet, I remain confident in the medical community’s capacity for personal growth. I invite you to become more humanistic, to help improve medicine, and provide better outcomes for our patients.",9,60,2015-05-28,PHARMA,0.07158499350771308,0.7480062544345856,0.18040874786674976

pharmacy,Test Strips.,"I've posted on here before ranting about how big pharmacy chains are killing the profession and how awful it is working there.

Holidays are awful. Great we have a day off but we spend a week catching up. Yesterday was particularly awful. One of those ""everything went wrong"" and my doc line was ringing off the hook. And then there was her....

She just came from a dermatology appointment where she was told that psoriasis covers a majority of her body now. Her MD told her to reduce stress in her life. Her internist put her on a ""prodigy"" testing meter which isn't that common. Her test strips and lancets were at a store in Florida (snow bird) but I couldn't transfer them because of Medicare B. The doc sent new prescriptions to express scripts mail order upon which she was informed they couldn't fill them through Medicare B since they can't be mailed. 

I called the office and asked for a new meter, strips, and lancets. The prescriptions were sent to Florida. Called back and had them sent to me. No diagnosis code. Called again. Then they never sent the lancets. 

Finally after 6 hours, countless phone calls, and begging the receptionist to take my call and not transfer me to the voicemail line. She was able to pick up a new meter, strips, and lancets and hopefully able to reduce a little stress in her life.

Well, the last time other pharmacy went to fill for him they found insurance information in their computer system for him and billed it so when we went to Bill his insurance like usual it popped up too soon. Called other pharmacy to ask if they could put it back, but apparently I called them after they had gotten off the phone with the patient's doctor to see why he was filling so frequently and now his doctor is requiring him to go to only one pharmacy so that he can't be filling multiple scripts, crushing it up, and snorting it.

pharmacy,Pharmacist gave us twice the number of Hydrocodone tablets prescribed.,"We are 24/7 caregivers for a parent with dementia, who lives with us for this purpose. We handle all of her needs, including making sure she receives meds on time. Since she takes a lot of meds (she is 84), we use a weekly medicine box with slots for 4 times a day.

Last week we refilled her Hydrocodone. Today, we discovered that the pharmacist double filled, resulting in an amount of 120 instead of her usual 60.

The amount charged was double what we are used to, but that didn't trigger any warnings, since they also told us there was some sort of issue with Medicare that we needed to address, which we are in the process of doing. 

This was not billed to Medicare, or any insurance at all, since we didn't have the information they needed at the time. Her plan lapsed and reverted to regular Medicare, which we weren't expecting.

So, we paid the proper amount for 120 pills, not realizing anything was amiss.

We like this pharmacist, and have been working with him for over a decade. We do not want to cause him any trouble in his career or store--it's one of the big chains.

I haven't called the store for fear of inadvertently getting the pharmacist in some sort of trouble. Any ideas on what we should do? Could we apply the overage to next month? Is there a way to make this right without hurting the pharmacist?

TLDR: Pharmacist accidentally dispensed (and billed for) 120 Hydrocodone instead of 60. We noticed the error a week later when refilling dementia patients weekly medicine box. How can/should we handle this to avoid trouble for the pharmacist?

****UPDATE****

Here is how we have handled it so far: We are in the process of placing mom in an ALF, so we called the doctor who prescribed this (and all her other medications) to verify all of her medications in order to update the facility. This is something we have always done regularly anyway to make sure WE were handling her meds properly, and inquired directly about all of her recent prescriptions. They have a new online portal now, listing all the prescriptions, amounts and dates. The prescription WAS, in fact, written for the proper amount of 60. Again, it was filled with 120, double the prescribed amount.

I went to the pharmacy, but another pharmacist was on duty, so I didn't discuss the issue. I gather, after looking at your answers and other google results, that this could be a serious error and I want to discuss it only with the pharmacist who filled it.

I will try again tomorrow, later in the day, and see if he is working and ask him then.

Since no insurance was billed, I am tempted to just keep quiet about this rather than put the pharmacist in what may be a difficult situation. The bottle has the usual instructions, which are ""Take twice daily by mouth"". Quantity filled is 120, though. The quantity is circled and initialed, though I don't know what that means.

medicine,Case discussion,"Greetings, after a few people suggested in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/37f30p/any_subreddits_for_case_discussions/) thread that I post the case/situation I was curious about I figured I do it and see what I could learn.

Case (some minor details changed/generalized for anonymity)

Older woman hx most notable for rheumatoid arthritis (on etanercept, methotrexate, sulfasalazine) initially presents to the emergency department after 3 days progressively worsening left sided headache with associated transient neurologic symptoms (left leg numbness, slurred speech, leftward veering gait, all resolved prior to initial presentation). Evaluation at that time found patient without neurologic deficit, head CT negative for acute pathology, chest xray with possible early right lower lobe opacity. ED discharges patient with prescription for azithromycin and prednisone.

Patient returns to ED 24 hours later with persistence/worsening of headache. Undergoes lumbar puncture at this time with initial studies negative (gram stain 1+ WBC, no organisms, cell count 0 reds, 0 whites, glucose and protein stone cold normal) CXR demonstrates interval worsening of right lower lobe opacity, patient started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. IM team (me) called to admit patient for pneumonia.

History gathered from patient at this time reinforces chief complaint of headache, no respiratory complaints, subjective fevers the night between ED visits but otherwise negative review of systems (admitted the patient with a 3rd year medical student so while I was typing/putting in orders I let her go through the entirety of a ROS card). 

Vitals in the ED largely WNL until just prior to patient febrile to 38C. Physical exam: Generally well appearing older woman, no acute distress, breathing comfortably. Left eye with mild injection. Lungs with scattered wheezes, crackles in right lower lobe. Hands with chronic changes consistent with RA. Otherwise no significant findings.

Labs
basic metabolic panel: WNL
CBC: White blood cell count 13 (down from 15 from day prior ED visit)

My impression at this point:

Headache: not entirely certain as to the etiology. Given negative LP low likelihood of representing meningitis. Transient neurologic symptoms could represent transient ischemic attack however patient without focal deficit on current exam. Low likelihood to represent mass given transient nature of symptoms. At this point in time I feel that it could just be a head-ache and was willing to monitor with pain control.

RLL opacity/community acquired pneumonia: Patient without respiratory complaint but with fever, leukocytosis and imaging consistent with pneumonia. Patient without healthcare exposure (though with chronic immunosuppression) felt that general community acquired pneumonia treatment with ceftriaxone/azithromycin IV was reasonable until/unless cultures offered alternative avenue for therapy or patient clinically declined indicating need alternate therapy.

My attending's plan (slightly editorialized as I'm uncertain of her exact thought process)

Headache: still relatively high likelihood of meningitis, also with concern for cerebral vasculitis or posterior fossa mass (leftward veering triggering this thought). Consult rheumatology (at 5 PM), discontinue ceftriaxone/azithromycin. Start ampicillin, vancomycin, cefepime, obtain MRI/MRA brain

Pneumonia: covered by above antibiotics. 

My questions are these:

Would my initial plan for this patient have been reasonable?  Should I have been more conservative given patient's immunocompromised status?

Is my attending's plan overly conservative? If so where?

How would you approach this patient?

........................................................................................................................................................................
Updates:
HD#2: initially narrowed from amp, cefepime, and vanco to ceftriaxone and vanco after discussion with antibiotic stewardship team. Patient had refused MRI at this point and generally was looking better/headache was improving.  Late in the day patient looked worse, headache worsened (8.5/10 per patient) and febrile to ~101F. Resumed prior ABX (vanc, amp, cefepime). Patient worried enough to decide to go through with MRI.

HD#3: Patient again feeling better, no more febrile episodes since evening prior, MRI negative for acute findings, leukocytosis resolved. Discussed patient briefly with ID (initial recs while getting formal consult), felt meningitis very low likelihood--&gt;stop ampicillin, continue on vanc and cefepime until they can fully evaluate patient, obtain chest CT.  Given injection of left eye obtained ophthalmology consult --&gt;keratoconjunvivitis, mild occular HTN --&gt; bacitracin goop, steroid eye drops.  Chest CT back at end of day: RLL consolidation, small pleural effusion.

HD#4: patient feeling great, headache largely resolved wants to go home. ID recommends discharge with levofloxacin (think likely community acquired but some concern for legionella).

biotech,Searching for entry-level biotech career in San Francisco Bay Area/Silicon Valley before moving there. Looking for any advice!,"Hello,

I am currently searching for an entry-level biotech position in the San Francisco Bay Area/Silicon valley. I would like to secure a position before moving there, and I would be relocating at my own expense. This prospect seems quite daunting, as I will be competing with current residents for job opportunities. I am wondering if anyone is experienced with this job search strategy and has any advice for maximizing my chances of obtaining employment when I am not already located where I want to work.

pharmacy,Was cheating ever an issue at the Pharmacy Schools you attended?,"I recently finished up my first year of Pharmacy School at a well established public school. School with a good reputation, not a degree mill. 

However the whole time I had to struggle with the reality of cheating at this school. Cheating not limited to a few students but almost the whole student body. In fact even the administration was aware of the wide scale cheating but did little .

Essentially the only way to make an A is to get your hands on old test. And I had to do the same. 

I'm having  serious issue dealing with this. My own outlook on my education has gone completely negative. I feel that it's devaluing my degree, my efforts and myself. I'm paying 100K for an education that I'm cheating through. If I don't cheat then my GPA won't be competitive.

medicine,Medical student with questions about hospitalist medicine.,"I was just wondering if there are any hospitalist here who can answer a couple questions for me.  I have just finished my first year and I have no idea what a hospitalist actually does on a regular shift. I know the specialize in im, peds, fm, and the shifts are 12 hrs.  So my questions are

How many patients do you have per shift?

Do the 7  12 hr shifts in a row wear you out?  Is hospitalist medicine something a person can do into their 60s? 

Do you feel you really help improve the health and lives of your patients, or is hospitalist medicine more impersonal shift work where you rarely see the same patient twice and you feel like you are just managing diabetes and other chronic disease?

Lastly, do you think demand will always be there??",20,13,2015-05-31,PHARMA,0.02642793394625187,0.9057336449623108,0.0678384006023407

pharmacy,Medicare Billing Questions,"Hello r/pharmacy. I lurk here fairly often and have learned quite a bit from the posts here. I have a fairly complicated question that I'm hoping you'll be able to help with. 

A patient has a Medicare plan that is paying x amount of dollars towards a drug. The copay is still $100+. Are there any (federal, state) restrictions on using discount cards in lieu of Medicare coverage to get a lower out of pocket cost for the patient? (Obviously would not be combining Medicare + discount card, just using the discount card instead). 

I hope this provides enough information, but if any other details are needed I would be happy to explain further. I've tried looking through the Medicare site and searching Google for quite some time and can't quite come to a definitive answer. I would greatly appreciate if somebody could point me in the direction of some related documentation. Thank you for any and all help you may be able to provide.
