medicine,Help me pick a specialty - do you regret yours?,"I'm sure there are aspects about the nature of your job that are not written on paper - things that you only realised after you got the job and it was too late. 

* Do you never have time to catch a breath? 
* Are you always on-call? 
* Do you get nearly enough sleep as you should? 
* Do you feel depressed often? 
* Is it a fulfilling specialty? 
* Is there a future or a demand for certain specialties in the future?
* Surgery vs Internal?

&amp;amp;nbsp;

Since I got into med school I've been thinking about surgery. That was the case for 4 years. But I talked to this general surgeon recently and he made me doubt my thinking a little bit.
Am I the type of person to dedicate every second of my life to the job? I'm not sure I am. 

&amp;amp;nbsp;

I'm not married now but at some point I could start a family so I'm thinking about when that time comes.

The way the surgeon talked, he made me feel like he never had time for his family and he was more or less an absent father/husband, which is something I would rather avoid. One of the important things for me is not making my family feel like they're sacrificing just by being related to me. I wouldn't want my wife to feel like she made a mistake by saying yes.


&amp;amp;nbsp;

I am graduating in 2018. So far I've done my pediatrics rotation and I'm in Obs/Gyne, then for what's left of the year I've got what I'm actually more interested in - surgery and internal medicine.
Next year we do things like psychiatry, ophthalmology, neurology...

&amp;amp;nbsp;

Regarding what specialties I've considered, of course that depends on my USMLE scores and other things, but hypothetically speaking, if I could pick what I wanted, I've been thinking about general surgery, ophthalmology, radiology, orthopaedics, and cardiology. 

I am interested in technology so perhaps gastroenterology as well, because of all the scopes and what not, but radiology uses a lot of tech too.",74,38,2017-01-02,PHARMA,0.12354496866464615,0.8539146184921265,0.02254043146967888
pharmacy,"Grocery store pharmacists, what's your plan?","I used to be a pharmacist at CVS, but luckily only had to stay there for a year and a half before I found an opening at a local grocery store. While my quality of life has increased 1000 fold (and even pay has increased a little), it's obvious to me that the future is bleak.  We are the only department in the store that doesn't make money. This is not just at my store. This is for most grocery stores. Pharmacy has the highest payroll of a grocery store, yet they often don't make any money. There will be little incentive for grocery store owners to keep pharmacies as profits keep decreasing. Every pharmacist meeting I go to, numbers are always in the red (although we've benefited this year a little from A&amp;P's closing -- sorry guys). Our ownership has been trying to be proactive by promoting vaccinations and MTM, but even with the addition of those services, reimbursements are still too low and insurance companies forcing people to use mandatory mail order will continue the downtrend.

I'd like to stay where I'm at as long as I can, but it's tough when it feels like we're in a dying business. I don't want to wake up when I'm 40 or 50 and be forced to head to CVS or Walgreens with no other options(and those companies would probably prefer to hire new grads anyway).

medicine,When do you know you're in the wrong profession?,"I am looking to this community for some perspective. I am nearing the end of my training in a competitive internal medicine subspecialty. On paper, I am well-trained, having attended the #1 ranked school/program for 3/4 stages of my academic life (college, med school, residency, fellowship). But increasingly I feel despondent that I am not enjoying my day-to-day, resentful at the number of hours that the profession has stolen from spending with my wife and family, angry at the ""wasted"" years in my 20s (I did not take any years off) and bitter that what was billed to me as an upstanding career that ""helps people"" seems increasingly to be a hopeless cycle of people that do not get better and patients that do not appreciate my work. I feel pressured to stay in academic medicine, and yet I don't think a 9-5 5 days a week is feasible anymore, with all the paperwork and nonsense that causes 9-5 to become 7am-8pm. I feel ashamed that I have sunk my life and time into this so far, being at all the top programs but being so increasingly unhappy. And, at the end of the day, I don't feel like what my attendings do really ""matters"".. maybe rarely is a single person/family really impacted but otherwise it feels like just churning a wheel.


I feel an impending crisis. Has anyone else been in this situation before? What resources might be helpful and supportive? Or are all these warning signs that I might really be in the wrong line of work and that I should reconsider my whole path up until now (or find some non-clinical work whereby I'd still be able to take advantage of my board certifications and training)?

medicine,"My employer is a sinking ship, and I'm feeling unmoored","I am an American family physician only one year out of residency. I was very much a non-traditional med school graduate, who has had a colorful and varied set of life experiences prior to getting into medicine. I was hired by an old, medium-sized practice in rural America that has remained stubbornly independent and physician-owned. I made it consistently clear to them when I was hired that work-life balance was my number one priority, and was reassured that this was in line with their philosophy.

Come to find out my practice is not doing well financially. As I understand it, in a very law-of-the-jungle sort of way, my practice is simply not able to demand the same reimbursement from insurance carriers, because they lack the financial and legal clout of larger healthcare organizations.

As a result, I have been pushed by my boss and his right hand man to carry heavier and heavier workloads, in direct opposition to what I was promised. I was hired on a two-year contract at a salary the practice cannot afford to pay me, which interestingly enough is significantly lower than the base salary most corporate-owned practices pay a full-time primary care provider. I have then been goaded and guilt-tripped by way of subtle headgames into taking on heavier and heavier workloads in order to justify the enormous financial sacrifice the partners made in hiring me. I feel taken for a ride, and overworked. This is not what I signed up for.

My question is, where to now? I'd like to be able to conclude that as a noob, I was bamboozled by some desperate and not-very-good businessmen. But what I fear is that what I've experienced is nothing uncommon, and is actually very typical of the turbulent state of my industry. I fear that I'm entering a work field where there is no way a family physician who insists on quality over quantity has any chance of making a living anymore.

I am a very simple man, who is not at all materialistic, and doesn't have expensive tastes in anything. I did, however, impregnate my wife with natural multiples (i.e. no IVF!), and I need to provide for them. Of course I have student debts to pay. I also demand some modicum of leisure time to enjoy the admittedly cheap and simple pleasures that make life worth living for me.

Any serious advice would be much appreciated.

medicine,"I need some advice, possibly legal advice.","I am the resident pediatrician for a small private hospital in Africa. I got into work today and found a situation. 

A 7 month old baby was brought in last night for cough and fever. The doctor prescribed amoxyclav and paracetamol suppository. Pharmacy for one reason or other dispensed pantoprazole 40mg oral tablet to the parents instead of the suppository. The parents read the prospectus and realised the blunder. They have made it known that they intend to sue the hospital. We don't know if the pantoprazole was actually given p.r.

Management has requested that I be there when the parents return all lawyered up. The hospital and pharmacist is clearly in the wrong here. How can I make this better for us, and more importantly, the child? Haven't been involved in any legal problems thus far, let alone medicolegal. How should I handle this as the pediatrician? What are some of the things I should be weary of?

EDIT: The child was given the pantoprazole p.r. We have called our lawyer. We have called the parents as well to bring the child in for review and monitoring over the next 24 hours. They have agreed. Waiting for them to rock up. Hoping for an amicable conclusion to this. Admin will do as they please with the pharm tech.

EDIT 2: Met the parents and child. They were very calm and amicable. No lawyers. Child was still febrile obviously since they had no antipyretic. On taking history the problem became a bit more clear. The pharm tech dispensed the brand name Panto-Denk instead of Para-Denk. What saved the day was that the mother managed to retrieve the tablet a few minutes after p.r. insertion when they realised it was a wrong medication. They showed it to me. It was pretty much intact. I gave them the correct medication, apologised and sent them home to return after 3 days for review. I hope that closes the case. Advised chief of pharmacy to address the actual problem at hand i.e. mix up of meds. 

Thank you all for you advice and contributions.",51,48,2017-01-05,PHARMA,0.10364546626806259,0.8715652227401733,0.024789324030280113

medicine,"Attending physicians, in an inpatient setting, how closely do you follow the PA/NPs patients?","I am a fairly new PA and am working as a hospitalist in medicine.  In our facility, we have teams, each with an MD and PA/NP assigned.  The PA/NP takes about half of the patients and is the primary contact, does the documentation, daily follow-up on orders, consulting, etc with the oversight of the MD who sees all patients on the team.  

If you are in a similar situation, how much supervision do you provide?  I notice a significant discrepancy between the perceived amount of attention my attending pays to my patients, from things ranging to vitals, labs, orders, medications, to past medical history, etc.  

I ask because I obviously have less training and experience than my MD attendings, therefore I rely on their expertise to somewhat confirm that my care is appropriate.

medicine,Call Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker right now to veto licensing naturopaths (S.2335),"**UPDATE** The Gov. signed the bill. Thank you everyone for your efforts. Looks like the quacks won this round. https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/01/11/naturopaths-get-their-own-licensing-board/Lk12PKB7jAYN1z8alxTw9K/story.html

In a mysterious out of session period, the Massachusetts legislature passed a bill that would legitimize naturopathy in the state. The bill is now sitting on the governors desk. He could do nothing and let the bill expire on Jan. 13, or he could codify the pseudoscientific health fraud that is naturopathy into state law.

You can reach Gov. Charlie Baker at 617-725-4005.

For background see these:

* https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/oh-no-not-again-massachusetts-legislature-passes-naturopathic-licensing-bill/
* https://www.naturopathicdiaries.com/naturopathic-doctors-in-massachusetts/
* https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2017/01/07/baker-should-veto-naturopath-licensing-bill/UY8sSmE2ux6EBWACCFlBGP/story.html

Key points to explain to the governor's aides:

* Naturopaths do not attend medical school, but are trained in medical pseudoscience, such as homeopathy.
* Naturopaths consistently misrepresent their medical abilities.
* Naturopaths do not have effective or safe methods for treating chronic pain.
* Naturopaths seek licensure to fight for mandatory insurance reimbursement for their services, which would inflate wasteful healthcare spending
* Naturopaths seeking licensure claim they are safer practitioners than other kinds of naturopaths, but there is no discernible difference. All naturopaths practice using pseudoscientific methods that have been disproven and shunned by medical professions for causing patient harm.

Surgical nurse here. I've been nursing for 5 years, and I deal with multiple staff docs and residents on a daily basis. I hear a lot from nurses about how doctors could make our jobs easier, but I haven't heard from you on how we can make your jobs easier.

You're busy. You have way more patients than I do. How can a nurse ensure that she or he is utilizing you appropriately? What do we do that helps you do your job? What do we do that hinders your ability to provide appropriate patient care?

What do you wish nurses knew?

pharmacy,A question for non-faculty preceptors out there,"Hey guys,

Something happened this week, and I wanted to see if this is considered a common practice.

I am a clinical pharmacist at an academic health center, and I am paid by that health center.  I am not on faculty of any pharmacyschool, though I occasionally precept pharmacy students on APPEs (about 2 per year).  I am not directly paid for precepting, but it is part of my job description, so I do it without complaint and actually enjoy it.

Recently, a course coordinator at the pharmacy school for which I precept invited me to deliver a series for lectures for the P-3 class he was coordinating.  During the course of planning my lectures, I discovered that they weren't planning to offer any payment for my work, that it was considered to be on a voluntary basis.

Is this a common practice, i.e. pharmacy schools asking you to deliver lectures for their courses for no compensation?  Have you engaged in this?  If so, what value do you get to justify your investment of time and effort?

Also, if any students are reading this, would it upset you if you discovered that your tuition wasn't going toward the compensation of the lecturers that delivered your courses?",23,25,2017-01-21,PHARMA,0.027451438829302788,0.9370206594467163,0.035527925938367844

medicine,UPDATE: How does a doctor married to a surgeon make it work? Having a lot of trouble these days.,"Original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/55b04m/how_does_a_doctor_married_to_a_surgeon_make_it/

Figured I'd update given the surprising interest in the topic.

So as it often happens - things got worst before they got better-ish. My partner decided to take on even more duties, deciding to become involved in teaching. He would now come home from work and be making powerpoint presentations and stressing over interactive cases for medical students. I continued to feel lonely and isolated - I'm one of the few female anesthetists at my institution so finding girl friends has been really hard. I've tried to maintain my hobbies, but at some point, you get tired of being alone all day.

Finally, I hit my last straw - we had a huge falling out one Friday night about a month ago and I ended up spewing all my feelings and then some. I had planned to sit down and discuss my concerns with him in a calm and reasonable manner but that all fell out the window. I ended up asking him to stay with a friend for the weekend, as I was just too upset and didn't trust myself to not further antagonize the issue.

After the weekend apart, we both cooled down and sat down and had a reasonable discussion. He agreed he was taking on too much, but he also felt like he had no other choice, as this seems to be the expected status quo among his peers. After lots and lots of talking, he agreed he'd sit down with his supervisors and see if he could at least drop the graduate degree he was pursuing. 

It was a step in the right direction - he's put his grad work on hold for now, but has replaced some of that free time with medical education pursuits. His justification is that to work in an academic centre as an orthopod, he needs all the advantages he can get. I can see that it does make him happy - he was inspired by a great mentor and wants to pay it forward to students and I find this admirable.

We've instituted mandatory date nights and that's really helped. I've also joined some classes and clubs to expand my own social circle - I definitely feel like over the years, I've become dependant on medicine to provide me with all my sources of entertainment, including a pre-made social circle, so I'm trying to move beyond that. So there's improvement and I think that's all I can ask for at this point!

Earlier this month, he stared hinting at marriage - just comments like ""oh that would be a nice place to get married"" or ""we could take our honeymoon when I finish X project"" . It's been in the conversation before and I think we both knew the relationship was heading there. Part of me wonders, rather naively I'm sure, if this is a sign of his commitment to further working on the relationship - I have always said that I wanted to get married once we'd ""settled in"" to our careers and I wonder if he's hinting that he's nearing that point? Another part of me wonders if its terrible timing - almost an appeasement to my unhappiness? I've had these discussions with him, but I find I always come out of the conversation still unsure of how I feel. There is no question I love the man, just not sure how this would work with kids and marriage! 

At the end of the day, if I can offer any piece of advice to those married to a surgeon - be prepared to have it take over your life too in some ways. In anesthesia, my colleagues and I will always say how we love being in the OR but are so happy we're not surgeons - but being married to one means you still get the surgery lifestyle encroaching on your own! I love my partner and that makes it worth it but it presents a unique set of challenges that doesn't just disappear once residency is done!",23,122,2017-01-26,PHARMA,0.06362452358007431,0.9068092107772827,0.029566241428256035

medicine,Physicians of Reddit: What minutiae do other's commonly misunderstand in your area of daily practice?,"For example: In lung auscultation I feel that there is a significant misunderstanding of many of the terms used to describe various breath sounds heard during bedside auscultation. Rales, Rhonchi, Crepitations, Crackles, Wheeze, Fine and Coarse, Sonourous Rhonchi etc- many of which are understood very differently between clinicians.

To put this to rest - René Laennec, the inventor of the first crude stethoscope at the Necker Hospital for Sick Kids in the early 1800's, first began to describe his auscultatory findings of this new device in his patient population. TB was rampant at the time in Paris, and as word of Dr. Laennec's stethoscope spread, patients began to fear his bedside findings of the ""Râle"" (the French term for rattle - known colloquially as the ""death rattle of TB"" amongst terrified patients). After realising the fear he would instill into those with new diagnoses of TB using the word 'rattle' to describe his findings (coarse crackles by today's standards) Laennec simply switched to using the Latin word for rattle - Rhoncus/Rhonci - to build that intellectually verbal barrier between patients, something still done very much so to this day. 

In 1821 Laennec's​ work on the steth (including individual lung sounds) was translated into English by John Forbes. Forbes incorrectly translated some aspects of his work - particularly identifying râle and rhoncus as separate terms, one identifying a coarse crackles and the other meaning a type of wheeze. 

Fast forward to the 1980's and the International Lung Sounds association attempted to consolidate the aforementioned confusing terms. Essentially, there are only 2 types of sounds heard on the vast majority of lung exams - crackles and wheezes. Crackles are discontinuous, wheezes are continuous. Sounds can be inspiratory, expiratory or both. Crackles can be fine or coarse - nothing else.

Lung sounds should be recorded in 3 steps in notes.


1. Air entry: Good air entry or Poor air entry


2. Breath Sounds: Vesicular, Bronchovesicular or Bronchial


3. Adventitious sounds: Crackle (Coarse or Fine); Wheeze; Stridor and their relation to INSP/EXP

Crepitations are the British English term for crackles. Rales and Rhonci do not exist anymore as appropriate clinical terms (although not quite true for Rhonci - which is still used in some experimental settings for auscultatory recordings - but for the most part forget they exist).

Are there any interesting examples of similar nuanced aspects of medicine in your clinical practice?",425,327,2017-01-27,PHARMA,0.15610142052173615,0.8207149505615234,0.02318364940583706

medicine,Effect of new executive order on immigration on physicians who are training or practicing in the US,"This is something I've been following closely since it was signed as it has the potential to affect a few friends/people I trained with. Unfortunately, this will impact physicians, residents and medical students originally from one of the included countries (Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia)

1. US permanent residents/green card holders are now banned.

2. People visiting the US on a valid visa (work, education, going to a conference, tourism, etc.) are also now banned.

3. More relevant to the people I know, if you were in a position where you have joint Canadian citizenship and citizenship from an affected country, you are also apparently banned from the US.

Affected people have either been denied entry to flights returning to the US, or detained upon arriving in the US and denied access to legal counsel. 

In the short-term, if this affects you or anyone you know and you are currently in the US, the current recommendation is to avoid leaving the US at any point. If you are outside of the US, and planning on entering to start a fellowship/residency position/going to a conference/go on vacation/etc. you should ensure ASAP that you will not blocked from flying to the US, or detained upon arrival. In either situation, you should probably seek some combination of legal counsel or more information from relevant organizations before making any travel plans. 

I hope this doesn't negatively impact patient care, but I'll admit my most immediate concern is physicians being indefinitely detained without access to a lawyer.

In the long-term, I hope that this executive order is revised somewhat.

[Lawyers at DHS are scrambling to understand the order and parse out what it means for procedures at airport checkpoints and ports of entry around the country.

Immigration and customs officers are struggling to figure out which incoming travelers to let in while at the same time keep up with the normal flow of travel, the senior US immigration official said.](http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-trailguide-updates-unknown-number-of-u-s-permanent-1485627539-htmlstory.html).

[Thomas Michel, a senior cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School, also reported one of his fellows couldn't travel to Boston Saturday.

**Edit:**

[Some institutions were already taking action before Trump signed the order. At a major teaching hospital in Ohio, one official said he had sent instructions to administrators telling them to cancel offers of residency to medical students from some countries. “We are literally going to look at ‘Country of origin’ and remove the applicant based on [that],” said the official, who did not want to be named criticizing the policy. “Can’t get more racist than that.” ](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-refugees-order-reaction-20170127-story.html)

**Edit:**

A federal court has halted deportations. However people affected by the order with valid greencards and visas who were not in transit at the time are still likely stuck abroad.

medicine,Physicians of reddit: how do you personally deal with the deaths of long-term patients?,"Dear Meddit. I've been in GI practice for about a decade. I've seen patients pass away, and felt poorly, grieved, and then went on with practice.

However, over the past six months, I've had several long-term patients pass away. And it has been bothering me a lot.

It is so different when they have been your patients for a long time. I liked them a lot and it is really making me very sad. I got to know them and their families. It is almost like close friends dying. There is a lot of primary care in GI with the inflammatory bowel disease population and you get to know patients quite well.

Throw on the always-present feeling of ""could I have done something better"" to change the outcome and, even if there wasn't, I still feel like crap.

I suppose this is normal, but has anyone else experienced something similar? How have you dealt with it?

And how do your deal with your emotions when patients' families are going through far worse emotions. One of my attendings once counselled me [not to attend funerals](http://healthydebate.ca/faces-health-care/palliative-care-peter) -- because physicians are a reminder of the difficult times and families should be remembering the happy times of their loved one.

medicine,PSA: The pathology job market really is abysmal.,"I realize that the poor path market is considered common knowledge in medicine. But every couple months I see trainees interested in path posting here, whose concerns about the job market are usually dispelled as ""internet fear mongering"", or who are lulled to complacency by the story of the mythical ""retirement cliff"".  I also realize that anecdotes do not make compelling arguments. Nevertheless, here is my attempt at a good-will PSA.

These are my stats:

- AMG from a well regarded medical school, with &gt;240s step scores, HP and honors in &gt;50% of 3rd and 4th year rotations. 

- Did an intern year and transitioned to pathology at a well-regarded residency.

- ~7 publications (including several 1st authorships), and over a dozen posters/platform presentations at major meetings.

- Former Chief Resident.

- 2 fellowships, both at elite institutions (very well liked by attendings I worked with).

- Board certified in anatomic and clinical pathology.

- Really good at pathology (&gt;95th percentile on in-service exams, etc).

- Medical licenses in 4 highly populated states (intern, residency, fellowship x 2)

- Still currently in training, so no unemployment, etc to account for.

- I do not have autism.


Over the past 4 months, I have literally sent out at least 50 well-worded, carefully crafted inquiries to pathology groups all over the country. I've talked to half a dozen recruiters, some specifically specializing in pathology placement. I've spoken with every single attending at my current (and previous) fellowship about possible contacts or unposted jobs.  I've applied to every ad I've seen in pathoutlines, careermd, indeed, doccafe, recruiter websites, etc, that I would be remotely qualified for. I even applied to a couple jobs in New Zealand and Saudi Arabia just for fun. 


I've had 1 interview, and 0 job offers. The single interview was at a private GI group that employs their pathologist and skims the the path's PC to split between the group (I said no thanks).
