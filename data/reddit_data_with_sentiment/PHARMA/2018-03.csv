medicine,Primary care MD here. The anxiety is becoming overwhelming.,"I practice as a primary care physician in a group, two years out of residency. I am a top producer here, seeing 40+ patients per day. I have always had some tendencies toward anxiety, and probably some GAD, but I have kept a handle on it, even through residency. I have kept it buried well.

It is taking over now. Anxiety about demanding and entitled patients, patients constantly threatening this or that because a refill wasn't addressed instantaneously, even trivial little things. I work in my sleep. I feel dread when my alarm clock wakes me in the morning. I had my first panic attack over the weekend - at least I hope it was just panic and not angina. It absolutely has not affected my patient care, but I worry it will could eventually. (My friend knows and is keeping an eye on that). I can only hold things together by will for so long though.

Medicine is a hugely stressful field, with zero tolerance for mistakes in one of the most complex professions one can follow, with demanding and entitled patients, and with many other issues.  How do you cope with it? I'm looking for a way to continue on.",123,479,2018-03-01,PHARMA,0.16652622818946838,0.8029232621192932,0.030550517141819

medicine,Misrepresentation of being a doctor?,"This is random, but I work in the mental health field as a counselor. In my city there is a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner with a doctorate in some area of research. He refers to himself as Dr. Lastname. As a counselor, I think it is best for my clients to see board certified psychiatrists. I respect that an NP degree is a challenging thing to receive and that he does have a legitimate phd, however these families see his title of Dr. and go to him, thinking he's a psychiatrist when he's not. He does sometimes list himself as ""Dr. Lastname, PMHNP-BC"" but it still seems really unethical.

First off, are there any legal risks?  It's (obviously) legal in my state (requiring a registered pharmacist to dispense), but still being schedule 1 federally, what risks are there?  If the DEA decides to crack down, could they just come in and arrest everyone working there?  Things like that?

medicine,How do you keep going when you're just spent?,"I'm a fellow now eight months into my first year.  I had always planned to do this fellowship and was fortunate to match at a great institution.  However, I'm not really sure I can do this anymore.  This year is entirely clinical and I am essentially the only contact person for our service.  Which means I have to be constantly available and tied to my phone.  Additionally, they made changes in the fellowship after the first of the year that took away almost all of my admin time.  I still have the same responsibilities, just no time to do it--and thanks to an ancient EMR at one of our hospitals, these things can only be accomplished while on campus, yet I now spend most of my time at the other hospital.  Not to mention I'm the one that has to cover everyone's clinics when they're on vacation or at conferences, while still doing all the prep and follow-up for mine even the rare times I am away.  Etc., etc.

Not to mention I moved over 1000 miles away from all my family and friends to do this fellowship.  I'm always working and on call, so I have no friends in my new city and spend what little free time I have in my tiny apartment staring at the TV.  I'm exhausted and at the end of the rope.  Simply put, I'm just spent.  The idea of four more months of this seems unimaginable.  The difference from residency is that I have a feasible fallback option.  I could just move back home and be a generalist in my field.  I'm at the point where the long term effects of that choice really don't matter to me and it seems like a better option with every successive day.

All this rambling leads me to one question.  How do you keep going when you're just spent?  I'm just done and struggling to keep going.  Thanks for your thoughts.",9,29,2018-03-02,PHARMA,0.026186715811491013,0.9175166487693787,0.05629659816622734

pharmacy,How Bad Did I Fuck Up?,"New pharmacist here. About 5 months under my belt. I've been really struggling with insurance and I've been relying on our seasoned tech for all the billing. A few days ago, this bit me in the ass. We just hired 3 new techs with no pharmacy experience. It was just me and one other tech in the pharmacy when the incident happened. Essentially, it was the blind leading the blind.

My perspective:
A lady drops off a script with the new tech for Tamiflu. The tech inputs it and can't process the claim because we don't have insurance information. (New tech didn't think to ask. Of course the patient doesn't tell us). Lady comes back to pick up the Tamiflu and its not ready. When I ask her for her insurance information she said something like ""Why didn't you call me? My son is sick."" I didn't know what to say so I said ""I should have"" even though I've literally never seen anyone in the pharmacy call a patient if we didn't have insurance information. She was pretty pissed and gave her insurance card and left.

We only have brand name Tamiflu (suspension) in stock (anyone else in this boat btw?), so her copay was like $60. I called the insurance company and they wouldn't budge. I called her to tell her and she's like ""My son is sick. I'll pay whatever I have to. Have it ready in 20 minutes."" So we got it ready. When she tried to pay, her HSA card wouldn't work. I'm new. I have no idea wtf is going on. I paged the store manager to help and she couldn't figure it out. The lady got super mad and started dropping the f bomb and telling the new tech that she hopes she can't sleep at night. I didn't know what to do and I sheepishly just kept checking other prescriptions. She eventually paid with her credit card and filed a complaint. Our PIC is really mad.

What our PIC said I should have done:
When we found out we didn't have information, we should have searched for it using a search system thing. I'll admit, he did show it to me before, but I've always relied on our techs for that and I completely forgot about it. I apparently should have called a different insurance company to ask for the override? I still don't understand the whole insurance world. I just called the number that was provided under our ""agency help"" tab, which was for express scripts. He wrote down the ""correct"" number for us (he had it memorized) which wasn't even for express scripts (we used the ""correct number"" the next day for a tamilflu script btw and they gave us an override). As far as the HSA malfunction goes, apparently our pharmacy has an issue accepting some HSA cards. There was an email sent out with directions to work around it literally 2 hours before the incident (I didn't see the email because I was busy working).

In short, if our seasoned tech was there, this never would have happened. If I would have thought to search for her insurance and called the correct number for the override, this never would have happened.

I feel really bad. This whole insurance world is just overwhelming to me. I spent 6 years learning the clinical side of pharmacy and that isn't enough to do the job, apparently. I have had literally no training with insurance. I actually asked our district manager for additional training after the incident, but we'll see if that ever happens. I feel like I've been only doing and was prepared for only 50% of the job and now I feel overwhelmed. Fuck. Someone hands me an insurance card and I basically shit my pants now.

Anyway, I guess that was my first official complaint after 5 months. Its a learning experience for sure. Best believe I'll be using that search function and calling the correct number from now on. The thing is, suppose someone has something other than express scripts? I still have no idea wtf to do then.

On a scale of 1-10, how bad did I fuck up?

medicine,How to handle alternative practitioners,"So I lost another one today to an alternative health practitioner. Another young patient whose only chance is chemo and XRT, is choosing infusions of mistletoe and ""low dose chemo"".  I actually spoke to the practitioner today who as expected knew nothing about her or her cancer and didn't really seem to care.  This one is a bit more upsetting to me because the practitioner is an actual MD, not an ND or chiropractor.  A quick google search shows she has had a questionable past and has lost her license before.  I understand patient autonomy, but there is an actual doctor telling her what the medical community recommends is wrong and the things she does (and only accepts cash for of course) work better than what my rad on and med onc colleagues have to offer.  The doctor isn't board certified, is not on staff anywhere, and isn't part of the major organizations for any specialty (I imagine this is typical for this type of person).  How do we fight this?  If I did something outside of the standard of care I could get kicked off staff, lose my board certifications, and be kicked out of the societies I belong to.  Someone like this has no one to answer to.  Patients don't seem moved to sue them either when things inevitably go poorly.

medicine,"""I want..."", ""I need..."" and other disasters.","Some intro. The nature of the healthcare system in my country is such that a patient only needs to have one simple form from his PCP in order to be referred to a specialist. As PCPs here aren't always doing their job well/are swamped with other things, the referrals are given extremely liberally, almost to the point of ""this is normal, go see him just in case"". This leads a lot of patients coming to specialists with mundane requests.

I personally work at a 3rd level hospital (Neurology), about half of my outpatients consist of musculoskeletal back pains without red flags and any prior workup. Any. Prior. Workup. At. All. This also means that almost all of them and their mother want an MRI. Even though I try to explain why that is unnecessary, occasionally this leads to some tension, bad mood and anger on their part. Afterward, on mine. This is extremely frustrating and unsatisfying for a physician as this ""physician-vendor"" mentality is deeply rooted in the minds of the patients. So...

Do you get these types of demands from patients?
How do you handle them?
Are you cautious about them filling a complain if you do not comply with their requests?
How do you deal with the shitty mood afterward?

medicine,"Can any DO attendings, particularly those in surgery/procedural specialties, comment on their ability in attracting/obtaining patients?","Current MS3 (DO) with somewhat recent ambitions of attaining a surgical residency, particularly CT. I made a post on the med school sub a few days ago and the overwhelming feedback, other than the helpful advice to invent a time machine and become an MD, was that I needed a productive mentor to go to bat for me as it's an exceedingly relationship-based residency.

My neuro anat professor has been my one professor seemingly on my side and willing to help me pursue a CT surgery residency. I spoke to him about finding a mentor, and quite literally within 48 hours he had procured me a short meeting with a CT surgeon in our city. I met with this physician today, and he certainly had a lot of good feedback and advice for me. One comment in particular made me really give pause to the idea of pursuing this. He mentioned that in surgery, patients want ""the best"", whatever they have determined that to be, and will shop around to find that. His personal opinion was that as a DO, I would struggle to attain the patient base that my MD colleagues would have. He referenced his own group of colleagues as a testament to their wide variance in productivity due to the differences in prestige/recognition/connections each surgeon has, and they're all MDs.

He's an older guy, and I can't tell if he's just out of date, doesn't like DOs, or if their might be a kernel of truth to it (particularly in surgery). He seemed like a nice guy overall, so I don't think he said it just said it to rain on my dreams unnecessarily. I can certainly understand (and accept) that as a DO, some patients will not want to see me for whatever reason - not knowing what a DO is, bias against them, assuming an MD is smarter/more capable, whatever. I've also noticed that sometimes a patient will seek out a DO specifically, which always seems exciting initially, only to realize they do it because they think you're some 'other' type of doctor that will give them all sorts of herbal supplements, and I surmise these types of patients are probably not the ones you'll find needing these procedures.

Has anyone actually experienced an issue in attracting patients? First I have heard someone say this to me, but it's hard to second-guess a guy who has been doing CT surgery for 40 years. I know being a DO doesn't necessarily mean you'll have difficult attracting patients as I work with one extremely productive DO, but he's more into ""natural medicine"" and really plays up to the idea that a DO provides holistic treatment. I've been very cognizant of the hurdles in being a DO, but I can't deny that it cut deep to hear that he thought I would struggle to gain a patient base despite how ridiculously hard I've worked in medical school to make a specialty like this a reality.

Edit - I sincerely appreciate the anecdotes from everyone who commented on here. I'm definitely more at ease now to pursue surgery if I feel like I have a reasonable shot in doing so.",86,65,2018-03-08,PHARMA,0.06016068160533905,0.9000157713890076,0.03982357308268547

Adderall has a major level interaction with the Fluoextine, and Bupropion has a moderate level interaction with the Fluoxetine...they both increase the levels of Fluoxetine. So I was concerned of serotonin syndrome.

When I spoke with the MD, she seemed very agitated that I was calling about this. Her reasoning was that it's a low dose of Fluoxetine (10mg) and so it doesn't matter, she wasn't even willing to hear me really.

medicine,How best to handle a patient with a likely terminal diagnosis who is being over-prescribed narcotics?,"In a few weeks I'll be inheriting a patient who has been recently diagnosed with an advanced cancer. However, she is a long standing pain patient within other practices in town and has been bounced around quite a bit due to some drug seeking behaviors and an unwillingness to give her illness its due diligence. She doesn't want conventional treatment, which is her right, but without a full diagnostic workup, we only have her biopsy results to go off of. So my concern is this; I would bounce this patient to pain management in a heartbeat if there wasn't a chance she was terminally ill, but she is unwilling to get any imaging done, and without it we're left with just the biopsy results. I don't doubt that she had pain, but I'm not comfortable prescribing her the obscene amounts of narcotics she's accustomed to getting. At the end of the day, it is my choice whether or not to take her on, but I feel that she represents a substantial risk either of potential overdose (440 MED daily) or of narcotic diversion. Considering her unwillingness to work with us in the appropriate monitoring of her illness, what is my best bet?

pharmacy,Adderall in McArdle's Disease,"Hey everyone quick question.

I am a P3 pharmacy student and I work as a Pharmacy Intern in the ED. I came across a patient admitted overnight for rhabdo secondary to her diagnosed McArdle's disease (I had to google it but its basically inability of a person's muscles to process/breakdown glycogen). Her CK this morning was 24,000. I was going over her med history and noticed she takes Adderall 10mg PO BID

I then did some back tracking in her history at our hospital. She was started on the Adderall  and had her first rhabdo admit through our ED fifteen days later. Since then she has had 5 other visits to the ED for rhabdo with 3 of them resulting in admissions to the hospital. 

I am wondering if the chronology lines up with the exacerbations of her disease. I.E. the twice daily CNS stimulant boosting her catecholamines, muscle tone, HR,  etc etc. My theory was that she this constant Sympathetic stimulation is having a negative effect on the available glycogen stores in her muscles and making her exacerbations more easy to come by. I found a precuation in McArdle's on Micromedex, but absolutely nothing when I search on PubMed

Any ideas/experience? Do I need to bring this up with her Doctor or is it nothing to worry about.

I understand that the combination tablets are preferable for compliance and HCTZ has a comparative ton of those, but I see it used very often for monotherapy as well.

pharmacy,"I highly recommend watching Dirty Money's episode ""Drug Short"" on Netflix about Valeant Pharmaceuticals. But can someone explain what Philidor was or did?","From what I gather...

* Valeant was trying to sell their brand products through their own specialty pharmacy, Philidor Rx.
* Philidor used other pharmacies to bill claims but would fulfill the prescriptions themselves. (big-time fraud)
* Philidor was established independently of Valeant yet showed up on Valeant's financial reports. Lots of confusion on how to break the news to investors, so they claimed that they only had an option to buy Philidor.
* Nail in the coffin is that Philidor was allegedly caught changing prescriptions to push Valeant brand name drugs on to patients. (big-time fraud, again)

Other than that, the vertical integration scheme itself is nothing new in the world of health care and pharmacy, unfortunately. Drug makers increasing their prices for pure profit is nothing new. Valeant just scrapped their R&amp;D and increased their margins as a result. I suppose I should be disgusted that none of how Valeant played their game surprises me. If anything, it shows fractures in our system and the fact that Valeant's top brass got charged with nothing shows that we are complicit with it.

I immediately think back to mental health nursing and think of cyclic vomiting syndrome from cannabis use and went to inform the MD of what I had further assessed. The MD had no idea about the frequent showering for relief of nausea and looked at me like I was an idiot. She said we weren't going to get the urine drug screen that I suggested and made me feel like I was stupid in front of all my co-workers like that wasn't a real thing. What and why do you think the MD did that and why wouldn't she order the urine drug screen?

The second overall question is, let's say a person is on beta blockers for paroxysmal a fib and comes to the hospital in sinus rhythm. Can the discontinuation of the beta blocker result in the patient converting back to a fib? The way I understand it, beta blockers are NOT rhythm control drugs and therefore wouldn't be able to convert people into sinus rhythm when they are in fib. So I extend that to also mean that their discontinuation shouldn't result in people converting OUT of sinus either.

I am chief of a surgical service right now and having issues with a mid-level resident. Would love some advice!

Resident has a family with kids, and he has had some health issues in the past. He has done training elsewhere prior to joining our program and is in fact PGY level two years above me however is four years behind me in our training. He is more than adequate with floor work, surgery, consults, and all clinical medicine.

The ISSUE is he is an awful teammate. He has over 10-15 call requests per month for family issues. He leaves every day as soon as his cases are done without helping the team. He is completely incapable of taking any feedback or instruction from me as the chief of service. Any time I ask him to stay later, perform a task or see a consult I get a TON of attitude or it is thrown right back at me to do it myself. Finally, and what bothers me the most is that he undermines me to the rest of our largish team (7 people). He questions my management and tries to change the plans the attending surgeons have TOLD ME to implement. He also mocks me to the other residents (behind my back of course).

I am very non-confrontational and nice, have never had an issue like this in seven years of training. I tried to discuss the issues with him in a non-aggressive manner and he implied I was targeting him and reported it to staff who asked me to just drop it. They indicated they know he is an issue, but has been involved with HR and they do not want to push it and risk HR violation or lawsuit. 

I feel like I am on constant egg shells with this person and I genuinely think they are a good doctor! I really just want a harmonious workplace and this person seems to be just completely out for themselves.

Has anyone else dealt with a similar person and is there good advice to handle it in a safe way?

I am graduating soon and have a great job lined up. I am confident in my abilities both clinically and technically with absolutely no fear of starting practice but this is making my last few months just miserable.

pharmacy,New to r/Pharmacy; advice for a prospective Pharm.D. student starting to have doubts?,"Hey everyone,

So I graduated from TCU with a degree in biochemistry, decent-ish GPA (3.3). I didn't really know what I wanted to do from there and it seemed like graduate school was the only option. I've always been interested in drugs and how they work, so I thought maybe pharmacy school would be a good idea.

So, I took the PCAT and scored in the 99th percentile (was unaware that I was that smart/well prepared). I got into a few schools here in Texas but was turned down by UT, which was a huge disappointment.  

In the meantime, I took a job as a pharm tech trainee at a Wal-Mart pharmacy, and it really turned me off to the profession. I know it was retail, and probably not the best example of retail, but I started getting really depressed and am wondering if I even want to do this at all. I didn't realize how repetitive the job was; it felt like I was working on an assembly line. I quit after about 4 months and am tutoring for now.

On top of that, I'm increasingly getting the vibe that most of the pharm school students I talk to are kind of miserable. They all talk about how they have no time/money and how tough the courses are. I'm considering taking a job for a medical technology company in Wisconsin instead and foregoing this whole thing.

In short, I'm wondering what advice you would give me, what makes the job satisfying to you, what other areas of pharmacy might be more hands-on and less repetitive labor-wise, and maybe what made you want to go to pharmacy school. I would love the salary they make, but I wouldn't love getting yelled at by customers/doctors and doing the same couple tasks over and over and over all day long.

Hopefully I didn't bum any of y'all out too much. I'd appreciate any advice.",50,21,2018-03-15,PHARMA,0.22713811695575714,0.7489948868751526,0.02386702597141266

Case scenario (sorry for the length):

You are working an overnight shift in your busy community ER. Although your location has an EMR, physicians still pick up physical charts in order to claim patients. You pick up the chart of a patient that is in bed 12. You see that on the physical chart she is a 66yo F that has presented for chest pain. The patient's triage vital signs are T: 98.4F, HR: 61, BP: 185/111, O2sat: 99%. Under the triage report the following is stated: ""The pt arrives via EMS for severe substernal chest pain. The pt is diaphoretic and has had multiple episodes of emesis. EMS gave pt 325mg ASA, 2 nitro sprays, and nitropaste was placed on the patient's chest without any improvement in pain."" (Despite my frequent objections, our triage nurses continue to write too much on the triage report). You quickly look through the physical chart and see that there is no ECG present from my facility or from EMS, and you have not signed any ECGs recently. The patient has been in the department for 30 minutes. 

You quickly go into the room to make sure the patient is okay and find her clutching her chest (positive Levine's sign) and in significant distress having difficulty cooperating with history taking due to pain, and the nurse is in there attempting to get a line. The patient states her pain started 1 hr prior to presentation and is a burning pain w/o radiation. She only has a history of poorly controlled hypertension stating her BP normally runs between 160-180 systolic. On exam, she has 2+ symmetrical pulses in all extremities, she has no murmurs, and lungs are clear to auscultation. You tell the nurse to give sublingual nitro and to keep giving it every 5 mins until the pain stops or she has received 3 doses, and then come let you know how she has responded. You also inform her that the next time she has a patient that has severe chest pain such as this, she needs to find the doctor to evaluate the patient ASAP.

You tell a tech to call the ECG tech overhead stating you need them immediately. They arrive and state they have already done that person's ECG, they have just been doing a few more before giving it to you for evaluation (the ECG is displayed below, there is no previous). You inform them that we are a chest pain center and that we are expected to have these ECGs performed and evaluated on all chest pain patients within 10 minutes of the patient's arrival to the ER. You then ask that they keep repeating ECGs every 20 minutes until they are told to stop. 

ECG #1:  https://i.imgur.com/56mmztR.jpg

The tech returns with the 2nd ECG (shown below), sighs, and states ""Do I really have to keep repeating ECGs every 20 minutes?"" You take a look at the ECG and state ""No, you need to do it every 15 minutes now until I tell you to stop."" (This was not punitive, the ECG was cause for significant concern). Meanwhile, the patient has had no relief with 3 sublingual nitroglycerins. You tell the nurse you are ordering 100mcg of fentanyl and starting the patient on a nitroglycerin drip with instructions to keep titrating up until either pain has completely resolved or the patient's SBP drops below 120 (current BP was 180/117). 

ECG #2: https://i.imgur.com/KSYmA5C.png

The tech then returns with the third ECG (shown below).

pharmacy,Why is the billing quantity of inhalers/unit of use drugs such a mess?,"I've seen the following methods to define a billing quantity:

* Grams (most inhalers)
* Milliliters (nebulizer solution and insulin)
* Doses (Anoro, Bydureon Pen, Advair Diskus)
* Unit of use box (Asmanex inhaler)
* Capsules (blister capsules inside Spiriva and Breo)

We get a few calls a month saying they were shorted because we bill in mL or whatever and the patient thinks ""15"" means 15 pens and not 15 mL, or ""90"" means nebulizer vials and not mL.

Why can't we simplify these? It makes some sense to bill insulins using mL, but why don't we bill by the pen? I think Lantus should be billed as 5 pens, because 1 pen is the smallest amount we could dispense. Likewise, nebulizer solutions should be billed by the vial instead bob by the mL. Why is Asmanex the only inhaler to be billed as Qty = 1, instead of the weight of the drug in grams like most of the other inhalers?",21,13,2018-03-20,PHARMA,0.026310240849852562,0.9358027577400208,0.03788701817393303

biotech,New Biotech and Science podcast: Update day 14,"Hello Everyone, 

It's been 14 days since I launched the ""Learning with Lowell"" podcast, and since then I have had a lot of feedback from people, which I've used to make the podcast better. One suggestion I received was to create a mailing list. I've been working on creating some sort of premium content to send out for each week since I wouldn't want to send just updates, but rather information, resources, and stuff from the podcasts that don't go into the show notes and could help others. I'm still open to input on what people would like. On another topic, I have really appreciated the kind remarks everyone has been making. Even the negative/criticism has helped me grow, and I want to say thank you to everyone for taking the time to do so. 

I've been working to get all of the data on the podcast, so I can update everyone with the numbers. Though I care less about the numbers vs how each of you are enjoying the episodes. I would much rather have 10 people who love what I'm doing over 1000 who tune in because they are bored, but then again who wouldn't! From what I can tell the podcast has had about a couple thousand downloads since the launch. I cannot tell if that is good or bad. It's something. I'd rather have a definite number.  A more useful metric is that across all platforms that I am currently on the podcast has about a dozen or so 5 star reviews. Thank you for everyone who took the time to write one. 

I'm currently booked to interview about 6-8 more people before the end of the month. If I were you I would expect more double episode weeks ;). Also, I was thinking of having a small lottery for listeners with prizes being books or resources that have been mentioned on the show thus far, or potentially meeting with a guest to ask them questions yourself. Let me know if this interests any of you. 

I also set up a Facebook and twitter page to better talk with listeners and people who love science related topics, so I'm here trying to update you all on my progress, see what you are all working on, and what you think of what I made thus far?

**Questions I have:**

*  What inspires you in the science and biotechnology fields?
*
*  What at do you think thus far?
* 
* Any improvements you would suggest?
* 
*  Who would you like to see on or have covered?
* 
* Where do you go to learn(magazines, online sites, etc)?

**The episodes:**

**Podcast Episode 013: Dr. Brandon Frenz of Cyrus biotechnology **

Short description: We discussion Protein engineering, and the latest advancements of Protein engineering. We go a little all over the place, but that is the main theme.
 ---

Brandon got his bachelors degree in biochemistry from Portland State University where he conducted research on mitochondria with Keith Garlid.  He received his PhD at the University of Washington in the Biochemistry department. He has since started working at Cyrus biotechnology in 2015 shortly after the company spun out of the Institute for Protein Design at UW (of which the DiMaio lab is part).  The goal of the company is to bring the powerful tools for protein structure prediction and design found in Rosetta to industry users in an easy to use fashion with back end cloud compute.

In this podcast he answers a lot of questions on the potential of protein engineering, how to be an evil scientist as seen in spy kids (or The novel the isle of doctor moreau) to create interesting organisms, where the field is going, and how each of us can help push the research forward.

**Podcast Episode 014: Bertrand Janin Chief Technical officer at Truveris.**

Short description: We discuss how he got into software development, his interests, and his passions.

The long description: 
Bertrand Janin Is the CTO at Truveris where he he has helped build their team from just himself to over 80 people.  He was originally inspired to get into programming from his love of games, and slowly built up his skills in coding and managing to the point where he is now a successful CTO. He hopes to one day hike the Appalachian mountains and believes he is immortal, and since I cannot disprove the latter without going to jail, we will have to take him at his word on that! We have a fun conversation that I'm sure you all are going to love! Let me know your thoughts.

medicine,Introducing /r/JuniorDoctorsUK a sub for UK doctors to talk.,"Hello /r/Medicine

Medical training in the UK is different from most places on earth. It requires frequent relocations, applications, exams and interviews, multiple memberships with different bodies and it is much longer than other places with many of us being ""Junior Doctors"" sometimes for 15 years post-qualification.
The UK is also currently in massive political turmoil affecting many doctors, between the new Junior Doctor contract, the looming Brexit, progressive NHS privatization, and Junior Doctors being struck off.

For all those reasons and many others, Doctors in the UK need a place to talk.
Facebook used to be this place. But with lack of anonymity and frequent reports of GMC investigations over seemingly benign Facebook posts, we need a new home.

**Introducing /r/JuniorDoctorsUK**

A place where doctors can share:


* Their workplace experience.

* Career progression and applications advice.

* Opinions on policies that affect their working lives.

* Interesting research and audits.

* Opportunities.

* Funny and relatable posts.

* or anything else...

I also hope for/r/JuniorDoctorsUK to become a sort of crowd-sourced ultimate resource for people in our profession with our growing [Wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JuniorDoctorsUK/wiki/index) that is/will be covering aspects specific to our lives nowhere to be found online. 
I also expect that new opportunities will be created (nation-wide research/audits, multi-center collaborations, community projects/research/polls etc..), and that long lasting change will start here (policies, frameworks, ideas..).


This subreddit is brand new and mostly empty, and UK doctors are notoriously rare on reddit and shy online, for fear of repercussions. Please consider joining and spreading the word to your colleagues to help our community grow and make its way online to a place we can express ourselves freely, and turn it into something awesome.

Hey, if you’re not a doctor, or not from the UK you’re more than welcome to join us, share your opinions, or ask questions!

pharmacy,We need to teach a class on how insurance works,"This has now happened to both my Australian born roommate and one of my HIV patients at the pharmacy.  When HR sends out the email to pick out insurance, anyone with a middle class income gravitates towards the cheapest plan possible.  No one reads what it means to have a bottom tier plan, all they see is how much per month they have to pay.  My HIV patient had a Bronze level plan that gave him a $4000 deductible and 10% copay after that.  So when I ran his medications, there was nothing under $200, with several being over $1000. Needless to say, he was shocked.  My roommate had it even worse, as it was a minimal basic plan that did not cover any meds and only covered $100 on any other issue.  And she wound up with cysts that required an $80k surgery.  She had to go back to Australia for the surgery.  If someone had just explained to either one of these people how deductibles and a percentage based copay works, there's no way that plan would be chosen.

Instead, I have to sit down with this poor HIV patient and tell him he needs to tell his HR rep that this insurance plan will destroy his income, which means he may have to disclose his HIV status.  And explain why a generic cholesterol medication, when it doesn't go through insurance, is $15 and when it does, is $57.  Felt so bad for the guy.

Maybe part of it is that manipulation on its own really doesn't hold up (which I generally agree with), and its benefit is not on its own, but usually when paired with other treatments it acts synergistic effect. 

&gt; Anyway, a good place to start is [Bronfort et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18164469).  The examiners compared 24 different interventionsI believe the link i have for you is in reference to only one of the parts. They found that manipulation alone was superior to placebo, superior to NSAIDS, similar to NSAIDS + exercise. Which presents us one of your follow up questions, of risk vs benefit. To me the net gain is there since NSAIDS carry their own risks which also range from minor to fatal, which I'm sure your aware of as pharmD. 

&gt; For pediatric research; good research is really rare. There is a lot of safety research, suggesting that pediatric adjusting is extremely safe, such as Vohra et al.. However clinical efficacy research is largely practice based research which usually lacks repeat-ability and suffers from bias. Here is the first study that to me finally looks like a solid [randomized trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730742/), but they haven't published their data yet.

&gt; In all, lack of research is a major problem that I see with my profession, and to get a sizable amount of good data and research is considerably costly, thus its slow to occur. In general only the chiropractic colleges can really afford to do so and the political fighting that occurs within these organizations makes it even harder. So instead most ""research"" are really just case reviews or small scale CBR. Both can easily create bias to either opinion. 

&gt; I'm happy to answer any other questions you may have, even about the profession in general. A lack of understanding and communication between the traditional medical community and chiropractic I believe has created a lot of fear on both sides and causes patients to ultimately be the victims. Unfortunately generally the largest voices in the Chiropractic community usually represents a very small but vocal group that generally runs against the profession's attempts to modernize and integrate.

pharmacy,"For minor issues, do you hunt down the offender or fix it and move on?","I'm about to finish pharmacy school and have noticed that there seem to be two schools of thought on handling minor issues such as crooked labels, bottles not being Xed, typos in sigs, etc.  Some pharmacists try to figure out the specific technician who did whatever the offensive thing was and some will just make a blanket announcement like ""hey guys please be remember to X the bottles"" and ask the nearest technician to fix the issue.  

My thought is that unless it's a potentially serious problem like a misfill then I don't really need to know specifically who did it.  As an intern and tech I never really minded recounting something or fixing a crooked label or or retyping a garbled sig even if I wasn't the one who messed up.  I can see why figuring out the offender would be helpful if it became clear that one person was consistently doing something wrong, but I figure everyone puts a label on crooked or types ""daily"" as ""dialy"" every once in a while and it's not a huge deal.

medicine,Question regarding what is typical of a practice,"This is from a throwaway account.

I'm a subspecialty ICU physician and started my first job in 8/2016.  I'm currently at the largest hospital in my state.  It's a private hospital.  It's on the east coast.

I'm frustrated because my colleagues are just lazy.  Physicians will typically leave the unit and likely the hospital after rounding very superficially.  APC's are frustrated as well as they're left to run an ICU.  I'm constantly playing clean-up...with families and with practicing medicine.  There is very little attempt to diagnose patients that require more than five minutes of thought, but more a push to support vital signs until they can be moved to our associate floor service.  Diltiazem gtt's are started because ""fast HR = dilt gtt"" rather than ever bothering to question what the rhythm is or if the pt is septic.  Relationships with pt's families are dismal and other physicians are generally annoyed by them - palliative care consults are usually placed to even have the discussion that a family member is going to die.  Other physicians would wait on the door from the parking lot into the hospital to tell me ""nothing new with anyone, goodbye!"" so they could leave faster and I would generally be greeted by frustrated nurses and chaos.

My concern is that I've spoken to multiple more experienced travel nurses and have been told that most private hospitals are some degree of this bad.  I went to a well-regarded residency and fellowship program and have options open...however, I don't want to get suckered into something again.  2/3rds of my shifts have been moved to the night shift - at first, I thought I was helping out because our unit director has meetings during the day, but later found it's because they're getting paid x2 for (poorly) covering our service #1 (primary) and #2 (stepdown, new pt's, outliers).  My spending habits haven't changed since fellowship.  Is this really true of other practices?  How do I spot poor places?  When I interviewed, where I'm at looked great.  Is there a way to fix the program I'm at?  I really like the rest of the hospital and am afraid I'll burn everyone else in my group by trying to fix this - which might be justified, but still I need to get a job somewhere else.  I love what I do, but it's getting hard to come into work because I get to start each shift with a couple hours of family updates after trying to fix what was missed during the day.  Our MD's are generally looked down upon by our surgical counterparts because others are not trustworthy.

the question comes  routinely from absolutely every relative every time
""did he/she have a peaceful death?"" or ""did he/she suffer?""
the attending who it seems is a big fan of buddhism and quotes buddha all the time and said that he is a big proponent of the concept of ""direct speech"", so more or less telling things how they are, bare of emotions and truthfully(no euphemisms etc.). but he said this is the only question where he says ""yes, he/she died peacfully in their sleep"" no matter how it really was.
this took me by surprise because like him or maybe even more, I always was unknowling a big proponent of direct speech and even took pride in being know for frank and authentic conversations with my patients.  but this conversation got me thinking. what good does it do especially in the described situation to tell them how it really was. it will change nothing for the dead patient who i want to be truthful for but everything for the relative.

Leo is the founder of Neural analytics a company that is building technology that can let physicians and techs get past the skull of the brain without surgery or anything like that, and tell if you have traumatic brain damage, stroke, or any number of things. This is a life saver, and I cannot wait to see Leo develop his company in the coming years. In this episode we go into the technology, into Leo’s and his company’s story, and get extremely detailed into the process of starting a biotech company. Anyone even remotely interested in biotech companies should check this episode out since we do a great job at demystifying the process and having fun while doing it.

pharmacy,Coworkers are making fun of my lazy eye.,"So I have a lazy eye; have had it all my life. Generally it's fine if i'm focusing but when I relax it can go out of sync and drift off. It also causes my vision to be less than stellar to I typically close the lazy eye when i'm verifying. Sometimes I even use a provided magnifying glass the old pharmacists use (in my late 20's).

After one of my shifts I forgot something and turned back to go into into the pharmacy when I overheard the PIC and the techs talking about my lazy eye/vision and audibly laughing.

Since then I've been more aware and have noticed anytime I correct a prescription/reprimand anyone on mistakes they close one eye and stare at each other and smile.

I know i shouldnt let this effect me but it places me right back into my younger years when I was bullied over it... never thought this would rear it's ugly head in a professional setting of all places.",27,74,2018-03-28,PHARMA,0.09869769215583801,0.8733150959014893,0.02798721380531788

pharmacy,What is the best way to verify a prescription.,"So I have been a pharmacist for about 7 months now and I am finally getting comfortable in my position.

I break up reading the drug by reading the name and then reading the strength and dosage form. Next, I look at the quantity, origin code, written date, and refills, briefly. I read the directions of the drug once and if the directions are complicated, I read multiple times.

medicine,PSA: contaminated spice (synthetic cannabinoids) originating in Chicago,"In short, there's been an outbreak of contaminated spice originating in Chicago. It appears to have been adulterated with brodifacoum, which is a super-long-acting warfarin-like anticoagulant previously used as rat poison.

It can be treated with vitamin K, though often requires between 40-100mg/day (or more) to keep INR &lt;2.

medicine,Switching residencies - what is the right way to do it?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a medicine resident currently and looking to change specialties. I’ve done well and have good evaluations but I stopped enjoying the workflow and types of problems I’m seeing. At my hospital gen med is treated as a “dumping ground” and it’s starting to wear on me quite a bit. I’d much rather be doing something procedural and “hands on” (versus most of my work being typing on a computer), so I’m thinking about going into surgery. I was on the fence between medicine and surgery, and cultivated some mentors in surgery who I’ve lost touch with as I was heading into medicine. It feels awkward to try to reach back to them, but it feels like something I should do. Has anyone done anything like this and can share what the process was like for you, and if you had any specific advice?",36,33,2018-03-29,PHARMA,0.09078428149223328,0.8731186389923096,0.036097027361392975

medicine,Sternal rub in clinical practice - do we still use it?,"I recently completed an internal training course at my hospital on falls which covered how to correctly do a GCS; one of the biggest surprises I heard was that sternal rub has been strongly discouraged since the 1970s! Luckily for me I always opted for the trap squeeze in clinical practice.

The GCS website confirms this (http://www.glasgowcomascale.org/whats-new/), but not how long this recommendation has been in place.

Therefore I was hoping someone might know:

1. How long has this been the case? i.e. is it really a recommendation from the 1970s?
2. Is there another indication to use sternal rub? i.e. GCS is for assessing consciousness but is sternal rub for actively trying to wake someone from a reduced consciousness?

Was looking on a certain job hunting site and saw a position for staff pharmacist as being available at my pharmacy. This position is filled. Staff pharmacist has no plans on leaving. **It has been posted for a month.** Recently a newly hired pharmacist came into our store to introduce themselves.

They pushing myschedule and other things that we simply do not have the staff or ability to meet. Tomorrow our ""demand"" hours are 0. You read that right. We are open from 10-6. Optimization is in the shitter of course.

Our weekly warehouse orders haven't been completely put away even a week later. Cycle counts for non controls are all changed to zero so we know medications will be ordered automatically for people. We only pull outdates/soon expiring meds when we see them. There are stacks upon stacks of prescriptions hiding in various nooks that have not been filed because we have been so behind. Every day this past week we have had 99+ prescriptions past due for most of the day. I wish we would get audited so the company can accrue massive fines. No overtime either, lol. Techs written up for having sealable, transparent water bottles in the pharmacy. Doesn't stop corporate from yelling at us, mainly the PIC, about all of the above.

PIC got an email about us not meeting company expectations. Probably the lack of PCQ calls being made, right?
