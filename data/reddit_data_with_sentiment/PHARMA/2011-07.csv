Health,"Some questions about a really, REALLY gross medical condition.","A few days ago while reading an IAmA, someone left [a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/i8dhu/update_with_photosi_am_from_a_dying/c21rjzl?context=3) in which I first heard of a street drug that's being used more and more commonly in Russia, they call it ""krokodil"". It's a heroin substitute made from codeine pills you can buy OTC(!) there. It's so loaded with toxic impurities, the flesh around the injection sites quickly starts rotting away. Addicts that use krokodil every day rarely live more than 2-3 years.

Of course, after reading about it my curiosity was piqued and I Googled it. I found a video of one addict that just left me...⊙_⊙

➡**EXTREMELY GROSS AND DISTURBING! This video is probably NSFW. NSFL. Be prepared to possibly puke. May cause nightmares. ☣You've been warned!☣**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REP6NCDfAtg

If you don't have the stomach to watch the video, it shows a young male junkie in some sort of medical clinic or hospital. He's in a wheelchair and both feet are bandaged. The doctor starts on his right foot first, which is swollen and discolored. The toes are black. (Gangrene?) He cuts off the gauze and reveals large holes rotted into the bottom of the foot. He swabs some dark thin liquid on them, then the video goes to the doctor getting ready to take care of the left foot.

This leg is encased in a thick layer of plastic wrap. The doctor cuts that off and we see what must be the stuff of nightmares. A few inches below the knee, the flesh on the guy's leg has rotted completely through. A few inches of the fibula and tibia are exposed and literally ""bone dry"". The rest of his calf and his foot are a huge mass of putrid flesh that looks very soft and squishy and appears to be melting off the bones. The doctor uses some sort of wire to amputate the guy's foot, he just cut the bones below where the knee flesh has healed closed, and there is a couple inches of bone left sticking out.

 -How long would it take for a person's leg to rot away like that?

 -How did the guy not die from infection?!

 -Could it possibly be hazardous if his leg was just left with a few inches of bone protruding from below the knee?

 -Would the doctors have deliberately allowed his leg to rot that much or could it have been the addict himself who wrapped it in plastic until it became so putrid?

It wasn't the visual that made me feel like throwing up so much as imagining the horrible stench that must have had. Ew.

Yeah. Drugs are bad, mmmkay?

Health,Has Anyone Had MRSA IN or NEAR Their Eye?,"My husband has frequent battles with MRSA.  Before we met, he battled with horrible, disfiguring acne for almost 15 years.  Acne, and giant boils all over his body from time to time.
When we met he was going through a fairly clear period, but shortly after we moved in together he got a couple boils which I immediately said MRSA!  Took him to a dermatologist, and confirmed, yep, MRSA.

He has since gone to several docs, had several cultures, and taken all kinds of antibiotics.  I don't know how docs his whole life missed it, but it must have such a hold in his system he can't flush it. 

On to today.  Last week above his eye got a little bump, which over the last few days has turned into a quail egg size knot of hot festering goodness.  I know it must be MRSA, I started him 3 days ago on his backup bottle of antibiotics and we are going to try to wait until Tues to see the DR.

QUESTION IS:  Has anyone else had it near their eye?  What are the things I should be scared of, what could happen?  I want to try to make him to go the ER in the am if it's not any smaller because I don't want him going blind....

Health,no common cause for heartburn trigger....advice?,"ok so i've been suffering bouts of high stomach acidity for years now.  Usually when it does happen i get sharp pains in stomach when i swallow food, so i get some form of heartburn/gerd type medicine from PCP. Within past few months I got a endoscope of my stomach and all was normal.  More recently now I've been having to deal with heartburn for no reason. My diet is the same (healthy mostly), lifestyle is same, physically fit, dont smoke, drink little, etc.  

So I cannot find what triggers my bouts with heartburn.  I've played games all day with a buddy of mine drinking nothing but soda (dr.pepper)  and be ok. I go to the gym, workout my legs out and do my normal food routine(protein shake, 2 meals before bed) and be ok.  Next day I do same thing again but do my back routine and at night around 10-11 I get killer heartburn.  I went out on Friday night, ate greasy mexican and had a couple beers ZERO problems. One night i workout my arms, same food routine and 10-11 I get heartburn.  Last night had some pizza w/ soda (mt.dew) and BAM heartburn.

Health,Is it possible to be allergic to food in general? (and a more bizarre story/question inside),"For a couple years now I've had a very strange problem. Apparently at random I'll find myself beset with terrible fatigue and weakness. That is worrying, but alone I would have let it go after a few visits to the doctor and the diagnoses that ""I'm healthy as can be."" (Except for lyme disease a few years back, but I was treated for it so I should be fine.) Usually I can shake off the fatigue with a force of effort, so I've been inclined to view it as just ""one of those things.""

What I have not been able to let go is what happens to my mind. Sometimes concurrently with the fatigue, but oftentimes not, I find thinking to be very difficult. The typically fluid meanderings of thoughts becomes sluggish, inflexible, and energy intensive. When I'm feeling fine I can grasp new concepts easily and immediately apply them, when I'm in one of these episodes concepts that I've known well become illusive and hard to wield. 

Seemingly related, when I play sports I find myself reacting late as my mind fails to process what is going on efficiently. This is a different phenomenon from ""reflexes"" as it applies to things like tennis, where judging the placement, spin, and location of an opponent's shot is more a function of synthesizing data than it is a knee-jerk reaction.

Doctors seem to think I'm fine, and I don't blame them. I'm otherwise a very healthy guy and describing these symptoms with little ability to provide evidence is difficult. However, the more I've lived with these problems the more I think there is really something wrong. The force of will it requires to complete or begin tasks that I usually even enjoy (tennis, rock-climbing, math) is enormous. Even simple tasks can seem daunting, and the inability to think clearly is downright terrifying at times.

I've wondered about many possible causes from the mundane (gluten intolerance) to the odd (like low testosterone), which led me to wonder if it could just be food in general. I often wake up feeling fine and not long after breakfast feel terrible. 

(Didn't intend for this to be so long.)

Has anyone else experienced or witnessed something similar?

Health,"What the hell bit me, and what should I do about it? (pics included!)","Hi /r/Health, it's my first time using this subreddit, so if I'm committing some terrible faux pas just tell me and I'll try and fix it up.

I have red spots with brown/black centers across my lower body, extending up to my waist. They're most-concentrated around the fronts of my shins. In terms of size, they range from slightly smaller than penny-sized to about quarter-sized. They first appeared on the 6th (3 days ago) and looked like mosquito bites, but have since grown larger &amp; darker.

I'm fairly certain that whatever caused this occurred on the 5th (4 days ago), when I took a trip to a friend's lake house in rural Kansas, near Ottawa. At one point I was using a friend's natural ""herbal"" insect repellent on my legs. I think that this either A) did not repel any insects at all, or B) caused some sort of allergic reaction. I was, however, wearing jeans at the time, so I find it odd that the marks span across areas that were definitely covered while I was outside.

I've so far been assuming these were mosquito bites and haven't really been concerned, but in my experience mosquito bites would have gradually faded by now, whereas these have only gotten worse. I'm still not terribly concerned, but if it's something serious I'd like to catch it early.

I also took some pics for you! Excuse the poor lighting, a photographer I am not.

**EDIT:** Thought I should probably mention, these do itch pretty nasty. I've been making an effort to not scratch them, though, so that's not what's caused them to get worse.

**EDIT NUMBER TWO: Alright, I'm going to wait a day and then go see a doctor.** I want to see if it gets better at all before shelling out some mad ducats to go to the doc. The most popular answer so far seems to be chiggers. Sounds possible, but I've had chiggers before and they itch a good bit worse than this (these do itch though).

Health,"Not really looking for medical advice, per se, just kind of curious.. (Dermatology?)","23, female. I have these small, sort of pimple-like spots on my legs and have had them ever since I can remember, at least since puberty. They don't itch, hurt, or negatively impact my life in any way, so I see no real reason to spend the money to go to a doctor. I'm just kind of curious as to what they are and figured here might be an alright place to ask for theories.

They're small, dark red, no pus or anything. Like the small spots people get on their faces. They're only on the front of my lower legs/shins, probably about 20-30 per leg centered under the knee to halfway down the shin, with the odd spot above and below. They're there whether I've shaved recently or not, whether I've exfoliated or not, whether I moisturize or not. The rest of my body is spot-free, excluding the occasional normal spot on my face.

As a result of this I haven't worn shorts or bathing suits in years, but maybe that's making it worse since I wear jeans most of the time? I dunno.

Sorry if this isn't allowed by the way, I know the advice is generally 'just go to the doctor!' but this doesn't seem to be anything dangerous, and as I said, it hasn't impacted my life/health negatively in any way, so I would have a hard time justifying paying a doctor for something so insignificant.

Any ideas why they're there? And any ideas if there's anything I can do to get rid of them? I don't really care if there isn't, but it'd be a nice bonus!

What can I do?,"**TL;DR: I suspect that I may have some serious illness, but have no insurance coverage and have no money to cover an initial doctor's appointment yet alone an ongoing course of medical action for cancer or other serious illness. What do I do?**

Context below

I live in Los Angeles now after graduating from college about a year ago. I have lived a pretty typical life including excessive amounts of whatever happens in college. I picked the wrong major (Art History) and ended up working at a dead end, no pay job for a long time until I managed to land a marketing internship at an advertising agency. I get paid, which is good but I have no benefits. I would get benefits from blue cross blue shield through work if they decide to hire me as a fulltime employee but I have no guarantee that will happen.

I started the internship around June 1 and since then have been experiencing head pain (does not seem like the pain from a headache) that doesnt make me feel too bad but tends to reoccur in specific locations and recently has left me feeling a little bit ""off"" but really only after 8 hours in front of a computer for work. My glasses perscription seems to be adequate and my eyesight hasnt changed in a few years.
I also have a hip that I hurt running on a treadmill a few months ago that hasnt gotten better with rest but only really hurts when I am lying down on my back with no support for my leg. I also have been having some digestion issues that also havent been alievated by trying not to eat food that is too spicy or irritating but has gotten a little better lately.

My father's side of the family seems to have a history with cancer and my brother won a fight with brain cancer a few years ago and I thank FSM that he is around. I really really really cant help but think that these health issues might be linked to cancer. However, I have no issurance and I earn fucking nothing. I have no savings and my family lives in New York. I am fairly certain that whatever health insurance that my mom has was comprehensive enough that my brother's cancer was covered, but i have no idea what kind it is, if it covers me, if it extends out of state, etc. I am currently operating under the assumption that it wont cover me, but that may change when I do more digging into what it exactly the coverage is.

I am going to the doctor later today for a physical and some blood work because my GF was kind enough to figure out something, but what then? If I need an MRI? That shit costs thousands of dollars out of pocket. If I am diagnosed? Surgery? Radiation? Chemo? Scrips? Thats thousands of dollars that I have no possible way of coming up with.

So, what are my options?",38,15,2011-07-12,PHARMA,0.06043281778693199,0.9025474190711975,0.037019696086645126

Health,Question on Vitamin Supplements,"For the last few weeks I have been researching vitamin and supplements and I seem to get a lot of confliction. I had watched a nutrition documentary where some Drs and health nuts suggested high volumes of vitamin; more than recommended on the label will in fact help most people with their daily problems. While they had many sound arguments they did make a claim that, I believe 10,000mg of C will help cure cancer. On that I am skeptical, but many articles state that vitamins can help with things such as depression.

On the other side of the argument the opponents mention over dosing on vitamins. Overdosing appears to take serious effort and the side-effects are generally not terrible. I had an experience as a child with too much iron that turned my teeth black temporarily. I’m sure it’s a matter of finding a balance.

So my question is, what are some experiences people had with vitamin supplements and taking higher doses? My plan is to use the supplements until I can improve my culinary talents and expand my taste to include more nutritious food.",9,11,2011-07-12,PHARMA,0.03297412022948265,0.9175366163253784,0.04948919638991356
Health,Why is my body working against me?,"I have a number of chronic health problems that I have been dealing with for years (hypothyroidism, anemia and bipolar disorder), for the first time I feel that they are all under control. So my new goal has been to get into shape (less than two years ago I fell into the ""obese"" category on the bmi index, I am now just ""over weight"" and am working toward a healthy weight). I have been doing indoor rock climbing for over a year now and started biking over a month ago. I have really been enjoying biking and despite some knee pain, have been having little to no problems. 
However, as of Saturday night, my right arm started to really hurt and I can't figure out why, now both do and I haven't been doing much physical activity since Saturday because of my right arm. I can't even figure out what triggered it, all I did Saturday was work my retail job for a few hours, then out of nowhere, I had pain and it hasn't subsided three days later. Why is my body working against me? I just want to be healthy?

Don't ask why I haven't been to a doctor, I live in Ontario, Canada and we have a doctor shortage, therefore, I don't have a family doctor. I was seeing one at my community college, but school is out and the doctor is gone. I could go to a walk-in-clinic but I feel I just sit there for three to four hours and then I'm seen by someone who doesn't give a shit and usually gives advice like ""wait it out and come back next week"".",12,8,2011-07-12,PHARMA,0.0963195264339447,0.8657383322715759,0.03794218599796295

I had a quick question. I'm a premedical student, and I'm in an internship this summer where financial planning workshops are being offered. Looking at the numbers here, I have started getting a tad bit stressed out. For me to complete my undergrad and then MD, I will probably have to take substantial loans (~200k). Has anybody had to take this amount of loans out before? Do you find that within some of the lower paid specialties, you struggle more?

I guess my hope is to hear that it is not as hard as it really sounds.. Any advice?


Ps. I am looking at the following three fields as of now: Emergency or trauma surgery, Internal Medicine, or general surgery.

Health,I have low blood cholesterol - could I swap blood with a girl at work with high blood cholesterol and the same blood type?,"My title may sound a little crazy, but I didn't know how to write a decent short title.

I have hypobetalipoproteinemia, or in other words - very low blood cholesterol due to a genetic defect.  It is insanely low - 25-40 is typical (120-200 is a typical range).  In high school, my doctor put me on a ""hot dog and cheeseburger diet"" (his words) to both gain weight and raise my cholesterol (I also have minor G.I./liver issues, so metabolize foods poorly, and am very thin as well).  The highest my cholesterol got on this diet was ~70, but it quickly went down after I started eating like a normal human.

My only other major problem is depression right now (although I risk lots of other problems in the coming years).  This is apparently common in the small # of people with low cholesterol, and drugs do not help (the 10,000 calorie high fat diet did help some).

So, a couple weeks ago I learned that a girl at work has familial hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol).  She is very thin due to her rigid low fat diet, exercises frequently, takes cholesterol lowering drugs, yet has a cholesterol level in the high 200's (it was in the high 300's before drug/diet intervention).  This has been in her family for decades.  Her great-grandfather and grandfather both died in their 40's, her dad had his first heart attack in his mid-20's (now in his early 40's in horrible health), and she is now 25 and scared.  

So, when she was telling me this, she also mentioned her blood type ... which is the same as mine.  Here's my dumb/crazy question - could we ""swap blood"" to an extent?  I need more cholesterol, she needs less.  Seems like a mutually beneficial arrangement, right?",12,6,2011-07-14,PHARMA,0.07065042108297348,0.9030976891517639,0.02625192515552044

medicine,A Serious Question About Our Current Understanding Of Thyroid Function,"**My hypothesis is this**: The current state of understanding on how thyroid hormone and dysfunction of the thyroid affects quality of life is poor. I will also qualify that statement and say that I think the sort of ""popular dissatisfaction"" with current treatment has also lead a lot of people to reach conclusions that are wrong. There's a lot of published quackery on thyroid disorders. My conclusion is that we don't know enough yet despite over a century of using thyroid hormone replacement, and strangely few people seem to be looking for answers.

**Background**: I have autoimmune thyroiditis (aka Hashimoto's), and about 3 years ago had a partial thyroidectomy on suspicion of papillary thyroid carcinoma. I have half a thyroid and take synthroid to treat hypothyroidism. I'm 24.

Upon observation of or discussion with people with thyroid disease, even when treated properly, you'll notice something interesting: they almost all complain of lingering fatigue and, in many cases, difficulty maintaining the same weight they had before the disease got them to the point of hypothyroidism and they sought treatment. This dissatisfaction leads many people to seek out alternatives, leading them to popular quackery about ""natural"" alternatives to Synthroid like dessicated pig thyroid. My research into papers published on the matter confirms that there appears to be no significant sustained benefit.

In my case, since the surgery I've been progressively tweaking my thyroid dosage to attempt to get it to an optimal point where I feel... normal. Like I did before.

I started out simply taking Synthroid, but wasn't particularly satisfied with that so I tried various T3/T4 combinations using both Synthroid and Cytomel. None were particularly satisfying, although the Cytomel supplied better peaks and worse valleys than straight Synthroid - my conclusion is that, qualitatively, people like dessicated thyroid because of its T3 content, which temporarily makes you feel almost ""high"" in an unnatural way that is somewhat psychologically addictive.

I've since switched back to Synthroid by itself and have reached a near-stable dose, with tweaks here and there depending on both bloodwork and how I feel. My philosophy has been that, within the band of bloodwork results considered to be ""normal"" (TSH, T4), it's okay to tweak your dosage to feel as optimal as possible without artificially suppressing TSH down to levels that would be dangerous to cardiac health. Because I don't have a good baseline on what levels would be normal for *me* vs. what is normal for a person on average, this seems to be a reasonable approach. I try to prevent overmedication by ensuring I never drop below the lower bounds of ""normal"" TSH.

Over the last 2 years essentially I've slowly moved up in dosage in half-increments (i.e. first alternating between .88 and .100 each day before moving up to .100 to get finer granularity. This is possible because of the long half-life). I've observed a few things during this time.

First, taking artificial T4 orally seems to affect different organs in different ways. I find that getting to level where my workout performance is optimal tends to affect my brain in such a way that I feel somewhat overstimulated.

However, given that, I used to be an anxious person - my thoughts used to race, sometimes keeping me up all night as I contemplated things like death and that stressful exam coming up back when I was in school. Now I rarely feel particularly anxious, and I rarely experience insomnia. A side-effect of that is that I feel like the speed at which I am able to solve problems is diminished.

Ultimately, there seems to be no level that feels completely ""normal"". The only method I've found that truly gets me to near-normal for short periods of time is intense cardiovascular exercise, but if I go even a few days without it I start to again feel sub-optimal. I'm perfectly willing to use this as a solution for now, but I've seen some interesting synthesis of available research that confirms that we don't fully understand what's going on. 

There's a great paper that was published in the journal Labmedicine in June 2010 called ""The Challenges and Complexities of Thyroid Hormone Replacement"". It's essentially a meta-study on research around treatment options and dives a little bit into recent biological research around how T4 finds its way into various types of cells. Some general conclusions (I highly recommend you read the paper):

* A lot of people really do complain of lingering fatigue... it doesn't seem like it's a purely psychosomatic phenomenon
* There was no *sustained* improvement noted in supplementing with a T3/T4 combo over straight T4. Any benefit observed at the start of treatment quickly vanished after about a month of treatment, or about how long it takes for hormone levels to stabilize after a change in dosage.
* Biologically, T4 taken orally seems to affect various organ tissues in an unequal fashion and may not completely mimic the function of the thyroid gland.

**The question**: Can anyone who has studied endocrinology shed some more light on the state of research? Where do you think we need to go from here? Do you think there's validity to thinking about supplementing T4 treatment with other medications to superficially address lingering concerns (for example, using modafinil to treat symptoms of lingering fatigue as one might treat shift work syndrome) as a standard treatment option?

pharmacy,(I have a feeling this is the right subreddit for this.) I'm dyslexic and I have symptoms of VS (Visual Snow) and I'm not sure what kind of medicine to take for it (if any). I think I could really use some help on this. [Details Inside],"Here's the story (sorry in advance if it's a little lengthy): 

About 2 years ago I developed the symptoms for VS immediately *during* marijuana use, I didn't notice it at the time but in hindsight I remember. I noticed these visual symptoms with my second experience with the drug and again later with my third and fourth experiences with it. I think I smoked marijuana about 10 times total within a 6 month period.

(The visual symptoms I noticed are the following: ""snowy"" or ""static"" vision, ""halos"" (transparent outlines) around objects, ""patterns"" (such as stripes on clothing or repeating carpet designs) appear to ""stand out"" or ""wiggle"" somehow (In sort of the same way as [this](http://data.whicdn.com/images/1494783/tumblr_kx0vudxfPD1qzt4vjo1_500_thumb.gif?1266079406) picture.), the snow makes the day and night seem brighter; in the dark there's millions of tiny bright ""sparkles"" and in the day the colours of the world seem more ""potent"" now.  

Also, I'm reluctant to admit it to any ""doctor"", but I would often get high in a wooded area. Now I feel extremely magnetised to plants in general. I use to look at trees as objects; like you would a doll or statue or rock. Now I feel strange when I'm around them. They feel more alive, more aware, then I thought of them previously. I feel that they ""feel my presence"" when I'm around, sensing me as I walk past; if the trees had eyes they'd follow me. That said, it really isn't the ""whole plant"" that's aware, but rather the plants seem like cities or colonies where some areas are more ""aware"" than others.

Anyway, I originally thought I had HPPD so I abstained from all drug usage for two years, fast-forward two years and I still have most of the symptoms minus the halos around objects.  

Recently I've been investigating the issue.

I went to a Psychologist who referred me to a Neurologist who suggested I get an MRI &amp; EEG (*normal*) who then referred me to a Psychiatrist. I haven't yet gone to see a psychiatrist because I'm afraid all he can do is prescribe medications and, seeing that the source of these visual disturbances has not been identified, I'm assuming that any medication I'm given is just going to fuck me up even more. Which I guess is where you guys come in. 

In my opinion, it's also worth noting that a month or so prior to my first experiment with marijuana I had been using the NRI drug Strattera. Which I also had an adverse reaction to; violent/ suicidal thoughts, feeling trapped within my own skin, impotence, goosebumps or ""crawling"" sensations on the skin. One day, in the period of time where I had quit taking the drug, I felt like a bag of happiness had burst inside my head and I felt *extremely euphoric* until I slept off the euphoria (which I didn't want to do).

Also, when under the effects of weed I felt my reaction was atypical as well; I would feel as though I could only experience every-other sensation, as if I were caught In a strobe light. At the time I described the experience as ""moving on pegboard"". This experience persisted for two days after the ""high"" wore off.  

Anyway, that's *two* relatively negative reactions to psychotropic drugs, and I'm worried that further experimentation by a psychiatrist will only exacerbate whatever chemical imbalances I may or may not have. 

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me, I will answer all questions I am asked.

Health,Rectal Bleeding - How much blood is life threatening - Freaked out right now!,"In December, I experienced rectal bleeding after I found that my stool was very hard. Fresh blood passed every time I went to the toilet and there was severe pain. I thus changed my diet (had more fibre and  a lot more water) and realised that after a week or so that I no longer had a problem. I presumed that what I was experiencing was an anal fissure.

About 2 months later, after eating 3 days of fast food I experienced another case of rectal bleeding, but this time the stool wasn't hard. This lasted a few days then stopped.

Again around a month or so later I experienced the same thing, but this time I felt that my diet or water habits hadn't changed dramatically. This time I felt the urgent need to go the toilet, but again fresh blood passed, and after a few days or so everything went back to normal.

This brings me to the last few days. I've felt a more regular need to use the toilet (at least twice a day). Tonight though there wasnt any particular hard stool, but when I flushed the toilet I realised that there  was blood on the toilet seat and that there must have been blood in my stool. I also swear that I saw some mucus in there.

Now I know what your going to say.: I should have seen a doctor a long time ago. I just thought the problem was with my diet and wasnt that serious. After today though I definitely will consult with a doctor.

However this is where my dilemma lies: I don't know how much blood there was tonight. I thought it was more than a teaspoon but not quite sure how much.  After reading loads of articles that say that heavy blood loss can be life threatening, and that the symptoms I should expect to see is dizziness, weakness etc. I think I may have these symptoms or just be having a panic attack.

I guess what my question is therefore: How much blood would i have had to have lost to make this life threatening, and how soon would I notice this within?

Health,What's wrong with me?,"This happens to me every couple of months, and from the research I've done it seems that the most likely culprit is Simple Partial Seizures, but I wanted to ask if any of you had any similar experiences.

It just happens randomly, and often frequently in succession, but not often. I think the last time it happened was maybe 3 months ago, but it's started again and it scares me.

Everything seems normal, but then I suddenly get the feeling that I have never been in the place and experiencing it for the very first time, even though it is somewhere I am very familiar with. I've read up and discovered that this is called 'jamais vu'. Then, I get this sudden, intense feeling of complete dread and my heart starts racing. Then I feel like I am in a dream. The world kind of drifts out of focus around me, and I get that feeling when you remember a dream, but just barely before it fades from your memory again. I also experience memory loss when this happens and can't remember what I was in the process of doing.

Does anyone have any idea what this is, what's causing it, or how to fix it? It's really starting to bother me that it keeps happening more frequently, and for longer periods of time. It's been happening on and off for the last hour and a half now.

Health,How to effectively treat HPV for around 10-15 dollars.,"HPV is very common and easy to spread. It generally lives inside your urinary tract and some strains causes warts.

If you don't have insurance and you want to treat HPV, then read on. Notice that this won't cure you or stop you from passing it to other people. Wear condoms kiddies. If you're a young female please get an HPV shot before you start having sex!  Females have much more to lose than males and are harder to treat.

Everything you need to treat HPV is at the grocery store, and actually fairly cheap.

1. Buy some Apple Cider Vinegar. Yup, that's right. ACV for your HPV. This will run you anywhere from 2-5 dollars depending if you buy the organic stuff. You'll notice it basically contains 5 percent acid content.

*Make sure the Vinegar is unfiltered and unpasteurized. Per glowinthedark. This might mean you need to buy the organic stuff which is a bit more expensive.

2. Wet band-aids or cotton balls. You can go cheap or expensive here and spend anywhere from 3-6 bucks. It's up to you. I suggest the wet ready band-aids.

3. Lysine vitamins. This is basically your secret weapon in the fight against an incurable virus. This will be more expensive and will run you 5-7 dollars, but it's worth it as they are the easiest to deal with.


Now to treat yourself:

Use a Q-tip to apply ACV to the pad portion of the bandaid. Soak it good and apply the bandaid to the wart area. Leave it on for around 45-60 min at a time. I would suggest twice a day. You can also use cotton balls and some surgical tape but it's a bit more awkward. Either way, it will sting a little but its nowhere near as bad as what the doctor will do to you.

If you go to a doctor or clinic they are basically going to do the same thing but with stronger acid. When they burn off warts though they will take a lot of your skin with it and cause serious burns. It can take up to a month for it to heal. With ACV it's not as strong but does exactly the same thing, for less money and less harm to your healthy skin.

After a few applications the wart will turn whiter and then turn black and fall off. Pretty simple stuff.  I would take a few days off to let the skin heal and then keep applying it to get down into the skin.

Now for the easy part. Take Lysine every day. 

It's basically an immune booster that makes your hormones and antibodies kick the virus in the teeth. It allows your body to get the jump on the virus and control it to stop future outbreaks. People use it for all kinds of outbreaks from herpes to hpv.

Try to get Lysine that is soy free to avoid reactions. I have read of some intestinal discomfort when you first start taking it, but nothing serious.

So yeah, there you go. HPV and the warts it causes can't be cured and can be very embarrassing. Hopefully this helps somebody without insurance that wants to get a jump on treating their problem, reducing the warts, and stopping future outbreaks.

* EDIT: I'm not saying - ""don't go to the doctor."" Please get tested to find out what you might have. If you have HPV, chances are you might have the clap too! All I'm saying is you can treat warts and HPV just as effectively as a doctor for very little money if you don't have insurance, the time, or whatever might keep you from going.",23,6,2011-07-21,PHARMA,0.06100412458181381,0.9072432518005371,0.031752582639455795

Health,"Reddit, help me! I am suddenly very sensitive to sounds and textures. Can anyone help me figure out why?","I should mention I'm 28 year old female.

It started... a couple of days ago, I guess. I keep thinking that it will go away but it just seems to get worse as the day progresses.

Any kind of high-pitched, scraping, or just plain loud noise makes me super uncomfortable while I'm hearing it and for a moment afterward.

Touching any sort of rough texture gives me the same uncomfortable feeling but not as strongly. This includes touching my t-shirt or jeans, flipping pages in a book (I made the mistake of trying to read last night. It was not fun.). 

To be honest, it's making it very difficult for me to want to do anything, for fear of triggering this uncomfortable response my body is having to the stimuli.

**Does ANYONE have ANY idea why the heck this could be happening to me?!** 

* Could it be some sort of damage to my ear drum? (I suspect the touching things bothers me because I can hear it and it's the same sort of noise.)

* Could it be some sort of problem with my teeth? They have been feeling especially uncomfortable the past couple of days too.

* Could it be some sort of nutrient deficiency? I haven't had much of an appetite in the past couple weeks.

* Could it be some kind of reaction from my medication? I've searched for side effects but couldn't find anything that fits. (I take Xyrem, Metformin, and Levothyroxin.)",12,5,2011-07-22,PHARMA,0.1031709685921669,0.8652716875076294,0.03155732527375221
Health,Please help solve my boyfriend's penis pain after sex!! Any information would be appreciated. Urologist wouldn't answer question for AMA.,"My boyfriend and I are both 21 and have some unusual sexual problems. Often times after we are finished having sex, he has a very intense pain in his penis and feels the need to go to the bathroom to urinate. He sits on the toilet until he can urinate. He says urination hurts, but in the end makes it feel better. The pain can last anywhere from 10-30 minutes, but he always feels better in the morning. I have looked up Prostatitis, but for him- the pain only happens after ejaculation. I am not sure if this is important or not, but I want to clarify that he does not have painful orgasms and the pain usually sets in about 5-10 minutes after he has ejaculated. Also, I am not sure if this is normal in guys, but he will usually have additional semen that comes out of his penis even after cleanup...maybe even 10-15 minutes after we have finished having sex. It is never much, but could this maybe be related to the pain?

He went to the doctor about 6 months ago and had a course of antibiotics. The problem seemed to improve a bit (though rarely the pain still occurred). Should he go back on antibiotics to see if this improves again? The doctor suggested a reduction in caffeine, but that doesn't really do much. This has really taken a toll on our sex life because he subconsciously identifies pleasure with pain. His libido has continued to decrease to the point where he only masturbates once a week, if that.

For a few weeks at a time I get extremely depersonalized to the point where if I look at my hands or at myself in the mirror I feel like I'm looking at myself from another place. Kind of like a third-person perspective.


During these times I don't feel pain normally. I feel it, but it doesn't *hurt*. I don't know how to explain it. I can pinch myself and I know it hurts, but it's like I'm just perceiving the pain and it's not really affecting *me*.

Can anyone relate in any way? I'm thinking it must be related to my brain somehow but I don't know what could cause this. It's not too debilitating other than causing mild stress sometimes when I feel too disconnected from my body (derealized, like if nothing is real). Everything else functions normally.

medicine,"Gap Year Decisions/Options, please offer your advice and perspective /r/Medicine!","**About me:** live in New York City. I just graduated from a highly regarded university with a BA. I am currently applying to medical school, and still need to figure out what I am doing during my gap year while I wait to get in somewhere 

**Stats:**33 MCAT, 3.5 GPA and SGPA 

**ECS:** Conference Presenter in Philosophy, 3 years Lab Research in same lab-if project continues (without me) I will be an author, participated in 1 year long and 1 summer long clinical research projects, had a few leadership positions, 1 year long volunteer position for underprivileged kids where I tutored and coached).

There are similar posts up about what to do during the gap year, but there are a few things they do not focus on: Money versus Having a Worthwhile experience. Here are my options (and note I know, July is very late to be getting into all this)

**The Options**

* **1.** I was essentially offered a spot in Columbia's Bioethics Masters Program for this upcoming year (1 year program), while doing volunteer research with a Cornell Medical Ethics Prof.

Pros: Continues major work I did as an undergrad, the degree will further my career options after medical school, will be a fascinating experience for me, I can network with important people

Cons: Adds potentially $55,000 of debt to my future $200,000-$250,000 of Med School debt that I will incur.

* **2.** Volunteer Bench Research in Molecular Biology at Hospital for Special Surgery or Cornell (I have a few volunteer offers already)

Pros: Could be meaningful experience, may lead to an authorship, although it is only one year and it is difficult to do meaningful work in that period of time

Cons: Will not get paid! Funding is so low now, it is impossible to get paid. Also, because I'm planning my gap year so late, it is too late for anyone who could pay me to set money aside

* **3.**Take EMT-B course to find a job in an ambulance/hospital as an EMT or ER Technician

Pros: Would be great as experience, and expose me to things that will help me in med school, and give me stories for the med school interview

Cons: Courses cost around $1,000 and last 3 months, so assuming I can find a job after the course (preferably as an ER Tech) I will only get to work until medical school starts, so figure only December-July (8 months)

Health,Sleeping problems,"I hope this is the right subreddit.

For the past month, my sleep was way off course. I was literally sleeping all day and staying up all night. I finally managed to fix it, but I'm not sure what's wrong now. I am sleepy all the time. The past three days I haven't been able to stay up longer than 12 hours. For example, yesterday I woke up at 6:30 AM, fell asleep at 6:30 PM and woke up at 4:30 AM today.

I'm not overweight(6""1 145), so I'm not sure if I'm developing diabetes. Still, it's pretty worrying. I should also note that recently, even after doing something as simple as running up the stairs, I'm sort of out of breath.

Health,"Reddit, I have back pain that seems to be linked to my diet. Any ideas?","For at least six years, I have been getting lower back pain roughly in the area of my kidneys. Sometimes it's a dull ache, sometimes it's debilitating, but it's always located around my kidneys, although sometimes it's hard to locate and can cause pressure in my bowel or on my testicles.

I started keeping track of it, and based on what I've noted down it appears to be linked to drinking some form of drink when I have an empty stomach. I've had it happen to me to varying degrees with cola, with various different types of concentrate or non-concentrate fruit juice and smoothies, with cider and beer. Given that it doesn't happen with milk or water (or, at least, hasn't yet - I don't drink much of either) I've guessed that it's the sugar or acid content of these drinks that's doing it, but that's really a guess. The thing is, I can drink any of the drinks that give me this problem if I've eaten recently - not necessarily just after the first meal of the day, but I can drink as much of these drinks as I like as long as I've eaten beforehand. There's a definite link between the contents of my stomach and whether or not I feel the pain. Overwhelmingly I get this pain either when drinking something with the first meal of the day or before it.

I have a history of Type-II diabetes in my family (my father and my maternal grandmother) and my father died of kidney failure, so given that there seemed to be a sugar and kidney link I went to the doctor on these grounds. I had a (non-fasting) blood test which showed nothing out of the ordinary except high cholesterol (that despite it not being a fasting test, I'm still working to reduce), and an ultrasound on my kidneys that also showed no apparent issues.

I'm aware that one possible solution is simply to ensure that I don't drink anything that might trigger it before I've had a meal, or to just ensure that I eat a decent breakfast every day, but I feel like while that'll solve the immediate issue I'm also very curious as to why this might happen and if it might indicate a wider health issue. Does anyone have any experience with this or could steer me to something that might help me figure out what's going on?

What I found most fascinating about his whole blog was that it gave some insight into what happens in the entire medical school experience.

I'm starting medical school in just a couple weeks and the plan is to get a blog going along the same vein as egoviri's. The goal is to give med applicants and pre-med students some impression of the medschool life. Hopefully I'll be able to do about one or two submissions each week.

I would appreciate some feedback about what anyone would love to see or what you think would be helpful information to include. 

The blog is [Dysgraphia Required](http://dysreq.blogspot.com). Only one submission so far, but that'll change.
