-Depression:  I had a rather difficult bout early in the year.  I'm currently on my last week of Effexor (Venlafaxine HCL) and feeling very good.  I have a Hx of depression, but nothing like this.

-Increased hair loss:  Heavy thinning in the back, the ""Friar Tuck""

-Increased sweating:  I'm sweating over almost anything these days.  Night sweats are terrible, my wife can't get near me without getting soaked.

-Snoring:  I've gone from a non-snorer to so bad that I have to sleep in a different room to not keep my wife awake.

-Decreased Libido

-Decreased Motivation

-Decrease in feeling of ""Manlyness:  Can't think of a better way to put it.

medicine,Describe your country's med school.,"What's up meddit!
I have always wondered about how med schools in other countries work.
For instance, I am studying in South Africa. It is a 5-year program that you enter straight after school (There is no ""pre-med""). Entry depends on your end of school marks, be it with the public or private education system as well as the results of your NBT tests, which is a benchmark test not specifically related to gaining medschool entry.
Other factors that acceptance are extra-academic activities such as leadership, sporting and cultural achievements (but this is to a lesser extent), and race. Race is rather important at some Universities - if you are wondering why, ask me or else read up about apartheid in RSA and methods of correcting it.

I am now in my 2nd year, and some of the things I will be doing soon(start of 2014) include going out to clinics and assessing children using IMCI principles.
Half-way through your third year you start doing rounds in the hospitals in addition to the hell of a lot class you have.

The degree is basically 2 and a half years of pure theory, and then you start ""working"" in the hospitals. 

After your undergrad degree you do an internship at a public hospital for two years, and following that you do one year of community service at a typically rural clinic.

After that you continue working as a GP or choose to study further, should you be accepted.

Also, how much attention gets given to the subject of AIDS and infectious diseases ? In South Africa this gets a lot of attention. Basically every disease we learn, we also learn how AIDS affects it. 
But would I be right in assuming that most 1st world countries give much less attention to it?

medicine,What do you think about stethoscope disinfection? Should it be as common as hand-washing?,"In the hospital and clinic I've noticed some physicians clean their stethoscope with an alcohol wipe (though not very consistently). I did a little research and found [this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20692728) which concluded: 

""Common sense would dictate that stethoscopes should be cleaned after each patient contact, as one would clean one’s hands. We have demonstrated that routine cleaning of stethoscopes with a steret significantly reduces bacterial contamination and eliminates pathogens. Most clinicians (94%) intuitively felt that they should clean their stethoscopes, but the majority were not aware of the current guidelines. Guidance aiming to prompt stethoscope cleaning after every patient contact is hidden in the depths of hospital policy where frontline workers, the key players in the fight against HAI, are blissfully unaware of them. It is therefore paramount to remind clinicians of the evidence that stethoscopes, an indispensable diagnostic tool, may also act as a vector for disease transmission. Stethoscopes should therefore be cleaned, along with hands, after each patient contact.""

Is this an important issue? In my education, this has not been emphasized at all. It seems the biggest hurdle would be convenience. It takes a decent amount of time to find an alcohol swab, open it and clean a stethoscope after each patient contact. 

What do you think about a little box that would attach to a stethoscope that contained alcohol swabs that could be easily pulled out? Would that increase compliance?",21,24,2013-11-03,PHARMA,0.06438405066728592,0.8976466059684753,0.03796936571598053

Health,"Guy asked what's up with people calling Risperdal takers ""zombies""... Here's my take.","Zombie is the fucking word. A close friend of mine was put on this shit, and to be perfectly honest you probably won't see many people elaborate on it's effects because it's really painful to see someone you care about unable to follow as much a cartoon.

Imagine your closest friend or a brother is going through some rough psychological stuff. They get prescribed this pill by a doctor who never even tries to really get to the bottom of the emotional trauma, but says ""I believe in this pill - I believe in science."" Your bro stops talking about lizard people or whatever after a few days, but also stops talking at all. There is no emotional resonance in your friend. You laugh at a great movie bit, look at them to see if they're sharing your experience, and they don't even realize you're looking at them. They're just zoned out. Always.

Well, maybe it'll get better you say. The doctor usually tells you that they'll need 6 months to a few years to really see if they're working. What they don't tell you is - No one gets better. They just have a lower ""relapse rate"". People not on pills sometimes get better, but the people I know who took it basically had their emotions amputated.

If you are lucky, your friend will notice SOME of the side effects of the drug - getting out of bed before noon has become a great rarity, weird and increasingly severe facial tics and nerve twitches, aches and dryness etc. They can't enjoy food or music. Maybe their mood is more stable, but no one on that shit ever ""feels GOOD"". Within ten minutes of popping the thing they're asleep. How good can it be.

So they go back to their doctor, who says, well we can switch your medication, but I really think you should try it out for longer and give it a ""fair trial"". He scares you with the side effects of alternative drugs, talks about ""relapse rates"", and basically treats the patient like a percentage. To him, as long as you don't have another full blown episode, you're fine and dandy.

But your bro is, to all emotional purposes, gone. Your bro is gone dude, and fucking walking the earth like a zombie. Although, try and get them to go for a walk with you, and you'll hit a brick wall. Exercise is now as much fun for your bro as eating or sex, or anything, which is to say, no fun.

And even when/if they get off the shit you don't know if they'll ever be the same, or close to it. And since the doctor probably didn't know the same warm, friendly guy you knew before the pills, they never even see the damage they're causing.

They don't see how their patients don't sing or play guitar any more. Or how their ability to see bullshit as bullshit is gone. Or how they can't enjoy pretty much anything. They just see the same [dead eyed stare](http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5040c3526bb3f7c27a000051-480/risperdal.jpg) that's on the risperdal marketing shit.

So you try to convince them to quit. Like you know better than their doctor... Imagine feeling the contempt from your friend's doctor as you tell him how your friend has changed on the pills. They think you're an uneducated-anti-big-pharma-hippy the second you open your mouth. It's really easy for them to keep pumping this shit into a vulnerable population and not feel bad at all.

Some people I know on that drug or its sisters are still on it and probably will be forever. One has stopped, and is on another one that dulls her a bit less. She is cutting that out too, against the advice of her doctor. Most people who get off anti-psychs in the real world, I suspect, have to do it on their own, without their doctor's support. Any way, she's doing better already. There's some light in her eyes again, and some fire. 

Some day soon, I think we'll look back at these drugs the same way we look at lobotomies now. It's a crude way to knock the life out of someone so they 'don't hurt themselves'. You'll see people out there who defend the drugs, say it saved their life - but look at how they write. Emotionless shit. I, I, I. I feel so bad for them, and us. 

 It's laughable to hear doctors explain ""how they work"". I heard a lot about ""restoring chemical balance in the brain"", and ""dopamine levels"". Good thing brains are so fucking simple a patented molecule can cure anxiety and psychosis. Just gotta find the right one! There's risperdal, zyprexa, clorazapine, and on and on.

The unfunny thing really is, the people I know on it were on it for it's original intended, approved purpose. This shit is barbaric and unconscionable, from so many angles.

medicine,A Vital Measure: Your Surgeon’s Skill (x-post from /r/medicalschool),"Trying to avoid nytimes paywall, I will post excerpts. 

tl;dr: Some surgeons are way more dextrous and skilled than others, and this affects patient outcomes. This skill can be quantified and used to help less skilled surgeons improve.

http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/a-vital-measure-your-surgeons-skill/?_r=3

&gt; But everything changed when a new surgeon came on board. Built like a rugby player, he shocked us first with his speed, and then his results. The once unbearable day-long slog became a morning’s work; and instead of spending weeks in the hospital, his patients went home after eight days.

&gt; In the operating room, his bear paw hands turned delicate, teasing out tissues, caressing vessels and nimbly knotting thread as fine as human hair. There was not a single wasted movement; and each step blended seamlessly with the next, giving those of us who had the fortune to observe the sense that we were watching not surgery, but a well-choreographed ballet.

&gt; “It’s like you’re just standing there holding the needle or knife,” said one friend who was lucky enough to assist the new surgeon, “and he’s moving the body underneath you.”

&gt; Now an innovative collaboration between researchers, payers and weight-loss surgeons, the Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative, has addressed that-which-could-not-be-named. And their findings have confirmed what patients have long suspected and trainees have long known – the dexterity of a surgeon’s hands can account for much of the differences in how well patients do.

&gt; To the researchers’ surprise, there were huge variations in operative skill between the practicing surgeons, with the lowest ranked surgeons working at what the reviewers considered a level only slightly better than a trainee at the end of residency, and the highest-ranking surgeons working like “masters” in their field.

&gt; The study is the first to reliably measure operative skills in practicing surgeons and correlate those measurements with patient outcomes. “We now have a scientific way to evaluate a practicing surgeon’s skill that is as reliable as about anything we measure in health care in terms of quality,” Dr. Birkmeyer observed.

&gt; Even practicing surgeons, who have few opportunities after residency training to strengthen their operative techniques, may benefit from the research. Dr. Birkmeyer and his colleagues are currently studying how coaching from “master surgeons” might help other surgeons improve their rankings. “There may be some strategies for not just measuring a problem but ultimately fixing it.”

medicine,Why doctors die differently. (Short Essay),"Hey meddit, I wrote this essay on my viewpoints regarding how doctors die different from their patients. Feed back appreciated! 

No matter how much you don’t want to think about it, someday we will all eventually die. Some of us may die in an accident, or of a terminal disease, or at home peacefully in the night. Not a single one of us can control if we die or not, that is a fact of life. However, in some cases we can decide how we die. Through research and personal experiences working in a hospital, there is one critical factor that usually decides how people die, that factor being if you are doctor or not. Your first assumption might be that doctors have the money to buy the most complex and innovative procedures to elongate their lives, but it is just the opposite. The general trend shows that doctors choose less invasive procedures and get more do no resuscitate (DNR) orders than the general public. The disparity between how doctors and their patients die is enormous. A survey reports that 65 percent of doctors have an end of life directive compared to only 20 percent of the general population. Also, when the public was asked if they would want cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if they were in a coma, 90 percent of the public said yes, compared to less than 20 percent of doctors answering yes. The truth of the matter is that doctors know a lot more facts than patients do when it comes to their end of life care, therefore they opt for less care near the end of their lives.

When doctors think about their end of life care they often do not choose invasive procedures, but why is this? They choose these options because doctors have seen first hand the effect of invasive procedures. Take CPR example, almost all doctors have seen or preformed CPR, something the general public usually has never seen in real life. The process in gruesome as health care professionals preform chest compressions, cracking ribs and sometimes damaging organs in order to keep your blood flowing. If more people knew about the process of CPR, perhaps we would have more people filing DNR orders, ordering doctors not to preform it. General trends also show that doctors frequently do not choose invasive procedures near the end of their lives as well. These invasive procedures are usually referred to as “futile care” in the medical field.  Futile care has a broad definition, however it most commonly refers to care given to very sick patients in attempt to lengthen their lives, even when the procedures are highly likely to fail. When a procedure has a 15 percent chance of saving a life, the general public would usually choose this procedure, while doctors would opt out. Doctors are more familiar with these odds and know to choose to die peacefully instead. Near the end of their lives, doctors have come to realize that they should be spending it with family, passing peacefully, not in a hospital connected to tons of tubing all in hope for a medical miracle that most patients hope for. 

If doctors make the choices they do near the end of their lives, wouldn’t it make sense that their patients would too? The disparity between the ways doctors die compared to their patients is very alarming. If patients are getting all of the facts from their doctors, why are the doctors treating themselves differently from their patients? The fact of the matter is that patients are sometimes ignorant when it comes to end of life care, explaining the disparity. Due to factors such as the media and the wish of patients to do “everything possible”, they end up causing more pain to those near the end of their lives. For these reasons, I believe we see the disparity in end of life care between doctors and the general public. 

There are many different medical dramas on TV today, all featuring doctors working to save people’s lives, pulling off major medical feats to save the day. However accurate people may believe these shows are, they seldom show the reality of life and death in hospitals today. TV doctors almost always come up with a last minute treatment that can save their patient, but the reality is that this is seldom the case. The real doctors do everything they can to keep patients alive, but sometimes there is just nothing that a doctor can do. One of the most common misconceptions that people make based on their TV knowledge is the effectiveness of CPR. In medical TV shows the doctors will almost always save someone’s life with a couple chest compressions and a shock of the heart. The sad part is, that this is almost never the case. The New England Journal of medicine did a study on these medical TV shows, and found that in television shows, CPR was effective in 75 percent of the 60 cases observed, and of those successful cases 65 percent of them got to go home. Meanwhile, in a 2010 study on CPR, out of 95,000 cases where CPR was preformed, it was found that only 8 percent of patients survived for more than a month. Of the patients who survived, 37.5 percent could live a normal life, another 37.5 percent were in a vegetative state, and 25 percent were alive but deemed to had a “poor outcome”. The major gap in success rates on TV can be influencing people to believe that CPR is much more successful than it actually is in real life. This can help account for why so many people choose not to get a DNR order, because they assume based on TV, CPR is not as affective as it is in real life. 
The way the media portray doctors and medicine on TV can help explain why people try invasive measures in real life as well. Some people believe that doctors can save everyone, and that invasive procedures can save lives. I argue that for terminally ill or very elderly patients, we come up with a directive of care, outlining wishes to not preform these invasive procedures. The issue arises with the actual success rates and pain that these invasive procedures can cause our loved ones. Most of the time the procedures cause more pain then help, and can have little effect on patient’s lives. People should weight the costs and listen to their doctors for medical advice when it comes to these procedures. Sure they might work on TV, but a doctor will be able to tell you if they think it is worth trying the procedure. A family might not be ready to let go of a beloved family member, but you could actually be causing more pain to a loved one in their final moments, when you could instead be spending time with a family member. This way people will be able to die peacefully and not painfully after very invasive procedures.

When family members are terminally ill, or near the end of their life, family members and individuals usually want everything that can be done to prolong the patient’s life. It is our basic human nature to do so, and people look to doctors to save the day and find a cure. Doctors will always prescribe what they think the best action is to help the patient, but sometimes it gets to a point where there is nothing more to do. Family members will ask for all the options, and a doctor might report some sort of “futile care” procedure to help prolong the patient’s life. This procedure is usually an option that doctors would not wish on themselves, but patients and family want. This raises the question why do people not opt out of these futile procedures? The simple fact of the matter is that people don’t realize the true scope of medicine, while doctors do. There is only so much that a doctor can do for a patient. Doctors realize they might be able to add on 2 more months to their life through some drug or surgery, but at what cost?  The general public needs to realize that these costs might not be worth it if they are dying, when good times with family might be more valuable to them.

Doctors deal with death and terminally ill patients on a frequent basis. They have seen many different people die, and have a greater sense of knowledge on how the final stages of life work. They see pain, and futile last-ditch efforts to save patients and realize that there is only so much that can be done. The fact that health care providers understand this at such a deeper level then the general public creates disparities between how doctors die versus their patients. This is caused by the media’s influence as well as the fact that doctors have more knowledge of end of life care. I argue that people need to start thinking more about their end of life care to ensure that we all can die a peaceful death; so that we too can die like the people who are doing everything they can to keep us alive.",13,59,2013-11-09,PHARMA,0.05155707709491253,0.9189964532852173,0.029446447268128395

My total cholesterol is almost 300. I feel horrible (mentally and emotionally) right now. I cried and I got pissed off. But this is my fault. I made bad decisions. I guess I thought my body could handle the crap I gave it. It can't. So now I have changed my diet and I'm following the Mediterranean Diet now. I know it will be hard for a few days but hopefully I will get used to it. I'm going to start exercising more too. I don't want to have a heart attack or have heart surgery before I'm 40. This blood test was a real eye-opener. I'm glad I have a chance to change things around and not let my body down. My advise to everyone? Don't think your body can handle everything you throw into it.

The kid I saw with measles was status post seizure and extremely febrile. So basically, we're all fucked. Herd immunity be damned. 

The kids parents were begging us to save their child. Then when asked about vaccines, they said ""no, no we wanted our child to be natural"" or something along those lines. Then when they found out that this could have most likely been avoided with vaccination they felt pretty bad. Sorry that I'm not sorry you tried to kill your kid and others around your kid.

I'm thinking part of the reason people don't vaccinate, is that they don't understand how deadly these diseases can be. They've never seen polio or mumps. It just frustrates me to no end.

And when I forget to check for radio-femoral delay, I am tormented until I see the patient again. Once I called a patient back on a pretext because I thought if I didn't, he would turn out to have coarctation. And if I did check for it, then he would be spared. 

There are so many other silent killers hiding in my patient's body, so many thousands - no, millions - of other bedside manoeuvres that I could home in on. Why do I worry so about coarctation?

I was the only one on for my floor and had someone with a DVT and a suspected PE that I was dealing with so I didn't get over to see this young man for about 45 minutes.  When I showed up I apologized for the wait and asked if I could evaluate his hand.  The patient tells me his hand no longer hurts but he has a few other questions - diabetes, his methadone use and struggles with weight loss.  I got it; He wasn't a bad guy.  He couldn't sleep and had his concerns so I spent about 20 minutes answering his questions.  From what I recall it was a really pleasant conversation.

Last night I got an official email stating that the patient had lodged a complaint about me stating that I took too long to answer his calls and I left him in pain.

I now have a meeting with my program director to discuss this.

pharmacy,Customers/Patients Having Medical Emergencies in the Store,"Ran into this situation recently and thought I'd ask for some advice. In pharmacy school I got CPR for healthcare provider training, and they taught us to use Epipens when we learned to give flu shots. I've renewed this training as necessary, but that is literally all the first responder-ish training I've had. I really don't think I know enough basic first aid to be the go-to person if something was to happen in the store. 

Since I've been practicing under my own license, I've only had a handful of situations come up where a customer needed some sort of minor medical attention. One lady was bitten by a bug and thought she was having an allergic reaction (she wasn't, or at least not one that required a doctor visit), a few had been concerned about their blood pressure (that one I can actually handle), etc. But the one that really put me in an awkward place happened most recently. 

The short version is a front end customer thought she was having a hypoglycemic episode. A front end staff member called back to the pharmacy and wanted me to come check on the lady in the middle of a rush in the pharmacy. The lady had already been given a place to sit and some soda to raise her glucose levels, but the manager on duty was insistent that I go check her out. 

My problem with this is what could I have really done for her? They'd already done literally everything I would know to do. I guess I could've taken a meter up and checked her sugar, but then should I have charged her for the product/service?

Like I said, Google isn't helping at all and I am home alone with my boyfriend working overnight and no vehicle.. Its been happening for 2 days and I've never had this happen to me before. I asked my mom if it was normal because she had 3 kids and she said she's never had it happen before, and she has never heard of it happening to anyone else. I'm pretty embarrassed about it.. It comes out even when I'm not using the toilet. Boyfriend doesn't have this happening to him and we eat the same things together every day.

pharmacy,Is there an association between PPI use and community acquired pneumonia?,"I want to hear your thoughts since this is kind of a gray area. The studies that I read had a sharp increase in the risk of CAP when starting newly prescribed PPI, but often times, PPI's are prescribed for early pneumonia symptoms, thus resulting in a correlation and not a causation. Interestingly, long term use of PPI's do not have an increased risk of CAP.

Health,My wife had to go to the Emergency room last night and had to have surgery. I dont have insurance and I don't know where to begin. Please help,"My wife is 24 and i am 27. She started to feel sick late yesterday afternoon and started puking constantly till around midnight when she started throwing up blood. So we took her to the emergency room and now they have to do emergency surgery and she just found out she will have to stay a few days. Im scared and don't know what to do as we have a 2 year old and i am the only one that works and i work monday through friday and i don't have any vacation or sick time and cannot afford to miss work let alone we don't have insurance. Please if someone could please point me in the right direction. I don't know if i can get insurance for her now that she's already admitted. Her family has no way of helping and my parents are not in town either to at least watch my daughter. I would appreciate if someone could enlighten me as to how to handle this situation in terms of services that may be available for this type of situation. 


EDIT: I appreciate all of the support and my wife ended up not having to have the surgery. The nurse nor doctor would disclose this piece of information after two MRI's, X-rays, and another test. Only after working the answer out of the nurse from his experience when the doctors say that you can have a liquid diet he stated that almost 99% of the time means that they were not going to have to do surgery. They of course did want my wife to stay another 48 hours for antibiotics and to stay monitored which we just simply cannot afford another $9000 dollars for her to stay for that. They were able to write her a prescription for the antibiotics and I will be monitoring her through the night. We have managed to work out a fairly decent payment plan with the hospital and are still looking into some of the things you guys have suggested. Hindsight 20/20 it would have been a much better idea and a lot less stressful to get health insurance. We are currently checking out our options and hope we find something reasonably priced. We still are not sure how to pick a plan but hopefully we can solve this riddle before anything else happens. Again thank you guys so much!! I look forward to redditing with you all and hope soon I will be able to repay by helping someone with a question they may have about something.",77,161,2013-11-24,PHARMA,0.02104402519762516,0.9142860174179077,0.06466991454362869

pharmacy,"""The last four digits..."" - retail rant","I'm tired of dealing with the pin pad and having customers deal with the pin pad. The large demographic in my area is the elderly who can't see the pin pad or complain about writing on it, and frankly I don't blame them.

For a electronic transaction, a customer is prompted to donate to a charity, enter their PIN, cash back, and ""amount okay?"". Preceding this, I am supposed to ask them about their rewards card, of which many do not carry but enter in a phone number to search for their account, because that's easier, right? So they type it in (correctly, this can be an issue), we see they have multiple accounts so we narrow it down, all for the sake of letting corporate have eyes on the transaction. 

To top things off, any time we scan an rx to have it added to the transaction, we must again direct the customer's attention to the freaking pin pad so they can enter in the last four digits of their phone number. Multiple family members with the same phone number? Who cares! Enter in the last four digits again for the second person with rx's being added to the transaction. Great new feature! What gets me is in drive-thru where this option isn't available to the customer, we are prompted to confirm that we verified the patient's information. I get that all of this is to help prevent errors, but how much is too much?

She has been in the hospital ICU since day one, hooked up to a ventilator as she's unable to breathe on her own at this time and is completely paralyzed from the neck down.  The hospital is now at a point where they want to send her to a Long Term Acute Care hospital for continued treatment and recovery.  Problem is, the only local LTAC, Vibra (formerly Kindred), does not currently have a neurologist affiliation and would not be able to provide continued treatment.  And the only other LTACs in the vicinity are 1-2 hours away.   Our hospital case worker stated that she is exploring all of our options, including working with Vibra to get a Neurologist on-board.  But, my question is, do I have any other options if they come back saying that she will need to go to one of these other facilities?

Anyway, I'm a mid-20s female who is for the most part healthy. (I recently had routine bloodwork done and everything came back normal.) I've always had fairly thick hair, fine to medium texture. I have had it chemically processed (permanent professional hair colour) over the recent years (I am a professional in the industry and take excellent care of my hair) on an average of every 8 to 10 weeks for the last four years or so.

Recently I've noticed that I've been sprouting new hairs. Not just typical growth hairs, but ones that are coming down off my hairline - never where my hairline has been before. It's mostly concentrated in the middle - It's like I'm developing a widow's peak. 

It should be noted that I have psoriasis on my scalp, and was using (6+ months ago) Valisone (topical corticosteroid) and noticed no hair loss.

What I would LIKE to see in this sub is more stuff that pharmacists or techs can use, like new information or new trends in pharmacy.  Do you think it's finally time we compile all the information from all these like threads and get them all into ONE spot?

medicine,Looking for stethescope that will link to bluetooth hearing aid,Does anyone know of a stethescope that links in a bluetooth manner to hearing aids without gangly wires? The electronic stethescopes available are not strong enough for my hearing loss. It seems to me that if you can link a phone directly to my individually programmed hearing aids it should be possible to link a stethescope. All the posts I find online are 2-3 years old and the only one that seems even remotely possible seems very 'unhandy'. My new hearing aids are difficult to turn off - the battery door is tight and I'm afraid taking it out multiple times a day it will soon break - but the aids are wonderful for voice and I think would be so for a bluetooth application.,6,41,2013-11-30,PHARMA,0.033893998712301254,0.9220420122146606,0.04406403377652168
Health,Sweating is taking over my life...,"I have litterly tried everything..  Certain dri,  drysol,  mitchum....

I get to work and I have huge armpit sweat stains,  not little ones either I can deal with that,  mine soak the sleeves of my Polo and create a stain about the size of a dinner plate within less than an hour!!  I seriously don't know of what to do anymore,  and to make it worse my uniform is red,  so the stains stick out from a mile a way.   

I've been to the doctor twice with. Our help he said basically there is . no cure if the prescribed drysol doesn't work.  I've also had my thyroid and other things checked with a blood test and everything came back good. 

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.

Health,"Best before, Use by, etc. What happens with toothpaste????","So I found a container (not a tube) of toothpaste in the cabinet that had an ""expiry"" date of January 2011. Not being one to waste anything, I started using it. I have been using it for about a month. I asked a pharmacist about this. He said don't use it! I asked what happens to it. He replied he really doesn't know but that there may well be a chemical change in the glob of white that may not be healthy.
So my question: what actually DOES happen that requires a ""use before"" or ""best before"" date? Did I put my fragile life on the line? Or is the pharmacist (and others) just trying to get me to waste product and buy their new product?",6,12,2013-11-30,PHARMA,0.03436418995261192,0.930016279220581,0.03561960160732269
