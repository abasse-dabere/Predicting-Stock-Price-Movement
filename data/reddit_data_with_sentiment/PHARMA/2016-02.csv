medicine,Zika Virus - what am I missing here?,"I decided to actually look into Zika virus today, after hearing outrageous things in the news (like recommendations from Central/South American countries for women to avoid becoming pregnant for the next 2 years), and seeing the CDCs recommended protocol for pregnant women who have been in an endemic area (serial US +/- amniocentesis in all of them).

I was kind of surprised to find out that all of this panic is being caused by essentially no evidence. The big concern is microcephaly if pregnant women are infected. Yet the big publication that caused this to take off was terrible.

http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6503e2.htm

A positive Zika infection history was defined as a retrospective maternal history of having a rash during pregnancy.

The increase in incidence from 1-2/10,000 to 20/10,000 corresponded with a change in how microcephally was reported to health authorities. It also is essentially the same as the incidence of microcephally in most other countries (including ones not endemic with Zika).

medicine,"If I wanted to develop an EHR, how should I go about it?","I'll get right to it. Medical software is grossly and desperately behind the times.

I'm a software engineer and not a medical professional. Let's get that out of the way.

One of the largest outcries I've seen is that EHR systems are cumbersome to use and pull GPs away from their patients. Another one is interoperability; one EHR talking to another is nearly impossible (I know from experience; LabCorp is _so much fun_ to work with..). There are endless lists of the things that medical professionals hate about their EHR; that's not what I'm looking for.

Having worked in a billing and coding shop for about four months, I was _mortified_ at the potential for meaningful technology in the medical field and the lack thereof. One of the ladies had to print all of her reports, collate them, and then scan them back in to another system to submit claims. That was just one of the atrocities I witnessed.

As I said, I'm not a medical professional, but instead a software engineer with focuses on cryptography and user experience. I guarantee you the majority of software teams working on any other EHR are the same or similar. I can't imagine they interfaced with a large sample of medical professionals, and they probably view medical software exclusively as points of data entry.

One thing I realized is that these applications are the opposite of patient-centric, and I began to wonder how anything got done or how proper care could even be administered whilst swimming through a wall of input fields.

In the _hypothetical_ event I wanted to design an EHR that wasn't absolute shit (working in a billing/coding office made me sick to my stomach seeing all of the useless tripe that is considered 'software'), what would medical professionals like to see in regards to cooperation between the developers of such a system and themselves?

I'm familiar with the more technical medical constructs such as ICD-9/10 codes and whatnot. That isn't what I'm worried about. I don't know what class I antiarrhythmic drugs are or what electrophysiology entails, and it's silly and naive that companies approach software pretending they can cover the absolutely vast amount of medical concepts a complete system needs to handle by treating all of it as mere data entry - poorly, I might add.

So let's hear it. I'm curious as to how medical professionals would envision a relationship with software developer(s) designing their EHR. How would you see a development company _adequately_ approaching medical software in order for it to be useful and enhancing to their work, regardless of the type of care being practiced?

Think outside the box. Looking for anything, even if it's ambitious.",52,27,2016-02-02,PHARMA,0.11763579398393631,0.859603226184845,0.0227610245347023

medicine,What is the legality of physicians doing long-term management of patients who are supplementing with illegal substances?,"For example, bodybuilding has always been an interest of mine. I'm under no delusion and fully acknowledge that all the pro bodybuilders as well as Hollywood actors and a significant chunk of professional athletes undergo exogenous hormonal supplementation. Where is the line in being an endocrinologist and managing these types of patients? I know there definitely are physicians out there currently doing this kind of thing and would like to get some ideas as to this ""subspecialty"" of endocrinology outside of geriatrics and gynecology.

Main things I'm curious about:

1. HIPAA, so most likely no mandatory reporting to feds?
1. Probably can't directly (and legally) supply the hormonal supplements when no medical need? IE for sports, acting, etc NOT recovery from injury
1. Probably CAN directly manage patients AFTER they themselves administer anabolics?
1. Probably legal to directly test black-market anabolics to test for purity, much like how there's free testing kits for recreational drugs in many concerts?

I mean ultimately, I'm willing to bet a significant chunk that there's a huge fuzzy grey line here that enables physicians to prescribe anabolics for ""injuries"" that go beyond what's the usual amount perfectly legally. I'm wondering where is the line in providing safe medical advice and management, since driving all this underground will just increase the health risks of the individual.",8,17,2016-02-02,PHARMA,0.040889810770750046,0.929602861404419,0.029507355764508247

medicine,Why and How I quit practicing Medicine.,"Ever since I can remember, I wanted to be a Doctor. I think I knew that by the time I was 12. 

The human body was an amazing wonder to me. I excelled in Biology throughout school, effortlessly; certificates and awards in Biology and Chemistry became an annual occurrence.

I knew that it was medical school for me the minute I graduated high school; I couldn't imagine studying anything else.  No one asked me or enforced it upon me. It was my choice.

It was hard work. Really hard. For 6 years I read large, heavy books about Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I went on clinical rounds to learn how to examine patients and how to treat them. I had to be accept dealing with sleepless nights, dead bodies, weird odors, and angry patients.

In 2008, I  graduated the 3rd of my class with Distinctions.

I returned back to my home and began my Internship year. It was one of the toughest years of my life. After that I was forced to stay at home for about a year while I was looking for a job.

My big break finally came, and I joined a large teaching hospital as a resident in Internal Medicine. I was excited, eager, and loved my work.


Today, I no longer want to be in Medicine. 

It's not that I don't to be in Medicine per say, I still want a career in Healthcare, I just don't want to be in clinical practice anymore. The continuous high levels of stress, inhumane long working hours, lack of sleep and under appreciation has left me burnt out, anxious and depressed.

This is not what I signed up for. The bureaucracy, the insane amount of monotonous paperwork and signing forms, the overbooked clinics where you're never satisfied that you've given the patient the time they deserve, the late night on calls, the stress affecting who you are as a person. The complete chaos of my sleep pattern with the stress of high expectations destroyed me mentally.

It's like they're running a fast food joint; get in as many customers as possible, quality comes second.

I only began to realize all this after being diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It was the worst feeling I had ever experienced in my life. It affected every aspect of my life. My work, my family life, my sleep .I cannot  think of a worse feeling than waking up in the morning feeling your heart pounding and you feel so vulnerable and worried.

I know , in my mind that what I was feeling were irrational thoughts. I kept trying to tell myself its ok, you know its going to be fine. but i just can't shake that feeling off.

Some days were better than others, some days I could control it, and go through my daily routine, but I could still feel it suppressed in the background.

Other days , I felt like I wanted to die, that I can't face the world, that I can't do it, that I want to quit my job . its a horrible horrible feeling. its like you're tied down and can't do anything about it.



I finally began to understand the root cause of my anxiety. It was directly related to my work.

It reached a point where I had a mental breakdown at work. I had a panic attack, I was sobbing in my on call room talking to my fiance, telling her I can't do this anymore.
The next day I asked for an emergency leave, followed by a 2 month leave.

I needed time to sort myself out, to get just step back and get away from it all, to figure out how I can get better. This job was definitely affecting me in a serious way. All I knew at that point is that I can't continue doing what I'm doing. Something had to change, because I can't continue living my life with this anxiety and depression, something was wrong with me and I had to fix it.

I thought about what I'm doing with my life. I asked myself if this what I want do for the rest of my life, the answer was no. That was the easy part. The hard part was “so what do you want to do?” 

It was difficult.. there were so many factors involved:

Finance: I had to be able to make at least the same amount of money I do now

Family &amp; Friends: The minute you tell them you want to quit medicine for anything else, they think you've lost your mind. 

Myself: What is it that I would enjoy doing, that I can see being really good at
what I can use the skills I've acquired for.. something with regular working hours, no every other weekend and over nights.

I wanted to do something along the lines of healthcare management/ Healthcare IT/Technology, maybe get an MBA in Healthcare or a healthcare MSc in a few years.. That was the general idea.

But where do I start? who do I talk to? do I just tell my job that I want to quit? do I look for a job first? where do I even look? How do I continue to support myself while I try to make this transition?

I thought maybe i could ask to be transferred to the hospital administration, start out there , and see what I can do from there. I know another dr who did the same. I talked to my hospital about and they made it clear that this was not going to happen. Looking back in retrospect, Im glad that didnt work out.


Then i thought of doing a MSc, .. but who would fund it, how would I support myself and my newly wed wife for a year or 2 ? Impossible..

All I knew was that whatever happens there's no way I can go back to doing calls. I can't go back to being in that fragile anxious depressed state again. Even if I have to continue working as a Dr I have to change something.


A few months later, something amazing happened. I came across a job post that was looking for Doctors to work for a large Health IT company, to implement EHRs. I liked the sound of it. I had experience in implementing an EHR in my last hospital, I love technology, and the hours were amazing.

Its now been 1 year since Ive embarked on this new career. I have to say when I accepted their offer, I decided to take a ""leap of faith"" and see where it takes me. I have no regrets today.

medicine,Rant on Rosen's Emergency Medicine,"Having the privilege of going through this text in detail recently, I've come to the conclusion that this is the worst textbook I've ever read.   

1. The editing is terrible (for example, the alveolar gas equation is wrong as are almost all math equations in the textbook, there are 3 completely different sets of tetanus prophylaxis recommendations in different places in the text, figures and tables are routinely mislabelled with columns switched, etc.)  
2. The material is often extremely outdated and flat-out incorrect or even dangerous in some places (references often haven't been updated since the 1980s)  
3.  The text is frequently sexist and derogatory (homosexual panic, a condition that hasn't been a real diagnosis since the DSM-1, is included as a cause of a violent patient)  

This is in addition to the generally inconsistent organization and tone throughout the text.

Why is this textbook considered authoritative by anyone? I actually find it to be a bit of an embarrassment to the specialty of emergency medicine.",15,32,2016-02-05,PHARMA,0.2131669670343399,0.7662336230278015,0.020599378272891045

**Hospital scalpers inflict distress on sick in China**

By Gilliam Collinsworth Hamilton, NSBO

A crowd gathered around the entrance to the Beijing Guang’anmen hospital. In the centre stood a young woman with an out-of-town accent, according to a video posted on Tengxun Xinwen, a Chinese news and video site.
Like many in the crowd, the woman had travelled to Beijing to see a doctor. But she found too late that she could not pay the scalper’s fee for admittance. Her voice grew hysterical. “This is the great Beijing,” she shouts. “If I die at home today, it would be because our society is hopeless. This is Beijing. This is our capital.”

Generally speaking, the hospitals in China operate on a first-come, first-serve basis. You show up and wait in line to see a doctor. In larger facilities, patients pay a fee to take a ticket (“Now serving number 205”) to ensure that patients stick around and don’t waste doctors’ time. But in practice, this system facilitates scalping and price gouging.

It’s not unusual to see dozens of scalpers milling around in front of a closed hospital door in the small hours of the morning, so that they can rush to the ticket booth as soon as it opens several hours later. It can take less than 30 minutes for the scalpers to claim a full day’s worth of tickets. Then they spend the rest of the day selling them outside the hospital entrance at a premium.

The woman from China’s north east, who needed to see a doctor claimed that the scalper was asking for Rmb4,500 ($684) for a ticket with a face value of Rmb300 ($45). She also accused the hospital’s security guards of facilitating the scalpers, reserving tickets for scalpers in exchange for a fee.

When the scene described above was recorded and uploaded on Chinese social media, it went viral. Then others began sharing similar stories. An expectant mother recounted how she had to wait hours in line, only to be told by the hospital office that she lacked the required documentation to be given a ticket. Those behind her told her the red tape was an excuse, and that she’d have to pay a scalper Rmb1,200 ($182) to be allowed through.

She also claimed that anyone who tried to camp overnight for a ticket would be chased off by scalpers to preserve their monopoly access to tickets. This was corroborated by a security guard, according to Beijing News, a local newspaper, who painted himself as a victim often harassed himself by scalpers.

Another guard added that considering his position’s monthly salary of Rmb3,000 ($450), he wouldn’t be surprised if certain guards are collaborating with the scalpers. Beijing is an expensive city.

Officially, of course, such transactions are illegal. Last summer, Beijing police launched an anti-scalping campaign, resulting in the arrest of 130 people. That the practice continues unhindered underscores its profitability. While ticket scalping itself is banned, there is no requirement for hospitals to verify ticket holders. Hospital administrators say that it’s not their job to enforce the law and that they lack the resources to tackle the problem.

The healthcare system itself is riddled with corruption, as underpaid doctors supplement their meagre salaries from drug companies, sometimes doubling a Rmb10,000 ($1,500) monthly salary, according to several reports in Chinese state media.

The government has vowed to wean hospital budgets off of drug revenues but have yet to provide a fully thought-out alternative. The Ministry of Finance has also slashed public hospital reform subsidies by 12 per cent for 2016, but could have the effect of squeezing doctors further. The State Council has vowed to address healthcare remuneration policies by 2020, and the scenes at Beijing Guang’anmen reveal the urgency of such plans.

medicine,What was your best moment in medicine?,"Hello everyone, I'm a biology/pre-med student, and by this time in two years I hope to be accepted into medical school.

I understand that some doctors are definitely jaded, but there has to be some satisfaction to what you do, and if you can tell me your best moment in medicine, or even a time that made your career choice even slightly bearable, I would definitely appreciate if you would share.

I personally don't see that I would but I would definitely like to hear as many opinions as possible before I commit 100% to obgyn.

Had a patient, only in his 50s, in who presented with weight loss &amp; lethargy. He's cachexic &amp; yellow. He says that 3 months ago, had an ultrasound of his liver that showed masses. He chose not to get them biopsied.

Instead, he went to his Naturopath who put him on a vegan diet &amp; had him do ""liver cleanses"". Apparently they took bloods (not idea what for).

So naturally we put him in a CT scanner, find a mass in his colon &amp;
a ""honeycomb"" liver, full of masses. Patient thought he must have done something wrong, didn't follow the diet correctly, and that's why the cancer spread.

This patient is now going to die from his cancer, and probably pretty soon. Would he have died anyway? Possibly (not sure what the biopsy has shown). But instead someone has taken his money &amp; fooled him into false hope, and I'm pretty livid but I don't know what to do about it.

medicine,Advocacy feels good.,"So a corpsman rates somewhere between a CNA, paramedic, and LPN. Not exactly the next Hippocrates, but you get a good amount of background in medicine and you're expected to do a lot for your patients. 

Right now I'm working in a sleepy MH ward where nothing really happens. Patients come in, I take vitals, they see their provider, they get a follow-up. It's groundhog day every day and the most corpsmen are supposed to do are behavioural assessments on acute psychiatric cases.

We had a patient come in yesterday who seemed a bit off. When I went through my little question script, something about the way he answered just set off alarm bells in my head. His replies were delayed, heavy, there was some unusual confusion. His breathing was laboured and something wasn't right. 

So I stopped the script and started asking him about his breathing. He'd been in a state of deteriorating dyspnea for four days, febrile at 102f for a week, long history of pulmonary embolisms. While he was describing this I hooked him up to a BP cuff and took a reading. It held low at 90~/70~, but his heart rate was 134. I waited a minute, took it over palp, and even carotid was so weak that I could barely perceive it enough to confirm that it was raising.

So I went across the hall to our PACU and tried to grab an idle nurse or doc. Explained the situation and my findings and asked them to come double check. Nobody would do so. With him being geriatric and the timespan on the dyspnea I was thinking pneumothorax so I asked to borrow a stethoscope. Left lobes were noticeably weaker but he didn't have any TD and O2 sat was bad but not critically so.

Now our doctors are officers, so arguing with them doesn't usually end well because there's an overarching layer of military hierarchy on top of the educational difference. I went to his psychiatrist, a great guy who knew I had a civilian background in medicine, with a print out of his last year in vitals showing a 40 point HR increase over every other appointment and said that I was really concerned about the guy. He was hesitant but I kept pressing that this wasn't a case I felt comfortable with and that I wanted him in the ER immediately. 

Doc takes him back, sees the same things I did, tries to get a pulse over carotid palp, can't detect one. Calls me over and gives me permission to run the patient downstairs. 

He's there as fast as I can drag him, but the front desk won't let me through. I show them my findings and the doctor's collaboration, request immediate triage, and he's not taking me seriously. My doc calls down and chews him out, he pages the triage nurse to come out, and she too is reluctant to assign any gravity to the situation. But I keep reiterating what I saw and how it was noticeably worse than when we did intake 30 minutes prior. She brings him through the double doors and that's that.

I'm a nurse practitioner working in primary care. I have an elderly patient who suffers from extreme anxiety and prolonged grief reaction after the sudden passing from her son. The one thing that seems to bring her joy, comfort, and a sense of calm is her dog. 

Her dog is able to live with her without issue, but I think she would benefit from the ability to take her dog with her wherever she goes. Has anyone else written for an emotional assistance dog? Is there a special protocol or website I need to go to? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

medicine,GCS 3 in a major polytrauma... any survivability at all?,"Paramedic student here. Just responded to my first serious trauma and I have a few questions about what may have happened with my patient after we dropped him off!


So quick story:
Male in his early 30's struck by a garbage truck at 100km/h presents on scene GCS 3 with some respiratory effort and a weak radial pulse. Primary survey found a depressed skull fracture to the forehead, significant oral trauma and bleeding, bilateral rib fractures, stable pelvis and proximal humerus fracture.

Tx:

 We didn't do a lot for this guy other than rapid extrication, immobilization and transport (scene time approx 5 mins, 7 to hospital). We attempted intubation en route without success and established an 18 gauge IV in his left AC. We gave approximately 150ml of normal saline on our short drive.

Last set of vitals were HR 66, BP 84/44 and respiratory rate of 6, shallow and irregular, GCS 3.

So here are my questions:


1.) From what research I have encountered GCS 3 in major polytrauma approaches 100% mortality. Any body have any good articles on this? Curious if anyone recovers from this type of massive trauma.

2.) In resus they established bilateral chest tubes, intubated and put him on a ventilator, established another IV and began running fluids, blood products and a vasopressor. What happens next? Assuming he doesn't arrest in the next 1-24 hours, what treatment options are available? How is viability determined if he is able to be stabalized on a ventilator etc.

3.) We were ventilating him with a BVM on scene but bubbles were escaping from the fracture on his forehead, I thought about taping it shut since air was escaping to try and improve ventilation but decided against it.

I don't think I can link redirect where the title link goes now, so here is the link here. It is only one of many popular media articles about this - http://www.boston.com/news/2016/02/25/family-justina-pelletier-sues-boston-children-hospital/IO8piSdPhUKV4FeCw0viBO/story.html

I had almost forgotten about this until today, when I saw this article. Brief backstory: a US teenage girl was under treatment at Tufts for mitochondrial disease. While at Children's Boston for an appointment, she was re-diagnosed by another provider as having a psychosomatic disorder, and Children's basically accused the girl's parents of Munchausen-by-proxy for encouraging the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease and its associated tests/procedures/medications. Children's reported the case to authorities for medical child abuse. The teenage girl was taken into custody of family services for a year and a half, and I gather placed in a psychiatric ward. Now her family desires financial compensation from Children's for their suffering.

(I'm not clear on what type of mitochondrial disease she was diagnosed with, so there's that. - sounds like it could be MNGIE? https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mitochondrial-neurogastrointestinal-encephalopathy-disease)

It seems to me that some criteria are likely double and triple counting coronary artery disease, by acting as surrogates. 

1. Severe renal disease- Why is this in the criteria?  Is this because it is presumed to be vascular disease causing renal disease which is a surrogate for heart disease?  Is it because of problems handling volume in the operative period?  Does someone with ESRD from inherited polycystic kidney disease or autoimmune disease have the same operative risk as a person with ESRD from diabetes and HTN?

2. Diabetes requiring insulin- This is a surrogate for coronary disease, no?

3. CVA- Why is stroke broken out separately?  It appears likely to be another surrogate for coronary disease. Does someone with a random ruptured aneurysm really have the same operative risk as someone with HTN, hyperlipidemia and stroke?

4- Peripheral Vascular disease- if we're counting CAD surrogates, how is this not on the list?

pharmacy,How do I deal with a difficult customer without looking unprofessional?,"Everyone who works in pharmacy or retail in general knows that we get a few crazies every now and again. This lady called asking why her automatic refills weren't ready and I said because they are out of refills and we can only automatically refill the refills that are actually available. She said that it's our job to contact her Dr. when the refills run out and that I've failed to do my job. According to her, our recording (no idea what she's talking about) says we will get more refills if she's out...and I said we could, but she would have to let me know she needed more refills and then I'll be able to contact the Dr. 
She kept making references to that recording and I got sassy right back to her and said ""I didn't make the recording. It's something put in place by corporate. Whatever it said is not how it works, so I'm telling you right now how it works..."" 

In the moment, I felt good for sticking up for myself, but looking back, I feel like I just looked immature and unprofessional.
