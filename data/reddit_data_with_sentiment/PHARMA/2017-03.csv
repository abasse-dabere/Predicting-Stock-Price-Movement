medicine,"Current MD's, what is the best way for a concerned nurse to question your order?","MD's have gone through years of education and have expansive knowledge in the various aspects of medicine. As a nurse, I am very aware that my education is less than theirs and do not pretend to think otherwise. We are all important members of the healthcare team, but most of you know, the nurse has a unique position when it comes to patient care. We are the primary advocates for our patients and are the last safety net against potential accidental medical errors. I wanted to know what the best way to go about questioning an order if it does not seem to be appropriate for what the patient requires or I do not understand why a certain unorthodox treatment is being prescribed. I know that some MD's, especially new residents, get offended when a nurse acts like they know more than them and questions them. My question is what is the most respectful way to go about asking for clarification without them assuming I think I am some sort of nurse know-it-all? Also how do you feel about a nurse wanting to ask you for more information about why you did something, purely out of curiosity? I really enjoy learning more about how doctors think so I can better prepare for what they might ask of me in the future.

medicine,"Update: Having some issues with a nurse, could use some advice.","Original post [here.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/5sybwu/having_some_issues_with_a_nurse_could_use_some/)

I was asked to give an update on this issue when available, so here it is, in chronological order. 

- I sent that letter to the nursing supervisor, she didn't say anything back. 

- Union rep spoke to nurse and told her to clean up her act. She did, for like a day. Now it's all back to normal.

- The whole team had a ""team building"" meeting in which we were told to be ""nice to one another"" and not ""say things behind each others' backs"" and were also told ""not to document against each other"" and ""if we have a problem with someone to go to that person directly and if that doesn't work to talk to our supervisor.""

- To be honest, that last bit about not ""documenting against each other"" seemed to be a jab at me. 

- Issues are still quite extensive, and I've (unfortunately) reached at a point where I no longer care... sort of. 

- If they ask me to switch clinics, I will probably quit. Not because they're making me switch clinics, but because they're punishing me and my patients, and they're protecting an employee that has been incredibly inappropriate and incompetent. This is a culture in which I have no desire to partake. 

Sorry I don't have great news for you, reddit. You've all been very helpful and supportive. 

In all honesty (not just because of this) - I'm feeling pretty burnt out. I feel like I no longer care about the work that I do. There's no incentive to work harder. I don't feel heard. I don't feel valued. I'm bored. I don't feel like a physician. It's getting pretty hard to get out of bed and go to work. I dread it every single day, and it sucks, because I'm actually pretty great at what I do. Or I used to be, I guess. 

I don't know why I added that last paragraph. I guess I just needed to tell someone who - perhaps - understands where I'm coming from and has some useful advice.

medicine,Is medicine becoming a big business/corporate run career? Worried about becoming a physician.,"I work as a medical assistant in an urgent care, and I have recently begun to really hate my job. We work long 12 hour shifts that are often understaffed, which leads to us being overworked. We get paid $12.50 an hour, which is more than any job i've had before, but not enough to make me feel well compensated for the amount of labor I put in each day. Scheduling often involves back to back shifts, and I just recently finished four 12 hour shifts in a row, and felt miserable with minimal personal time off. 

I often feel as though ""corporate"" does not care about their employees. It has been often said by physicians and other coworkers that this company preys on the newly grads because they can pay them much less than someone who is actually trained to deal with the patients we see. A lot of the new hires are X-ray techs who are being crossed trained as medical assistants, and have never administered any injectable medications or received any formal training besides, ""on the job"". But this leads to some pretty bad quality control, as most people did not receive formal training either, and many learn improper ways to handle sharps/injections. 

For an example, I was never trained to do IV's but I have started four already since starting, and I'll never forget the first time I declined because I ""didn't feel confident"" and the look of disgust from my supervisors. 

I also don't feel as though corporate really cares about the patients. They explicitly tell providers to Rx antibiotics and limited quantity of narcotics to patients. I've been told by physicians that this is because it will lead to more visits and more money from insurances. 

I would like to one day become a doctor, possibly an emergency room physician. But I'm worried that the hospitals are no better than this urgent care, and I'm not certain whether I will enjoy my job working in such an environment. 

I love listening to my patients, I love working with a great group of people, and I love almost all of the experiences that I have learned from as a medical assistant. But I hate the thought that the company i work for does not care about me, or our patients, but rather how much money they can bill the insurance.",118,125,2017-03-03,PHARMA,0.08383603394031525,0.8850142955780029,0.031149664893746376

medicine,Elderly patient (70 years old) with type 2 diabetes - At what point would Sulfonylureas (gliclazide) no longer work for a patient whose Type 2 Diabetes have progressed? How effective is Gabapentin and Pregabalin for Neuropathic pain?,"I volunteer in a Community Clinic, working with the pharmacist, and we have a patient who has neuropathic pain (taking gabapentin and pregabalin), diabetes (taking long acting insulin, metformin, gliclazide), restless leg syndrome (prameprexole), and hypertension (on a ACE inhibitor). She is also obese and is on other miscellaneous drugs. 

She came into the clinic today because she is unable to afford her medication. This makes her adherence poor - ironically to the drugs she needs the most. Upon further questioning she also has trouble affording food, and necessities for living a quality life. 

I looked into Seniors Pharmacare (I am from Canada) for her, and she is a candidate... which is great. She will save some money for that.

I am also doing a medication review to see if there is any medications that she shouldnt be on, either due to lack of evidence, or the drugs are no longer worth their benefit. 

I remember during my endocrine unit that as T2 diabetes progresses the insulin secreting cells begin to die, and give out, and eventually insulin secreting agents will no longer work - due to not having the beta cells to release it in the first place.

 I noticed the patient is on insulin, and I am wondering if at some point insulin secreting agents will no longer work for the patients with progressed T2 diabetes. If so, how would you know (is there lab values you could look for) when the patient is at that point. I am interested in this because I want to know if her Gliclazide is providing any benefit, and if not, she could get off the medication, and avoid any unnecessary adverse effects and cost. 

I looked for primary literature with some luck, but not satisfactory. 

I am wondering if anyone has experience with this situation in practice, or if anyone has heard of any studies that address this clinical question.

Also, does anyone have any insight on the efficacy for Gabapentin and Pregabalin for diabetic neuropathic pain?",23,15,2017-03-03,PHARMA,0.06789274513721466,0.9057467579841614,0.026360442861914635

Also, after receiving a lot of RN feedback, and less physician feedback, Dr. Edelstein wrote [this response piece published on Psychology Today.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/patient-power/201703/touching-very-raw-nerve) 

My thoughts, he does seemed to have taken what the RNs said to heart and apologizes for the yelling, and tones down his rhetoric.  However, he still hasn't taken the time to read an Up to date article or any other literature on the management of TIAs, because he hasn't apologized for calling the work up ""poor quality"", ""substandard"", not meeting ""guidelines"".

medicine,"What subtle signs tip you off to a problem patient, which were not obvious to you early in your career?","We were all warned in medical / graduate school that we'd face malingerers, drug seekers, emotional vampires, and people looking for someone to sue for the money. But that all seemed so far away and irrelevant at the time. Sure enough, most of what I'm learning about [the small minority of] patients who make my job hard, I'm learning about the hard way. This includes the fact that there are many more types of problem patients -- and ways that they can make my job more difficult than it needs to be -- than I'd been warned about.

I'm near the beginning of my career, but I'll start with a few clues that raise a red flag for me. **I'd like to ask that everyone who replies be specific about the sign, and what type of problem you've found it portends.**

* A relatively healthy patient bringing me enormous thick stacks, hundreds to thousands of sheets, of old records by hand, the first visit. I've learned the hard way that this is usually the calling card of someone who is very frustrated by the lack of relief or answers they've gotten about a specific complaint. I find it's necessary to be completely upfront about how I intend to approach a complaint like theirs, including the fact that while I appreciate them bringing them and saving me having to reinvent the wheel, I will not (nay, cannot *possibly*) read every page of their old records word for word. If this gets me a nasty look, I often have to break it to them that quite likely no one ever has, or ever will, read their old records like a novel rather than a reference book, and any healthcare provider who tells you otherwise is telling you a comforting lie.
* If I start to get frustrated trying to get a straight answer about the time course of the HPI, particularly which symptoms are old and unchanged vs. new or worsening, and how quickly and in what order they set in. I've found this is often a sign of an unaddressed mental health problem (especially dementia or covert substance abuse). The words ""poor historian"" will go into my note, and I'll ask their permission to speak to a family member about their health, and have one present for any future visits if possible.
* When a patient indicates during their first visit that they're used to the care available in a big coastal metropolis or world-class medical center which is a household name nationwide. I've learned the hard way that these are the patients I have to set very realistic expectations for regarding the turnaround time for results, referrals, and meds being available for pickup at the pharmacy, and *never* exceed these timeframes.
* When a patient spends much of the initial visit complaining about the care they received from their former PCPs, unless their last PCP was a notorious quack. You know what they say about people who'll gossip *to* you ...
* When I put a patient on an SSRI, I always have them follow up in 3-4wks. I've learned the hard way that if they tell me, ""I stopped taking that after 2 days. It made me dizzy (or nauseous)."", then I'm usually dealing with someone who doesn't want to be on an antidepressant, and didn't know how to communicate that to me.
* When a patient gives off a dissatisfied vibe to me, it's often my staff they have beef with. And vice versa. Whenever a member of the office staff, clinical or clerical, complains to me that a patient of mine was rude to them, I always make it a point to call the patient myself, if possible promptly and in the presence of the offended staff member, to hear them out and find a solution. And to let them know, kindly but firmly, that I have a policy of firing patients who repeatedly are jerks to my staff.",422,266,2017-03-04,PHARMA,0.13952063024044037,0.8364282250404358,0.024051185697317123

pharmacy,How much info do you require before filling controlled (specifically pain) medication?,"Located in California.

At my retail pharmacy our store requires all C-II we require a DL number of the patient at either drop off or pick up and any and all controlled pain medications that have a moderately high quantity or are monthly pain meds will require an ICD-10 code  to describe the dx to be put into the patients profile.  The latter is the newest ""rule"" implemented before allowing to be filled which I don't mind personally, but when I usually pick up shifts after I'm at the hospital and all the offices are closed people get irritated which I don't mind since I know my pharmacist is just playing it safe.  

This just got me wondering what protocols other pharmacies have regarding their controlled medications.  We also only fill the day the patient is actually due (which I love) and never early.

medicine,"In a world where we acknowledge the biological basis of psychiatric disease, why do people get so offended by the suggestion that their physical symptoms are psychosomatic?","I would really like to see a professional discussion about this without ridiculousness ending up in a locked thread like the last one. 

It seems obvious to me that many people suffer from somatiform disorders. Fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, people diagnosed with ""chronic Lyme,"" etc. I truly don't understand, though, why it's so unacceptable to point to psychiatric causes. By getting offended, people are just perpetuating the stereotype that psychiatric disorders aren't ""real"" medical problems. As if they are being dismissed by being told it's somatiform. Somehow people can't accept that that doesn't translate to made up or fake. 

Our emotions and psychology have so much control over our physical beings, because they're really all one and the same. Heck, my own husband has a somatic movement disorder -- he gets awful, myoclonic-like tics and movements when he's very upset. It's obviously psychiatric but he can't help it. It's possible to accept psych as an etiology without suggesting he can just snap out of it or stop at will.

I'd love to see a discussion among medical professionals about this. Not patients who are offended. I don't know the current literature on these things (it's obviously not relevant to my field) and would love to know what's out there about somaticization and whether there's any way to know if the incidence has increased in recent years.",142,265,2017-03-07,PHARMA,0.3004780411720276,0.680076003074646,0.019446048885583878

pharmacy,Comment from a pharmacy customer,"I usually use the drive through, but needed a couple other items and picked up a prescription at the pharmacy counter this evening. It was busy, but not insane- constant drive through flow, about 3-4 other indoor customers. 

Standing there, I realized that each and every customer interaction was.. not going smoothly. For one reason or another, each order was complicated in some way (""I was also supposed to have a script for x ready,"" ""Its only supposed to cost $10,"" etc). Majority of the customers were quickly irate, impatient, and/or downright rude. 

Watching what I can only assume is a typical night at the pharmacy made me realize how much undeserved shit y'all get. It's almost as if every fill has a built-in frustration for the customer (i.e. ""Sorry, Insurance won't cover that,"" ""your doc says you can't fill early,"" etc). Many of these seem like failure to achieve unrealistic customer expectations rather than pharmacy incompetence. 

So anyhow, hopefully what I encountered tonight was anomalous. You guys do important and challenging work.

pharmacy,"PBM pharmacists, how does your plan handle prior authorization requests that the office clearly lied on?","I work for a small PBM and have encountered some PA requests where the office has lied on the form to try to obtain approval. Hence, if they know a patient must try and fail a medication prior to the requested drug being approved they just write that the patient has or even in some cases lie about the indication.

I'll provide my most recent example. A PA was submitted for Victoza for a type 2 diabetes patient who did not have a history of trying any antidiabetics. I requested medical records which they sent and found that they wanted to use Victoza to treat the patient's obesity rather than diabetes (which was not even listed as a diagnosis in the chart). It's clear to me that they knew Saxenda wouldn't be covered since weight loss drugs are not a benefit under the plan, thus they just tried for Victoza instead.

medicine,Help a med student understand what patients are talking about when they say they have Ehlers Danlos syndrome?,"This keeps coming up on Facebook, in casual conversations with people outside of work and I'll occasionally see it in 20-30 year old patients' problem lists. My understanding of Ehlers Danlos from medical school is that it's a large group of RARE genetic disorders having something to do with interrupting collagen production or synthesis. Uptodate has some pretty specific clinical criteria for suspecting each of the six subtypes, for example very smooth or very fragile skin, chronic joint dislocations/subluxations, life-threatening vascular or visceral rupture, or kyphoscoliosis or other severe skeletal abnormalities. There is a list of very specific clinical criteria for defining ""joint hypermobility"" that goes way beyond the usual doublejointedness seen in healthy folks. 

The only link I can see here between the increasing numbers of healthy-appearing young people from healthy families without hypermobile joints or devastating medical histories (I'm talking about friends I have known for decades here, and I grew up in a place where folks know everybody's business) and Ehlers Danlos syndromes are the part about it potentially causing musculoskeletal pain. Uptodate does note that chronic joint pain in EDS III can resemble fibromyalgia. Oh, and a lot of people seem to receive these diagnoses through nonmedical practitioners (i.e. naturepaths) or in the absence of tissue biopsy or a genetics consult. Am I misunderstanding the rarity, severity and diagnostic criteria of these disorders?

medicine,Being crushed by the Texas Medical Board- Any advice?,"I'm a recent medical school grad having some issues with the TMB. I'm keeping a lot of this as anonymous as possible for obvious reasons.

When I applied for a texas license for residency I disclosed that I had a past alcohol problem. In truth, I'd been completely sober for about six months before moving to Texas and relatively sober (just social) for a while before that. My drinking in the past was very closely related to life circumstances (the death of a loved one and unemployment, specifically). 

I met with the physician health program and they initially put me on a one year 'contract' without much recognizing my individual situation. If any of you have experienced this, these contracts are completely rigid with no wiggle room. Here's what I have to do, on an intern salary and with an intern schedule:

-Anywhere from 4 to 8 random (I find out the morning of) drug tests a month
-Mandated 4 hours of meetings a week (AA, which is depressing and useless for me)
-Monthly appointments with psychologists and psychiatrists (Not a bid deal, I was seeing these providers anyway)
-Fees totalling about $700 a month from drug tests (again, on an intern salary), the physician health program fees, and the outside contracted psychiatrist (different from my own provider) that they make me see.

When I contacted them to see if there was anything to do about this, their response was basically 'tough luck. Also, your contract has been extended to five years'.

I feel like I have no one to advocate for me in my situation. My mental health providers aren't of any help, even though my official diagnosis is 'alcohol abuse disorder in complete remission' and I'm literally going without food some nights because I can't afford it. It's not hyperbole, I do peanut butter and graham crackers like in med school. it's also more than a little humiliating having some guy watch me piss into a cup 1-2 times a week. My work performance is suffering too, as I can't attend a couple post-work meetings due to AA requirements and staff in the ICU don't take too kindly to an intern having to leave work for an hour once a week. Thankfully, my program director has been incredibly understanding and helpful.

I've lost about 30 pounds that I didn't have and am more stressed out by being broke and having to deal with my colleagues wondering where I go (so far I've told them that I have a condition that makes it so that I have to have labs drawn on a set schedule). It's killing my mental health more than anything else and I'm seriously questioning leaving this profession I love because of it, which is something I'd never thought I'd consider.

I guess I should have mentioned, I've passed every single drug test they've had me do (two hair follicle tests and several dozen urine tests). My work performance reviews are stellar and I'm track for chief resident.

Is there anything I can do?

EDIT:

I should add, since someone asked: I've never been in any legal or professional trouble, this was all pre-medicine. Medicine helped me kick my alcohol problem because I felt so fulfilled in my work.

EDIT2, Edit harder:

I guess to clarify some more, I'm not trying to evade any questions. This has literally never impacted anything to do with my job. I sought help of my own volition and not as a consequence. I tried outpatient rehab, but psychiatry for depression helped me much more.

I disclosed this information to the board because lying to the people your livelihood depends on can be dumb, especially when the consequences of them finding out (though the chance may be slim) would leave me jobless, unemployable, and 200k in debt.",83,82,2017-03-08,PHARMA,0.07991722971200943,0.8863003849983215,0.03378238156437874

medicine,Need advice: patient continually badmouths practice on Facebook group,"Ok, here is the situation:

I belong to a local community Facebook group where community members post questions or comments about the community.  Frequently, these posts are about looking for local services like a roofer, house cleaning service, baby sitter.  Not uncommonly, people will look for recommendations for a doctor.  One day, I happen to see a post from a patient in my practice where the person says she is not happy with my practice but doesn't post any details.  This patient does have a frustrating medical problem that we are trying to work through. I don't recall that her visit was difficult or that we had a bad interaction, but I figure maybe someone in my front office staff upset her, or she was upset about a long wait.  I don't post any response and have my nurse check in with her.  She leaves a message but never gets a response back.  I'm thinking that she has moved on.  I'm surprised to see that she comes back to see me again.  She tells me that she got a second opinion that was the same opinion as I had given her.  I redouble my efforts to try to make her care as smooth as possible.  She doesn't seem upset or irritated or unhappy during her visit.  We are still working through her issues.  After that visit, I again see that she has posted that she is frustrated and having problems with me (names me by name).  I check, and sure enough, she has a follow up visit still on my schedule.      


So, my question is this: I know there is probably very little utility in putting up a response on the Facebook post.  It's a community Facebook group not my practice's Facebook page.  I understand she is probably frustrated with her medical issues and is transferring that frustration onto me.  But, it's very frustrating to see this when I'm really trying my best for this patient.  Is there any point in bringing up the Facebook posts with the patient or should I just be very general and ask the patient what else we can do to make her experience better (and not mention Facebook at all)?  I get the feeling that the patient is very casual about posting her opinions on Facebook, not realizing that those posts can be seen by the target of the or how distressing it might be.  Does anyone have any advice on how to manage or deal with negative Facebook posts?      


I get that though we may try our best, you can't please everyone.  Some people are just unhappy, frustrated people, and we as physicians are the target of their frustration.  Still, it's getting harder to hide my resentment towards these posts, and I fear that at some point, it will interfere with her care.

pharmacy,Does anybody else try to re-set patient/customer expectations?,"With how terrible the hours at our retail chain have been slashed over the past 3-5 years I feel like some patient expectations are becoming ridiculous.  These include 10-15 minute wait times on certain scripts at certain times of day, calling MD's when they don't respond on refill requests or PAs, calling to verify an issue on the script while a customer waits, contacting the insurance company for billing info while the customer waits, etc.

I feel like the only store in my district which is actively trying to re-set expectations.  If you drop your 2 regular Adderall prescriptions off at 430 PM on a Monday its going to be more than 15 minutes.  If you don't have your insurance card you as the customer must call them to get your billing info or we can call at a later time.  If your prior authorization still isn't going through you as the patient should be the one calling your doctor every day to harass them until they work on it.  If you want a prescription delivered you should call it in by at least 5 PM the night before deliveries go out.  But time and time again these customers just keep going to other stores in our district and my colleagues are so afraid of complaints that they do these things.

medicine,"Would this work? Billionaire Mark Cuban proposes national insurance for chronic or catastrophic issues, regular insurance for everything else","I realize most doctors aren't policy makers or insurance people, but this seems like an [interesting proposal](http://blogmaverick.com/2017/03/08/some-thoughts-on-fixing-obamacare-shoot-holes-in-this-please/).

In a nutshell:

&gt; Whether its Medicaid or a new program, every single person in this country should be covered 100pct for chronic physical or mental illness and for any life threatening injury.  

&gt; Everything not covered by the above can be covered by insurance sold on the Free Market, managed by the states, sold across state lines, without government interference.

Is it really possible to separate out risk pools like that? It seems like [most healthcare dollars go into chronic and catastrophic issues anyway](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/cost-of-chronic-disease-1.aspx):

&gt; Chronic health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer and kidney disease account for more than 75 percent of the nation's $2.7 trillion in annual spending [in 2011, more like $3.2T now] for medical care, says Ursula Bauer of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

According to eSurance, health insurance for a family of four averages abut $10,000/year for an $8,000 deductible plan. There are about 125 million households in the US, with an average household size of about 2.5 persons, so that's not much more than $1 trillion. Medicare and Medicaid combined account for another $1 trillion or so. I'm not sure where the other $1 trillion comes from.

Healthcare spending averaged over all Medicare recipients is about $15,000 per year, 50% higher than the average over all Americans, because Medicare recipients are mostly older of course. The average for Medicaid enrollees is about $8,000 per year, somewhat less than the national average. There are 44 million Medicare and 70 million Medicaid enrollees, so 114 million Americans, or 35% of all Americans are already covered by these two agencies.

Taking all that into account, it seems like Cuban's plan could be an improvement over the current ""system"", and could be financially attractive to most people.",21,28,2017-03-10,PHARMA,0.027031412348151207,0.9368319511413574,0.03613666817545891

medicine,Help me understand why getting rid of ACA is a bad idea?,"In my understand, ACA program costs on average $300 - $400 for premium each month, totaling up to $3600 a year for a single non smoking individual. On top of that, the deductible can go up to $7000 a year. That means, if I needed medical care, I would have to spend $10600 out of pocket BEFORE my insurance kicks in. In that case, i would only benefit from insurance if I was in major car accident, pregnant, or cancer (from a young individual points of view of course)

My current health care plan right now is $3000 with deductible of $230. As I am a medical student with 0 income, I cringe every time I have to pay for blood test, CXR, or copay for doctor visit. I can't imagine what it's like for a young person, making minimum wage, not eligible for student loan to afford paying for health care under ACA policy. 

if I was under ACA and have to pay out of pocket $7k deductible a year, I would delay getting CXR, blood test, mammogram, pap smear and eventually might end up with late diagnose disease. 

So my question would be, why is it a bad idea to get rid of ACA?",56,74,2017-03-12,PHARMA,0.16959741711616516,0.8073316216468811,0.02307102084159851

pharmacy,Can you really trust your state board of pharmacy's addiction recovery program?,"Kind of a shocking question but I ask it for a reason. Check out this post from last week in /r/medicine

https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/5ybb51/being_crushed_by_the_texas_medical_board_any/

A recent medical school grad disclosed on his application that at one point he used to have an alcohol program and the state board of medicine has him an intense program that he cannot withdraw from. Why did he do this? Why did he tell the state licensing board that he had a problem with alcohol? He admitted to being sober for 6 months and had a support system in place.

I don't know if posting her name is a reddit violation (even though the court case is public record but whatever) so I'll just refer to this pharmacist as Jane Doe. Jane got her pharmacy license in Texas and then moved to North Carolina for a different position. Later in life she met the man of her dreams and married him. Two weeks later he was killed in a car crash. Jane was obviously a mess. Close to the one year anniversary of the crash she drank so much alcohol that she had to go to the hospital with a case of alcohol poisoning. One of her coworkers suggested a program called NCPRN (North Carolina Pharmacist Recovery Network) and she signed up with them voluntarily. Thanks to this program she never had another drink of alcohol since the incident. But that's where the problem began.

Her agreement with the network involved weekly meetings and once she accepted that she didn't need to drink anymore, she stopped going to the meetings but continued therapy with her doctor. NCPRN reported her to the state board of pharmacy. They told the board she was unfit for practice because she broke their agreement and suspended her license to practice pharmacy. The board would not allow her to reinstate the license without the NCPRN signing off on it and since she didn't feel like she needed the program anymore, that wasn't a possibility. 

With her husband passing away she had no family in North Carolina and lost her house due to foreclosure. She moved back to Texas with family and decided to start her life over again. She joined the Texas version of the NCPRN program voluntarily to continue therapy and was hired on as a pharmacist. Because her license in North Carolina was suspended, Texas suspended her license until the North Carolina suspension was lifted. She contacted North Carolina and had TxPRN advocate for her and it was denied. They wanted her to be enrolled in the NCPRN and said that her enrollment in TxPRN was not an acceptable substitute. 

She testified in court that she never abused alcohol or drugs while on the job nor did she use it after she enrolled in both NCPRN and TXPRN. It took the Texas Supreme Court to tell the board of pharmacy that their suspension of her license was arbitrary and capricious. Having said that, are these recovery programs really something pharmacists should take advantage of? Sounds like to me that pharmacists with alcohol and drug issues should consult with outside help before going to the board. I can't imagine developing an alcohol problem, getting sober and fully recovered, and have your license suspended because you have 5 more years of meetings left to attend. If she had contacted alcoholics anonymous without ever telling the board, none of this would have happened.

What are your thoughts on this topic? Do you know of anyone who had a bad experience with these programs?",8,41,2017-03-16,PHARMA,0.26256832480430603,0.716158390045166,0.021273326128721237

medicine,Ataxia - please explain,"I'm a neuroscience RN, just got NIHSS certified. The online certification class had a neurologist explaining the NIHSS and assessing several pts, then you had to assess 6 pts yourself. I have a question about ataxia.

From Googline and Youtubing, I picked up that ataxia means uncoordinated, jerky movements. Ataxic people look like they're trying to walk or perform actions on a shaking floor. Right?? The NIHSS tests for ataxia using finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin.

For the NIHSS cert, I figured if the pt's finger is jerking around, shaking, or unable to clearly contact finger or nose, or if their heel-to-shin movement was slow and jerky instead of smooth, that meant ataxia. Wrong. Even though I witnessed all the above in several of the NIHSS cert videos, none of them were scored as having ataxia. So now I'm wondering what a pt with NIHSS-scored ataxia actually looks like, and why the finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests are used if failing to perform tests still, apparently, doesn't score as ataxia.

pharmacy,"What are things a student turning pharmacist should be doing right now to prepare for having real income? (Finances, bank accounts, insurance, etc)","I'm sure there are plenty of us P4s turning pharmacist/resident in a few months. I feel like the checklist of things I need to start doing is huge and I keep forgetting things. Any advice from people who have done this before?

So far:

* **Licensure!** Whatever it is you need to do for this and the multiple states. Am I correct in that if you do multiple states, it is 1 NAPLEX total + [1 MPJE x Each State]? (Ex: Two states means 1 NAPLEX and 2 MPJE?). How does taking the MPJE for multiple states work? Can you take the exam out of state? Say, you are moving from Oregon to Nevada and getting licensed in both. Can you take both MPJEs before you move?

* **Insurance.** Liability and Disability. I was told by a financial adviser (who had nothing to gain out of it) to get as much disability insurance as possible.

* **Student Loans.** I was also told by a financial adviser to start paying the ones with the highest interest first, but that you should spend your extra money on your savings (IRA) rather than pay off your loans quicker. Also, see if you can get them consolidated.

* **Finances.** Pharmacists, how do you handle your finances? I was given advice on direct depositing my new income into a separate bank account and then setting an amount that is wired to my checking every month. Kind of like setting your own allowance. Any other tips?

* **Moving.** Especially if you are a resident who matched at a teaching facility, the medical residents are looking for housing right now too! Better for us to look sooner rather than later. Uhaul vs. doing it yourself, etc. May/June will be busy with college students moving away.

* **Credit.** Once you are getting a salary, request a higher credit limit for your credit card. Using &lt;30% is ideal, so the bigger your limit the easier that is. Just don't start using that bigger limit :)

What else do we need to do?

Edits:

* **401k.** Max your 401k and match what your employer will.

* **Emergency Fund.** 3-6 months of expenses.

* **Spending.** Start off being frugal, don't buy new cars/houses over your budget that you do not need.

* **Keep CV Updated.** Helps for keeping track of activities to either switch jobs or fill out performance evaluations.

We do have ketamine in stock, and occasionally use it (I've used it once in the last year) for that peri-arrest 'oh-shit' intubation on the wards). But generally, there's always a better alternative? Even the times I've used it, in retrospect, I could have used an alternative. With any of these unstable patients, why not just titrate phenylepherine (or your vasopressor of choice) against propofol or whatever your induction agent of choice is, to get a reliable, uncomplicated and predictable depth of anaesthesia, without the BP drop. It's been common practice for years, and with a bit of experience we learn to titrate (pressor and induction agent) pretty well, allowing us maintain perfusion even in very unstable patients.

Certain pts have massage coverage in their insurance policies, so we're having to do more itemised statements for insurance submission, and the owner of the clinic starting to consider looking into taking insurance directly. It's refreshing as a worker, but I can't help but to be curious. Is it due to actual belief in the benefits of the therapy, or the demands of pts? I wanted to incite discussion after seeing the post on chiropractic work, as we also work along side physical therapists and chiropractors, though I know chiropractic work tends to be side eyed. 

How likely are you to prescribe alternative therapies like massage, dry needling, chiro, etc? Are you open to it at all and if you are, why? Is this primarily due to pt demand, or a belief in the benefits of the therapies? Do you meet with alternative practitioners to discuss the benefits of their work? I mention specific therapies like massage, chiro and dry needling as they're practiced in clinical settings, where as woo like reiki, aromatherapy/essential oils, and anything really involving ""meridians"" isn't something that can be measured in a scientific setting. But, I know that the placebo effect can be powerful!",17,19,2017-03-19,PHARMA,0.04651671648025513,0.9298279285430908,0.023655427619814873
pharmacy,How to deal with pts that want to wait for prescriptions in the last hour of the pharmacy being open.,"I am a P2 intern and I work for Walgreens, the problem that I have constantly whenever I work is getting yelled at during the last hour of the pharmacy being open. 

Generally, when I am working it is just me and the pharmacist. The pharmacist is verifying, data entry, and doing some filling while I am working cash register and drive thru. When there is no one in the lobby or drive thru, I will data enter and fill. 

Scenario
(Customer comes in to the drive thru.)
Me: Hi welcome to Walgreens!

Customer: Here is my script, I want it as soon as possible.

Me: Okay!

(Look around and no one is currently in the lobby)

Me: We can have that ready in 20mins!

(Shit proceeds to hit the fan over the next 20mins, and all I have done is scanned the script)

(Customer returns)

Me: Sorry we are still working on it!

Customer: WHAT THE HELL IS TAKING SO LONG! YOU SAID 20 MINS! 

(notes to self not to say we can have it ready in 20mins)


(Customer comes in to the drive thru.)

Me: Hi welcome to Walgreens!

Customer: Here is my script, I want it as soon as possible.

Me: We close within the next hour, and we may not have it ready in time, but we can have it for you first thing tomorrow morning!

Customer: WHAT THE HELL MY DOCTOR TOLD ME I HAVE TO TAKE THIS TONIGHT! IT SHOULD ONLY TAKE 10 MINS! I LIVE AN HOUR FROM HERE AND I'M NOT DRIVING BACK! I NEED THIS NOW I AM DEATHLY ILL!

I feel like the way I am wording my response to patients is what sets them off. How do you all generally deal with customers coming in the last hour to minimize the amount of angry customers in the pharmacy. Many times I am able to get the customer their prescription ready but sometimes if I have to deal with some insurance issue or another unforeseen problem it just pushes the whole workflow backwards.",22,13,2017-03-19,PHARMA,0.10879908502101898,0.862883448600769,0.028317440301179886

medicine,What is the current medical understanding of transgenderism and what is the medical basis for this view?,"Hello medical professionals of reddit!

This is something I've wondered about for a while, but the recent post https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/60r2mt/maletofemale_transgender_athlete_sets_record/ brought the issue back to my mind. 

I know this is a very complicated issue, and in some cases the medicine may be intertwined with politics and other factors. However I'd be interested in hearing more about the biological aspects of this.

My personal view is not ""politically correct"" (IE these transitions undertaken by transsexuals are akin to prescribing testosterone or steroids to someone with muscle dysmorphia, or gastric bypass surgery for someone with anorexia). However I have relatively little medical understanding and I'd be interested in hearing if that view is ""medically incorrect"", and if so, why. I know there are disorders involving chromosomes, hormones, and more - but my understanding is that transgendered people frequently aren't trying to fix one of these abnormalities, but rather they are mostly biologically ""normal"" people using medicine to address a psychological need. Wikipedia simply says ""The DSM-5 refers to the topic as gender dysphoria while reinforcing the idea that being transgender is not considered a mental illness."" with no additional explanation as to *why*.

medicine,"How do you understand ""bad behavior"" from patients and family members? eg yelling, violence, histrionics, lying, self-entitlement, rudeness, etc.","Over the years, I've been getting better at *handling* bad behavior - putting boundaries, being firm, etc. But I still struggle with how to comprehend the behavior emotionally and intellectually. Philosophically, too, I guess.

Venting or complaining about a patient (not in front of  a them, of course) is frowned upon. When they act out, we're encouraged to understand where they're coming from. Patient or family is yelling at you? Well, it's stressful and scary to be in the hospital. Sickness changes you. Pain changes you. Patient being dramatic and needy? They're lonely, they feel a loss of control that they're trying to regain. We're supposed to seek understanding, not judgment.

A long time ago, there was a post on some subreddit asking about pregnant women's interactions with medical students while they're admitted. One woman mentioned how she punched a medical student in the chest while in active labor. Someone confronted her about how that is never an acceptable reaction, and then the entire thread devolved into a (from what I could guess) mostly laypeople vs health professionals debate/fight about how you can't hold it against people for becoming violent when they're in so much pain vs yes, you absolutely can. (I really wish I could find this post, but no success.)

Another favorite topic:  *those* drug addicts - the subset of addicts that are often referenced snidely in conversation - ""Tylenol doesn't work, but the one that starts with a D does."" Whenever I read a thread about how stressful/exhausting it is to work with them, there's always one or two commenters who scold others for being uncompassionate, that these addicts have a disease, etc. Same with working with patients with borderline personality disorder; they're manipulative because they suffered through some sort of trauma when they were younger, because they developed poor coping skills, etc, so if you express any annoyance about working with them, it reflects poorly on you.

I guess I'm trying to ask: can patients and their families ever just be shitty people? Does everything have to have a ""because..."" tacked on afterwards? Is it our duty as health professionals to mentally seek understanding of a person's bad behavior rather than just accept it at face value? Are we allowed to feel resentment or to be frustrated or to criticize them when they act the way they do?  

Not really sure where I'm going with this or if I expressed myself well. Just feeling overwhelmed by a patient's behavior today.

pharmacy,Pursuing Residency Tips,"As someone who just went through the process, I thought I would do a short write up on how to do it successfully. This includes things I wish I had done prior to the Match. Please feel free to contribute suggestions!

-----------------

**PreMatch**

* Update your CV constantly. Look at websites to help you make a strong CV. Have your favorite professors look over it. Use ASHP's CV review service for free.

* Keep a running list of all activities, volunteering, awards, committees, projects, etc. from rotations, school, or work.

* Keep track of all achievements and issues at work to use in interviews. Ex. when you got complimented by a patient to your boss, when you were stressed, when there was a conflict.

* Get published. Easy versions are your local pharmacy newsletter or a hospital newsletter. Honestly, all I had to do was ask and they were happy to get a student article. Or go further, reach out to an adviser or professor and ask if they will co-author something with you or help you get started.

* Take on extra projects. These are great talking points about initiative. Ask your boss or preceptor (or both!).

* Keep track of interesting cases with all of their information during rotations. You will want this for presentations.

* Go to Midyear and local conventions. Talk to everyone you can at the Residency showcase. Also, all those sites who have you fill out your email and name on a phone/tablet to ""record your attendance"" have a screen after that where the person you were talking to writes their impression of you. So make a good one! These come back around for interviews.

* Get involved in an organization and make sure it is meaningful.

* Make a spreadsheet of your potential candidates. Mine had: number of residents, average census, stipend, teaching certificate, deadline for application, if it had my preferred rotation (ICU or ER, yes/no), mandatory rotations, elective rotations, longitudinal work, staffing, holiday staffing, PGY2s, links to their websites, questions I had for that site (helpful in interviews), and answers to those questions. This kept everything in one spot.

**PhORCAS Opens**

* Personalize all letters of intent, but also have one ""general"" one that you can use if a new site pops up or for the Scramble.

* Fill in all of the profile information that seems optional with the stuff from your CV. The sites data mine your profile for the info instead of reading your CV in many cases.

* Get four letters of recommendation (the actual max), even though you can only submit three. This helps if someone falls through. I also got feedback during my interviews on who wrote good letters, so you could use that to your advantage if you have to scramble. Trade in one for another. One classmate had a letter writer copy and paste the wrong student's info, so she wished she had a fourth letter writer in case she had to Scramble (she didn't).

* Give your letter writers a list of what you like for each place, suggestions of your accomplishments, tentative ranking (preferred, middle, lowest), and your interests. I also attached ASHP's list of what sites look for and asked them to incorporate what they could. 

 * **13 Characteristics Sites Look For:** Writing Skills, Oral Communication Skills, Leadership/mentoring, Assertiveness, Ability to organize and manage time, Ability to work with peers and communicate effectively, Effective patient interactions, Dependability, Independence and resourcefulness, Willingness to accept constructive criticism, Emotional stability and maturity, Professionalism, Clinical Problem Solving Skills/
 * **General Guidelines from PhORCAS to Include:** How the candidate’s skills compares with peers, Strengths, Characteristics or observances.

* Put your Match Number on materials like your CV and email signature.

**Interviews**

* Look up interview questions and type up your answers in a document. Read them often. Adjust them as needed. I adjusted my short and long term goals after I realized in my first interview that they were weak. I also recorded them and listened to them on some of my long drives to interviews.

* Practice your basic knowledge and know they will typically throw the kinks at you for cases. For general questions, you get asked things like CURB65, target A1c, converting/starting insulin, target BP, Vanco troughs or AG kinetics, anticoag, afib, CHF, HTN, etc. For the cases, they threw in a lot of QTc prolongation, allergy to PCN, etc.

* Interview with all the sites you get offered for practice, as long as it is reasonable. I had to cancel my last interview because of physical exhaustion. Also, your mind will change! That's why it is good to accept interviews you were not as excited about. Ones I thought I would love, I didn't like much. Ones that were barely on my radar got ranked 1, 2, and 3 for me.

* Keep track of what you thought about them immediately. Rank them as you go. Save their materials. Write down the names of who you interviewed with. I honestly thought I would remember everything and keep them straight, but I couldn't. When you are evaluating them, the little things will be important. ""These two are pretty neck and neck, but I remember they didn't do med rec on their ER rotation so that's kind of nice that I wouldn't have to."" or ""These are neck and neck, but X had a gym and Y didn't have any parking for employees.""

* Bring questions, a LOT! More than you think. Personalize them for each site. Ask them questions to things you might have an idea of already. ""What does your ER rotation entail? Do you have autosubstitute policies?"" Ask the interviewers you rotate through at each site the same question if you want. It's good to get their different opinions and sometimes multiple people can attest to the same things. You will be surprised at how differently they may portray some things.

* Know your goals and why you chose their program. Why do you want to do residency? Pick out 2-3 aspects of their program to specifically mention to them.

* Ask what things they are expecting to expand that you could get involved in as a resident. This gives you a good idea of what you might have to do. Are they rolling out an ASP program? Are they not really expanding? Are they cracking down on med errors? 

* Bring your journal article write ups. I wish that was a joke, but I got called out twice for a journal article I did on rotation and was asked to talk about it. It is impressive when you can pull it out and talk it over with them. It happens a lot, like if you did an ID article and you happen to be interviewed by the ID pharmacist.

* Be able to talk about anything on your CV. 

* Have extra slides at the end of your presentation that anticipates questions to show that you thought ahead. Leave out some information on purpose that might prompt them to ask. Add in material that you did get asked from other interviews to the extra slides. Ex. Do a presentation on hyponatremia, but leave out information on ODS. So if they ask about how you calculated your rate, you can pull up that slide and show them.

* Don't ask about the food or hours you have to work. I thought that was obvious, but I saw multiple candidates do it that I interviewed with. Clarifying, don't ask this as if it is a huge deal. Bring up the food as a lighter talking point in the hallways. Certainly ask about the duties of staffing. I am thinking mostly of a situation where people asked about the hours and then talked about how they didn't want to work that much and when a guy was truly judging the cafeteria food as a consideration. Thanks to /u/Klebsiella_p for pointing out that it can be an okay thing! I should have clarified more.

* Send thank you emails after and add a personalized tidbit. ""I really enjoyed learning that you are rolling out ID, as that is what I'm interested in. That will be a great opportunity for your resident next year.""

**Questions I Was Asked:**

* What qualities do you possess that would make you a good resident?
* What are your worst qualities?
* What are your short-term and long-term goals? Board certification is a good answer for this.
* What three words would your best friend/you use to describe you?

Feel free to chime in suggestions and hope this is helpful!

Edit: check out r/PharmacyResidency

From /u/Klebsiella_p 

* My biggest piece of advice -Throughout your P4 rotations, write down any big interventions you had so that you can talk about them in your interviews. I was able to answer so many interview questions by giving them an example of an intervention I had made. *I agree so much with this! I was even asked this as a specific interview question.*

* In your interviews my primary goal was to make it as much like a conversation as possible, especially at the end of the interview.

* Write handwritten thank you notes if possible. Not many people do this and it is a lost art. It really makes you stand out and it is something that does not get lost in their 20+ emails a day. It also shows that you have good handwriting (if this is the case haha).

From /u/SmokeStackz 

* As an individual that interviews potential pharmacy residents, I cannot stress enough what an important thing being able to carry on a normal/fun conversation outside of our ""formal interview"" questions. We are people that are typically social and it helps if residents are also normal, fun, intelligent individuals. We have to spend a lot of time with you as preceptors, and it's SUCH a better experience when residents are friendly, kind, and easy to speak with.
If you are outgoing and friendly during your interview you make yourself a more memorable and likable candidate, and that means you might get picked over someone who has similar credentials that you do.

From /u/investigatorial 

* My biggest piece of advice is to set yourself up for as many networking opportunities as possible during your didactic years and especially during your APPE year. In other words, the right time to start thinking about a residency is somewhere between P1–P2. Residency programs get flooded with applications in December and January, and there are always many more candidates who look good on paper than there are interview slots. If you impress a faculty member or preceptor with your knowledge, work ethic, and attitude, you can leverage their connections to get you an interview at programs that may have otherwise passed you up as just another CV in the pile.

* Furthermore, it's critical that you treat every single rotation as a job interview because residency directors and other preceptors do talk to each other. If you find yourself on an APPE that you really don't enjoy, don't write it off as a location where you are no longer interested in applying for a residency and use that as an excuse to stop trying. Even if you don't apply there, the people with whom you work may very well be contacted by someone from a site to which you do apply asking about you.

* My other piece of advice, when you get to the interview, is to look out for programs that put on a show to cover up a malignant work culture. The easiest way to do this is to observe the current residents. Do they seem genuinely content or are they suppressing frustration by sticking to the script? Are their interactions with their RPD and preceptors friendly and meaningful or are they shallow and strained? When you're looking out for this stuff, try to remember that frustration and strained relationships are not always going to have overt outward signs. These people still have to be cordial enough to work with each other, after all. But imagine yourself in the position of one of those current residents. Before ranking a program highly, ask yourself if you would be happy in their shoes. Go with your gut.",15,56,2017-03-25,PHARMA,0.05150443439682325,0.9179326693216959,0.03056289752324422

Saturday, I got in to work and she was on our list again, for another trop. I kind of assumed she'd maybe had chest pain during the day, so we were checking her again. I drew the one, and someone else drew another one later.

Last night I got in and Mrs Smith was on the list for *another* trop. I went to her nurse and asked what sort of wacky heart condition was going on to need so many troponins, and was informed that Mrs Smith was there for a bladder problem, and her heart was fine.

Why all the labs?

Someone put in orders for this poor lady to get trops every six hours, forever, starting when she was in the ER. Ten freaking levels later (all negative), we can definitely say that her heart muscle is healthy. Not much else, though, because those are the only labs we've drawn since she left the ER.

Everyone screwed up here- I don't know what the doctor did, or why he put in such weird orders, or how nobody noticed she had no other results. The lab didn't notice we kept sending out results on the lady, because if everything is normal the results autoverify into the chart without any human intervention. Thanks to shift-work, nobody saw more than two trops at a time, and I guess just assumed things were normal. The nurses for some damn reason kept acknowledging the ten(?!) trop results without wondering why they kept getting them. Mrs Smith never said anything because she's a sweet old lady who still believes in The Doctors Know Best, so she just let it happen. I just, what even happened?

pharmacy,For anyone considering a residency in their future... I share with you my experience from reviewing candidate applications this year. It's getting more and more competitive each year...,"I was one of the three application screeners for our PGY1 program this year and wanted to share some demographic information that I found interesting for any students considering a residency in their future…  **The TL/DR moral of the story is, it’s very competitive out there… I was surprised at the quality of many of the applications we had to turn down… so if this is something you want, get started early!**

For some background, we are a 20+ year old residency program in a 500+ bed, independent academic medical center in a major urban market. We have 4 PGY1 positions.  Our screening rubric included an assessment of: *previous work experience, organizational involvement/leadership, colleague opinion, letters of intent, research activities, letters of recommendation, GPA, community service, and number of ""clinical"" rotations*. Twice the weight was given to the first 4 categories. ""Other scholarly activities"" (competitive internships, publications, etc.) did not have an official spot on the rubric this year, but should have, and helped with some close calls. 

We received 65 full applications for our 4 positions. All applications were scored based on a rubric of the aforementioned characteristics. The vital statistics of all applicants are as follows:

* **Work experience**: Over half of applicants had hospital work experience, with close to the other half having some other work experience (usually retail).  Only 3 candidates had no work experience.
* **Organizational involvement/Leadership**: Over half of applicants held a leadership position in a pharm organization, and all other candidates were at least members of one.
* **Colleague opinion**: one-third of applicants had a colleague (current or past employee) weigh in on them (some unofficially). Their final score was adjusted based on whether or not a colleague weighed in, so as to not hurt candidates that did not know anyone. However, in the few cases where a colleague gave a negative opinion, their score was negatively affected.
* **Letters of intent**: Two-thirds were “very site specific” and mentioned specific experiences we offer, or mentioned meeting a specific person at a showcase, etc. Fortunately, none were absolutely ridiculous.
* **Research activities**: 61% of applicants had a research project presented at a conference. Around 30% had no research or DUE activities.
* **Letters of Recommendation**: We require 3 letters through Phorcas. Surprisingly, only 64% of candidates had letters with all three writers stating that they “highly recommend” the candidate. The remaining 36% had at least one recommendation with “recommend”.  There was 1 or 2 with “recommend with reservations”.
* **GPA**: The mean GPA for all candidates was 3.56 +/- 0.27.  The lowest GPA was 2.8 and the highest was 3.98.
* **Community service**: Only 15% had recent activities (in past 12 months), while 62% had some history of community service. One-quarter of applicants had no community service documented on their application materials.

pharmacy,Alprazolam going Schedule II in Alabama?,"My pharmacy got an email message from Susan Alverson, executive secretary of the Alabama Board of Pharmacy, yesterday, telling us that Alabama legislators are making alprazolam a Schedule II substance. Has anybody else heard about this? I saw an article online from January that such a change was being considered but I can't find anything that says that it *will* be changed.

Below is the body of the aforementioned message:

&gt; Xanax to CII

&gt; Dear Pharmacist,

&gt; On Wednesday, March 15th, the Alabama Department of Public Health (ALDPH) made the decision to move Xanax to a DEA schedule CII. Also to move Ambien to a CIII and all benzodiazepines to a CIII. The Alabama Department of Health (ADPH) regulates scheduling of controlled drugs according to Alabama Code, Title 20, Chapter 2. This change was proposed by the Board of Medical Examiners and an ADPH committee voted unanimously to approve it.

&gt; The committee was composed 100% of physicians appointed by the Medical Association of Alabama. Pharmacy was not notified of the proposal or the meeting during which public comment was accepted. The Pharmacy Board did submit extensive comments to the ADPH Committee and to the Director of ADPH, but they did not affect the decision.

&gt; A petition for a legislative committee hearing has been filed to have this reversed. If we can convince more than 50% of the members to reject this new rule, it will be changed or not go into effect.

&gt; WE NEED YOUR HELP. Obviously, decision makers thought they could ignore us, and we could and would do nothing. State Associations and the Board are working, but that is not enough. The same few faces don't mean much. WE NEED NUMBERS!!! Place a call, leave a message, send a note or an email. You will feel good when you do. How long will we let policies about pharmacy be made by everyone but pharmacists? Please tell your prescribers too; they are likely not aware of the change.

&gt; I have attached a list of names, addresses and phone numbers of the legislators on the committee. There is also a list of talking points attached. Send us more ideas if you have them.

&gt; Thank you,

&gt; Susan Alverson, R.Ph.

medicine,Specialties best suited for overseas aid work?,"Hi!
I'm a medical student in Australia coming close to the end of my degree and have been starting to think more about what specialty I want to pursue.
At the moment I am still quite undecided what I want to do; all specialties seem interesting at first glance but many seem mundane and repetitive rather quickly. Of the rotations I have had thus far, I liked OBGYN the most as I really liked the variety.

The whole reason I studied medicine was because I am really interested in global health and plan to spend most of my career doing aid work.
I have tried doing some research and am aware that companies like MSF value specialties like; emergency medicine, trauma surgery, anaesthetics, OBGYN, paeds etc
I was wondering if anyone knows of any other specialties which may be of great value for foreign aid? Physician or surgical specialties? (Like operation smile which does cleft palate and lip repairs)
I am not too concerned about pay/lifestyle of whatever speciality I do one day chose; mostly just areas that interest me that I know I can use overseas.

medicine,Doctors of Meddit: What are your thoughts on the new(ish) quality payment program?,"I'm not very up to speed on healthcare politics and I just today learned about the quality payment program (QPP) that went into effect just this year. My basic understanding is as follows:

- You are required to participate in the QPP if you see a certain threshold of Medicare patients (&gt;100 patients or bill &gt; $30,000 yearly to Medicare), or face reimbursement cuts if you are eligible and choose not to participate.

- The program has two ""arms"" -  the merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS) or alternative payment model (APM) arm, with the majority of physicians falling in the MIPS arm. 

- The MIPS arm follows the usual fee-for-service model of medicare reimbursement, with a positive or negative % modifier starting at +/- 4% and eventually working up to +/- 9% by 2020, based on various self reported metrics (quality, cost, improvement activities, and advancing care information)

- I actually don't really understand what 'alternative payment models' entail, other than its definition is: 

&gt;""APMs are defined by CMS as payment approaches developed in partnership with the
clinician community that provide incentives to clinicians to provide high-quality and costefficient
care""

Whatever that means?

In addition to hearing general thoughts on the QPP, some specific questions I had are: 

- Do physicians here see this as a step in the right direction, or is it more bureaucratic  BS that would ultimately turn physicians off from seeing Medicare patients? 

- With private insurers most likely following suit, it seems that this will become the future regardless of whether or not you accept medicare patients. In that case, will this actually help to improve reimbursement from the current volume based fee-for-service towards a true ""value based"" payment system?

- How will this impact procedural specialties vs non-procedural specialties? I've seen quite the mix of both here on meddit so I'm hoping they can weigh in.

- Is this likely to significantly alter referral patterns for Medicare patients?
