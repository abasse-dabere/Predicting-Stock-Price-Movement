Health,Tinnitus sufferers: How do you percieve the ringing in your ears?,"For the uninitiated: Tinnitus is the condition where a person experiences constant noise even though there are no external sounds. ""Phantom sound"", as it were.

I just became curious how other people percieve this, since I've lately been more aware of the ringing in my ears than I usually am. I have some level of musical background, so identifying noises is second nature to me. A few weeks ago I became aware of a constant ringing in my left ear, which I haven't noticed before. I've had a ringing noise in my right ear for almost 10 years now, and I'm pretty sure that it was caused by an accident where I hit my ear really hard with the palm of my hand. It was the loudest noise I've ever heard. I had a similar thing happen with my left ear about 5 years ago, but didn't notice anything then.

These things don't bother me a lot, but they're always there when it's quitet. Tonight, I measured some of them by listening - my right ear rings at about 1750Hz, my left ear at about 680Hz. In addition, there's an array of constant high-frequency tones (above 10000Hz, but I think I hear different frequencies whenever I focus) that have been there as long as I can remember. These sometimes get louder when I exercise, the others do not. I have the impression that these high-frequency tones got louder after a rave I was at, but I am not sure. I _always_ wear earplugs at band rehersal and concerts, since I'm a bit paranoid about my ears (as you might have noticed :P)

However, given the recent new noise, I decided to test my hearing threshold...using just the speakers in my room and a normal listening volume, I'm able to hear at least 18000Hz. I'm 25 years old, so this doesn't seem to indicate any significant hearing loss.

Is this something I should see a doctor about? What experiences do the rest of you have with ringing in the ears? Significantly, are there any of you who do _not_ experience something like this? Intuition tells me that this is something everyone experiences to one degree or another, but that's just an uninformed guess.",22,27,2012-03-10,PHARMA,0.13038651645183563,0.8471320867538452,0.022481407970190048

Health,Someone knows sth. about strange spasms before falling asleep,"I'm not sure if its a problem at all but once every two or three months I really have problems falling asleep. These problems start with a strange pressure in my head leading to uncontrollable spasms of my entire body. My arms start flinging around, all of my muscles starts to flex. Those attacks have a duration for 20min to half an hour. Afterwards I have the most vivid dreams, which i can remember days afterwards. 

I went to a neurologist twice, because it bothers me for nearly 3 years now. All he found was a unusual peak in my delta waves, which disappeared at the second visit. 

Anyone have the slightest clue what it could relate to?  Do i have to worry? ( I definitely would if the frequency of it would rise but once every two or three months just makes me curious.)

IMPORTANT: Those spasms are not related to those muscle relaxation dreams, were you suddenly wake up after sleeping away cause your legs to kick. I'm fully conscious when it is happening and its kind of awkward 'cause i can't gain control of it.

Health,Tis the season for allergies... any advice?,"Wasn't sure where to go to ask this type of thing, if there is a more appropriate place for this, please let me know!

I have pretty awful Spring allergies.  Mostly allergic to Oak pollen and to a lesser degree a few other types of pollen.  I took allergy shots for over 5 years and all that did was cause them to morph from unbearably itchy eyes and some itchy skin rash type things in the crease of my elbows and behind my knees to really awful sinus congestion (which actually is almost heaven compared to the itchy eyes) and my face breaking out in this ugly rash that dries up, gets itchy and starts peeling.  So I eventually gave up on allergy shots.

Zyrtec-D is the only thing that can even come close to keep my sinuses under control.  But really, the sinuses aren't really much of an issue for me.  It's my face.  I've been to several different doctors and all they do is give me some sort of steroid shot or cream which does nothing for me.  A doctor a couple of years ago gave me this ""Desonide"" cream that actually seemed to work.  It would make the itching go away and the bumps go away to some extent too.  So next Spring comes around and I get some more, I put it on and HOLY CRAP the burning.  I had to wash it off immediately, the burning was unbearable.  Since then, the only thing I've found that helps at all is just avoiding the outdoors at all costs.  I carry a pack of unscented baby wipes with me and wipe off my face and hands every time I come in from outside.  And as soon as I get home, I change into at least a shirt that has not been outside.  My eyelids break out too.  I wake up in the mornings, sometimes hardly even being able to open my eyes because they are so swollen.

I could take a picture to show you, but I'm not sure you'd even be able to tell at this point.  Until it starts getting really irritated and starts drying out, it just looks like my forehead, nose, chin, and ears have this rough bumpy looking texture and it's maybe slightly more pinkish than normal in that area.

So my question is, is there anything else I can do or ask a doctor for that might help?  I'm looking for something besides simply avoiding the outdoors for an entire month.  It's hard enough to do that being on a college campus.  But I am going to Paris for the month of April for a study abroad program and being outdoors will be simply unavoidable there.  I'd like to be able to enjoy Spring time (and my trip) without having my face look and feel like some miserable diseased mess.",11,5,2012-03-11,PHARMA,0.12358623743057251,0.8476850390434265,0.02872869186103344

Health,Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a really frustrating illness to have. No quick fixes - but I want to share how I got over it myself.,"Hey, r/health. IBS is something the medical establishment doesn't really know how to deal with, most of the time. Isolating triggers is usually the way to go about it - but this mostly manages it and doesn't solve it. I have reduced my IBS, which is something I never thought I'd do. I used to have fatigue, chronic abdominal pain, bloating, terrible inability to control my bowels (mostly constipation), and I just felt really demoralised, because every time I ate I would feel shitty (literally - bad pun) and sluggish afterwards. 

So here's what I did. I'll give a little reason for each thing. 

ANXIETY - a lot of people think IBS is just anxiety, which can be a frustrating thing to hear. If anything, it can make existing anxiety worse! But managing anxiety is important, and the way I went about this was getting my life in order and through massive amounts of exercise. Trying to organise, stop unnecessary stress. Counselling and medication, if needs be. For supplements, magnesium (muscle relaxant) and St John's Wort have helped me heaps already. Also valerian is an indispensable herbal sleep remedy and has turned me from an insomniac into a relatively easy sleeper.

PHYSICAL HEALTH - yoga, chiropractic work, strength. I'm convinced that getting these things in order (I have been very unfit in the past) helped relax my body and prevent my nervous system from going into overload. I do believe there have been some studies down about the spine and how important central nervous system alignment is for the bowel. Lots of cardio, where you sweat considerably. It'll build up your endurance, too! To pain, discomfort, lots of things. 

DIET (this is a big one) - three major things:

1. Figuring out what I'm allergic to. I was already kind of suspicious about obvious things like gluten, but I did a biochemistry test and it turned out I couldn't eat all sorts of weird things. Eggs, capsicums, cabbage. Finding this out and eliminating these foods has helped me get rid of the really spiky abdominal pain, though I still had issues with soreness and bloating.

2. Paleo. I have been following a strict paleo diet and this has possibly been the biggest help to me. Why does it work? I believe, personally, processing modern foods for an already compromised digestive system is too hard. Stuff like grains and starches feed yeasts in the bowel that can compromise the good bacteria in it, and also they are simple carbohydrates that arguably humans weren't designed to eat in such large amounts. People may disagree, but the results for me have been argument enough. PALEO INVOVLES:

- eliminating: all grains (rice, wheat, spelt, buckwheat, quinoa, anything that is made into bread or pasta basically), starches (potatoes, tapioca etc - sweet potato is okay, however), legumes (soy [I still eat soy sauce however, because I only have it in small amounts and otherwise I would never, ever be able to eat Asian food], peanuts, beans, lentils), dairy (everything that contains high amounts of lactose, but yes, even yoghurt [however I permit SOME butter]), sugar (sweeteners, cane sugar [agave and honey are okay])

what does this leave? - meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, honey, tea and coffee. alcohol is not advised, but it's okay. In the end, these are delicious, under-utilised foods! Finding paleo recipes has been fun and surprisingly satisfying, and what's great in the end, is that you're eating delicious things that are good for you! No guilt, just honest-to-goodness great food. I've recently found recipes for paleo biscuits, bread and fried chicken. Of course it's going to require personal organisation and makes eating out a bit of a headache, but it is satisfying (and it stops you from frittering away your money on shitty fast food!)

3. Food combining. It's difficult for the body to digest proteins and carbohydrates (like fruit) at the same time because the former process is very slow, the latter is very fast. Trying to avoid combining them helps. Also, somewhat weirdly, not drinking with food helps! Water can dilute stomach acids and make a weak digestive system even weaker.

PILLS - there are two, both very important:

1. Pro-biotic. I'm not entirely convinced that our heavy reliance on anti-biotics (and often not following the full course, or prescribing them too readily) hasn't caused severe problems in bacterial flora health in the gut. Basically these little bacteria are the things that break down your food for you. Without them, your digestion suffers. So pro-biotics try to restore them! Try to get a powerful pro-biotic pill with at least 4-5 strains of bacteria (yakult and the like is delicious, but not powerful enough!) YOU MUST TAKE ONE EVERY DAY, with meals. Also diet is very important. Paleo gives good conditions in the bowel, because the bacteria aren't competing with the sugary, starchy, yeasty conditions of a bowel on a regular diet. 

2. Digestive enzymes - I cannot get behind these enough! These are amazing. These gave my IBS the last kick in the teeth, and I feel confident enough to eat now without worrying about symptoms. These basically help you break down your food. They're easy to take. You simply take them with meals. Over a few days, you should notice a dramatic improvement in bloating. Even without the other things, give these a go!

ANTI-DEPRESSANTS - through a gastroenterologist I was prescribed a mild anti-depressant that has been shown to alleviate basic PTSD. This was designed to re-program my body and stop the stress response that occurred whenever I ate. Some decent research is behind this, but going off it I found more improvement with the other things. But it's something to think about. 

So, there you go. I did all these things together. Suddenly, I have energy again, can get out of bed in the morning, and don't feel horrible about the day ahead of me because I'm so anxious about my symptoms. As a six-year sufferer, this has been incredible. I know it's a big investment for a lot of people, but ultimately all of these things are agitating towards a healthier life overall, and even better one without pain. I still don't think a lot of gastroenterologists are looking at the body holistically, or linking the bowel to other body processes that might be going wrong. Did you know that your bowel has more nerve endings than anywhere else in your body? That's a lot that can go wrong. So it's important to have an open mind.

Also, don't be afraid to get these things checked out. I put off being tested and seeking medical help (though it didn't help much, it started me on a quest to find answers, which has been wonderful) for 6 years. And in the end, talking about it and getting a conoloscopy wasn't too bad. Also, if you have more serious conditions it allows you to know definitively. Also for instance, if you have coeliac disease! Eliminating gluten is a very easy way to eliminate symptoms in such a case. So actually, you can get better results. It's important to pursue symptoms if you have them.

To wrap up (this has been a very long post), all of this together has helped me. It's total, but I feel better than I ever have. And I have been so frustrated by conventional medicine's inability to help me that I had to do it myself. I'm sick of the misinformation, and want to see other people getting over this upsetting and difficult illness.

If you have any questions, I'm very happy to talk in a PM! (:

I try not to take it very often, stick more to ibuprofen or aspirin. Problem is this: I get migraines/severe headaches pretty commonly. At least one a week. Excedrin (acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine) is the only thing that really knocks out a bad headache for me. 

The bottle says don't have more than 3 drinks if you've had any acetaminophen, but honestly that sounds like way too much. My rule has always been if I've had one, I can't have the other. I'm not a heavy drinker or anything, but I do like a couple beers a week. I'm talking less than a six pack a week. Usually around 3 a week spread over the weekend. 

One day I had had a beer, and a while later that night I got a severe headache. I HAD to take some excedrin or I would be out for the entire night. I felt sick and just generally not good in the stomach area but my head did improve. 

So what's the actual prevailing medical opinion on acetaminophen and alcohol mix? How much is safe to mix, if any? How much time should you have between each?

Health,Haven't brushed my teeth in two years.,"Hello Reddit,

This is a throwaway account as I'm incredibly embarrassed by this. Basically, through a series of depression, lack of self worth, and laziness, I haven't brushed my teeth in two years. I'm starting to feel the effects. A few teeth hurt often now, and at first I thought it was my wisdom teeth coming in more, but I'm not so sure anymore. Also, on two of the teeth on the side of my mouth a little bit of the tooth...casing I guess? has chipped off. I know the harm I am doing myself and I have tried to brush them again but now I guess since it's been so long it hurts to brush them. What can I do to make it easier for me to transition back into healthy oral hygiene? I would love to go to a dentist but I honestly think I'm too embarrassed to do that right now, even though I know it would be the best thing. Maybe if I can get back to brushing and flossing regularly I will feel confident enough to seek out a dentist.",91,100,2012-03-21,PHARMA,0.07583501189947128,0.832088828086853,0.09207610785961151

medicine,"[r/confession] Guys, I have a REALLY bad resident. Can you help me turn him around?","'Sup, meddit. 

I don't normally post with this account, but I'm a rookie attending and I've got until Monday (he's taking Step 3 now, and has the rest of the week off) to formulate a plan to get a nice, personable guy that's straight-up ""on the bubble"", and on *probation* as of now onto the right track. I've given him 2 weeks ""off"" so he can study and not given him shit so far. If y'all wouldn't mind hearing me out, I'd appreciate the perspective.

I think the problems are twofold and the first is easier:

1. He's completely ""gun shy"" now. I feel like the attention and probation has created a mental block. When pimped (by others) he shuts down and starts saying ""I don't know"" to things like ""Why was this patient admitted?"" even though I know damn well he knows why. He's lost confidence and just goes deer-in-the-headlights to pressure. He gives up easily now. I need to be non-threatening and nonjudgmental. I'm going to have to get inside to make change by being much more Jiminey Cricket/Tinkerbell than Mike DeBakey/Red Foreman.

2. This guy is missing basic, *fundamental* skills and ideas about patient ownership and what it means to be a doctor. I know almost nothing about his intern year, but I can tell he was just treated as a bad prelim, and idly passed along until he left, and I'm frankly pissed that this has gone on for over half a year more. He seems lazy, but I think that's just because he has no sense of ""this is YOUR job"" and ""YOU are in charge of this item"". He feels like a 4th year post-match med student that's still kind of ""checked out"" instead of someone sliding toward their 3rd year of residency. He forgets basic things like lab orders and consults even when I remind him, and when he does call a consult he seems to have fabricated no picture of where we're going with the patient, *why* we're calling this consult, what we want to know, and what we need the consulting physicians to know so they can help us. **He is somewhat disengaged, and seems to be constantly waiting for orders or criticism instead of using his brain to solve his patient's problems and propose new ideas to me.**

He's not the brightest med student, fine. Neither was I. But he's made it this far and I know he can't be stupid. It's just that no one has taught him the gravity of his job. He's not been advanced to the level of a second-year in terms of actively pursuing solutions, and taking ownership as if he were a physician working without someone turning the pages of his coloring books for him.

That last comment was snide, and I don't think of him as a drooling idiot, mainly because if I did I'd just bide my time with him, do all the work, and let him get kicked from the program. I'm too fresh for this to be ""not my problem"". My timestamp of experience is going on his brain, and he is given to me as a resident, so that means he should get more from me than I get from him. He does my busy work, and I take the time to give him my all and make him a better doctor the best way I know how.

Share experiences, please. I was just like he is, but as a starting 3rd year med student, and I can't for the life of me remember what turned me around. At any rate I don't think what transitioned me into ""physician"" back then will work this late in the game for him.

**TL;DR: Bad resident. Doesn't get it. Gun shy from criticism and that's making him worse. Fundamentally lacking, but not fundamentally hopeless, and not fundamentally a bad guy. SRSLY read the whole thing please.**

Appreciate the consideration. Thanks.

**EDIT: I have an idea!** So, most of our patients are new to him, and ALL of the treatment plans have been going 10 days without him. This means he's not gonna know anyone. So, this first week, *he* is the attending and *I* am the resident. Check it: His problem is not knowing what questions to ask to formulate a linear and multidisciplinary plan. *He* is now in charge of asking *me* the right questions and getting the pertinent data from me. Nothing is off limits. The rules are simple:

1. You must first check the copy-pasted assessment and plan and ALL of the relevant notes to see if you can figure out why we're doing/not doing something. He must find the deficiencies and things left undone. He gets to pimp me about why I'm calling/not calling certain consults. They are now his patients, and I work for him (in a sense) but that sets up number 2....

2. Nothing is off limits. The only stupid question is the one he didn't ask that fucks something up. No judgement, no intimidation. If he suggests an alternative I must entertain it and we discuss. 

Obviously, he's going to be doing all the work of notes, consults, and orders. This will put him in a vacuum of direct cause-effect of his patients for the first time. I'm just here for support and guidance!

Moved interstate with the gf to start a new job fresh out of university.  Never lived out of home before, never worked full time as I went straight from school to university study to this.  Lots of big moves.

Basically, everything is fucked.  We're both vegetarian, her for a long time, me since the move.  I'm feeling tired all of the time and have a constant feeling of anxiety.  Serious anxiety.  When I'm in the office I'm not too bad but when I'm at home, especially when I'm in bed trying to sleep, I've had full blown panic attacks.  About nothing.  

Our sex life has suffered immensely and I don't know what to do about it.  I have basically no interest in sex anymore.  Not with anyone.  The longer it goes on for the more stressed and anxious I get.  The things I'm normally interested in no longer hold any real interest for me anymore.  Work isn't totally what I was expecting but it's interesting enough I guess.

Health,Sick for years. Got blood tested for food alleriges. Allergic to... almost everything. Help?,"So I've had eczema and allergy issues my whole life. In the last 5 years they have just gotten more and more severe, to the point where my itchiness and angry skin dominates my every waking thought.

I figured it could be food allergies so I got a blood food-allergy test.

I got the results back recently and am kind of floored. The doctor said she's never seen anything this bad. I'm ""moderate to highly"" allergic to almost everything I was tested for.

I've been following a very strict paleo diet for years in an effort to fix myself. Turns out I'm allergic to things like....

* coconut oil (I cook everything in it)

* apples and bananas (my morning snack)

* broccoli and spinach (goodbye greens)

* casein and cow milk (didn't eat dairy anyways)

* chicken and eggs (my main staples)

* sweet and regular potatos (my main source of carbs)

* rice (other carb source)

* chocolate (am i being punished?!)

* avacados ( =(  )

* yeast, gluten, wheat (goodbye beer. haven't had bread/gluten in years)

* pepper (SERIOUSLY I'M ALLERGIC TO PEPPER?!)

And more.... (cucumbers, carrots, almonds, asparagus, barley, cinnamon, corn, flaxseed, mushroom, orange, sesame seed, etc etc etc the list goes on)


So now I'm eating unseasoned steak and bacon with some cooked kale, everyday, repeatedly. Still having a lot of problems, constantly itchy, constantly feel like crap, but I haven't given it enough time to see if maybe this makes it better.


My questions:

Has anyone experience extreme food allergies like this?

How accurate is a blood food-allergy test? Is there any chance for false positives? Am I seriously allergic to carrots and cucumbers?

What the hell can I eat??

The doctors have never seen anything like it and are referring me to an immunologist. **But my BLOOD is allergic to these things, can you even change the immune response of your blood???**

Please reddit, I am miserable and it looks like that's not going to change. I'm reaching out to you for help, support, suggestions, *anything*.

I'm 23 male and in great shape otherwise.

medicine,"Does this exist: a research project where thousands of people document their lifestyle, products they use, food they eat, places they live and work at - in order to gather a database where patterns can be detected later for illnesses, causes and effects?","I'm thinking along the lines of: 
Thousands of people logging everything they do that could affect their health: Detailed family tree &amp; DNA sample. Have 9-5 office job (daily commute 20 miles), live in a city (pop. 50.000) in Sweden, eat home made wheat bread PB&amp;J sandwich for lunch 4 times a week, use Axe deodorant 5 times a week, eat home made dinner 6 times a week, only eat breakfast once a week (toast, eggs &amp; OJ). 10 hrs TV/week. This much beer, that much wine, cookies, snacks, wearing sunglasses, using sunblock in the summer, vacation to France.

Something like that, but with every detail included as much as technically possible.

I had this idea a couple days ago and figured I'd post it for you guys to read. I suspect that most research is either done after symptoms or illnesses form a noticeable pattern, or they are so acute that researchers start looking for patterns. For diseases that are slowly becoming more common (MS, Alzheimer's, various types of cancer?) and surf under the radar for too long, it may be much harder to get funding for and take much longer for researchers to even begin looking, let alone detect any patterns. The delay between cause and effect could be too long. 

A project like described above may help find that kind of patterns. So my question is, does this exist? Or is there a good reason why this isn't being done?

medicine,"to the doctor-doctor families out there, how did you do it?","Hi everyone. Thanks in advance for reading. So my situation is this: my girlfriend and I are both medical students in a long distance relationship (~2 hour flight). We're both at the end of 2nd year, and while I'm preparing for 3rd year, she's about to enter the PhD portion of an MD/PhD. Right now, the plan is for me to match to where she is (a major city), upon which we'd hopefully be able to start a family (I know this isn't a given, and we have contingency plans, but let's assume it happens for now).

My question is, when would be the best time to have children in this situation? As soon as we're together, I'll be a (probable) surgical intern working my tail off, and she'll be doing her PhD. Even if her schedule is a little more flexible than mine, I'm not really sure where the time sacrifices are going to come from. And things will be even more stressful once she re-enters the MD curriculum, followed by her own residency. Would it be better to hold off on kids until our residencies are farther along and we might both have a little time? If I learned anything in med school about this, 35 is kind of the upper limit for women in terms of childbearing. We've dated for 6 years now, and at this point the only reservation we have is how this whole raising-a-family-while-both-crazily-busy thing is going to work out.

Health,My sprained ankle and The state of the american health system,"Two weeks ago I was skateboarding and destroyed my ankle (the side of my foot touched my shin).  I waited a night and tried to sleep it off but the pain in the morning was just as bad and my kankle hadn't come down in swelling at all, so I decided I should go to the hospital as I'm a student not in my home state and have no primary physicians here.  

I arrived at the emergency room at around 7:30 am and only waited about 30 minutes before seeing someone to check my vitals.

After having my vitals checked (everything was fine) I then proceeded to the emergency rooms main hall where they have all sorts of folks in rooms and on beds.  I sat on a bed right in front of the main desk for about an hour before I went in to get x rays.

The x rays came back and i was told i had not fractured anything, it was just a severe sprain and I was told to sit tight while they got m crutches. 

Three hours later a man arrived with crutches and a cloth ankle brace and instructed me on how to use crutches and how to tie on my brace.

The cost of this nearly 5 hour ankle excursion:
$1038.58

Here's a break down

Pharmacy (1 ibuprofen generic) $1.00

Medical/surgical supplies and devices (crutches and brace) $31.58

radiology - diagnostic $171.00

emergency services $649.00

Cast services $186.00

I am someone who has full double coverage for health insurance from my folks.  My question is how the fuck can anyone without insurance afford even a goddamn ankle sprain?  I only damaged my tendons without any fracturing but how is someone to be sure without seeing a doctor or going to the hospital?  It makes my stomach turn to think that someone without insurance cant even see someone for something as menial as an ankle sprain without having to take out a loan.",19,12,2012-03-30,PHARMA,0.08713216334581375,0.8862825036048889,0.026585353538393974
