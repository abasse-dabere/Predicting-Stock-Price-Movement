medicine,"Surgeons of reddit: what precisely could be meant by ""meatball surgery""?","This is an academic question from popular culture:

In the television show `M*A*S*H`, surgeons were forced to perform ""meatball surgery"". I suspect this is a term that the writers picked up when discussing how surgeons performed with wounded coming from the frontlines, given the limited supplies/personnel. 

http://mash.wikia.com/wiki/Meatball_Surgery

In the abstract, this makes sense. But what precisely does this refer to? What sort of procedure would these doctors perform in quick/dirty fashion as opposed to using the proper technique? 

If any surgeons of reddit can envisage a concrete example, I'd be very interested. Thanks for the help/discussion",771,1288,2017-06-01,PHARMA,0.048197414726018906,0.9114710688591003,0.04033154621720314

pharmacy,Your pet peeves?,"I have quite a few myself, but am wondering what grinds the gears of the denizens on here. For me, in no particular order, my pet peeves are:

1. Customers that insist we contact their doctor / insurance company during rushes (I do not mind doing this when it is quiet, but at 4:00 on a Monday? Come on...take some responsibility.)

2. Drivethru customers that want to wait in their spot while we do a rebill or a refill...to be fair they are always reasonable about this when we are swamped, but during times of light to moderate activity, some think their Xanax refills need to be rushed.

3. Drivethru customers more interested in their phone conversations than acknowledging the technician or pharmacist.

4. Synthroid bottles.

5. People at the consultation window that ask questions like ""where can find distilled water?""

6. People on the phone that demand to speak to the pharmacist for not-so medically necessary consultations...""Can I get my Lisinopril refilled?"" ""What time do you guys close?""

medicine,I am a layperson who attempted a simple explanation of cancer in a major subreddit. Was I accurate or am I spreading misinformation?,"A thread was posted discussing a 111 year old war vet who drinks and smokes and has done so his whole life. Someone stated he should be studied for possible cure for cancer, which I refuted with his anecdote:

&gt;Cancer is a lottery. Smoking is buying 50 tickets a week instead of one a week. 

&gt;Some people only buy one ticket ever and hit the jackpot (young children with cancer). Others buy as many tickets as they can their entire life and never hit.

&gt;When we look at the numbers across the entire population, the relationship is clear. But you, as an individual, can ""do everything right"" and still get cancer - while the guy who works in a factory, smokes, sunbathes without sunscreen never has cancer.   

Someone then replied this:

&gt;Is cancer actually a lottery, or we just don't understand the mechanisms behind it, so it seems random to us? Perhaps who will have cancer and who won't is a totally deterministic process that we don't understand yet, so studying these people's DNA might be worth it.  

To which I replied with this more detailed explanation:

&gt;The general mechanisms behind cancer are well understood. DNA in a cell mutates in such a way that the cell begins reproducing uncontrollably, and it escapes detection by the body. In particular, there are mechanisms inside the cell to protect this (the cell will either repair the DNA or kill itself), and mechanisms outside the cell like the immune system. This is why there's no ""cure for cancer"", different mutations to different cells in the body manifest very differently. A rogue cell in the breast (breast cancer) has very different properties from a rogue cell in the prostate (prostate cancer).
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, 99.9999999% of the time, the mechanisms above work fine. There are mutations that *could* cause cancer on an almost daily basis. Yet, typically, they're properly dealt with. The cell fixing the DNA damage is the most common. But the cell dying or being killed by the immune system are also typically effective. Sometimes, though, none of the systems work. The cell survives. It begins reproducing as fast as possible. Now you've got cancer.
&gt;
&gt;Anything that can mutate DNA increases your risk for cancer. Radiation. Certain chemicals. Having more cells for mutations to occur in (positive correlation between obesity and some cancers). Smoking is a big factor. Numerous chemicals in burning cigarettes are known carcinogens. That's why I made the lottery example. By exposing yourself to these factors you greatly increase the chance of a DNA mutation that leads to cancer. But, it doesn't guarantee anything. It's a statistics game. 

Was I reasonably accurate? Or am I just another person who doesn't realize how little they know? I'd like to know four my own edification, but also so I can edit my posts if necessary. Thanks!",70,233,2017-06-04,PHARMA,0.04758333042263985,0.9240778684616089,0.02833878993988037

pharmacy,How many times can you transfer a CIII-CV Prescription if both pharmacies share an electronic online database?,"I still can't for the life of me figure out what is correct. Hope someone can help me out!

**FEDERAL LAW states:
""Original prescription information for a Schedule III, IV, or V controlled substance may be transferred on a on-time basis only for the purpose of refill dispensing.**

**Pharmacies electronically sharing a real-time online database may transfer up to the maximum refills permitted by law and the prescriber's authorization.""**

What exactly does this mean? Does that mean if I work at AAA and WM wants a transfer of a control I can only give them ONE refill and rest is void? Or is it I can only transfer all the refills just one time?

If I transfer from AAA to AAA, does that mean I can transfer multiple times because we share the same electronic system? Or does that mean I can still only transfer it once but can give them all the refills that are remaining?

Massachusetts law then states, **""Prescriptions authorizing refills for CIII-CV may be transferred between pharmacies on a one-time only basis EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY LAW.** 

Does that mean pharmacies sharing an electronic system are allowed to transfer CIII-CV Rx's multiple times?

medicine,Looking for insight on an intubation gone awry.,"Hey all, I'm a paramedic working in a hospital based system in a busy urban area. Recently I had a case involving a middle aged male who had overdosed on Gabapentin (possibly upwards of 162g). What followed were some of the most intense moments of my career and I am hoping to get some feedback on what may have gone wrong.

The patient was found unresponsive, with irregular respirations, rapid and regular pulses ~100bpm, his skin was warm and diaphoretic. We also observed erratic muscle spasms that I would describe as myoclonic. His pupils are equal and reactive at ~4mm. There were no signs of other drug or ETOH use, and no signs of trauma. Vital signs were stable (160/90, 94% on high flow O2), but there was difficulty in assisting the patients irregular and ineffective ventilations with basic airway management so the decision was made to secure his airway. We administered 150mcg Fentanyl IVP,  20mg Etomidate IVP, and 150mg Succinylcholine IVP. The patient appeared well sedated, experienced fasciculations, and was intubated without difficulty. 

Shortly after confirming placement and securing the ETT, roughly 2 minutes post intubation. The patient was awake and attempting to extubate himself, which was the only purposeful movement observed during our entire contact. We administered an additional 100mcg of Fentanyl and 2.5mg of Midazolam with a very short and not very effective period of sedation afterward ~5 minutes.

Our medical control physician gave orders for additional Fentanyl and Midazolam as long as the patient did not become hypotensive, which he did not. All in all the patient was given a total of 450mcg of Fentanyl and 5mg of Midazolam and at no point was he well sedated. The patients SpO2 got as low as 88% while agitated and periods of bigeminal PVC's were observed on the ECG. Upon arrival at the ED the patient was started on Diprivan at 45mcg/kg/min which was also ineffective, the patient was eventually admitted to the ICU, intubated, although I'm currently not sure what was used to stabilize him. 

While I wait for a follow up from toxicology I'm hoping to hear if anyone can give some insight on what may have lead to this patients reaction to not only the opiates and benzodiazepines, but also the succinylcholine.

medicine,Women who are doctors: What are your experiences with sexism in the workplace and medical school? Does it ever get better?,"I'm a woman and I'm applying to medical school right now. Every person I meet who asks me what I studied in undergrad or what I do currently cannot seem to grasp that I am going to be a doctor. Every single time I tell someone I was pre-med and I'm applying to med school, the response is always some variation of ""oh, to be a nurse right?"" ""oh, so you mean you're going to nursing school."" It makes me so mad!! If I was going to nursing school I would've said nursing school, not medical school. I feel like they're correcting me. This happens in bars, in ubers, at the hair salon, at work (pretty much every small talk interaction). And to top it off, when I explain that I am not going to be a nurse, but a doctor, I typically get some sort of laughter and mocking/teasing reaction along the lines of ""oh you must be real smart then right"". My male colleague has been asked by strangers if he is a doctor when he is walking through public wearing scrubs. Meanwhile, I literally tell people I'm going to be a doctor and they still can't understand how I'm not a nursing student. 

Is this the norm for other women in medicine? Does this ever change in medical school or the workplace? I want to hear other stories and know what to expect.

medicine,Advice about handling a severe polytrauma patient in a motor vehicle accident.,"Mods, please delete if this doesn't belong here. 
I'm and MD in IM and this this is the only medical sub I hang out in. But if anyone knows of a sub better suited for this question, please let me know.

I was driving home today with my family when we came upon a car accident. As required by law (in the country where we reside) and morals, I got out to see if anyone was hurt. There were two cars involved. One was a van with an off-duty police officer and his dog. The guy was conscious, able to walk around (told him to lie down) and organizing help. 

The other car was a smaller car that was completely destroyed. As I got closer, I saw the driver lying on the front seats. 
In the countries that I lived and worked in, it is customary that MDs are sent out to severe accidents, so during internship, I had to accompany a few calls to observe for training (before I went into IM and didn't pursue emergency medicine)  and I've seen a share of car accidents, but this was ..... really really bad. The hood of the car was almost obliterated. The accident had just happened and the parts of the engine that were still around where fuming. There was gasoline everywhere. I and some others carefully approached the car to asses the situation and the driver was unconscious, weak pulse, no resp. He was stuck in the car spread on the both front seats (the back of the driver's seat being unhinged and somehow on top of the guy) and his neck was twisted in a very unnatural way (as were his visible extremities) like there was an unnatural angle at around C7. Other than that not much blood visible. 

I made sure someone called the emergency services and gave the necessary information. Then I sent bystanders to secure the road and spread out to the incoming cars to ask for fire extinguishers and any kind of rescue material (cloves, mask, whatever). There were two off-duty EMTs and we all came to the conclusion that without any means to put out a potential fire, it was too risky to get into the car and start any kind of resuscitation. 

I made sure the the guy in the other car was stable and taken care of, then we waited for the fire department. 
Once they had arrived and secured the scene, the ambulance got there as well and resuscitation was started (patient had no more pulse. The patient was evacuated from the car with a spine board and a lot of manpower, and then -later on -declared dead after failed resuscitation efforts. From what I could see, he probably had a c-spine injury, several broken limbs, probably damage to the pelvis and obviously trauma to thorax and abdomen. 

So, as I said, being in IM, I'm obviously not trained in the evacuation or on-site handling of patients with severe poly-trauma. 
I realise that the situation was dire to begin with. And before emergency services got there, we had no useful rescue material. 

I still feel so completely useless. I remembered being trained to not approach an accident if the scene is not safe. And I don't know much about cars in accidents but with all the fuming going on and the whole scene being drenched in gasoline, it just seemed risky to get into the car and start CPR. 

Should we have started CPR earlier. 
We estimated the risk too high and the chance of survival for the guy too low to get into a dangerous situation. But maybe I'm just a whiny wuss a d trying to justify my inaction? 
Was there anything we could have done differently? 

Also any advice on where to read up on how to be more useful next time? I already decided to get a fire extinguisher and ambu mask and maybe c-collar for our car (so far we only had gloves and bandages) Anything else I should think of? 

Thanks for any advice.",106,146,2017-06-07,PHARMA,0.14287149906158447,0.8287849426269531,0.028343556448817253

medicine,Optometrist here - I'd like to share a quick case presentation.,"Hello, Meddit! I had an interesting patient that I posted over at r/optometry that I think some of you might find interesting. A lot of the time, our job mostly includes prescribing eyeglasses and contacts, but I hope this case will show that a lot of our profession is adept at finding, diagnosing, and managing severe health conditions.

The patient was a 22 WM who presented to me for a routine eye exam. He didn't have glasses or contacts for about 3-4 months, but he did note when he last had his glasses he felt like everything was blurry out of his right eye even with the glasses on. No other ocular or visual complaints were noted.

Vision uncorrected OD 20/400 OS 20/200. PHNI OD, 20/20- OS.
Intraocular pressure was normal.

Prelims: EOMs were full and normal, no pain or diplopia. Confrontation fields were markedly restricted OD, normal OS. A grade 2 APD was seen OD. Cover test was slight XP @ distance. Color testing was abnormal OD, normal OS.

The patient refracted to 20/15 OS with -1.50 DS, which was unchanged since his previous exam. His old Rx of -1.50 DS in the OD yielded 20/200 vision, PHNI.

Biomicroscopy OS was normal posterior and anterior segment. OD ant segment was normal, but temporal pallor was noted OD.

A visual field was done while the patient was dilating: https://imgur.com/gallery/8Ok0D. I'll also post the final diagnosis in the comments if some people want to take some guesses/criticism on extra testing to be done. 

Clarification of some acronyms: OD: right eye OS: left eye PHNI: pinhole no improvement APD afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil) XP: exophoria DS: Diopter sphere

Edit: will update with final diagnosis today after work around 1700 UTC

 Wanted to ask you how you guys fight burnout? Residency has me exhausted, I feel pretty disconnected from friends, family and people in general, I don't really know how to put it in words. I'm doing my residency outside the US, so when I'm on call, sometimes my work days can last up to 32-36 hours, which is tiresome. The residency I am doing in particular isn't as bad as the surgical ones but still, I feel drained out, mostly from work, going home to study to improve and be better, and sometimes doing administrative work, because since I'm the ""resident"", nobody else does it. Sometimes I feel as if I'm wasting my young years working and studying instead of enjoying this time of my life that will probably never come back. Don't get me wrong, I love my job and learning, but I wanna be able to at the end of the day, go home, relax, sleep enough hours and go to work the next day.
I also feel lonely sometimes, most of my friends that didn't go to med school look at me like some workaholic freak or something similar. The little times I am able to meet up with them, I feel like they all have turned superficial, just talking about parties, drinking, people getting married, who is having a kid, etc, etc, while I am thinking about the stuff I see at work (diseases, sick people, trauma, etc etc) When people ask me about my job I tell them about it, but they either say like ""OMG you're soooo busy"" or ""you studyyy and work a lot"" or ""thats so gross, how can you do that?"" and they quickly change the subject. I feel like I have nothing in common with my old friends. 
People in the hospital are ok, but I mostly see them as coworkers, Ive gone out with them but its not the same and the talking subject is always about medicine.
I see a therapist sometimes to talk about this, I feel it helps but not enough, maybe I am impatient. I know you gotta do other stuff besides medicine so I joined a language club and a gym but for some reason I feel like something is lacking in my life. Sometimes I have to skip the gym/class because of work or cause I'm on call.
I wish the days would last longer so I could do more stuff but I feel like I'm on and endless cycle of getting up early, going to the hospital, working, and going back home, studying something or maybe skipping it because I am too tired, going to sleep late at night and repeat.

Any suggestions on how you guys do to fight this or what helps?",21,162,2017-06-11,PHARMA,0.11434311419725418,0.8597949147224426,0.025861915200948715

pharmacy,CVS's PCQ Calls - So Much Wasted Potential and Time,"Hey y'all, kinda wanted to rant about a program CVS has that sucks up so much of our time.

For those unfamiliar, PCQ, or ""patient care queue"" is a list that generates weekly of people who haven't refilled prescriptions that look, on our end, to be either due or past due. We are expected to call them 1-2 times on weekends (when the weekly list generates), and every weekday. The busier your store is, the longer your list is gonna be. For each person in the queue, usually 1-3 medications (sometimes way more) of theirs are listed, we're supposed to call them and ask them if they needed us to fill it for them.

Because the automated refill reminder calls weren't enough.

Anyway, on the surface, seems like a potentially decent idea to help compliance, right? Nah. Not when you design it as poorly as CVS does.

Here are some of the most common ""why would I call you"" things that pop up:

&gt; Medications with ""AS NEEDED"" in the SIG, like trazodone, albuterol HFA

&gt; Meloxicam or Flonase or antihistamines that were co-prescribed with a steroid +- antibiotic, with no refills

&gt; Medications in the same class which have obviously been exchanged. E.g. rosuvastatin will appear as being past due, if you look in their profile, they were prescribed atorvastatin last month - what are the odds they *didn't* switch from rosuvastatin to atorvastatin?

&gt; Medications that were last processed through mail order (running a test claim for those Express Scripts folks is too 'spensive for CVS, apparently)

&gt; Medications last filled under a ""MAIL ORDER BRIDGE SUPPLY"" third party.

&gt; Medications ""due"" for a refill based on days supply that do not account for the extra fill we did for them because they were going on vacation (i.e. they got 2 30-day supplies last time, so the medication is actually 30 days early, not due)

These kinds of things make it seem that this is mostly a front for ""let's see how much we can up our script count today."" Or maybe the software engineers had no idea they needed to consider these things because they weren't trained on any healthcare related topics. They say never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity, but with how ruthless CVS is with hours and metrics, I'm a bit cynical.

I haven't even mentioned ""ScriptSync"" calls. ScriptSync is CVS's shitty system whose intended purpose is to align all of a patient's prescriptions on a single day, so they don't have to make multiple trips each month. Depending on the timing, patients get ""alignment fills"" of less than their usual quantities so they have enough for their pickup day. The scripts are then set up to automatically refill each month. Sounds helpful, right?

Well, it's buggy as hell. If patients don't pick up their alignment fills (cuz they don't need them/want to make the trip) they end up with extra medication and possibly two flat copays. It only works on 30-day scripts, not 90-day scripts, and it cannot be used with controlled substances whatsoever. That's kinda expected, but, with how many people are on controls alongside their other medications, it makes aligning their other meds with their control(s) manually very time-consuming. In the process it might decide to return-to-stock those 10 alignment fills you just did, without warning.

What's even better is when family members with the same preferred contact number appear in the PCQ - as separate entries. Let's bug them twice when it could have been done all at once.

In my experience, only a handful of times have my calls to people in the PCQ list been worthwhile. For the most part, people haven't refilled their medications yet because they're *not running low yet* or they're getting it somewhere else.

These are just the technician's responsibilities. Pharmacists are expected to call people with new scripts to pick up every day, and once a week call a seemingly random patient that they think may have experienced an issue during their pharmacy trip. They also have calls to check in and see how people are doing on their medications, which, if we had the time to be thorough, I would see as being good.

---

I cannot stand PCQ calls. In their current state they are massive, broken time vacuums with metrics based on how many people we get to say ""yes fill this medication for me,"" which is incredibly flawed because of the many instances that *they shouldn't even be on the goddamn list.*

pharmacy,Efficiency of Using A Spacer vs. No Spacer with MDIs - Interesting Tidbits,"Hey guys,

So I'd known for a long time that using a spacer with MDIs help improve medication delivery to the lungs, but today I learned how dramatic the effects are. Thought this would be worth sharing with y'all since these details might not be common knowledge. Maybe it'll come in handy sometime.

I was reading this paper: [Investigation of some commercially available spacer devices for the delivery of glucocorticoid steroids from a pMDI.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11448047) If you can't access the full text, use Sci-Hub.

Quotes (emphasis mine):

&gt; Despite the advantages,  pMDIs [pressurized metered-dose inhalers] have many inherent disadvantages. When actuated, the active ingredient–propellant plume is emitted from the mouthpiece at such a rapid velocity (approximately 100 km/h) that **at least 80% of the dose collides with the back of the throat and deposits on the larynx and pharynx regions.** There is 10% deposited in the actuator, leaving only approximately 10% to reach the lung for desired therapeutic action (4,5–7,14).

No wonder it's so easy to get thrush if you don't rinse/gargle/spit after use! I also wonder how the efficiency compares to nasal sprays.

&gt; This phenomenon can lead to several undesirable outcomes. **Coughing and hoarseness result from particle deposition in the throat region and from the cold propellant effect produced as the propellant evaporates from the back of the throat (15).** For steroid maintenance therapy, deposition of the antiinflammatory agent in the oropharyngeal region leads to an overgrowth of Candida albicans, which ultimately causes thrush. Thrush is the major cause of therapeutic failure of the orally inhaled corticosteroids. Many of these problems occur because the patient is not able to coordinate inhalation of drug particles with the emission of drug following actuation (9).

Man, I've been on [Advair HFA](https://www.drugs.com/pro/fluticasone-and-salmeterol-inhalation.html) for years and thought that the occasional irritation during usage was because my lungs were sensitive, not from the propellant / particulates.

&gt; [...] Many authors have shown that these spacer devices actually **increase the fraction of an actuation delivered to the lungs up to 60%, while reducing the amount of active compound deposited in the oropharyngeal region to almost zero** (9–12,15–17). Thus, the therapeutic response is better, and the incidence of side effects, both systemic and local, is significantly reduced.

Way more dramatic than I would have guessed - reduced oropharyngeal deposition to almost zero? Crazy high potential for preventing thrush.

But.

Are most patients cleaning the spacers regularly? Properly? Are they replacing it when the manufacturer recommends? The spacer I use with my inhaler recommends replacement after 12 months. From my own experience, I can count on my hand how often I've seen people refilling spacers at my pharmacy - what about you guys? Seems like a potential risk as time goes on, eventually making the spacer provide little to no benefit, or worse, hinder drug delivery.

The paper also has a lot of technical information and considerations regarding particle dispersion, deposition, chamber volume, shape, and more, if any of you are interested in that.

Their conclusion:

&gt; [...] Regardless, the addition to a pMDI of any of the spacer devices investigated significantly enhanced the delivery of drug from an inhalation aerosol **irrespective of the metering chamber volume or type of drug used.**",8,35,2017-06-15,PHARMA,0.06884092837572098,0.9034237861633301,0.027735237032175064

Sometimes because someone didn't follow them, sometimes because someone claimed they were followed the wrong way.

We rarely discuss why we have the guidelines we have, and never if this constitutes the standard of care, if it is evidence based guidelines or if it is a list of what some people think you should do.

The latter is true, and it is actually based on animal studies during the 60ies, namely [Redding JS, Pearson JW. *Resuscitation from asphyxia.* JAMA. 1962 Oct 20;182:283-6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13973494/) and [Redding JS, Pearson JW. *Resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation. Drug therapy.* JAMA. 1968 Jan 22;203(4):255-60.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5694097/) where the second one found

&gt; Resuscitation [of dogs] was more successful when epinephrine was used than when no drug therapy or sodium bicarbonate were used. 

**Vasopressors**

The ACLS algorithm since at least 2009 have included adrenaline/epinephrine 1mg every 3-5 minutes. This is based on a single randomized study ([Jacobs IG, Finn JC, Jelinek GA, Oxer HF, Thompson PL. *Effect of adrenaline on survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.* Resuscitation. 2011 Sep;82(9):1138-43. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21745533) which is best summarized by their own conclusion

&gt; Patients receiving adrenaline during cardiac arrest had no statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge although there was a significantly improved likelihood of achieving ROSC.

ROSC isn't the end result of CPR, survivability is. The same conclusion is shown in other retrospective studies as well, e.g. [Hagihara A, Hasegawa M, Abe T, Nagata T, Wakata Y, Miyazaki S. *Prehospital epinephrine use and survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2012 Mar 21;307(11):1161-8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22436956) which concludes that while more patient in the epinephrine/adrenaline group achieved ROSC they were equally likely (actually slightly less likely) to be discharged.

Another study found that among patients who are at a hospital when they fall into cardiac arrest early ephinehrine/adrenaline push (as within 2 min of the first defibrillation which is against the guidelines that says after defibrillation nr 2) is associated with a worse outcome, per [Andersen LW, Kurth T, Chase M, Berg KM, Cocchi MN, Callaway C, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Investigators. *Early administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) in patients with cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm in hospital: propensity score matched analysis.* BMJ. 2016 Apr 6;353:i1577.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27053638)  
It is a short article, well worth a read (and it is open access), but here is an excerpt
&gt; In conclusion, we found that early administration of epinephrine after the first defibrillation (that is, contrary to guidelines) was common (&gt;50%) in patients who experience cardiac arrest in hospital with a shockable rhythm. Moreover, the provision of epinephrine at this time point was associated with a decreased chance of good outcome, including decreased in hospital survival.

**The AHA guidelines**

The ACLS guidelines are heavily based on the [AHA guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956224/).  They say
&gt; It is **reasonable to consider** administering a 1 mg dose of IV/IO epinephrine every 3 to 5 minutes during adult cardiac arrest.

Reasonable to consider is the wording used. Think about that for a minute. 

I would also like to add that high doses of epinephrine/adrenaline is associated with a worse outcome. If that is because the patient is in cardiac arrest for longer, or because the people doing it are less experienced and doesn't follow protocol is hard for me to say. 

**Amiodarone**

There are 2 studies (ALIVE and ARREST). Neither was powered to really detect what we are interested in (survivability). 

The first of these two, [Dorian P, Cass D, Schwartz B, Cooper R, Gelaznikas R, Barr A. *Amiodarone as compared with lidocaine for shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 2002 Mar 21;346(12):884-90.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11907287) found that more patients who got amiodarone was admitted to the hospital, but failed to show (due to how it was constructed) that they were discharged more often. The second trial ([Kudenchuk PJ, Cobb LA, Copass MK, Cummins RO, Doherty AM, Fahrenbruch CE, Hallstrom AP, Murray WA, Olsufka M, Walsh T. *Amiodarone for resuscitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 1999 Sep 16;341(12):871-8.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10486418) showed the same, but didn't focus on survival to hospital discharge.

Therefor the evidence is lacking. And again from the AHA  
&gt; Amiodarone may be considered for VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy (Class IIb, LOE B). An initial dose of 300 mg IV/IO can be followed by 1 dose of 150 mg IV/IO.

**Edit 1.** /u/transmogrification pointed me towards another study, more recent then the above, [Kudenchuk PJ et al. *Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest*. N Engl J Med. 2016 May 5;374(18):1711-22.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27043165). This study concludes that

&gt; neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.

but also

&gt; Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered.

So there still may be a difference, but you would need 9000 study participants to find it with a 90% certainty. If it did have an effect of ca 3% that would be 1800 lives per year it could save, but the data as is doesn't support an effect larger than 3%.

**Fibrinolysis**

A lot of cardiac arrests are due to PE or AMI, and it would there go to reason that treating the clots would have an effect on survival. The problem is that when you give tPA you don't actually know why the patient went into cardiac arrest, and there hasn't been shown any benefit (a bit better effect on survival to ICU admission has been found), see [Böttiger BW, Arntz HR, Chamberlain DA, Bluhmki E, Belmans A, Danays T, Carli PA, Adgey JA, Bode C, Wenzel V; TROICA Trial Investigators; European Resuscitation Council Study Group. *Thrombolysis during resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.* N Engl J Med. 2008 Dec 18;359(25):2651-62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19092151) and [Böttiger BW, Bode C, Kern S, Gries A, Gust R, Glätzer R, Bauer H, Motsch J, Martin E. *Efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy after initially unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a prospective clinical trial.* Lancet. 2001 May 19;357(9268):1583-5.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11377646).

If we could select the right patients that may change, and with an increased amount of ultrasound used by ICU docs and even used during CPR we may be at a point where it is worth redoing such a study at a hospital (my own point of view).

**Edit 2** As pointed out by the PEAPETT study [Sharifi M, Berger J, Beeston P, Bay C, Vajo Z, Javadpoor S; “PEAPETT” investigators. *Pulseless electrical activity in pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolysis (from the ""PEAPETT"" study).* Am J Emerg Med. 2016 Oct;34(10):1963-1967](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422214) and /u/macreadyrj there have been newer studies then the ones cited above. However PEAPETT included 23 patients where 16 had a previous diagnosis of PE by CT pulmonary angiography, which isn't the case for a random cardiac arrest and 3 were diagnosed with PE by ultrasound criteria. I would thus interpret the study more as a safety study than anything else, since it also didn't show any significant bleedings. 

**Sodium bicarb**

The AHA states
&gt; There are few data to support therapy with buffers during cardiac arrest. There is no evidence that bicarbonate improves the likelihood of defibrillation or survival rates in animals with VF cardiac arrest. A wide variety of adverse effects have been linked to administration of bicarbonate during cardiac arrest. Bicarbonate may compromise CPP by reducing systemic vascular resistance.

And the study this is based at least partly on [Vukmir RB, Katz L; Sodium Bicarbonate Study Group. *Sodium bicarbonate improves outcome in prolonged prehospital cardiac arrest*. Am J Emerg Med. 2006 Mar;24(2):156-61.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16490643) which despite the name states
&gt; **The empirical early administration of sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg) has no effect on the overall outcome in prehospital cardiac arrest.** However, a trend toward improvement in prolonged (&gt;15 minutes) arrest outcome was noted.

It should be said that there are specific circumstances were bicarb has it's use, but routinely using it simply hasn't been shown effective as stated by the AHA
&gt; In some special resuscitation situations, such as preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or tricyclic antidepressant overdose, bicarbonate can be beneficial

**Edit 3. Endotracheal Intubation** 

Per the AHA
&gt; However, intubation attempts by unskilled providers can produce complications, such as trauma to the oropharynx, interruption of compressions and ventilations for unacceptably long periods, and hypoxemia from prolonged intubation attempts or failure to recognize tube misplacement or displacement. It is now clear that the incidence of complications is unacceptably high when intubation is performed by inexperienced providers or monitoring of tube placement is inadequate.

There aren't any high quality studies and only a few retrospective studies, one of them saying that early intubation has a trend toward better survival at 24hrs; [Wong ML, Carey S, Mader TJ, Wang HE; American Heart Association National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Investigators. *Time to invasive airway placement and resuscitation outcomes after inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest*. Resuscitation. 2010 Feb;81(2):182-6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022157) and one study of poorly trained EMS on intubation of children failed to find an effect (and remember we think that ventilation is more important in children than in adults) [Gausche M, Lewis RJ. *Out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation of children*. JAMA. 2000 Jun 7;283(21):2790-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10838643).

A more recent study in Japan [Hasegawa K, Hiraide A, Chang Y, Brown DF. *Association of prehospital advanced airway management with neurologic outcome and survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2013 Jan 16;309(3):257-66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23321764) found that
&gt; Among adult patients with OHCA [out of hospital cardiac arrest], any type of advanced airway management was independently associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival compared with conventional bag-valve-mask ventilation.

You also have another study, [Kajino K, Iwami T, Kitamura T, Daya M, Ong ME, Nishiuchi T, Hayashi Y, Sakai T, Shimazu T, Hiraide A, Kishi M, Yamayoshi S. *Comparison of supraglottic airway versus endotracheal intubation for the pre-hospital treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. Crit Care. 2011;15(5):R236.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985431) which found two things. A supraglottic airway is equally effective to endotracheal intubation, but having a person certified to do endotracheal intubation was associated with a better outcome regardless of wether they did or didn't. Early placement of an advanced airway was associated with a better outcome.

**Edit 4**
Thanks to dr /u/CytokineShitStorm for pointing me to this study, [Andersen LW, Granfeldt A, Callaway CW, Bradley SM, Soar J, Nolan JP, Kurth T, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation Investigators. *Association Between Tracheal Intubation During Adult In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Survival*. JAMA. 2017 Feb 7;317(5):494-506.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118660) which is a 2017 observational study on cardiac arrest in the hospital setting which found
&gt;Although differences existed in prespecified subgroup analyses, intubation was not associated with improved outcomes in any subgroup. [...] Among adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, initiation of tracheal intubation within any given minute during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation, compared with no intubation during that minute, was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.

and thus it doesn't support intubating patients even at a hospital setting. As the guidelines stand intubation may still be the way to go, and by intubating the patient you may free up valuable resources. I always have an ICU/OR/anesthesia nurse present who can maintain any advanced airway or ventilate the patient if necessary so for me it wouldn't tie up any more hands to not intubate the patient.

medicine,Fevers confuse me,"Currently, I'm finishing up intern year and as I progress onto seniorhood soon, I'd like to make sure I understand better everything we take for granted and do as protocol in our hospital and every day practice.

Fevers and our response to them is one thing that I've always had a lot of trouble with.
Typically, the scenario will arise that a nurse will call you for a temperature of 100.4, which it seems is the general consensus for the definition of a fever. At that point, we're stressed by our seniors and attendings to draw blood cultures immediately.
I was looking into Mandell's and also IDSA guidelines, and it seems to really confuse me on official recommendations on whether or not that's the correct practice.


IDSA seems to say in [one article](http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedFiles/IDSA/Guidelines-Patient_Care/PDF_Library/2008%20NewFever%20in%20Critically%20Ill.pdf):

""
5. A new onset of temperature of&gt;38.3°C is a reasonable trigger for a
clinical assessment but not necessarilya laboratory or radiologic evaluation
for infection (level 3).


6. A new onset of temperature of 36.0°C in the absence of a known
cause of hypothermia (e.g., hypothyroidism,cooling blanket, etc.) is a reasonabletrigger for a clinical assessment but not necessarily a laboratory
or radiologic evaluation for infection(level 3).""


And their definition for fever for a critically ill patient seems to be:
""The definition of fever is arbitrary and depends on the purpose
for which it is defined. Some literature defines fever as a core temperature
of &gt;38.0°C (100.4°F) (2– 4), whereasother sources define fever as two consecutive elevations of &gt;38.3°C (101.0°F). In patients who are neutropenic, fever has been defined as a single oral temperature
of &gt;38.3°C (101.0°F) in the absence of an obvious environmental cause, or a temperature elevation of &gt;38.0°C (100.4°F) for &gt;1 hr (4)""

Whereas in an article on the evaluation of [fever in LTC facilities](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/cid/48/2/10.1086_595683/1/48-2-149.pdf?Expires=1497928453&amp;Signature=bTByE6I7~9YXAn~a9RMrMfL994EhGPbi4JVgmAQq2Jmw8OmJ-Qzd2vsO31vg6LTIsh06yC0d0V5VNfSoCn6AjI153anhB2HyiI4SSqN9RyFFzi0uCHyM5YsuYObfMAkZ1~ACRwnoG4bC3nAISy~RwZkhAp~ygtket5hny1e8caKBNS8ntUvmiW8hzyAW9BMXj-yCcMpTjq149BQyWMOkjUYNXxpsZjjWCMggj2Ypc7VuLXM9XOzJ3lgvagomb9urCMtdghA0BWJBB7ePhtE8CKdd~9N6NAz0NVFd5FdyZC2H6eTPhbsYZHBFCkJWlpkAdngOwnnealUqwzJ3SyMtnw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q) their definition is:

""Fever, defined as: (1) A single oral temperature &gt;100F (&gt;37.8C); or (2) repeated oral temperatures &gt;99F (&gt;37.2C) or rectal temperatures &gt;99.5F (&gt;37.5C); or (3) an increase in temperature of &gt;2F (&gt;1.1C) over the baseline temperature (B-III).""

Which is a much, much lower threshold that anything we've used in the hospital.


In addition, I am doubly as confused in evaluating repeat fevers when judging response to therapy. For instance, I've had ID drop notes that say fevers as low as 100.4-100.6 aren't ""real"" fevers while the patient is on antibiotics, and that this doesn't indicate treatment failure. But a fever of &gt;101 seems to imply that we need to broaden coverage. But I've had a hard time finding primary literature that implies this is good practice. It's also hard to tell what time course someone is allowed to continue to have fevers on newly initiated antibiotics before you decide to add on more.



So I guess my questions to you guys are:

* What is your threshold for calling something a fever and what's your general threshold for culturing in someone with unclear symptoms? Do you culture on a single 100.4? Do you culture on a sustained 100.4 for &gt; 1 hour? Or do you hold off to a temp of 101.0 and up? Do you use the lower thresholds for elderly patients suggested in the second article?

* How long do you wait out continued fever spikes on someone newly started on antibiotics? How high of a spike do you consider broadening or changing treatment?


Sorry for the long post. Maybe these seem like really stupid questions. But for better or worse, I'll be calling a lot of shots next year, and this is one of many topics that still confuses me.
If you guys have references too, that'll help a lot, and I'd really appreciate it.",51,184,2017-06-19,PHARMA,0.055820282548666,0.9098330736160278,0.03434661403298378

medicine,Severe burnout,"I’m hoping any one can share some perspective or maybe offer a reality check. To be frank, I’m midway through my residency and I’m severely burned out (in accordance with the Maslach Burnout Inventory). I’m at the point where I wake up dreading the bull and coming home every day so furious that I just need to hit something or cry in the shower. 
I just feel like I ended up in the wrong career. I’m sick of dealing with uncaring nurses who can’t follow a verbal order, even if a patient needs to be stabilized NOW. I’m tired of the petty little notes when I don’t respond to their request for their Tylenol but then have to tamper my expectations if critical diagnostic testing like lactic acids and EKGs don’t get drawn. I’m tired of being told to accept this substandard crap. I’m tired of being handed off critical patients with the other residents scurrying away as soon as it’s time to punch out. I’m tired of dealing with the shitty attitudes of the interns who are “bored” of their patients and want “interesting cases” and then bitch when they have to take an admission. Fuck it, I’m even tired of seeing patients in the clinic setting and listening to the litany of never ending problems. 
I dearly regret my decisions that led me to medicine. I’m… tired. I’m exhausted. I don’t care about other people’s feelings and I don’t even know why I show up to work anymore. The only answer I get is to suck it up in this piss poor excuse for healthcare and to hope for something better.

medicine,"Potential diverting anesthesiologist. No firm evidence, how to test?","Colleagues, throwaway account for obvious reasons...

I am an anesthesiologist, I suspect that one of my partners is impaired/diverting anesthetic drugs.

In the course of a year, my partner has had a nurse raise a concern regarding ""odd"" behavior during a case (other partners responded and provided relief from his/her clinical responsibilities and recognized that this partner was acting strangely), since then this partner was found breathing, but completely unresponsive at the head of the table during a case (they recovered completley in 10 minutes or so and subsequent drug testing and medical evaluation were negative), and this partner, despite his/her otherwise hard working attitude, has ""overslept"" more than once in the past year (we still practice MD only anesthesia, oversleeping is not acceptable, you have to be here).

In the first instance, the ""odd behavior"" was explained away with the addition/adjustment of an antidepressant that they were taking that can cause some sedation.  Amitryptyline, yeah, that's possible.

In the second instance, we insisted that he/she go to the ER for evaluation and drug testing.  Drug testing negative, but we later find out that our ER's standard drug test does not detect fentanyl.  Additionally, through some nurses description of events,   I have some reason to believe that my partner may be sniffing Sevo and not injecting the much more common fentanyl.

So, our ER appears to be unequipped to test for fentanyl routinely (that dumbfounds me) but they are obviously incapable of testing for Sevoflurane.

I have no idea how to test for sevoflurane abuse.

medicine,"NP introducing herself as a ""medical doctor""","I'm pretty sure the title alone should come with a trigger warning. I know it sounds too good/bad to be anything but a troll, but rest assured I'm not making this up. My GF is a CNA (nurse's assistant) and about to start on her BSN. At her hospital, there's a NP that's apparently quite rude to the RNs, CNAs, and everyone else she deems beneath her. That alone is shitty and unprofessional coming from a physician, and even worse coming from a practitioner than didn't go to medical school and used to a nurse.

The icing on the cake is that she walks into patients' rooms wearing a white coat and introduces herself as a medical doctor. My GF's actual example was ""Hi, I'm Dr. X, I'm the medical doctor this morning doing rounds."" This particular state's only laws regarding how an ""advanced practice nurse"" may introduce themselves is that they may refer to themselves as ""certified nurse midwife"", ""clinical nurse specialist"", ""certified registered nurse anesthetist"", or ""nurse practitioner"". Given the lack of legislation around calling herself ""Dr. X"", that is likely technically legal since she has a DNP degree (doctoral level), even if it's pretty unsavory. Actually referring to oneself as a medical doctor without an MD/DO degree is a different story. Presumably, this would be classified as criminal impersonation (though I'm obviously not a lawyer), because I don't believe the state has specific statutes concerning the impersonation of a physician.

Anyone care to comment, particularly on what she ought to do? My only thought is to report her to the hospital and/or licensing board (apparently the nurses there can't stand her). One issue there is a lack of proof; the only time she says this nonsense is in patients' rooms, and recording under such circumstances is likely to be out of the question due to patient privacy concerns. Is she just SOL and has to deal with a rude superior that introduces herself as a physician to patients? I'd love to hear y'all's take.

medicine,[serious] Inappropriate or ok?

medicine,The Other Side: An EM Intern’s First Shift.,"*Preface: I shared this with /r/medicalschool and I wanted to share it here with /r/medicine as well. I have changed certain presentations and details to maintain relative anonymity. I wanted to share this narrative to let people see my perspective as a new EM intern. It is long, so please- feel free to ignore it.*

All the best,

-wtffng

I arrive 30 minutes early to find my ID badge won’t unlock the double wide magnetically guarded doors to the ED. It’s the morning shift, so someone should be close behind me- therefore, I pull out my phone, furrow my eyebrows, and completely pretend to be doing something important.

A nurse walks by briskly and successfully swipes through the door with me stealthily following behind her. I walk to the resident workroom to find my key doesn’t work there either. A PGY-3 spies me fumbling and with a laugh pulls the door wide open.

He’s smiling. He’s excited for us to be starting. It’s genuine. He runs me through some basic charting requirements that haven’t been covered in 2+ weeks of HR classes and orientation, which at this point have all blurred together, interwoven between each night’s social adventures.

My shift begins at 07:00, and at 6:45 there’s a loud page “TRAUMA ACTIVATION, ROOM 4.” A grinning attending appears from nowhere, introduces herself- and instructs me to go to the trauma bay.

A life threatening gun shot wound is arriving via ambulance and we’re tying our gowns down. The room is calm, but swelling with people and heat- everyone mutually understanding that this will most likely be futile.

An older nurse peers around the room, trying to ascertain who to eliminate.

“WHOEVER’S NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED, LEAVE NOW,” she instructs, likely insinuating me. Several people scurry out the doors and I turn to leave, finding myself facing another attending who firmly says: “Stay here.”

The nurse starts circulating, instructing people she doesn’t recognize to leave. I’m fully gowned with a mask, but I know this won't protect me. As she nears, I turn to the trauma cart and pretend that I’m seeking some device which will be useful in the near future. She passes and I turn back, an escapee.

The patient is rolled in and movement starts. Intubation, CPR - but within minutes it is determined that yes, this is most certainly futile, and the patient's time of death is called.

I walk back to my ED section to receive sign-outs. The attending looks up warmly:

“Welcome to the Emergency Department, Dr. Wtffng.”

There are three Interns, one PA, and one Attending. The attending looks around and wonders aloud “Do we have no senior here? No? Looks like a busy day.”

We’ve been informed that as interns our expectation for these first shifts are simply this: Do an HPI. Learn the system. Be honest.

I haven’t done an EM shift in 2 years now, and my excitement is tempered by the growing realization that after 8+ years of education, I might know nothing.

I push back against this thinking and set to work as the clock strikes 07:00. I look up at the patient board and see red rapidly disappearing as the team logins to the EHR. I scan the list and pick up the first one I see- a seizure.

The patient’s from out of town, no history available. No worries, I’ve done seizure work-ups plenty of times in the past, right?

As I walk towards the room the nurse pulls back the curtain and exits.

“Hi! I’m WTF, the intern working with you today for the first time here.” We exchange formalities and he is kind. He’s patient. I ask him to let me know if he needs anything and what he thinks about the patient.

So here it goes. The first patient seen with an MD straggling along behind my name.

“Hello, I’m WTF FNG, call me WTF. I’m the resident doctor taking care of you this morning.”

The patient is younger. Engaged. Smart. Here for work and he certainly knows more about seizures than I do. He informs me he’s got important things to do, and he hasn’t slept well the last couple nights and had a couple drinks the previous- likely the cause.

I do an HPI and order labs. I’m trying to contact an outpatient neurologist in some far away state who I soon realize doesn’t want to respond to pages sent from East Coast Time.

I pick up another patient, dizziness. I whisk into the room to find a pleasant older woman who is here only because her son was concerned. She’s got important things to do, and wants to escape this place to her cabin for the weekend.

I tidy up things for my first patient and discharge him. He looks at me says “Hey- Thank you, that was really quick and thorough.”

I laugh and respond “Hey I appreciate that. Don’t tell anyone on your way out- but it’s my first day as a doctor.”

I smile, shake his hand and leave before I can see if his face drops into disappointment. I exit the room to find the nurse standing there, obviously overhearing this statement, with an expression somewhere between amusement and scorn.

I am admitting the woman with dizziness and break the news that she likely won’t be making it to her cabin this weekend. There’s soft pushback. I explain that if she were my mother I’d want her to stay in the hospital for further evaluation, and I would.

There’s a small pause and I blurt out “if you want, you can call me Dr. WTF FNG, RUINER OF WEEKENDS. I propose a weekend of awful hospital food and cable TV rather than a relaxing weekend at the cabin.”
She stares at me for a moment, and begins to laugh. She agrees to stay. I exit the room again to find the nurse holding onto an expression somewhere between concern and breaking laughter.

These damn curtains. I speak loudly and everyone can hear my weak passes at wit.

I step backwards onto a small neurologist who has somehow snuck behind me. He does not feel that another patient of mine warrants a neurological consult but he’s already here in the ED and he’s trapped. Success. A tap on my shoulder saves me from the debate and I set to fix one of the many problems I’ve created from bumbling through the EHR.

I don’t know how to document properly for billing, admit correctly for admissions, and discharge sufficiently to get the patient out. The PA is a saint. Seriously. Every question is answered patiently, from phone numbers to drug dosing. My attending, also up for canonization- is juggling every patient in the section while teaching three interns. The nurses are supportive, and graceful as they inform me of each small misstep and how to fix it. I can tell I'm slowing them down, but they're as understanding as over-worked nurses can afford to be, and I'm damn appreciative of this.

I sit and try to catch up on non-existent notes and again my shoulder is tapped as I’m halfway through a sent-

“That’s you.” The nurse informs me.

“What?” I respond confusedly.

“Trauma to Bay 4.”

“What?”

“You. That’s you. Go to Trauma Bay 4.”

It clicks. Those overhead pages now address me at this time.

The rest of my shift blows by, fueled by pretzels and coffee. I see the sick and ill alongside the worried well. I witness the aftermath of tragedy that will surface darkly in the newspaper days later.

Each time I sit to chart, my phone rings or my shoulder is tapped. I incorrectly place and fix orders. I am slow. I feel I know nothing. Things that went so fast as a medical student take longer now, and are so much more complex. There was no magic click or growth following the MD that was placed behind my name a month ago. I am still just me, with the same knowledge base. As I work I realize the auditioning medical students likely, or perhaps certainly- know more than me.

I can feel hard in my gut that I don’t have a flow, nor method to manage the tasks constantly flooding me. My shift ends and I melt into a chair in the resident workroom to catch up on my mangled notes.

Two senior residents slide into the room and flop down on the couch. They are on an off-service rotation and enjoying the periodic downtime and freedom.

“So how’d it go?”

I explain my concerns about flow and knowledge, pace and expectations.
They laugh.

“It comes with time. You guys are doing great, seriously. It’s a whole new approach and we all do it a little differently. In a couple months you’ll be managing all of this and more with ease.”

They pause and one asks “So what did you think?”

I sit for a second and scan my hazy memory of the past 9 hours. For a moment my gut relaxes.

“It was awesome. I made the right choice.”

They laugh.

pharmacy,PSA: Free Live Immunization CE Series hosted by CDC,"For those of you who may not be aware, CDC hosts a series of live CEs each year which comprises several immunization topics. It just started two weeks ago and runs through October (one session almost every week).

Apparently the live CE does not expire until a couple of weeks after the event occurs, so if you aren't able to watch live, you can actually view the video content after it's been posted and still get the live credit. I'm fairly sure that I did this during last year's series and still received the live credit (don't hold me to this though). These CEs also count toward any immunization requirements you may have. There are 15 one-hour sessions, which probably fulfills the live CE requirements for many states if you're okay with all your CE being about immunizations. Note that CDC says they cap to 1,500 people per session, so may be first come first served (not sure if this applies to CE credit or if that's just the limit that their webinar can handle at once).
