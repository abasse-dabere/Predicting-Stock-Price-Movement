44yoM PMHx Chlamydia, IVDA p/w fever, chills, ""WHOML"" x4 days. CTH w/wo showed no acute bleed or lession, LP most suspicious for viral meningitis (elevated protein, although no white count).


Guy has all the stigmata of immunocompromise, herpetic sores on his lips, oral thrush, penile discharge, cough productive of green sputum, diffuse LAD.


Adamantly refuses HIV test, direct quote: ""You mention HIV again and I'm calling my lawyer""


CBC w/ diff shows lymphopenia, the resident and I asked the attending if we could do a lymphocyte subset, she agrees that it would not be a violation of his rights (note: I'm in NY http://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/providers/regulations/).


CD4 count comes back as 6, not 6%, total number 6. (Not the lowest I've seen, but others were in people with long Hx of HIV, non-compliant with HAART)


We were calling it (as in the post title) Idiopathic isolated CD4 lymphopenia, but what's the best course of action here, NYS requires reporting, and this guy is definately sexually active with multiple partners.

medicine,Using brand names vs. generic names when talking about drugs,"I've been hanging around on /r/medicine for a few months now, and one thing that's slowly become more obvious to me is the unusually high proportion of people on here who refer to medicines by their trade name rather than a generic name (INN, BAN, etc.). From my time in the hospital, primary care clinics, medical school and day-to-day life here in New Zealand, it is almost always the generic name that is used whenever people are communicating to each other. There are a handful of exceptions that come to mind, mostly patients using brand names for common OTC painkillers.

Upon further investigation, it seems like this is not a feature of /r/medicine, but rather due to the predominantly USA demographic of the people who post here. For whatever reason, [Americans tend to use brand names for drugs](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-006-0074-3). I find it to be a lot clearer and simpler to communicate using only the generic names, especially when a conversation includes people from several countries. Brand names are notoriously inconsistent between countries.

pharmacy,Any point in trying to file a complaint with board of pharmacy?,"First and foremost, the PA state board of pharmacy is a complete sham. Non-PA pharmacists should be glad they do not have to endure the most unorganized and ignorant excuse of an organization. I'm sure other people can tell their stories of how that board has no idea what is going on with their own paperwork and system, because I have heard it from everyone I have graduated with. Basically, any time you question the status of your paperwork, they tell you they have no idea until it has been processed. So you wait 3 weeks, until you receive some BS letter.

I began the process of reciprocating my license to PA in March. That went relatively OK. Beginning of April I realized I needed an immunization license for PA (my current state just required the APhA certificate) I submitted for that in April. You have to get your immunization license in PA within 2 years of taking the course. I took it in May 2012.

I'm a med student and as I was reading pharmacology (specifically Ach agonists/antagonists) I came across some of the effects the ANS has on the eye (specifically on the regulation of pupil diameter).

I was wondering if this phyisiological pathway could be the one associated to the photophobia caused by Influenza or other febril syndromes. My presumption would be that stress caused by infection tends to increase the simpathetic stimulation throughout the entire body, thus causing *excessive* mydriasis.
So, could this be the reason? If not, what is the mechanism that is associated with photophobia?

medicine,Hospitals Adopting Mobile Apps,"With mobile technologies becoming more sophisticated and patient consumerism driving value in health care, some hospitals have identified opportunities in the market and are adopting and leveraging mobile platforms to improve not only the quality of care, but also the experience. 
 
* New York Presbyterian Hospital teamed up with a local tech firm to build ""Presby Hangouts"" which allows patients staying at the hospital to connect with other patients, play games with one another, and communicate with one another via text message or video chat. Clinicians have also used the app to deliver educational material to groups of patients. 

* Mount Sinai is currently piloting an iPad app that gives patients a detailed schedule of their upcoming treatments, procedures, and tests. The goal of the app is to alleviate patient stress by keeping them informed with a real-time snapshot of their clinical care information. 

* Northridge Hospital Medical Center in Northridge, CA, has begun using an emergency room app to streamline care and reduce wait times. In order to schedule an appointment online, patients must check a box saying they are able to wait for treatment. Patients can also use the app to schedule appointments at urgent care locations and primary care offices.

pharmacy,Quit CVS/Pharmacy after working for them for 5 years and went to an independent pharmacy. Best decision ever.,"Full disclosure, I was a part of the Longs Drugs acquisition in 2008 that was fully implemented by 2009.  I worked for Longs and CVS/Pharmacy a combined 16 years but only joined the pharmacy portion of Longs in 2005.   Needless to say once CVS came on board and removed Longs from the picture things took a turn for the worse.

Never in my life have I felt so stressed out on a daily basis.  Yes, there comes stress with every line of work but it got to the point where I began developing anxiety as the workload became too much for myself to handle.

Of course when CVS first took over and implemented their new RX Connect system they gave the stores plenty of help.  Fast forward five years later and it's less than half the staffing for nearly the same amount of prescriptions to fill.  

At my store we filled approximately 2,300 RX's per week.  Monday-Friday on average we'd have around 4 techs (sometimes less) and the opening and closing pharmacist.  Barely enough to get by and even try to stay afloat on a regular basis.  Forget your day if someone called in sick you might as well throw the towel in and pray that you don't end up behind.

Typically when you fall behind one day it takes nearly two days to get fully caught up (heaven forbid if you have a weak weekend crew).

Oh, and you can forget about taking breaks.  I can honestly say there wasn't a day that I worked with CVS where I actually took my legally mandated breaks.  It wasn't because a manager wouldn't let me, but rather the CVS model wouldn't let you.

Yes, because your work force is so thinly spread out, even if you're gone for 15 minutes it could mean the difference between being caught up and falling behind.  Why would I want to take a break knowing that the stress level would only increase when I returned to work?

I know what you might be thinking, that it's an isolated case at my store with incompetent staffing that needs to be trained properly.  Sure, that's the half of it, but CVS doesn't offer adequate training to begin with.

As a lead tech with CVS I can tell you that the training they give is not satisfactory to perform one's duties.  It's 4 hours of pick-up training, 4 hours of production, and 8 hours of typing.  

Anyone familiar with a pharmacy can tell you how insufficient that is.  After that it's up to your pharmacy supervisor to follow up with adequate training thereafter, which never happens, why?

Employees get pigeon-holed at pickup all the time which causes for such high turnover at stores.  This is because stores simply don't have the time to develop employees because they don't want to fall behind on their filling with such tight restrictions on hourly budgets.  

New hires fall by the wayside because managers don't have time to train them, and then when they need to put them at somewhere like drop-off they're severely inadequate forcing them to be put at pickup all day as they become more and more frustrated at that spot without seeing any opportunities for upward advancement in the pharmacy.

It's a vicious cycle in CVS, they want everyone to take time to help the customers, but pharmacists will be written-up for not verifying prescriptions fast enough based on a weekly report.

CVS's unrealistic expectation is for pharmacists to essentially drive 75 mph in a 35 mph zone.  It's dangerous, risky and lives could be affected by such reckless work habits.

Yes, I have overheard district managers telling pharmacists that if it's been verified at least 3 times already to just pass it through without even looking at the hard copy.  Yet all the time I see pharmacists writing up incident reports on refills because of such practice.  And yes , if it's the 3rd or 4th fill, they have to write a report for each incorrect fill.

By the way, that extensive report is due within 24 hours of first noticing it, failure to write it up could result in termination with the company.  Oh by the way, you have about 4 waiters due in the next 4 minutes so you'd better get on those right away.

Don't forget your customers in line who CVS expects you to take care of immediately (60 second transactions is my understanding), but you have to ask for that extra care card, need to ask them if they want their RX on ready fill (auto refilling) and then any additional offer that's going on (donations for Easter Seals, sign-up for the 10 scripts = 5 dollars, asking everyone if they had a flu shot, etc;) and you see where I'm going with this.

You also have those three lines on hold that you're trying to answer, meanwhile your waiters keep building up because your pharmacist is away on a consult talking about vitamins and supplements with a patient.  

I was recently presented with an offer to work at an independent pharmacy, one with over 20 employees working on a daily basis that fills almost twice as many scripts (they bill DME as well) and I couldn't be happier.  

There's very little to no stress, I don't feel overwhelmed when I walk in the door and my anxiety has nearly disappeared.  

So my advice, do whatever you can to avoid working for CVS.  It's only going to get worse from what I've been told and with My Schedule being rolled out more cuts can be expected.  

Edit: TL;DR, worked for CVS for 5 years as lead tech, the company is taking a turn for a worse with budget cuts left and right leaving me overwhelmed and suffering from anxiety.  Left recently for an independent pharmacy and couldn't be happier.",31.0,52,2014-08-09,PHARMA,0.3670937046408653,0.5982081294059753,0.034698170609772205

biotech,Trying to get into the business side of biotech. Looking for some advice.,"Hey there! 

So I have just graduated from and undergrad in biology in Canada and have been looking to pursue a career in the business side of biology and was wondering if my line of thinking makes sense. Please let me know what you think!

After taking a 5th year to do an undergraduate thesis and to test out what doing research would be like I found myself fairly un-enamoured with the idea of doing research. I didn't do my project in the area that I'm really interested in (synthetic biology and general industrial genetics with a special, yet not exclusive interest in biofuels) instead doing a project in nanobiotech on devloping anisotropic silver. Thus I did not enjoy the topic to any great extent but ultimately found that research may not be for me even if I were to do it again in my desired field of interest. 

This has brought me to my current train of thought. While research may not be for me, I still do love science and reading about genetics and synthetic biology a great deal (currently reading a few textbooks on the topic as well as reading several journal reviews). So having taken and done very well in several business electives I took in my undergrad I am looking to get a job in biotech on the business side. I am currently applying to a few mbiotech programs that have an emphasis in business skills and project management. Eventually I would like to potentially get a job in product development or project management for particular products etc but this is somewhat based on my own impression of what that career would be like rather than real experience in such a thing. 

Has anyone else tried to make such a transition, if so how did they go about it? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks redditors!",5.0,4,2014-08-13,PHARMA,0.025085335597395897,0.9371528625488281,0.037761855870485306

I got over the foot ache problem, for the most part, so there's that. What have I got to love about Walgreens?

I'm loving my hours. It's actually pretty nice, I still get time to do a bit of stuff on the side. I've got a great team of techs and pharmacists who want to help me out as much as I can, and I definitely have made some stumbles that definitely could have been avoided, but I'm still learning, and there's a lot of things going on and a lot of things to remember. I love the idea that there's medications that I've never even remotely heard of, and it's always nice to just talk to a pharmacist and be like, hey what does this do? Never heard of this before. Every day I'm always learning something new, whether it be about a drug or some kinda insurance thingamajig.

Are there some dislikes? I think the drive-thru is unnecessary. I'm only a technician, but I really like being able to communicate with someone face to face. I feel like it's a more genuine experience, and often times the drive thru customers just want to get out of there ASAP and they seem to try and rush me to do my job faster. Even knowing that I'm new, they really don't seem to care. :( As a more minor gripe, I've got my ECCs down to a fault enough so that when I go to a store and purchase something for myself, I end up using those slogans when I'm making those purchases. ._. It's really funny stuff. What else... oh yeah, those PPLs! I kind of wish they were more in-depth, covering the depth of insurance issues. I felt like it was just too fundamental, like things I could have learned after two hours on the job. **I'm still fumbling with insurances so please, if you guys are familiar with IC+ and the insurance companies, help me please! I seem to stumble quite a bit, because I'm not realizing that a person code or something needs to be attached to the group number.** Other than that, I guess I'm only struggling a lot because this is still really new to me, and I'm hastily trying to recall a bunch of rules. :P Anyone have any tips to make insurance easier on me?

pharmacy,"Pharmacists, any suggestions about how to manage my narcotic prescriptions?","Dear Pharmacists of Reddit:
I hope that it is ok to post on this subreddit. I am a scientist myself and when I need my scientific questions answered, I like to ask my questions directly as possible to the right group of people. I am wondering if you have any suggestions about how to better manage my monthly narcotic prescription, as it has become increasingly difficult to fill my prescriptions in my city. These are pharmacist specific questions.

Short background: Excruciating pain that has been relentless for 6 years. Taking even one step is a chore. I will probably be confined to a wheelchair soon. Genetic disease. No treatments, no cure, will progress. Countless tests, medical procedures, medication trials, etc. From the outside I look happy and healthy. I am a happy and optimistic person, but unfortunately not healthy. I am a young female scientist at a prestigious university and my outward appearance is organized and put together. 

Prescription info: I am up to oxycodone 10mg QD. I am happy that I am not on a higher dose and that my tolerance isn't higher, as those with the same medication as me are on ""cocktails"" and much much higher doses. This is the only medication I take.

I live in a major city and only 2 of the 23423 pharmacies in the city carry oxycodone 10mg. This is because most of the pharmacies have been robbed. I get it, I wouldn't want to be robbed either. I fill my prescription as either of these 2 pharmacies (they are close to each other, they both know about this and always refer me to the other pharmacy when they are out of the medication) for the entire 5 years. I have had the same doc write the scripts, and come in exactly 30 days apart. I have never had any early refills or any other weird situations. I have built a relationship with the pharmacists. I know all of the staff, except for the pharm techs that are constantly moving around. Despite all of this it has become increasingly difficult to fill my prescriptions. 

It usually starts with me heading to the pharmacy after the doctors appt. The new policy has become that all pharmacies now say that don't carry it (the pharm techs that rotate frequently) and respond to me with blank stares. I remind them I have been coming there for years, they ask me to wait while they check my profile and talk to the pharmacist, and then they said ""ok, it's not in stock."" I ask them if it's something that they have ordered or if they can order it. They won't confirm if they will actually order it or not and tell me to stop by in person later in the week. I have no problem stopping in because I know these things can't be discussed over the phone. 


*Q: Would it be reasonable for them to tell me if they are actually going to place it on the order? 

*Q: What's the quickest that the drug can arrive?

*Q: The techs always give the same response (we might order it, stop by later in the week or next week). Would it be useful to talk to the pharmacist? 

*Q: The medication has been in stock maybe only a handful of times over the past 5 years. Any way to give them a heads up to see if they will order a couple days before I bring my prescription in?


Generally I am told that I can try other pharmacies of that chain or other pharmacies in general, but:


*If I walk around with a prescription to multiple pharmacies, don't I look like a drug addict? It seems super irresponsible. For example: ""I have been to pharmacy A, B, C, X, Y and Z"" but they don't have it."" Wouldn't it seem to another pharmacist like the other pharmacies are refusing me on purpose?

*If I start filling my prescriptions at different pharmacies (different chains), then it ruins the ""loyalty"" I have to my current pharmacy. I believe that the only reason they fill my current prescription is because they can see in their system that I get my prescription filled every month on the dot at the same pharmacy. 


I went to fill my new prescription a week ago and I was told that the ordering pharmacist will be out of town for the following two weeks and no one else can place orders in the meantime. I will be cutting it extremely close with my prescription running out. The other pharmacy I go to (in the same chain) said that they would try to order it but there are no promises (I appreciated that he told me that he would actually attempt to order it). This back and forth has become increasingly frustrating over the last 5 years, especially with the established relationship. It's usually about 1 week of running around each month not knowing if I will actually be able to get my prescription filled or not. 


*Is there no one else that can order in that time?

*Is there any duty to a patient with an established medical history, that goes to the same pharmacy, with the script from the same doctor, that has a good relationship with the pharmacist-- to ensure that I don't go into withdrawal because the ordering pharmacist is away or they just don't have it in stock? By ""ensure"" I simply mean put in an order. Every month it's such a gamble. It's a constant fear of my medication running out and going into withdrawal. The stress of refilling the medication makes my medical condition worse but does not outweigh the benefits I get from taking this medication. 

I really do feel that I am managing my oxycodone prescription ""the right way."" I hate how the abuse of this medication ruins it for the people with legitimate medical conditions. If you have any suggestions or if you can answer any of my questions, I would be happy to hear it. If you prefer to PM me any information, I would be grateful as well. 

I am not interested in this thread starting any narcotics debate. Just looking for some insight into my questions. I know that narcotics are a class of medications that gives pharmacists a lot of stress.

pharmacy,How do inpatient hospital pharmacies feel about giving techs weekends off?,"As someone who has worked retail for so many years and it practically being ""against the rules and expectations"" to not work on weekends, the thought of not working one is quite appealing to me. I am currently taking a technician course and am in talks with my local hospital to begin working there full-time, but my working in retail has me nervous in even mentioning such a thing. How does this field feel about someone not working weekends? I guess another question I can ask is ""Is scheduling sporadic?"" Would I have a set schedule every day and week?

I'll assume you guys may ask me if I have a legitimate reason to have weekends off so I'll just say that I'm a freelance musician and composer and I am also working on a project currently, so that's what I spend a majority of my time doing on weekends.

medicine,[UK] [advice needed] Medical consultant on-call with two F1's. No SpR or SHO's,"A relative of mine is a Respiratory physician with almost thirty years' experience in the NHS, working in a busy DGH where he has been a Consultant for 15 years. He is as dedicated and hard-working as they come, and from a clinical point of view the best doctor I have ever come across. He has constantly been developing services at his hospital since being appointed as consultant (mostly without credit) and devotes nearly all of his free time to study or preparing teaching. He also happens one of the least politically adept people I know, and has relatively little to show for his efforts beyond the title of consultant. 

This bank holiday Monday he is expected to be on-call in the daytime with just two F1's. No registrars or senior house officers have been allocated to fill in the gaps in the rota. My relative has expressed his concerns to the Medical Director and management, who said that nothing can be done and that he would have to do the work of the registrars and SHO's who would have been there otherwise himself. When he pleaded for locum cover to be arranged he was told it wouldn't be possible (Lord only knows why). Then when he suggested that blue-light ambulances be diverted to other hospitals, in view of the lack of staff, this was denied. 

My relative, who happens to be somewhat lacking in backbone, seems resigned to working like this on Monday. Regardless of the fact that he is being treated with less respect than a dog, I am utterly appalled by how unsafe this is. The risk of having this few staff covering the medical admissions and all inpatients in a busy hospital seems unacceptable in itself, let alone the fact that not one of them is ALS certified (ALS is not mandatory until F2, and revalidation not mandatory for the consultant); not to mention the fact that it is likely either one or both of these F1's first on-call shifts as a doctor, EVER. 

While I am absolutely terrified for anyone who finds themselves or their loved ones in this hospital this weekend, I am very scared of the damage my relative may be doing to his career/reputation if he is the named consultant and, God forbid, preventable harm or death occurs. I have no doubt that the directors/management will not hesitate to make him a scapegoat. Even otherwise, their support may not make much difference to the outcome for my relative, and will absolutely not make any difference to the unfortunate patient who is affected.

[b]Please[/b]would anyone with any insight at all into these matters offer some advice as to what to do?

However in addition to outpatient work I work on discharged patients and have been told I will be trained in the inpatient setting starting this fall. Since the position is at the Veteran's Affair hospital and regarding the patient population (vets only) and requirement that all prescriptions come from the internal system (no non-VA prescribers/VA insurance), my question is would this be considered two competing pharmacies?

pharmacy,Non-pharmacist query: cutting pills *precisely*,"(I don't think this is medical advice, and my guess is that it's not the type of question the warning is supposed to exclude...though it may be similar enough that you want to delete it...)  

My wife is extremely sensitive to the dosage of a certain medicine. (She's been having terrible, difficult-to-identify-and-cure health problems for quite awhile, but the current best-guess is an unusual type of epilepsy; the meds are for that.)  Through trial-and-error, she finally has a good idea what she thinks the dose should be (in consultation with her doctor, of course...)...but the pills don't come in that dosage. All *our* attempts to cut the pills with sufficient precision have failed, and the approximations aren't good enough. (The pills are already very small, and their composition seems to make them difficult to cut precisely.)   

I thought: *hey, this is clearly something a good pharmacy should be able to handle...I'll bet they get this problem all the time*...   No luck. Every pharmacist we've talked to in our town has told us that they don't do anything of that kind. ""Get a pill-splitter,"" they say...as if we hadn't already told them that we'd tried this a bazillion times...  

*Surely* this isn't hopeless...right? *Somebody* must do stuff like this?  

Any thoughts from the professionals?  (Our next planned stop is the university chemistry department...)  

[Several of you asked for the name of the medication--the one at issue currently is Lexapro--so, not one of the anticonvulsants now, but an antidepressant (obviously) aimed at counteracting either another effect of the epilepsy, or a side-effect of the anticonvulsants (nobody's sure what the cause really is even the docs). She's had the same issue with the anticonvulsants, but currently that seems to be taken care of. Turns out that generic Lexapro (note: she's already on a generic) *is* available in liquid form. She's most of the way through trying to adjust to the higher dose of Lexapro (which she went up to in order to avoid the pill-splitting problem), so she's going to complete the alleged adjustment period. But, if she doesn't adjust to the higher dose properly, she's going to get the liquid form and try dropping back down the to previous dose--that is, the dose she had arrived at by trial-and-error, but which wasn't working out well because of the pill-splitting problem.

medicine,Why aren't bags of normal saline a unique color? So many medical errors could be eliminated!,"My wife described for me a recent medical error made by a colleague that landed that person in very hot water! The person administered the wrong fluid when normal saline was ordered and bad things happened because of it!

That got me thinking. Normal saline is given to somewhere north of 70% of patients receiving IV fluids (I'm not a medical guy, don't quote me!). Why isn't such a prevalent medicine identified by a color code? So many errors would be eliminated. Say you typed an order for NS wrong; if you saw a clear bag you'd know immediately that the patient isn't receiving NS and you should fix the order. Say you grabbed the wrong bag when going to administer NS; that would be easy to spot without thinking twice.

My wife dismissed my idea initially because they are supposed to scan everything with barcode scanners and she said it wouldn't happen to her because she scans all fluids. But obviously this doesn't work 100% of the time otherwise we wouldn't have been talking about it. A little dye in the plastic bags containing NS would make visual inspection obvious to all doctors, nurses, and techs!

pharmacy,Recent problem with blood/gore,"Im a P1 student and i have a little problem with blood that started a few months ago. My smaller brother got jumped and had his nose broken so i went with him to the ER. It was late at night and we were there for a long time and while the doctor was realigning his nose with a dull knife, he was in pain and blood rushed from his nose. Now, i have never in my life been scared of blood or anything gore. I have seen blood thousands of times with no effect. But that night when i saw blood come out of his nose, i felt lightheaded and then fainted.

Then last month I went to the doctors to get my blood work/immunizations for pharmacy school. While the nurse was drawing blood from my arm, I decided to see if i could look at my blood without fainting....I immediately felt lightheaded after 10 seconds and fainted.

I went from not being affected at all by blood/gore to being a bitch when i see blood and faint. I even feel weird now when i see it on TV and try to not look.

I'm in pharmacy school and i know that pharmacy is headed towards more patient care which means i will be seeing a lot of blood in my future. I dont know how to overcome this problem. I would appreciate any advice or help.",10.0,6,2014-08-29,PHARMA,0.04773508012294769,0.9132952690124512,0.03896962106227875

pharmacy,Arlington Doctor Accused of Running Oxycodone Ring,"A 45-year-old Arlington doctor is accused of running an Oxycodone ring by writing, filling and selling fraudulent prescriptions in Virginia and beyond. 

According to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Virginia, Dr. Derron McRae Simon of Midlothian and five other individuals are accused of conspiracy to distribute and dispense controlled substances, and possessing with intent to distribute.

Simon is also facing three counts of distributing a controlled substance to persons under 21 and aggravated identity theft.

Simon, who was the primary or only doctor at WithinMe MD in Arlington, would write hundreds of fradulent prescriptions of Oxycodone and other drugs, allegedly aware the drugs would be misused, distributed or re-sold.

According to documents, Simon would ask his assistant, 23-year-old Ereida Escobar ti create fake patient history forms and medical records to make it seem as though the prescriptions were legitimate. 
Simon and his co-defendants, including Escobar, are accused of distributing more than 11,000 Oxycodone pills valued at approximately $735,000. Documents say Simon and Escobar would receive between $500 and $1,000 for each fake prescription.
If convicted, Simon could spend up to 20 years in prison with a $1 million fine.

I still pay the same copay but does the pharmacy hurt at all?  I ask because my local pharmacy said they couldn't get the 90 pills so I went to cvs and they had no problem with it.

pharmacy,What is your pharmacy doing to accommodate the imminent work flow changes that comes with rescheduling hydrocodone?,"My pharmacy (hospital, with both an inpatient and outpatient side which share one narc station) is currently trying to think of ways to make this change less of a burden. But with how much hydrocodone we use, it will be hard to not see a serious burden of time placed on shifts. 

Are you guys changing anything? Someone jokingly asked for two narc vaults, but our boss didn't touch the suggestion. Is this illegal?  Complicated?

 Do you have a set person to do narc scripts? 

We have a lot of surgical discharges who get some combination of non controlled meds and controls. Typically you do all of the scripts for your patient to reduce confusion. I'm afraid setting up one person as our narc person might be difficult.

Currently debating on whether to do residency away (like the other side of the country) with plans to come back or do residency in the area I would like to set up my practice. The reason for going away would be to have a new experience as I have lived in the same general area for most of my life. The place I would like to set up practice is a semi-rural area with a relatively new Family Medicine program.
