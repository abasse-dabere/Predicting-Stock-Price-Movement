Health,"So what's with phytic acid?  Do I really need to soak my seeds, oats, barely, etc overnight?","Hey, I've been revamping my diet for the past month or so, and have come across conflicting information concerning phytic acid.  Essentially phytic acid, which is found in many cereals and grains, binds to minerals and vitamins in the lower intestinal tract.  This keeps these vitamins and minerals from being absorbed, which is a problem.

I understand the theory, but I have yet to see any solid evidence why I should avoid or soak foods containing phytic acid.  Soaking seeds, oats, or whatever in acidic water (ie lime or lemon juice) seems to reduce the amount of phytic acid, but is it worth the effort?

Here are two conflicting points of view:

I used to constantly wear a sweatshirt to hide my wet underarms, which only made matters worse.  Finally after a friends recommendation, I switched from Antiperspirant to just plain old-spice deodorant.  A month later and I'm as dry as a bone!  I can't believe how much time and money I wasted trying to find a cure, when it was just the astringents I was putting in my arm pits that was causing the problem the whole time.

Health,Nystagmus - Do you have any information at all?,"So my grandmother was recently diagnosed with a form of nystagmus, involuntary nystagmus I believe it's called. It's a disease of some sorts which affects eye movement so that she basically can't focus on anything and her otherwise good vision is useless. This is driving her crazy and physically drains her. It's so bad that she's more or less lying in bed all day.

She began showing symptoms approximately 2 years ago and it's been gradually worsening.

Only recently have doctors diagnosed her with this disease, while trying out many various medications which never fully work. They've admitted that they have little idea what to do.

Does anyone at all recognize this, have any information or anything at all? We live in Iceland, where we don't have many experts, especially in regards to this disease, therefore I'm forced to seek help from the internet.

I don't know if it's relevant or not, but she also has another annoying problem, maybe it's related to this, maybe not. Around 20 years ago, she started hearing this buzzing noise nonstop, kinda like being close to a waterfall. Only way to ignore it for her is to turn up the volume on the radio, so she can focus on some noise. Like I said, maybe it's relevant, maybe not.

Am I the only one?,"I haven't taken any anti-depressants after this. Even though it's hard for me to convey the exact impact taking this drug has had on my subjective experience of the world and my personality, I experienced it making me less shy, but also very much out of touch with my sense of ethics and morality, for a while making me much more of an asshole than usually. I thought I had it bad when I discussed my situation with a psychiatrist after gettting fired, dumped, losing my apaprtment, my dad getting sick and a whole lot of other shit happening. He prescribed me Efexor, but I wish to this day I had the confidence to believe it was only a passing thing. The effects of the drug on me appear to be permanent. I feel mentally raped by this drug, feels as though it removed my ability to visualize things and made me much more introverted.

Personal accounts from [scholars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2YqVLARZOM&amp;feature=related) are quite common about the difference between mono and stereo vision. I see in mono.

* Do you see in stereo vision? A simple test can be done by getting a string and putting something on the end (like a ball) and holding it out a couple feet in front of you. Focus on the ball and if you see two distinct strings then you have stereo vision. I only see one string. 

* What is it like to see in stereo? Are your aware of your ability to 'perceive' space?

Health,Does anyone wake up to a dawn simulator?,"...or anything that functions in a similar way. The principle is that the morning sunrise is clinically proven to help people wake up, and has antidepressant effects. This is pretty easy to verify if you'd ever waken up with the sun shining in your face versus on a cloudy day (which is a majority of the days around here), at least for me. The dawn simulators on Amazon are expensive, and they're anywhere from $100-$200, depending on quality. 

The concept is pretty simple, having a full spectrum light and a dimming timer that goes from off to full on over a period of half an hour. Does anyone know of a program that would suffice for this purpose? (I'm don't know enough about programming to code it myself) Instead of buying one of these at a high price, here is a list of supplies that would work equally well presuming that you already have a computer (given that you're reading this electronically).

* Lamp - Thrift store - $5
* Full spectrum light bulb - Hardware store - $2
* Cable that adapts USB to a wall outlet switch - Not sure if these are even sold - $10-$20
* Dimming program - OSS/Proprietary - $0-$30 

Budget for the above components is $17-$57, and it would be more customizable, and adaptable to fit individual needs. If anyone has experience with something like this, please feel free to share.


**EDIT:** Some alternates suggested in the comments were:

* Arduino microcontroller to control the lamp.
* Homedics SoundSpa dawn simulator which controls the lamp wirelessly.
* Philips Wake-Up Light
* Hammacher Schlemmer Peaceful Progression Wake Up Clock
