pharmacy,Hospital pharmacy getting blamed for billing issues,"I graduated last May and I’m the only pharmacist at a critical access hospital.  This is a random issue but I’m just curious if other pharmacists deal with similar issues.  I did not see this as a student but maybe it happens at other hospitals too. 

The manager of Medical Records does chart reviews and she always finds instances where the nurses pull a Med but never chart giving it.  (So the med got charged to the patient and seemingly not given).  She ALWAYS comes after me and my tech, asking us why this happened.  We literally see exactly what she sees on the computer program.  It’s always the same answer- the nurse forgot to chart it.  We try to help her but I just don’t have the time to chase after all these charges.  FYI our hospital doesn’t have scanners- nurses just pull meds and give to patients.

The Business Office comes after us about 5 times a day with similar problems.  All the time, our nurses pull meds on the wrong patient name or wrong visit number.  Here is some background: Our computer program is on the verge of permanently crashing and one of its issues is that it repopulates patient’s old visit numbers on our dispensing machine.  (Also our Dispensing machines have not been supported for a year and not getting updates).  We have done everything possible to train the nurses to pull on the correct visit number (largest number) but it still happens all the time, and when they pull on an old number, we don’t get paid- it’s physically impossible to track all of the transactions.  We have opened numerous tickets with both our EHR and dispensing machine companies, we have done everything they say to do, but the problem is still there!!!  And more problems are coming up every day.  It’s very frustrating but there seems to be no solution.  We are getting a new EHR this fall.  I was told my hospital won’t pay for updates on our EHR.

The business office has also been after us lately about the units (mL, mg, etc) get converted over to Unit on the billing interface.  This is screwing up charges.  We literally have NOTHING to do with this, yet they have been convinced that it’s something we are doing wrong.  After weeks of telling them we aren’t doing anything differently and it must be a computer glitch, they have finally opened up tickets with the EHR, but I’m sure it won’t get fixed either.

Sorry for the long post, just want to see if other hospital pharmacists have similar issues. We have a lot of problems here.",30,15,2018-04-01,PHARMA,0.24572327733039856,0.7270795106887817,0.02719721756875515

I know that in many countries (Japan, for example) there are no outpatient primary care providers. One just goes directly to a specialist of the body system which is bothersome. In most of the developing world, a person only goes to see a doctor when something is so wrong that it can't be borne anymore. Isn't this *de facto* what the US is coming to have too? Will urgent care be the new primary care?

Edit: A few more details. Looking back on residency, I see now that the vast majority of my attendings were workaholics and bitterly unhappy, in their attempts to be all things to all people. I was regarded poorly by them for having the nerve to point out the elephant in the room that what they'd taken on for a workload was beyond what any sane and caring person should ever be asked to take on.

I was wondering how would you guys handle an upset or irate patient/customer that whips out their phone and begins to record themselves arguing with you at the pharmacy counter?

I’m going to consult our company policy later, but I thought I would ask here first.

Company policy aside, is it considered a HIPAA violation for them to even record *near* the pharmacy? Yet alone for them to directly point a phone or device that records **into** it?

Call me paranoid, but I’m always afraid I’m gonna come across the wrong person that has to make a huge scene by recording you and themselves berating you—usually for something out of your control/not your fault.
Similar to the customer freakout videos you see all the time....

Hi everybody,

We will be hosting our first /r/pharmacy AMA on Thursday,  April 12, 2018 from 2:00-3:30 EST.

Leah Christl, Ph.D., Director of the Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars Staff at FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, will be answering your questions regarding biosimilars: development and approval process, product labeling, and more.

They will post Monday to give people time to ask questions ahead of time, but we encourage as many of you as possible to try to join in the conversation live. I will replace this post with their's as soon as it is ready,  so start thinking about your questions!

pharmacy,I'm Leah Christl—Director of the Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars Staff at FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Let's talk about biosimilars. AMA!,"Hello reddit! I’m Leah Christl, and I am the Director of the Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars Staff at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s Office of New Drugs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Therapeutic Biologics and Biosimilars Staff, also known as TBBS, is responsible for ensuring consistency in the scientific and regulatory approach and advice to sponsors regarding development programs for proposed biosimilar products and related issues regarding development programs for therapeutic biologics. 
 
Prior to joining the FDA, I received my Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology and Pathobiology – Marine Biomedicine and Environmental Science from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. I also spent 2 years at the University of South Carolina as an Associate Research Professor. Outside of my work at FDA, I spend time traveling with my husband and training with our beloved rescued dogs.   
 
Congress, through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCI Act) of 2009, created an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved biological product.
 
Biological products are the fastest-growing class of therapeutic products in the United States. When patients are prescribed a biological product, biosimilar and interchangeable products can offer additional treatment options, potentially lowering health care costs.
 
I will be answering questions about biosimilar and interchangeable products, the development and approval process for these products, labeling and more starting at 2 p.m. ET (11 a.m. PT) on Thursday, April 12th. Ask Me Anything!
 
EDIT 1: Hi all, thank you for all of your thoughtful questions about biosimilars. I'm happy you could join me, and I'm excited for FDA’s first AMA! Now, let’s get started…

medicine,Lifestyle in hospice medicine,"My family medicine practice is very broad, but lately, I find myself drawn toward hospice cases more than other kinds of cases. It is difficult to explain why, but I find the work more satisfying. I have been approached by a hospice about coming on with them. The pay is comparable to my current job. It seems to be less pressurized than a high volume primary care environment.

Like many specialties, primary care is becoming more and more oppressed under the burden of ""quality measures."" The patients often make my nurses cry, and the insurances are increasingly dictating patient care. The volume is soul-crushing. What are the hidden downsides to hospice medicine I might not see from the primary care side of the fence?

medicine,Help me help a pre-med who is going to get an unpleasant wake up call.,"Hello /r/medicine , long story short - one of my mutual friends is a premed student that **REALLY** needs to be knocked down a few pegs. She is rude, talks disparagingly about nurses (they're just the shit wipers after all), and has a lot of confidence in skills that she doesn't have.

I could go on for days about this but I wont. Anyways, this may be a long shot - MD's, RN's, anyone and everyone - are there any inspiring books that you've read that will get the message across of ""stay humble"" and ""don't be a dick"" related to healthcare?

I know she's just cocky and a dick but I don't think she understands overall how that attitude is not going to fly. I cringe at the thought of her speaking to people in the profession with her attitude. She's immature and for some reason I don't want her to get eaten alive.

I hope what I'm asking for makes sense. Thanks!

medicine,Benadryl Overdose Antidote Storytime,"I work as a paramedic in an ER of a medium sized hospital in a county in the northeast. Had a kid OD on.. something, we just didn't know what. Family states he came home and was acting weird and became aggressive. He came in by EMS and was agitated and hallucinating, but not really aggressive. Tachycardic, but otherwise normotensive and good airway. 2 of Ativan only made it worse. His speech was slurred and incomprehensible. He could barely stand, but he put up a good struggle when we got him back in bed. We ended up having to hold him down and ultimately restrain him because he kept trying to get out of bed or pull his Foley out (he was retaining, then lost continence), then raised a fist at a couple of us. It took a while to figure out what was going on. He wouldn't sit still long enough for imaging, and sedatives weren't working. He was getting close to buying a tube. After a bit of consults, Doc explained it was an anticholinergic overdose. ""Mad as a hatter, Hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone"". The kid had it all. Doc ordered the reversal agent, physostigmine, which he hadn't given in 10 years, he said. Charge nurse of 25 years said she has only seen it once. I was fascinated. It was to be given over 5 mins and I watched the monitor the entire time. Heart rate started dropping slowly from 115 and eventually evened out at 98. At about 4:30, he sat straight up in bed and started talking normal and was lucid. Hole-lee shit.


Sorry, y'all. I really enjoy learning about stuff like that and wanted to share it with you. Apparently this doesn't happen very often and I was excited to learn. The kid ended up being completely fine after a couple hours and relocated the next morning. He admitted taking a large quantity of benadryl.

medicine,Leaving AMA with central venous access,"If a patient wants to leave against medical advice while they have a line providing central venous access, what can you do to address this situation? Obviously, you have to discuss the risks of leaving with the line in place with the patient, address their reasons for wanting to leave and assess their capacity. But what should you do if they have capacity, still desire to leave and also do not consent to removal of the line? Does the situation become more complicated if the patient is a known drug abuser and in all likelihood will use the line to inject narcotics? What if they're actively bacteremic and/or septic and acutely need life saving interventions?

I feel like the scenario is ethically complicated because we respect capacitated patients' abilities to make decisions, even if they are bad decisions. Patients also need to provide consent for procedures like line removal for ethical and practical reasons. However, the line is a source of iatrogenic complications. Somebody placed the line to help the patient, but without the patient's cooperation, the line represents a danger. 

I could imagine an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure in this scenario; considering risks, benefits and patient selection before placing a line is important. But as an intern, these sorts of things come up as an urgent page from nursing at 1 am while night crosscovering a different team which placed the line.

medicine,Parental Refusal of Life-Saving Treatments,"So my GF is currently studying for step and came across an ethics question where I think the provided answer was wrong. It was about a 16 year old mother refusing intubation for her septic newborn. My understanding (in the US at least) was always that if the parent of a child is present or able to be contacted, they have the full right to make decisions, including refusing potentially life-saving treatments such as airway management and blood transfusions. I found this [link](https://depts.washington.edu/bioethx/topics/parent.html) which seems to support that view. I understand that you can get the hospital ethics committee on board, and if time permits you can work with Child Protective Services or the court system to get an injunction and treat the kid. However, the Q bank suggests that you should just tube the kid. 

Beyond whether the question bank is right or wrong, I'm curious if anyone has encountered this situation in their practice or knows of state-specific laws or cases that could shed some more light on this. Practicing EM, and in an area with a somewhat substantial population of Jehovah's Witnesses, I feel like I could encounter this situation at some point in my training or career and want to feel prepared when I do.",93,183,2018-04-08,PHARMA,0.022979259490966797,0.9180191159248352,0.059001680463552475

I did it because my parents highly recommended it when I was in high school. It also offered a 6 figure salary 6 years out of high school, anywhere in the country. Very few, if any, degrees offered that. (Feel free to list other ones that do in the comments) I also knew I was smart enough to do it.

medicine,I Can Take Care of This At Home...,"So I've seen a number of wild ""This seemed like a good idea"" treatments that patients have done at home in lieu of professional help. Usually it's due to cost, but I've got a particularly poignant example.

This wasn't my patient, but he had an interesting case and naturally word got around about it. The gentleman had hemochromatosis and required his bloodletting treatments, buuuut insurance didn't cover it, so he decided to rig up his own apparatus at home. The guy actually did a hell of a job- he was taking testosterone and was able to get sterile needles to use, IV tubing, mason jars to collect the blood... and a shop vac to provide suction.

A few weeks went by and no issues at all with his bloodletting. He let the appropriate amount, kept the supplies sterile, disposed of the blood properly, and was pretty much completely on top of it. However, one day, he wasn't being particularly mindful of the switch on the shop vac and flipped it into reverse- *to blow.* Luckily the guy saw his mistake and turned it off within a few seconds, but he still had an air embolism and honestly it's a miracle he survived, especially being that he was at home alone in his garage when he stroked out.

His GP was mainly appalled (or at least to his face), but later said ""That's ingenious, but what an idiot."" The dude got his treatments covered and goes to a proper facility now last I heard.

Anybody else got any ""What the hell possessed you to do that"" at-home treatments?

Edit: To make this story *even crazier,* I followed up on his case and found some details that I seem to have actually underplayed.

pharmacy,Rank prescribers by quality of voicemail Rxs,"Last night had a voicemail that I had to listen to like 5 times to catch everything b/c the prescriber sounded like she was driving through a tunnel on her cellphone, speaking on fast-forward and mumbling. Good times. 

Mathematical relationship is:

*Quality of VM ∝ Probability of speaking with person calling in VM should I need to call*

**From best to worst**(in general ofc, there are always outliers one way or the other):

* **Gold: RNs** - these guys know that if they leave a shitty VM that is missing info, they're getting a phone call that wastes my time and theirs.

* **Silver/Bronze: PAs and NPs** - Same deal as RNs, but less accessible. At least more accessible than docs, but they occasionally forget certain things like #refills or qty. PAs (in my state of CO) please remember your supervising doc for controls.

* **Wooden Spoon: MDs** - To preface, I adore those docs that take the time (I know they are busy; I have a doc dad and sister) to address my concerns when they arise. But I swear to fucking god, if there's VM that is missing quantity, refills, speaking a mile a minute, mumbling, somehow magically have poor reception that cuts out *exactly* at the minute they say the phone number (IF they give a phone number that is), 9 times out of 10 it's a doc that left the message.

Docs, I love what you do and much respect for all you carry on your shoulders, but please for the love of god when you call in scripts make it clear, concise, and complete. Make sure reception is good, not ""I'm calling this in from an underground bunker"" quality. Having to decipher a script between mumbling and speed-talking is not super fun either. Here's a wishlist of thingies:

* phone number for your office [cell is nice and hats off to the docs dedicated enough to answer my q's off the clock; I have talked to some amazing docs on weekends that took the time to answer my call and would love to buy them a coffee]
* Quantity/refills would be nice
* DEA for controls; NPI/DEA is a ""nice to have"" for me personally on non-controls
* No, you cannot call-in a C2 (I had a PA ask me this)... errrr, well, you *could*, but I don't think you'd want to deal with the hassle of doing a phone 72h C2, trust me, I've done them ;)
* Directions... frequency; ""PRN"" by itself is... inadequate. Does that mean q12h? q1h??? Common sense is fine and I can usually bet on what the dose should be, but insurance audits and SBOP inspections might derail this gravy train.
* Diagnosis code for androgens (i.e., e29.1? f64.0?). The completionist in me wants Dx codes for DM strips and asthma stuff as well even though we can pretty much bet the bank on what it is.

I'm sure I'm forgetting something but I gotta run for now. Not hating on docs at all, but ARGH it's frustrating when a VM needs a phone call and it's often when the provider calls it in themselves.",41,57,2018-04-10,PHARMA,0.07634345442056656,0.8991647362709045,0.024491792544722557

medicine,Dealing with arrogance colleagues in medical training,"I am a cardiology fellow (finishing this year) and I am noticing that I have a really hard time dealing with arrogant other doctors, particularly juniors. I have described a specific situation below:

There's an intern (who is matched to cardio already, yay for me...) who is  disrespectful, loud, and arrogant. He interrupts others constantly, speaks with the utmost confidence even when he is wrong, and doesn't take feedback. During multiple attempts to give him feedback, he will smirk, interrupt, and argue that he is actually in the right. His program director is aware of the issue and has discussed it with him, but no improvement yet. 

I am looking for peoples' thoughts on two things:

1. What are some strategies to prevent his arrogance from affecting the team dynamic?
2. I feel like this kind of issue bothers me more than it should - how can I stop letting it bother me? I am worried about the patients he will harm and the med students he will model these bad behaviours to.",44,48,2018-04-12,PHARMA,0.2033952921628952,0.7708772420883179,0.025727512314915657
medicine,Jehovah Witness and Blood Tranfusion,"I have been taking care of a recently released inmate who has ESRD and now metastatic prostate cancer. His epogen hasn’t started working and he needs a blood transfusion. He doesn’t align with the JW doctrine but feels beholden to his wife who has stood by him for 40 years of confinement.
We have tried to secretly set up (with his consent) a way to get him the transfusion but a “miraculous” hemoglobin uptick would be suspicious to his family and further community. 
If he receives the transfusion he would be ostracized by his family, kicked out and die alone on the streets in his wheelchair or back in prison where his parole officer would send him. 
It was a sad day to shake his hand one last time knowing and watch him wheel out of the clinic.
It’s a sad between and rock and hard place situation as his desire for community and family outweighs the benefit of a simple life-prolonging treatment. I hope “we” can move forward from this someday and I felt this may be an okay place to download my feelings regarding this circumstance. Has anyone run into this before? 

**edit: this patient’s impending mortality snuck up on him over the weekend and he managed to get two secret transfusions.

medicine,"""My acupuncturist told me I have a lung chlamydia or mycoplasma, just give me my antibiotics""","*Some details have been changed so there is no way this could be linked to any real patient*

The situation happened some time back, I was helping out a GP, he had appointments in another room. He trusted me quite much, I usually saw patients by myself and asked for his help when I didn't know what to do.

So, there's a lady put into my appointment, GP had assigned an hour of appointment time with her. Oh well, nothing weird, happened all the time, usually with patients with lots of medication and comorbidities. Didn't ring any bells before the appointment. No previous information was also available about that patient, but that wasn't that uncommon either.

I called the patient in, asked what the problem was. Conversation was as follows:

Lady: I came from my acupuncturist, I have been coughing, they told me I have lung chlamydia or mycoplasma and I need antibiotics.

Me: Oh, alright, so we need to evaluate your condition for sure. How long have you been coughing.

Lady: About a year now.

I proceeded to take a detailed history and physical examination. Nothing too interesting. No history of fever, illnesses, only that cough got worse when she was lying down. I noticed though, that jugular veins on the neck were visible when she was standing up.

Me: ""So, we need to take an X-ray now and after that, some blood analyses""

Lady: ""No no no, I just want to take the antibiotics so I can get rid of my cough. I don't want an X ray or blood analyses.""

Me (internally 0.0): We can't prescribe you antibiotics when we are not sure that you really have that problem.

Lady: But my acupuncturist told me I have this! Also I'm so fed up with that cough, I want to start antibiotics today.


I spent the whole hour talking with her about the need of an X ray, and guess what: she did have one finally!

On the X ray there was a widened mediastinum, so she was promptly sent to CT (struma and some mass at right lung), and lung biopsy - she had tuberculosis!


Tl;dr - a patient demanded antibiotics for atypical pneumonia, I refused to write any without an X ray, via X ray it was possible to find out she had tuberculosis.

pharmacy,[update] I failed my very last rotation before graduation. Just an update,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/8d8ffz/i_failed_my_very_last_rotation_before_rotation_i/?st=JG8BZ3HV&amp;sh=8eab8267

So far I have contacted my APPE Director and the Dean. I was informed by my classmates that I am not the first person this preceptor failed. In fact, she has a history of failing students. 

When I reach out to these students for advice, there is an absolute trend: this preceptor is not a good educator. And she only ever treats you well if she likes you. Within 1 week of being on rotation, she has made up her mind about failing you or passing you. No one knows if she does any of this intentionally, because she appears “nice” on the outside. She likes to bring up negatives things about the people she doesn’t like and base on those incidents to fail her. She never takes note on the positive things the students did. Even the other students on the rotation with me said “why is she so opinionated against you”. She saw the bias, not just me. It makes me feel better because it just confirms that I wasn’t crazy. 

Talking about the preceptor. I had a talk with her about why I failed, despite working long hours and putting in dedications. After the mid point eval where she said I needed improvement, I had worked 5-6 hours extra daily (even the APPE Director was surprised when I said I came in at 5am every day to get ready for rounds). She said she could see my dedication, and that I have improved since, and that I am “not a terrible pharmacist” - but nonetheless I am “not ready”. Take it how you will.  

This is regardless of what I explained to her that I have different skill sets that can be applied to the fields I want to go into (retail, industry), just not for clinical. For example, she wanted to switch a patient from xarelto to warfarin because the copay for xarelto was high... I signed the patient up for a coupon, and he went home with $10 a month copay on xarelto. In fact, when I gave my preceptor the coupon card, she didn’t know what to do with it. She didn’t know if she should call the manufacture or send this card somewhere. She’s a clinical pharmacists, she knows her clinical things and kinda nothing else I think. To her, everyone should be clinically adequate. So she HAD to fail me. Even when it means I won’t be able to graduate in May, and I will have to drop the job offer that I had (not a clinical job) since I can’t relocate in time. Regardless of all of that, I am just, as she said, “not ready” 

So a few options were laid out for me by the director. The best option right now for me is: since I have 2 weeks left before graduation, he will set me up for a “rotation” at another site with another preceptor - but in the same disciplinary. And then depending on my evaluation from this second preceptor, he may decide on reversing my grades. I was an A-B student throughout pharmacy school. GPA 3.6 - not fantastic, but I don’t think it’s terrible?  I believe I will be able to pass this next two weeks.

medicine,Staying safe around violent patients,"Hey everyone,

There was a post on r/medicalschool today (link below) about a med student being left in a room with a patient flashing his gun. 

This got me thinking about the general topic of safety in medicine. I matched into psychiatry and have picked up some tips (be the one closest to the door) but I’d love advice from experienced people in healthcare about safety, particularly with agitated patients.

medicine,Do you have a favorite physical exam finding?,"Do you have a favorite physical exam finding? Not a most useful, or most evidence-based, but the one that you just love for some inexplicable reason.


My favorite has to be [Beau’s lines](http://amjmed.org/optimal-systolic-blood-pressure-target-after-sprint-insights-from-a-network-meta-analysis-of-randomized-trials/) -- these are transverse ridges on the fingernails that are associated with MI, sepsis, chemotherapy -- really any major stressor to the body.  They were first described by [Joseph Honoré Simon Beau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Honor%C3%A9_Simon_Beau) in 1846 from his work on patients with cardiac disease (fun fact -- apparently Beau’s syndrome is also named after him, and I’d know more if I could read French, but Beau’s syndrome appears to be what we’d today call “asystole”). It’s related to Mee’s lines (white lines in the nails with NO indentation, classically seen in arsenic poisoning, but these days seen commonly in chemotherapy) and Muehrcke's nails (discoloration in the vascular bed of the nail, so they disappear with pressure and don’t grow with the nail; classically associated with nephrotic syndrome and severe hypoalbuminemia -- but of course, also chemotherapy).


I love Beau’s lines not because they’re incredibly clinically useful. I couldn’t find any data on them, but even in my own experience they’re not terribly sensitive, and they never tell you anything that the patient wouldn’t just tell you. The reason I love them is because nails grow at a pretty predictable rate -- about a millimeter a week. So when you ask your patient what happened four weeks ago, they think you’re some kind of wizard.


The best example that I ever saw was on a friend of mine who did wilderness trips -- two weeks in the high desert, followed by a week in civilization. They asked me what was going on with their fingernails -- and had the finest set of Beau’s lines I had ever seen. Naturally I didn’t take a picture.


Final reason I love them: Otzi the Iceman, the oldest mummy ever discovered, [also had Beau’s lines on exam](http://bedside-rounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/otzi-beaus.jpg), which has led researchers to assume he suffered repeated bouts of trauma 8, 13, and 16 weeks before death. [I even did a podcast about it](http://bedside-rounds.org/episode-17-the-iceman/).

I worked as an intern before and am very familiar with the computer system but have a lot of anxiety at work, I'm assuming due to fear of making a mistake. When I do final checks on prescriptions I worry about a wrong patient getting the wrong script and it causes me to check the name over and over sometimes. I have noticed this problem a while back and have been trying to force myself to only look once and move on, but have not been successful. Is there anyone who has had a similar hard time, and if so what worked for you to improve on your speeds? I feel like I'm in a downward spiral as I work at different stores around the district and I feel I already have a bad reputation as a slow pharmacist, in addition to the already negative attitude that usually comes with me not being a stores regular pharmacist and this feeling that I'm already unwanted makes me more anxious and tends to make me second guess more.

medicine,"""Well what are you going to do if the patient sues you??""","I hear this response very often when attendings order labs/imaging that have no clinical indication and zero evidence to back up the order other than ""what are you gonna say if you're standing in front of the judge??"". It seems like cover your ass (CYA) medicine at its finest, but here's my question:

If you are managing a patient per 'standard of care' guidelines and your treatment is evidence based, wouldn't it be extremely difficult to be found guilty of malpractice so long as you could defend your management with sound evidence and reasoning? It seems like a lot of healthcare dollars are being wasted by ordering ""routine"" or ""CYA"" labs. 

What does /r/medicine think about this practice and how do the residents and attendings here let this impact their practice?

edit to clarify: I understand that there are reasons to order tests even though evidence doesn't completely support it. What I really would like to know: Is ""I'm ordering this for no reason other than because I'm scared of getting sued"" a legitimate reason to order an unnecessary test?

medicine,Advice on dealing with malingering patients? (And their parents...long post warning my apologies),"I had a 7 y.o black female today present for an eye examination. Had a trauma to her right eye about 2-3 months ago (another child had hit her at after school care with some sort of ball). 

The patient complains of a dull pain and severely reduced vision in that eye ever since. Mother has taken her to 2 different eye doctors who told her everything was within normal limits and no deficits of any kind were noted. 

Medical history: patient was born premature at 32 weeks but without major complication. 

Ocular history: never worn glasses before and largely unremarkable with the exception being the trauma 

Family history is unremarkable 

My exam findings revealed count fingers acuity in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. 

Pupils were PERRLA with no afferent pupillary defect. 
Confrontation fields were restricted in the right eye and normal in the left. 

Refraction with cycloplegia yielded +0.25 in the right and left eyes with both eyes being corrected to 20/20 acuity. 
I had to convince my patient however the right eye was seeing through a “very strong lens”. For non eye people +0.25 is essentially no prescription. 

Anterior segment, dilated fundus examination and intraocular pressures were all normal and unremarkable. 

I explained to the mother my findings and that glasses were not indicated and that she is likely exaggerating her symptoms. The mother became slightly aggressive and stern in her tone and accused of me lying to her child by saying it was a “very strong lens”. I told the mother often times young children will exaggerate symptoms in order to seek attention or for some other emotional/psychological reason but that her daughters eyes were perfectly healthy. Mom was not happy with my explanations and told me they would seek a fourth opinion. 

Is there any way the meddit community thinks I could have handled this differently or approached talking to the mother in a different way?",135,134,2018-04-26,PHARMA,0.1110842227935791,0.8633490800857544,0.025566712021827698

pharmacy,TZDs for autism - a tale,"I am with holding information such as the specific TZD, specific age of patient, and a few details to maintain anonymity.  

I refused a prescription for a TZD in a ~7 year old patient. 

Initially I called the office and a rude receptionist picked up. I asked for the indication of the medication and her only response was immune modulation (whatever that means). I was unsure and maybe there was something I was unaware of.

I looked up for an hour any case studies, any use cases, any off label indication. I left the RX on hold because I could not get a hold of the father.

Fast forward a few days later the father comes in to pick up the RX. I ask him what his child is using it for; he seemingly has no clue, something about high insulin in his child's blood. All he knew was they took a lot of blood from her child. 

I call back the office asking for the indication and another receptionist(possibly the same one?) picks up with a lot of attitude. The receptionist is saying high insulin in the blood. I ask if the patient is diabetic. Her response was, ""NOT YET!"" I ask if I can speak to the doctor. She claims, ""He is away and if I call him, he will say exactly what I am about to tell you!!!""

""He is a practicing pediatrician for over 20 years and has been doing this for years. He is the doctor, you're the pharmacist, and you should fill the prescription!!!!""

I respond, ""I am not comfortable filling this prescription at this time, the medication has not been well studied in the pediatric patient, I am unaware of any use case outside T2DM and even then there are other options due to its risks. You are welcome to send the prescription elsewhere.""

Honestly at this point she still hasn't even given me the indication outside high insulin in the blood and after looking up the doctor online (who has a very notorious history from Google) did I find out his intention: for autism. More on this later.

The receptionist responds, ""This child has ADHD, autism, obese (??? what, I thought you're prescribing TZD!!!), but yes we will send the prescription elsewhere!!"" and hangs up.

The only study I can find was done with the prescribing MD after googling him and there is so many questionable things he says and writes. The study itself is questionable. Also this receptionist doesn't even know or understand why he uses the TZD for autism! Not that I believe it makes sense, but the study says why it works.

I spent the last hour just watching videos on his presentations and interviews and I have many opinions on the guy. I will leave my emotions out because maybe I really am missing something.

So tell me, am I missing something?!?!? I am open to the idea I am completely in the wrong. 

Thank you for reading.

pharmacy,“I’m calling the governor!”,"So today we got caught up pretty quickly on actual prescriptions during work, so I had some time to do clinical stuff.

Log into the queue and start calling patients to do adherence counseling, see if they need refills, the whole nine yards. The conversation for the first call on my list goes like this: 

Me: Hello, I’m (name) calling from (pharmacy), and I just wanted to check in with you on a couple of medications that you’re taking. Is now a good time?

Patient: My doctor does that with me, so I definitely don’t need to do that with you! 

She hangs up. Okay, pretty rude but whatever. I’ll decline the counseling and move on with my life. But wait, there’s more!

Not five minutes later she calls back and starts screaming at one of my technicians. Apparently the tech couldn’t get a word in edgewise to pass me the phone. Then hangs up immediately, again. Crazy lady said she’s reporting me to the board for ‘trying to practice medicine without a license’. I cannot even control my laughter at this point. I’m trying not to be petty and call her back going, ‘hey psycho, I heard you had some follow up questions for me, so I was just calling you back!’

So I’m continuing doing clinical things when the store management calls me. I already know what this is about. So now she’s called them and said verbatim according to the store manager, ‘I am calling the governor! She should be arrested!’ I’m cracking up at this point. Store management understands that I’m just trying to do my job.

1- What are the common jobs/titles that postdocs transition to into industry? I know I could go to Scientist in R&amp;D...but what are the other options?

2- What are the right questions to ask? I'm going to be around a lot of biotech folk at a conference soon and want to ask the smart questions! What do you wish you had asked? (And, what are the smart questions that will look insightful asking?)

3- What's the best way to convince potential employers (both in person and in resume) that I'm not the type of academic they're afraid of hiring? I keep hearing that industry doesn't like PhDs with no industry experience because they don't work well with others, can't share data/successes, don't switch projects easily, etc. 

4- Any other advice that I didn't ask for specifically! I'll take all the help I can get...

Thanks so much!!!",8,19,2018-04-29,PHARMA,0.023518508300185204,0.9240584373474121,0.05242302641272545

medicine,Residency applications/licensing with mental health history?,"Hi I have a history of a mental health d/o (an anxiety disorder), which is well controlled and has absolutely no impact on my functioning as a human or as a student. I am getting ready to apply for residency in a surgical subspecialty. 

I am wondering if I should only apply to residencies in states where I won't have to disclose this history (or states that only ask if it would IMPAIR my ability to practice medicine)? I fear that I would land a great residency spot, but then a year or so in, be unable to get a license for whatever reason. Is this a valid concern of mine? Does a list of states and the questions they ask pertaining to this exist anywhere?

It is frustrating because I have a very strong application (multiple publications, &gt;260 step 1, etc), and don't want to be limited in where I apply for residency.

Thanks!",73,75,2018-04-30,PHARMA,0.03024790622293949,0.9345968961715698,0.03515524044632912

pharmacy,Medical Writer: How to get started?,Hello Fellow RPH.  I am your typical retail pharmacist who is very dissatisfied with  my quality of life in the retail field.  I have decided that the situation is  too dire for me to stick around in retail.   I am contemplating now for a while to become a medical writer.  how do I get started in this field as I have no experience in this area.  I was thinking about getting the  AMWA essential skills certification?  Can any medical writers comment on this?

medicine,Are white boards a JCAHO violation?,"Hey folks,

I’m a resident at a hospital in NYC and I suggested that the program install an outward facing white board on our work room door. We’d use it just to jot down notes for other clinicians who are looking for us (e.g. away from desk, performing procedure, page 5-5555 if emergency). The door is in hallway near the ED, and there is quite a bit of patient traffic.

Administration was receptive to the idea but was concerned whether or not this would be a JCAHO a violation. I have no idea how to determine this. Does anyone know and able to provide a trustworthy reference? Thanks!",35,21,2018-04-30,PHARMA,0.02329469844698906,0.9235156178474426,0.053189728409051895
