- The patient starts becoming extremely violent, disorientated and incomprehensible, what would you do then?

Health,[US] My doctor revealed private medical information. Suggestions?,"I'm a divorced father and recently learned I have a common and commonly misunderstood developmental disorder. I believe I saw signs of it in my son and wished to have him tested for general learning disabilities but the ex vetoed it (""He's perfect!""). Luckily the pediatrician is a tie-breaker in the decree. 

I called her up and said that my condition was private and I wanted it to stay that way if the mother called in but that I wanted to get him tested and she was throwing a fit. I explained that it was important that my condition was not shared and that my concern for him was phrased as either a learning or developmental disorder. She agreed and agreed with getting the assessment as a precaution. 

I later received an email from the ex detailing almost the entire conversation I had with the doctor, including many details I only told the doctor, ever. 

Because this is a misunderstood disorder it's possible that if she ever decides to go to court for something that she could play on the common misunderstanding of it and try to take my son. Then I'd have to pay a specialist to provide testimony that its not as bad as people think, but now I'm out a few hundred/thousand dollars. 

What are my options, here? 

Edit: Doctor is dual-specialized in pediatrics and general aka a family doctor. She was the doctor for all of us since my son was born and remained so after the divorce.

I forwarded the email to her and she freaked out a little and called me first thing in the AM and we cleared a lot of it up. It seems she let information slip in passing (""such as ___"") instead of directly and the crazy ex managed to put pieces together from that. The doctor apologized and we talked about it and have worked out that if it does come to a court situation that she'll either write up a statement that I'm cool or have a specialist do it so that I'm covered, and promised to have a script ready next time and stick to it.

medicine,Obama(Romney)care or worse? Seeking opinions about the future of American healthcare.,"so I was watching the presidential election debates, like many i'm sure, and I started to realize that both presidents are planning to defund Medicare. I believe Romney was telling the truth about the $700bil or so Obamacare would cut from Medicare (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/03/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cut-716-billion-medicare/), and if Romney is calling for a voucher program, (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/03/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-wants-turn-medicare-voucher-prog/) that basically means a gradual withering to nothing of Medicare; so we are left with no medicare either way. Is it just a question of who pays? Or of how many Americans are covered? With Obama he wants young healthy people to pay, and with Romney I don't know who he want's to pay, the poor?

According to Wikipedia, there was a case, in Massachusetts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_health_care_reform#Fountas_v_Dormitzer) where a guy refused to buy insurance and the courts dismissed his case and refused to hear any appeals. So anyway, what do you all medditors think about the future of American healthcare?

I have a question that's been bothering me for a while about how to give career advice that is honest without being crushing.  My MS3 on service last month was a solid worker and we got to be pretty good friends, and he's interested in surgery. However when I asked him why (to work on him a bit..I myself am not in a surgical specialty ;) ) his reason floored me.  Apparently the main reason he wants to be a surgeon is because his entire life he was told that he couldn't use his hands for shit and was constantly harrassed/bullied by adults as well as his peers.  We still keep in contact and I try to mentor him when I can, but my concern is how to break the news to him that entering a specialty based solely on anger (which he has a lot of) may not be the greatest idea.  I'm sure that if he worked hard he could become a surgeon but speaking frankly, I think he would be a square peg in a round hole.  Any thoughts on what my role should be?

It's discussed on the [Wikipedia Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus_transplantation) as well. 

So far, no such transplant has been performed on a transgender woman. While obviously conception wouldn't be possible without IVF, it could certainly be worthwhile for certain folks. Anti-rejection drugs would be needed, but this doesn't seem to be a barrier for such transplants in cisgender women. Because of pelvic dimensions, delivery would need to be via C-section.

medicine,How to you ask patients to rate pain?,"When performing a pain assessment on verbal adults, 0-10 is the standard, but how do you explain what either extreme means. Too often I hear staff simply ask ""How would you rate your pain, 0-10? 0 is no pain, 10's the worst."" This inevitably results in numerous coughs, colds, and sore throats being a 10 to patients.

I've tried to avoid these false 10's by phrasing my pain assessments differently. ""0 is no pain at all, 10 is the absolute worst pain you've ever experienced in your entire life to date."", ""10 is like walking on broken glass mixed with rock salt"", ""10 is like being buried up to your chin in a fire ant mound"", etc.

I also try to avoid leading patients when asking them to describe the quality of the pain. I never ask a patient if the pain in their chest is ""crushing"" or ""like a gorilla sitting on their chest"". I always give adjectives that are quite bland. ""Can you describe the pain? Is it dull, achy, pinching?""

medicine,"Creating a mobile recommendation system for patients with thyroid disease. What are my limitations, Meddit?","I'm currently a senior computer science student, and I'm interested in creating a mobile application *recommendation system* for patients clinically diagnosed with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

**The features I am envisioning it to have are:**

* hormone laboratory values log
* symptoms log
* diet and medical recommendations based on input symptoms and history
* time-series analysis of laboratory vales and symptom frequency, for prediction/forecasting purposes

I have recently recovered from hypothyroidism which is why I had the idea to do this research. From experience, it's very hard to effectively communicate with doctors about all symptoms and difficulties encountered. I am thinking that a log and a personalized recommendation system might be useful for low-critical diseases like hypo/hyperthyroidism.

However I have insufficient background in the medical aspects of the project. I have read *Thyroid Disease in Adults* by Nyström et al so far; and, while it answered many questions, it opened up new ones as well.

**Meddit, can you please help by answering any of these?**

* What are the most appropriate references and journals for thyroid disease information and news?
* If my greatest value to offer are recommendations, where can I find the original sources of these, for citation purposes?
* Is my intention to data mine the user's data useful (or legal?), or will it just create stress? If the user's inputs multiple symptoms in a short amount of time, can I justify a recommendation to see a doctor?
* Do patients of hypothyroidism have significantly different needs from patients of hyperthyroidism, and should I limit my target scope to just one?

Health,My big toe on my right foot has been infected for 8 years and no doctor has been able to help me.  Anyone advice is much appreciated!,"In high school I played football and was a defensive tackle.  One night it was in the 40's and sleeting.  I just so happened to be up against a 300 lb offensive end who was 6'8'' and went on to play college ball.  My shoe on my right foot was wearing low on the sole and ended up splitting and I could only tape it together and finish the game.  Needless to say, my toe was exposed to terrible conditions for a few hours (including getting stepped on countless times) and has never been the same since.  

I've been to several doctors and they have prescribed anti fungal cream, pills, and a clear liquid to apply on the toe but nothing has ever fixed or even helped.  All of them swear ""this will do the trick"" but no success.  A few years ago it spread to my next toe and then my 4th toe.

pharmacy,I'm a PharmD for a major pharmacy chain who likely failed a drug test yesterday...any advice?,"EDIT #2: Okay guys, since so many of you have been asking for an update, I'm going to fill you in with the facts as I know them so far. First of all, Quest Diagnostics has NOT contacted me yet with a positive result. I took the drug test at 11:00 on October 10th. It has been well over a week since I took the test, so from everything I can gather from message boards on the internet, I should be golden. HOWEVER, my store manager usually receives an email from Quest for negative results, she has received no such email for my test. Another confusing fact is that my store manager tested positive for hydrocodone (she had a Rx). She got a phone call from a Medical Review Officer from Quest on the Monday after the UDS, and our pharmacy has already been called to verify the prescription. 

This makes me believe one of two things. One, my sample came back positive on the EMIT test, but it came back negative on the confirmatory GC/MS and for whatever reason my store manager didn't get an email (remember, this seems very unlikely because I was taking bong rips the night before the test and I am a daily smoker). Two, Quest tried to call me but had an incorrect phone number. If this was the case, I believe they would have contacted my Walgreens to get my phone number so they could have the MRO call me. 

My store manager called a former DM to ask about my situation. The ex-DM said it can take the district office up to 3 weeks to come down to fire someone. It's also apparently not unheard of for the district office to sweep incidents under the rug (for example, the pharmacist I replaced when I started working there never got fired for sleeping on the job and throwing prescription totes out into the patient waiting area). My store manager thinks that if they come down to fire me, it will likely be on our next inventory day (Friday, October 26th) since the district people often come down on inventory days anyways. 

Since this thread is getting kind of buried in /r/pharmacy, I'll create a new one once I have a true update. You all have given me great advice and I appreciate the support very much. I've upvoted everyone in the thread, even those who believe I have acted recklessly and unprofessionally, as even though I disagree with you, I still respect your opinion and it has caused me to look at my situation with a new perspective. If nothing else, it has allowed me to see the perspective that the district people will have in the event that I have a confrontation with them about the positive UDS. 

If there are any other pharmacist cannabis-consumers out there, do tread carefully. Know your workplace's random drug testing policy and have a contingency plan in case you ever get tested. Please, please, please never go to work under the influence of any substance, we do have patients' lives in our hands. What you do at your home is your business, and your business alone. Everyone take care, and do good for goodness' sake. I'll update you all in a new thread ASAP, and I'll continue responding to comments and specific questions in the meantime. 

EDIT: It looks as if I'll be terminated. My store manager says I should walk out voluntarily before the District people come down to fire me on Monday. I'm waiting for the pharmacy manager to call me back to see if there is any way he can intercede for me. I'm still unsure if I should effectively quit at the end of my shift tomorrow or wait for them to tell me I failed and act completely surprised and demand a retest. I'm also unsure if this will go all the way to the Board of Pharmacy. Any advice, pharmacy phriends?

This is a throwaway for anonymity...

Here's the scoop. I'm a pharmacist at a major pharmacy chain, and yesterday, Quest Diagnostics came into my workplace to conduct a random drug screen. I was taking bong rips the night before so I'm 99% it is going to come back positive. I'm getting ready to call an employment lawyer to seek advice, but does anyone out there (especially pharmacists) have any first hand experience or advise with my situation? I'm thinking that the worst-case scenario is I lose my job and my license is suspended, and the best-case scenario is I go on probation with my employer and have to pay for drug rehabilitation counseling.",75,38,2012-10-11,PHARMA,0.06976117193698883,0.9009644389152527,0.029274364933371544

My mum has just 57 years old and for the past 5 years she has been having a lot of troubles with her health. Her symptoms are reoccurring: burning-like headache, dizziness, pressure in the ears, burning-like pain in her lymphs, bloody discharge from her nose and weakness in the knees. 

She had been taking high blood pressure medication and we believed these symptoms were due to the side-effects of the medication. However, doctors have put my mum off these medications for about a month now and even though her blood pressure has remained healthy, she is still experiencing these symptoms. 

At first, my mum was also experiencing hot flushes due to menopause so we thought all these symptoms were also due to that. She has been on natural hormone therapy for over 6 months now, however, and her hot flushes and night sweats have gone away, so we don't think these symptoms are due to menopause.

My mum has seen countless of doctors, had so many ultrasounds, MRIs, CT-scans and many other tests. She's even tried alternative medicines and changed her lifestyle yet nothing seems to work.

It has affected my life to the point where we can't go out together because my mum doesn't feel strong enough, we can't plan any holidays or do anything fun or relaxing as a family.

Every new doctor I see disagrees with the old one.","Hi everyone, a little background: I am a 19 year old male and I have had episodes of painful blisters on my hands for the better part of two years.  [This is a crappy photo of one](http://imgur.com/vibXg).  They are very painful on contact, and I know smoke exposure or extreme temperatures make them more likely to flare.

I won't get into extreme details, but I have been seen by literally over a dozen doctors in the past couple of years.  I just switched once again, as my  most previous doctor moved away and I am now at a new university hospital.  

Last time I was there (at new doc), they brought a team of five people in to listen to the doctor as she made notes and checked me out.  I kind of like her, but she now disagrees with the other practice I have been seeing for a year at another hospital.  She also wants me to take a new medication that I feel really uneasy about taking (nasty potential permanent side effects)

I'm frustrated at this point not knowing what is going on.  Not one single practice has agreed with another previous team who saw me.  Should I stick things out for a while with my new doctor?  Or keep trying?

Health,"Anyone have this Repetitive Stress Injury in fingers? Doctors aren't helping, can you?","I've been dealing with the following RSI for the last year and a half. I have been through a ton of tests with the doctors but they can't diagnose it specifically. 

The final verdict was... 'Chronic Overuse Injury' with a treatment of... 'Don't use your hands'


HOW IT HAPPENED: 
I work on the computer and had a very busy year, working long days on the computer. I them purchased a piano and played the hell out of it for about 3-4 days, at that point my fingers really hurt. I stopped the piano playing and just worked for a few days more but my fingers never got better. I started seeing doctors at that point.

SYMPTOMS: 
It in all fingers in both hands and starts with Tightness, the slowly progresses to the following symptoms in order: Swollen feeling, Ache, Light sharp pain, Sensitive finger pads, Slight burning. I usually stop using them well before they get to the last symptom.

DOCTORS I'VE SEEN &amp; RESULTS: 
General Practitioner, Orthopedist, Physical Therapist &amp; Rheumatologist have all checked me out and can not find anything specifically wrong with my fingers. I've had blood tests, x-rays, bone scan, nerve conduction test, etc. They say it's not tendonitis, not carpal tunnel, not arthritis, not anything with a name.They basically gave it a generic name of Chronic Overuse Injury, and told me to stop using your hands.

WHAT HELPS AND WHAT DOESN'T: 
Feels Better - Not using my hands, Cold compress, Compression gloves (used for arthritis normally).
No Noticeable Effect - Stretching, Pain medications.
Feels Worse - Heat pads or anything that increases bloodflow.

CURRENT STATUS
I've seen some improvement over the last year and a half but I'm far for fixed. I've completely changed the way I work. I have a split keyboard, left &amp; right vertical mice (I switch hands constantly), a foot pedal that clicks the left mouse key, dictation software for emails and I take a 10 min break every 30 min.

I've had numerous surgeries until I was 13 then decided to stop. Here's how I look now http://i.imgur.com/3xY5W.png. But I'm not sure how long I've had this issue with blowing my nose so much and so much mucus coming out. It's just always been like that it seems. And for years(Like I said I'm not exactly sure how long but a long ass time) I've been blowing out these boogers. They happen about every week or 2 I blow them out and they usually always look the same. Sometimes they're a bit bigger.

The second picture was last night and usually they're never that dark. When I eat chocolate a little bit of brown comes out, or just if I have some kind of food or sweet that's a certain color a mix of colors that's how some of my snot will look. Sometimes bits of food may come out as well. To me this is normal but I've had so many issues I don't always know what's ""normal"" for me and what's really normal. I've only recently discovered what a deviated septum is, and I believe that's the issue. When I was 13 the last couple of surgeries they did all at once. One was a bone graph to take a piece of bone and put it in the front of my upper jaw. Another was to correct and straighten my nose out. And the third was to make the flap in my throat close properly. 

I'm not sure if I'm leaving anything out. I always have difficulty breathing threw my nose. Especially after I eat I always have to excuse myself because it's so loud and really embarrassing but I'm not sure what else to do. Is there anyway to fix it without major surgery?

Health,Update on my daughter's illness,"A little while ago I posted some facts about my 15 year old daughter and a lot of you were kind enough to give me advice.  She's been ill since January with abdominal pain and vomiting, and we've been largely ignored by the medical profession.  We took her to hospital last month after she was screaming in agony and went into convulsions.  They kept her in for a few hours to rule out appendicitis then sent us home.

Since then she's had six more seizures.  I went to my GP to express my frustration that nothing was being done, and he arranged an abdominal scan and appointments with a neurologist and a gastroenterologist.

She's lost all use of her legs after one of the seizures.  I went back to my GP who advised that she should be in hospital.  I took her there but was turned away again.  I was told to try and bring the neurology booking forward as they felt this was the most important.

I couldn't get one any earlier, but we finally got to go there on Wednesday.  A woman asked some questions, then told us she was a trainee and would speak to someone with more authority.  She left us alone for a while then came back to say that my daughter would have a CT scan in about two weeks and then a follow up appointment in three months.  In the meantime she was to see a psychologist.  She said she couldn't have an EEG because these can only be done when a seizure is actually taking place.

She said that the difficulty would be convincing anyone that she's not simply presenting with a new set of symptoms as an alternative to the vomiting.  Basically she seemed to be suggesting that my daughter's faking it.  She didn't carry out any tests or examinations.

We took her home where she continued to have fairly dramatic and frightening seizures.  She's had six within nine days.

Finally yesterday we decided enough was enough and called an ambulance.  At last we saw someone who seems to have some intelligence.  She told us that they won't do a CT scan on children as it's dangerous.  She took a full history and examined her.  She asked to see how she can stand, which is something neither the hospitals or the neurology trainee had done previously.  She can't stand, basically her legs are as effective as strings of spaghetti and she starts to shake as soon as she's vertical, but that needs to be seen to be understood. She also watched a video we took of one of the seizures.

We've now got an appointment for an EEG on Wednesday and they're arranging an MRI scan.  We're also going to get the loan of a wheelchair.  

Prior to my insistence that something more be done my daughter has been on a waiting list for a psychologist since March and nothing else had been offered.  If I hadn't made a fuss that would still be the case, which is scary.

Health,Mysterious illness has been ruining my quality of life for 2 years now. Nobody knows the cause. Anyone?,"So almost 2 years ago I first started noticing that I was sweating a bit more than usual. No big deal. However then followed a summer in which I noticed that I was constantly hot even when other people weren't. I would get random hot flashes even in air-conditioned rooms or when it's cooler.

Then the following winter I noticed that I was still sweating and feeling hot even though I was outside with a t-shirt at 10-15 degrees Celsius. Without much movement I would be more or less OK, but as soon as I just walked at a leisurely pace for 10 minutes I would be sweating, no matter how warm or hot it is. Basically this is still my state and it's becoming fucking unbearable, because I constantly feel hot, walking for just a few minutes causes me to be completely drenched from top to bottom. Even sometimes just sitting at home I get random hot flashes out of nowhere. Ironically I feel better when it's hot and sunny during Summer because it's drier, sweating is more normal then and I notice it less.

I don't think it's only something like excessive sweating (hyperhydrosis) because I literally feel exhausted during those episodes also, sometimes I get random palpitations as well. If I can sit down for 20 minutes, my body slowly calms it self down. 

I used to go weightlifting and swimming for 2 years until last March, when due to this problem, I couldn't do it any longer (I'd start feeling really hot when swimming, and lifting would kill me halfway into my workout). In the past few weeks I've been walking a lot due to work and getting exercise that way. Yet after weeks of that, I still feel like crap. So it's not like lack of exercise could have caused this.

Lately I also notice that I am constantly tired and exhausted, no matter how long I sleep or what I do, and I have diarrhea almost every day even though I eat well.

Doctors have so far ruled out: thyroid issues, heart problems, blood pressure/vascular issues (I feel like my blood pressure is elevated often but apparently it only seems that way), all blood and hormone levels are OK too. And slowly I'm running out of possibilities. And no, even though the fear of having another of these episodes of course makes it worse, I am pretty certain that it's not a psychological issue.

If anyone has any idea around here I'd appreciate it because I'm getting quite desperate...I can't even live my life properly anymore, often choose to stay in because I'd rather avoid feeling crap again, and so on.

Health,"A Desperate Plea for Help (11 years suffering, unknown diagnosis)","Hello.

First, thank you for clicking this topic, whether out of curiosity or wanting to help.

This health problem all started roughly 11 years ago.  (2001, age 14)

Around this time, my first signs that something were wrong were being tired all the time, and a skin condition closely resembling seborrheic dermatitis.  My skin was very oily, but dry at the same time.  I would also get very weird pimples, due to hardened sebum plugs. 

As a kid having this condition made me very self conscious and affected my life greatly.

Other symptoms at the time include chronic chapped lips (lips would peel off once or twice a day), thick saliva, and irritated eyes. (everyone always thought I looked stonned and was on drugs)

Went to over 8 dermatologists over the course of the next few years, and didn't get help from anyone.  They tried treating for acne, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, and nothing helped.

Eventually, I stupidly got a dermatologist to let me try Isotretinoin (Accutane, but I was put on 2 different generic brands)

My first course of Isotretinoin was for about 5 or 6 months.  I forget the dosage, but it was normal for my body weight.

After the first course, my oily skin came creeping back along with the seborrheic dermatitis type symptoms.  My pores on my nose would fill with hardened sebum, and protrude from the surface like mini rice grains.

So I went to another dermatologist and got put back on Isotretinoin, but this time a very mild dose just to try and control the oil.

It hardly worked, and ended up making my eyes even more dry then they ever were, made my hair start shedding, and gave me chronic constipation.

That is just a tiny bit of my medical history, so now I'll fast forward to today.

My current symptoms include:

- tiredness (especially after eating)
- swollen eye lids (they get red and inflamed after eating.  Also, when they're at their worse they will get infected and get styes)
- irritated eyes
- chronic nasal problems (runny nose, post nasal drip, etc. seems to get worse due to eating)
- greasy skin on the face, ears, and scalp.  Where the pores and hair follicles are the sebum hardens and protrudes from the skin.  I can run my fingers through my hair, or over my nose and feel tiny balls of hardened sebum.
- chronic constipation (i was constipated a few times as a kid, but this got much worse after isotretinoin.  Every bowel movement I have tears my anus open and I bleed profusely.  The stool is in tiny clumps/balls, sometimes sticking together to form large pieces that are very hard to pass)
- hair loss.  All of the hair that falls out of my scalp has a tiny ball of sebum attached to the bottom of it.  I'm thinking the sebum is blocking nutrients to my hair and causing it to become weak and thin.
- blurred vision occasionally after eating
- chronic dry lips.  My lips use to peel 2x times a day and anytime they would get wet would appear white.  Luckily thanks to a product called Aquaphor, I at least can apply and reduce to the peeling.
- White tongue (the back of my mouth also appears white)
- clusters of red dots near my ankles (mom and sister have this too)
- I use to get heart palpitations (looking back it was definitely connected to eating)

So basically, as you can tell, a lot of my symptoms happen from eating.

Eating what specifically?  I'm not exactly sure, which is why I'm here trying to figure out what's wrong with me.

For the past 11 years I've been doing constant internet searches about my condition, and the best thing I've come up with is Candida.

Based on my self diagnosis, I tried the Candida diet 3 times, and each time after about a 4 month period my symptoms were mildly better.  The constipation will get a lot better, but it takes 3 to 4 months of eating like this for the constipation to alleviate.

I would avoid all processed food, sugar, any gluten, dairy, fruits high in sugar, and would stick to meat, vegetables, apples, berries, brown rice, and some seeds and nuts.

After I would stop the diet, my symptoms would very slowly return.  It takes usually a week for me to start noticing things are getting bad again, and then takes a few months for the symptoms to get very bad.

When I stop the Candida diet, my eyes and eyelids will start to get red, swollen, and irritated.  My saliva will start to get thicker.  My tongue will start to get more white.  My nose will start to run more.  Ill start waking up with mucus in my throat and crust on my eyes.  My constipation will come back, and my bowel movements will start to become painful and make me bleed.

So basically the symptoms aren't instantaneous.  When I start the diet it takes a long time for me to get better.  When I break/come off the diet, the symptoms will very gradually get worse and worse.

One other thing I noticed is that my girlfriend started to get chronic dry lips, and her skin just recently started to get more oily and look like mine.  I'm too afraid to bring it up with her, but I definitely think there is some connection between me being with her, kissing her, having our faces touch, and her symptoms.

I've been to eye doctors, gastros, dermatologists, blood doctors, etc.  And none of them want to make the connection that food makes my symptoms worse.

They always tell me that Candida is something patients with HIV, AIDs and very suppressed immune systems will get, and there is no way I could have it.

Well if I don't have Candida, what other conditions relating to digestion could be doing this to me?  I know Isotretinoin definitely made things worse, but my symptoms existed before taking it.

So from the age of 14, to now 25, I've been dealing with these health issues and have received no real answers or solutions.  The only thing I know as of now is by going on a very strict diet I can alleviate some of the symptoms, but I really don't want to have to live like that for the rest of my life.  My only wish is to give my illness a name so I can finally have peace of mind that I know what is wrong with me, and then from there I can truly figure out ways to treat it.

Please, I ask you to pass on my story and share it with anyone and everyone who may have some advice or be able to help in some way.  By just spreading the word or simply ""upvoting"" this, I hope it will be seen by a lot of people and hopefully get me some help.

Health,I find it difficult to form well worded sentences. It's as though my mind is hazy and I have a hard time piecing words together. What's a good way to improve my verbal/written intelligence?,"By verbal/written intelligence, I don't mean my vocabulary. 

I've been going through a pretty nasty anxiety phase, and it's taking a toll on my mental well being. Sometimes I find it difficult to create sentences that are lengthy, as my thoughts kind of collide and mix together into some weird thought soup that I have to search through in order to find the correct words.

I was fine before the anxiety - my thoughts were clear and weren't so messy. It seems like I think ahead to what I'm going to say next, what I said before, and then finally what I'm trying to say now. It just feels.. messy.

I was looking for supplements to help deal with this, and aniracetam seems like a good choice. It apparently gets rid of 'brain fog' and makes thinking a lot more fluent, as well as increases alertness. 

I've tried exercise, but that makes me feel extremely spaced out and unable to think at all. Also I don't drink coffee, as some mentioned it sometimes  makes thinking kind of shaky and difficult.

medicine,"In your opinion, does the general public really understand the purpose of medicine/the health care system?","I'm an M2 and would really appreciate some feedback on this topic.  Over the last two years, and from my SO being a nurse, I have developed a less than flattering opinion of the general public and their view of the medical system.  What I want to know is if my opinion is jaded and flawed or if it is common among physicians? 
You've all probably seen it, on reddit and in person, a medical/health care related topic comes up and inevitably the conversation digresses and suddenly everyone and their dog has a story about how the health care system screwed them or a close/distant relative at some point.  The conversation quickly becomes about the myriad shortcomings (read: complete fucking incompetence) of physicians, nurses, and the health care system.  
What I have come to understand through my education is a very important point that seems to be lost on the general public - medicine is NOT a perfect science.  It would appear that the majority of people have a completely skewed and romanticized vision of the health care system where they see it as a body that exists to cater to their every whim and diagnose, cure and rehabilitate them with 100% success, no mistakes made and no questions asked.  When in reality there should be a mutual understanding that when a person access medical care it is not unreasonable to assume that everything possible will be done to dx and tx a person, as long as they understand that medicine and physicians have their limits and that's just the nature of medicine. Further, it seems that public opinion seems to have shifted in a way that physicians are viewed as servants and that positive medical outcomes are a patient's god given right.  When in reality, we are purveyors of expert advice and that we do not operate in a field of 100% success.  

Edit 1:  I should specify that when I say 'servant' I mean that sometimes the expectation is that a patient will know their condition and what they need for it, and that a physician is there to provide only what the patient is requesting.

Edit 2:  The issue that I have brought up is something that I experience outside of the hospital/clinic setting.  I have had nothing but positive experiences with patients on my clinical rounds.  They are typically very receptive, willing to listen, and grateful.  This is not an issue of being appreciated or praised by patients, as I have had great patient/dr. relationships with the majority of my patients.  This is an issue of the negativity that I have experience outside the clinical setting.

Does anyone else believe that the discrepancy between patient's expectations and reality has created a very negative public opinion of physicians and health care?  Has anyone thought like this in the past but had their opinion changed by something?  Do more experienced physicians see this issue differently? How do you deal with this issue on a personal and professional level?  Thanks meddit!",80,49,2012-10-16,PHARMA,0.056870054453611374,0.9156428575515747,0.02748711034655571

Health,My vasectomy experience,"I know it's a pretty common procedure, but I was pretty nervous before I had mine done and spent a lot of time reading other people's experiences online. Hopefully this helps other people who are considering having it done. 

**Background:** 
I am a father of 3 sons, ranging in age from 6 years old to 5 weeks. Before we were married, my wife said she wanted 3 or 4 kids, I said 2 or 3. Stopping at 3 seemed like a good compromise.

After our last son was born, I decided to go ahead with a vasectomy. I thought this would be a good time, since we wouldn’t be having sex for a couple months after my wife was recovering from childbirth and dealing with a newborn infant. We had discussed it while she was pregnant and I decided to get things moving.

**The initial consult:**
I was more nervous making that initial phone call to the urologist than I was during the entire procedure. My boss is a physician, so he was able to recommend a urologist whom he knows and trusts, so I felt like I was in pretty capable hands. I set up a consult appointment for later that same week.

The consult was pretty easy. He explained the procedure, glossed over the risks, and asked if I had any questions. He told me to bring a jock strap the day of the procedure and to take that day off from work. He asked if I would need any valium to take on the day of the procedure, but I declined since I thought my nerves would be OK. Then he asked me to drop my pants so that he could do a quick exam. He looked me over, said everything was where it should be, and gave me the go-ahead to schedule the procedure.

The receptionist mentioned that the doctor had an opening the following week, and because I was comfortable with the decision to have it done, I went ahead and booked the appointment for 9:15 Friday morning. 

The pre-procedure checklist I was given said not to worry about doing any manscaping ahead of time. I talked to a few people who suggested I do it anyway, so the night before the big day, I spent some time trimming and shaving. In retrospect, this probably wasn’t necessary, since I shaved the whole testicular area, whereas only a small section near the top needed to be done. This probably would have cut down on some of the post-procedure itching. 

**The procedure:**
I’ve got to admit that Friday morning I was pretty nervous. The doctor said to wear comfortable clothing, so with a jockstrap in hand, I showed up in a pair of whitey-tighties, warm-up pants, and a sweatshirt. I could hear my heart pounding as I walked into the office. The receptionist had me fill out all the paperwork and sign the necessary paperwork. She also gave me the post-procedure checklist and a specimen jar to bring back in 3 months. This way, I could leave right after the procedure without having to check out.

I only had to wait for 30 seconds before my name was called. The nurse took me back to the procedure room. She asked me the usual questions, then left the room and had me undress from the waist down. She came back shortly with the physician and started to get to work. 

They had me lay down on my back. The doctor picked up a razor but didn’t need it. He then poured iodine all over, soaking my privates and thighs. It was cold, and the feeling of it running down my legs and butt was pretty uncomfortable. He then placed a drape over everything, so that only my testicles were showing.

He then did some prodding and squeezing, I’m assuming to locate the proper anatomy, and picked up a syringe. He started with the right side. The injection wasn’t too bad. Ten seconds later, he asked if I could feel any sharp pain. I couldn’t feel anything, so I’m assuming he had cut me open at that point. At this point I could feel some uncomfortable tugging and pulling, nothing really painful or bad. The worst part was when he cauterized the ends of the vas, I could feel a sharp tingle of the electricity (they had placed a grounding pad on my leg). After 10 minutes, the right side was done and we were read to move on to the left side. He asked me one more time if I was sure, since it wasn’t yet too late to try for a girl. 

I felt the same sharp pain of the injection, but was pretty numb after that. During the right side, the physician was pretty chatty. However, he quieted down about 5 minutes in to the left side and I could tell he was focusing more. I could also feel a lot more poking and pulling than on the right side. Apparently, after he had cut the vas, one of the ends had fallen back inside, and he had to go fishing for it. It took him several minutes of somewhat uncomfortable looking before he was able to find it. Again, I could feel the shock of electricity as he cauterized the end. 

After I was sewn up, he placed some gauze over each incision, put the jock strap on me, and told me not to take it off or shower for at least 36 hours. From start to finish, the whole thing took about 45 minutes. I got dressed and left the office feeling pretty good.

**The recovery:**
I drove myself home. I was a little uncomfortable, but overall not bad. I took some Tylenol when I got home and parked myself on the couch. This is when I started to feel like I had spent the morning getting kicked in the balls. At one point I walked into the kitchen and had a bout of nausea because of the feeling. I took it easy the rest of the day. As long as I was sitting, the pain wasn’t bad. That night I found it easiest to sleep with a pillow folded in half between my knees – it provided support, and kept things down there from getting squished. 

The following morning, I inspected myself for the first time. I gently removed the gauze from the right side. The gauze was stuck to the left side, so I had to pull a bit harder. At this point, I could see the incision on the left side open up. The incisions were higher than I expected. They were near the top of each testicle to either side of the base of my penis. It didn’t look like they were bleeding, so I replaced the jock strap and took it easy for day 2 of recovery. Sunday was pretty uneventful and things were feeling much better by Sunday evening. 

**Complications:**
I went back to work Monday. Things were a little painful whenever I stood up and walked around, but overall, not too bad. Tuesday morning started out fine, but by Tuesday afternoon, I could tell something wasn’t right. Instead of continuing to feel better, things were starting to get more painful. By the end of the day Tuesday, the left side had gotten painful to the point that I couldn’t walk without a limp. I went home, sat on the couch and iced my testicles for the first time since Saturday. 

It felt even worse on Wednesday morning.  The right side was perfectly fine and pain-free, but I could feel a large, solid mass in the left testicle that stretched from right above the ball to where the scrotum meets my abdomen. The pain was also radiating up into my abdomen. The incision on that side was still not healed shut and was oozing. At this point I decided that if things didn’t improve by Friday, I would give the doctor a call. 

Friday came, and I was still in pain with a large lump in the left side and an oozing incision. I called the doctors office around 10:45 and the nurse said they could fit me in at 11:00 if I could make it. The doctor who did the procedure was in surgery, so I was examined by another physician in the practice. 

After some painful prodding and squeezing, he said he thought there was some bleeding into the tube that was putting pressure on things and causing pain. He never mentioned the word “hematoma”, but I assume that is what he diagnosed since it matches the description and it’s one of the more common side-effects of a vasectomy. The stitches had popped out of the incision, but he didn’t seem concerned. 

He prescribed me an antibiotic to take 4 times a day for 10 days, and told me to take a Motrin 3 times a day. He also scheduled a follow-up appointment a week later. 

I’m on my 5th day of antibiotics now and things are definitely improving. The left side is still in some pain, but it is no longer interfering with my walking. I’m still wearing a jock strap and/or tighty-whities, but I can feel the mass in the left side is getting smaller, although it is still pretty hard. 

I definitely didn’t anticipate that a week-and-a-half later I would still be in pain from a vasectomy. 

**UPDATE (12 days post procedure):** I was feeling pretty good yesterday when I wrote the initial post. I should have known that was too good to be true. Last night before I went to bed I started to feel some discomfort in the left side - like my underwear was too tight. I woke up this morning with my left testicle in pain again. The hematoma, which I thought had been shrinking, was again large and hard. I did some rough-housing with the kids after I got home from work and may have overdone it. I've got another appointment with the urologist in 5 days, so hopefully things are improving by then. Still taking Motrin and antibiotics. 

**UPDATE (14 days post procedure):** Wow. It feels like there is a lemon inside my left nut sack. There is some new bruising that showed up. It hurts to stand up and walk. 

**UPDATE (18 days post procedure):** After a few rough days with a large, swollen, painful left testicle, things are finally starting to feel better. The swelling is definitely going down and the pain is significantly diminished. There is still a hard knot in the epididymis, but it is slowly decreasing in size. I finished up my 10-day course of antibiotics and went back to see the urologist yesterday. He examined me, and said he thought there may have been an infection. There is still some swelling, but things look good. He said to continue taking it easy for a while and to call if things start going downhill again. At the moment I'm feeling good. It's amazing the difference a week makes. 

**UPDATE (5 weeks post procedure):** 5 weeks later and things are almost back to normal. There is still a bit of mild aching on the left side from time to time. It's not too bad. I haven't started running again, though. The swelling is almost gone - instead of there being a rock-hard lump in the epididymis, it is slightly-enlarged and squishy. I can feel a tiny bit of pain before and after ejaculation, but again, it's minor and doesn't interfere with anything. Incisions are healed.

Pt arrives via ambulance s/p physical altercation. Has strong odor consistent with the ingestion of alcoholic beverages, and admits to consumption of ETOH. Pt states he was shoved by a friend whom he was visiting through a glass table top. EMS and law enforcement state the glass was quite thick, but still shattered, being 3/4 of an inch thick.

Half way through closing a 6 cm scalp laceration, questions about the need for sutures arose, and ""butterfly"" closures were mentioned.

""Sir, you were shoved head first through a 3/4 inch thick glass patio table, and knicked a small artery. I can neither physically, nor ethically, ""just put a couple butterflies on it"" for you.""

The patient requested several times after the wound was closed if we could ""just take them [staples and sutures] out"", and replace them with butterflies ""So I don't have to come back here"".

I'm a human being, which means I have a body that will someday cease to live.  I would like that body to be as beneficial in death as possible, but I'm not sure which route makes more sense.  The need for bodies in med school makes a ton of sense to me, but I'm curious about the effect of one body:  

* Does it just mean that two future-docs won't have to share a body? How big of a difference does that make to someone's education?   

* Do you think it's likely to improve that eventual doctor's ability/knowledge to the extent that lives will be saved?  

* How does that number of lives saved compare to the tangible and immediate lives that could be saved from transplanting my organs?  

* How many critical organs from a typical organ donor are salvageable/transplantable?

* What percentage of organ donors end up actually being able to donate viable organs?

* If I die in such a way that my organs can't be donated, could my body then be donated to a med school instead?

Pt c/o SOB, general weakness, and dizziness. Pt is initially found to be tachicardic at 120, moderately hypertensive at 185/90, mildly hypoxic at 95% and febrile with a temperature of 100.9^o F. She states her shortness of breath began around noon this morning, and the weakness has been ongoing for 2-3 days now.

While speaking with the patient and her POA, I learned that she had recently come to the emergency room for chest pain, where she was found to have ST elevation, and positive cardiac enzymes. Following diagnosis and administration of morphine, she signed out AMA. Her surrogate relayed the following when I asked why, ""Her husband died several years ago, and she's been very lonely ever since. She's also started to enter the early stages of dementia, and will sometimes forget he's gone, say something to him, and turn to realize he's no longer there. At least twice a week she relives losing him all over again. I don't want you to think she wants to die or something, but she'd rather not delay the inevitable. 

It's happening soon, she knows that, but she just doesn't want it to be painful when it comes. She feels awful for using the ER like that, and so do I, but the last time she was on hospice, she recovered. They couldn't keep a woman with a couple years left in a bed that could be occupied by someone else, and sent her home. She just wants to know what's going to take her, and how to let it take her as peacefully as possible, preferably while she watches the news in John's favorite chair""

After pausing to choke back emotion, I explained what test we would be running, and how I would relay her request to the attending. ""I understand what you want, and I support you entirely. It's your body, and your life, you've lived many years, and I feel you've earned the right to finish your care on your own terms.""

Blood tests and UA lead to a diagnosis of CHF and UTI. When it was suggested that she be admitted, she requested to leave AMA once again. She was prescribed diuretics and antibiotics for home, and advised to take her previously prescribed pain medications as needed.

Health,Is it healthy to drink saltwater?,"I'm a 17 year old male. I've been sort of having fatigue issues for a while. It's like I *always* need a nap, and it's like it's never comfortable to have my eyes open. I don't know. On top of it, I always have had this vague not-a-headache-but-a-headache in the right part of my head, near my right eye. It doesn't hurt, but it hurts. It felt like I was constantly drained of *something*.

I remember that I would drink Gatorade when I was younger to relieve headaches, and I had noticed that I generally felt better and more lively recently whenever I ate pickles and drank the juice from the pickle jar. I put two and two together (hey, very salty liquids make me feel great) and started drinking a glass or two of saltwater every now and then (a cup of microwaved water with a decent amount of salt stirred in, probably more than a teaspoon, the water definitely tastes salty but not obnoxiously so), and lo and behold, I feel much better. I don't feel the constant urge to nap and the headache-y thing in the corner of my eye is gone (my main evidence that it's not placebo).

Also, I sweat an abnormal amount for some reason- I'm talking shirt completely drenched after about an hour of fairly vigorous exercise, and I'm not in bad shape-and I have P.E. every day for an hour and a half, where I play decently intense basketball most days. The class is also the first thing in the morning, and I only eat a couple of small granola bar things and drink only water at school for the next 6ish hours. So it makes sense that I would build up an electrolyte shortage or whatever after a while, and that drinking a tall glass of ions periodically could help with my fatigue issues.

Is this harmful in any way? Could I do it safely 2-4 days a week? I don't eat a very high-sodium diet otherwise.",16,4,2012-10-21,PHARMA,0.050713054835796356,0.9116650819778442,0.03762182593345642

medicine,5 year survivor,"One day at school, exactly five years ago, when I was in the seventh grade, I was feeling completely normal until 3rd block.  I started showing stroke like symptoms, and although my best friend Tucker originally thought I was faking, he describes it as if I had suddenly contracted Down syndrome.  My tongue flipped and I couldn't feel the right half of my body, I couldn't walk, see or speak.  The school nurse thought I was on drugs (I wasn't, and at that time had never done drugs) so they called my grandparents (my father was deployed and my mother was at work in another city).  Some stupid stuff with arguments and whatnot goes on and I end up in the hospital with all of the doctors clueless.  They did a spinal tap (fucking ow!) and several MRI's to find out that the myelin sheath on my brain was non-existent. I had a fairly rare ailment called ADEM ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis#section_4 ), that basically meant that when I had a sinus infection one week prior and was prescribed antibiotics, my antibodies pretty much turned on me and attacked my brain.  All in all, recovery took about 6 months, and I now suffer from a speech impediment and a very fucked up center of gravity ( I'm all off balanced).

TL;DR- I had an ADEM ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis#section_4 ) attack and I overcame the 5% mortality rate, which scared me when I first heard of it. Now I'm off balanced with a speech impediment.

I found a previous Reddit post of people testifying that priobiotics reduced or entirely eliminated their anxiety. 

Here's an example of some press:

If I could reduce the amount of anxiety I feel (which can be a lot) by sprinkling some probiotic on my oatmeal in the morning... uhhhh sign me up.

However, some of these things are expensive! Does anyone have experience with this or have any recommendations for the right strains to purchase?

Edit: Thanks for the feedback everyone, didn't foresee this spurring such passionate discussions. Who knew that we could get so heated over gut bacteria.

UPDATE - 8:45pm- UPDATE: so my girlfriend just informed me that her parents got a new couch delivered on Tuesday and had it covered in something called ""Scotchgaurd"". She proceeded to take a nap on the couch Wednesday night and after she woke up that is when the swelling started she says. She also says that the side of her left eye was swollen but not her right eye, and the left eye was in contact with the couch while sleeping. Is it possibly she could of had an allergic reaction to the chemicals on the couch?
Since benedryl brought down the swelling so well so fast, is it possible that this is the reason? I figured that benedryl wouldn't help that much if it was something major.

But from what I can tell my symptoms match with GERD pretty well. The symptom that bothers me the most is the chest pain. When I had insurance a few years I had an EKG done and my doctor said there was nothing wrong with my heart. But everytime I get chest pain it freaks me out. Anyone else have this problem? Also, I'd like to know if any of you have changed your diet and if so with what foods worked best for you and any advice for switching and sticking with to better foods.

medicine,Best anatomy book,"Hi, Meddit! I know there's already been a favourite anatomy book discussion, but my request is slightly different. I know little about biology and anatomy, and I'm not going to medical school in the near future, but I'm quite passionate about medicine and I would love to study it in my free time. 

So, what's the best book/textbook out there to study anatomy? I need not just an atlas but something more descriptive and theoretical, so I have a better understanding of how human body works rather than just know the names of all parts.

So far, I've come across the following books:

""Gray's Anatomy"" EDIT:What do you think of [this version](http://www.amazon.com/Grays-Anatomy-Anatomical-Clinical-Practice/dp/0443066841/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351338835&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=gray's+anatomy)?

Moore and Dalley's ""Clinically Oriented Anatomy""

Netter's ""Atlas"" (but I'm guessing there's little description there)

What's the standard now, and what's the most universal book with most material which will be sufficient for the study?",33,10,2012-10-27,PHARMA,0.023875821381807327,0.9322861433029175,0.04383810982108116

I have having problems that sometimes when I orgasm and ejaculate I get really sensitive to the point to where it feels like I have to urinate constantly for about an hour or two afterward.  When I do urinate it burns like hell.  (This even happened before becoming sexually active, and I am STD free.)  Now I have this condition and getting nauseous at the same time.  It honestly feels like I have blue balls, when I ejaculated a good amount.  The nausea is right around the prostate region, and the sensitivity is around the urethra.  This has ailed me ever since I have started masturbating and was wondering if anyone had answers.
