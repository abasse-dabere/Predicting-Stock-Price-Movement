Health,Healthy snacks for teenagers to take for school lunches,"I'm recently separated and am making a commitment to myself and my kids to have healthy choices for food for us.

My kids are 12, 14, and 18. What are some healthy things they can take to school for lunches that they'll actually enjoy. I know obvious things like fruit or carrots but they are very used to loading up on empty carbs and completely processed foods and they just roll their eyes at me when I suggest apples and carrots.",36,26,2010-10-01,PHARMA,0.022266047075390816,0.9200100302696228,0.05772390216588974

Most of it has been based around Trigger Point, but we've used a few other (non-named) techniques too. I've had two massage therapists (moved to Seattle a few months ago), and they've both been OUTSTANDING. 

Yesterday was my most recent session, and after the hour was done I realized my right scapula was able to move again. Honestly, I hadn't even realized it couldn't, but now when comparing the two my left shoulder just moves around to compensate, and I can feel the right gliding and moving like it should. I have a huge (and persistent) increase in range of motion!

Health,"How long does it take a coma patient to die of a)dehydration, b)hunger?","More particularly, I was watching the new Darabont series 'The Walking Dead' and wondered why the main character hadn't perished in the hospital when there was no-one tending him during his 'coma'. Seems like he was unconscious for over a week at least.

Would a coma or a deep sleep slow down the body's requirement for water/nourishment? Or would 3-4 days without water still remain the standard? 

And by 'patient' I mean someone in a coma that is untended - no drip, no aid, etc.",4,3,2010-10-31,PHARMA,0.07897739112377167,0.8875207304954529,0.03350183740258217
