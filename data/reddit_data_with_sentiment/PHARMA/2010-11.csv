Health,Crippling weakness after breaking a fast that isn't blood sugar related. Any ideas?,"*I feel like a bit of a jerk for making this my first post on Reddit, but I feel the need to ask*

If I don't eat for six or more hours, the next time that I eat I become extremely weak. This currently lasts for over 4 and a half hours. I have gone up to 24 hours without eating and experienced no ill effects (besides normal hunger), but within minutes of eating something, the weakness will hit. It is difficult for me to walk or open containers during this period of weakness- my movements seem to be in slow motion. 

What I eat doesn't seem to matter. I have tested with a single piece of beef jerky, a candy bar, bran flakes, yogurt, a tuna sandwich, and everything else I could think of- anything more substantial than water or gatorade seems to trigger the problem. I try to eat every 4 hours, to keep it from happening, but if I oversleep whatever I eat for breakfast will trigger it. This began in December of 2009, though the weakness only lasted about 1 hour to start. In late July/early August, it lasted about two and a half. The entire time, my blood sugar tests normal.


Possibly useful information (**warning: possibly icky**)

*I suffer from an undiagnosed stomach problem, which causes severe pain, GI bleeding, naseau, diziness, constipation/diahrrea, grey stool, black and tarry stool, watery stool,  sensitivity to touch, and cramping. Sometimes it makes me feel weak, but never to the extent of this other problem, so I am unsure if they are related. This begain in October of 2007. The only foods that seem to cause a problem are raw leafy greens and bananas. I take dicyclomine 20mg 4 times a day, tramadol 50 mg 3 times a day, and omeprazole 20 mg twice a day for this.

*I have Depression/Anxiety disorder and mild OCD, for which I take 150mg of imiprmamine a night.

*I have hypertension, for which I take 5mg of lisinopril every morning

*I am also sensitive to sunlight. Spending time in direct sunlight makes me feel tired and sick, so I 
usually carry an umbrella with me. This runs in my mom's family.

*Tests I have had: endoscopy and colonoscopy, allergy tests, dozens of blood tests, blood sugar monitoring, CT with contrast of the gallbladder, CT of the abdomen, ultrasounds, urine tests

*Things doctors have ruled out: Crohn's, Celiac, wheat or gluten allergy, diabetes, hypoglycemia (five days of blood sugar monitoring, with a sample taken every five minutes, showed normal, even when weak), gallstones, kidney stones, lactose intolerance, potassium paralysis

*I have tried a host of dietary plans, ranging from Atkins to vegan, and am currently eating 30-35 grams of fiber a day

*I have also tried modifying/reducing/stopping my medications, both individually and all at once. This seemed to only make things worse.

Does anyone have any idea what the heck is going on?

**tl;dr** Breaking a fast of six or more hours causes me to be horribly weakened. It's not hypoglycemia.

**Edit** Thanks to the people who have commented! ""Weakness"" is a bit vague, so here are some details about it: Normal movement, such as moving my arms around, becomes tiring. A sudden increase in gravity is the best approximation I've been able to come up with. Walking more than a couple hundred feet, in addition to being much slower than normal, is as tiring as walking a mile or more. Simply sitting and watching a movie or reading is, after two or three hours, exhausting, and I generally end up taking a nap or at least laying down.
My ability to push and/or lift is greatly reduced. Lifting a gallon of milk one handed is difficult, and occasionally requires two hands, and attempting to lift a 40 pound bag of dog food proved impossible, and resulted in sore arms for most of the day. A female friend, whom I can normally beat easily in arm wrestling (even if she cheats and uses both arms), is able to pin my arm, albeit with some effort involved. 
My reflexes are slowed as well. The specifics vary slightly from day to day, but several tests (hitting the leg with a hammer in the stereotypical reflex test, during both normal and weak periods) reveal a noticeable delay and reduced response, from about half the normal ""kick"" to the leg barely twitching.",19,7,2010-11-06,PHARMA,0.13769320398569107,0.8283638954162598,0.03394289314746857

Health,Is drinking diet soda that bad?,"About three years ago I was a pretty heavy diet soda drinker.  After consulting my doctor about my intake of diet soda he kind of gave me a doctor’s answer.  Basically to much of anyone thing is bad for you type of answer.  I decided that I was going to stop drinking soda all together and replaced sodas with water, lemonade, low cal drinks.  I stayed strong at it for about 8 months.  Not a single sip of soda.  Then I decided that I could control myself and would have a soda or two with dinner only.  That went on for about 3 months.  I was then shipped off to somewhere where soda wasn’t available.   I was back off of soda for about 8 months.  Then I got a new job.  Next thing I know everyone around me is drinking soda all the time and you know what that means as soon as I see someone with soda I get one.  Currently I drink a maximum of 88 ounces of diet soda a day, basically two 7-eleven big gulps at most (to be fair I would say 4 cans of soda a day is more accurate) .  This is throughout a 24 hour period.  I start drinking soda around 10 am and finish at 10 pm.  I am pretty picky and will only drink diet Pepsi.   Not cause its 0 calories, but because I dislike the thickness of regular soda if you understand what I mean.  I also drink plenty of water and juice through out the day as well.  I am pretty much drinking something at all times.  I can’t bear the taste or smell of coffee.  I rarely drink alcohol and don't use tobacco products.  I really have no addictions, except for soda.  As for health I work out at least 4 times a week.  My exercise consists of weights, biking, and running.  I consider myself in good shape for my age and my job demands I strong level of physical conditioning.   I just wanted to ask reddit what you opinions of drinking diet soda are?

I recently fractured my ankle and tore the ligament and have a cast on. This is a first for me and the doctors told me to have plenty of bed rest and not put pressure or strain on the ankle at all, obviously. 
However, this means I won't be able to work out at the gym which I've normally been doing until now.

I usually didn't pay too much attention to what I ate and when I ate it and the eating habits I had. I know eating plays an enormous role in health and I'm a bit sad I've been ignoring it for so long.

Therefore, I would appreciate any tips and how-to's on eating correctly. I would like to note that I'm 19 and I don't know much about nutrition at all, so any information will help. Thanks!",16,3,2010-11-13,PHARMA,0.037846118211746216,0.901547372341156,0.06060655042529106

Health,Sudden drastic loss of alcohol tolerance - bad sign?,"Hi everyone,  I'm hoping somebody here can shed some insight on something very odd that has happened to my girlfriend.  We're both in our early 20s, and when I met her she drank regularly and could drink quite heavily with apparently no ill effects.

Now I do think her drinking was excessive and she agrees and has cut down dramatically, so obviously some loss of alcohol tolerance is expected.

However, 6 months ago she could drink 8+ beers in a night and be understandably drunk, but functional, not sick, and not hung over.

Now, 2 beers, even spaced out, will keep her very drunk for hours, 3 beers in a night almost always makes her sick.  She is 5'8"" and about average build so there is no way her BAC even breaks 0.04 by my estimation.

An obvious solution is to not drink, but I'm very worried this may be a sign of something worse.  Could liver damage/failure from past drinking be making her unable to process alcohol now?

The only other thing I could find is various health sites proclaiming this a symptom of Candida overgrowth in the gut.  She also recently started taking hormonal birth control, which apparently can contribute to Candida growth.  However I can't find anything from a reliable source about 'Candida overgrowth' in the gut, and the site that do talk about it seem to be of the fruitcake variety.

Thoughts/suggestions/similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.  

EDIT:  One thing I forgot about because it's not current.  When we went on a tropical vacation in early September she got some serious eye irritation and the quack doctor there had no idea what the cause was so he just gave her oral antibiotics.  I don't know the exact day but I'm pretty sure her symptoms either started or drastically worsened after vacation.  This would lend credence to the Candidosis theory, as BS as it sounds.",38,16,2010-11-21,PHARMA,0.11394792795181274,0.858168363571167,0.02788364514708519

Health,Any fellow tinnitus sufferers out there (ringing in the ears)? Looking for some coping methods,"Been suffering with it for about 14 years (I'm 33), slowly getting worse. I used to be able to have a fan on in the room and that was enough to cover it up, but now even sitting in my living room with the TV on isn't enough. I've been to the Dr. many times and recently had a hearing test which showed no damage or hearing loss.

I've been hearing about tinnitus retraining therapy but not sure if it's a waste of money or not. I'm hoping maybe some fellow tinnitus sufferers out there might have some advice or little secrets they have to help lower the volume a bit, this constant noise can so easily drive me crazy.

tl;dr I have intense ringing in my ears 24/7 and am looking for help and tips from others with same affliction. Basically I've never been able to enjoy a moment of silence in my adult life.

EDIT:

""Nice"" is definitely the wrong word since we're suffers from it but it is comforting to know I'm not alone. I've actually gone to some doctors that told me I was making it up, which when I was younger hurt and I just stopped telling anyone about the suffering. 

Acceptance is definitely the best coping mechanism, and 99% of the time that's good enough for me. It's just that other 1% of the time where it gets to me and I want to enjoy a moment of quiet.

Health,Anyone else on here have Chronic Epstein Barr Virus or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome? I have no one to talk to about this that has been through it...,"I had mono about three years ago. Since then I have had severe fatigue. It is so bad that a hefty dose of Concerta doesn't override the fatigue! I am a senior in college but rarely go out, despite the desire to, just because I am so tired. I finally have learned that I have CEBV. There really is no cure so I was wondering if anyone on here had any insights. 

   I know this is long, wordy, and may not get much attention. My hope is someone else is going through dealing with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Chronic Epstein Bar Virus and can offer me their story. I would be interested to learn all of your symptoms no matter how small they may seem...What things seems to help or make your symptoms worse? Do people tend to understand what you are going through? Have you tried any treatments and do you exercise?

   Here is background on what I've been through. Doctors have diagnosed me with all kinds of things over the years and all were wrong. I was diagnosed with depression (Wellbutrin, Prozac, Cymbalta), chronic tonsillitis (they took out my tonsils), low hormones (DHEA supplement), hypersomnia (Provigil, Concerta). At some points, it seemed like my doctors thought I was just making the whole thing up.

   Finally, a month ago I got the correct diagnosis. I went to a doctor and she thought to check and see if I still have Epstein Barr Virus active in my body, this is the virus that causes mononucleosis. Guess what? I did! She said I have probably had it active in my body for the past three years and that is why I am so tired. The doctor who diagnosed me with chronic tonsillitis and decided to take out my tonsils was crazy to not check this! He took the tonsils out of a person with mono. It was supposed to be an out patient procedure but I ended up in the hospital for a week and was back in the hospital a few days after being discharged. At the time I didn't know why I had so much trouble with the surgery but now it makes perfect sense.

   I am looking forward to finding someone to connect to! My family and friends are supportive but having someone who can really relate to what I am going through would be so amazing right now...

Health,"Really embarrassing! Is this herpes? (Pic, cropped but probably still not too appealing)","Before I say anything else, I just want to say that I do not have medical insurance at the present time so I cannot go to a doctor with this. I have an appointment at a free clinic in 2 weeks but want some insight on this before then.

Background: I am a 21 year old female and had my first and last one night stand over the summer in early Augustish. We used a condom. Around the end of September I noticed I had these bumps around my anus and sort of near my vaginal lips. They didn't hurt and when messed with they would bleed but no other substance would come out. It is now late November and they have not gone away. They are not irritating in any way, sort of just like hard pimples. On two occasions, one would itch, get inflamed and then go away. The fact that they aren't painful and have been there consistently for such a long period of time makes me question if they are in fact herpes. (Wishful thinking, possibly!) But I don't know what else they could be and they look a lot like herpes. :(
