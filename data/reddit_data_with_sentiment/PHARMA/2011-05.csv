Health,"I have been taking Zyrtec every day for over 3 years because of HIVES - help me, Reddit!","I should mention that I have Type 1 Diabetes and this problem started after I was diagnosed but not directly after. It was more like 1 year after I was diagnosed, so I don't think the insulin is what's causing the allergic reaction. The hive outbreaks are nasty and start with itching. They usually occur in places where my skin is agitated, such as around the waistline of my pants, my palms/hands, my neck/collar, all over my back, my scalp - anywhere, really. The *only* thing that stops the hives is Zyrtec, one pill every day. I've tried other allergy meds and it's the only one that stops the itching and hives. If I stop taking zyrtec, I get hives within 48 hours and I have to start taking it again.

I have been unsuccessful at identifying any possible trigger. I have changed shampoos, soaps, detergents, bed sheets, etc. I have tried different diets and not eating out. I tried cutting out all wheat and gluten. I've tried new clothes, new surroundings, and I've even changed apartments twice since the hives started. Nothing seems to help. I have already brought this up with my doctor several times and she doesn't seem to care about the problem - she just tells me to keep taking Zyrtec. She says an allergy test most likely will not help identify the problem and I tend to agree - when I was little I had an allergy test and tested positive to just about everything anyway (although that was a long time ago and I don't have many problems with allergies other than the occasional stuffy nose and of course the hives).

So, er. I've been thinking about it a lot, and if I do what I love, I'm going to end up with a degree in philosophy. I have every MCAT prereq finished with an A except three, Math up to Calculus 2 (might get a B in calc 2 this semester, but an A in every class before that and a decent shot at an A in calc 2), actually have a 4.0. 

The only med school prereqs I don't have are Ochem 1 and 2 and the second half of Calc-based Physics. 

I'm thinking philosophy because I love arguing, ethics, public speaking, writing and debate. I love them so much I do them in my off-time. 

With this in mind, if I get a 4.0 in all the med school prereqs (OChem is obviously a bump in the road, but I have a lot of 4.0 sGPA credit padding at this point and only 3 total science classes left), do you folks think it would be okay to do a philosophy major?",28,3,2011-05-04,PHARMA,0.021504396572709084,0.9205916523933411,0.057903919368982315

I bitch about little things with my friends at work all the time, and normally I would've just told the guy to get the fuck out of the room and ripped him a new asshole, but he did this in front of a student who was sent in to observe how to do postmortem prep in the ED, so I couldn't exactly make a scene and in turn a worse impression on the student nurse.

So, I took the student aside, explained exactly what was wrong about that, what should've happened, and that I didn't say anything in there because I didn't want to make a bad situation worse (though I doubt anyone would've seen that and went ""Seems completely acceptable to cork off a dead patient's orifices."")

Health,"Unexplained, constant nausea for 8 days and counting","You know that feeling you get right before you vomit?  You hyper-salivate, have that thick knot in your throat and maybe a feeling of impending doom...well, I've been stuck in that feeling for days.

I have not actually vomited, but feel a strong urge to force myself to.  I attempted that on Day 1 and 2, but the act of vomiting only added a headache and did nothing for eliminating the nausea.  This may be unrelated, but on Day 5 the skin around my right eye suddenly went very puffy and so swollen that my girlfriend exclaimed ""DANG GIRL WHO HIT YOU??"".  On Day 6 the swelling resolved.

I have been unable to use the computer for long, read, focus my vision on the TV, stand, exercise or do *anything* except cower on my couch and sleep.

My health is otherwise excellent; I work hard in a physically-demanding job, am in great shape and have a normal omnivorous diet.  I'm certain it isn't diet-related and it has been going on for too long to resemble a virus.  I'm able to eat, though my appetite is shot, and the only thing that helps is trees.

Any ideas?

EDIT:  Have seen a doctor with inconclusive results.  I'm hoping to find someone else who has experienced constant nausea - what helps?  What was *your* diagnosis?  If I'm after a second medical opinion, I want to be able to ask the Dr. ""what about X?  Or Z?""  Thanks!

EDIT DOS: The possibility of me being pregnant isn't **totally** out of the question, but I have not had any action since my last period.  I understand how that may not matter, but it would be highly unlikely.

tl;dr Can I get my deceased mothers blood from the hospital for novel genetic testing purposes?

Health,What in the hell is wrong with my toe? [pics inside],"I've had on and off problems with fungal infections and also with blisters, especially on my smaller toe. Lately I've been getting more blisters, which, with some TLC tend to go away after a few weeks. It's hard keeping them patched up, though. 

Now I think I need to go to to the doctor (which I will do first thing in the morning when the offices are open). But can you tell me what the hell you think is going on here? The toe is pretty swollen and a fair bit of plasma gets soaked into the gauze I leave taped on while I wear shoes.

I'm pretty active, walk several miles a day and bike several miles a day, which I'm sure don't do anything but aggravate the situation.

medicine,"Starting tomorrow, my hospital will begin turning away non-emergent patients who come to the ED on Medicaid or with no insurance.","Starting with Monday's second shift, a PA will begin staffing triage and have a fee schedule for several common conditions that people misuse the ED for. After assessing that the patient is in no immediate danger, they will inform them that the conditions of EMTALA have been fulfilled by their basic medical exam, and their condition does not require emergency treatment. If they would still like to seek treatment, they will be required to pay up front for anything further.

If they don't wish to pay, they will be sent to the next room to meet with a case manager who will provide them with information on the proper place to seek that type of care is, and how to treat the condition with items available OTC until then. Though I think the end result will mostly be ""You have a GP, call them, and in the meantime, take some Motrin to reduce the fever and pain.""

Health,Question about Anxiety,"I've had a lot of people tell me that I'm way too stressed out about everything, and a few have recommended I get checked out for an anxiety disorder. In the past I've always shrugged it off. So I worry a lot. Big deal, right?

Lately though, I've been noticing a few behaviors of myself and I'm wondering if perhaps there's some truth to their words...

First red flag I noticed recently was when I was talking to my doctor about losing weight (I'm about 10-15lbs overweight. Certainly not unhealthy, but who doesn't wanna lose weight?) because for a few months I was eating healthy and working out but not seeing any difference in my measurements or my weight. My doctor went over my food logs and said I was doing great in terms of diet and exercise, and then she asked me ""How are your stress levels?"" I wouldn't think too much of them, but everyone else says I have above-average stress levels.

I'm constantly worrying about projects or people, I multitask to the point of breakdown because I can't handle everything at once, and I get irritated really easily when I'm under pressure. Odd, because I actually function better when I'm under pressure. 

Secondly, I've noticed lately that I have a very slight speech stutter. It's not terrible, but people notice it. When I get really anxious, I stumble over my words like crazy. Also happens when I get really excited or angry. When I'm just having a normal conversation or reading aloud, it's not there.

Third, and this is what really kicked me off, was a [post I read over at r/2XC](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/hc5zn/i_have_a_confession_i_cant_stop_doing_it/) about skin-picking. Reading all of the other comments in the thread about women with similar problems set the alarm bells ringing in my head. I've obsessively picked at imperfections on my skin for years. It started when I had really bad acne as a teenager and my mom would pop my blackheads for me. I get really self-conscious and when I'm nervous I'll unconsciously start feeling my arms and face for bits of flaky skin or blackheads to pop. 

I also pick at my nail cuticles and the skin around my nails to the point where I almost always have at least one open sore on a hand at any given time. I don't chew my nails - again, influenced by my mom. My mom loved her natural fingernails and so we'd always do each other's nails together. But my mom would also take nail clippers or cuticle scissors and trim excess skin at the tips of my fingers or push and trim my cuticles.

My mom had very mild anxiety, and she died 6 years ago (6 years ago yesterday, actually). 

Does R/Health think I might have some signs of anxiety? How should I go about talking to my doctor about it? Should I see a Psych instead of my general physician?

Health,Lyme Testing: Is this a hoax?,"I've been quite sick for over five frustrating years and have gotten no conclusive answers. My doctor recently hypothesized I might have Lyme disease. He referred me to a NP that specializes in diagnosing Lyme disease. He ordered a special test (CD57), from a specific lab (Lab Corp), on her instructions. The test came back positive. And now I am vacillating between joy that this nightmare might finally be over, and worry that I am being caught up in something of a hoax.


After some research, I have found two things: 1) It IS the received view amongst reputable physicians that untreated Lyme disease carries with it devastating long-term health problems, many of which are consistent with my symptoms. However, 2) there also seems to be a less reputable diagnosis of Chronic Lyme disease. Many doctors do not recognize this latter form as a disease at all. And, from what I have seen, there is some definite sketchiness involved; it almost appears as if a pseudo-scientific cottage industry has sprung up catering to the sick and desperate. 


The problem is trying to figure out if the testing and diagnosis I've been given provides legitimate evidence of long-term untreated Lyme disease, or if I'm getting sucked into the latter camp of Chronic Lyme disease. I've been sick for so long I can't afford either the time or money involved in another wild-goose chase. So I'm trying to be rational about this. I tested negative on the standard Western Blot test, but this is apparently unsurprising given how long ago I would have been infected, so that doesn't actually rule out Lyme disease. So, it seems to me the real question is about the legitimacy of the other test: the CD57.


It is not recognized by the CDC or IDSA as a diagnostic tool for Lyme disease. But it is also true that many reputable doctors think the standard tests are lacking, and that, in fact, diagnosing Lyme disease is a bit of a mess. Other than that, I just haven't been able to find out much information about this test, either one way or the other.


So, I guess what I'm asking is: does anybody know anything about this test? Is it a legitimate test for diagnosing Lyme disease?",22,13,2011-05-18,PHARMA,0.1710473597049713,0.802112340927124,0.026840288192033768

This is mainly due to me freaking out and not conciously trying to figure out how large it was to begin with.  

I have two main questions:

1) How fast does Preparation H work?  Are they reduced back to non-existance or are they there forever?

2) Are there any other fast solutions for this?  

Can you guys give me any other tips?

Some details:

* I believe it's an external or a prolapsed internal hemmorrhoid.  

* It's on the outside of my body; I can push it in sometimes, but it comes back out.  

* It's about the size of a pea, maybe a little bigger.

* It's been present for over a week.  Preperation H has been applied for 2 days (this is the third day).",24,7,2011-05-18,PHARMA,0.09956043213605881,0.8726722002029419,0.02776733972132206

I thought I was a fairly healthy person, I don't stress thaaat much, I ate iron, Lysine drank water and even took medication to help. They all did nothing.

Health,I've cured my hyperhidrosis through diet change,"I said I'd leave an update if I did. I'm kind of tired, but thanks to a fellow redditor's advice on a diet change it worked. I'm to lazy to retype, but here's a copy pasta from [this post](http://www.socialphobiaworld.com/ive-found-a-cure-for-myself-might-help-others-33745/#post444232) on a forum in order to see if it helps anyone else out. Should pretty much explain everything.

tl;dr Don't eat tomatoes, potatoes, peppers (not peppercorn though), and eggplant for 2 months and your condition may improve or vanish completely.

I have hardly seen anything about this, so I guess it's not too well known. I'd like to thank ""biodebugger"" on reddit for helping me out on this.

What do I do?:In short, don't eat anything from the nightshade family and your hh will improve, if not completely go away within 1-2 months. This primarily includes potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers (but not peppercorn afaik). Here is a more complete list of things to avoid, but I haven't strickly followed it, mostly just avoiding the 3 things I mentioned before, but I could just never have eaten many due to my diet. If anyone has any specific questions in regards to my own diet I'll try my best to answer.

Why it works: Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding of it is this. The aforementioned paper is where I am getting this from, and thus would be a better and more thorough reference, but I'll try to give a quick explanation.

Some foods we commonly eat, namely those in the nightshade family, contain a chemical called alpha-solanine. Once in our body alpha-solanine acts as a cholinesterase inhibitor. Cholinesterase breaks down and metabolises acetycholine which is responsible for sweating, and muscle movement. If you also have twitching problems or arthiritus this may also be linked to it (though I've done far less research on that, next to none). This chemical cannot be metabolized by our bodies, as such it has a half life of 1-2 months, you probably will not see result for at least a month, if not two.

My experience: I have had hyperhidrosis for, as far as I can remember, around 10 years. I didn't know what it was called for at least 5, I don't really know what I thought, but I almost always tried to wear a jacket or something. I'd sweat on my hands, feet, and underams the most, but I actually sweat all over, just not in 'uncomfortable' amounts.

I'm tired, so I'll just make it brief. I came across this idea, about 6 months ago maybe, but due to very little support, and potatoes and tomatoes in particular being very hard to avoid, I didn't try it for awhile. A little while back I decided to do it and after about 4 weeks my hands dried up significantly, now they are completely dry, and so did my underarms. I believe I started it at the beginning of April and I accidentally ate some corn dogs last week with potato flower which made it come back for 2 or 3 days as well as possibly any and all of 2 slices of pizza, some BBQ, and some bean soup (tomato paste) the week before, which may have made me sweat up to a week or slightly more. I have not been very thorough as you can see.

I can provide some more information late if anyone is interested. I also came across a report by someone I think was a dr claiming this to help with a significant portion of his patients arthitus as well. I haven't done anymore research on that. Also came across someone mentioning (someone uncredible I might add, just forum speculation) this as a possible theory to why asian women don't experience hot flashes during menopause. I mention that specifically mostly because I often would have hot flashes, it felt as though my body did not know what temperature it was, which in it's own way made things worse than simply sweating.

Last thing I wanted to mention, and I have seen it mentioned once elsewhere, though I cannot remember where, is for myself I would sweat the most between 11am and 8pm. It seems to correlate with my activity/metobolic rate perhaps. At night (10pm-~morning) it was not uncommon for me to not sweat at all. I recently noticed, now that I'm looking for it (corndogs for instance) that when I eat something that day I will sweat that night. I've had many night (fastfood I would guess) where I would wake up in a cold sweat too, theoretically because I have higher levels of this stuff in me.",1,7,2011-05-23,PHARMA,0.10573163628578186,0.8689250946044922,0.02534322626888752

medicine,"Meddit, tell me about your ethically challenging experiences.","Details intentionally vague for privacy reasons.

One of my most unpleasant experiences in medicine happened recently.  I'd been looking after a young man, under 30 years old, with both a mental health disease and a physical ailment requiring an amputation.  Due to his psychiatric history, this fellow is legally cared for by a civil servant who acts as his power of attorney.

The ethical challenge comes from the fact that he did not want the amputation.  This is the culmination of a long-standing problem for this patient; multiple surgeons had seen him and universally agreed that amputation was the only reasonable treatment.

In addition to his pre-existing declaration of incompetence, we had two psychiatric consultations, both of which agreed that the patient was not competent to make medical decisions.

Despite **knowing** that there was no other treatment option, and despite knowing that this patient had **three times** been declared incompetent, it was and still is emotionally taxing to have tell this young patient - who was quite alert and oriented and appropriate - that regardless of what he wants, he is going to lose his limb.

I don't know what could have been done differently; I suspect nothing.  However, I do know that in this case, the best medical management and the appropriate medical-legal maneuvering was not enough to make it feel okay.  This will never feel like a success.

Health,My brother has a pathogen that is attacking his brain and doctors dont know how to fix him.,"My first post here as my brother lies severely drugged laying next to me in his hospital bed. Maybe a Neurologist will see this and chime in cause my brother needs all the help he can get.

It all started 3 weeks ago when he was working in the Dominican Republic. He was working on wiring speakers, the wires had to be run through a garden and buried. My brother has a form of psoriasis fingers (this is little skin cracks on his fingers) and didnt use gloves to dig and bury the wires.

After arriving back home in Vancouver BC Canada he developed severe headaches and was really confused. He went to the hospital and they told him that he might have Meningitis. They did a spinal tap and gave him some antibiotics and sent him home to recover. After a couple days sitting at home it got worse, so he went back and they told him to go back home and rest. This happened 3 more times. After 3 weeks he was unable to function and his wife had to call 911.

Now my brother lays in his hospital bed, New Neurologist still dont know what it is but think its some sort of Pathogen contracted from the soil in the Dominican. They did an MRI and found abscess all over my brothers brain and doctors gave him a 50% chance of survival. Right now he is going for another CT scan to see if they can gain any more info. Im posting here to see if anyone has ever heard of experienced anything like this. Please if there is anyone that can help my brother or any information you can offer it will be greatly appreciated. He was just blessed with a new baby boy and its too soon for him to be leaving us.

Health,"Day 3 of hiccups, wtf?  Yes, I've googled this, but 
have you ever had this experience?  I would like to 
know what they might be from.  Details inside.","This started on Thursday.  I get hiccups when I clear my throat.  It has always happened, but the hiccups usually last about 5 minutes (pretty normal).  This time, however, they haven't stopped.  Apparently this is called persistent hiccups, which have several causes.  Here are some details about my situation, and maybe you can help me pinpoint the source.

* When I get pretty hungry (growling stomach status), I get gassy and tend to burp.  So, apparently I get a gas buildup when my stomach is empty.
* I started working out hard again for a few months now and eating less than usual, so this hunger occurs more frequently.  I also completed a week of a boot camp fitness course last week.  No I'm not starving myself, I am just eating lighter in general.  This may be causing imbalances in important chemicals in my body that are causing the hiccups.  Yes, I am drinking large amounts of water.
* I *never* eat fast food, but on Wednesday night I thought ""What the hell"" and got a Jack-in-the-Box Spicy Chicken sandwich.  With all the intense working out I figured I need to get my carbs in as I am trying to bulk up more than the lean build that I have.  So, my body may be reacting to this type of food (bleh).
* I tried several ""remedies"" so far, but they have failed.  I'm concerned that the cause of my hiccups are now not the usual causes.
* Last night I came down with some heartburn, or possibly acid reflux.  After eating each bite of my sandwich, my chest would hurt for a moment a few seconds later.  I have only had heartburn twice since I can remember, so it's not normal for me to have it.
* A TAD GRAPHIC: Yes, I tried the gag remedy.  I threw up and my vomit was very dark.  I'm not used to seeing red vomit, so I don't think it registered that it could have been blood.  My dad happened to ask me if I was throwing up blood, and it gave me an ""oh crap"" moment.  I may have have blood in my vomit.
* This morning I was hiccupping the moment I woke up.  After a couple bites of cereal, the hiccups stopped for about an hour but have returned since.  I joined a friend for breakfast but had no troubling eating or swallowing (no heartburn or acid reflux).

Those are details off the top of my head for now.  Please ask me any questions you feel are helpful.  I'm growing concerned, even after my dad asked me questions that sound similar to my problem.  Thanks for the help.

PS - Yes, I am calling the doctor and setting up an appointment.  However, I would like to hear some experiences, or from people who specialize in [related areas].

**Edit 01:** Another point added, possibly relevant.

**Edit 02:  **UPDATE (5/30): Yesterday I got a few hiccup attacks (for a total of 4 days), but the intervals between were getting longer.  I took this as a good sign, and I believe the Prilosec OTC helped.  Today I haven't had any hiccups, except for a single one when I cleared my throat (as usual).  Right now it feels as if they can come back easily, I just need to avoid all possible triggers.  It looks as if they're fading away, so perhaps I had a case of acid reflux?  My follow-up questions are:

1) I noticed my hiccups went away for a bit after eating breakfast (cereal &amp; eggs).  Could the dairy have helped relieve the hiccups at all?

2)  Additionally, is it possible that I have thrown off a chemical balance due to my heavier workout routine?  There has been mention of damage to the phrenic nerve.  Could I have done this during a workout, and is there any way I could have strained anything during my workout to cause this?",21,15,2011-05-28,PHARMA,0.07759062200784683,0.8900501728057861,0.03235923871397972

medicine,Calling all Med Students! I'd like your insights.,"* Good morning /r/Medicine! So long story short, I run one of the pre-med groups at my university, and I am in the process of making a (for lack of a better term) Pre-Med 101 guidebook for the new underclassmen that will be joining us next fall. Basically, it's just a compilation of insights and opinions about the path to medical school. It's very informal, and all that's required of you is to answer a short survey that I wrote up. 

* If you are interested in contributing, please PM me your email, and I will send you a copy. Aside from current med students, med students-to-be and (if there are any floating around out here) residents/fellows/attendings  are welcome! Also, if you know of any other students, etc. that would be interested in filling out a survey, feel free to send them a copy.

Thanks,
