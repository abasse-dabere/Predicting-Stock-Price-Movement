medicine,Mad Max's Blood Type,"Just something really neat I noticed during my second run of watching the amazing mad max fury road. 

For those of you who haven't seen the movie, the protagonist, max, is used as a walking transfusion blood bank for some of the villains in the show who are presumably suffering from post radiation induced bone marrow failure (nuclear fallout, etc). 

In the movie we see max constantly hooked up to Nux as his 'blood bag', and we also see max giving Furiousa a field transfusion after he decompresses her tension pneumothorax. 

Now at the start of the movie there's a mechanic like dude who's tattooing max, and he tattoos Blood type O- on his back. Hence universal blood donor.

medicine,"Sometimes when I am bored, when it is all sore throats and dental pains, when I feel more like I am a social worker and a hand-holder than an emergency medicine physician, I play a game.","[***Please note the following is fiction***]

I do not look at the chart before I go into a room. I walk in cold. I enter with no idea who is going to be in there or why. In that very first second, before anyone speaks, I try to guess what the story is, who the people in the room are, and why they are in my emergency room.

Here—maybe it would make more sense if I showed you.

I draw back the curtain and step into Trauma Room Two. My eyes scan quickly about, gathering as much information as they can.

There are three people in the room.

For a brief second, I intentionally do not look at the patient lying on the hospital bed, not yet. Two people accompany the patient, a man and a woman. The man sits on a hard plastic chair pushed back against the room’s wall, staring quietly ahead. I start with him. I know if I can just look closely enough, the story is there.

I study him. He is in his late forties. He wears a jet-black business suit. The fine fabric lies starkly against a bright, white, collared dress shirt. The dress shirt is pressed and starched and clean. He shifts slightly in the chair, and the red silk tie around his neck catches the light just so, drawing my eye to it. Small square gold icons fill the tie in an exact and set pattern. The knot at the top is tied with perfect precision and symmetry. This means something. I look more closely.

On his left wrist, he wears a Rolex. The bands are polished silver and cradle an oyster-white face on which three hands mark the time, the smallest of which ticks along, second by second by second. The outside of the watch face is meticulously trimmed in gold and clearly asserts to all who see it that this man’s time is expensive.

As I observe, he moves his wrist a fraction of an inch, and the whole thing explodes into shimmers, sparkling magnificently from just the weak fluorescent lights overhead. It dawns on me that his watch alone costs more than the car I drove to work this morning. I cannot help but think, “This man is nothing like me.”

I have learned I have to be careful with people like him. A single misstep in our interaction can easily result in a long string of complaint letters. But it is OK. I have done this enough that it does not frighten me or anger me or even annoy me. It is just a dance I have to be conscious of in this room. I make a mental note to be careful, and then continue my study.

Atop his head sits black hair with just a dusting of silver—executive hair, I believe it is called. It is thick and full and glowing with virility. Every strand is carefully combed into place. His hair shines nearly as brightly as his watch.

He lifts his head just slightly to look at me, and I notice a tiny cluster of hair is out of place. Just above and behind his left ear, the small bunch breaks from the linear strands around it, twisting up in disarray. It is not much, but it is there. On a man like him, it is nothing and everything at the same time. 

Something is wrong.

His face is clean-shaven, the skin healthy and bright. Two black, sharp, crisp Italian eyebrows sit above pale blue, intelligent eyes that read me in a glance, as quickly as I read him. A strong jaw cuts the angle of his face into the space of the room around it. He does not need to smile for me to know his teeth will be perfect and symmetrical and white.

Under each eye hangs a faint dark circle. He has not been sleeping well. I am guessing, of course, but it looks to be more than just work fatigue. Perhaps a struggle outside of work has started to spill over into what must be an all-consuming drive for achievement. Or perhaps it is nothing other than the tracks left on him from another successful merger. I cannot tell—not yet.

It is strange to see someone like him here, even if he is just accompanying the patient. I am an ER doctor in a small emergency room, in a small hospital, in a small town, in the middle of nowhere. I can’t help but wonder how a man like him ends up in an ER out here so far from the city. He does not have the look of someone who has come to hunt or fish, and he is definitely no wheat farmer. But something has pulled him here from far away, something that could not wait. I look closer.

The lines, curves, and circles of his face come together into an expression that is hard, at first, for me to read. I can sense he is a master at controlling what his face reveals. But my job is to read faces and bodies as well as he reads the stock market. In the curve of his mouth, I read frustration. In the angle of his brow, I read anger. In the tilt of his head, I read even a trace of fear.

But there is something else—something he does not want anyone to see. He hides it so well, after so much practice and time, I almost miss it. In fact, I am sure I would have missed it when I first started out, 41,422 patients ago. But that was then.

There, like a single, delicate, fleeting strand woven through a cloth of steel, is a tenderness and a sadness. What it is doing inside a man like him—I cannot comprehend. I can see why he wants to—no, why he has to—hide it in his world. He works to obscure it in the glint of his eyes and the shine of what must be a string of brutal successes. But still it is there.

Now that I see it, I see it clearly. It has blindsided him like a flash flood in the spring, sweeping him off his feet and tossing him down a canyon from which he cannot escape. He is drowning in this maelstrom of sadness, and no amount of money, power, or rage against the universe can make it abate. 

An empty chair sits next to him.

One chair over is a woman.

She is slightly younger than the man.

I cannot see her face; her body is turned partially away from me.

She is resting her elbows on her knees, looking at the screen of her phone. She cradles it lovingly like a newborn. Marvelous red nails stand out against a white-and-gold iPhone. Her fingers are long and elegant like those of a famous pianist or a brain surgeon. She taps and slides the icons on the screen with elegance, as if they are servants being sent to do her bidding.

Her forearms are bare and hairless, but it is her biceps that stand out. They are small, solid, and precise, like an exclamation point stamped onto each upper arm. Biceps like that shout yoga, Pilates, personal trainers, green smoothies, and a lock on the bathroom door after big holiday meals.

Long brown hair is pulled back into a ponytail that falls gracefully to the middle of her back. A small silver clasp studded with diamonds traps the hair behind her head, holding it in place. It out-shimmers even the man’s Rolex.

She wears a light gold, silk shirt. There is a cutout in the top back of it. I can just barely see her upper spine under the skin. Each vertebra makes a small bump in the arch of her lower neck, and each one is the exact same distance from the one above and below it. There are no outliers, no overly large or overly small bones. Each rise in her skin is exactly the same size and distance from the other. Before this moment, I did not realize bones in a back could be so flawless.

The skin over the bones is a rich, deep tan. It glows from her vegan diet and vitamin regimen. As she taps her finger on the phone, little ripples appear in the muscles of her back. I cannot help but stare in awe of such royalty stopping in our humble town.

She, too, is obviously nothing like me.

On the floor by her feet sits a purse. Its handle is a bent half circle of bamboo attached with gold and silver clasps to the bag below. The bamboo is polished and smooth. The wood is a blend of browns. A creamy white winds through the handle, somehow offsetting the dark tones and grains of the wood.

The purse itself looks to my unsophisticated eye not unlike the color of a wet pack horse after it has crossed a deep stream. It is a different shade of brown from the bamboo. It is like no brown I have ever seen before. As I look more closely, I see it is a bright, full, radiant brown that I can only compare to the soil on the edge of town in the spring. Soil that is freshly turned and waiting for seeds to spring up from it with life. Silver clasps and bamboo buttons adorn the purse in a perfect harmony of style. But there is something else—something that strikes me as oddly awful, something that should never be.

The purse has fallen over. The perfect brown of its side rests against our faded linoleum floor. Its contents spill out under the chair, untouched.
 
My second is almost up.

Now, at last, I turn to the patient.

A man lies on the bed. The pointed toes of scuffed cowboy boots stick up like two sharp rocks in a field. Straw and dirt pepper them and have shaken off onto the sheets. A pair of old blue jeans covers the top of the boots. They, too, have brought pieces of the farm and fields into the ER.

The man is supposed to be in a hospital gown. All our patients are. But more often than not, men around here will refuse to take off their boots and jeans. Sometimes I walk into rooms, and cowboy hats still sit perched atop heads. It is just part of living in this corner of the world.

The thighs of his jeans are faded where he must wipe his hands when in the fields. He must be right-handed, as the right thigh is faded much more than the left. A thick, worn leather belt with a buckle the size of two fists holds up jeans on a waist that is much too skinny. 

The belt buckle is a flat grayish silver with an image stamped onto the front. A bronco bucks wildly, and a cowboy on top holds on with one hand strapped snug to the horse and the other in the air for balance. His hat is spiraling off his head into the air above him. “Pendleton Round-Up Champion 1942” is etched across the top, and the words “Let ’Er Buck” are below. In an odd way, I realize he, too, is nothing like me.

The man lies shirtless on the bed. The hairs of his chest are gray. A tattoo of marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima is inked just above his heart. The whole tattoo moves up and down with his gasping.

I look to his face.

It is tired and worn and ready to stop fighting. I see that multiple rounds of chemotherapy have taken all his hair, leaving behind nothing but eyebrows. His skin sags, and there is no light remaining in his eyes. They stare blankly ahead. Drops of sweat gather and cluster on his brow as I watch. The end is near.

The man and the woman stand up to join me at the bedside. The woman stands on one side, her diamond-clad hand gently resting on the old man’s shoulder. The man who came with her stands on the other, his strong fingers lovingly resting on the thick skin of the old man’s sunburnt neck. 

I look from face to face to face, and I am surprised to see tears falling on every single one. The tears roll past similar noses, shared chins, and pale blue eyes. The pieces fall into place before me.

A daughter and a son have come home to say good-bye to their father.

I watch as the brother and sister sit down on either side of the bed. The old man, still gasping for air, suddenly sees them. With a struggle, he lifts his arms. The brother and sister lean in against their father. He lowers his arms across their shoulders as if they are still children. They rest their heads against his, curling up against his bony frame while he pants and waits for the end.

Standing before them, it suddenly hits me.

I have made a terrible mistake.

They are all just like me.

medicine,"A sincere ""Thank You""... 36 years late.","Thirty-six years ago, I was a scared little boy. And you helped me.

.

But let's back up to the beginning of the story.

Thirty-six years ago, before I was that scared little boy, I was an impulsive little boy with a distinct lack of common sense. I suspect that this is a common set of traits for seven- and eight-year-old boys.

My older brother called to me to hurry up and see something exciting going on outside our apartment building. Looking back on the incident, I suspect it was just some construction workers doing something construction-y. But I dashed outside after my brother, so eager to see what had excited him that I didn't bother to put on my shoes.

So when I got to the street level, before I saw whatever construction-y thing I was supposed to see, I stepped on a rusty nail.

With no shoe to deflect or slow down that sharp piece of metal, it bit up into the arch of my foot close to 4cm (about 1.5 inches). The pain was unspeakable.

My parents rushed me to the hospital of course, and luckily the nail did no major damage to the long-term functions of my foot. I had to get a tetanus shot, and that is when I met you.

You were the nurse assigned to give me that shot, and I was terrified - probably because I'd just experienced a sharp piece of metal shoved into my tender, tender flesh. You were perfectly calm, of course; I might say that you were coolly professional, but on that day, you went above and beyond the call of duty.

You took a small square of cool, wet something and wiped my upper arm with it. Tears were streaming down my face, and I'm sure I was shivering with fright.

""What's that?"" I asked.

""It's an alcohol swab,"" you said.

""What's it for?"" I was hoping for some numbing medication before the shot.

""It cleans your arm so you don't get an infection from the needle,"" you said.

And just like that, I realized that you really knew what you were doing, and if I had any other questions you would answer them without treating me like the panicking kid that I was.

I am pretty sure that I never saw you again after that day. But your words and your manner stuck with me over the decades. Nurses and med techs often do the most thankless jobs, from giving injections to screaming kids to changing bedpans and everything in between.

And it's not just the medical professionals either. It's the construction workers risking their health so we can have shiny new buildings; it's the trash collectors who haul other people's filth away so our homes and streets stay clean; it's the teachers who put up with low pay and obnoxious regulations for the chance to make the next generation of panicking kids a little smarter and wiser.

I have no clear idea what you looked like 36 years ago; you are probably somewhere in your 60s now. I want you to know that eventually I went into a field tangental to medical care, and my respect for all the techs and nurses and doctors has never ebbed.

So **thank you**... all of you.",18,149,2015-10-07,PHARMA,0.08381517976522446,0.8876811265945435,0.028503693640232086

medicine,A previously unrecognized danger of metformin,"So I had a patient come in yesterday to my ED who had accidentally taken her daughters metformin. She though it was her Tykenol#3. So the charge nurse says there's this lady who's being over dramatic because she took one metformin tab and instantly felt it get stuck in her esophagus, felt a sharp pain and is now unable to swallow anything. 

I got to see her he's spitting up her saliva, apparently can't even keep that down. Her  Vitals were  normal and she was in no real distress. Able to speak to me normally but just unable to swallow anything, even tried sips of water. 

I planned to use the Fiber optic rhinoscope to take a look but had a ctas 1 come in so instead paged GI who was not impressed with the 1 metformin stuck story. I told him the she's not even swallowing her saliva so I'd much rather he take a look. 

So a few hours later I see on my patient list that this lady is going for a CT. I think “that's weird “ and take a look. I see the rad report
"" pneumomediastinum/pneumoretroperitoneum and right sided pneumothorax"". 

At this point I rush to see the patient and run into the GI doc who tells me that he saw the pill still stick couldn't get it out abs had to push it down but the area where it was stuck was very red with some bleeding and looked like a possible perforation. 

The patient in the mean time is still sitting comfortably with normal vitals and normal labs and is now being monitored in the ICU.

medicine,Conservative NS infusion to raise blood pressure? (X-post from r/ems) (OP is a paramedic and a hopeful student of medicine).,"Many times I have had the pleasure of treating patients presenting with the sort of symptoms typical of that of acute hypotension either arising from vasovagal syncope, anaphylaxis, shock, arrhythmia, or of a less obvious etiology. NS infusion, as I understand, is called for when not contraindicated and is meant to be a supportive measure as a going concern of hemodynamic collapse. Since I work in an urban setting however I rarely get to see more than 400-700 cc infused; but it has not been, in my anecdotal experience, on rare occasion that I find my patient's blood pressure returned to normal range upon arrival at the ED.

Unless I specifically treated the cause of the hypotension, for example by pushing antiarrhythmics or treating anaphylaxis, I assume that if their blood pressure has risen then it must be due to intrinsic physiologic mechanisms at work.

Many of my coworkers however believe that NS infusions as meager as 100-500 cc are the sole reason that a patient's previously low blood pressure has returned to normal range. I just cannot imagine this being the case. Based on the volume of fluid normally present in the cardiovascular system, and the mixture of which with the body's ability to regulate homeostasis, I find it hard to believe that that 500 cc or even 1000 cc can make a major impact on volume status as regarding hypotension.

Unfortunately, the long hours spent standing has resulted in significant back pain - to the point where I am unable to scrub in for cases because the pain is unbearable.
The pain is spasmodic and I suspect it is muscular in origin as I haven't really had to stand for extended periods prior to this rotation.
I have started wearing sneakers as per recommendations by colleagues, and although they have improved the pain somewhat, it hasn't eliminated it.
I have managed to survive so far by strategically leaning against walls/counters/operating table before I am required to stand unassisted again.

Has anyone had similar problems and how did you deal with it? Can I expect this to resolve or will it continue?

medicine,Helmet removal in trauma confusion,"For a long time the standard in trauma medicine and EMS from sports to motorcycle accidents was to never remove the helmet from a patient's involved in head trauma. 

There was some wiggle room if the airway was compromised before the most part it was felt that it was too likely to do spinal damage to a patient when removing the helmet.

Personally and with the more forward thinking physicians that I work with the most important topic was always airway management, it didn't matter if there was a possibility of compromising the spine if the patient was unable to breathe.

Some of the more recent backboard and c-spine studies seem to have shown that the likelihood of spinal compromised was greater when trying to help manage those injuries with such devices vs letting the patient find their own level of comfort while keeping them in a state of fixation through verbal commands versus manually stabilizing them.

Hence we've rightly seen backboards start disappearing from EMS agencies as an immediate ""treatment"" for traumas. 

Today a new article was released in Jems that seems to backup the old method, leave the helmet on unless the worse case scenario of airway issues.

http://www.jems.com/articles/print/volume-40/issue-10/features/prehospital-treatment-of-athletes-wearing-a-helmet-and-shoulder-pads.html?cmpid=jemsnowenl10132015&amp;eid=313315590&amp;bid=1202763

However this seems to conflict with the current literature on actual spinal damage being much less prevalent and perhaps increased if the patient is not kept in a comfortable position.

Also the famous and unfortunately now passed Dr John Hinds, who was an expert in the management of high speed motorcycle trauma, was an advocate of quickly removing the helmet while keeping the patient in a neutral position and allowing them to maintain a level of comfort.

At my current hospital, if a doc started an IV, administered a medication, changed a dressing, inserted a Foley, etc. s/he would probably get reamed out by the charge for doing ""nursing tasks"", and probably chewed out by his/her attending for not getting caught up on charting. 

On the other hand, if a medicine intern or even a PGY2 did something like inserting a central line (IR does them here) or tapping an abdomen (procedures team), they might get the side eyes from those departments.

Obviously this isn't the case everywhere, but it's interesting to me that particularly in medicine, we have gone from ""they'll fire you if you let the nurses do it"" to ""they'll fire you if don't let the nurses do it"" in the span of like 10 or 15 years.

&gt; But it's a cost that concerns groups like the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. In 2013, pointing to research and polls showing that the use of metrics tend to increase errors, the NABP asked states to restrict, regulate or prohibit their use.

&gt; So what about Texas?

&gt; The I-Team did an interview with Gay Dodson, the executive director of the Texas State Board of Pharmacy.

&gt; During that talk, she made a surprising statement.

medicine,I'm a doctor with MS - do I tell my colleagues?,"Hi all!

I'm a 27F junior doctor, and I was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis this year. From a medical standpoint, I've currently got annoying sensory symptoms but no disability and I'm being wonderfully cared for by an MS specialist service. 

Obviously I was very distressed by my diagnosis, but my neurologist has advised me that I should absolutely continue on with my medical career as planned and keep the same goals and aspirations I had before. Fortunately, I have not needed any time off sick since my diagnosis and have no physical or cognitive impairments that impede my work. I am pleased to say the standard of my work and enthusiasm toward it has not changed at all!

Upon my neurologist's advice, I informed my managers at my hospital about my diagnosis and they have been nothing but discreet and supportive about it, which was a huge relief.

The reason I am posting here is essentially to canvas opinion on whether I should 'come out' about my diagnosis to my friends and colleagues? I have told a select few friends (medical and non-medical), including a few at work who I trust to be non-judgmental and private. 

I do, however, feel extremely anxious about what can and will happen when it becomes widely known amongst my colleagues. As we all know, the medical community can be very insular and gossip spreads fast. I am extremely worried that it will affect my colleagues' opinions of me - that they'll feel sorry for me, or think I can't do my job, or think I'm not a good candidate for specialty training programmes and jobs, etc. I am aware of a handful of other medical professionals in my local area who also have MS, though I don't know any of them personally. In fact, I don't personally know anyone with MS.

So - what do you think? Would it be awful if/when my colleagues found out? Does anyone here have any similar experiences they can share?

Many thanks in advance for your thoughts :) 

EDIT: Wow, I'm really impressed by the response here. Thanks everyone for all your input so far. 

As some of you have picked up on, the main reason I am considering the pros and cons of making my diagnosis openly known is because I find it extremely stressful that I have to constantly worry about being accidentally found out, or having a person I've confided in slip my secret out. I do wonder if it would be better if I controlled the flow of information about it, rather than having it accidentally passed around as gossip one day. As many of you probably find, so many of my friends are doctors (many of whom I work with directly) that the cost of actually getting to tell all my friends and be open about it is that it will leak around to the rest of my local colleagues as well. I can't even attend any local support groups or events because I'm so worried about having my privacy violated or running into someone I know. And indeed, as some of you have also pointed out, I may not able to hide my symptoms forever. It's also difficult to come up with such a myriad of excuses when I need to sneak away for medical appointments! 

I guess the main things I worry about are: 
a) That people will feel sorry for me and go too easy on me (ugh), or worry that I'm delicate and sensitive or too affected by my emotions.
b) That it will affect people's trust in my judgement - eg. that errors which are normal and expected will be mistakenly attributed to a neurological problem rather than just being recognised as your average junior doctor mistakes - which would be devastating, because I'm a damn good junior doctor.
c) That people will think I don't have long-term career potential and I'm not worth investing time and training into (which is complete bullshit).

In response to a few comments about licensing, etc., the medical board where I live does not require you to notify them of health conditions unless they are actually actively detrimental to your ability to practice medicine. Mine is not. It might cause impairments in the future, in which case I would certainly notify them, or it may never impede my ability to practice. I was actually quite conscious of this issue and sought opinions from two MS specialists on whether I should notify the medical board, and they both advised it was not necessary.

medicine,valid uses of these ICD-10-CM codes?,"There are so many cool ICD-10-CM codes now in use in the USA that I feel they deserve to at least be used sometimes. What do you all think about the validity of the uses of the following codes in the following situations?

1. W55.89XA Other contact with other mammals, initial encounter - I have been using this code when part of the reason for the visit includes having been in contact with another human that is not covered elsewhere, such as ""patient has white coat hypertension and now has high reading because he is in contact with me"" or ""patient has a 4 month old infant at home so especially needs to have their flu shot done"" or ""teacher who works with lots of kids"".

2. X39.8XXA Other exposure to forces of nature, initial encounter - I have been using this code for anyone who fell, since gravity is a force of nature and is at least partly contributing to the patient's injury.

3.  W90.8XXA  Exposure to other nonionizing radiation, initial encounter - For patients who have a sunburn, since it is specifically the UV radiation (more specific than just sunlight) that caused the injury.

4. Z02.89  Encounter for other administrative examinations - for visits requiring conversion of ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 codes, as this is part of the public health component of the visit.

Edit: UV radiation is non-ionizing. I may have to submit some claim corrections now too.",52,152,2015-10-22,PHARMA,0.07839377969503403,0.8985626697540283,0.023043585941195488

pharmacy,Nurses crushing potentially toxic meds?,"I'm an RN and something that happened at a facility where I used to work has been bothering me...

We had a couple of long-term patients on finasteride and anastrozole and the nursing staff were required to crush these meds (with a silent knight in the med room) and administer via PEG tube. When I first encountered these meds, I looked them up and was concerned about the potential toxicity, especially to women of child-bearing age. We had lots of pregnant or trying to conceive nurses. I called our staff pharmacist and asked if it was appropriate that we be crushing it and it was brushed off and he said ""it's fine"". I brought it up with the director of pharmacy, who also brushed it off.

So I (with the support of my fellow staff RNs) decided to escalate it up the nursing chain of command. This led to a new complex policy where pharmacy delivered the meds in a liquid form and the oral syringe needed to be disposed of in a special container. Nurses were offered free health exams. The director of pharmacy resigned (and gave me evil looks every time I saw her). I was suddenly on administration's radar and they were on me for every little thing. I decided to leave for another job, they originally said I could stay on per diem, but when I actually pursued it, they wouldn't allow it. 

I'm wondering if my concerns were legit or if I overreacted and was just a major pain in the ass for all involved.",22,38,2015-10-22,PHARMA,0.15046964585781097,0.8223938345909119,0.027136512100696564

medicine,"When I am one of ""the girls"" instead of one of the Doctors.","I've been a Doctor for four years, and as a female have gotten quite used to a small but steady undercurrent of skepticism and dismissal because of my gender. I'm not phased and it doesn't affect my job.

However a very simple comment a few days ago from a nurse in radiology has left me pondering. I was attending a thyroid biopsy, with another senior pathology registrar, and the nurse introduced us to the patient as ""the girls"". We are both adult women in our 20's who have been working for a number of years as full-time doctors. When the male radiologist walked in he was introduced as ""the doctor"" and the patient's attention was noticeably different. ""The girls"" were just background even though we both have roles in these types of biopsies.

This is a double edged issue perhaps as I have recently switched registrar training from Intensive Care to Pathology, and even some other medical professionals don't fully understand what we do. I noticed the change quite quickly in how people treat you, but again am not very bothered - medicine in general is poorly understood by the general population and there are often a lot of inaccurate preconceptions held in people's minds no matter what specialty it is.

But, while reflecting on this simple comment, I realised when I was in intensive care and as a junior doctor in other departments, the difference in how you are treated as a female compared with your male colleagues can be stark. Older patients often are noticeably confused when you introduce yourself and role. People outside of the hospital often look at you with skepticism and ask dismissive comments like ""Oh so you must just be a GP then?"" or, ""Are you a real doctor, or are you a nurse?"" (Not that there is anything wrong with being a GP or nurse!)

But when your colleagues introduce you as ""the girl"" or ""the girls"", patients get confused, they get less comfortable and they misunderstand the situation. I know it's a cultural thing to continue referring to adult women as ""girls"" but at what point do you correct this? Should I have corrected this nurse? Politely explained that I'm an adult woman and a doctor, and that it can be confusing for patients if only the male doctors are referred to as such?

I'd love to hear other people's perspectives on this.",111,205,2015-10-25,PHARMA,0.0950842946767807,0.8797643184661865,0.025151431560516357

medicine,The Feels: When it hits close to home,"Just wanted to share a story meddit.

Today I had a patient cuss me out and threaten physical harm for not prescribing morphine 100mg BID #90 pills at a time and oxy 15mg #180 that his pain doc was giving him previously. The reason he was in my office was because his pain doc was shut down by the fed about a month ago. 

This on top of the patients that came in an our late and still argued that I made them wait, the alcoholic who has no desire to quit, the patient in denial that he truly does have diabetes and  his A1c of 13 is really his blood and was not mixed up by the lab. 

I thought my day was tough, came home and told my girlfriend how mentally done I was, acted all dramatic and went to lay down.

Suddenly I am laying on my bed and my ex is calling me.. i cant help but wonder why. As a little aside, she was diagnosed with breast cancer at 31 and went through chemo 4 years ago. since her cancer free diagnosis we parted ways and were with new people as we were just different people after it was all over. Well she had her follow up visit with her oncologist today and told me that the doctor told her ""its everywhere lighting up like a Christmas tree, including the spine."" (sounds like her oncologist could work on her bedside manner)

I know we all have our own personal battles and day to day frustrations but this really hit it home that each of my patients had their own struggles today and I shouldn't get frustrated. I'm glad I can help in what little way I sometimes do. I listened d to her come to realize her life is coming to an end and it was one of the saddest conversations I've ever had. She remains positive about her life left and remains such an inspiration in my life. I feel blessed that we had such an impact on each others lives for the short time we were together. 

I love what I do and sometimes I have these little reminders of how lucky my life truly is that I was able to follow a profession that I always wanted to be apart of and can help people at all stages in their illness.

medicine,"[Discussion] When an inexperienced intern faces a situation where a patient must be operated on or face certain death, should the intern risk losing his career (due to failure) or abstain from performing the operation?","We had a discussion inspired by the movie [Gifted Hands](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1295085/) regarding one event in the story where Ben Carson, as an intern, faces a situation where all the neurosurgeons are away, and a patient will die unless someone does something. 

Carson chooses to perform the procedure and is successful. He is not held accountable for breaking code and performing without permission or supervision.
Is this a common thing to happen? What is the 'right' thing to do?


Some people were of the opinion that one should follow the rules and guidelines and not perform without permission or supervision because if the operation were a failure there would certainly be medicolegal consequences.

medicine,"""There's no reason to ever place a subclavian central line.""","Or so an internal medicine colleague said today. I'm an ED resident and had a conversation with a couple IM residents today who were covering the ICU. They were complaining about having to deal with thoracostomy tube dysfunction on a patient of theirs who was recently admitted for septic shock complicated by an pneumothorax caused by subclavian line insertion. Understandably, they blamed the ED physicians for causing said pneumo, but went on to wonder why anybody would ever feel the need to put in a subclavian line, arguing that (medically) emergent lines can be ""blind"" femoral lines, and any urgent lines can be sono-guided IJ (or femoral) lines. The risks for each line location have been debated since forever, but they argued that pneumo/hemothoraces are such a severe complication that they should preclude the use of SC lines, period.

Helpfully, there was a [recent paper](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1500964) that looked at the complications of each line, but I was wondering what the good folks of meddit think. I've certainly had oddball cases that required a subclavian line, but I suppose for a good majority of my SC lines one could argue that a nice and sterile fem line would be just as good, what do you guys think? Should subclavians go the way of the landmark-guided IJ?

pharmacy,Why this Rite Aid + Walgreens merger will be very bad for pharmacy / pharmacists,"So by now you've heard that walgreens has agreed to purchase rite aid for over $17B, but have you considered the impact of this merger on our industry? Probably based on the discussions in the other thread.


Now the merger is coming under fire from anti-trust regulators. Usually they don't straight up deny a merger, but often they will let it go through under certain conditions. In this case, the condition will likely be that they promise to close a certain number of stores by a certain date. If I had to guess I'd say 1,000 stores.

* This merger will lead to more pharmacists looking for jobs then there already are.

* there is no other chain to fill the void of stores, not that they would want to as the sold/closed stores will likely be lower profit locations

* walgreens has had to take on a lot of debt for this transaction and their most recent earnings report (yesterday) reflects issues in their future

* so both major chains will be loaded with debt, looking to cut costs in anyway possible

* there wont be any room for growth or the anti-trust conditions may not be met

* this could speed up the downturn in salary

pharmacy,What would you do?,"I work as a technician for CVS and last night a woman rushed into our pharmacy holding her child. The child was experiencing anaphylaxis due to an existing peanut allergy. The pharmacist first pulled up the patient's profile while another technician called 911. She quickly refilled his Epipen prescription and counseled the mother on the directions. The frantic mother was reluctant and insisted the pharmacist administer the medication. The pharmacist explained that this was out of her scope of practice, but agreed after being give consent by the mother. The boys condition immediately improved. The EMTs arrived and transported the boy to the local emergency room. 

After the incident we returned back to our normal routine. About an hour later a man came to the pharmacy asking to speak to the pharmacist. This man was the boy's father, the one who gave the child the peanut containing product. He was angry and began yelling at the pharmacist. He told the pharmacist that his son did not have a peanut allergy, and that he did not require medical attention. And that the use of medication to treat a nonexistent condition could have harmed his son. (However, the child was visibly not okay.) He ended his tirade by asking the pharmacist if she was legally allowed to administer these types of medications, to which she replied, ""no"". He stormed off, and I could tell the pharmacist was visibly shaken.

After collecting her thoughts, she called the mother who was now at home with her sleeping son. The mother confirmed that the boy does have a peanut allergy and explained that her husband (the boy's father) refuses to believe this. The boy's allergist as well as his PCP have attempted to explain the severity of the allergy to the father, with no success. The mother insured that he would take no legal action, and she was extremely grateful for the pharmacist's help. 

To be safe the pharmacist reluctantly called our district manager and explained the situation. Fortunately, he praised her for her actions, and related an experience where he illegally dispensed an albuterol inhaler to a patient who was having an asthma attack. The pharmacist felt much better that the DM had her back. 

This morning the patient and his mother came in to fill prescriptions that were given by the hospital. When the mother saw the pharmacist again she burst into tears and gave her a hug. The boy looked up at the pharmacist and said, ""thank you.""

This was a profound experience for the pharmacist, who has worked in retail for many years. She is still concerned about her conversation with the boys father, but is happy with the choices she made that night. Personally, I believe she made the right moral choice despite a potential legal issue. 

What would you do? Should there be laws in place to protect pharmacist in emergency situations that require administering a potentially life saving medication with or without a prescription? Some examples that come to mind are epinephrine, abuterol inhalers, narcan and glucagon kits.

X-Ray shows a metallic foreign body, probably a needle, in the right upper quadrant. ER doc thinks he swallowed it and sends him to CT. CT shows that the needle is lodged partly in the right renal vein, partly in the IVC. IR removes it - it is a 5 cm sewing needle.  

Patient has no idea how it got there.
