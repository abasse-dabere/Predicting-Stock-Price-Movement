An unofficial survey based on specialty, experience, and location.","The subject of physician salary has come up multiple times in this meddit. I'm conducting an unofficial survey, and I was hoping attendings or physicians who graduated residency and primarily have patient care responsibilities can report what they make. I'm hoping to get enough information so people can compare not only compensation by specialty, but by experience and location. It wasn't too long ago that I started being an attending and was really wishing I could get an idea about average salary for those just starting out in my specialty to use as a starting point to negotiate a salary. The [medscape compensation report](http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/compensation/2015/public/overview#page=1) report and things like it help. But they don't provide important information like how much people are making when starting out now and how much people are making in major metropolitan areas. I'm hoping to get enough results so that people graduating and thinking about specialties in certain areas can get a ballpark estimate of what they should be making. If you have the time, please fill out my survey. Please fill it out only once and as accurately as possible. The suvery is completely anonymous. Thanks!

A 52 year old gentleman with a history of osteoarthritis, peptic ulcer and pacer (""for heart beats not being picked up"", leading to syncope, he is unsure of the make/model/mode and no records in our system) suffered a fall while fishing and fractured his humerus.  He was admitted for surgery.  On the day of surgery [this was his ECG](http://i.imgur.com/qpFqIkt.jpg).

Surgery was uneventful, EBL was 100-200 cc.  All vitals had been steady and HR had been in the 80-90s.  Pain was controlled well with nerve block and PRN opioids.  About 3 hours after leaving the PACU, his HR jumped to the 120s where it was sustained, all other vital signs remained stable.  This was in the setting of eating a hoagie sandwich and he had no symptoms whatsover (including no pain, chest pain/pressure, SOB, feeling his heart race, etc...).  The orthopedist on call asked for a medicine consult.

I ordered a 500 cc NS bolus and [repeat ECG](http://i.imgur.com/GH9ml0P.jpg).  Before I had arrived at the bedside (and before the NS) his HR had dropped back to the 80s.  Remained completely asymptomatic.

medicine,Any books or blogs about the process of opening a medical clinic?,"A friend and I have been discussing the idea of opening a medical clinic as a side project to supplement our main incomes (EM shifts).

We live in a part of the world were there are many opioid-dependent people.  Our plan is to apply for buprenorphine waivers and start treating outpatients with suboxone.  Every shift I work reminds me of just how urgent it is that these people receive help;  there are too many children and young adults dying pointlessly from overdoses and injection drug related disease every week.  The first year, we're limited to a 30 patient census each, so our plan is to run close to the ground and then scale up when we apply for a waiver to increase our patient census to 100 each after the second year.

That said, neither of us have experience with running an outpatient clinic since we have only worked as full-time EM physicians in a group that covers all the administrative tasks.  We hope to keep it simple by going cash only and working with a small staff (probably just a single receptionist/CNA/LPN).  We hope to rent an office space or clinic in a cheap strip mall as there are many affordable rentals nearby.

I'm not really asking for opinions regarding our business plan, just resources regarding the process of opening an outpatient medical clinic and the laws related to that process (yes, we intend on hiring a healthcare lawyer to ensure we are in full compliance).  I also recognize that there is risk in any business venture or investment, so please no lectures on that; we both have enough assets in ""safer"" investments to ensure that we'll both retire on time.  Neither of us are going to risk our life's saving to open this clinic.

Thank you.",4,23,2015-12-06,PHARMA,0.03138141334056854,0.9339414834976196,0.034677110612392426

medicine,Any interest in more structured case reports on reddit?,"I enjoy putting up ECGs and case reports here and hearing/learning/teaching with the users here.  However, I've found a major limit with using reddit for this is the lack of real time interaction.  This is needed to allow details of the case report to come out piecemeal (which fosters more thinking about the differential at each stage rather than jumping to imaging/labs). It also fosters a better element of participation and response to questions for learning.  

So, this week I have been fiddling around with trying to come up with other ways that might work (making something from scratch, trying to add chat to my blog, experimenting with twitch.tv, etc...). So far none of these have yielded much fruit and I'm coming back around to thinking about how one could overcome the above limitation.  

It seems like having people aware and eager to participate in a case report *at a sceduled time* would be the key to doing this successfully.  Is anybody interested?  I was thinking of making a separate subreddit to keep things more organized and not buried by other submissions, but would be open to any other suggestions.  I was also thinking that after each case report there could be a submission with links to the relevant literature for any clinical questions that were raised.

medicine,Chiropractors and Nerve Injury,"Saw a 37 yo female patient yesterday with 4 week history of shoulder and trapezius pain making it difficult for her to sleep at night. Three weeks ago she went to see her chiropractor for cervical adjustment. Within two days of that adjustment, she began to experience right arm weakness and increasing frequency of headaches and twitching beneath the right eye. 

On exam, she is seated comfortably and is conversational, well developed, and appears stated age. She has an unremarkable ENT exam. Her lungs are clear to auscultation, heart rate and rhythm are regular without murmurs, rubs or gallops. 

Neurologically, her cranial nerves are intact. She has 5/5 left shoulder ab/adduction and flex/extension, 5/5 left elbow flex/extension, and 5/5 grip strength. Her right shoulder demonstrates 4/5 abduction and 4/5 forward flexion, grip strength diminished, 4/5 elbow flexion with 5/5 extension. Reflexes not evident in either upper extremity.

She has normal neck flex/extension and rotation, but limited right flexion to the shoulder as compared to left. Only point tenderness found was in the trapezius. 

So what do you think? Next steps? Appreciate feedback, because I am really wondering whether the chiropractor may injured her cervical nerves.",24,16,2015-12-08,PHARMA,0.07640675455331802,0.8935964703559875,0.02999677136540413

pharmacy,Doctors not following protocol on manually signing controlled prescriptions sent over via fax?,"Not sure about other states, but in Texas if a doctor is to fax a prescription for a controlled medication, they have to manually sign their name on the Rx before its sent over. I'm a fairly new tech, but I'm under the impression this is a fairly new change in the Texas law.

However, it seems like a surprisingly large amount of doctors are not manually signing these prescriptions, and instead are just electronically generating their signature on the prescription before its printed and faxed over. Unfortunately with how the law is, we cannot fill any prescription that is electronically signed in this case. This is very annoying, because a lot of the time some are sent over late in the evening, and by the time one of us call the office they're closed. That now leaves us techs to try and explain to the patients that they will have to wait until tomorrow (or until Monday if it's a weekend) to get their medications because we will need to call the office and verify. Typically, that doesn't go well with the patients who somehow always manage to blame the pharmacy and put fault on us for whatever reason.

Our pharmacist has scanned the excerpt from our states' laws and practice book on how faxed prescriptions for controlled drugs need handwritten signatures on them. She then sent that to at least 10 different doctors' offices that have been consistently neglecting this rule. We've even called a few offices and told the receptionist nurse to remind the doctor of this rule. A lot of the MD's have gotten better, but there are still several doctors who consistently do this and it's very frustrating for our pharmacy as well as our patients.

Is it really that hard for the doctors to understand? Are they not familiar with the protocol or do they simply not care? Since the nurses can verify the prescription whenever we have to call we think that they don't even tell the MD who is writing them, so that's why they continue to just use their electronic signature. Is there anything that I can do as a CPht to make this any easier for our pharmacy and our patients?",17,13,2015-12-08,PHARMA,0.043430931866168976,0.9252687096595764,0.0313003845512867

pharmacy,We filled a script we knew was fake.. (I'm the tech.),"Ok,  long time lurker, first time poster. Heads up,  this is on mobile.  My apologies now for weird spelling errors.

Both me and my pharmacist the other night are both ladies and a guy came in.   He'd never used our pharmacy before.  Wearing a hat. Handed us his ID. Rx was for #90 oxycodone, 30mg. The pharmacist and I both grimaced,  I felt it was a fake. This guy came in at 5:50 on a Friday night,  minutes before we close,  knowing the doctor's office was closed,  too. 

Bullshit,  right?  

Pharmacist chose to tell him the cost (he was cash pay) was $133. It wasn't of course,  she was hoping he'd go elsewhere. 

I wish she'd just told him we were out of stock. 

We ended up filling it.

Next day we had another one come in just like it. 

We told him we were out of stock.  He left. 


What would y'all have done?  My pharmacist was claiming it was a safety issue. She didn't want the waiting in the parking lot by our cars if we didn't fill the script.

medicine,"Foundation deanery issue, can anyone advise?","I'm an FY1 in Scotland. The programme I am on gives you both FY1 and FY2 rotations - i.e. you don't reapply for FY2 posts. It is understaffed and we already have 2 LATs. For FY2 I rotate to a different health board and many of the FY1s from there rotate to my health board for FY2.

Recently we got an email out of the blue stating that our rotations for FY2 have changed. This decision was never even discussed with us, we didn't know a change was on the cards and we were given no warning or opportunity to object or say which of our rotations we wouldn't mind chaging.

The reasons for this change have not been particularly explained in any detail. So far we have been told it is ""in our best interests"", to give us a ""more generalised, community-based training"" and to ""fit with GMC curriculum for 2016"".


One supervisor has stated (fairly off the record) that the HB I'm rotating to has at least 9 posts unfilled and we have been shuffled for this reason, and also because their current curriculum doesn't fit the GMC's requirements.

The other trainees (even those not going to a different HB for FY2) and I are very angry at this point for many reasons. 

* This decision has been made after we ranked and got placements we were happy with. 

* We were not given the chance to discuss it with the deanery. 

* Despite constructive efforts on our part to find swaps they have vetoed all exchanges, even when we have someone to swap for the whole of FY2.

* The changes they have made do not fit with the reasons they have given - e.g. I previously had A&amp;E as a rotation, this is now maxfacs, where is the community and generalisation in that?

* The email we received was patronising and condescending, implying that we are incapable of choosing rotations that will provide us with a good education, that ""taster sessions"" and audits are as valauble experience within a department as a full 4 month rotation.

* For many of us they have changed the one rotation we chose the whole programme for - I've lost A&amp;E as have 4 others and we all either want or are considering A&amp;E careers, another 2 have lost psychiatry and one lost opthalmology.

We have had very few replies and it takes the deanery a long time to reply when they eventually do. The reply has basically been ""tough luck, we're allowed to do this - it says so in the T&amp;Cs. Don't fight us or you'll regret it"".


We have spoken to the BMA but unfortunately there is nothing they can do as it is not truly an employment matter but an issue with NES and the deanery.

Does any one have advice for this situation? Has anyone been similarly screwed over?

More importantly how easy is it to get a standalone FY2 job in the UK with A&amp;E in it? And how sson can I move to New Zealand?

pharmacy,Resolving a pharmacy mess - prescription sent via mail with no tracking number,"I recently moved from a state where prescriptions are good for 18 months to a state where prescriptions are good for 12 months.  I have a Symbicort script written in my old state which cannot be transferred into the new state because it's 13 months old and the new state considers it expired.  The pharmacy in my old state (a Walgreens) told me they could ship the Symbicort to me in my new state, and I agreed because I figured that'd be easier than scheduling a doctor's appointment and getting a new prescription in this state.

A week later the pharmacist at Walgreens is saying he sent the prescription standard mail with no tracking number. I don't have the medication, and since they didn't send it with a tracking number, there's no way to know where it is or even if they really sent it.

Yesterday I ended up getting a new script in my new state because I had no idea what was going on with the prescription that was mailed, and neither did the Walgreens that sent it. The problem is that since the Walgreens that mailed the prescription has a paid claim in their system and will not reverse it because they say it was filled, I can't fill the new script through my insurance.  I'm getting quoted a cash price of $300 to fill the medication, and I don't think I can get that reimbursed by my insurance company.

I've spoken with my PBM, the Walgreens store, and Walgreens corporate.  The PBM and Walgreens corporate employees I spoke with are completely baffled about what to do because they've never seen a Walgreens retail store mailing medication out before.  However, they will not reverse the claim because the Walgreens store says the medication was dispensed even if I haven't received it.  My new local pharmacy says they can't use an override to make the claim go through.

What are my options at this point? I'm pissed off beyond belief that a pharmacist would be dumb enough to mail a $300 medication with no tracking number, and I don't know what else to do at this point besides eating the $300 if new Symbicort hasn't arrived Monday by the time the old Symbicort inhaler runs out.",27,12,2015-12-20,PHARMA,0.14320844411849976,0.829755425453186,0.027036141604185104
pharmacy,What do you all think of generics as a commodity industry?,"So with pretty much any product in a grocery store except prescription pills, you have a lot of choice. You can buy a Hershey's chocolate bar. You can see where it's made. It has a Lot number stamped right on it. Or you can buy an off-brand and even when you do that, you see where it's made and it also has a lot number. You have a lot of choice: organic, locally produced, etc.

There is something about the generics industry, though, in which either consumers don't have so much choice or they have not demanded more options.

And the generics industry is interesting in that it is very openly a commodities market. There are companies that make active ingredients and those are sold to pharmaceutical companies, and they're made into prescription drugs, and the end product itself is really simple. It basically just contains the active ingredient and some fillers or coloring agents. There's not much to it. And so it's a race to market and for FDA approval to basically prove you can make a tablet that produces the right blood levels of a certain active ingredient. 

And when you go to a brand's web-site, you can tell that it is not a web-site advertising a product to consumers. There's mainly financial information, concerning which company has bought another, etc. 

I recently had a product question for Zydus and went to their web-site and could find almost no consumer-facing information. They advertise that they are the ""fourth biggest player in India."" Player is not a word consumer-facing companies would use to describe themselves.

I've said before that it's almost as if you went to Oscar Meyer's web-site and found a lot of information about pork futures. 

It really seems that with the pharmaceutical industry there is a race to the bottom in terms of cost and quality. The FDA has standards for factories but it can't inspect them all regularly, and the end tablets have not been tested by the FDA until very recently, and even now very, very few are (there are some experimental programs by which the FDA is giving grants to universities to test a limited number of generic tablets).

What would it take to turn the drug industry into a consumer-focused industry? Would it take customers demanding higher quality prescriptions with inspections that go above FDA guidelines and/or prescriptions made in the US?

Or do you think that demand will never come?",13,8,2015-12-20,PHARMA,0.03793433681130409,0.9333733320236206,0.02869231253862381

EDIT:  This is a case of myopericarditis.  Classic pericarditis history and ECG but with the elevated troponin he has myocardial involvement as well, which happens in about 10-20% of cases. The etiologies of myopericarditis is pretty similar to pericarditis.

In this case, the patient had a sore throat two weeks prior to this event, making a viral cause most likely.  I also checked for group A strep, got some blood cultures on the off chance it was bacterial.  He had an ECHO in the ER that showed mild systolic dysfunction (EF 40-45%) and was admitted for further observation (troponin trend) and workup. I should also note that there was no pericardial effusion or evidence of pericarditis on ECHO (which is not uncommon in pericarditis).  A shot of ketorolac (AKA toradol) made him feel much better.

medicine,Has anyone else had a particularly memorable patient or event that has made you substantially change your viewpoint on something?,"**Disclaimer:** The specifics of the cases have been changed enough so as to not be able to identify a specific patient. I think this should be okay vis a vis PHI, but if the mods disagree, please remove the post. 

Anyway, I can recall two distinct instances where my prior preconceptions were greatly changed by a single event:

========================

**Number 1:** When I was a medical student, I watched a gentleman on the heme/onc service (100% end stage of life, hours to days to live, DNR) hemorrhaging out from a tumor in his pelvis that had eroded into his pelvic side wall, bladder, and rectum. Like, the sheets of the bed were bloody. IR took him and embolized the tumor and stopped the bleeding and gave him a few more days. He was still definitely going to die, but at least he didn't hemorrhage out that day.

==============

At first I didn't understand why they were going to do anything. I kind of thought IR wouldn't even offer it, and if you had asked me before meeting the family what to do about it, I would have said ""nothing."" But we had a family conference about it and it felt like we were essentially telling the patient and his family that if we did something we could stop the bleeding, but if we did nothing that he would die. We talked with the patient and his family at length, and they eventually opted to go for embolization. 

*edit:* We didn't *literally* say those things to the family, of course. Sorry if that wasn't clear. I was just trying to convey the gist of the conversation. It was very open and respectful and we laid out the risks and benefits and such. Everyone knew what we meant when we said ""intervention"" versus ""comfort care"" though. I was just trying to be succinct.

==============

At the end of the discussion, my attitude was completely changed. I tried to really put myself in that same situation. If it had been my dad lying there, I would have a very hard time just saying, ""no, let him bleed out."" I became a lot more accepting of the decisions that families sometimes make, even if I don't always agree with them. It definitely gave me a lot of insight into the more human aspects of medicine.


==============


----------------------------------------------------


==============


**Number 2:** I was performing a CT guided drain placement on a patient. The patient had afferent limb syndrome after having a roux-en-Y (basically, the hepatobiliary limb was completely obstructed and fluid filled). ALL of the literature says management is surgical (to fix the JJ anastomosis), but IR got bullied into trying to place a drain in the excluded stomach. Anyway, everything was going very well until we actually tried to dilate the tract. In retrospect, I think what happened was that the dilators, instead of cutting *through* the thick wall of the stomach, instead pushed the stomach away from the wire, and that all the positive pressure in the stomach made her start spewing bilious fluid into her abdomen. The patient tanked really fast, code was called, etc. Went to surgery, survived, fixed the JJ, and was discharged. The outcome was relatively okay. 

==============

But it was the first time that I truly understood that you can perform the steps of a case with 100% technical accuracy and *still* have complications. I became instantly much less judgmental about other people's complications on that day.

medicine,"Bee Stings, and why the best tool to remove the stinger is your fingers.","Hello, Meddit! 

My name is Jordan Benjamin. I am a herpetologist, a wilderness paramedic, and a snakebite medicine specialist; planning to pursue an MD in the next year or two. My primary academic interests these days are wilderness medicine, envenomations, and emergency med. I wanted to put this post together because one thing I have encountered in my work is a plethora of bad information regarding the best practices for management of various bites and stings, both in the field and in the clinic. So on to the subject of this post; an evidence-based debunking of the common misconceptions surrounding management of bee stings and a simple recommendation for the best strategies in removal of the stinger. As a wilderness medicine guy, I am often asked what to do in the event of a bee sting. To be clear, I am not addressing the clinical management of patients suffering from massive envenomations by dozens to hundreds of bees, which can result in coagulopathies and all sorts of other systemic effects. This post details the best practices for responding to a single bee sting (or a couple of stings) in the first minute or two following the event. 

I originally wrote this up to answer a question from a woman who asked whether the sawyer venom extractor (an ineffective and potentially dangerous mechanical suction device marketed as the only medically proven field treatment for snakebites and other envenomations) could provide any benefit for treating bee stings. I have a much longer post on the do's and do-not's of snakebite, which I can post separately if there is interest. Without further adieu, the meat and potatoes of this argument. 

Since I am not a bee guy, I did a pretty extensive search of the literature to make sure I wouldn't be misinforming anyone. The information I dug up in a few old journals was very interesting. Surprisingly few studies have been done on this subject, but I found a fantastically designed, peer-reviewed study looking at the kinetics of bee stings and venom injection ""Rate and quantity of delivery of venom from honeybee stings."" I will post the abstract and a link to the full text PDF at the bottom of this post so you all can come to your own conclusions, but here are the important pieces with respect to your question. This applies to honeybee species that leave the venom sac and stinger in the victim; wasps retain their stingers and can sting repeatedly. The study doesn't tell us much of anything about wasp stings, but the venom should be injected and distributed into the tissue much faster than a honeybee sting...so the sawyer would definitely not make sense to use on a wasp sting. Back to the honeybees...

What they consistently found in honeybees that leave the stinger and venom sac in the victim can be distilled down to a few key points.

1. When a bee sting occurs, the smooth muscle surrounding the venom sac immediately begins to contract. This causes the stinger to embed deeper into the victim's skin (about 2/3 of the way into the skin in the first 30 seconds). At the same time the venom sac is being squeezed like a turkey baster and injecting its contents deeper into the tissue due to the burrowing of the stinger.

2. All of this happens really fast. In the first 20 seconds after the stinger hits skin, 90% of the venom is injected into the victim and the stinger has burrowed deeper to facilitate injection into deeper tissues simultaneously. Even the slowest stingers in the group were done burrowing and injecting the vast majority of their venom by 30 seconds after the sting occurred.

3. Part of the study involved removal of the stingers at various times (5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 s, etc) after the sting occurred and then quantifying the differences in amount of venom injected over time. Not surprisingly, they found that the earlier a stinger was removed, the less venom was injected into the recipient...however, after 20 or 30 seconds the process of envenomation is basically over with so to make any real difference you need to get the stinger out in the first couple of seconds.

Okay, so the take-away's here are that you need to get the stinger out fast. How many people would be able to stop whatever they were doing, throw down their pack, locate, open, and assemble the sawyer extractor with the appropriately sized suction head for the affected body part in 5 or 10 seconds? I know I certainly couldn't. Even if I could do it in under thirty seconds, it would still be the worst option available to me - sorry again, sawyer.

The fastest way I can think of for removing a stinger would be to use my fingers, pinch it, and pluck it out as fast as possible. The sawyer might seem to make more sense here, because even though it would take longer to put on you wouldn't be squeezing the rest of the venom in by pinching the sac. The big question becomes, what is the fastest way to get the stinger out with the least amount of venom injected? So I did a little more research, and found this in the excellent wilderness medicine tome (Wilderness Medicine, 6th Edition) by Paul Auerbach:

""Although recommendations were that stingers should be scraped or brushed off with a sharp edge and not removed with forceps, which might squeeze the attached venom sac and worsen the injury, this has been refuted (304,364). Advice to victims on the immediate treatment of bee stings now emphasizes rapid removal of the stinger by any method (364). Wheal size and degree of envenomation increased as the time from stinging to stinger removal increased, even for a few seconds. The response was the same whether stings were scraped or pinched off after 2 seconds.""

So there you have it, folks - the sawyer will likely (almost certainly) prove less effective than your fingers, as will fishing around for a credit card or similar flat object to scrape the stinger off. Don't waste time trying to get the stinger out without crushing/squeezing the venom sack, just get that thing out the patient as quickly as possible. (Kind of reminds me of the song from monsters inc, if anyone else gets that reference). To recap: the biggest determinant in how much venom will be injected is the length of time that it remains in the victim prior to removal; crushing or pinching the venom sac during removal does not significantly alter the amount of venom injected. Like I said, pretty useful tidbit of obscure information to come across.

But what about home remedies like baking soda? I'll let the good Dr. Auerbach answer that one as well.

""Home remedies, such as baking soda paste or meat tenderizer applied locally to stings, are of dubious value, although the latter is often regarded as effective. Topical anesthetics in commercial ""sting sticks"" are also of little value. Topical aspirin paste is not effective in reducing the duration of swelling or pain in bee and wasp stings and may actually increase the duration of redness (18). Local application of antihistamine lotions or creams, such as tripelennamine, may be helpful. An oral antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine, 25 to 50 mg for adults and 1 mg/kg for children, every 6 hours is often effective.""

If you want me to provide citation links for the papers Auerbach cites as (18, 304, 364) I will dust off my copy of his book and pull them for you. The study I draw my earlier conclusions from is titled ""Rate and quantity of delivery of venom from honeybee stings"" and a direct link to the abstract, as well as a full text PDF, can be found here: http://www.jacionline.org/article/0091-6749(94)90373-5/abstract

Ironically, it seems that the study was sponsored in part by Sawyer. Oops. I wrote out the abstract below, for anyone who wants to get the abbreviated version. I also included some of the findings from the full text version to provide additional information. 

Abstract
To determine the rate and completeness of delivery of venom from honeybee stings, European bees were collected at the entrance of a hive and studied with the use of two laboratory models. In one model bees were induced to sting the shaved skin of anesthetized rabbits. The stings were removed from the skin at various time intervals after autotomization, and residual venom was assayed with a hemolytic method. In the other model the bees were induced to sting preweighed filter paper disks, which were weighed again after removal of the sting at various intervals. Results of both experiments were in agreement, showing that at least 90% of the venom sac contents were delivered within 20 seconds and that venom delivery was complete within 1 minute. The data suggest that a bee sting must be removed within a few seconds after autotomization to prevent anaphylaxis in an allergic person. The extensive variation found in the amount of venom delivered at each time point may explain inconsistencies in relationships among reactions to field stings, sting challenge testing, venom skin tests and RAST.

Pertinent data drawn from the full text article: 
""In both rabbit skin and various artificial media, the autotomized sting was noted to embed itself progressively deeper over a period of approximately 30 seconds. By the end of this period, it was noted that at least two thirds of the length of the sting was embedded.
In the rabbit skin model venom in 63 sacs was depleted by 90% over a period of 20 seconds. There was a statistically significant negative relationship between residual venom and time (p &lt;0.05). No residual melittin could be detected at 40 seconds, indicating that the venom sac was empty (Fig. 2).

In the paper stinging model the rate of increase in dry weight of venom delivered into the paper medium was similar to the rate of depletion of venom from the stings implanted in rabbit skin (Fig. 3). The relationship between venom delivery to the disk and time, analyzed by linear regression, was significant (p &lt; 0.05). Although venom delivery varied considerably, the average weight gain of the disks at 20 seconds after autotomization was 140 pg, similar to the average venom sac contents of domestic honeybees. There was no tendency for further weight gain after this time, indicating that venom delivery was rapid and complete in less than 30 seconds.""

So this is a topic I see that pops up quite frequently and I have never had a direct answer one way or another. Here is hoping this posting can shed some light....

For my background, I work as a paramedic in a busy urban emergency transport system

With acute moderate to severe asthma patients, is CPAP (not BiPAP) indicated for these patients?

My thought process is that because asthma patients are experiencing air trapping and mucus accumulation, CPAP would further worsen the symptoms. BiPAP has the ability to ease up during exhalation therefore allowing the patient to let air escape, unlike CPAP with its continuous pressure that is exerted.

Although asthma has some characteristics similar to COPD, there are subtle differences that I feel would not benefit asthma patients.

Though I realize the the general use of (and demands of prescribing) opioids in the US is very different to Europe, this just seems crazy to me. Here, I would rarely (if ever) prescribe narcotics to anyone I would send home from the ER. In general, I would admit (more or less) any patient with enough pain to warrant opioids - and prescribing like this to a pregnant woman would definitely be considered poor clinical judgement, and I would risk the license to prescribe narcotics if reported.

Lastly, this applies specifically to viperid envenomations in North America. Elapid envenomations (such as the coral snake, or all snakebites in Australia) require a different approach using lymphatic constricting bands (the pressure-immobilization method) to delay circulation of neurotoxins until a medical facility can be reached. If you are in the United States, don't pick up a coral snake and you will be fine. Accidental bites from these snakes are almost impossible, barring the nightmarish situation where a young child picks up the snake. That said, I have been meaning to write out some detailed instructions for non-viperid envenomations and will try to do so in the next day or two. On to the good stuff. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello,

My name is Jordan Benjamin, I am a herpetologist specializing in venomous snakes and a wilderness medicine practitioner with experience treating many snakebite patients in West and East Africa, most of them in remote health centers that pose some of the same challenges as treatment of a snakebite in the wilderness or backcountry environment in the US (supplies are limited or non-existent, the patient has a long way to go to reach a hospital, etc). I have also been fortunate to have the opportunity to train a number of individuals and groups in snakebite medicine and field management of snake envenomations in remote conditions including medical officers and corpsmen with the US military, US &amp; international doctors and nurses in African hospitals, wildlife rangers, etc. I am including my background and real name because this issue is important to me and I stand by everything I am about to write; I want to give you all the peace of mind that I am who I say I am and not some competing company throwing out baseless accusations behind the cloak of online anonymity. Feel free to look me up online, I gave a TEDx talk on the issue of snakebite in sub-Saharan Africa last year and I invite those who doubt my identity or simply want to learn more about the issue of snakebite in the developing world to check it out. You can do so here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmkTAqRH2xk 

The short answer to the question of whether or not the Sawyer Extractor can effectively remove venom from the site of the bite is a resounding no: the Sawyer Extractor and all of the other ""snakebite kit"" variations employing suction, incisions, electricity, heat, cold, and so forth have been repeatedly shown to be utterly ineffective at the job they are designed and marketed to accomplish. They simply do not work! The caveat it that there is one clever application of the sawyer that has been proven to work great, which is for the removal of flesh-eating botfly larvae that can be acquired in various tropical regions of the world...see ""Simple and effective field extraction of human botfly, Dermatobia hominis, using a venom extractor."" Full text PDF link can be found here: http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/3/336.full.pdf+html 
I am afraid to say that at the moment that is the only medical situation where this device may possibly prove helpful. When it comes to snakebites, it is not only completely ineffective at removing venom from tissue following a snakebite, but may actually prove harmful and cause a serious local necrosis (think in terms of a cookie-cutter style wound forming a deep cylinder of rotting dead tissue under the site of application). This may be due to a concentration of residual cytotoxic and myotoxic venoms near the site of the bite, while the majority of the venom will continue to diffuse into systemic circulation - but since we really don't know exactly why this happens that is purely speculation. For any interested parties, the article demonstrating this is titled: ""Effects of a negative pressure venom extraction device (Extractor) on local tissue injury after artificial rattlesnake envenomation in a porcine model."" I am attaching a link to the article here: http://www.doctorross.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/bush-sp-snakebite-suction-devices-suck-emerg-med-clin-n-am.pdf

Here is a second PDF showing local tissue damage in a 7 year old boy who had a suction device applied to the site of the bite for 20 minutes prior to arrival at the emergency department: http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(05)02106-2/pdf

There are probably several reasons why this type of first aid does not work. One issue is that the recurved fangs of vipers penetrate and inject venom deeply into the tissues beneath the skin, and the tunnel created when a fang penetrates the skin immediately collapses as soon as the fang is withdrawn. Another issue is that large quantities of venom are believed to diffuse very rapidly into different tissue compartments. This means that there is no direct route between the visible puncture marks on the surface to the area where venom was injected, and the significant quantity of venom is already well on its way. I have read the company's testimonials and seen the occasional news stories about a snakebite victim ""whose life was saved by the Sawyer Extractor"" or similar device, and all too often that is a quote attributed to the physician who treated them. I don't doubt the veracity of the quote as deeply entrenched myths and misinformation about snakes and snakebite are unfortunately as common in doctors as they are in the rest of society at this time. The sawyer extractor is popular because it provides us with an intuitively sound solution to the terrifying prospect of suffering a snakebite far from medical care, suddenly rendered utterly helpless as the venom takes effect and all we (or our loved ones) can do is wait and watch as the venom takes over. It is nothing more than a modern variation of the infamous ""black stone"" from Asia and Africa, a charred piece of cow bone that is stuck to the site of the snakebite and remains there absorbing fluid until all the venom has been drawn out of the bite whereupon it suddenly detaches and falls to the ground, is boiled or washed in milk to cleanse it of the venom, and ready to go when the next snakebite happens. Both of them provide the perfect optical illusion by visibly extracting some quantity of blood and straw-colored fluid (which looks incredibly similar to many viper venoms) from the site of the bite, but this is nothing more than the pale-yellow plasma (whats left after you remove the red cells and clotting components from blood) and other exudate draining from the wound as edema sets in and the venom begins to show effect. If you feel like you have been duped, don't take it personally - the notion that a snakebite can be treated by somehow extracting the venom has successfully fooled us since at least the 1400's, when the black stone was first mentioned as the go-to remedy for treating snake envenomations. Several years ago, a close colleague of mine met a European surgeon who was in Central Africa on a medical mission and explained that he needn't worry about snakebite, because he always carried a black stone with him for such a situation...as you can see, even the most highly educated medical professionals are not immune to the myths that pervade the issue of snakebite. I grew up carrying a sawyer extractor with me whenever I went out to look for snakes and lizards, and no one would be happier to hear that the sawyer extractor did what it claims than those of us who work with snakes and face an incidence of snakebite many times higher than that of the larger population. But the reality is that these devices do not work for snakebites, and marketing them for that purpose is a dangerous action with potentially tragic consequences. Evidence-based medicine and all studies to date suggest that they are at best ineffective and at worst harmful. If you would like to see more evidence of this, check out:

""Snakebite Suction Devices Don’t Remove Venom: They Just Suck"" [http://www.doctorross.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/bush-sp-snakebite-suction-devices-suck-emerg-med-clin-n-am.pdf]

and

Suction for Venomous Snakebite: A Study of 'Mock Venom' Extraction in a Human Model"" [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14747805].

This product has no business being marketed for use on snakebite. Out of more than 40 snakebite patients I have treated for viperid envenomation in Africa, 95% of them had already received bad first aid prior to seeking treatment at the hospital. Practices like cutting at or around the site of the bite, applying tourniquets to the bitten limb, and attempting to extract or neutralize venom using electricity, fire, permanganate, black stones, magic, mouths, mud, dung, leaves, ground up dried snakes, and yes - even fancy suction devices like the Sawyer Extractor - are dangerous and detrimental for two reasons. First, in a snakebite time is tissue and a lot of it is wasted performing bad first aid. Many snakebite patients injure themselves by panicking immediately after the bite, I have seen more than a few individuals who suffered serious traumatic injuries in addition to the snakebite because they took off running from the snake at full speed only to suddenly fall face-first onto a rock or trip and stumble over the edge of a steep embankment. This is particularly problematic if the venom is capable of producing a coagulopathy. The second issue is that signs of an envenomation may in some cases take hours to appear, and the combination of seeing a useless suction device drawing fluid out of the bite along with a delayed onset of symptoms is an easy way to decide that you don't need medical care after all because you the used extractor less than minute after the bite and saw it remove the venom, or you feel fine and don't want to inconvenience the whole group because you've all been planning this trip for months, or any number of other rationalizations we can make with ourselves to keep from going in to get the bite checked out. The majority of bites from venomous snakes in the United States are suffered by young men between the ages of 18 - 25 who are intoxicated (usually alcohol) and attempting to pick up, kill, or otherwise interact very closely with a potentially deadly snake. This is a demographic that is particularly prone to making the wrong decision about whether they should laugh it off cause they feel okay or should immediately seek medical care for a life-threatening emergency. I have had patients come early after the bite and I have had patients come after great delays, and I have noticed two things. The first is that those who arrive early often do so because they are suffering from a severe envenomation and become very ill very quickly, while those who come late often waited because they believed falsely that the first aid measures taken were sufficient or that they were not seriously envenomated. The second observation is that many of the patients who delay seeking care only come in when they finally reach their own line in the sand for what constitutes a serious enough problem to go to the hospital, and they often tend to have more complications, longer hospitalizations, and a higher chance that the bite will result in permanent disability because of how long the venom has been allowed to work unchecked. They often arrive in the critical condition with severe envenomations just like the group of severely envenomated patients with the shortest delay to care, but instead of showing up in a critical state of hemorrhagic or hypovolemic shock they arrive in shock with their kidneys failing, or with late-stage bleeding into the brain, meninges, abdominal cavity to compound all of the other symptoms. Late-stage complications can be incredibly difficult to treat, they are excruciatingly painful for patients, heart-wrenching cases for medical personnel, and they are entirely preventable with prompt care. If you are bitten by venomous snake or are unsure as to whether or not the snake is venomous, please, please, please focus on how to get yourself safely to emergency medical care and don't bet your life on any of these commercial snakebite kits. The only effective, definitive treatment for a snake envenomation is the appropriate antivenom to neutralize the venom of the species you were just bit by. I repeat, THE ONLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR SNAKE ENVENOMATION IS THE APPROPRIATE ANTIVENOM. Repeat that five times and then move on to the section below for some helpful tips on what you actually should do in the event of a snakebite in the middle of nowhere.

To end this on a positive note, there are several things I would suggest you do following a snakebite that are extremely beneficial.

1. Walk, don't run, and carefully retrace your steps to get out of the immediate vicinity of the snake and avoid the possibility of stepping on any others nearby. 20 or 30 feet should be more than sufficient, the snake wants to get away as much as you do.

2. Find a safe place to sit down. This is important! Viper venoms in particular contain vasodilating compounds that open up your blood vessels to facilitate rapid diffusion of venom out into systemic circulation, which means you may suddenly suffer a dizzy spell and faint because your blood pressure just dropped too low to pump all the way to your head while you are standing upright. This is relatively common with viper bites and often happens in the first few minutes, so do yourself a favor and sit down so you don't pass out while running and hit your head on a rock. Like I said, you would be surprised...it happens all the time. These are usually brief fainting spells and you stand a good chance of avoiding it altogether by not standing up in a state of abject terror, but if you faint it shouldn't be more than a few minutes before you are cognizant again and I guess if you want to look at the bright side, you just really nailed the whole relaxation part of step 3 and are sort of ahead of the game...but you should repeat step 3 now that you are conscious anyways.

3. Remove any rings, watches, bangles, anklets, tight clothing, and anything else from the bitten limb because there is a good chance it is going to get a whole lot bigger than it was when you bought that toe ring…Do this because any of these items could potential become a tourniquet when swelling makes them impossible to remove, and that could cost you the limb below whatever is choking off the supply of oxygenated blood. Tourniquets of any sort are not good for snakebite, so please don’t try to tie your shoelaces or belt or anything else above whatever part of you just got bitten. There are somewhere between 5,000 - and 10,000 snake envenomations in the US every year, but most will not suffer any major permanent disability and on average only 5 people will die in a given year (mostly very old, very young, highly allergic, and other high-risk populations). Your odds are quite good, so be grateful you live in the US and make sure you don’t become a (bad) statistic by doing something stupid that makes your situation a whole lot worse than it was already.

4. Now that you are sitting, take at least 5 minutes to calm down and put your mind to a productive task: planning your evacuation. Time to break out the two items that I highly recommend for a snakebite kit that will help you save your own hide. First up...Do you have a cell phone? Does it have service here? If not, where did it last have a connection? Since the only effective treatment for a snake envenomation is the right antivenom to neutralize it, a working cell phone is your best means of getting information out to the emergency personnel who will do everything in their power to bring you safely out of the field and into the best medical facility for your current predicament. If you can call right away, those 5 minutes you took to calm down are going to prove helpful in relaying key information such as who you are, where you are, what happened, how you are feeling, as well as pertinent information like any other coexisting medical conditions and medications you currently take. If you take any sort of anticoagulants (blood thinners) then that is definitely something you want to inform them of right away, and please folks - DO NOT TAKE ASPIRIN, ADVIL, OR OTHER NSAIDS AFTER A SNAKEBITE. All of those medicines thin your blood, and they can cause very nasty problems for snakebite patients. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is okay, take up to 2x 500mg tablets if you feel the need as it won't interact with the snakebite in any way but don't forget to tell the medics everything you have taken when they get there to avoid being double-dosed.

The second item I cannot speak highly enough of for snakebites is...drumroll...a sharpie! If you are seriously envenomated, your primary objective right now is to get to the antivenom and get the IV flowing so it can do its job. From a clinical standpoint, there are several things you can keep track of now that will prove immensely beneficial when you reach the hospital and we are assessing the severity of your snakebite to figure out if you need antivenom, how much you need right now if you do, and what other effects the venom is causing so we can treat them with the other drugs we have available and try to make your stay a little more comfortable. Here's how this works. You are going to assess yourself from top to bottom and document significant findings on your person along with the time that you are observing it. Notes can get lost during evacuation or rescue, but your leg is coming with you to the hospital whether you like or not so get ready to mark it up! First thing is to circle the site of the snakebite with the sharpie and write down the time next to it. Draw a circle around the border of the swelling, or if the bite is on a finger or toe then draw a line at the edge of the swelling as it moves up the limb, and once again: write down the time. Write down all of the things that you are experiencing right now that are not normal for you next to or within the circle you just drew - just make sure it’s clear what time you are writing them at. Go through all of your 5 senses and write down everything that is out of place, being sure to include the following:

Metallic taste in your mouth, changes to sense of smell, sudden loss of vision, double vision, visual disturbances, ringing in the ears, headache, nausea and vomiting, bleeding from anywhere, dizziness, shortness of breath, tremors or twitching or cramping that moves up the bitten limb, pain, numbness, tingling, burning, electric shocks, and all manner of unusual sensations, loss of bowel or bladder control, excessive secretion of saliva/tears/snot/sweat, droopy eyelids that feel heavier and heavier and are hard to open, can’t stick out your tongue at your friends like you could a few minutes earlier, can’t shrug your shoulders, feeling of impending doom, and anything else we might want to know about (if you suddenly believe that you have developed a sixth sense you should probably mention that too).

Not only do you get to take a break for arts and crafts immediately after your snakebite, but you are also creating a timeline charting the progression of signs and symptoms as they occur and providing the critical information we medical people need to figure out how serious of a bite you are facing and what steps need to be taken to stay on top of a developing situation. In all seriousness, the importance of doing this cannot be overstated, and it is something that you should continually reassess and update every 15 or 30 minutes as the swelling moves up the limb and your symptoms develop. The other great thing about this is that it gives you something to focus on that will play a large part in saving your life and limb, and having a task really does help you to stay calm and get things done. The first few minutes are going to play a large part in how this whole thing turns out, so stay calm and put on your thinking cap.

5. Try make contact via cell phone if it is easily doable, calm down and carefully assess/document what you find, and if you cannot get in touch with anyone then you need to very carefully think about where you are, how you got there, and what options you have to either get yourself to help or get help to you. I have had patients who walked miles out of the bush after serious snakebites to their legs, they did’t die from exerting themselves like many people fear will happen and they all recovered because they made it out to medical care. You will be much better off walking yourself out, slowly, via the same way you came in than you will be sitting around waiting for help if you couldn’t reach anyone and no one knows you need help. I am not suggesting you skip or do high kicks your whole way out (I think that it would be painful enough that you would be forced to stop doing them before you could do any serious harm), I am suggesting you plan the easiest, most well-travelled route back to civilization, take stock of your supplies and get some food and water in you so you don’t pass out on the way from something preventable like dehydration, watch your footing and move slow and steady to your target destination.

Remember, the basic principles are pretty simple. Stay calm or get calm, find a place to get yourself together and check your resources, remove constricting bands, document the envenomation, hydrate and nourish, contact help, or make a careful plan to make contact one way or another and get out the word that you need medical assistance. Don’t let fears of “raising your heart rate and increasing the speed of venom circulation” prevent you from physically moving to get to care. From what I have seen, the venom is going to get out into circulation regardless of whether or not you sit still for 24 hours or apply a suction device like the sawyer. If you apply a tourniquet you may manage to prevent the venom from traveling out into circulation, but that would be a big mistake to make because you face a very high chance of losing your limb. Don’t put a tourniquet on and unless you fall into one of the high-risk categories discussed earlier, there is a very good chance that you will recover completely following prompt and appropriate treatment at a hospital. And remember folks, when it comes to snakebite no first aid is a whole lot better than bad first aid in the long run! Tell the boy scout to put away the pocketknife, don’t kill your own limb with a tourniquet, don’t listen to the weirdo you pass on the trail who enthusiastically offers to suck the venom out with his mouth or pee into the wound because it saved his friend all those years back…And if you have a sawyer extractor or any of the other varieties, just remember that when it comes to snakebite they really do suck. Show it to someone else and pass on the word that devices like this are more likely to cost you your life or limb than to save it, because folks who are making them have thus far been unwilling to stop making claims about these devices that have been repeatedly debunked by researchers. Don’t throw it away though, because if you ever get a botfly larva under your skin while in the tropics you can seriously impress your friends with the worlds most shocking entomological party trick when you whip out the sawyer botfly extractor and expertly suck out a wriggling maggot from the painful red bump on your backside that it currently calls home.

**EDIT: Any and all comments, suggestions, pearls, resources would be very much appreciated. I have added what I feel I know something about. Will update accordingly.**

I have modified the list a little bit for clearity - I feel the points should be fairly specific as the original idea was to find *specific* things an intern should brush up on (e.g. management of electrolyte derangements is pretty broad). I will first post the list without any links to resources and then add them with edits. Hopefully, I will have some crowdsourced help from meddit. The list is as follows: 

**1) Fluids. How and when to use them, dosage, timing and other pearls.** 

- [Review of fluids](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakWOfKcCcCZBMlKIJLofiOhp) (not how to use them per se) by Dr. Strong /u/ericstrong

- [Maintenance Intravenous Fluids in Acutely Ill Patients - NEJM](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1412877?rss=mostViewed) Not sure about the relevance. Please comment, may remove. 

- Pretty thorough review of fluid management on [openanesthesia.org](http://www.openanesthesia.org/fluid-management/)

Still hoping for a more practical no frills do-this-then-that-resource. 


**2) Nausea. When to treat, how to treat and at what dose.** 

**3) Standard pn orders: pain killers, sleep aids and antiemetics aka how to reduce nighttime calls from nurses by 25%**

**4) ""Reflex"" antibiotic choice for routine inpatient infections.**

- http://www.bpac.org.nz/Supplement/2013/July/antibiotics-guide.aspx /u/ChristianM and u/ive_been_up_allnight

**5) Initial work-up and treatment of dyspnea.** (more realistic to approach by symptoms as, unfortunately, you first have to diagnose whats wrong. E.g. heart failure, pulmonary edema, embolism, COPD, pneumonia).

**6) Initial work-up and treatment of oliguria/anuria.**

**7) A sensible initial approach to suspected ileus.**

**8) Blood. When, how, why to replace.**

**9) Pain. Optimal management without inducing narcosis.**

- [Managing cancer pain: Frequently asked questions: CCJM](http://www.ccjm.org/index.php?id=107937&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=365585&amp;cHash=bbfa0a0455a459f2d18e792efcec9334)

**10) Potassium. When, why and how to shift or replace.**

- A review on both potassium and sodium disorders by Dr. Strong /u/ericstrong (Not reposted in 12) hyponatremia but applies there as well) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakXVIAapcSEleP4doUdHVtld

**11) Hyponatremia. Most common electrolyte disturbance, commonly mismanaged.**

**12) Resuscitation aka commit the ACLS algorithms to memory.** 

- Current ACLS guidelines. https://www.acls.net/aclsalg.htm

Would love a video series, interactive cases etc. 

**13) Basic EKG interpretation.**

**Whole EKG video courses**

- A [whole free youtube EKG video review course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakXhL1WoDvNPm1cG57pjE0d7) by meddit's own u/ericstrong

- An alternative EKG course that takes you through all the basics. This however has no free version and costs 96$ a year. The quality is amazing. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/user/ECGTeacher/videos) are 6 basic sample videos on youtube. The paid course is available on http://www.ecgteacher.com/

- I have to admit I haven't used this course personally but his free youtube videos are on-point and he seems like a good teacher. Also behind paywall. Free youtube samples are [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/ECGDoc). The full course can be found here https://www.ecgacademy.com.

**EKG video cases**

- Amazing [case-of-the-week emergency medicine EKG videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8mJfzSyRohn4iQqV6Tx9qUW0tkZSQn2) on youtube by Dr. Amal Mattu

-- If you like Dr. Mattu's cases (and you most certainly will) he is still posting every single week on his new site https://ecgweekly.com. It costs 4 starbucks coffees **a year** and is going to save someones life.

**Practice EKGs with answers**

- Watching videos isn't enough, you still have to grind out EKGs to keep your game strong. Visit http://ecgmadesimple.com and http://ecg.bidmc.harvard.edu/maven/mavenmain.asp for this. 

**EKG blogs**

- I recommend signing up for some kind of RSS feed (e.g. https://feedly.com/) and subscribing to the following EKG blogs: 

-- http://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.is (Dr. Smiths ECG blog)

-- http://www.ems12lead.com

-- http://ecg-interpretation.blogspot.is

-- http://jhcedecg.blogspot.is

**EKG resource libraries**

- [Life in the fastlane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ecg-library/) has a nice resource to look up a specific EKG finding, criteria or concept.

- http://www.practicalclinicalskills.com/ekg.aspx /u/collidge

**14) Know when to order ABGs and how to interpret them.** 

- Almost [too detailed video lecture series on ABGs and how to interpret them](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFDCF820E88FC83ED) by Dr. Eric Strong (/u/ericstrong)

- Practice makes perfect. ABG interpretation generator. https://abg.ninja/abg


**Bonus 15) Basic CXR interpretation**

**CXR video lecture course**

- Again, Dr. Eric Strong has an excellent video course for free on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYojB5NEEakU6vTUAoUeVhgRzQgaoSnFi)

pharmacy,Is it illegal the change days supply for insurance?,"I float in Colorado and most stores I go to changes the days supply on the prescription so it goes through Colorado Medicaid. Medicaid has a limit of 4 pills per day for all narcotics. So for example if a doctor writes for Percocet 5/325 #30 1 to 2 tabs q 4 to 6 hrs and you eneter this as a 2 or 3 days supply you get a rejection error so the pharmacy just changes the days supply to 8 (7.5 rounded up) and it goes through. Then we just tell the patient that the insurance won't pay for it again for 8 days. 
I was at a store last week and they said they would never do this because it's illegal and I could/would lose my license for doing it. Has anyone ever heard of this happening? Is it illegal or is it just against insurance policy and might cause a chargeback? Has anyone ever heard of someone getting in trouble for doing this?

medicine,What was a memorable yet embarassing patient-care moment for you?,"To start off: I remember one day I started rounding in the hospital. I printed my sheet of patient list and entered Ms T's room. I had already reviewed her chart prior to going in so I knew she had mild dementia and a history of leg amputation, among other things. I talked to her in length since it was my first time seeing her, but her answers didn't make a lot of sense with what I reviewed in the chart. However, since she had dementia, it didn't seem all that unusual. I brushed it off as perhaps some degree of delirium secondary to her illness. I proceeded to examine her and noticed that she had bilateral pitting edema in her legs. 

Didn't she have a leg amputation? I rechecked the patient chart and that that problem was still there. I excused myself and confirmed with the nurse whether this was Ms T, and they said no, that they just moved her down the hall (but the computer system didn't update yet). 

I realized that I just wasted 20 minutes talking to the wrong patient, and luckily there was no family member and the patient's primary doctor didn't swing by. I didn't go back in to tell the patient what happened, since she probably won't remember anyways. I remembered I did ask her if she was Ms T during my introduction and she had said ""yes"". From that day on I always doublecheck the wristband.",100,119,2015-12-30,PHARMA,0.10348813980817795,0.8698496222496033,0.026662185788154602

medicine,Why do EpiPens have extra hidden doses?,"Videos like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luultUD0eK0) show that it's possible to cut open an EpiPen and access additional epinephrine if necessary. However, this fact isn't widely known, isn't advertised anywhere, and isn't taught in wilderness medicine courses or anything similar. So why does it exist? I realize the epinephrine itself is pretty cheap, but why do the companies include it if they don't tell anyone?

Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this/I broke any rules here!

Edit: I found a couple articles ([1](http://www.academia.edu/5296446/Retrieval_of_Additional_Epinephrine_from_Auto-Injectors) and [2](http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-60321300094-X/abstract)) that explain the procedure for obtaining the additional epi from Epipens. One article gives the following explanation (which kinda answers the question):

""Why so much additional epinephrine is included in single dose auto-injectors is a common question. One author (C.W.) contacted Dey Pharmaceuticals, manufac-turer of EpiPens, with this question. Their answer was that the extra epinephrine helped keep the delivery system stable, but they did not answer subsequent queries as to how extra epinephrine specically stabilized the delivery system.""",28,37,2015-12-30,PHARMA,0.037551116198301315,0.9314376711845398,0.03101118840277195
