Health,"I have a medical mystery. Help me, Reddit, you're my only hope.","Here's the deal. On July 31st, 2011, I went to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain, distention, and profuse vomiting. Diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction was made by CT scan. They gave me Zofran and Dilaudid, inserted an NG tube, and kept me a few days for observation. Plain X-rays showed that it had cleared up about 24 hours later. After a few days, they send me home, and tell me to come back if I have any more abdominal pain.

A week later, I get abdominal pain again, so I come back, and plain X-rays show another obstruction. This time, they skipped the NG tube (still gave me the meds). It resolves on its own, and they send me home a few days later.

Since then, I've had to go to the emergency department four more times. Each time, it's the same drill; give me meds and an IV, wait a day, and I'm better.

In the meantime, I've met with multiple gastroenterologists. They've performed leagues of tests:

- Lots of imaging: CTs and plain X-rays during and after the obstruction; small bowel follow-through; CT enterography.

- Blood work: General nutrition, iron/ferritin, ESR/CRP (inflammatory markers), Complement C4 (angioedema), Celiac sprue panel, and others

- Two capsule endoscopies

The only diagnoses they hadn't ruled out were scar tissue/adhesions or internal hernias. So they finally gave up and referred me to a general surgeon. 

Today, they performed an exploratory laparoscopy. They found nothing. I had given consent to convert to an open procedure, but the surgeon decided not to bother, since he thought the chance of finding something was too low to be worth the damage.

Extensive searching on PubMed has not revealed anything particularly remarkable, with the possible exception of recurring phytobezoars. I will be talking to my doctor about that possibility as soon as I can get a hold of him.

Needless to say, I don't expect anyone to be able to give me a definitive diagnosis, when my doctors have been unable to do so with a much greater amount of information. Mostly, I'm wondering if anyone reading this has also had (or has treated) recurring bowel obstructions for something that proved to be an unusual cause -- meaning, not an adhesion, tumor, hernia, or Crohn's.

Ever since I was young kid I knew I wanted to go into medicine. I had shadowed/explored the career through high school and college and thought it was ""cool/interesting."" I really enjoyed MS1 and 2 and loved learning the path/pathophys. Understanding how things worked in the body was thrilling. I hated memorizing facts and such but did it to build the base of knowledge to work around. If I could understand something I could 9 out 10x remember it. Now I'm almost done w/ my 3rd rotation of MS3 (finished IM and surg) and I just feel depressed with the actual day to day goings on at the hospital.  Maybe depressed isn't the right word though. It just seems like everything is so ""protocol"" based that half the time I just feel like robot. I really thought there'd be a lot more thinking/analysis involved. I mean I know I'm a 3rd year student and my role is more towards reporter/info gatherer but even what the interns and residents do seem so rote.  What I enjoyed the most during the transition from MS2 to MS3 was being able to come up with a diagnosis/differential. But now 95% of the time that's not super challenging anymore. And oftentimes they just order labs/path that reveal what it is. Then people go into uptodate and look up how to manage/treat it if they'r unfamiliar with the diagnosis or if they want ""new"" ideas. It just feels like a robot can do it. Then on the surgical/procedural side, it seems like 75% of people's days are spent doing the same exact thing over and over. And a lot of it getting replaced by midlevel providers that just do the same thing over and over. I guess my main dissatisfaction is I just dont feel like im solving a puzzle or using my brain and energy meaningfully anymore. It seems like everyone just loves facts/memorizing random tidbits instead of doing any real analysis. They just seem to love regurgitating relative risks and probabilities.

Health,A gnarly Carcinogen is created when we Fry/Bake/Toast just about anything. The biggest offender? COFFEE (and potatoes),"Since there was a recent COFFEE IS AWESOME thread here, it seems logical to inform people about Acrylamide. It is formed 'naturally' when we fry/bake/roast most things from sugars reacting with the amino acid asparagine. It can be researched at [NIH](http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/assets/docs_a_e/acrylamide_fact_sheet_508.pdf) and other reputable organizations.  

When I first discovered it, I assumed it would be some benign substance, but it's actually more toxic than Styrene. One of the most shocking discoveries for me was learning that it's abundant in [COFFEE](http://www.thecorsaironline.com/lifestyle/2011/09/23/acrylamide-a-coffee-drinkers-worst-nightmare/) In fact, the reason coffee shops in California have to post a carcinogen warning, is because of Acrylamide. From my research, consuming vast amounts of this liquid is ill advised, but to each their own opinion of course.  

Another huge offender is all things fried/baked Potato. In a McDonalds french fries order, there is [600 times](guardiannews.com/society/2002/aug/15/food.foodanddrink) the permitted amount for a glass of drinking water(!) That said, there are  [some things you can do](http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/acrylamideqa.html) to minimize Acrylamide exposure while you cook.  


As I'm more anal than most regarding such things, I weaned off of coffee and onto green tea which is actually  [an inhibitor of DNA Cancer 'adducts'](http://foodconsumer.org/7777/8888/C_ancer_31/113011212008_Fear_acrylamide_Drink_green_tea_or_red_wine.shtml) along with crushed/chewed raw garlic and resveratrol.  

The research itself has led me to discover some interesting theories as to why there is so much cancer in our world. For most of human history we have actually boiled our food where fried/BBQ'd was only for special occasions or aristocratic types. Perhaps the fact that we fry/bake/roast so much nowadays could play a role(?)  
 
We don't have all the answers yet, of course, but I thought this information might be useful to anyone else overly-cautious regarding the foods and drinks we consume in abundance. :)",29,18,2012-12-04,PHARMA,0.048550717532634735,0.9283638000488281,0.02308552898466587

Health,Can pH levels have any effect on cancer?,"Hello reddit community,

My father (age: 60) has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The only information I know about it is what my mother told me last night, and that it is being considered ""aggressive.""

Along with what the doctors at the VA hospital are advising him of doing, he is doing some research on the side about lifestyle changes he can make to help.

He has come across an idea about body pH levels and that if you're body is more alkaline, then cancer has a difficult time sustaining itself in your body (possibly disappearing altogether).

He has come across a YouTube video from an older gentleman who ""cured"" himself after being labeled terminal with prostate cancer. He uses a concoction of baking soda (Arm &amp; Hammer), molasses and hot water and drinks it once or twice a day it seems.

Here is a link to his video: http://youtu.be/Yl8Y8I_TsjI[1]

I'm curious to find out any opinions from fellow redditors on the possibility that this has any chance of helping my father whatsoever.

Maybe there is someone on here who has actually used this idea, or just does it anyways without actually having cancer to maintain a balanced pH level.

Is there any evidence other than this video to support this theory?

While waiting for possible answers/opinions, I'll be ""studying it out"" on my own as well.

Thanks

Health,Depressed and finally looking to seek help. Where do I start? What worked for you?,"I'm 22 and I've been depressed since I could remember. I started having my first thoughts of suicide when I was about 10 because I didn't know how to deal with my anxiety and felt I had no one to turn to.

My parents never sought help for me as they didn't want to admit there was something wrong with their daughter. They thought it was all in my head and made me feel guilty for feeling the way I did. 

I remember when I was 10 and I finally brought myself to tell my mother that I was having 'bad thoughts' she told me that she didn't want me to ever speak about it ever again and that if I did people would think I was crazy and put me in a mental health institute.

Fearing ridicule and judgement, I did as I was told but my depression just got worse over the years. I now find myself unable to function properly.

I need help.

I'm too embarrassed to go to the doctor. I don't know if it's all just in my head but I fear being put on medication and my friends and family finding out about it.

I think it would help to hear what others have done in my situation. I don't have anyone to talk to in my life about this. But I need help.

What's worked for you?

tl;dr - I'm depressed. What are some effective treatments?",12,10,2012-12-10,PHARMA,0.16421324014663696,0.8077219724655151,0.028064806014299393
Health,I think I broke my asshole.,"This is pretty gross, so be warned.

I travelled to Mexico about 6 months ago.  While there I ate something bad and ended up with severe explosive diarrhea for 2 days.  We're talking a couple times an hour, there was a whole lot of vomiting going on too.  It got better and I enjoyed the rest of my vacation, then when I got home I started getting the runs real bad again, for a couple weeks.  I went to the doctor and he ran all the normal tests for parasites and put me on antibiotics.  

Fast forward to now - I have not had the runs for the past 4-5 months, but my asshole is not the same.  It's almost like it's not watertight anymore.  I take a shit and an hour later I feel like I need to wipe again, and when I do there's a thin layer of shit on the paper.  I think because of this, it always feels raw, burning and itchy.  I don't have a hemorrhoid so that's not it, but it's really god damn depressing.  I just want my normal asshole back.

I really have no idea where to post this, this seemed like a good place though.  Anyone have a clue what the heck might be going on down there?",67,133,2012-12-11,PHARMA,0.0639590471982956,0.8841854929924011,0.051855508238077164
Health,"My GF is stuttering, feeling disconnected and having short term memory problems. After CT scan and EEG, doctors don't know whats wrong.","She is 22, healthy, and is on no medication, except the contraception. 

My GF started to first have gradually problems with speaking and started stuttering over several days. Then after going to doctors she started to feel disconnected and couldn't always remember details from conversations just a moment ago. She also says that she is unable to follow TV or read a book because she doesn't understand what's happening. She couldn't explain that any better.

She was initially given a medication for a minor stroke (or TIA?) to get the blood flowing based on the initial CT scan (they suspected it might be her contraception pills). However another doctor's opinion was that she didn't have a blood clot in her brain after few days and then they did the EEG, which came out normal.

Now she is still feeling disconnected and having the memory problems and slight stuttering and slurring of speech. She also has some expressions on her face I have never seen before. The doctor's currently think it might be something psychological because she was somewhat depressed before the stuttering started. She is feeling fine otherwise and hasn't thrown up or anything and never lost her conciseness.

Can all these symptoms really be psychological?",82,114,2012-12-11,PHARMA,0.38327136635780334,0.5902469754219055,0.026481637731194496

UPDATE: Thanks so much for the many helpful responses.  I went to see a doctor and was prescribed Nystatin as a few of you mentioned.  However they scraped my tongue and looked at it under a microscope and they saw no thrush, but we decided to treat it as such in any event just to be safe.

medicine,Disparaged med student,"Second year med student here. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or just want an outlet and r/medicine is the most applicable place. I’m just feeling kinda disparaged by a few things

**Tests** – After a year and a half, I cannot seem to figure out how to score well. It’s not like I’m failing, and I know grades aren’t the most important thing in the world, but it’s still discouraging. Moreover, it feels like I’m preparing to simply regurgitate facts. I find myself missing the days of orgo/math/econ where you had 2-3 hours to solve 5-10 questions. You really needed to think your way through problems. Now it feels like you just recognize buzzwords as fast as possible.

Don’t get me wrong, there are many things I find fascinating. For example, the pathophysiology of coarctation of the aorta. How it occurs distal to the 3 main aortic branches, leading to HTN in the upper extremities and hypotension in the lower extremities. But I can also tell you that while S aureus is the leading cause of osteomyelitis, Salmonella should be suspected in sickle cell patients. However, I couldn’t tell you WHY this is. It’s just a disparate fact without explanation. Any reasonably intelligent person could have memorized this. For whatever reason, this feels unsatisfying. And most of what we learn seems to fall in the latter camp. 

**Work Ethic** – As ridiculous as it may sound, medical school is without a doubt the laziest period of my life. I graduated magna cum laude from a good university. I played sports, volunteered, worked during breaks, and led a more active social life. Now, I have literally 0 extracurricular responsibilities and I’m putting in less time and effort at school. It’s not like I’m going out with friends or drinking or doing fun things. I just dick around on reddit or play videogames. I feel guilty, but I can’t be bothered to put in a consistent effort. 

**Clinical Skill** – As far as I can tell, most patients find me pleasant. Regardless of the actual interview, the standardized patients generally give me high marks for being receptive to feedback and working on ways to improve. That being said, I’m finding out that I’m a pretty shitty historian. I never seem to be able to answer an attending’s follow-up questions, either because I didn’t elicit the information or I don’t understand his/her line of thinking. Furthermore, many of my HPIs and complete histories have been torn apart. It’s never been humiliating, but there’s definitely a sentiment of “You’ve got a ways to go, kid.” It’s one thing that the science isn’t clicking, especially when I know I could be working harder. But when you can’t get the art side down either, it really makes you question whether you’re going to be a good doctor. I shouldn’t be doing terrible at *everything.*

**Social Life** – I’ve never been Mr. Popularity, but neither am I a pariah. I usually get along with most people and err on the side of a small group of close friends. Now things feel different. While I don’t actively dislike anyone in my class, I certainly don’t feel close to many. When we go out, I’m still a little bit nervous about having enough to say to people. I’m not comfortable just jumping into a circle of conversation. It’s like reverting back to highschool where you aren’t sure where you fit in and feel self-conscious about all your actions. 

I know this became super long and I don’t really expect anyone to read it. These are just some things that seem to be getting the best of me lately.",51,61,2012-12-13,PHARMA,0.08710238337516785,0.8859390020370483,0.026958655565977097

medicine,"Dear meddit, I have a moral/ethical/legal question I need to be advised on please.","Here is the situation with a tad of back-story. My wife is 25 weeks pregnant. We were recently told by our ob/gyn that the child has a single umbilical artery. A targeted ultrasound confirmed that the child has a heart defect and double cleft palate. We are still waiting on the amniocentesis results to determine what chromosomal anomalies, if any, the child may have.


Yesterday we visited a pediatric cardiologist who confirmed the heart defects and classified them as such: mitral valve atresia, double outlet right ventricle, pulmonary hypoplesia. I have a basic understanding of what this means and what to expect once the child is born and further into the future.


Here is my question. Can we opt out of having any medical procedures done to the child once she is born? As in no heart surguries. When I brought this up to the cardiologist he stated he would be uncomfortable with such a decision given that the nature of the defects aren't extreme. My wife does not want to have the child go through numerous heart surgeries; additionally we know that because the heart is operating with only a fully formed tricuspid valve - but no mitral valve - that increased strain on the heart down the line will potentially require a heart transplant. This decision is not one that we can make based on where medicine may or may not have advanced 15 or 20 years down the line.


I know all this sounds crazy and bizarre. We are emotionally torn about all of this and don't know how to approach it. We thought about having an abortion but considering how late the pregnancy is neither one of us was comfortable with the idea.

Please try to refrain from judging us too harshly. I don't mind reading peoples opinions but I am mostly looking for what options we have, if any, once the child is born.",14,13,2012-12-13,PHARMA,0.057441212236881256,0.9159280061721802,0.026630815118551254

I'm sorry if this isn't an appropriate sort of thing to post in this subreddit. I have an first year resident in the family, and I was trying to think about good gifts for her.  She's obviously very busy, so I was wondering, is there anything that you'd really love to have for work that you'd never splurge on yourself?  I mean, is there anything that another doctor breaks out during charting that makes you look at them and go ""goddamnit I want one of those""?",15,8,2012-12-15,PHARMA,0.11375755071640015,0.84559565782547,0.040646810084581375
Health,Can someone help my lips?,"What's wrong with my lips and how do I fix them? There are black dots all over my lips (6 dots total: 4 clearly visible, 2 smaller ones).

http://i46.tinypic.com/28bsfhs.jpg

Here's some information:
- There are black dots on my lips. 
- I don't smoke or drink coffee. 
- They don't hurt or are bumpy.
- I moisturize my lips regularly. 
- They do not get bigger but I can see more black dots being formed. 
- I tried changing my diet, toothpaste and drinking more water but no help. 
- Two of them are quite old but the rest are quite new (appeared within 1 - 2 year). 
- I asked my doctor and he just said they were some pigment spots that should go away in the long run. But some of them have been there for a while and still haven't gone away. 

Does anyone happen to have the same problem? Or does someone know how to cure this?

In the past I've been told to get better shoes, so I did - special foam shock reducing ones. I even wear shock reducing socks and jog on grass wherever possible (about 80% of each run).

Health,Low energy all the time,"I am a 26 year old male. 

I have had an ongoing issue for years now that has been incredibly aggravating. I have constant low energy levels, reduced cognitive function (focus, terrible memory). I don't wake up feeling refreshed most days, but even on days where I feel somewhat refreshed, my energy levels still remain low. I have had blood work done frequently over the past couple years all showing I am healthy. I am very active physically (I am at the gym doing cardio / weight lifting 6 days a week in addition to training in kickboxing. I am physically active with high intensity workouts 1-2 hours most days). I eat religiously healthy (to the point where people I know are shocked if they see me eating a piece of pizza). 

I have low levels of anxiety, however don't really experience depression. 

I desperately want to resolve this as it is carrying a strong impact on my quality of life. I am an avid learner, I love to read, watch films, and educate myself on various topics... But these cognitive deficiencies are de-abilitating in my ability to do so. I can rarely follow plot lines of shows/movies... I have difficulty remembering / comprehending things I have read unless I am very persistent in re-reading the same material over and over.  

I am a software engineer and these issues definitely have a noticeable impact on my ability to focus on work, implement complex logic, and re-call interactions with clients, co-workers and work I had done previously. 

I have tried MANY things to various levels of success, though nothing thus far has brought me back to what I feel is appropriate for me. I wasn't like this in high school.

I have done:

- Meditation
- Removing / Limiting caffeine intake
- All sorts of supplements (nootropics, relaxation supplements, vitamins)
- I have done an elimination diet for a month (removing gluten, dairy, meat). 
- Following a more strict sleeping regime 

I am suppose to partake in a sleep study in the near future to maybe identify issues in that regard. I don't really fit the characteristics common with something like sleep apnea (I am in good physical health, I don't snore, etc), but I do know that despite it being unlikely, it could be the case regardless. 

I am wondering if people have encountered a situation similar to mine. I feel I am running out of options. 

Any help is greatly appreciated!

I had hoped to visit a hospital to ask questions, but so far my inquiries have received no response.  I wonder if some of these questions can be answered by this subreddit.

The patient in this story is a twelve year old girl who has been severely burned in a housefire, suffering third-degree burns over 60% of her body.  The story begins some period after her injuries and she is no longer in critical condition.

I know that patients react differently to burns, but I wonder if some of you have dealt with severe burns could give me broad answers.

--How long would a burn patient as describe above spend at the hospital? I know this would vary greatly from patient to patient but I only need an estimate.  Also, what might be some signs that a patient is well enough to go home?

--I assume the patient would receive skin grafts, maybe cultured epidermal autografts. At what point in the recovery would these begin?

--What signs are looked for to decide if a patient is no longer in critical condition?

--Are burn patients still dressed with bandages? If so, how often are they changed? If not, what methods are used to prevent infection?

--Are burn patients typically given their own recovery room? or are they sometimes group together is larger wards?

medicine,My rant against NP argument that they receive greater clinical exposure than Physicians during training.,"RK,

Your ""math"" is pretty inaccurate and misinformed. Below is an
explanation of my reasoning followed by a suggestion for ""Doctor-Attack
Methods"" that you might find helpful in future arguments. 

Direct patient contact in most US medical schools begins in your first year now
and is continued throughout the second as medical students prepare for their
Step 1 Board Examinations. 

Medical students then undergo 2 years of clinical rotations through primary
care, surgery, elective specialties etc.

Upon finishing their 4 years of medical school, they will apply and attend a 3
to 5-year medical residency as a physician. 

Upon completing their residency they may wish to complete a fellowship (such as Pain Management or Pediatric Emergency Medicine) and will continue their
training for 2-3 years.

Many DNP programs do not require experience as a RN but rather a Bachelor’s in Nursing (a degree rather than experience). 

http://fpb.case.edu/dnp/entry.shtm

http://www.mghihp.edu/academics/nursing/degree-options/rn-to-doctor-of-nursing-practice/default.aspx

Some DNP programs are actually online, negating your emphasis on direct patient interaction.

http://www.capella.edu/online-degrees/dnp-nursing-practice/

http://www.waldenu.edu/doctoral/doctor-of-nursing-practice

http://www.umass.edu/nursing/academics/doctor-nursing-practice-dnp-online

Clinical Education for NP programs is estimated to on average 2,800-5,350 hours.

Clinical Education for DO/MD programs is estimated to be on average
20,700-21,700 hours. 

http://www.aafp.org/online/etc/medialib/aafp_org/documents/press/nurse-practicioners/nurse-practicioners-training.Par.0001.File.tmp/NP-Kit-FP-NP-UPDATED.pdf

In conclusion, you are absolutely incorrect with your ""math"" and anytime I hear a NP gear up a ""we spend more time.."" argument I
simply smile, knowing that they will believe whatever furthers their ability to practice advanced independent medicine. 

Now to help you with this argument I propose the following statements which I
believe:

1. NPs are just as smart as Physicians

2. Physicians are not automatically better than NPs

Now what I think you should focus on is not the amount of training that NPs receive (it is entirely a poor attack) but rather the performance of Mid-Level
providers and patient outcomes. If you take a look at many studies, there is no difference in patient outcome regarding whether or not a DO/MD or NP is
treating.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23247958

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23243110

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23238621

Therefore, instead of trying the 'ol ""we have more patient experience!"" bit, you could instead say ""hey look at the patient outcomes without 2 years of biochemistry and associated sciences, why do we even do that?""

I will say this though. NPs pushing for greater autonomy and responsibility have overlooked I believe is the saddest aspect of medicine: NPs have become simple pawns. 

Don't worry though, Physicians are being chiseled down to pawns. 

Insurance companies and hospitals do not support DNPs or PAs because you provide better care or are more compassionate; they support you because you are cheap. 

You are paid roughly 20-30% less than what physicians are paid, therefore you provide financial incentive to be hired.

However, if you continue your masquerade you will be successful in pushing physicians away from primary care. You will fill the “void” and be momentarily proud.

But then you will realize that you wish to be paid more because ""wow, this is hard."" You will demand to make what the former physicians made (you do the same thing!). You will come together (Nursing organizations are pretty powerful) and you will demand higher pay. 

At that point, your financial incentive for existence will no longer be present, and the studies paid for by hospitals and insurance agencies stating the excellence and competence of NPs will diminish. 

Also, remember now that physician organizations are incompetent when it comes to public relations, but they are learning slowly. Nursing stands currently as the honest and caring profession, but remember that once you change the game and become independent, you will face the same struggles that have demonized physicians. 

Don't buy that BMW, your patients might not believe when you say times are hard.

Health,Why does everyone act as if scabies is a big deal? It really isn't!,"I've had scabies a few times - I read something in the news about how there was an epidemic among the youth in my city due to some hippies infecting everyone, or something to that effect - and I don't get what the big deal is.  
  
The first time I was scared as fuck, I thought scabies was an STD and couldn't believe I had gotten it, since I hadn't slept with anyone for a long time. It just didn't make sense. Also, it seemed that everyone (on the Internet) judged it as something dirty, I had to be a hobo drug addict with AIDS to be 'eligible' for scabies. I felt horrible.  
  
Then I realized all I had to do was to wash all textiles on 90 degrees, spray down my bed and sofa with permetrine and rub my whole body in Nix cream and wait around for about twelve hours.  Despite my best efforts of *not* getting it, I've managed to get scabies a total of three times over the past two years. I have no clue how, I don't sleep in stranger's beds and I don't swap clothes with hippies, but here I am, currently with scabies. It's annoying, but as far as diseases go, it isn't bad. It's just as easy to catch as the flu, and people need to understand it's not a 'dirty disease'.

- Earlier this year, she developed ascites which progressed to pericardial effusion -&gt; tachycardia -&gt; surgery (pericardial window), which did not help.
 
- Her resting HR is still 130's. Her albumin is chronically low, around 0.5-0.8. She was on TPN, but it did not help her albumin. 

- She had diarrhea and no appetite, but both are now improved. She has some loss of vision. 

- They have ruled out: nephrotic syndrome, cancer, celiac disease, gastroenteropathy. All biopsies, scopes, and tests have been negative (she's done them all several times). 

- She's in Florida, has seen a gastroenterologist in LA, and been admitted in 3 different hospitals in Florida and no one knows what's wrong with her. 

- She's vegetarian, and wants to stay that way, but has increased her protein intake with eggs and other foods.

2nd visit: He did a chiropractice manipulation where he cracked my neck and back. I wasn't informed about it, he didn't tell me and I was taken by surprise.

I've been a male anorexic since I've been roughly 11-12. See, My divorced parents have dual-custody and I spend every second week with my father, who I have some issues with, but I rarely eat a full meal here. I may eat a bag of taytos, crackers or something small but I would never have a full cooked meal. I was always picky in my eating habits but now I just practically starve myself. Whenever I get sick, no matter what house i'm at, I pretend not to have an appetite which is a lot considering I don't have the nutrients or vitamins I need. 

Something else... I have a chest deformity (I believe), The bottom of my sternum? is raised abnormally and the ribs below are sunken in. I tried putting this all off until I've been getting chest pain in the sunken in areas, mainly the left side. 

I know this post isn't the best but I'm just asking.. How can I make it stop? I've tried getting motivated to eat and shop for food but it's just horrible. I spend all day on the computer and my brother/father just joke about it. I'm afraid to go swimming or even change in the dressing room.

pharmacy,Oxymorphone ER - What to dispense?,"http://articles.philly.com/2012-12-21/business/35955393_1_generic-versions-endo-pharmaceuticals-endo-health-solutions

Any community pharmacist here will be able to tell you that earlier this year in the summer, Endo, the company that makes Opana ER reformulated it to ~~make it crush resistant~~ keep the brand label affixed to it for a few more years. While this was happening, I, along with many others here received daily calls from people within 100 miles asking if we had any Opana ER left because they were out and the new formulation wasn't available. During this time, I noticed that there was a generic Oxymorphone ER 7.5 and 15 available. I ordered a few bottles and got a few of my regulars switched over to similar doses. To this day I still have 3 patients taking this dosage form.

So, a month later, Endo released the new formulation following in the footsteps of Oxycontin, who successfully has stopped generic Oxycodone ER for quite a few years. I have only been licensed a few years now, so I don't really know exactly what happened with Oxycodone ER. I just know that it isn't available.

So, assuming this article is correct, in less than 2 weeks there will be generic Oxymorphone ER available, at least for a short time until Endo gets them removed from the market (I am speculating here, but we don't have any generic Oxycontin so I am just following trends). I think it's bullshit when a company reformulates a drug and is rewarded with a longer patent life. If you get a prescription for Opana ER 20mg, which are you going to fill it with?

Technically, there is no substitute for the new formulation since the Oxymorphone ER coming out will not be crush resistant. However, since Endo never withdrew the original formulation from the market, it is still equivalent to the older, non-crush resistant version of Opana ER. In addition to all this, Endo just re-released crush resistant Opana ER 7.5 &amp; 15mg. Unless I see a DAW I have no intention of switching any of my patients back to a branded drug, however I am not sure what to do if I get an Rx for Opana ER 5/10/20/40?

Health,"Doctors can't help me, nothing I do brings any relief. Anyone have any advice?","I need some advice and hopefully Reddit can help deliver because I am in a jam. 

I am a 28 year old male, about 8 years ago I had a few recurrent UTI's with mild prostatitis. This was diagnosed via urine culture and a test where a urologist massages your prostate and tests the prostate fluid from your urethra. Each occurrence was treated with Cipro or Levaquin with no problem, I finished the prescribed medications even though my symptoms were relieved in all matter of days.

Back in 2009 I had what felt like a recurrence and visited a urologist. This time the Cipro wouldn't help, Levaquin didn't help, Bactrim (sp?) with no relief. I had a cystoscopy with no findings, urologist said my anatomy was perfect. Full STD panels all negative. It was treated with Flomax and after 8 months of discomfort was treated with a 10 day treatment of Azithromycin and lo and behold it worked, despite no infection being found.

So, here I am years later with what appears to be another flare up and nothing has helped, the doctors won't prescribe me Azithromycin saying it's not indicated for prostatitis to begin with, especially with no infection being found. 

So I am at my wits end, I just started my dream job and can barely concentrate with the discomfort. My symptoms are a constant urge to urinate when I don't really have to (I've had a barrage of ultrasounds showing my bladder is emptying). Not any real pain but an occasional ""twinge"" in the perineal area that can sometimes be a sharp pain. It mostly feels like an uncomfortable pressure behind my genitals.

Health,Please need advice with low pressure in head.,"A lot of people might complain with having too much pressure inside their head. I have the opposite problem; I have low pressure inside my head. The feeling is hard to describe but if I had to sum it up in one word, that word would be ""Horrible"", and it is chronic. 

I get an extreme amount of relief when I hang my head off of the side of my bed. I can hang for up to an hour until it feels adequately pressurised. 

I have [Plagiocephaly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiocephaly) and I think this is the cause. My head his longer and narrower than normal with a bulge at the top. This will sound crazy but I get great relief from pushing the top of my head up against the top of a solid door frame while standing under it. I can't really describe the feeling of this relief but it just feels really good. I do this sometimes but I am worried I might actually damage my brain. Unfortunately it has got to the point where the relief outweighs the risk.

I can honestly say this condition is hugely debilitating and a great source of distress. Any advice and suggestions are much appreciated. A solution to fix my problem would obviously be ideal and life changing. Thank you.

Health,9 months after a severe concussion I still suffer from terrible headaches. Any tips?,"I do see a neurologist and I am on amitriptyline to reduce headaches.I also take B2 and Magnesium supplements. I used to get severe headaches almost everyday. However, now I am down to 2 or 3 times a week. 

These headaches cause dizziness, vision problems, and loss of concentration. 

By doctor's order's I take 3 Aleve and 2 Benadryl when I am at home and get a headache. But I'm a high school student. My grades are suffering because I have to take naps to get rid of my headaches. In addition, I sometimes feel like I put myself and my siblings in danger when I drive my car. I have never gotten a severe headache while driving, and if I feel like I'm starting to I pull over and take medicine I have with me. I have a fear of killing myself, my siblings, or an innocent person if my vision  goes awry while driving. However, I can't stop driving my siblings around (3 siblings that all have practice almost everyday) because I have to help my mom out.

I have a few questions:

* Besides the supplements I already take, is there any other way I could better my chances of not getting headaches?

* My neurologist says to stay away from caffeine, but my sports med doctor tells me to try some caffeine to get a migraine away. Who is right in your opinion?

* Sports are obviously over for me. However, I used to play 3 sports and I ate like an athlete. In addition, the medicine I'm on causes me to be hungry almost constantly. How can I slowly work myself back into exercise, even just jogging?

I know I should be asking my neurologist these. However, it is very difficult to even have a phone call with her and appointments can take months to get in. My next appointment is at the end of January and I know she is hoping to ween me off my medicine, but I really don't think this can happen.",2,3,2012-12-25,PHARMA,0.10122673213481903,0.8680015206336975,0.03077172487974167

Health,Months of frequent urination and I'm going crazy,"Bear with me as I'm typing this on a phone. I'm an 18 yr old girl, healthy weight and well being generally. Since mid Sept. I've been having a urination problem. No pain, discoloration, or anything weird going on. Usually about every 10-15 mins at night, even after drinking liquids hrs ago. I definitely am very cautious about my sugar intake as well as how much liquids I drink. 

I urinate very frequently throughout the day but its hard to keel track when I'm busy with life. So when doctors ask me how often I have to go, its so hard for me to conceptualize a number. Just really often lol. Many times it comes in small amount but it varies. It feels like stream isn't being completed when I urinate, or theres something blocking it from coming all the way out (tmi sorry). 

Ive been to the doctors several times and even the hospital once, after urinating about 12+ times in one night. They told me it wasn't a bladder or UTI after taking different meds to no avail. They have also confirmed that there's nothing unusual with my urine and that I dont have diabetes. I've pretty much given up and have learned to deal with this rather annoying and shitty situation. 

I don't have insurance at the moment and won't have it til about mid Feb. I can't really afford to see a urologist, and like I said, have just been learning to live with it.

Health,"Isolated, circular patch of 'something' on my skin. What is it?","For about two months, I've had this isolated, circular patch of some thing or another on my back end. It's right between my arse and the back of my thigh. It's painful to the touch, perfectly circular and looks like little blackheads protruding from my skin. If I pick/pop/pull, it grows back... in the same spot! 

I do have adult acne (mostly due to PCOS) and dry follicular eczema, so I'm no stranger to dry skin *or* blackheads. This seems different though, especially because my acne is only on my face and sometimes a few pimples on my shoulder/back. By few, I mean *maybe* 2-3 per month. My eczema usually stays pretty controlled and is only on my elbows, knees, neck, and stomach. 

As for my bum, I've had no problems prior to two months ago. These really look and feel just like blackheads - but they are insanely painful, more-so than ingrown hairs, and keep coming back... no matter what I do. I had an uncle die of Melanoma, and know that it can show up in blackheads.. but I'm not sure this is the case.

Can anyone shed some light on these pesky, painful bumps?

I am an undergraduate pre-med student-- I love science and I love helping people so medicine seems like a great fit. For the most part I think that I can handle blood and guts but I have had a few negative experiences that make me uneasy.



The first time I watched a surgery I had a bad reaction to watching a nerve block. I became very hot, felt like I was going to faint, and then everything became black before I sat down in another room and then returned to the surgery later without a problem. 


The same thing happened today when I watched a nurse prepare an IV for my friend going into surgery. There wasn't even a needle out yet but I had to step out of the room to sit down. 



What can I do to get over this? I want to overcome this silly reaction and I am hoping it just happened because I am not familiar with it. Any advice or personal stories are appreciated! (By the way, I am interested in family practice or pediatrics, not really surgery)

This gradually all fades over 20-30 minutes, and my phlegm gradually becomes clear. It's getting really old, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life with this.

Each doctor I have seen has diagnosed it as Post Nasal Drip...mucus running down from my sinus' and nose down my throat. I have been prescribed different nose sprays and pills, but nothing has helped. I've also tried using the Neti Pot and slept with a Humidifier - still no help.

I also have seasonal allergies for all seasons, and am slightly allergic to dust and dust mites (had an allergy test done). To fight my allergies, I take Claritin-D. This is the only thing that has ever helped my allergies, and it has to be the Decongestant. I no longer take these every day, but only if I have a flare up, which isn't too often now. However, my nose is always stuffy...I can't remember the last time that I was able to breathe well through my nose.

Can any one of you help me out with how to stop all this phlegm from building up in my throat, so I don't have to spend all morning hacking it up and gagging? Have you ever had this and overcome it?

Thanks for your help, /r/Health.
