medicine,How am I supposed to “get help” when I am getting worked to death as an intern?,"tl;dr I’m depressed. I work every day but Sunday. How do I “get help”?   

I’m seriously depressed and have been for months. As an intern, I’m currently working about 5 am to 8 PM 6 days a week. Yep, that’s over work hours, but nobody gives a shit here. I’m reporting it accurately but surprise, no changes. I’m off on sundays usually. We have a night float so no post call days. I get two weeks of vacation, my first is in February.    

My depression has been worsening significantly. I need help. But I can’t get any. I asked about getting a couple hours off and was told “if I want my cointerns to hate me and pick up my slack cuz I can’t hack it, sure”. I don’t want to be seen as “that” intern. I go home and cry myself to sleep before waking up and doing it all over again.   

I called around. No psych places within a 50 mile radius are open on sundays or past 7 pm.    

Please help me

pharmacy,Just Wanted To Thank You All! From A Nurse,"Title pretty much sums it up. I found this sub because it was recommended to me by Reddit and I assume that’s because I’m a nurse. 

I work in a hospital, I always have, and I’m amazed by all the hard work our pharmacists do. I’m in pediatrics so they’re extra careful about everything. They even come to the room before discharge to do medication teaching saving us time and making our jobs that much easier. 

I don’t know if anyone I work with realizes how much that is appreciated and I’ll be sure to thank our pharmacists more than I already do. 

Anyways, I never realized how much shit you all put up with until I was reading this sub last night. Especially from providers! I thought we had it bad! 

So, thank you for all you do. I totally appreciate it both as professional and as a customer. 

Love,

pharmacy,Next decade is going to be the worst for US retail/community pharmacists...,"Because of following top 3 reasons...

1) bottom low reimbursement to the pharmacies not owned by PBMs... 

2) enormous lobbying money PBMs spend to operate their ""conflict of interest"" pharmacies that even they get enough patients/customers they can't afford to staff or pay their employees decent after their lobbying expenditure! (Also market saturation, why would they)

3) Market is oversaturated thanks to no actions from NABP, Board of pharmacies, APhA, etc.  

What can you do in next decade to help your self and the profession?

1) Campaign against CVSCaremark, Express scripts, Optumrx and Cigna as much as you can... Tell everyone about their awful actions in the name of saving healthcare costs... Tell ur uncles, aunts, friends etc... If you know someone in HR or decision making level at a Corp... Ask them to drop them or demand nation wide non pharmacy biased coverage from them. 

2) Campaign against pharmacy schools and their outrageous expansion... 

3) Screw/quit the retail stress for 40 to 45 dollars per hour (32 hours per week), work at a hospital, manufacturer, research, go to NP/PA school to become prescribers, work for BOP... Anything but shitless, peeless, lunchless and full of stress 12 HR shifts most US retail pharmacist work.

4) Can't find a job? Run for an office, volunteer in political scene... Change the system from within... 


Keep renewing your license tho... cause by 2028, US retail pharmacy scene may return to be a respectable profession!!
Until then stay strong y'all!

pharmacy,“I’m calling corporate!”,"What’s the most asinine thing a customer or patient has ever called/emailed corporate over?

Until recently, I could count the number of complaints to corporate (over an almost 10 year span) on one hand. In the past 2 months, however, it seems like we have “please complain to corporate over petty shit” tattooed on our foreheads. And, like most complaints to corporate, 99% of what they say is total BS.

My personal favorite: I refused to transfer a rx from another location because “we don’t fill prescriptions for junkies.” I also called the patient a liar, kept swearing, and embarrassed her in front of other customers. The interaction ended by me telling her to get her “fat ass” out of my “effing” (no, she didn’t say I said effing, but you get the drift) store. Reality was I DID tell the patient I couldn’t transfer the rx as it was a CII. At no time did I swear or even raise my voice, nor were there ANY customers around during the entire thing. And I most certainly didn’t tell her to get her fat ass out of my “effing” store! I actually laughed when my DM called to ask what happened &amp; told me what she said. Of course, she neglected to tell corporate (or the DM) what kind of rx it was and why I COULDN’T (not WOULDN’T) transfer it.

pharmacy,I would like to share a story that I think highlights just how far this profession has fallen.,"As many of you know, I was employed by Walmart for several years, and I've been quite vocal on this sub about the disgust I feel toward the company.  Sometimes I feel like I could write a book about the difficulties that we pharmacists experience on a daily basis, but after all those years and even after finally getting out of pharmacy for good, there is one instance that still lingers in my mind as the ultimate example of our downfall from respected professionals to the McDonald's of healthcare, our employers concerned with their profit margins above all else.  Here goes.

One day a middle-aged woman walked into the pharmacy and handed the technician two prescriptions for her adult daughter, who was pregnant and experiencing significant nausea/vomiting.  The technician quoted our usual ""15-20 minutes,"" and the woman walked away.  When the prescriptions reached my screen for verification, I noticed that they were for metoclopramide tablets and promethazine suppositories but were written by two different physicians.  As we all know, concomitant use of metoclopramide and promethazine is contraindicated due to the risk of EPS, so I called the physician who wrote the promethazine prescription, planning to ask if he would like to consider ondansetron instead.  While not a perfect alternative (given the controversy surrounding its use in the first trimester of pregnancy despite its category B status, along with the potential for additive QT prolongation if used with metoclopramide), I felt that it was a reasonable suggestion since it would allow us to avoid the contraindication while also maintaining the availability of a dosage form that did not require swallowing (i.e. going from suppositories to ODTs), just in case the patient's nausea was that severe.

Once the physician picked up the phone, I said, ""Hi, I'm a pharmacist calling from Walmart regarding the promethazine prescription you wrote for patient ______.  I'm not sure if you are aware, but another physician prescribed metoclopramide for this patient, so I wanted to speak with you regarding the interaction---.""  He cut me off.  ""What's the interaction?"" he asked.  I explained that both medications can cause EPS and that taking them together further increases that risk.  He said, ""I'm fine with it.  Fill both,"" before I even had a chance to ask about the ondansetron.

Fair enough, I thought.  It wasn't the first time a physician had refused to even hear me out regarding a recommendation for a medication change, and it certainly wouldn't be the last.  So I filled them.  Nonetheless, I thought it was important for the patient to be aware of the risks involved, so I attempted to call her but received no response.  At that point I instructed the technician not to give the medications to the patient's mother when she returned until I had the opportunity to counsel her on the interaction.

Eventually the patient's mother returned to the pharmacy.  I was on the phone, and the technician did as I asked and told the patient's mother to step over to the consultation window.  The phone call lasted about two minutes, after which I made my way to the window.  Before I could say anything, the woman snapped, ""I don't have any questions!""  I told her that there was a drug interaction about which I wanted to speak with her, and then she literally turned her entire body so that she was no longer facing me, as if to prove that she had every intention of ignoring anything I had to say.  Despite her behavior, I explained the interaction, that the physician had cleared it but that there was still risk involved, and what the patient should do if these symptoms were to occur.  She said nothing in response.

After she left, I wasn't satisfied that the information would be appropriately relayed to the patient herself, so I waited about 30 minutes and then attempted to call the patient a second time.  Thankfully her husband answered, and after I introduced myself, he said, ""Oh wow, I'm glad you called.  Her mom said that the pharmacist mentioned something about a drug interaction, but she didn't remember the details.""  I went through it with him and was relieved that he seemed to be on top of things.  All in all, it was an annoying situation but nothing out of the ordinary for retail pharmacy.

Or so I thought.  Several days later, I received a phone call from my DM, who proceeded to inform me that the patient's mother had called both corporate and the state board of pharmacy to complain about the fact that I made her wait two minutes to discuss a severe drug interaction.  The board obviously never even bothered to contact me regarding a situation in which I had merely acted in the patient's best interest, but my DM proceeded to yell at me over the ""poor judgment"" with which I allegedly handled the situation.  I'm the type of person who has certain values that I hold so strongly that I'm willing to defend them even if it results in negative consequences (within reason, of course), and one of those values is that in healthcare, the patient's well-being is always priority number one.  So I stood up for myself.  I said that I disagreed that I had done anything wrong and attempted to explain my perspective that if I had let the patient's mother leave without counseling, then I felt that the patient would be incompletely informed regarding the risks of her medication regimen, and as a pharmacist I was not about to let that happen, nor would I allow it to happen if a similar situation arose in the future.  Unsurprisingly, he wasn't having it, so we argued for a couple of minutes until he said something I'll never forget.  After everything negative in this story (the typical physician ignoring a pharmacist's concerns, the generic patient aggressively refusing counseling, and the classic corporate goon always taking the ""customer's"" side), what came out of his mouth next was somehow infinitely worse.

""If the patient refuses counseling and you document that, then you won't get sued even if she has an adverse reaction.  **So why do you care?**""

At this point I had already made the decision to enter medicine, but a manager directly instructing his pharmacist not to care about the health of his patients was further validation that I did not belong in this profession.  And the best (or worst, I suppose) part of all?

medicine,Doctors of Reddit in a Clinic Setting: In Need of Some Practical Advice on Being More Efficient with My Time and Setting Limits with Families,"I am a pediatrician in my 3rd year of practice, now 2nd job out of residency (moved to my hometown with my husband in effort to decrease stress in our lives) and I am struggling to find ways to be more efficient in my office visits but strike the balance of being compassionate with my families as I am building up my practice again. My question to doctors of reddit: what practical things do you do in your day of seeing patients to help minimize the work you do at the end of the day (how far you run behind, how many charts you have left to finish, phone calls, etc) but still maintain a loyal patient population?

&amp;#x200B;

**Some background**: I work at a larger organization, salary is based on production, I have been at this position for just nine months now and under a salary guarantee for the first year (was at my last position exactly one year).  I work 4.5 days a week (full FTE is 37 patient face-to-face hours which is what that is). I just switched my schedule from all 30 minute appointments to 20 minute appointments with 40 minutes for mental health consults (one at the end of my morning, one at the end of my day) and 40 minutes for my well teenager visits. This was in efforts to increase my production. My organization uses Epic as our EHR and just made this transition this year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Areas where I struggle:** 

1) Part of what I try to do is listen to my families and help them feel heard, which is a common complaint I hear from them about their prior experiences with other providers. Unfortunately I have a tough time cutting them off and this leads to me running behind and feeling frantic the rest of the day. How do you set limits with families when they want to talk about other medical problems in a problem-focused or well visit that is not what the appointment is schedule for?

2) How do you chart throughout your day to decrease the work you do at the end of your day? What things have you ""let go of"" in terms of detail in your charting? 

3) Where do you set limits in your schedule and how does your staff support you to make the day run smoother?

4) How do you handle late patients and no-shows?

5) If you could start fresh with the way you practice, what would you do differently?",29,102,2018-09-03,PHARMA,0.04136943072080612,0.9119421243667603,0.04668844863772392

medicine,Thoughts on Disability Insurance,"I recently started GI fellowship, and we've had a few speakers come in from outside companies (financial advisors who specialize in money management/insurance/etc for doctors) speak to us about disability insurance and the importance of getting it early.

They state that enrolling in disability insurance when you are a fellow (i.e. when you make much less money than you would as an attending and when you are younger) is better because the underwritten policy takes into account your health, age, and current benefits at that time, and then it can be scaled up without a new evaluation once you become an attending (translating to cheaper monthly premiums in the future).

This makes sense, but I wonder if it's worth it to have (in addition to what's offered by the hospital) as a new fellow for the following reasons:

1. The policies seem to start around $500/month, which seems like a lot to pay a month when you could invest that money instead
2. If you don't really have much in the way of financial responsibility (i.e. kids, significant debt), then do you really need the security of those monthly benefits for the price? 
3. It seems like the chance that one would actually become disabled to the point where he/she could not work AT ALL is pretty slim. Even if one lost functionality of his/her hands, it would still be possible to see patients in clinic and round. This is obviously different for surgeons since they need their hands to make a living, but for medicine specialists I'm not sure how much it applies. 

It does seem like if you enroll at least 6 months prior to ending fellowship, you can get a ""fellowship rate"" that might be slightly more expensive than it would if you got it earlier, but still good in the long-term because you would save money monthly down the road as your income jumps as an attending. 

Wondering what everyone's thoughts are on the subject",53,50,2018-09-07,PHARMA,0.03361878544092178,0.9263021349906921,0.040079038590192795

pharmacy,The mystery of the disappearing ink,"I had a great day yesterday. Ill tell you why

A patient comes in and demands to speak to the pharmacist.  The patient describes that he gave us his prescription two days ago for his Norco and decided not to fill with us since we did not have the right manufacture (you know, the yellow ones) so we gave it back to him promptly and he decided he wanted to go to walmart. On his way to walmart he had left his prescription in his car and when we went to fill it the ink was gone with just a blank prescription so he was unable to fill it and naturally felt he had been swindled by one of our techs. In our computer, it shows the scanned  prescription complete and filled out with two different inks. The doctor and patient info is filled out with blue ink and the prescription it self is filled out with darker blue. The best part is when he shows us the prescription the dark blue ink is gone basically it was blank prescription and he could have written anything he wanted to. He said the girl who took his prescription must have done something malicious with it and given him a fake. 

There are these pens called frixion pens which are marketed as erasable pens and they work with friction erasers which makes the ink disappear under high temperatures. I use to use them for organic chemistry and I remember I left my notes in the car one day and they completely disappeared from the page after doing a google search someone said you could reverse it by throwing it in the freezer and the ink would come back on the page. it saved me on my organic chem test. 

Anyway, I interrupt my pharmacist and the patient with a big smile on my face and say  ""Sir, let me put his prescription in the freezer!""

The patient and the pharmacist just stare at me like I must have been huffing glue but they were arguing at this point because the floater cant speak to malicious intent and cant explain what could have happened while the patient is in a lot of pain and wont be able to fill a prescription for his pain without being in indicted for forgery if someone caught it. 

Sure enough I throw that shit in the freezer and voila! While walking back from the freezer I kept the prescription held to my chest and flicked it twice and said PRESTO! and turned it towards him revealing the ink. 

His dumb ass doctor is using erasable ink to fill out C2 prescriptions...how in the world does that not strike them as negligence waiting to happen. 

P.S. The patient himself was very nice throughout our interaction and had every right to be mad, maybe not with us,  but I think anyone could see why he thought it was us.",11,134,2018-09-09,PHARMA,0.09391359239816666,0.8801801800727844,0.02590622380375862
medicine,Revisiting the Causes of Death in Residency (2017 article). What about the 61 questionable deaths?,"Wanted to re-post an article that came out last year; there was a thread on this in 2017 but it’s been archived.

https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00001888-201707000-00041

I wrote the authors this letter below and would love to hear your thoughts:

For the authors,

This letter is a strong plea to address the shortcomings of the paper: 
Causes of Death of Residents in ACGME-Accredited Programs 2000 Through 2014.

The paper concludes the leading cause of death among residents to be neoplastic disease, followed by suicide, a statement repeated multiple times throughout the conclusion and discussion. If not for this small paragraph in the results section (see below), readers would have no reason to question such certainty.

“Twenty-two residents (19 men, 3 women), including 12 anesthesiology residents, died by accidental poisoning. The deaths of an additional 11 residents (9 men, 2 women) occurred under circumstances of unclear intent (5 of these deaths by falls and 6 by poisoning), and 7 residents (4 men, 3 women) were victims of homicide. For 28 residents (22 men, 6 women)—including 13 residents that could not be matched to NDI or public data, and 15 with NDI records—the cause of death was classified as ill-defined or undetermined intent.”

When I read this—22 residents died by accidental poisoning, 11 by “unclear intent” including falls and poisoning, and another 28 classified as “ill-defined or undermined intent”—that makes a total of 61 deaths that occurred under questionable circumstances.  

Where is the information about the 12 anesthesiology residents that died by “unintentional poisoning?” Were these residents clinically depressed? And what did the friends and families have to say about the deaths of all of those with “undetermined intent,” whether by falls or poisoning?

The paper concludes that 66 residents died by suicide making it the second leading cause of death, but what about the 61 unclassified or questionable deaths lurking in the paragraph quoted above? They are missing from the discussion and almost suspiciously absent from the paragraph addressing this study’s limitations.

I ask that you address this.",26,71,2018-09-09,PHARMA,0.2448841780424118,0.7369566559791565,0.018159152939915657

medicine,"What if your low-risk patient wants all the STD tests you offer, and he's paying?","It makes sense to deny patient requests for inappropriate tests. **Even when they are paying out-of-pocket**.

There are many reasons for this, including protecting patients from inappropriate spending, protecting healthcare resources from being diverted from those who actually need it, protecting patients from damage caused by lengthy, invasive, risky work-up. Also, perhaps, because doctors are trusted professionals who aren't meant to sell services indiscriminately on request. Medicine is paternalistic and doctors are gatekeepers, and rightly so.

A friend of mine recently went to a clinic to get STD testing. He had to fill out a questionnaire to assess his risk and eligibility for testing. He wanted to pay for more tests than they would approve, and after speaking with the office manager and explaining that he was paying up-front, he was still denied testing.

Most STDs have straightforward testing and treatment (Not looking at you, HPV). Surely there's not a lot of risk granting the testing if the patient wants it? Doctors of Reddit, why such barriers to STD testing?",169,203,2018-09-10,PHARMA,0.08956389874219894,0.881257176399231,0.029178941622376442

medicine,I am having a hard time with patients threatening to leave AMA to leverage non-indicated meds. When and what are the proper steps for AMA-discharges?,"I’m an intern at a large academic medical center, and rotate on several high-volume services. Based on the catchment area, we get a decent chunk of underserved patients. On my rotation, many of the patients I have admitted have turned out to be (previously documented) medication non-compliant, pain-seeking, drug-seeking, refusing X (usually vitals, morning meds, etc). When I go to talk to them about it, they escalate this to ""I'm not taking X, until I get \_\_\_\_ insert opioid-of-choice/klonipin/IV benadryl. If you can't give me that, I'm leaving.""

&amp;#x200B;

My senior wants me to do “everything we have to” to keep these people in the hospital without caving to their demand for non-indicated meds. Personal feelings on this aside, a result, I end up bedside counseling some of them up to an hour-per-day, day-after-day. I get the legal aspect of AMA discharges, but on the personal side, it’s kind of frustrating being cursed at, punched (x1), and refused basic things like vitals and BP meds over and over by people who come to the hospital and refuse basic medical care. That plus the already baseline craziness of intern year, and I end up getting out very, very late. I’m happy overall with my program (at least as relatively happy as one can be as an intern), but they won’t really provide clear guidelines for situations for discharging patients AMA.

&amp;#x200B;

biotech,Biotechnology Scientists of Bay Area. How much do you get paid?,"## 

Hello. I am searching for new opportunities and I was trying to get a gauge of what typical pay is for a Research Associate III or Scientist I position for both contractor AND full time employee (with benefits). I have been out of the job market for awhile, so I am not sure what the current rate is in the bay area/San Francisco.

It would be awesome if you sum up how long you have worked in the industry and what you do.

Personally I have been working in research for 10 years. 5 in academia, and 5 at a very established (like a Walmart of biotech) company. My most recent industry experience is in RD and VV on qPCR and NGS platforms. To sum up my level of autonomy, I can design, analyze, and write reports on my own experiments most of the time, with some general guidance from my manager. I can do enough stats to figure out if things are significantly different from each other, but I certainly cannot script/code. Other experience includes working with animals, cells, protein, DNA/RNA, managing bioregistry.

I plan on applying to Research Associate III or Scientist 1 level positions.

We in Houston STILL have a difficult time managing staff and the logistics of riding out the storm.

I wanted to share a little bit about my experience riding out Hurricane Harvey, which sounds almost identical to the storm coming for the East coast.

Communicate with your leardership! even in Houston where we are hit year after year by massive Hurricanes and floods there are still hospital shortfalls in managing staff! They call into place emergency evacuation plans WAY too late (probably to save money and/or out of sheer incompetence). Hopefully the management out there is better and more proactive in this stance but **figure out who is staying and who is leaving**

**Prepare a suitcase!** -Pack for a week and prep like you are going camping indoors

-games (you will have downtime and lots of staff around bored to tears), snacks and food you like (we ran out of food at our hospital during Harvey with no way to deliver to us), pillows and toiletries.

-sleeping aid (whatever it takes to fall asleep, it was harder than I thought it would be to sleep overnight at the hospital. Very uncomfortable mattresses and LOTS of noise) so maybe earplugs and nyquil

**Expect the unexpected** At our hospital everything that could have went wrong during the storm really did. Prepare to stay longer than told (many will have a hard time getting back to the hospital when the roads are shut down)

**Park your vehicles and your families vehicles up high in a garage Paying the hefty parking fee is way better than replacing a vehicle**

pharmacy,Has anyone else experienced this? In search of some advice,"Typing this on my phone so please forgive the typos. To give some background I recently graduated in May. I went to a well respected program that has been around over a century. I passed my boards with no problems. My rotations were at larger hospitals where I was challenged. I believed I grew a great deal. I recieved good feedback from all my preceptors and was able to adjust and improve my skills. I always left with glowing reviews. 

Currently, I am a PGY1 resident at a large hospital system. I am struggling to say the least. I have multiple projects and deadlines running simultaneously that I am not accustomed to. I am someone who generally takes more time than my peers to write papers, work on projects, etc. In the past this was okay, but now I am staying much later to work on projects. I do not mind spending the extra time, but it is getting to the point that I was working until 1am or later every night. My coresidents are able to get done with most of their work by 8pm because they are much more efficient and likely have a bit more experience in the field the projects are in also. I have been trying to improve my speed, which is helping but the quality of my work is taking a noticeable hit. To sum this up, I am experiencing a lot of stress at work, recently. I also have some stress with my significant other recently as I am not able to spend time with them. Stress is to be expected this year. In the past stress and anxiety has not been an issue for me. Which brings me to the issue I'm seeking advice on...

For the last few months I have been experiencing an entirely new phenomenon. When asked a question that requires critical thinking my mind all of the sudden just blanks. I sometimes would not even be able to repeat the question back. I have never felt like this before. I feel like I am developing short term memory loss. It has been begining to worry me. I seem like I have all of my thoughts clear in my head about a patient case then a preceptor asks me what the plan is and I start to blank. I have to constantly look at the notes I took. When asked a lab value that I knew 3 seconds ago, I now have to find it on my paper as I simply cannot recall it. I read things off my paper wrong such as stating to increase a patients Lantus when they are on Levemir. I am forgetting things that I would never think I would need to write down. I have left my coat behind three times this week and didn't realize until I was out the door. I am all around flustered, and I have absolutely not been like this in the past. My performance reviews are not great, I am trying my best to improve and get more sleep. The memory issue has persisted. I am begining to feel more anxious because I'm scared that once of these lapses could cause patient harm. 

At first I truly believed it was lack of sleep. I have made it a priority to get at least 7 hours the last 10 days, and the issue has persisted and progressed somewhat. 

I know this is a vague tale of struggle, but these memory issues seem so far removed from the person I was at the end of April. 

Has anyone experienced this issue before? How did you overcome it?

medicine,Apologies on behalf of my ignorance/administrators.,"I  weighed in briefly on a post yesterday regarding nursing ratios,  since I am not 100% aware of clinical variations in hospitals, it was good to read about how bad some hospitals are in the country. My main concern wasn't about the ratio - it was mostly around the rule going live in 3 months and that non-abiding hospitals are charged $25k/day as a penalty  (not sure where that $ is going, I'm guessing to the state fund?). I  want to leave that issue aside though, since it's not why I'm posting.

I  didn't realize how many providers truly HATED non-clinicians. They say  when you've worked in one hospital, you've worked in one hospital.  That's true for me (I've only been at one institution), but I feel like  my organization does generally a good job in supporting clinical staff  based on my conversations with them, and I guess I don't know what it's  like in other hospitals where your management team really just is about  nothing but money.

Anyway, after being  told that I'm a parasite, a leech, etc. it seems clear to me that  administrators as a whole have to do better.

I  don't know where these admins come from that make you treat patients  differently based on ability to pay (we blind our docs to that  information) and I'm truly sorry any time that you've had someone tell  you how to do your job, disrespected you, or took the joy out of caring  for patients. I've only been in this industry for one year, and I find reading through comments about burnout, ratios, even just random  clinical issues to be really interesting and reflects a great community.

I'm  assuming this might be downvoted to oblivion, since I'm just an admin.  But the conversation has to start somewhere, and I hope that I can take  lessons from here on what NOT to be and we can work together to help  patients. Thank you.

EDIT: I appreciate all of the feedback. I know many of you have been in the trenches for years (dozens of years?), and I'm a desk jockey with literally a year of work experience under my belt in healthcare finance. I plan on going through the comments a bit more in detail, reaching out to some of our doctors and nurses I know to shadow them in the early mornings, and advocating more strongly when I hear anything about requiring further metric measurement (not that I have any real power, but better than just sitting there silently)...I hope that my curiosity in these issues comes across as genuine.

I do think good administrators add value (though no doubt there is bloat, and it is probably worse in some depts than others). There are regulatory requirements, payer nonsense, HR, IT, etc. that all organizations need, one way or another. But it seems many of us have strayed further than others from the core mission of taking care of our people, so they can take care of patients. 

Above all, thank you for healing patients amidst all the hurdles you face. I hope that you know that at least one admin, as junior as he may be, respect all of you and hope to learn from you in the future.",93,365,2018-09-15,PHARMA,0.043466486036777496,0.9193791747093201,0.037154342979192734

pharmacy,"Vent: I was really just trying to make sure you didn’t die, lady.","Maybe more appropriate on Tales from the Pharmacy, but I need to vent about an experience that will almost be guaranteed to get me a complaint. 

An infrequent customer presented a new Rx for oxycodone 30 mg TID, 28 day supply from a pain management clinic located pretty far from us. The customer also didn’t live close by but occasionally fills scripts with us. I checked her profile, PMP’d her, did the required checklist that corporate makes us do to reduce liability on them for filling “target drugs” and found that she had not filled any sort of opioid Rx since April, with us or at any pharmacy in the state. 

So I told her that I wanted to speak to the prescriber before I would be able to fill the Rx because I was concerned about the dosage. She took the script back, I figured she’d just go try to get it somewhere else. Instead she sits in the waiting room with another person who’d come in with her running her mouth louder and louder about how “the pharmacist doesn’t know as much as the doctor, it’s their job to just fill the prescription,” etc. 

My tech asked if she could help them further, and then the patient’s friend started yelling at me across the waiting area about how I didn’t know what the script was for and was just being judgmental. I made another attempt to explain how I felt going immediately to 90mg of oxy a day was too much for an opioid naive patient. They then thought I was calling them naive and everything just sort of devolved from there. 

It just really pissed me off since I’m not one of those pharmacists that lies to people about having meds in stock if it’s a shady prescription. I’ll be straight up and tell them why I’m not filling it. Most people don’t try to argue, they just take it elsewhere. In this case I was genuinely concerned for the amount of medication this lady had been prescribed and by expressing that to her, apparently I was being “judgmental.” My tech even said I was as nice as I could have been, so idk, screw it. I just know the store manager is going to grill me about what I could’ve done differently to make the patient happy... pretty sure in this case the only answer would’ve been filling the damn Rx.",32,117,2018-09-16,PHARMA,0.08321577310562134,0.8864395618438721,0.03034471906721592

medicine,Women Physicians: considering the impact of a medical career on family and relationships...would you do it again?,"**To all my lovely ladies out there, looking back, do you regret pursuing medicine when you look at the impact it had on starting a family and your relationships? I'd like to start a family someday, preferably by my early 30s, and the more I read articles and hear stories from my mentors, the more I think that this ideal is almost impossible in medicine.**

Throughout my undergrad, I was always focused on getting into medical school, resume, the pre-med stereotype. I never placed much value on pursuing boys or relationships, believing that if I focused on my personal development, I would find the right guy eventually.  That said, I also value the idea of one day starting a family and having the privilege actually be there to raise my kids. So I guess medicine appeals to me two-fold: it's a career dedicated to helping people (which speaks for itself), but also promotes decent job/financial stability that will inevitably prove helpful in starting a family and generally living a stable life.

&lt;Which brings me to my little crisis as to if medicine is truly the right place for me as I turn 22 (right after starting at a Top 10 medical school, good timing I know). I'm smart, accomplished, and pretty enough, yet never have even had  a serious boyfriend. I keep making excuses for myself: ""You'll find the right guy next year""; ""They say you'll find Mr. Right when you least expect it"".  But it's been 4 years of this...and no dice. So I guess I'm starting to feel discouraged and a bit lonely too, especially as friends from undergrad go on to start their first jobs in the workforce. Sometimes people joke that I'll be single forever, and while I know they mean it lightly, the thought terrifies me.

So, I'm asking all my female docs in residency and attendings out there: if you could go back, would you do this again? Or would you pursue PA, or perhaps even a completely different field like engineering, where you have similar financial stability but more time for yourself.

**Also: It should go without saying that I'm not trying to to say that every woman necessarily needs a family and husband to feel fulfilled.** Some of my most inspiring female mentors have neither, but at least for my personal values, this is something that I would one day like to have in my life.

**EDIT/DISCLAIMER:** I am not at all saying that I want a life with no hardship and I want to spend my entire life raising kids. Just, no. I love medicine, I'm passionate about it, I love science, everything about M1 is crazy exciting to me.That however, does not mean that I don't want to have more than just science and academics and platonic friendships in my life ten years from now. Consequently, I've been educating myself on what life would look like because I know its a long path ahead, and honestly many of the articles I've read on female physician work-life balance are crazy discouraging.

pharmacy,"New pharmacy intern at walgreens, couple of nooby questions","Hi I started working as a intern this week and got a couple of questions that may sound stupid...my coworkers seem bothered when I ask too many questions so I just want to make sure I'm getting on the right track.

1) When looking at the patient profile with a patient that has a refill on a medication available, is their most recent ""last fill date"" of that medication the day that their prescription was ready to be refilled? So if it says one of their medication's ""last fill date"" is 9/10/2018 as and the status is: ""refill"", that means they could have refilled it 5 days ago? Then when the prescription is sold the ""last fill date"" will change to 9/15/2018(the date its sold) with the status showing the # of refills remaining?

2) What are reasons prescriptions are put in the stored status other then the patient hasn't picked up their prescription in x amount of days? Are we usually always able to fill a prescription that is in the stored status for a patient that requests it?

3)What causes a prescription to be closed or in the CL status.

4)What are the steps that pharmacists take when analyzing a controlled prescription and determining whether to accept it for the patient. I know generally they look at the central profile, see their fill history for that medication, but what are some red flags to consider?

5)When running insurance on a patient, I enter the bin and PCN number, but when I search often times there are dozens of insurance codes that pop up. What are tips for accurately choosing the correct insurance using the BIN/PCN number when there's so many to choose from? Also if you have advice on troubleshooting some common insurance errors that would be helpful.

6)Daily operational tasks that techs are responsible for: 7 day call backs, smart counts, deletes, bin reconciliation(weekly). What else am i missing and should ask about so I could get a good head start on getting good at these.

I've been trying to keep up, but it just stresses me so much when my colleagues (who are much older pharmacists who have been working there for at least 10 years) train me. Although nice people, I get the feeling that they think I'm incompetent (?), when the reality is that I'm just somewhat overwhelmed with everything being thrown at me all at once, and that stress (on top of me being an already anxious person at baseline) makes me mess up sometimes, which in turn makes them think that I'm not picking stuff that they taught me before and that kind of frustrates them, and their frustration frustrates me. I usually feel so exhausted and have no energy by the end of the day because of this. 

Can anyone give me any advice at all about this? Is it me, is it them, is it the setting or is this just how hospital training is like?",36,65,2018-09-18,PHARMA,0.12834574282169342,0.8388953804969788,0.03275889903306961

Grant William Robicheaux, 38, and Brea resident Cerissa Laura Riley, 31, worked in tandem, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said Tuesday at a news conference announcing charges against the couple in connection with two alleged assaults. Rackauckas said there may be more victims, citing “thousands” of videos and photos on Robicheaux’s phone, many showing highly intoxicated women.

Secondly is Costco's pharmacy business sustainable? With retail everywhere feeling the squeeze I have trouble imagining their operations will be lasting especially given their reported tech salaries and high staffing levels, lack of metrics, lack of immunization push, no MTM. I get that pharmacy isnt their core business and likely just a loss leader for convenience but do businesses always looking to increase revenues and profitability for shareholders really continue this segment?

medicine,Having an existential crisis and feeling like what we do in medicine is pointless,"I'm a new resident/intern and I've been having somewhat of a existential crisis.

More and more, as I see more patients and witness more suffering, I feel like there is no inherent value to human life. I have always kind of felt that way, and I am an atheist so I don't believe there's a higher power that we live for. We are experiencing a population crisis in the world and yet it seems like no matter how much suffering a person must endure (through illness, poverty, disability, etc) society as a whole feels that every single human life is worth living and saving, even thought there's billions of humans.

I also believe that there's no inherent purpose to morality (ex. the belief that murder is bad) other than to create a society/system in which the human species can continue to propagate successfully.

Given these beliefs, I find my job as a doctor pointless sometimes. I don't know why we try so hard to prolong human life for some people with irremediable suffering. I don't know why we hold suicidal patients against their will, when some people clearly have such shitty lives that they just don't want to live anymore and yet we force them to live against their will in a psych ward until they no longer want to kill themselves. I actually feel strongly about providing abortion and euthanasia to allow people to live meaningful lives and not force life to come into existence.

Does anyone ever feel this way? I have been kind of looking up these feelings and I think it's most in line with moral nihilism...

To be clear, I don't necessarily feel depressed. This is actually just what I believe. I don't want to end my life, because I still possess the biological drive to survive, but I also feel like I no longer believe in what I do.",107,106,2018-09-20,PHARMA,0.047141771763563156,0.9165606498718262,0.03629753366112709

I still do not have specific field of interest and my lab experiences were till now pretty dull and boring. I find stuff like bacterial cell culturing, protein purification, DNA extraction, PCR, etc. to be really boring. But the thing is that all of labs I've worked on (my college and an internship) were of poor quality and the research being done there was very unappealing to me (I'm from India). I considered MS Biotechnology which is a PSM course and found it as a perfect balance between industry and research. But recently I've found out not many MS Biotech PSMs are tailored for fresh graduates; some are for 'working professionals'. So that leaves me with very limited options, which can be either a good thing (less confusion) or a bad thing (high uncertainties as I don't know much about regulatory jobs). I would also like to add that I have no programming experience.

medicine,To the family of my patient -,"To the family of my patient who died today - I'm sorry what we had to give wasn't enough. I promise we gave 110% to your loved one. We didn't go through all this training just to have our knowledge and work be futile. It broke our hearts to be unable to fix what was irrevocably broken.

I know you accused us of giving up because your heart was breaking. I know this was probably one of the worst days of your life, and I promise to you, it was one of mine too. I know you wanted everything done, but doing everything broke our spirits bit by bit, knowing that what we were doing was causing pain and suffering. Sometimes everything is too much, and yet will never be enough. All I wanted to do after your loved one died was to hug and cry with you, to say I'm sorry.

But I didn't want you to think we didn't try; that somehow we needed to say I'm sorry for not doing something. So instead I cried while writing my notes and finishing up work I had been unable to do the rest of the day because I spent most of the day trying to keep your loved one alive.

So, instead I'll say it here: to the family of my patient who died today - I'm sorry, and know that I cried for your loved one too.

Excuse me for my poor intern sleep deprived stream of consciousness. 

It's starting to hit me that the roughest part is that you can't really walk away cause that means someone could die. 
In other jobs, when you're fed up, you can just say screw it, I'll get back to it when I feel more up to it. And in some other jobs, even if you don't, it'll eventually be okay cause at least it's not the end of the world for someone. Not the case for medicine. Knowing the buck stops at you can be overwhelming sometimes. I'm glad I'm still training and I have backup, but man, does it sometimes hit hard. And it's harder when you know maybe the best thing to do is to stop - that you've hit the limits of what medicine can provide - but you're still obligated to do so because we as a society haven't really come to terms with dying gracefully. And even rougher still is wanting to mourn the loss of a life with the family and your coworkers, but work pulls you in a thousand other different directions because you still have to make sure you give it your all for all the others you are responsible for.",39,432,2018-09-24,PHARMA,0.13226646184921265,0.8356943726539612,0.03203915059566498

pharmacy,Why I was fired from Walgreens,"About a year ago, I got my first job as a pharmacist out of school.  It was as a floater for Walgreens in the Quad Cities.  It's a group of cities along the Mississippi River, in Illinois and Iowa.  I'll try to keep this story as short as possible, while still accurately telling what happened.  During my week-long training, the manager warned me that some of the stores wrote up previous floaters that they didn't like.  It's a good time to mention that during my interview, the district manager asked if I'd be willing to occasionally do overnight shifts and sometimes travel up to an hour away.  I agreed, but he mentioned that the previous floater that they had agreed too, but eventually complained that they didn't like the night shifts, and was later fired for something or another.  Looking back, that should have been a major red flag, but I was having a tough time finding a job so I didn't think much of it.  One tech told me that they had some terrible floaters recently.  Let me tell you the events that led up to my firing and then the conversation I had with the district manager.

  The problems really started with one store.  I was working the weekend shifts every three weeks or so at one particular store.  Well, one of the techs didn't like me, and one day asked me, ""what you think you're too good for that, you think you're better than the techs.""  I didn't even respond, it was just too crazy. That's not me at all.  I was working hard and doing everything.  There's a lot more I could say about that store, but I will just say it was pretty insane what happened there.  That's an entirely different story.  I only bring that up because a couple weeks before I was fired, a tech at a different store said they were ""warned"" about me, and used that exact phrase. That was about one and one-half to two months later.  Between that time, some techs were being quite rude to me.  I just thought that was how they treated floaters.  I didn't realize they were spreading rumors/lies about me like that.

  Now on to my conversation with the district manager.  We went to the office and sat down.  He told me that the stores didn't like me and he had received a lot of complaints from them.  I'll just tell you what happened, and what he told me they said.  At one store, there was a dry erase board labeled ""quick wins.""  So being me, I drew a quick game of tic-tac-toe.  The DM told me that the pharmacist the next day was ""very upset"" and that I spent a bunch of time playing games on their dry erase board.  ""You mean the quick game of tic-tac-toe I drew?""  ""Yes, she was very upset.""  Next, he said that I made a customer feel uncomfortable while asking about her STD med.  Any guesses what really happened?  Well, one time I received a call from a doctor's office asking if acyclovir was safe in a pregnant woman with shingles.  How often does that happen?  A couple hours later, a pregnant woman came in with a new prescription for acyclovir.  I was kind of looking forward to talking to her about how I talked to her doctor and that it would be perfectly safe in pregnancy.  Well, I definitely made her uncomfortable when I asked her, ""and what did the doctor tell you this was for?""  thinking for sure it was for shingles.  It wasn't.  But I quickly recognized I made her uncomfortable, and explained the situation.  She said she understood, and all was well.  The tech who reported this to the manager knew the reason I asked her, and knew I resolved it, yet still reported that, leaving out all of the context.                                                       

  This last story...if you asked me what was my greatest experience as a pharmacist, it'd be this story.  I was working the overnight shifts the entire week before Christmas Eve.  So I had been planning something for Christmas Eve, I was going to buy toys for any sick children that might come through that day.  At around 3 am when the store was completely dead on Christmas Eve, I went to the toy aisle, and picked out some toys.  I went to the front of the store, paid for them and went back to work. It didn't take long, probably like 5 minutes time.  I unwrapped the toys every once in a while, and left them in different places on the counters.  It didn't take much time.  At around 4 pm, a family came through the drive-through with a sick little 4 year old girl.  After I gave them her meds, I said ""hold on a sec.""  I grabbed one of the toys off of the counter and told them, ""Santa knew you were going to be here and left this toy for you.""  I've never seen people so genuinely happy.  It was really special.  Well, the staff there reported to the DM that I spent the night playing with toys.  Honestly, I was a little disappointed I didn't have time to play with the thunder rumbler.

  And now I can't get a job anywhere.  People probably see that I was let go from Walgreens after just 6 months and think the worst.  There were other complaints, but they were all similar to what I've told.   I'm writing this so people know what's going on in those stores, mostly so it doesn't happen to other pharmacists.  I'm also writing this in the hopes that someone is hiring or knows someone that is hiring in the area.",113,197,2018-09-25,PHARMA,0.10439367592334747,0.8673640787601471,0.02824224252253771

I’ve been with my current employer for a year now. Im an employed physician in an outpatient FM clinic for a hospital system. My one year guarantee is up and I’m currently in talks with employer about extending guarantee as the numbers have not picked up as they thought they would. Two providers were hired on at once and we have been struggling to keep numbers up. 

I received an email today saying that our office administrator and the VP of Physician Financial Services (whatever that is) want to “round” with me on Thursday for an hour. At first I was thinking ‘well, whatever’ but the more I think about it, the more I’m actually offended. 

I understand that they are trying to decide whether or not to make an investment in extending my guarantee but at the same time, are they questioning my judgement/patient interaction? I’m a board certified physician. What training does this BS vp have?

medicine,American Medical Association being Unreasonable,"Hi all, first time posting here.

Anyway, so I was a member of the AMA few years back in medical school for the benefits (discounted books, etc, etc), when I started residency I didn't see a need for it so I been an inactive member for the past few years.

Fast forward to now. I'm applying for state license (different state then I'm currently a resident in) because I'll be done with residency next June. I get a email from the licensing board telling me that everything was good except that my AMA profile had an incorrect random state license (AMA had put it there by mistake). So my first thought was, ""huh AMA collected my information?"" But its whatever so I called them to tell them that it is incorrect and they agreed to remove it. However, they told me that it would cost 40 dollars to sent a official corrected report to that particular state board or 45 dollars for me to join AMA (which i can send unlimited copies).

I told them that was ridiculous, first off I didn't even know AMA to collected my information in the first place (its probably in the fine print somewhere when I had signed up in medical school). Second and more importantly\*\*, I don't understand why I would have to pay the cost for a mistake on the AMA's part, they kept telling me to join AMA for 45 dollars a year so I can send unlimited reports.\*\* I have already spoken with 2 customer representative and it seems like they are hellbent on getting me to pay 40 or 45 dollars. I really don't want to pay them out of principle. I already wasted a ton of time trying to reason with them. Its likely that I'll end up paying them just to get licensing process over with. But super frustrating being essentially coerced by one of the largest medical organizations in the world.

Just want to put a disclaimer that this is something I will NO WAY talk about with a patient or incorporate in my current clinical practice in any shape or form since there is no high quality data, and I definitely have a very healthy sense of skepticism about it given the latest Aspirin study.

&amp;#x200B;

There are multitude of animal studies supportive of increased longevity, and even some shaky evidence that it may be beneficial in human as well! In fact, there are clinical trials going. A good summary article is included below by the Einstein group.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

While for almost every other system/biochemistry, I truly believe that our own body fined tuned by evolution is the best without interventions, I understand that trait for longevity is not selected by evolution as much since the goal of evolution is to produce offsprings that are able to reproduce. In fact, our environment is very much different from the environment of our ancestors, and could we altered our biochemistry in a way that we are less tolerant of starvation due to failed hunts but also decrease our oxidative stress?

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think of the whole metformin situation? Is this a medication that one can take for decades without significant side effect even if not strictly currently indicated? Is it worth to change oneselve's metabolism to hope to win the longevity lottery?

medicine,At what point do we accept that 0/10 pain for everyone is an absolutely unreasonable goal?,"I work with injury and accident patients, and one of the biggest things that I get asked in deposition, by management as well as by insurance companies is ""What's the level of their pain?"".

Anything other than 0/10 pain at discharge gets me questions from management. 

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry this patient with no discernible organic cause for pain keeps complaining of 8/10 pan-body pain, despite negative imaging, a negative EMG, negative exam findings, negative lab findings. I'm not going to medicate someone for the rest of their lives without a reason why.

I'm sorry this 91 year old patient with a history of arthritis will still have pain. Really I am. However, what am I supposed to do?

Why on Earth did we decide that a nebulous, self-defined ""fifth vital sign"" should be treated as gospel?

I keep it clean, well groomed, oiled, taken care of, and all, but I'm worried I'd be asked to cut it off for my neurosurgery rotation (which starts in about a month's time). To be clear, I wouldn't mind wearing some kind of gel/masks on it, that's not a big deal. I just don't think I can afford removing it (emotionally speaking). I've been thinking of cutting some length off (maybe half way) to make it more passable.

medicine,To my patient who died today -,"Today, I pronounced my first death, on my own. This young patient was one whom I held dear - I had seen them in the ED a few weeks ago, and inherited them when I got to the MICU.

To my patient who died today - I know you didn’t want to come into the hospital and you wanted to be able to go home if you could. I had hoped we could fix you up a bit so you could peacefully spend as much time as you could with your young spouse and kids. But we just couldn’t fix you enough; you were too sick.

Here you were, in the ICU when I got there, weeks after I had first met you. Each day was a battle of trying to titrate drips, interpreting new scans, trying to fix the vent settings, postulating what new test or procedure to do to maybe help you get better. Yet, nothing helped. We had some “good” days, where you’d get to be more awake, but there were so many more bad days than the good.

At the end of the day, I don’t think what we did medically really helped much at all. It ultimately just prolonged your suffering.

Honestly, I think the most healing I got to do was to know more about you, your life, your accomplishments, your dreams. Getting to celebrate you with your spouse was the most healing that was happening in that room. Letting you die comfortably with dignity was the best medicine I ultimately could give. 

Thank you for healing me. Thank you for trying to know more about me as well. It’s incredible that even while you were intubated, while you were in pain, you made the effort to write to ask about me. Thank you for lighting up when I told you I was a foodie and that I’d love to try your food one day. Thank you for blessing me with your friendship. Thank you for forgiving me for convincing you to come into the hospital.

To my patient who died today - You fought a good fight, and lived more life than many could ever hope for. I hope you have peace, and may we all meet one day again.",35,962,2018-09-29,PHARMA,0.02753983624279499,0.904793381690979,0.06766684353351593

pharmacy,Approach for vaccinating difficult patients,"Im sorry this is so long. 

I’m a PY3 and have only been vaccinating for ~1.5 years. I work in a retail setting. Yesterday I had a couple bring their child in for a vaccine. I am generally adept at calming and reassuring children. I could not get this child to calm down. The parents tried distracting with a favorite YouTube video, I tried talking about interests of the child, nothing. Finally, we ended up with Dad holding the child in a bear hug and me clamped down on the child’s arm. This kid was terrified. The child still managed to escape my grip and Dad’s grip, bending the needle in their arm. I thank god it didn’t break. Afterwards, the parents disclosed this child has an intellectual disability that impacts the ability of the child to have emotional control, hence the extreme reaction of this child.

It was a terrifying experience for both me and the child. I was worried I was going to injure the child or that the needle was going to break off. I have no prejudice against people with mental or intellectual disabilities. However, I do not have staff or resources available to help me physically restrain a uncooperative patient.

I do not want to endanger or injure a child. At the same time, I have no desire to discriminate or appear to discriminate against people with mental or intellectual disabilities. Am I within my rights to refuse to vaccinate due to safety concerns?
