medicine,"PGY1, barely holding it together.","Not a throwaway because I just don't care anymore.

Been an intern since July in a subsurgical program I absolutely love, in a city I want to be in, and surrounded by close co-residents who are great. However, I feel like I'm keeping myself together by a thread.

Little about me: Had a ""break"" halfway through MS3 with sudden onset anxiety, derealization, and depersonalization. Could have been a combination of poor sleep, stress, etc. Strong sensations of derealization and depersonalization declined some over the following week. Since then I have been an absolute mess *outside of the hospital.* I mean this because I continued to achieve high marks for the duration of medication school, but inside, I felt miserable. Extreme fatigue regardless of my sleep schedule (i could sleep for days), cognitive dysfunction, short term memory loss, sometimes feeling like my body is made of lead. Trialed on multiple antidepressants without relief.

Banked on using the second half of 4th year to iron things out, sleep as much as i wanted, exercise more, etc. Didn't help.

Now, here I am in my third month of residency and I am absolutely miserable with the symptoms I previously described, but are worse. I work, come home, and sleep (i work out 3-4x per week), even on my incredibly light rotations. I'm not retaining information when I read, and I'm getting what feels like anxiety very easily. 

I need help. I *want* help. I cant get a psych appointment for over a month, even with utilizing wellness resources at the hospital. Nobody in my program knows, and I feel like I should talk to a faculty like an APD/PD, but I really dont know what good that will do for me. We're in the surgical field. Time off (like a few days) for any one person translates to double the work for everyone else. So why shine that light on me for the program to know?

I'm at a loss while in this holding pattern for my psych appointment but I really dont know how much longer I can handle feeling like this.

Any insight, recommendations, personal anecdotes would be accepted with open arms.

Thanks.",69,72,2017-09-01,PHARMA,0.08522958308458328,0.874152421951294,0.040617935359478

medicine,Treating medically literate patients-your thoughts?,"Hello all ye doctors,  
  
I am not one of you, but I am a physical therapist student about halfway through my program. I was wondering whether your interactions with medically literate patients (other doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, etc) are different than with the general public. Do you have more discussion about treatment and treatment options? Go more in depth? Allow for more ""shared decision making?"" I had seen a discussion here and in other places regarding how shared decision making was making your jobs more difficult by giving patients a false sense of confidence in their knowledge.  
Personally, I have been interested in medicine since I was a child and have been reading about it ever since I could read. I studied neuroscience and exercise science in college, but I did not go to medical school because I did not feel I could handle the pressures and instead went into a rehabilitation field. When I visit my primary doctor, we have fairly in-depth discussions about whatever issues I may have and will often share papers with each other and look things up together. I feel I lucked out with this doctor since she is willing to do this and give me more in-depth patient education than she probably does with most others. Do you do this with any of your patients? Do your medically literate patients demonstrate better or worse compliance with treatment plans?",33,43,2017-09-01,PHARMA,0.02879430167376995,0.9295995831489563,0.0416061133146286

i) Dispense Orapred (Prednisolone sodium phosphate).
ii)Tell patient you are out of stock and order the drug.
iii)Tell patient you have to check with the prescriber first and to come back the next day.
Note: Prednisolone sodium phosphate is not as bitter as plain prednisolone (so great for kids)  and has slightly less alcohol content (2% vs 5%). Can't think of other differences.

Allegedly, these nurses have been promoted to a point where they are too high level to be fired, yet don't actually contribute meaningfully to healthcare or to the hospital.

I can see how theoretically it's possible for this to happen at complex hospital systems, yet it seems almost like a ""too easy"" source of blame for health care costs, ie a large number of overpaid, useless people who ""if we could just get rid of would save millions.""

The program that I have landed in wants to place emphasis on the emotional and spiritual well being of staff as well as patients. Often the focus is entirely on patient and family, and to that end physicians and nurses are neglected to the point of breakdown. It's the principle that you cannot pour into someone else's cup if you are an empty pitcher. 
To that end I have a couple of questions that have been buzzing around my mind, and I was hoping you all might be willing to toss them around. 
When is a time when you wish that a chaplain had stopped to see if you were ok? Are there any scenarios in which it would be helpful to have a chaplain make sure the staff are alright as well as the family? (Patient loss? Etc?)

pharmacy,Student with worries about a situation at work today,"This happened just about 2 hours ago from this post.

An elderly later walked into our store half an hour before we were about to close. She presents with shortness of breath, appears flushed, somewhat altered mental status, and appears anxious. She asked me to take her blood pressure. I asked her to sit for about 5 minutes and took her pressure. Reading was roughly 200/100. I thought I might have mispositioned the cuff and took her pressure again on the other arm. Same result.

I told my pharmacist that I think it's a hypertensive crisis. She said to give it another 10 minutes or so and retake the pressure. I gave her some water, and tried to keep her calm and asked her about any medications she was possibly taking, which turns out to be a beta blocker and ACE for BP, and also found out she has DM and HLD. She also stated that when she took her blood pressure at home it was also around the ballpark of what we had, which was 200/100, but she thought her machine was malfunctioning because it was several years old. 

This all raised a red flag for me on top of the BP as I recalled learning in therapeutics that over even 160 it's extremely dangerous given age, medical history, etc. I took her BP again and got a reading average of mid 190s/100, negligible difference given possible error with our blood pressure unit. Pharmacist insisted that the lady went home and relaxed, and retake her BP again at home and if it remains over 180, to call 911. The lady went home and said she would do just that. 

She walked about 10 blocks to the nearest urgent care center which was closed, and her doctor could not be reached. 

It's worrying me sick that I maybe I should've been more adamant in calling 911 and getting help right away, and it might have been the proper thing to do against the words of my pharmacist. Should I have been more adamant about the situation? What could I have done better in this situation or what preventative measures should I have taken in this case given my position as a student? 

I just need to get this off my chest and this is the only place I could think of that could give me some rational and professional answer. I really hope she's okay",36,22,2017-09-04,PHARMA,0.1033044159412384,0.8685805201530457,0.02811512164771557

pharmacy,(CANADA) 5 years in - my experience as an independent owner,"So I posted this as a response to another post but think it could be a post by itself.


Here is a stream of conscious thoughts from an independent owner 5 years in.


Location is a small community but where most residents commute to a larger city for work so my competition is still the big chains, Costco, Walmart, Shoppers, even though my employee pool is smaller and salary costs are higher.  Total rented size 2500 sq feet.  Aim was for focus on providing excellent pharmaceutical service and having just enough on the floor to cover basic needs.


If I had to do it over I would go for 3000 sq ft to have 2 consultation offices instead of 1 so that I could rent out the 2nd office to another health professional (dietitian, nutritionist, nurse, ect) to help bring in traffic.  I would have a slightly larger storage room because I had no idea how much room stupid toilet paper, kleenex, paper towels and water bottles take up when a different brand is on sale every bloody week.  I would consider having my compounding/preparation area set up for sterile products.  I have already had to renovate to meet new guidelines (serious, stainless steel counters, gown, mask, hat to do a hemmoroid cream that the client is going to stick their finger in and wipe on their ass and that will expire in 28 days anyways!) - it might have made sense to to just put in a real fume hood and designate that corner for both compounding and sterile products as there are some good margins to be had and not many pharmacies do it.  I'm happy having a personal office that is not shared with other pharmacist employees.  I am happy having a computer workstation in the storage room.  Could have used 1 more aisle on the floor.


Starting out I was unprepared for the Human resource nightmares - honestly, it is 80-90% of the troubles  I have in my pharmacy and I was completely unprepared for it.  5 years in we have it under control with an excellent policy and procedures manual but building it through trial and error has been an unbelievable amount of work.


Try and find a mentor or two to help guide you through the process.  Pay them a consulting fee and it will be worth every penny.  Try to get someone else's employment manual and procedures manual that you can modify to your needs.  You want all your techs/pharmacists treating lost Rx, early narcotic renewal, insurance problems, ect the SAME UNIFORM way. 
You need to be a leader and set the standard for how your pharmacy is run and what sort of customer service you want to provide. 


You also need help on setting up your front store (are you going to be pharmacy only, small floor, large floor?), managing your accounting, payroll, ect.  Understand your labor laws and make sure you are signed up with all the relevant gov programs in advance of starting.


CONTROL your costs!  At the beginning and even 5 years in I survey the floor and maintain control.  If you are with a chain they are going to screw you on your stocks.  They use you as a warehouse and fill your shelves from front to back.  Yeah, I don't need 12 of every single variety of tylenol + every generic + + + when I am filling 25 Rx per day.  And 14 fleet enemas, really?!?  Stuff expires like crazy and you eat the cost.  Instead, as an independent, I would stock only 2 of every item and as soon as 1 sells order a replacement which arrives with the next days order.  This allows you to see what works in your area and what does not.  High selling products get stocked in larger quantities.  Any product that expires on the shelf without selling is removed from the planogram and never enters into my pharmacy again.  Baby food, I'm down to just 1 for emergencies, I can't compete on prices with Costco/Walmart so I will use my shelf space for something else. Keep your planogram's up to date, ""new"" products are coming out all the time (they change the packaging and advertise the stupid cream as ""new and improved"" all the time!).


I also worked to find products not generally stocked by my competitors (bio/natural cosmetics, face creams, ect) that have a good margin 30-40% markup and sell really well in my well off area.  


Paper products (klenex, toilet paper, ect) is a nightmare.  Every week a different brand is on sale in the flyer so you have to have huge stock but make essentially no profit because it is a stupid loss leader.  They are HUGE boxes and take up 50% of my storeroom space.  After 1 year my total profit on ALL paper products is around $600 TOTAL.  Makes me want to barf.


A good pharmacy technician is worth their weight in gold.  Pay them well.  I budgeted for a technician covering all hours from the start.  Sure doing 30 Rx per day is totally fine with just the pharmacist but you have 3 clients and a doc on the phone during the afternoon ""rush"" and all of a sudden you are bottle-necked.  You need those first clients to have excellent service right from the start so they switch from their established pharmacy.  Back to techs, trying to get enough to cover all the evening hours and weekends is tough.  You either try to get 2 full times to split evenings/weekends (and have high turnover because everyone hates evenings/weekends) or you have a core 9-5 team (better retention) and then have students cover evenings and weekends.  Problem with students is training them is a bitch and turn over is high as well and you keep having to start from scratch which is draining.  We have had best success by trying to get science/health program university students.  They have core competencies, comfortable with calculations and can memorize drug names so after 3-6 months they are competent and with a 4 year bachelor you can hope to keep them a while to recoup your training investment.  Be very discerning in interviews and we give them scenarios (looking for judgement) as well as practical tests (eg. calculate drug doses, ect).  This lets us see how they thing, can they calculate, are they detail oriented.  We do this for UNTRAINED techs and it has saved us several times from hiring someone who just can't do it at all.  Interviewing trained techs get different interview questions (more detailed toward pharmacy operations) but they get the same practical questions and blister pack as we have found some supposed trained techs suck too.


Cut your losses quickly.  Person can't handle criticism, is arrogant, can't calculate, ect.  Get rid of them quickly in the probation period, it will only get worse.  We have a concrete rule, if an employee starts coming home with us, their ass is fired (eg. we start talking about an employee repeatedly over dinner or in bed, they are GONE!) 


For part-time techs we have had best success with hiring young, smart kids for the cashiers on the floor and finding out over the months/years who is smart, hard-working and then bring them into the lab part-time for training and then when there is lab tech sick call or turn-over you have an immediate, trained replacement ready to go.  Our return on training investment is way higher on the kids we brought from floor to the lab than those who were hired directly into the lab.


Find out how your book-keeper and accountant wants your paperwork.  I send all my paperwork to my book-keeper BUT I also scan EVERY SINGLE invoice/bill/gov form, ect, (using paperport) and file them electronically by folder then date.  Eg. McKisson folder.  17-01-23.pdf.  This saves your ass when you get audited or need to find a bill from 2 years ago instead of having to dig through 100's of pounds of banker boxes to find the paper.  Also gives you a backup in case of fire/flood (I have local backup + encrypted cloud backup).


Good luck.  I have had problems with anticipated community growth in my area not happening at the speed projected.  Between the slow ramp up in prescriptions (110/day after 5 years), huge cuts by government, continued downward pressure from private insurance and competition from the big banners (Walmart, Costco, Shoppers) who use the pharmacy as a loss leader, it is VERY hard to make a profit offering quality pharmaceutical care.  I've been profitable since year 3 but so far I would have been better off financially having stayed an employee.  If a national pharmacare program comes out, if they switch to forcing clients to take 3 months at a time with only 1 dispensing fee, ect I will be in real trouble.  After 6 years the bank will be paid off, after 8 years my personal and partners financial contribution will be paid back.  BUT that will have been 8 years of taking $0 salary.  I'm not sure I will ever recoup that 8 year, $960,000 salary loss given the way the pharmacy field is moving.  


Add on the proposed Corp tax changes being proposed by Trudeau and you could say it is better to be an employee and when the key goes in the front door your brain can turn off.

medicine,Curious as to how others in healthcare conduct themselves...,"As healthcare professionals, when a close family member of yours is hospitalized, do you deliberately suppress making it known that you also work in healthcare, or do you make every effort to ensure that your loved one's healthcare team is aware of your knowledge/expertise?

The reason I ask is because my father is currently hospitalized. I am a nurse and so is my mother, but I have deliberately chosen to come at everything as if I'm seeing it with brand new eyes (not feigning stupidity or ignorance, mind you), however my mother has chosen to declare at almost every turn that she is a nurse and is well-versed in many things having to do with his care. 

I see pros and cons in both approaches. For one, the healthcare staff speaks to my mother in a more direct manner since they know she has a rudimentary understanding of basic principles and terminology, however they also seem more resentful when dealing with her (perhaps it's also the way she speaks with them, but that's a completely different discussion). For the most part, they appear to value her opinion more and take action with more gusto when she points out something. I don't know if this is out of respect, or out of fear that she'll report something that she sees is improperly executed. 

I, on the other hand, seem to be treated with more civility, and although I am included in relevant care discussions, I feel that my input doesn't have as much weight because I am perceived to be a layperson. It also seems that the healthcare staff isn't as rigid and anxious when I'm around, which in a way I feel is better as they seem more focused on caring for my father than impressing me. 

What do you all think?  Which is a better approach?  What have you done in the past when you've been in similar situations?  Thanks in advance for your input!",70,61,2017-09-07,PHARMA,0.038944944739341736,0.9248620867729187,0.03619297221302986

pharmacy,mylan brand epinephrine auto injectors vs brand epipen vs impax/other manufacturer generic,"So I work for a certain... 3 letter pharmacy.
 
I'm sure I'm not the only one fed up with this, but:

I had an 01 fill for epinephrine Mylan brand auto injector.  Not sure how it works in other retail pharmacies, but our particular company has implemented EXTENSIVE preventative measures from us filling anything other than the lowest cost autoinjector for the patient and more importantly, the pharmacy.

We already went through the adjudication requirements (which are RIDICULOUS) in order to get this patients first fill.  The prescriber wants a generic.  The patient's parent flat out refuses to get anything other than the Mylan brand generic and has returned the impax generic.

I should note that this patient has a 0 cost copay for this Mylan generic. 

STILL I had to sit on the phone for 10 minutes finagling ordering this second fill for Mylan generic without readjudicating (even though I had a helpful person on the line/was sympathetic) because there was a patient preference stop/IT'S THE SECOND FILL!! WITH PATIENT PREFERENCE!!

So, now for the question:

Is there anything specific you guys do in order to easily order the Mylan generic on subsequent fills?  Do you notate the initial rejections and costs in the notes?  Or do you just fudge the numbers like I did?  Or have you not yet run into this issue?

""Clinical review: Anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy - heparin or citrate"" by Traaten et.al states that metabolic acidosis occurs if a large citrate dose is not metabolized.


I can't wrap my head around why. Our citrate solution is a pure trisodium citrate + NaCl solution, thus it is somewhat basic, as should be expected with the salt of a weak acid. If it is partially metabolized, it shoud still not bring the pH down as the resultant citric acid would be balanced by bicarbonate.
The article points to the strong ion difference as an explanation, but I don't see how that would override the intrinsic basicity of the citrate salt.. Anyone with a good intuitive explanation out there?",14,18,2017-09-08,PHARMA,0.039364710450172424,0.9263685345649719,0.03426675498485565

medicine,Brookings: half of unemployed males on daily opioids,"Food for thought. I’m sympathetic to the argument that there’s a culture gap that widens distrust between providers and patients but damning data cannot be overlooked. I make it clear, there must be objective benefits to the pt’s life, otherwise opioids are dc’ed (responsibly). Not all disabled pts are going to get back to work of course (unfortunately since this is almost always making their pain worse), but there are other objective markers I use (happy to get into it if anybody asks). I feel bad for pts that answer my questions truthfully, they have absolutely no objective benefits from opioid therapy but expect another rx. 

I’ve had good luck lately explaining the theory behind low dose naltrexone (reduce the amount of opioid receptors that the body can use so endorphins production is increased, lowering pain and allowing other pain meds to work more effectively) and getting the proper pts to try this (failed opioids, candidate for either NSAIDs and/or ketamine for reduce pain relief...the reason LDN trials are going so slowly is high attrition rates since drs won’t give intranasal ketamine and opioids can’t bind to mu when taking LDN). Without the long talk explaining the pharmacology (including an explanation of the mu opioid receptors and what is different about LDN and other non-opioid pain meds) and answering all questions, the pt will not consider LDN. You’ll need an hour, unfortunately[1]. Admittedly it’s anecdotal, but I’ve seen pts lives objectively improve greatly—even CRPS pts—with LDN. I currently have fifteen pts on LDN. I usually give 500mg to 1g of ketamine n/s to each pt on LDN per month (along with a zofran ODT rx for ketamine N/V) along with clonidine, up to 1.3mg daily. 

[1] Honestly, I'm trying to do a pharmacology appt on the second visit with new pts now. It's hard. I'm trying to setup a program with our pharmacy to help me out with this (we already have them in outpatient clinic doing other things with the pts but it's part of an IRB). I have found such dramatic results when I explain the pharmacology. By results I don't just mean decreased pain scores but willingness to try other things besides opioids. Granted, we are a hybrid academic clinic serving wealthy pts in nyc primarily so I'm not sure how this will translate to other community clinics but I am so enamored with the results right now. I love it. Yesterday I had a pt initiate a conversation with me for 15 mins about TCAs, the pros and cons and we started them on it.

medicine,Why does ketamine get such a lukewarm reception?,"Whenever I mentioned this drug to attendings during my medical education, I would almost always get the same pat response: ""Well... (rolls eyes then looks at floor) I suppose it's OK for procedural sedation in children ... (trails off)""

Why is the US healthcare system so hostile to ketamine? In all honesty, I have seldom seen a drug with so much promising science behind it -- for both chronic pain and major depression -- get such a cold and reluctant reception from the medical establishment. Yes, I get that its reputation as a large animal tranquilizer slash rave drug do not help its image at all. Nor does its pharmacological connection to phencyclidine. But by and large, I think ketamine's lack of acceptance boils down to two factors. First, its short term psychoactive effects -- usually given the nebulous euphemism ""emergence phenomena"" in technical literature -- scare doctors, both medicolegally and ... dare I say it ... existentially. (More on that last part later.) Secondly, I think the quick, dramatic, and lasting results are a financial threat to the massive pain management and mental health industries, which, if I may be so bold, depend on people remaining in pain / depressed, and chronically in need of their pricey services.

Confession time. I have used ketamine intranasally, for recreational and entheogentic / spiritual purposes, long before I ever knew I would get into medicine. For obvious reasons, I've never been able to tell this to anyone I work with; I only feel safe disclosing it here because I have always taken great pains to hide my identity when using Reddit, and intend to always do so.

In any event, I count my handful of trips on sub-anesthetic ketamine among the most profound and positively life-changing experiences I've ever had. They were genuine mystical experiences, which to this day have caused me to reevaluate what is real, what is possible, and what my place in the grand scheme of things is. I can vouch firsthand for ketamine's ability to press the reset button on negative thought, behavioral, and perceptive habits, including learned helplessness and rumination on physical discomfort. Ketamine trips are not experiences that everyone could so easily integrate, and I would not wish them upon someone not ready for them. But ketamine is a powerful tool with much liberation to offer people stuck in a loop of self-defeating neuropsych patterns, and it's a shame that our profession by and large selects for too risk-averse a crowd to really explore or consider its possibilities.",174,135,2017-09-10,PHARMA,0.05667634308338165,0.9131733775138855,0.030150314792990685

A lot of times when I've brought this up to colleagues the response I get is that if we moved to single payer then salaries would go down. I understand that it is possible and we all work very hard to be in the positions we are and physicians earn every cent that they are paid(there are some exceptions of course) but surely there has to be some better way than what we have now.

I wanted to share some things I found interesting from the FDA. 2 out of the 380 drugs approved in August were ""new molecular entities"" meaning they were new and original drugs. This is horrendous considering Big Pharma's excuse for their prices is that they have to ""innovate"" so much. 

The ""me too"" drugs that make up so much of the market are bad for patients, right? If drug companies have been gradually spending less and less on innovation and more and more on marketing (check out Marcia Angell's book 'The Truth About Drug Companies' if you don't believe me) then isn't that lessening the quality of drugs while expanding the profit margins of drug companies?

Nursing student here. My mother is a recent, overly passionate convert to the world of essential oils, and I am a pretty big skeptic to the kinds of claims that she is parroting to me from what she's hearing from others in that world, but I'm really trying to research it all thoroughly and give it all a fair shake. 

She recently got back from a massive DoTerra annual conference, and talked all about how this company is ""working with the brightest doctors in the country"" and ""they have a partnership with Johns Hopkins and they are doing multiple research studies together"" etc. She even said that supposedly DoTerra are doing some oncology studies with Johns Hopkins, and how essential oils are going to be greatly integrated with western medicine and American hospitals in the next ten years.

I was at a loss for words (especially about the oncology claim), and pretty much the only substantive thing I could find online about these supposed claims is that DoTerra pushers are just [claiming it over and over again](https://www.facebook.com/essentialsymone/posts/1866672933556416:0) without Johns Hopkins knowledge or approval (couldn't find anything on their sites). I just can't believe that DoTerra would be so dumb as to make this JH claim at their annual conference without some kind of validity behind it, for risk of getting sued...but maybe I'm wrong.

medicine,The bed-pans blew-up all over her,"I see a lot of serious stuff here so I thought I would share a humorous story my mom once told me. 

Now, my mom became a nurse WAY back in 1949/1950, she trained and worked at Bellevue Hospital in NYC.  Mom becoming a nurse was a big deal, it was a point of pride for my immigrant grandparents and the talk of her Little Italy neighborhood. 

As the story goes, my grandparents had the mistaken impression that my mom  (who was barely past her first year of nursing at this point) was this big time nurse, had her own office, etc.  Mom, not wanting to try and explain what she actually did, just let it go and let her parents think whatever.  

So one afternoon my grandparents decided to go visit mom at the job, they got dressed up all nice to visit the big hospital and see their ""big time daughter who did important things""  As my grandparents are making their way to the hospital mom was given the quite unsavory task of collecting all the bed pans (some of which still had goo in them) and loading them into a bed pan autoclave.  Mom gets them all loaded up, turns the machine on and turns to some form she had to fill out while the autoclave is doing it's thing.  The elevator dings and the doors open and my grandparents emerge, with near perfect timing the poorly latched door of the autoclave gives way and blows open, tossing dirty bed pans and their contents all over my mother, the floor, the walls and my grandparents.  Grandma screams ""itsa poo, itsa poo"" in her thick Italian accent, grandpa laughs and mom is mortified as her boss and the other nurses come running to what mom described as a ""fecal crime scene.""  

Thankfully her coworkers were very nice people.  They cleaned up my grandparents and over my mom's objections (she wanted to clean it herself), maintenance cleaned up the ""crime scene.""  Mom finally had to come clean about not being some ""big time nurse"" and get into the nitty gritty of what she did.  My grandparents didn't care though, they were still proud their daughter was a nurse. 

tl/dr:  mom didn't latch the autoclave right, it blew bed pans and goo all over her, her parents and the hospital hallway.",46,273,2017-09-12,PHARMA,0.06223165988922119,0.9102538228034973,0.02751450054347515

medicine,"Help, my wife is wrapped up in naturopathy.","So, my wife has an ovarian cyst. She visited a normal practitioner and they advised that it was not large enough to warrant doing anything with it for the time being. They recommended taking a anti-depressant to help lower the pain from it. Her aunt and mother have both visited naturopaths, and she thought that she would as well. So long story short, they've done multiple blood tests, hormone, and food allergies. She is now convinced that she is ""allergic"" to half of all foods and is taking multiple supplements to adjust her hormones, bovine adrenal gland, was taking DHEA, among a myriad of other supplements. 

Well, we're visiting her mother, and like an idiot i explain how I have some concerns with naturopathy and their deceptive practices. They both were very quick to explain that modern medicine is an industry strictly ran by the big pharma, and naturopaths are the true healers. I understand that there are plenty deceptive practices in big pharma and a lot of doctors want to push a hundred medications on their patients. But, at the end of the day, fact is fact, and I really would rather have her not taken advantage of, mistreated and hurt. 

My wife went through college with some medical related classes, so i am obviously the fool, and just don't get it. And of course as soon as I display any dissent against naturopathy its a direct attack against her and her judgement.

Any recommendations on how I can help explain fact based science. She is an intelligent girl, it just blows my mind that I am typing this right now. I cannot believe that we've had this fight, over and over. But she absolutely fails to see that the majority of naturopathy is quackery. I understand that there is some of it that is logical, sensible, and effective. But as I've tried to explain time and time again, the large majority of it is SHIT.

Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. As much as I try to explain that i care about her and her health, she takes it as a direct attack against her intelligence and judgement. Am I insane to be so adamant against naturopathy? I only am because I truly do care deeply for her.

The specific diseases he mentioned were chronic lyme disease, fibromyalgia, POTS disease, and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (we had a guy at our hospital diagnose everyone with this and start them on anti-histamine drips, sometimes even from an infusion pump). The attending told me everyone he had seen with these disorders met criteria for a psychosomatic disorder (and usually had a significant psych history) and that most of them had been to at least a dozen doctors before one diagnosed them with one of these more medical sounding diseases. Many of them are then prescribed non-sensical, expensive treatments and end up spending thousands and thousands of dollars on extensive workups and lifelong treatments. 

Being in a lyme-endemic area and having heard about chronic lyme (note: I don't mean post-treatment lyme) a lot I looked up the diagnostic criteria and was pretty surprised. Essentially all that is needed is a positive lyme serology (IgG) and basically any symptom (fatigue, joint pain, abdominal pain, etc). I'd be willing to bet most people in my area have exposure to lyme and feels tired every once in a while. I brought this up on a few other rotations and the neuro and ED teams I worked with saw a lot of these patients and were convinced they were generally psychosomatic, but other teams were not so sure.

It's a classic story that someone being diagnosed with a psychosomatic disease will get offended at being told ""it's all in their head"" and will go see a different doctor, but I was surprised at him saying essentially every patient with the above diseases just had a psychosomatic disorder and was being led-on by a physician that was at best practicing shoddy EBM or at worst milking their patients for money with a made-up disease. I don't mean to call these physicians quacks or anything, but it seems like they are taking advantage of these vulnerable patients by telling them they have a medical disease whose existence is often debated, it's not in their head, and then prescribing a bunch of treatments insurance won't cover. 

Just wondering if anyone here can shed light onto the validity of these diseases, or if there are any other diseases out there you see a lot that seem to be mostly psychosomatic.",362,238,2017-09-14,PHARMA,0.144090473651886,0.8335943818092346,0.0223151296377182

She states that she cannot find a breakdown of the acronym anywhere in the patient's paperwork.  I have no idea about anything else in the patient's history other than these isolation precautions. 

I searched CDC and NIH with no dice. When I google it, I just keep getting lead back to the European Society of Veterinary Ophthalmology and an outdoor supply company, so no go on those either.  

Any clue of what this infection is?  Is it something common that we are used to hearing by another name?

Went a bunch of times over two, two and a half weeks, as the back pain was getting worse, and he was starting to have a bit of trouble feeling his feet.... Chiropractor kept telling him reassuring things, don't worry, I can fix this. So he didn't go to an MD.

Finally, it developed to the point where my pt wasn't able to walk without assistance, so he got himself taken to the ED.  MRI showed giant extradural mass with major cord compression. Dude is now like two weeks post debulking, and while he's got no compression left on imaging, he's weak as a kitten in both legs from the axonal insult. May or may not recover all function. 

Oh, and post debulking: small blue cell tumor, of course.

medicine,Difference in ICU cultures in different countries,"I came across a statistic today that said 1 in 5 Americans die in ICU. I was absolutely amazed reading that. I'm an Anaesthetics Trainee in the UK/Ireland and to me that just seems unbelievable. I have read accounts about patients in the US who end up in ICU and all I can think is that our intensivist consultants would not let them anywhere near the unit. They would say that things are clearly futile, ICU level care will only prolong suffering and that it would be cruel to admit them/intubate/dialyse/art line/central line etc. and I can't think of an occasion where I've disagreed with the ICU consultant's decision. I know I wouldn't want me or my family to go to ICU for anything not fairly quickly and successfully reversible.

How does the ICU culture/approach differ in the US? Are the ICU attendings less willing to 'give up' on patients? Do families have more say on whether their relative gets admitted or not? On the point of families, I have found here that by giving them realistic information about prognosis and outcomes, and the potential harms of ICU level care  that very very few disagree with the ICU team's decisions. Are the patient's referring teams granted automatic access to ICU beds? On the other hand do any US guys think that we have it wrong over here and that we're doing patients a disservice by not giving them a chance at intensive care? What about people from other countries, how is ICU admission treated with you guys?

pharmacy,I regret leaving pharmacy school,"I always wondered if this day would come.  Deep down, I knew that a tiny part of me would always doubt the decision to leave but I never knew if it would turn into full-fledged regret.  Please, if you are in your first year of pharmacy school and reconsidering your career, take this as a warning from someone on the other side.


The previous four years, I had put my full heart into a chemistry bachelors at a top 20 university and also juggled working, internships, and applying/interviewing at multiple pharmacy schools.  The culture amongst my peers was treating school like a race to the finish line-- there was tremendous pressure and expectation to fly through your entire education process.  In retrospect, I should have taken a year or two off after undergrad to work and catch my breath.  Instead, the thrill of being accepted to three out of four of the schools I applied to sent me on a magic carpet ride to disaster.


It was so hard connecting with people in my new class.  I had ended an emotionally abusive relationship before moving back to the metropolitan area I grew up in to attend my top pick program and became HIGHLY introverted.  Being around other students exhausted me.  There were several days that I just stayed under the bedcovers and literally hid from the world.  Midterms came and went, I averaged B's and C's on each exam.


When filling out an intake form to see a school mental health counselor, there was a section that asked ""Are you considering any of the following?  Dropping a class, taking a leave of absence, leaving the program""  That's when the seed was planted.  I had never thought of just getting up and leaving until that point.


A few weeks pass with twice-a-week counseling but things aren't improving.  The suicidal thoughts are intensifying and I well up with tears almost daily, often on campus.  Every day felt like a haze of depression and anxiety.  I woke up one day and just said No More.  Filed for a year long leave of absence, took the train home, and drank a bottle of cheap champagne.


That was almost three years ago.  I have a decent benchtop job at a major pharmaceutical company but I'm having a hell of a time advancing with ""just a bachelors"".  I earn $30/hr, which in the Bay Area is basically bare minimum for a semi-stable life.  


As I get older, I'm beginning to see opportunities I once had just simply fading away.  No matter where I go to school next, I will always have to explain why I left pharmacy school after only a few months.  I will never be able to afford a home close to where my parents live and enjoy our last few decades together.  I don't even think I can afford to have kids before my biological clock runs out.


A few months ago I was reading someone's assessment of what adjusting to med school is like:  ""You are having someone body-check you to the ground over and over for the first three to four months.""  Maybe if I had just stuck it through that first period of adjustment I'd be on my way to a doctorate degree in a field I love.  Instead, I'm a glorified lab tech who can't even afford to have a cat keep me company in this crummy studio apartment.

Also, if I'm looking for a patient I saw and open another patient's chart by accident is that a violation?

medicine,Today I had my first really emotional reaction to a patient's case.,"I work in a small ED that transfers out pretty much everything interesting. Neuro, transfer. Peds, transfer. High acuity, transfer. So it goes without saying that I generally don't get the chance to react emotionally to a patient's condition or decisions because their complaint is usually minor and the plan of care is straightforward.

But tonight EMS brought in a 19 y.o. heroin overdose reversed by Narcan. She was alert and crying upon arrival, obviously didn't want to be here at all. We were about to do a sono for EJ IV access. She asks if it's completely necessary to start an IV. Doctor says yes, unless you want to leave and be back here in 30 minutes when the Narcan wears off before the heroin. She refuses any more intervention because she's scared of the needle and wants to go home. Nevermind she's been using needles herself for 6 years, nevermind she's already been resuscitated once tonight, nevermind that all other points of access are off the table at this point. 

Doctor convinces her to stay but she is adamantly no-needles-in-my-neck-anymore-tonight. I don't know what it is about this particular patient but I feel angry and sad and I don't know what to do with those emotions. She's almost my age. We kind of look alike. She's making terrible decisions and it's like I'm watching myself make those decisions.

medicine,Sticking it out through residency - one perspective,"Per my flair, I’m a Urology resident in my third year. I’m coming to the end of a stretch of 12 days on call straight at one of the smaller hospitals in our training program. I am it for the Urology residents in the hospital - I’ve been managing the inpatients, consults, doing all the cases, and taking care of resident responsibilities on my own when there are usually two of us (a 3 and a 6). I have some thoughts -


**This was hard**

Being on call straight for many days is a reality for many attending positions after residency. Day and night the pager is hooked to your hip and your life revolves around it. I don’t think my cortisol levels have been this high ever. I’m fairly certain I am diabetic and that I’ve gained a a decent amount of weight over the course of this week. It gave me a better appreciation of how poorly prepared I feel to handle this level of responsibility and makes me grateful that I have 3+ more years of training to better myself. I can’t wait for q2 call to have some intervening nights off. 


**Inpatient care is challenging**

Yes, I have attendings that supervise me. Yes, I have other specialties and consult services available to me in the hospital. But despite having managed post-ops *with the assistance of senior residents*, doing it on my own is hard. Never have I appreciated the quick ‘hey I did this and that and this was the result’ with my chief resident and getting a quick nod of approval. There is some security to having a higher level resident sign off on what you do. Bumping it up has been my mantra through residency and finding ways to do that when you’re alone with your attendings is challenging. I now recognize the difficulty my chief resident was going through when her post-op was floundering and we all couldn’t figure out why despite consulting damn near everyone. **This is hard.** These are human lives I am responsible for *12 days in a row*. 


Some of you are hospitalists and spend weeks at a time caring for the same people. The agony of rocks and those who don’t improve must be extremely frustrating. This is a side of medicine I hadn’t yet had to experience. Every 4 weeks you just rotate off and it’s the next teams problem. But when it’s just you, it consumes you. 


So with all this in mind - I understand now why I’m here for another 3+ years. I won’t complain the next time I’m on for a weekend, because it’s better than this. I won’t gripe about all the extra work I do to just spend some time in the OR. This is a privilege that is challenging and comes with a huge responsibility.

pharmacy,"Some excerpts from my controversial paper ""How the Business of Higher Education is Destroying the Pharmacy Profession""","If anyone is interested in citations, let me know! I wrote this last year, was not well received :)

- Pharmacy Manpower sponsored a conference of pharmacy experts in 2001 where it was estimated there would be a need for 417,000 full-time equivalents by 2020. When calculating the 157,000 full-time equivalent deficit expected in 2020, they assumed that only 3 new pharmacy programs would be added every 10 years.

- Back in 2000, there were only 82 pharmacy programs. By 2014, this number increased to 130, a 59% increase. Compare this increase to the mere 12% increase in law schools over this same time period.

- Program expansion is responsible for 32% of the 70% increase in the number of Pharm.D. graduates from 2001 to 2011. There are 31 programs that have increased their class size by more than 50% since 2001.

- The Pharmacy Workforce Center tracks pharmacist demand by compiling the aggregate demand index (ADI). The ADI is comes from a panel of pharmacist hirers based on their impressions of the job market. Panel members report a score monthly on a 5 point scale, where 5 = high demand, 4 = moderate demand, 3 = demand in balance with supply, 2 = demand is less than the supply, and 1 = demand is much less than the supply.

- There were many opportunities for new graduates from 2002 to early 2008 when the ADI remained steady at a 4. From 2008 to 2010, the ADI began a downward trend toward the equilibrium point of 3. In places like the Northeast where there has been major academic growth, the ADI dropped to a 2.85. The most recent ADI reported was 3.05 for January 2016, down from 3.51 the year prior. The ADI in the New England region was at a record low of 2.17 as of January 2016.

- Based on research done by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, the 50th percentile pharmacy school delivers 31% earnings before income tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). This is post-operations earnings. Walgreens, one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the world, had $72 billion in revenue in 2013 with 5.4% EBITDA.

- A survey conducted in 2012 found that 88.7% of pharmacy graduates had taken out student loans at an average of $123,000. The amount of money pharmacy students have borrowed has risen the fastest in the last 5 years at 23% when compared to medical students at 4.7% and dental students at 8.5%. There has been a 54% increase in average tuition cost in the past 8 years.

- It can be hard to imagine an institution of higher education exploiting the profession to make money.

medicine,How much CSF is it safe to remove from a child?,"After performing yet another lumbar puncture today as part of a septic screen, it got me wondering just how much CSF can be safely removed during a lumbar puncture of a child.

I've found figures online suggesting an infant has about 50ml of CSF, and CSF is produced at a rate of around 0.35ml per minute. I also found figures suggesting a single drop of CSF is 0.06ml. This suggests that taking the usual 20 or so drops of CSF can be replaced in less than 5 minutes. So presumably the only danger is removing a significant volume such that there is significant pressure changes in the CNS. 

 Is the only way to measure this by stopping at the lower end of the normal range of CSF pressure? Or is there a published figure somewhere suggesting maximum safe amounts of CSF that can be removed per kg weight? 

I haven't managed to find much on pubmed which can directly or indirectly answer this question, so I'd appreciate any ideas or suggestions to satisfy my curiosity.",23,27,2017-09-24,PHARMA,0.051359329372644424,0.9181458353996277,0.030494878068566322

medicine,From a nurse: Thank you for all that you do,"I had a pretty horrific shift in the ER a couple of nights ago that made me question continuing my career as a nurse. A 3 year old girl had been transported from a rural hospital to our facility after her father had beaten her so badly she lost consciousness. Every inch of this child's body was covered in bruises and lacerations from the knife she was cut with. Her limbs, her back, abdomen, and worst of all, her head. She had finger shaped bruises around her neck, and two black eyes. I'm only a very young, very new RN (and admittedly, one with a bleeding heart) that doesn't have much experience in pediatrics so I'm still very much struggling with what I saw.

Regardless of the awful circumstances under which this girl came to us, from the moment she arrived to when she was transported up to the paediatric ward, the ER, Peds, Ortho, and Neuro doctors were brilliant. I saw nothing but respect, sensitivity, and high quality care towards this patient and her mother and for that I want to say thank you.

medicine,Are CPR chest compressions ever contraindicated in a first-response situation for someone with an irregular pulse?,"BSN nursing student here. Today myself and a nearby Medical Assistant (MA) previously unknown to me were the first responders to a mid-50s woman who had a seizure, hit her head on a horizontal pole on her way to the ground, and then hit the pavement at a bus stop. A bystander said he had previously been talking to her and she was A&amp;Ox4, but when we tried to speak with her moments after the incident and for the remainder of the time I was with her, she was A&amp;Ox0 or 1 at best. 

When I arrived, the MA was starting compressions (he got about 30 in, no rescue breaths), meanwhile I checked for a pulse (bradycardic, irregular), I checked her pallor (non-cyanotic ~ 90 secs after incident), I observed her breathing (present but very irregular, almost like agonal breathing) and that she was beginning to vomit a significant amount of fluids so I suggested we carefully roll her whole body to her side with knees bent at 90 degrees for stability of the position and then support her neck and maintain the position thereafter, which we did. This rolling to the side seemed a priority to me over that of completely immobilizing C-spine, as she seemed to be at imminent risk of aspirating her vomit and saliva, however I could understand a counter-rationale and am interested in what you all have to say on this choice of mine as well. I noticed the woman had a medical visit summary of a very recent visit 2 hours prior to my Level 1 Trauma hospital that I work / go to school at sticking very visibly out of her purse, so I grabbed it and noted she had no obvious other relevant medical history listed, other than that she was on phenytoin so she had a history of seizures. We were reporting all of this to the 911 dispatcher on speakerphone simultaneously until paramedics arrived.

All this context to say that I have a question that I feel was never or never adequately covered in previous CPR / AED / BLS courses I've taken, which is...are chest compressions ever contraindicated in someone like this with an irregular heartbeat? We had called for an AED -- paramedics showed up first -- and I recognize that there are shockable versus non-shockable rhythms, but when you don't have an AED to advise you on what to do in a situation like this, and the patient is barely conscious but technically ""arousable"" (responsive to first name only) and has irregular but seemingly somewhat present breathing patterns, can you use pulse status as an indicator for whether to give compressions? It seems like unnecessary compressions could make a bad situation worse, and my gut today suggested that if I could feel a decent, but bradycardic irregular radial pulse, that that was sufficient to switch my priority to ensuring a clear airway. Was I wrong? Any other suggestions on what I or the MA might have done better today?

medicine,NSAIDs after bariatric surgery?,"Hello r/medicine, I wanted to pick the brain of our mixed community here!

I had a patent in the ER recently who was a 45-year-old woman, 18 months out from a sleeve gastrectomy and 6 months out from a partial omentectomy from a local bariatric surgeon (he's well-renowned, but at another hospital, I did not have her records, so I took her word for it). So naturally, I gave her IV opioids whilst ordering blood work, urine testing, and a CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast. She had a localized area of stranding superficial to her omentectomy site, likely due to localized fat necrosis, per her CT scan. I talked with the radiologist on the phone, I consulted our general surgeon who personally evaluated the patient, and that was what we came up with.

She recommended pain control at home with PO opioids and NSAIDs. I asked her about using NSAIDs after bariatric surgery, as I understand gastritis and ulcers would be detrimental to those patients' staple lines. We decided a short course would benefit her more than harm her. The patient was hesitant about this plan, as she was told never to take NSAIDs by her bariatric surgeon.

Can we give these patients even short courses of NSAIDs? Or am I dooming her to leaks and revisions? And, if so, which NSAIDs? Celebrex? Mobic? Add on some carafate?",14,32,2017-09-27,PHARMA,0.10052202641963959,0.8756506443023682,0.023827360942959785

He was still alert and oriented but he says he doesn't want intubation, knowing that he could die without it. The reason he gave was that he just doesn't want a tube down his throat. 

What's the most appropriate way to proceed: Abide by his wishes and let him die (as unreasonable as it may seem), or intubate him (assuming he's not in his right mind)? 

**edit** Nice to see all the discussion here! So the patient did get tubed. When he woke up and extubated he didn't seem to remember saying that he wanted to be DNR; so that was that, no psych consult needed.

[Southern California medical school and teaching hospital caught up in a massive scandal](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20824193/ncaa-basketball-coaches-10-charged-fraud-corruption).   

Residency directors were arrested by the FBI for bribery and wire fraud related to bringing in the ""most sought after"" medical students and residents, and attempting to offer kickbacks to several major medical supply companies for their endorsements.  Incoming residents were offered tens of thousands of dollars to secure their Letter of Intent to the institution.  A school official was quoted as saying ""We were just about to land some really huge endorsements of 'blue chip' students and first-year residents"".

There are 126 of them, each constructed of stainless steel, adorned with milky white doors and Bevo insignias. A 43-inch television hangs atop every newly installed locker like a hi-tech crown. On Aug. 2, the Residency Director finally welcomed his new residents to the swanky new digs. Residents flooded through the entrance and gasped. Or roared. Or stared in stunned silence. The chief of Medicine was quoted as saying ""It’s about luring the best students and residents in the nation to Austin. It’s about wowing colleges. It’s about winning the arms race.""

medicine,Do you find medicine isolating?,"The usual debate over universal healthcare has reared its head again over in /r/askreddit, and among the comments was a fellow's post made under a throwaway. Maybe you saw it? What he gets at - or, at least, what I understood - is that he would like to be paid a lot for his services, though he feels conflicted over it. As you'd expect, some people support him while others violently don't.

What stood out to me was that he felt guilty enough to use a throwaway account. He didn't want people in his real life to know how he felt. Maybe a slightly odd move to some - but I instinctively recognized why he'd done it, and I'm sure many of you do too. 

It also occurred to me that this was a somewhat lonely thing to do.

I've found that medicine can have that effect, though. It's a specialized world with it's own language (and lots of *very* different dialects), culture, etc. It takes a vast commitment of time and finances that are paid some lip service, but which are generally not well understood (in my experience, anyway) . You occasionally see and/or do extreme things which are nearly impossible to relate to someone who hasn't been there and done that. Large portions of the general public expect us, as providers, to act as scientist-saints - which is both ludicrous and frighteningly complimentary. 

Given all of the above (and speaking only for myself, of course), I don't have many friends that aren't doctors. I treasure the ones I do have, but I also knew them for years prior to med school. Since setting foot in this world (and it really does feel like that sometimes), I've made a few new pals among the people I trained with. Mostly, I've met a lot of nice people at hospital - but as far as I know, the main thing we have in common is medicine. 

I don't say all of this to complain. I certainly don't regret my choices; I love what I do. A bit of isolation is far from the worst thing that has ever happened to anybody - but it's also not meaningless. I think my experience is fairly common, and I haven't heard it discussed very often or in depth.

So that's my question, I guess. Do you feel as if medicine has had an isolating effect on your life? And if so, does that bother you? What do you do about it?

medicine,Ignorant question about transplants and surgery in general,"I work at a major hospital that does a substantial number of transplants and high risk surgeries. Sometimes, inevitably, surgeries (especially liver transplants, oh my God) turn into blood-spewing horrorshows (I'm assuming this based on how many units get transfused). I guess my question is, what's going on in there? From my perspective it's kind of a black box where blood disappears.

I know livers are hard because of the associated coag factor deficiencies, as well as just how much blood goes through a liver. I've seen a double lung go bad as well. So, why do they go bad? Obviously there isn't just one answer, but it is more often something like someone nicked or lost control of a major vessel? Widespread brisk oozing that won't clot from places you can't clamp off? Adhesions making it impossible to pry parts off of other parts without vascular damage?

I'm sorry if this is a ridiculous question, I'm just really curious and obviously the surgeons are way too busy to ever ask. Y'all do amazing and lifesaving work, and I'm genuinely proud that I get to help make it happen.

Edit: the big takeaway question is, what differentiates a bloodbath from a messy but manageable surgery?",51,180,2017-09-30,PHARMA,0.06568703055381775,0.9054630398750305,0.028849942609667778
medicine,Leveraging a spirituality you don't believe in,"I had a pretty good patient encounter today with a patient I deeply respect. He's a pastor, and he's been through some pretty incredibly unreasonable stuff lately. He's the sort to repress a bit, and we started talking about Job and some of the lessons from that part of the Bible (specifically that Job didn't take his lot lying down, and spoke to God about the unfairness of it all). The conversation was a hit, and got us into a pretty reasonable discussion about his suffering, the likely oncoming end of his life, and that kind of thing. He commented on me being Christian and I had to be honest with him: I'm not, I'm atheist.

In this case we had a good talk about it anyway. Although I'm atheist, I know the Bible fairly well, because while it might not be my spirituality, it's extremely important to a lot of my patients (like this one). I think as their doctor it's not about my own beliefs, just like it's not about my personal struggle or illnesses or whatnot.

I'm curious. What are your opinions on discussing spirituality with patients who don't share yours? Is an atheist doctor discussing biblical lessons with a Christian patient weird? Do docs with another belief system set aside their own structures to have conversations with patients in their own context?",24,86,2017-09-30,PHARMA,0.062094543129205704,0.9083691239356995,0.02953639067709446
