medicine,[AMA Request] Dr. Ben Carson,"**My 5 Questions:**

1. Of the thousands of surgeries you have performed, which was the most challenging? 
2. Has being a ""patient"" yourself (cancer survivor) changed the way you think about medicine?
3. Who were you medical mentors/heros?
4. You have made various claims as to how damaging the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will be/has been. Could you please explain why you believe this to be true? 
5. Over the last few years you have become more outspoken on your political views. Are politics your primary point of focus now?

medicine,Is my uncle just insane or is this a thing amongst surgeons?,"There I was visiting my family in Texas. My Uncle, who is a trauma surgeon, is preparing the meat for the barbecue. Out of his truck he takes all kids of meat and one of those full pigs wrapped in this white plastic. He tells me to close the bed of the truck, and I as do so, I see there is another full pig inside. I turn to him and go; ""Uncle Joe, you forgot the second pig!"" and he goes ""Nah, kid. That is for later."" I shrug it off and help him move the meat and booze to the tables. A few hours later, after a few of the guests have arrived, I see him, 2 of his colleagues from the hospital, my (other) uncle and cousin who are Marine field corpsman. I over hear them chit chatting about some other dude who has not arrived yet. I go up to them and ask what the fuck is going on. They go ""This new guy is starting at the hospital next week."" I ask what the fuck is that suppose to mean. They tell me to go away because the guy has arrived. 

I see the new guy come out of his car, kinda frightened, and walk up to them. Nice looking fellow, maybe 30, 32. He shakes all of their hands and they start to walk towards my uncle's truck. They take the pig out of the back, hang it on a chain the the middle of the field and proceed to shoot it with an AR-15 and various pistols. Then they lay it on the ground and run over it. Twice. 

They new guy is just sitting in the corner, drinking a beer nervously. The pig is now on top of a table. They bring the poor fella up to the dead, shot up and ran over corpse, put a kit bag on his hand and say ""Save this dead pig."" The guy the spends the next 2 hours cutting, pulling, sticking and whatever the fuck you do to ""save"" a dead animal. After he is done, my uncles, his doctor buddies and my cousin spend another 20 minutes dissecting the pig. Finally they finish, clean their hands on a bucket, turn to him with a big ass whiskey bottle and scream ""Welcome to the team, Steave!"" Apparently, you cant operate with those guys if you don't go through the initiation ritual...

I know a lot can change in the next couple of years and I still have A LOT to learn in terms of different medical careers but I am considering pursuing career in a surgical specialty.

Unfortunately, the lifestyle of a surgeon is infamous and I have often heard it said that you should not pursue a career in surgery unless you absolutely cannot find anything else you might enjoy. But I am absolutely fascinated by surgery and I would hate to give up on my dream just because I was uninformed and afraid of what my future lifestyle might be like.

So surgeons of reddit, do you really work 80+ hours per week? Are you under constant stress? Do you regret pursuing a career in surgery?

From what I understand, the NHSC will pay for a relatively significant amount of your professional schooling in exchange for 2 years dedicated to an underserved community after graduation. For those who have served:

1) did you regret your involvement for any reason?

2) what did you enjoy most about your commitment?

3) would you do it again/would you recommend this program?

medicine,First time in over 25 years of practice that I brought home gastro to my family. Probably Novovirus.,"Saw a patient 4 nights ago with bad gastro.  Thought I was careful about precautions.  36 hours later it started.  Waves of vomiting and diarrhea every 30 to 40 minutes.  Felt like I was being water-boarded.  (Ok I'm a pussy.)  Fatigue, barely able to walk.  I felt it was a great accomplishment to have a shower two days later.

Now I'm kind of better, but lost 5 pounds, and have no appetite.
Woke up to find out my wife and adult son are also vomiting.  I was sleeping in another room to try and minimize contagion.

Nothing makes you appreciate the suffering of your patients like suffering.

As I was in the throes of it, I kept thinking of what my 1st year pathology professor with a British accent said in 1980 about staphylococcal food poisoning (which has a similar clinical presentation).

medicine,"New doctors of reddit: following completion of residency, what is it like trying to find a job?","I am a 2nd year US medical student looking forward to a summer-time date with Step 1, immediately followed by my wedding day. My fiance' understands that I'll be putting in enough time during the 5 weeks leading up to the exam to be a stranger by the time she walks down that aisle, but she wants to know that there will be a light at the end of this wacky, winding tunnel of medicine. She struggled to find a job after college (with an impressive resume) and knows first-hand that a college diploma is not an automatic employment ticket, so she wants to know if my 200k diploma will be any different. I honestly don't know what to tell her.

I'm interested in working in a private or group setting in either internal medicine or pediatrics. All of the physicians that I trust for career advice are either academic physicians or much older and distantly removed from job hunting, and thus don't have answers for my questions. Hopefully this post can reach newly graduated residents or fellows who have time to share a quick experience or two.

Health,My baby brother (who's 30) is dying and doesn't seem to care. I'm struggling to deal.,"Basically, he has a factor 5 clotting disorder which means his blood clots about 10 times more than most folks. So if he gets a bruise, it just turns into a big old clot. He also has poor blood return from his legs to his heart due to a twisted vein/artery situation in his chest. He has wounds in both legs, they vary in healing, sometimes down to the bone, sometimes just black looking.

His doctors originally told him when things first started to get bad that there was no way he'd keep his legs to the age of 30 and if they couldn't control things better, he'd not see 30 at all. He turned 30 last month.  12 years ago he spent nearly a year in hospital. Died on the operating table twice while they were trying to install stints and put a filter over his lungs. He blew clots both times that they managed to save.  He went through over a dozen surgeries to try and save his life and his legs.

He's been in and out of the hospital for the last few months with new clots and other complications, but he doesn't seem to care.  He's seriously overweight, his legs and feet look awful and he's in constant pain. This weekend he ended up back at the ER and now has a large clot in his hip and upper thigh too. The larger of the two is about the size of a golf ball. 

He's on blood thinners, so many blood thinners that surgery at this point is out of the question. If he gets a cut he has to go get stitches, if he were in a car accident he'd be dead. I'm so scared of losing him, but since he hit that magic 30 both with his legs and alive, it's like he's given up. 

Do I just let him give up? I've tried to let him know I'd be there, for anything he needed, help him anyway I could, but he won't let anyone help him. I don't want to lose my baby brother.",42,77,2014-02-10,PHARMA,0.28098157048225403,0.694434404373169,0.024584010243415833

If anything were possible, what would you like to see developed to help you in your work?","As brief background, we are a team with backgrounds in healthcare, user experience design, computer science, and business. 

We all come from personal experience in health-related work, ranging from electronic health records, patient-focused software for managing chronic diseases, emergency services, nurse education, and so forth. We  have access to Google Glass through the Explorer program, and see many potential concepts for applications that could be built to quickly and meaningfully be of help to medical professionals. 

We have had wonderful conversations through our own networks, and are ramping up research with an eye to prototyping and co-designing apps for release this year. THAT SAID, we take product development seriously and recognize the importance of rigorously understanding user needs and priorities, in order to create an application of value. 

You are a vibrant community and I would like to hear—straight from the source, on r/medicine—what you would like to see developed as an app for Glass. If we could design something specifically for you, what would you ask for?

Thank you in advance for your insight. We are in the NY area, for anyone who might like to play with Glass or speak with us further. Please also feel free to PM me. 

Very best, and I am so excited for your thoughts! 

edit: WOW! A tremendous thank you to everyone for your sharing your thoughts and ideas. This has been absolutely wonderful in helping us to concept. I'll be responding to PMs shortly.

medicine,D.O.'s of Reddit - do you feel your degree has hindered your career in any way?,"Whether through prejudice against D.O.'s by doctors or patients, being kept out of your chosen field in residency matching, or through other factors, has being a D.O. had any negative impact on your career?

The response I've heard from other D.O.'s has been ""not really."" I'll likely be choosing between an M.D. and D.O. school in the next few months that both have very strong points (the M.D. school has a newer and more exciting/interesting curriculum; the D.O. school is much older/more established with more alumni and name recognition, has a center dedicated to my likely specialty and is in a better location). I'm leaning slightly toward the D.O. school at this point, so I'd really appreciate the opportunity to hear from people who have relevant experience, but have no personal stake in my decision. (I haven't heard back from the M.D. school yet, but based on how the interview went I feel fairly confident. It's possible I won't have to make this decision at all.)

I just want to add that my interest right now is in hospice and palliative medicine (or possibly geriatrics). As I understand it, this would entail a residency in internal medicine before a fellowship, and would not necessarily put me at a disadvantage when matching to a residency if I go to the D.O. school.

They will want to know specifics.  

Always remember, the [Medical disclaimer of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement?v=ac5e74ee-b28c-11e2-8119-12313b0d4e76#section_medical_information_disclaimer).

medicine,American College of Radiology says BMJ Article on Breast Cancer Screening Effectiveness Incredibly Flawed and Misleading,"BMJ Article on Breast Cancer Screening Effectiveness Incredibly Flawed and Misleading February 12, 2014 

According to the American College of Radiology and Society of Breast Imaging, the recent breast cancer screening article (Miller et al) published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) (1) is an incredibly misleading analysis based on the deeply flawed and widely discredited Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS). The results of this BMJ study, and others resulting from the CNBSS trial, should not be used to create breast cancer screening policy as this would place a great many women at increased risk of dying unnecessarily from breast cancer.

Experts called on to review the CNBSS confirmed that the mammography quality was poor (2). The trial used second hand mammography machines, which were not state of the art at the time of the trial. The images were compromised by “scatter,” which makes the images cloudy and cancers harder to see since they did not employ grids for much of the trial. Grids remove the scatter and make it easier to see cancers. Also, technologists were not taught proper positioning. As such, many women were not properly positioned in the machines, resulting in missed cancers. And the CNBSS radiologists had no specific training in mammographic interpretation. The CNBSS own reference physicist stated that ""...in my work as reference physicist to the NBSS, [I] identified many concerns regarding the quality of mammography carried out in some of the NBSS screening centers. That quality [in the NBSS] was far below state of the art, even for that time (early 1980s).""(3)
In this latest BMJ paper, only 32 percent of cancers were detected by mammography alone. This extremely low number is consistent with poor quality mammography. At least two-thirds of the cancers should be detected by mammography alone (4). In an accompanying BMJ editorial, Kalager and Adami admit that ""The lack of mortality benefit is also biologically plausible because the mean tumour size was 19mm in the screening group and 21mm in the control group... a 2mm difference."" The documented poor quality of the NBSS mammography screening alone explains these results and should disqualify the CNBSS as a valid scientific study of modern mammography screening. Yet, the CNBSS trial was even more troubled (5).

To be valid, randomized, controlled trials (RCT) must employ a system to ensure that the assignment of women to the screening group or the unscreened control group is random. Nothing can/should be known about participants until they have been assigned to one of these groups. The CNBSS violated these fundamental rules (6). Every woman first had a clinical breast examination by a trained nurse so that they knew which women had breast lumps, many of which were cancers, and which women had large lymph nodes in their armpits many of which indicated advanced cancer. Before assigning the women to be in the group offered screening or the control women, investigators knew who had large incurable cancers. This was a major violation of RCT protocol. It most likely resulted in the statistically significant excess of women with advanced breast cancers assigned to the screening arm compared to those assigned to the control arm (7). This guaranteed more deaths among the screened women than the control women.

The five year survival from breast cancer among women ages 40–49 in Canada in the 1980s was only 75 percent, yet the control women in the CNBSS, who were supposed to reflect the Canadian population at the time, had a greater than 90 percent five year survival (8). This indicates that cancers may have been shifted from the control arm to the screening arm. Coupling the fundamentally corrupted allocation process with the documented poor quality of the mammography should have long ago disqualified the CNBSS as a legitimate trial of modern screening mammography.

pharmacy,Prescription Quantity Error,"Hi r/pharmacy - Hopefully you can provide a patient with some advice, as I am not sure how to proceed.

Just some background. I suffer from narcolepsy and have been scripted 180 dextroamphetamine a month for the last eight years. It allows me to function and maintain a job, life etc. without falling asleep. I have never finished my medication early and have always followed my doctors prescribing instructions.

On the 8th of Feb I went to fill my monthly Rx at a chain pharmacy. My doctor had written the #180 to dispense and in words written dispense ""one hundred twenty"". It was a mistake I should have caught as well as the doctor, but an honest mistake. The pharmacy informed me of the discrepancy and told me they could fill it if they contact the doctor and the doctor agrees to send a new corrected prescription. The doctor called them right back and apologized for the error and said they would send a new Rx. So the pharmacy filled the Rx. The bottle said 180 quantity so I figured all was good.

Now a week later, I am looking at the amount I have left, and based on my dosing schedule it appears they may have only filled the Rx for 120 which was written out, not the 180. Like I said I stick to my dosing schedule religiously and have for years. I can't function in a job, or even drive a car, without medication. So obviously it is really important to me not to go over or to abuse my medication or anything like that.

The fact that this is a CII medication makes it a little more complicated. I have never had anything like this happen to me. I have always received the number prescribed, but I have also never had a mistake on a prescription before.

Was it possible that the pharmacy only filled for the 120 and I was supposed to pick up the other 60 once the corrected Rx was received? This wasn't explained to me and I'm not sure about the laws. Or could it have just been an honest mistake? I should have counted to be sure when I picked up the Rx, but regretfully I didn't.

Anyway, this is in the state of CT if that matters in terms of law. I'm not looking to get anyone in trouble or anything like that. I realize errors occur and pharmacists have to deal with lots of Dr. errors etc. However it is really going to play havoc with my ability to function at work and really in life. 

I thought about the fact that maybe someone was swiping them from me, but I keep them locked up, or on me at all times. And this hasn't happened in the eight years, so I am fairly sure this isn't the issue.

What would you recommend r/pharmacy? Am I just stuck until the next 30 day cycle? Is it too late to go back and question the pharmacy to see if a mistake was made? Sorry if all of this is silly. I have never had this issue before. If I have to be without meds for awhile I will need to take vacation from work.

Thanks much for any advice you can provide! Sorry this is such a complicated situation.

Edit: Thanks to all of you for your suggestions. I guess I will need to head back to the pharmacy and speak with them. I just find it nerve racking because it's a CII and there is always so much scrutiny involved. I don't want to be placed on a list or anything :/. Hopefully it was just an honest mistake and like I said I don't want anyone to get in trouble over it. I just want to make sure I have my medication to last through the month. Especially since I paid for the full amount :) Thanks again for your assistance and all you do to assist patients!

medicine,Young girl comes into ED with intriguing story. Questions about interesting diagnosis. Story inside.,"Hey /r/medicine, 

ER nurse here. The other day I was triaging at our ambulatory entrance. For reference, I'll explain the way we work our ambulatory triage. We have mid-levels at our triage booth. We all get the story and then mid-levels place initial orders for labs, imaging, meds, etc. We then decide on either a ready bed or if they go to our rapid intake. 

So anyway, we get a young girl, 24-25 IIRC. She's got some noticeable gait problems. States she has a ""working diagnosis"" of Guillain-Barrè starting about 9 months ago with no initial sickness or viral infections. Had to completely relearn to walk. A few days prior she began losing hand strength again. And then that day had some serious gait changes. Very jerky movements, side to side rocking. 1 assist at best. 

So we get her a ready bed. Obviously concerned for progression to respiratory distress and need for a neuro consult. We were all very intrigued and thinking possible MS. As triage, she left the WR and I quickly forgot about her. 

A few days later I ran into the same mid-level who was working with me and asked if she had heard anything. Turns out she was diagnosed with Conversion disorder. I'm blown away. I had never seen that diagnosis in my relatively short time working. So my questions are for people who are maybe a bit more well versed in psych disorders. 

As far as conversion disorder is concerned and the associated neuro symptoms. How much is voluntary and how much is feigning? From what I read almost everything fits. Specific gait changes, stress induced, slightly flat affect and disinterest or lack of concern for symptoms. Makes sense but how much is real and how much is voluntary changes?",78,90,2014-02-17,PHARMA,0.09677501767873764,0.8759565353393555,0.027268514037132263

We typically leave the needle in between doses, and I presume this is just so that we don't have to prick them 3 times/day. 

I'm a volunteer in an ER. Last night I asked a nurse out of curiosity why the needle doesn't get clotted. She described how before starting a new dose, the needle has to be flushed, and sometimes flushing it is initially met with resistance. Her hypothesis (seemed somewhat certain, actually) was that this was in fact because the needle had been clotted. Would that not lead to an embolism though?

medicine,German Dr House,"Just saw it in a TV show and thought it would be interesting what reddit thinks about his idea.
So, there is this doctor, Dr. Schäfer from Marburg, he got doctor of the year 2013, he began showing his students the series Dr House and tried to teach them with that how to handle difficult diseases.
He founded the Centre of undetected diseases (Zentrum für unerkannte Krankheiten). He got himself a team of doctors and now finds with them answers to some mystery cases, just like Dr House. 
Per week he gets about 50(!) new patient files, from doctors all over the country, who can't find any answers.
He and his team found also a generic defect which is found by identical twins with a chance of 1:300000000.

The only thing what is different to Dr House is that he isn't a asshole :D

You are never good enough. You are a fucking shit stain. Its even worse when you are scrubbed in with said asshole for 4 fucking hours.  

I used to enjoy seeing patients and making diagnoses. Taking history, doing physicals and all that. Now I don't know anymore. Being bullied all through school was bad enough and now I get to relive that, only this time I can't get away. Why is it that every rotation has one such cunt and all it takes is 5 mins for them to just ruin your whole rotation? Why do other doctors not step in? Why does everyone just fucking sit back and watch?   

Most days I roll with it. I fucked up, I'm just a med student still trying to make head or tail of everything they are throwing at me. It was my fault, I should have studied a little longer the night before. Maybe slept a little less. Gone over the anatomy again in the morning before scrubbing in. But somedays, being a fucking whipping post gets too tiring. I want to yell at them and tell them what a fucking cunt they are, walk out of the OR, or simply I just want them to stop. That'll be enough.
