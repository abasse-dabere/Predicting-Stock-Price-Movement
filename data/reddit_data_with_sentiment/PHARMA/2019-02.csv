pharmacy,Retail-induced panic attack?!!,"So this just happened today. Throwaway. 

A pharmacist from my local Chocolate-Vanilla-Strawberry dispensary went into a full blown panic attack and was literally forced by the store manager to shut the pharmacy down mid-shift! 

The pharmacy was egregiously understaffed with just 2 techs. Normally there‚Äôd be at least 5-6 techs as they fill about 400-500 daily.  But with the recent hour cuts...it‚Äôs been a shitshow!


 There were lines of customers out the wazoo and a line in drive thru and a mountain pile of scripts not being typed.  A couple of customers went to the store managers to complain about the lack of staff....which led the store managers to walk back there and noticed that the pharmacist was just shut down from their surrounding and not responding appropriately.  The managers closed the gates and sat the pharmacist down who was completely bewildered.  They took the pharmacist‚Äôs BP and it was like....in the 170s/high-90s, whIch is completely abnormal for the pharmacist.  The managers wouldn‚Äôt let the pharmacist drive themself home so they called someone else to take the pharmacist home.  Like what the actual fuck is going on with this shitshow pharmacy company?!!! 

It‚Äôs fucking ridiculous. FUCKING insane.  I‚Äôm fucking livid.  How much longer are we going to put up with this?  Patient lives are at stake. OUR fucking lives are at stake. The fact that customers complained and were concerned for the pharmacist speaks volumes about the direction this company is going??

We all know that retail pharmacy is an understaffed, overworked, extremely stressful environment.  Despite this, I can kind of understand why some pharmacists stick with it (i.e. they can't get hospital positions and don't want to go back to school to change professions entirely).

When comments like,

I'd love some insight from people outside the US about whether this attitude is universal or specific to the American healthcare system. Maybe it's just because the system sucks so much, and doctors are the face of it? I don't know, but feels bad man . . . we bust our butts to become doctors and the vast majority of us are at least partially altruistic.

I should have titled this ""why is public opinion increasingly anti-medicine,"" because many of y'all are rightfully pointing out that truly doctors are still a respected profession.

medicine,Dear Outpatient Physicians: Can You Please Stop Frightening Your Patients with Asymptomatic Hypertension?,"I need to speak out to the community in order to get something off my chest.

I've seen too many patients sent to the ED for treatment of their asymptomatic hypertension.  I don't mind seeing your patients on an urgent basis, assuming that you are truly concerned that may have an emergency condition or if you believe they need inpatient treatment.  However, I don't like it when you force patients to come to the ED with scare tactics.

Recently, I've been presented with many patients sent to the ED simply for an elevated blood pressure reading in the absence of any worrisome symptoms or signs.  To make matters worse, these patients have been told a variety of alarmist proclamations, such as: ""you're going to have a stroke,"" ""that's heart attack level blood pressure,"" or ""you're going to have an aneurysm.""  One such patient was actually told that she was having a stroke, based on her blood pressure reading alone in the absence of any focal neurological deficit.  One such patient was actually ""stroke alerted"" by my triage nurse (despite not having any true neurological complaints), which caused a tremendous waste of time and resources, not to mention the potential for harm to the patient.

Naturally, these patients are terrified.  They trust their outpatient physician and are skeptical when I tell them that hypertension is just a number.  It takes a lot of time and effort to talk these patients down and help them recognize the actual importance of long term control of their blood pressure.  Many are slow to understand the idea that a rapid drop in their blood pressure is more likely to cause an actual stroke and that a high blood pressure alone is not going to cause a stroke in the short term.

If you are actually concerned that your patient is suffering from a ""hypertensive emergency"", please send them directly to the ED.  (There is no such entity as ""hypertensive urgency."")  That's why we exist.  However, please don't use the ED as an ""easy button"" to avoid actual assessment of your patient or to avoid a conversation with your patient.  It's easy enough to find out if the patient is suffering from any symptoms that might be attributable to a hypertensive emergency; if they are not, and there are no focal neurological deficits, then it is safe for you to refer that patient to their primary care physician for sane and rational treatment of their essential hypertension.  If you are a primary care physician yourself, it's pretty simple to ascertain whether or not it is safe to manage that patient's hypertension in clinic with a few minutes of interview on the phone.  Hypertensive emergencies are not subtle; their manifestations are dramatic.

If you are in doubt, feel free to send these patients to the ED for evaluation.  However, please do not dramatize the risks.  No one is going to have a stroke because they delayed treatment of their hypertension by a few days, weeks, or months.  No one will have a heart attack if they delay starting HCTZ by a fortnight.  Your patient is not going to have a brain aneurysm in the next hour, even if their systolic is 200.  (Coincidentally, most of the asymptomatic hypertension patients I see are sent to the ED because their systolic is greater than 200 or their diastolic is greater than 100; funny how 190 seems so much less threatening than 202.)  When you terrify your patient, you make my job much harder because I have to talk them back down from the cliff while also trying to encourage them into taking their chronic asymptomatic hypertension seriously.

In case you're thinking it--no, a headache is not a sign of ""end-organ damage.""  A headache with focal neurological deficits or decreased level of consciousness may be, but a simple tension or migraine headache is not.  Please dig a little deeper in the history before you tell a patient that they are going to die from their headache and that they need immediate emergency department care.  

Patients ought to be sent to the ED based on their symptoms, not isolated numbers.  Someone with a BP of 88/40 who is afebrile, alert, oriented, and well appearing is probably not in shock but rather has a small upper arm.  An otherwise asymptomatic and healthy adult with cold fingers and an SpO2 of 88% is probably not dying.  An athlete with a resting pulse of 40 BPM is not in symptomatic bradycardia.  The otherwise healthy young man with a partial RBBB observed on his ECG is not in heart failure.  The patient who was incidentally found to have a 13K WBC on routine labs is not in sepsis.  The guy with an oral temperature of 94.4F that was obtained after drinking cold water does not have hypothermia.  In each case, we keep the clinical scenario in mind when interpreting the data.  Blood pressure is no different.

I understand when a patient themselves freaks out at a high blood pressure reading or when a ""nurse line"" instructs a patient to come to the ED for their asymptomatic hypertension.  In those cases, no one who knows better is present to weigh the evidence and offer medical advice.  However, when I see a patient referred by an actual physician for asymptomatic hypertension, it disheartens me.  As doctors, regardless of our specialty, we should know better and we should take the time to actually assess our patients.  This is something that everyone who went to medical school ought to know, regardless of your specialty.  You don't need to keep up to date on the latest in blood pressure management or other primary care topics, but you ought to understand the difference between a true ""hypertensive emergency"" and asymptomatic hypertension.  

In conclusion, please take the time to actually assess your patients and be honest with them.  A few minutes of additional history, even over the phone, can save countless hours of a patient's otherwise wasted time, the efforts of emergency department staff, thousands of wasted dollars in resources, and, most importantly, your patient's mental anguish.  If you just want me to start your patient on HCTZ for their essential hypertension because your clinic is booked out three months in advance, go ahead and send them to me, but please don't terrify your patient with the idea that they are going to stroke out unless they are treated immediately.  (I want to add that the worst offenders are not primary care doctors, but rather specialists and proceduralists who don't know what to do with hypertensive patients.) 
 Don't do this for me or my nurses--do it for the sake of your patients and their trust in you (you're going to look silly after they learn from me that their brain isn't going to explode due to their asymptomatic hypertension, regardless of the number).  

Thank you for humoring my long winded rant.

(As an aside, I hate the term ""hypertensive emergency"" just as much as ""hypertensive urgency.""  It makes it seem like the blood pressure is the primary problem, when it is not.  ""Hypertensive emergency"" just means a medical condition in which blood pressure management is an important consideration.  You cannot have an ""hypertensive emergency"" without the underlying emergency condition, such as an aortic dissection, aneurysmal SAH, acute heart failure, renal failure, eclampsia, brain herniation, or stroke.  The disease that gets closest to an actual ""hypertensive emergency"" is malignant hypertension, which is a rare presentation seemingly driven by the elevation in blood pressure.  In all others, the hypertension is driven by the underlying pathology.)",322,526,2019-02-05,PHARMA,0.12065194919705391,0.8542092144489288,0.02513881865888834

medicine,OVIVA Trial: 6-weeks of oral abx non-inferior to IV abx for osteomyelitis.,"Hey r/medicine

I wanted to share a pragmatic non-inferiority trial comparing 6 weeks of oral Abx vs 6 weeks of IV abx for osteomyelitis.

During residency so far it has always been 6 weeks of IV abx for diagnosis of osteomyelitis (of course having infectious disease involved for this and follow-up). The study finding that oral abx were non-inferior to IV abx challenges this practice.

One area of criticism I had was the non-inferiority margin of 7.5% in absolute risk reduction (I thought it was too high), but the upper confidence interval of the risk difference was well below that (around 2.5%) across ITT, modified ITT, and per protocol analysis. The results seem fairly robust.

medicine,Prominent women physicians in Canada have started a petition against the University of Toronto on their handling of Dr. Marko Duic's case.,"Dr. Marko Duic is an ER physician, accused of not hiring any female physicians for the past 16 years in his department ([source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-scrubbed-ontario-emergency-room-chief-faces-questions-about-failing/)). Recently, he [resigned](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/investigations/article-ontario-emergency-room-chief-who-hired-no-women-for-16-years-resigns/) from his administrative role because of the allegations, so why are female physicians in Canada still going ahead with the petition?

It's because he continues to work as a physician and teacher in U of T's affiliated hospital. In response to the allegations of discrimination, U of T gave a fairly standard non-answer, saying that their 'internal investigation' found no evidence of discrimination by Dr. Duic (though the fact that he only chose male trainees might have skewed the evaluations the investigation was based on). This may be an interesting case of an institution choosing to protect one of its own in response to public pressure, but I wonder what my colleagues/residents/attendings on reddit think about it.

medicine,Patient satisfaction frustration,"I work in a family practice usually seeing a high percentage of sick visits while the doctor sees scheduled follow ups.  During the summer months our satisfaction scores are fairly similar.  During cold and flu season my survey scores hit the tank.  




Today was a prime example of a patient who was reasonable during the summer when they had an acute issue now unreasonable because ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything to help her.‚Äù  



Patient a is a mid 20s female in reasonable health with reason for visited listed as flu.  When I see this I‚Äôll have the nurse go ahead and swab before seeing the patient if the patient wants to be tested for flu as the test takes a long time.  Patient a decided she didn‚Äôt want any swab in her nose so she declines.





I make it in to see her, ask what‚Äôs wrong, and perform an exam.  She has mild uri symptoms less than 2 days in duration, afebrile, and generally appears well.  I let her know it appears that she has a viral upper respiratory infection.  I discuss what findings lead me to this conclusion, expected duration of symptoms, recommend some non-pharmacological measures to try at home to help with symptoms, let her know I‚Äôll send some cough syrup to help with night time cough, and a work note to take 1-3 days off for recovery.




She gives me a blank stare, ‚Äúso are you going to give me an antibiotic shot?‚Äù  




I reiterate that her problem is much more likely a viral illness and further explain how an antibiotic would likely offer no benefit while having risk of adverse effects.  Her response ‚Äúso you‚Äôre not going to help me today?‚Äù



After that she stands up and leaves.  




I feel like she is the rare, maybe 1-2 a week out of the 100 or so patients I see, but they seem more inclined to complete a survey and boom bad job for me.

pharmacy,Hi Pharmacists!! Please be careful when counseling opioid-dependent patients on Narcan!!,"I know there's been a lot of people pushing for pharmacists/doctors to give Narcan to any patient on ER/LA opioids.  

Just wanted to share what recently happened to one of my patients.

Pt is 86yo, has been on oxycodone ER 20mg q12h for 5 or 6 years.  Rare use of IR - she'll take an oc/apap 5/325 on occasion but averages only 5 of those pills per month.  No benzos, muscle relaxants, or other sedative/hypnotics.  She has severe COPD and is on the full bevy of meds for that.  

When I discussed Narcan with her, she declined the rx b/c (1) she lives alone; (2) she's been on these meds a long time without ever suffering signficant resp depression.  

Then her pharmacist told her ""there's a new law"" and she HAD to accept a Narcan nasal spray.  The pharmacist, who's been filling her COPD meds for over a decade, told her the following (according to the patient, but basically confirmed by the pharmacist): ""You can die from an overdose but this medicine will prevent it.  The main sign of overdose is trouble breathing.  So if you're ever having trouble breathing, you can use this Narcan and it will make you breathe again.""  

Later that day, when my patient was having ""trouble breathing,"" she took the Narcan instead of her albuterol.  Instant withdrawal - she pooped herself, her BP skyrocketed, and she started having heart palpitations and SOB.  She was afraid she was dying and called an ambulance.  After a few hours in the E.R., the naloxone wore off.  But she had thousands of dollars in unnecessary tests and suffered immensely during what she called ""the worst 3 hours of my life.""  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a big supporter of distributing naloxone.  But it needs to be done thoughtfully.   When people need a dose of naloxone, they're generally not conscious and lucid enough to administer it to themselves.  IMO, the counseling needs to be about using Narcan to save someone else, not ""take this if you're ever feel SOB"".  I've never had a patient overdose on a substance I prescribed.  That doesn't mean that it couldn't happen in the future, but I think the efforts at naloxone distribution would be better focused on young folks who use opioids recreationally/illicitly and less on little old ladies taking stable doses of ER/LA opioids who live alone.",63,437,2019-02-07,PHARMA,0.130925714969635,0.8415986895561218,0.027475548908114433

pharmacy,'' You breathe it in'',"Happened the other day at work, made me smile:

Woman comes in with two children with an Rx for a liquid antibiotic for her son. I ask her what kind of infection did the doctor say he had.  She answers '' a lung infection ''. So I continue to process the script and ask about details, etc. 

She's sounds super concerned and even a little exasperated and asks '' How does that even happen? How do people even get lung infections?'' I look up to see if she's talking to me or the kids. I think she might have been asking me but she was looking at the girl who is maybe around 7 years old. She continues '' how of does the bacteria get into your lungs???  I don't know these things! '' I was about to answer but the little girl beats me to it and says  ''You breathe it in'' - flat voice, flat expression.

pharmacy,Important not to forget the impact that illness can have on family/relatives/caregivers,"I received a phonecall from a man at his wits end today. His wife hadn't slept in days due to severe agitation because of anxiety. She had just started fluoxetine which was likely exacerbating symptoms and hadn't slept in days. She was taking maximum dose zopiclone and was only managing to sleep for around an hour. I told him to arrange an emergency consult with one of the GPs and he came into the Pharmacy later in the afternoon to pick up a script for her for diazepam 5mg tds. 

I wanted to help his wife as best as I could, particularly as I wholly empathised with her as unfortunately I have suffered from similar experiences. I talked to him about mindfulness, breathing techniques, re-assuring her to wait for the fluoxetine to have efficacy, good sleep hygiene etc but I was like a deer in headlights and realised that although the advice might have been useful; he was also looking for empathy, support and re-assurance for himself.

He was talking about the anxiety being contagious and how he was struggling with sleep due to worrying about his wife. I was blindsided and completely missed this because I was focused on the patient at hand.

I think it's easy to miss subtle signs that a caregiver may be needing a bit more support or reassurance. I was annoyed at myself afterwards when I realised that I could've offered him a bit more advice and support for himself and wish I'd told him that while he is doing well to support his wife, he needs to consider his own emotional wellbeing and perhaps consider options for himself if he's stressed.

This is pretty common when I think more about it. Many of our psych patients are housebound and obviously there are patients who are incapacitated physically and need their family to pick up scripts for them.

As primary care practitioners we need to take the opportunity to ask the caregivers how they're doing and whether they're getting support. It's an easy thing to miss when we're busy and/or blindsided by treating the actual patient. But it's important as it could improve healthcare outcomes for both caregiver and the actual patient.

May be obvious to most of you but I'm relatively new in this profession and it's an area I hope to improve upon as part of my practice.",11,158,2019-02-07,PHARMA,0.0676175057888031,0.8959574699401855,0.036424994468688965
medicine,Nurse or medical assistant giving you report on a patient you‚Äôre about to see: ‚ÄúHe stopped all of his meds.‚Äù,"When I worked as an employed physician doing outpatient family practice, I got this in report at least a couple of times a week. Nothing would make me facepalm harder. I never had the time to explore what motivated a patient to do this; I typically needed to spend the little time I had with them covering my behind and making sure they understood that they were prescribed what they were prescribed for a reason, and that some serious and unpleasant things could happen to them if they stayed off them. Now that I‚Äôm out of that rat race, I‚Äôd like to satisfy my curiosity: what is the typical psychology behind this most foolish action, in your experience? How do you tend to deal with patients who do this?

Of note, I noticed that this act of defiance did not typically extend so far as any of the scheduled substances they were prescribed. Also of note, patients who pulled this tended to be people with a lot of major life problems I couldn‚Äôt possibly fix (though they may have hoped otherwise), who didn‚Äôt strike me as paragons of wise decision making.

I‚Äôm thinking this phenomenon might have something to do with psychological locus of control. Like a frustrated kid refusing to participate in class, or a homeless person treated to a free meal who complains and sends it back, I wonder if a typical compulsive med-stopper may be a person who feels a profound lack of control over most things in their life, and so they grasp for something over which to exert control, even if it hurts them. It‚Äôs cutting off their nose to spite their face. I also wonder if in many cases such patients were trying to send a message to me about just how little faith they had in my ability to help them, or how little faith they had that their life situation could ever get better. ‚ÄúIn case I didn‚Äôt make myself clear, Doc, FML!‚Äù

I was tempted a few times to be a hardass with such patients, and tell them that if they weren‚Äôt going to do their part, or waste my time with drama, they could stop being my patient and find a new doctor. But... do no harm. If this action was a cry for help, such an response from me could be the last thing they needed.

I‚Äôd be interested in hearing how other clinicians, at all levels, have handled patients telling you that they‚Äôve stopped all their meds.",58,101,2019-02-07,PHARMA,0.0871337354183197,0.8808923959732056,0.03197390213608742

EDIT: So most of you are correct. It seems like there is a PTX on the right, but it is actually a skin fold. Many excellent answers below answer why, but the fact that the fissure crosses the ""PTX"" line is what gives it away.

What ended up happening: the fellow ultrasounded the chest and he had clear lung sliding. Since we can't save our ultrasound images, we ended up getting a repeat CXR with the arms outstretched (TSA pose). Here is the repeat CXR: [https://imgur.com/a/BJA4L8T](https://imgur.com/a/BJA4L8T)

pharmacy,"Evaluating the controversial opinion of residencies being ""scams""","Many times I have seen on here that residencies are scams by hospital institutions to pay new grads less, but its often met with controversy. Why is that? I would give the opinion that its because of the amount of stakeholders in the residency system, and biases for and against. You have the current or past residents, who dont want to feel disillusioned with what they do or the career path theyve chosen. You have the residency and hospital directors, whos bottom line directly benefits from residents not gettin paid like normal pharmacists. On the flip side, we also could have those who regret not doing or getting a residency, but that seems like a [minority opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/annaej/to_my_retail_working_pharmacists_if_you_could_go/). There are also plenty of people who were told that ""A PharmD is a PharmD"" by academia, and that there was no further degree that could qualify you to do more in the profession, but academia later switched their stance to push residencies instead, so I guess the majority of people who think they are scams fall into this camp.

How much are residents paid these days? [This journal article suggest that the benefit-to-cost ratio is 1.5:1 for pharmacy residents in a VA system.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21048213) Another article [shows that residents have a benefit-to-cost ratio of 1.4:1.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10128358) Note that these benefit-to-cost ratios are benefits *to the hospital,* not the resident. The first article mentions that at one VA hospital, residency programs accounted for savings of over half a million dollars annually. 

So why would we see big, academia-supported organizations like APhA and ASHP, be anti-resident, but pro-residency? Probably because they are paid to lobby by academia and these health systems that support residencies. [ASHP lobbied against pay increases to residents that wouldve resulted from Department of Labor changes (pg 3).](https://www.ashp.org/-/media/assets/professional-development/residencies/docs/communique-fall-2016.ashx) Seems pretty anti-resident to me. [APhA did the same,](https://www.pharmacist.com/new-federal-overtime-rules-likely-have-implications-pharmacy-residents) and had the audacity to say: **""According to APhA, the final rule does not exempt pharmacy residents, leaving them among the millions of health care workers who will soon see a bigger paycheck... the new rules could place a prohibitive strain on already cash-strapped residency training programs...""** Tell me, who is more cash-strapped, a new grad with 200k in student loans, who is workin 60 hours a week for less than 50 grand a year, or a health system that, as I showed previously, literally makes money off of their residency programs? That is why there are a number of us who think its a scam, to just further profits of a health system and decrease the amount of pay they would give for training on the job. Plus, it would be more legitimate if they were paid resident pay for the training or specialized rotations, and normal pay for staffing. Except, it seems like its just an excuse for cheap labor also.

Anyone with differing opinions, could you tell me why it ever became necessary to pay pharmacists less for on-the-job training, to now being a job requirement? Any positive, non-academia bullshit things that residencies contribute to our profession that we cant have without them?

I actually feel for the new grads and people who seek residencies. Even tho I disagree with the institution of residency, I think gettin a competitive advantage for yourself is great. Institutions shouldnt take advantage of you so you can be trained, like pharmacists did for full pay for decades before residencies were a big thing.

Just more academia bullshit, for shits and giggles: [""**the apex is the ideal PharmD with Residency and Dual Degree training.**""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475774/figure/F1/)",155,106,2019-02-09,PHARMA,0.12969963252544403,0.8446434140205383,0.025657009333372116

pharmacy,"""Numbercare"" versus Healthcare (Rant)","Hi all - I work in a clinic based independent pharmacy, where a lot of my patients have low health literacy, and due to the world of polypharmacy, clinically meaningful DUR problems often come up, e.g. therapeutic duplication from multiple providers, dose changes, etc. So, I can't even ask patients if they know about changes. Luckily, I have access to their charts in the clinic (SOAP notes, med list, etc), so I have at least some tool to resolve them. But, if they see specialists outside of the clinic network (which happens often), then I have to do more work. It may entail calling insurance (because insurance DUR rejects state the therapeutic or pharmacologic class duplication, but not the drug name, so Breo here and Ventolin elsewhere is okay, but I've seen patients fill Breo and Anoro, which is insanity), calling that pharmacy to ask for prescriber info, and then reaching out to them for a targeted med rec. I then d/c the meds on my profile and contact the appropriate prescribers to d/c on their end, so that they stop sending it. And then I have to counsel the patient about the changes.

That's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the level of care I provide, despite having inadequate support staff. 

One of the higher up pharmacists came in to rant about how my site's prescription count has declined. When I stated the reasons why, I was told I'm the only pharmacist in my company who does a prospective DUR. I then was expected to come up with a plan to increase Rx count. 

I guess this is what the profession of community pharmacy has become. Unless my DUR interventions are reimbursed well, then it doesn't matter to the company, even with Outcomes or Mirixa. A pharmacist could dispense the wrong drugs and get away with it, because an ADR-related hospital admission is probably hard to trace back to pharmacy, unless it's blatantly obvious. And even if it was, likely no litigation will be pursued, since the socioeconomic status of this patient population is low. 

But that's definitely the antithesis of why I entered this profession and why I took the pharmacist's oath at graduation. The ultimate goal is to make sure pharmacotherapy is safe and appropriate. There is no hope for the profession of community pharmacy, even outside of corporate retail.

However, I just have to say before I unsubscribe from the sub, that if everyone in pharmacy is like the people who post here, I wish I could unsubscribe from this profession altogether. 

I don‚Äôt post often. And I rarely post negatives. But this is the most toxic, depressing, and unhelpful sub I have ever been a member of. And that makes me terribly sad because this is my profession. This is what I have worked my whole life for. This is what I am going to do with my life whether I like it or not, because this is the investment WE ALL CHOSE. I came here for inspiration, potential networking, useful advice, and ideas for how to advance the profession. I am not a victim, this career did not choose me. 

I‚Äôve asked very simple questions before, like choosing interesting topics for grand rounds presentations, and I‚Äôve been met with the least helpful advice I‚Äôve ever received. Bordering on flat out rude. None of the pharmacists I know in real life are like this, and I am so confused as to why this is the culture here. 

The complaints y‚Äôall have, and the amount of bitching y‚Äôall do every. single. day. about stuff that everyone has to deal with in any sort of ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù position... or hell, any JOB in general....

Your job and your life are what you make it, and I would just like to see this sub be more than a huge bitch-fest about how horrible your life and job are. We are and can be so much better than that.

I don‚Äôt mean to hate on every person here, but can y‚Äôall not see that we are blessed? We are gifted. And we have so much potential.

&gt; Pharmacies are good in a pinch, but some vaccines are multi-injection, and some may not be appropriate. A doctor will know all of that.

Because pharmacists can't administer a multi-dose series?  Because pharmacists won't know which vaccines are inappropriate for a specific patient?

*From u/centrum5555:*

&gt; but like i said, you really need to speak to a real doctor to know what exactly you need.

Yup, all those PharmDs with their fake doctorates are incapable of determining which vaccines are recommended for a given patient, despite the fact that vaccines are medications and therefore fall directly within a pharmacist's area of expertise.

*From u/Anderj12:*

&gt; FUCK EVERYONE ON HERE RECOMMENDING RETAIL PHARMACIES FOR THIS!!!!!!! Do not go here!!!

&gt; Retail pharmacies DO NOT care about you or your actual health. They want your money!!!

I think I speak for all of us when I say that the accusation that retail pharmacists do not care about the health of their patients is as insulting as it is depressing.

*Another from u/Anderj12:*

&gt; So their job is to make money off of his immunizations, not properly prescribe the ones he actually needs.

These fools legitimately believe that we would administer unnecessary vaccines to a patient in an attempt to make money.  Perhaps I'm naively optimistic, but I believe that 99% of pharmacists would find the very notion of doing so disgustingly unethical, and even the remaining 1% would likely be deterred due to the threat of a lawsuit.

I can't wrap my head around why our profession is so disrespected (meanwhile people act like nurses are god's gift to medical knowledge when they generally only have bachelor's degrees).  Pharmacists know just as much about immunizations as physicians do, and I would argue that in some cases they know even more (e.g. my dad was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis when he was 59 and given Prevnar by his pulmonologist, despite the fact that Pneumovax was the recommended pneumococcal vaccine in his case).  And sadly, the opinions I quoted above line up precisely with what I experienced from patients when I was practicing.

I'm interested in going into surgery, but heard a bit about the ""machismo"" in the US where surgeons refuse to sit while performing surgery and that they see residents who take a seat as weak and not worthy of going into the profession.

However, in the hospitals that I've had a chance to observe in (Europe, Asia, South America), I've noticed that surgeons don't seem to share the same attitude. If their operation is long, they'll ask for a stool, or just have one from the very beginning. Is the too-good-to-sit attitude limited to North America? Or to certain specialties?

So a question for the surgeons on meddit -- do you sit? From the very beginning? Or only after a few hours when you get tired? How do you view young trainees that want to sit? And if you could add where you practice that would be great!

2. Thou shalt know thy patient, lest you admit that thou hast not seen the imaging or read through the last consultant's note.
3. Thou shalt have done a basic workup to aid in commandment #2.
4. Bonus: Thou shalt not feed a patient if thou hast consulted surgery with requests for an emergent intervention.

&amp;#x200B;

I broke 1 and 2 today. We had a patient with PVD who had a new wound. My attending said, ""consult vascular"". I did. The vascular resident (full disclosure: really smart guy who knows me and who I respect) asked \*why\* I was consulting them, i.e., what was I hoping vascular would do. I paused.  A guy with PVD and a wound is as common as an anesthesiologist wearing a Hawaiian shirt on rounds. I knew this wasn't a surgical candidate. Wound care was on board. Why was I calling vascular?  Then the resident asked me how his peripheral pulses were. Lots of stammering on my end. Of course I should have known that.  Big difference between someone who has intact pulses vs. a guy who has no DP even on doppler.

&amp;#x200B;

The actual question was what workup we should do to see how bad this guy's leg was and whether vascular surgery thought we should do anything besides mere wound care, whether he should be followed outpatient, etc. Different question, more specific. 

&amp;#x200B;

The consult resident can get 20+ requests a day. Everyone benefits when we know why we're doing something and have done enough basic legwork to give a concrete answer. As for #4, if you want gen surg to take out a guy's gallbladder, look at the US yourself and don't have him chowing down on a hamburger when we visit.

medicine,Games I play with pediatric patients,"I'm a pediatrician.  Part of what we do is to make our patients relax.  This is also part of the exam, because a smiling, laughing kid is probably not a truly sick kid.  And a ticklish belly is not an acute abdomen.  

* The ear is an undiscovered country.  Here there be lions, tigers and bears, oh my!  I might have forgotten to mention the monkeys.  When I first started, I just counted monkeys.  Over the years, I've started to discover that they play basketball, hopscotch and, parchisi.  They often cook meals, but they never wash their dishes.  A few years ago, I had a patient who had just moved from Australia and wouldn't you know it, there is now an epidemic of kangaroos, koalas, and even crocodiles in ears now.  Another kid moved from Florida and with him came a flamingo and alligator epidemic.  
* I always ask children what they had for breakfast/lunch before I examine their bellies.  Often, they can't seem to remember, so I ask them, ""has your mouth been with you all day today?""  When I do get the answer, I then need to find the various components of their last meal (ticklingly, of course), in great detail.  ""Here's the bun...and over here's the ketchup...and over here's the pickle relish...and the chips are here...and where is the hot dog?  Is it over here?  How about over here?  Oh, heeeere it is!""  Froot Loops are especially fun because you can find an example of each different color.  If they can't remember, then I start to guess.  Hamburger?  Hot dog?  Turkey sandwich?  If I keep getting it wrong, the guesses get weirder.  Mouseburger?  Spider stew?  Monkey brain soup?
* If there are siblings in the room, I'll say: ""You must be Andrew (pointing to Lindsay), and you must be Lindsay! (pointing to Andrew).""  They'll laugh and say: ""nooooooo!""  And then I say: ""Oh, really?""  And then I cross my arms and try again and still get it wrong.  And then cross my arms even more (so it looks completely ridiculous) and still get it wrong.  And then I'll finally get fed up and ask one kid what her name and when she tells me, I'll say: ""Well, why didn't you say so?""
* ""How old are you?  Are you three?  You don't look three.  Are you eight?  Ten?  42?  You don't look 42.""
* I'll count fingers/toes and get it wrong every time, then re-count, and re-count...this can occupy a good 60 seconds.  
* If you have a paper or styrofoam cup, you can stick a tongue depressor through the bottom and voila!  Instant baby rattle!
* In older kids, if I try to do a fundoscopic exam, I'll ask them to stare straight at their parent's or sibling's nose.  ""Is she making funny faces at you?""  ""Now that I brought it up, is she making funny faces at you?""
* With especially silly (and healthy) kids, I'll pick them up, cradling them in my arms.  I'll tell them that the arm holding their legs is strong, but that the arm holding their head is --oops!-- weak and let their head drop, letting them swing upside-down.  This usually exposes a ticklish belly.  
* ""I have some excellent news.  You have a heart.  It's even beating!  I wish I had a heart.  All I have is a lump of ice-cold stone.""  (This gets a giggle from parents).  
* With my 11yos who have to get their shots, I offer them the option of being marched out in the waiting room where they have all the boys or girls (opposite-sex) from their class waiting and we can give them the shots in the butt.  Or they can get them here in the exam room in the arm.  Which would they like?  A bit of perspective works wonders.  ;)  Although I did have one kid take me up on the offer.

pharmacy,PharmD Oversaturation similar to 1910s MD oversaturation,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexner_Report

‚ÄúThe Flexner Report also concluded that there were too many medical schools in the United States, and that too many doctors were being trained.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFlexner carefully examined the situation. Using the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as the ideal,[7] he issued the following recommendations:[8]

1. Reduce the number of medical schools (from 155 to 31) and poorly trained physicians;
2. Increase the prerequisites to enter medical training;
3. Train physicians to practice in a scientific manner and engage medical faculty in research;
4. Give medical schools control of clinical instruction in hospitals
5. Strengthen state regulation of medical licensure‚Äù

‚ÄúTo a remarkable extent, the following present-day aspects of the medical profession in North America are consequences of the Flexner Report:

In a very short time, medical colleges were all streamlined and homogenized (all the students were learning the same thing)

A physician receives at least six, and preferably eight, years of post-secondary formal instruction, nearly always in a university setting;

Average physician quality has increased significantly;

No medical school can be created without the permission of the state government. Likewise, the size of existing medical schools is subject to state regulation;

Each state branch of the American Medical Association has oversight over the conventional medical schools located within the state;

Medicine in the US and Canada has become a highly paid and well-respected profession.‚Äù

Medical schools used to churn out low quality MDs, decreasing quality of patient care and decreased physician salary. Flexner report forced Medical schools to close, cut medical graduates by half (4,000-&gt;2,000) and helped improve quality of medicine. 

PharmD seems to be following a similar pattern of oversaturation as MDs in the old days. However, we can find a similar solution and cut down schools.

pharmacy,The Reality (Ugly Truth) of CVS Pharmacy,"Dear Customers of CVS Pharmacy,¬†

&amp;#x200B;

I am a pharmacy Technician. I've been with CVS for 11 years now, and I just gave my 2 weeks‚Äô

notice. Now that I'm not bound by the social media policy, please allow me to divulge to you just

how CVS corporate works...

&amp;#x200B;

First off, all stores are given a ""budget"" of how many hours they are allowed to have scheduled

each week. The allotted hours must NOT go over budget. If it does, the pharmacist in charge

has to write up why more hours were used...then they get in trouble. The pharmacist gets

written up. This is why nothing is ever ready on time, corporate does not allow stores to

schedule the required help to maintain their stores.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Second, all they care about is ""metrics."" Every week, the store gets a report of scores. How

many people did you sign up for auto-refill? How many people did you sign up for 90-day

supplies? How many people agreed to let you contact their Doctor for more refills? This report

prints out weekly, with a quota. 65% for auto-refill, 55% for 90-day supplies, and 45% for refill

requests. The report has the name of each pharmacy employee, the number of customers they

rang out, and the success percentage. If they are UNDER the quota, they must write up an

action plan on how they will improve their success percentage. If they are constantly below

quota, they get written up. They tell you to ""word it properly"" so people will accept. (Instead of

asking ""would you like us to auto-refill this"" ask ""would you like this ready next time you need it""

so as to make them say yes). If you were signed up for auto- refill without your permission, it's

likely the tech was just trying to save their job.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Every weekend, the technicians are mandated to make ""PCI calls."" These are calls that get put

into a queue when a medication is ""past due"" to be filled. We are required to call every patient

(usually around 200 calls in my store) to see if they need the med filled. This is also counted as

a metric. We need to get 60% success rate of ""patient care initiative"" refills. We must make at

least 3 rounds of these calls, which means if you don't answer, we have to call at least 3 times

over the weekend to get you to fill the past due script.¬†

Robot calls: we cannot control them. Same with text alerts. It's a corporate thing, not a store

thing.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

We have 5 stations in the pharmacy. Drop Off, production, quality assurance, drive thru, and

pick up. In a perfect world, that means there should be 4 technicians and 1 pharmacist. Nope.

Not at CVS. My store is LUCKY if we get 3 techs in the same shift. It's normally only 2 of us.

That means 2 people to type up scripts, fill scripts, make phone calls, take phone calls, do drive

thru, and handle the register. The techs do most of the work. Pharmacists usually just check the

technicians work. We are trying our best.

&amp;#x200B;

Pharmacists are not allowed to take breaks. Most work 10-12 hour shifts with no break and are

lucky if they get to use the bathroom. They have to eat their food in the pharmacy. Technicians

hardly get breaks either. At my store, every employee is ""encouraged"" (practically forced) to

sign paperwork stating that they don't need a break. Once this is signed, you rarely get

breaks...and it's legal. Techs, however, are NOT ALLOWED to keep food in the pharmacy. The

majority of us go the whole day without eating. Depending on the pharmacist (at least in my

store) they will keep your food with theirs in case Lost Prevention comes in... the pharmacist

claims it's their food.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, a lot of techs will work off the clock. It's not allowed, but it's the only way work gets done.

Since we are not allowed to go over hours without getting written up, and if customers complain

that scripts aren't filled, we get written up. It's a lose - lose situation. Last week, our lead

technician worked 40 hours on the clock....and 27 hours off the clock. No lunch breaks. Just to

try and get¬† scripts filled. She worked 7am-10pm Monday to Thursday (No breaks), then 9-4

Friday. This is pretty much the norm.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful when you file a complaint. Corporate does not believe that they are the problem. If

you complain about a pharmacy not having enough help, corporate will send an email to the

store in question, stating the complaint. The pharmacist in charge will then have to contact the

district manager with a written statement stating how the store will improve. If the customer left

their name and phone number, we have to call and make amends.

medicine,"Had a couple close calls, need to vent.","Apologies in advance here.  I don't normally post for stuff like this, but my overnight shift last night shook me up a little bit, and still trying to process the couple of near-misses that I had.  First a little background.  I work at a medium-sized community hospital in a pretty large health system.  I'm on a little stretch of overnights right now.  They're really hit or miss at our hospital, since you have single physician coverage for most of the night.  You can have absolutely terrible ones where you start off bad and never catch up (as in you might not clear the waiting room until like 5 AM), or you might never really have more than like 4 or 5 patients in the ED after midnight.  So I guess that isn't too unusual for overnight shifts in the ED, but it just seemed like in residency there wasn't quite as much variation.

I'm a smidge over 2.5 years out of residency.  I firmly believe that an EM physician who thinks that they have it ""figured out"" is dangerously close to missing something, given the random crap that we see and deal with on a daily basis, but at the same time, I've seen quite a bit in my short career, and I think that I can handle the vast majority of what comes through the door without too much trouble.  Anyways, on to last night.My  last shift started out beautiful.  The first couple of hours were pretty light.  People to see, but nothing too bad to deal with, and we had empty beds in both the ED and the hospital.  It slowed down as the night went on, as it normally will do, and I was looking forward to a pretty decent shift overall.  Then I had two patients that kind of shook me.

The first one was an older guy who came in for chest pain.  Nothing too unusual, see it all the time.  Within like a minute I knew I was going to be admitting him.  The pain was in the chest, went up to his neck.  No dyspnea, some on/off nausea, no diaphoresis.  EKG looked completely normal.  Something just felt a smidge off, but I didn't think too much of it.  He had come in on oxygen from EMS, though it wasn't immediately obvious why.  I took it off of him, and his oxygen right after was like 95%, so I didn't think too much of it.  A couple of minutes later he was 93% on room air, and something still just felt weird.  I couldn't quite tell what it was, and I didn't really know why, but I thought heck, maybe he has a PE.  Worked a somewhat sedentary job, pulse ox a little lower than I'd expect.  I actually hate d-dimers, and think they're over-ordered.  If you're worried about a PE in someone who isn't young, I've always thought just scan them (criticize if you want, but that's not the purpose of the post).  So I scan him.  Blood pressure drifts down a little beforehand, but nothing too low.  On a whim I go over like a minute after he did to CT.  I walk in the room as he's getting the contrast for his CTA chest to rule out PE.  And boom, right there is a huge dissection.  CT tech and I just look at each other like holy crap.  Call the flagship hospital (my shop doesn't have CT surgery), fly him up there for emergency surgery.  His vitals got a little worse prior to flying out, so I probably would have scanned him eventually, but I didn't have a great reason to do it earlier.  Shook me a little bit how lucky I got.

While I'm arranging transport for that patient, a trauma patient came in.  Young guy, single-vehicle MVC rollover.  Complaining of a headache and not much else.  I evaluate him, order CT head, c-spine, and chest/abdomen/pelvis.  The only reason for the chest/abdomen/pelvis was the mechanism.  Has a small laceration to the scalp, bleeding a little but not that much.  CT scans show only a facial fracture.  He hadn't really complained of facial pain or tenderness, so I think that's a little weird.  I'm about to go suture his lac when I think to myself ""you know, maybe just scan his facial bones to make sure there isn't another fracture, the CT head doesn't get the whole face"".  So I send him back to CT.  He comes back, and I go in the room to suture the lac.  My phone goes off while I'm gloved up and about to suture, so I have a tech come in to get the phone out of my pocket.  It had actually gone off three times, the first two there was nobody in the room, and they got it for the third call.  They held the phone up to my ear, and radiology is now telling me that there is an epidural hematoma that they picked up on the facial bones CT.  I call the flagship hospital - we don't have neurosurgery at my shop - and fly him up there.  Fortunately GCS 15 and neuro exam normal upon transfer.

Basically radiology missed the epidural on the CT head.  It wasn't big, but it was there when you go back and look.  I hadn't looked at the images yet - I usually do before discharge - but I could have easily missed it scrolling through fast.  My CT tech - who is VERY good about picking up stuff like that in real time...unofficially of course - didn't see it.  It was the same radiologist that read both the CT head and then the later CT facial bones.  I'm shaking a little thinking that if I hadn't ordered that second CT, this kid would have gone home, fallen asleep, and died.  I know that I've missed stuff.  We all do.  But damn did that one hit home, and I'm not entirely sure why.  I think it was just how close I was to sending that kid home.

Anyways, I apologize for the long post.  Like I said, I don't normally post like this, but I'm just trying to process this.

Edit: As I'm reading through this again, I should give some credit to my nurse for the first patient.  They're the first one who mentioned PE.  In my mind, I initially downplayed it, then came around as I thought about it over the next minute in the room.  Apologies for making it seem like I originally had the idea before.

medicine,Mid-level mutualistic relationship,"After reading through some of the comments on the recent post about stagnant md salary/rising mid level salary I figured I would post my experience.







I am practicing at a rural family clinic in a relatively undesirable area (rural SW).  In general I see 75% cough/cold acute minor complaints.  If there‚Äôs a question of what I should do I walk over and speak with the physician.  He‚Äôll give advice, look at a picture, or in really significant cases actually step in and take a look at a patient. 





I think this type of relationship is really what a mid level should have to practice relatively safe and good medicine.  I miss shit.  Every once and a while I‚Äôll catch something the physician misses.  We respect each other to communicate and understand our relationship is mutually beneficial.






On busy days it may be annoying getting held up for 5-10 minutes to speak about a few patients but he‚Äôs never belittling and always willing to help.  If I‚Äôm needed to do something to help him I make it a point to help out.






This sounds like a lot of extra work for him, but he gets compensated with 50% if whatever productivity bonus.  I think that‚Äôs fair.  Some months he may only get $1000 but there are a handful of months each year he‚Äôll end up with $3000 - $4000.  






I wholeheartedly agree mid levels, whether NP or PA, are not prepared to the same level as physicians.  I know a lot of really bad mid-levels but I do know quite a few that are competent and responsible.  







At the end of the day I‚Äôm not the enemy of mid levels or physicians, I try to do as good a job as I can.

pharmacy,CVS Specialty Story Time,"Throw away, for obvious reasons. I apologize in advance for my formatting issues as I‚Äôm posting from my cell phone. I saw someone post on here about all of the problems they were having at retail, and I wanted to give you all a look into the tumultuous world of specialty. 

I have been employed with Specialty for 2.5 years now, 2 years of that as a Tech. For 6 months prior to being promoted to a technician, I was a PSR. PSRs place refill requests, enroll new patients, talk to patients and doctors offices on inbound calls, etc. I found that department to be rather unbearable. I worked in a cable call center before and in retail, but we know that people are often nastier on the phones than they are in person. I found it especially difficult with getting berated about not being able to ship meds because of whatever reason, because I could empathize with the patients in a way I couldn‚Äôt working in a billing call center for a cable company. You‚Äôre not going to die from not watching your soap operas because you didn‚Äôt pay your bill and we shut your shit off, but you may very well find yourself in a situation if we don‚Äôt ship your HIV meds, transplant meds, etc. it took quite the toll on me and I was burnt out by the end of it. I was very happy whenever I was promoted to a technician. I had the ability to actually fix things and make things happen for patients, instead of telling them the lines corporate told us to say, knowing that no matter how many *****urgent**** emails we sent, they were not likely to get addressed any quicker. Let‚Äôs fast forward to the end of open enrollment season/beginning of welcome season this year. 


Our location had put a hiring freeze on PSRs back in September. That dept has a quite high turnover rate, and were already down 50 people headed into the new year. One day; the entire technician department, many of whom never started out as a PSR, gets an email with a document on how to place refill requests and gets told that they are now provisioned to take inbound calls from patients. Mass panic and confusion ensues. Placing a refill request is only a fraction of what PSRs get in their box of chocolates for the day. Not only did all of the technicians get pulled to answer inbound patient phone calls with NO training whatsoever and no supports to go to for questions, but there were about 1,000 orders that did not ship that night alone. This goes on for about a week, missing nightly orders because no one is actually attending to the orders that were placed, 20,000 RXs awaiting entry, 5,000 emails in just 1 inbox we have for technicians. We get pulled into a meeting with some of the upper management from our site apologizing for the situation, saying that they know what they did was not right, we will get trained before ever being expected to do that again, we would be the last dept to get pulled because we are the last line of defense to getting the orders out, etc. but it is all hot air. 

Over the next few weeks, they pull techs in small groups out of production for the day, into a sad excuse for training. I‚Äôm sorry, but 5 hours in a classroom does not equate to 3 weeks in a classroom, and 3 weeks with a sidejacker, listening to calls and there for help and advice. They‚Äôll pull 7-10 techs to go to this training, and everyone who was already ‚Äútrained‚Äù to answer phone calls, onto inbound calls. They cite hold times as the reason we need to turn the call. They say that the contracts we have require us to answer a call in a certain amount of time and we‚Äôll get fined if we do not meet those requirements. Ok, so what about fines for hundreds of missed orders or being weeks behind in entry??? Mandatory overtime has ensued. People have quit, we are all at our wits end. I don‚Äôt understand how answering a phone call equates to helping a patient, when they ultimately have a lesser chance of getting their order because of decreased manpower working the orders that need to ship. That just leads to repeat calls, increasing wait times on the phones, causing more techs to be pulled, causing more orders to be missed. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle and no one seems to be seeing that in management. Our whole department cares about these patients and making sure their orders ship out so they can stay on their regimens. We don‚Äôt mind making a call out to a patient or doctors office as the situation warrants. We DO mind counterintuitive work that is ultimately affecting our patients, not to mention us. 


This Aetna merger is a steaming pile of shit and has made CVS too large to handle. They have cornered off way too much of the market, forcing people to have to use them based on their insurance, while royally fucking them by not delivering on their promises.

medicine,A question from a pharmacist to PCPs regarding controls,"Hello everyone, I‚Äôm new to this subreddit so please excuse me if this isn‚Äôt the right place to post this discussion. I‚Äôve been practicing as a pharmacist for about a year and a half at this point and wanted to hear from prescribers their perspective on continual monthly prescribing of narcotics/benzos. I see these as two different but linked issues, but will address them differently.

Benzos: When I see a patient on straight Xanax 1-2 mg TID, with no other supportive psych meds, a huge red flag shoots up. My understanding is for the vast majority of situations, benzos should not be the backbone of therapy for anxiety. SSRI/SNRI and/or buspirone should be the backbone (I know there are other pharmacological classes like bupropion that can be tried as well). However time after time I see benzos dished out like candy. I spent about 30 mins talking to a patient yesterday about her therapy and she said her appointments consist of her coming in, her doc asking if she takes her meds and if things are ok, and then writing a script for more Xanax. Why isn‚Äôt there an active attempt to deescalate to a safer agent? Is there a fear the patient won‚Äôt come back? Is there just too much hassle?

Opioids: Dear god the amount of issues revolved around opioids are enough to make a sane man crazy. I have multiple patients that will call starting about a week out for their next fill of hydrocodone and ask daily ‚ÄúWhen can I get it? When did I get it last? Can I get it early (I fill 2 days early already), did the doctor send it in?‚Äù This will repeat monthly. I‚Äôm just curious if they call y‚Äôall the same amount. Anyways, I have some patient with obvious pain issues or cancer patients, this is not about them. This about the able bodied 40 year old dudes that have been unemployed for a decade and have nothing better than to try to score narcs. Why continue writing for them 1 q 4h prn QD? Why is there no plan to deescalate? I‚Äôve seen some theorize that this type of prescribing is an easy guaranteed pay check every month because these patients will come back for their ‚Äúappointments‚Äù. I‚Äôm hoping this isn‚Äôt true.

To summarize my questions:

Why are benzos used so commonly as monotherapy for anxiety?

Why do I never see any attempt (besides 1 patient who underwent successful surgery), to deescalate opioids?

The patients with obvious drug seeking behavior. What do you do to put a stop to it?

I hope none of this came out accusatory. I honestly want to hear your side.

medicine,What to do when you worry your patient would shoot up the hospital?,"MS3 at a medium-sized city safety net county hospital, medicine rotation. Patient is late 20s, male. Emaciated and bitter about the chronic disease (and shitty home life) that has demeaned him so long and turned him into a piece of meat that needs to be fed through tubes.  For 5 days, every interaction with any hospital staff involves screaming, swearing, perseverating in the face of evidence (convinced his vitals and lab values are all wrong), and threats.  Refuses cares, splits, flips, refuses treatment then says he'll accept it but is always found to be away from room, outside smoking. Chart review indicates vague previous diagnosis of psychosis but assessment (with affirmation from psych consult) is worse: schizotypal, i.e. ""terrifying but just outside of any indication for inpatient psych"", i.e. ""nothing we can do--maybe outpatient therapy?"" 

Every profile you've seen of a mass murderer. Thin, white, young male, bitter, put down his whole life, violent verbally and physically. I was the only one there when he called the nurses ""f\*cking n\*\*\*\*\*s"". First time in my short clinical career when I had to consider how to document the n-word in a note. Hoping there won't be as many more times as I'm starting to realize there will be. I'm going into psych. I love humans, but this one lost my empathy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today: ""this is why I wish I'd brought a weapon with me here. You're all f\*cking idiots, I'm superior to all of you""

&amp;#x200B;

I was there with the intern and senior resident when he said this (we had already decided to only see him in a group).  During table rounds, I presented as usual--interval events, subjective (disputes validity of overnight temperature reading indicating fever), vitals (feverish overnight, normothermic at this time), lab values, imaging, assessment, plan. Plan is: discharge asap. At the end, the intern asks, ""do you want to tell him about the comments?"" and I describe the incident. Attendings just switched over and this one hasn't met the guy yet. I say that I am concerned that he could very well show up at the hospital with a machine gun and our team would be his first target. Together we discuss the sincerity of the threat, call psych, I am not on the case anymore, I can have a different patient. 

&amp;#x200B;

Psych is upping the frequency of their follow, helping us find a place he can go to on discharge that will handle both his medical needs and need to be behind locked doors. I don't think security was called. I looked up red flag laws in my state, efforts are being made to put it in place but it's not here yet. I keep picturing what would happen. I spent the day assessing safety exits and looking up laws in my state. I want to call the police and have them check his house for guns, but the indications aren't met and it doesn't seem HIPAA-compliant. But I'm just a medical student and I only have so much pull.

The [petition](https://www.change.org/p/protect-the-profession-we-honor-and-cherish-for-the-coming-decade-and-beyond) garnered attention from leaders of ACCP, APhA, and ACPE who [responded](https://www.aacp.org/article/joint-response-petitioners-seeking-moratorium-accreditation-new-pharmd-institutions) within about a week (probably to try to put out the fire before it spread). With mostly some BS.

Apparently, the movement continues and the organizers just updated their asks/demands list which is pretty compelling. There is even a website now asking for volunteers and suggestions - [changepharmacy.org](http://changed-pharmacy.org/)

**The new demands from the #ChangePharmacy movement mention things like:**

**- Banning pharmacy metrics**

**- Reducing pharmacy¬†class sizes by 10 percent**

**- Overhauling current ACPE standards**

**- Creating tasks force to support pharmacist well-being**  
**- Banning off the clock work**

medicine,The Old Guard,"I am an attending who started practice this year. My frustrations with the old guard of surgeons continues to this day and I had an especially annoying day with a senior consulting surgeon.

My primary frustrations include:

1. Implications the medicine was better or harder when they began - I can not even agree with this as a 33 year old. They practiced based on at best limited evidence which was only available if you went to the library before every case. I still can't figure out what they were doing working 120+ hours, but I definitely hear about it even as an attending. What the hell were you doing with all that time because you obviously stopped working that hard now.
2. Their pay - They are still paid much higher than I am as a starting physician, and also started higher. Additionally many have pensions that none of the younger physicians will see.
3. Resistant to change - The EMR is bad, someone else needs to do this for me. The new rules are bad, someone stop them. They literally are non-functional without an APP or resident. It's embarrassing. I don't NEED a resident to start a case. They are there to learn. Why do you NEED someone to type three lines in the computer for me.
4. Implications younger surgeons don't work hard enough to be good - this one is self explanatory. I look at the way they practice and think about 50% need to remediate or read more. I am however in no position to say this and usually experience trumps evidence where I work.

pharmacy,My salary is so low that I feel cheated. Pharmacy school wasn't worth it.,"I started my journey to becoming a pharmacist in 2009. I worked as a tech for a few years while getting my bachelors degree. Then I graduated in 2018. I got two job offers. One at a rural Appalachian hospital for $45 an hour. The other offer was a retail job at $50 an hour.

In my retail job, I only work 30 hours a week, so that translates to 78k per year (before taxes).

After taxes, that is around 55k. Since I went to pharmacy school, I have 210k in loans. My choice is a standard payment of about $2300 per month or the REPAYE loan of $500 per month.

So here's what my monthly budget looks like:

$6500 gross pay

$4575 net pay before deductions

-$2300 loan payment

-$300 medical/dental

-$300 401k

=$1,675 monthly net income after deductions

pharmacy,Atarax vs vistaril,"With the recent back order of buspar continuing and now with vistaril on back order, the area I work in has been prescribing Atarax as an alternative. The prescribers I work with do not prescribe controls hence why the switch. The discussion we go into though (which I admit I never learned and felt incredible dumb to learn this now) , is vistaril is much more lippophilic than atarax, therefore crosses the BBB and this is why it's used more for anxiety. 

My colleagues and myself decided that we should find some evidence, write something up and send it to our providers in order to make the back order easier on them, us and our local pharmacies. The issue is, nowhere have we been able to find a reputable source to site. It seems to be lots of theories based on how the different salt forms SHOULD act, but nothing on how they actually do.

Does anyone have any studies or articles from a good resource that may have something we can use? I found one search result on pharmacist letter and unfortunately it's not even in their archive anymore.",41,45,2019-02-25,PHARMA,0.03074173629283905,0.932614266872406,0.036644045263528824

medicine,Thoracic aortic dissection starts to code: should you start chest compressions?,"So this is something that occurred to me an some colleagues a few days ago when we were talking about a patient who had a possible thoracic aortic dissection. I can't really find any literature or recommendations on it. Should you actually provide chest compressions, or just make sure they get into the OR ASAP?

The reason we thought you might not want to do it came down to the fact that you can consider that providing chest compressions might actually increase blood loss and/or worsen the aortic tear, which are more acutely damaging than ischaemia. Ofcourse, I suppose this might also depend if it's an ascending or descending aortic dissection, because if it's solely a descending dissection you would still perfuse the brain adequately with compressions.

So my question: what is the standard protocol to do if someone with a thoracic aorta dissection codes in front of you?",157,273,2019-02-27,PHARMA,0.045652978122234344,0.923183023929596,0.03116399422287941
