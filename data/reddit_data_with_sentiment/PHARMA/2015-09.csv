medicine,Critical Thinking,"TL;DR: Am I going to be running algorithms (patient comes in with HTN --&gt; Diuretics) or am I going to be thinking critically and solving puzzles? (I know it's not either or, but if anyone could get me a clue on the mix, I'd be grateful. FWIW, I'm thinking IM or Psych right now).

**Background**

I'm an M-2 who has been kind of down in the dumps about medicine lately. I feel like I haven't been using my brain/solving any puzzles which is kind of why I got into medicine.

Then I went to a preceptor session and we say a patient who had unresolving pericarditis with kidney failure, the preceptor asked what we would do since diuretics probably weren't going to work in this case. I thought about it, and remembered some of my immunology mechanisms and said ""what about an anti-inflammatory (to basically tighten up the holes in the vessels)."" 
This happened to be the right answer, which was great, but what I enjoyed more was the critical thinking/problem solving aspect. The puzzle.",34,64,2015-09-01,PHARMA,0.06401805579662323,0.9084749817848206,0.027507025748491287

medicine,How do you deal with abuse?,"Dear meddit,


So recently I spent the entire day getting harassed by my consultant anesthetist. He was extremely rude and uncivil without reason, and constantly criticised me even for things that were not under my control (eg why is the patient late). I'll spare you the details, but needless to say I was rather shaken at the end of the day. Talking to colleagues gave me the impression that he does this to every junior he works with regardless of seniority or experience.


Now none of this is anything new, but what gets to me is that in the place where I work, there seem to be virtually no avenues of recourse available to junior staff in such situations. The culture goes, ""in the old days our bosses used to throw scalpels, be grateful that doesn't happen any more"". Except in especially severe cases eg physical/sexual assault, a complaint to the head of department/chief resident will likely earn you a reputation as a troublemaker, neither are there any anonymous reporting systems.


So, have any of you ever had similar experiences? And how did you deal with them constructively?



Edit: Thanks for the support guys. I suppose I'll consider talking to the PD if this recurs, but the general advice from colleagues is not to rock the boat if you want to continue working in the department.",10,17,2015-09-08,PHARMA,0.11523915827274323,0.8581512570381165,0.026609549298882484

pharmacy,Questions about independent pharmacies,"To anyone out there who owns an independent (or is a partner, or just knows the answers!), I wanted to know how much salary do you take home yearly / what is your average prescription volume per day?

I ask because I may have two offers coming in, one to run a store as basically the only pharmacist there, 58 hours/week, 120 scripts per day avg and I was told the pharmacist makes 200k a year. This seemed really high to me, so I just want to know if that's reasonable or is that low? The second offer is more nebulous, but I have a much higher chance of being taken advantage of. No salary was mentioned but I just want a range so I'll be able to negotiate better.

This fear has increased today: after donating blood I was sitting on a chair having a coke to recover from the procedure when I started feeling unwell. Then I lost consciousness. In a moment, I had four doctors over me taking me to a bed. I wasn't afraid of the needle, I was perfectly well when my blood was being drawn but then I wasn't. WHY? Why me? Have I indulged in auto-suggestion or would the same have happened to a not-afraid-of-anything medical student?

Basically, you can find cephalexin 500mg, amoxicillin 250mg, penicillin 500mg, etc. OTC in pet stores. I had no idea this was a thing. A couple Google searches for these products confirmed it.

Obviously, I'm not going to recommend this to any patients, but it has my curiosity piqued. 

I'm guessing the active ingredients are the same as RX antibiotics (cephalexin monohydreate). Are they held to the same manufacturing standards? Makes me wonder if there really is much of a difference.

medicine,"""Why can't YOU call my insurance? "" What's the best response?","I'm a Medical Assistant that works in a Ob/Gyn office, specifically with Uro/Gyn. I really do love my job, I get to interact with all kinds of people. Both patients and medical providers.

But I can't count how many times I get asked the question in the title. Many of our doctor's will order urodynamics testing for their patients with a variety of urology concerns, but most of the patients have absolutely no idea what it is or the fact that it is a rather expensive and time consuming procedure. 

We do provide education, handouts and online resources for them, but it can still be hard to grasp without experiencing it.

Whenever the provider I'm working for any particular day orders this procedure, I always tell the patient to call their insurance to check to see how it will be covered. They're provided CPT and ICD codes and a paper explaining the name of the test to ask about. Most insurances don't require a PA, but we want the patient aware of what their out of pocket cost is likely to be before they go through with the test. I mean, I know I'd appreciate a heads up if I'm going to meet my entire deductible in one afternoon. Right? 

Far too often, I have patients who seem aggravated that I don't personally  (or even have a designated person in our office ) call their insurance to ask about coverage. I try to explain that they themselves will need to hear about their expected out of pocket, not me. And that the company is more willing to talk to the member about these things, I could get a completely different answer, etc.

I don't even begin trying to explain that we have at least 3 dozen patients needing this procedure every week, and that every phone call usually takes about 30 minutes just because of the time on hold and we just don't have the manpower.

What would a good response be? How can I professionally and politely explain to patients that I don't have time to do something for them and they're given all the tools to do it?

medicine,Advice on dealing with my supervisor now,"I (EM intern) have an ~11 month old son who on Saturday, had his first ever ""breath holding spell"" after a huge meltdown, and passed totally out.  My wife absolutely freaked out and so did I, and we called 911.  All my training went right out the window when holding his limp body.  In all my time as a paramedic, I never, ever once came across a ""breath holding spell"".  To me it looked like many other times when a Ped went unconscious.  

He did come around very quickly, but the local Medics were there in ~2 min and took him to the ER where I work, and I rode with them.  After being checked out by the Pediatrician, he told us this is common, and that is was a breath holding spell.  

My supervisor shortly thereafter said to me ""You know if would spend more time learning and less time playing Mr Mom, you would have known what this was and saved yourself a lot of trouble"".  

My wife heard the comment, flew off the handle, made a bad scene, and said some really, *really* nasty things to her.  Like far below the belt.    

I start work at 4pm, and I am thinking on how to deal with this.  Head on? Pretend it never happened?  Advice is appreciated.  

**EDIT**: Some confused about the terminology of ""Supervisor"", here is more clarification because our system is apparently quite different:

Since the establishment of ""bypass"" procedures for our ER, there is a dedicated STEMI suite, stroke/neurovascular suite, and individual Level 1 trauma room staffed by surgeons and anesthesiologists, the interns and residents saw far, far fewer life-threatening and challenging cases.  

Once a local Medical school pulled their student rotations for a year because students barely saw anything notable, the powers that be instituted a system where a resident doing very well in PGY2 or beginning their PGY3 takes on 2 interns and literally ""supervises"" them - the *literal* definition of the word.  Our ""supervisor"" works with us to plan the day, and where and what specialty suite we will rotate into beyond our time in the ""traditional"" ER.  

It gives us a bit of a buffer from the hardened residents and attendings, majorly reduced senior residents' workloads, and gave the junior residents more teaching experience.",66,58,2015-09-21,PHARMA,0.12372247129678726,0.8527824878692627,0.02349502593278885

medicine,PharmD thinking of a career switch...,"Hello Everyone,

(I hope I'm not breaking any rules, I didn't think that pre-med would be a place that my questions could be answered as many of the questions I have are to you already practicing)

Background:


As the title suggests, I am a current PharmD who is really not satisfied with my job. I've recently finished a PGY1 pharmacy residency and thought that I would get more out of my career, but I really haven't. During residency I frequently thought about going back to medical school, or even PA school. What made me really think about it was how much I enjoyed my time on rotation at a VA as a student in the general medicine clinic. If you aren't familiar with how VAs work, PharmDs are able to prescribe and see patients very much like a PA/MD/NP does. Unfortunately, jobs are just not available for PharmDs to do this and the jobs that are open are generally subsidized for by colleges of pharmacy and are on limited contracts. Also, my residency was much more focused on inpatient pharmacy work which makes it very difficult for me to transition.


Now my main issue:

The main barrier is I'm about ~160k in debt from undergrad/pharmacy school. I would like to pay some (hopefully, most) of the money back before I would start. I'm currently 26, the earliest I could see myself entering any schooling would be 29 or 30. I am wondering if it would really be financially reasonable to do medical school (~160k+ near me) or if I would be better suited doing PA school (~60k near me). Not that I'm trying to make the main issue about money (I would make much more just staying a pharmacist) but school is expensive and I don't want to ruin my personal finances either.  My second main issue is that I would be much older starting my career as a physician and I feel like I may really disrupt a lot of my personal life.

My last (smaller) issue that I have is that I know at my age I would have no problem being a PA, but I'm not sure how I would feel about it as I get older (inevitably following order from someone half of my age). This isn't a deal breaker, but definitely something I've considered. 


So, to get to my questions:

Has anyone went to medical school later in life and wished you would have become a mid-level? Was it very taxing on your personal life?

Is any of the above financially reasonable? I'm asking for this because I'm not too aware of salaries for residencies or any other programs available for paying back loans.


Any other opinions that you would like to share?

* http://www.quickicd10.com  You can search any ICD 9 or 10 codes, find similar codes, and save them as favorites and export them as a pdf, etc.  

* http://quickicd10.com/index.php?cheatsheet=1  You can bulk convert a list of ICD-9 codes to ICD-10 and export them as a pdf or csv file.  

* http://www.nthtechnologies.net/mobile-apps.html#quickicd10  We made a mobile app which basically lets you do the same as the web app, just natively for iOS or Android.  

We always welcome feedback and hope these help!  If any mods have any issues with this, let me know.

medicine,Should the SO go to pre-interview dinners when invited?,"This is a follow up post I did a few days ago. My wife is hoping to go into Psych and there are a few invitations that she has been given that says that her spouse is invited.

The initial post got very mixed answers with some people saying flat out not to go and others saying just relax and be polite and it may help.

We have a young child that we will not be bringing to the dinners, but who does require that she have time to pump so just not bringing it up is not really a choice for us.

Also the programs are very spaced out, the one that will happen first is in Rochester NY.

Question: If the SO of a prospect is invited to the pre-interview dinner, should they attend or abstain? [&amp; why]

It will host a range of public lectures and activities to encourage dialogue and collaborative research across these disciplines.","With the generous support of the Peter Sowerby Foundation, King’s College London has launched *Philosophy &amp; Medicine*, a joint venture between King’s Department of Philosophy, School of Life Sciences and Medicine, and Florence Nightingale School of Nursing, whereby courses of study in philosophy will be introduced into the curricula that train clinicians.

Additionally, King’s will host a range of public lectures and activities to encourage dialogue and collaborative research across these disciplines.

The Department of Philosophy hosts Professor Sherrilyn Roush, the Peter Sowerby Chair in Philosophy &amp; Medicine. Professor Roush is developing connections between medicine and her ground-breaking contributions in central areas of philosophy, notably philosophy of science and epistemology.

David Aspinall, Chair of the Trustees of the Peter Sowerby Foundation, said: ""Medics and philosophers confront many of the same great issues—life and death, body and mind, knowledge and judgement—but too rarely engage with each other.” 

""We are delighted that today the Peter Sowerby Chair in Philosophy &amp; Medicine takes forward an extensive programme of thought-provoking activities across King's. The Trustees hope that the next generation of health professionals will engage in philosophical debate and therb y enrich their understanding of patient care and technological advancement.""

The King’s Colloquium in Philosophy and Medicine will begin on 1 October with a public lecture by David Beard, Professor of Musculoskeletal Sciences, Oxford, who will speak on “Placebo-controlled Surgical Trials”.

MS2 here.  Many of my classmates and I are conflicted over how much emphasis there is on extremely rare diseases during our preclinical education.

Or is medical school largely just an exercise is time and content management?  I think what I'm really getting at is this: do great clinicians emerge from medical students who learns their stuff, but don't sweat the tiniest of details, who gets through school by putting in the necessary hours but don't kill themselves over knowing everything, who are willing to give up 10% of their grade to have 10% more life?
