medicine,Neurosurgeons out there... when IS it the shunt?,"Peds PGY3, asking for a friend.

Happens  all the time when a kid with a VP shunt gets a fever. Then nurses,  fellows and attendings on the ward up in arms. They badger the intern to page page page neurosurgery to ask if it's a shunt infection,  ask if they can tap it, ask if they can reset the shunt, ask if they  should get a shunt series or MRI, ask to reset the shunt after the MRI,  and maybeee tap it juuuust one more time since fevers are still  happening.

Honestly in this situation it can feel like the neurosurgeon is protecting the poor kid from the primary team, but when is it actually the shunt and how can I  best communicate with you when it's real?

pharmacy,Written up for not meeting flu shot goals,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I am a PIC for Come Visit Satan in what is considered a low-volume store and have been for 3 years now. Pretty sure our store has never hit our goal before and during my time there. 
Right now we are bottom 30% in the district in flu shots. I have done 4x the number of flu clinics compared to last year, we’ve already passed the total number we did last year and it’s only November but would still have to pull out a very unreasonable number (about 3x what we are doing per day) every single day until 12/31. 

My boss called and said they were giving me a Level 1 write up for not being where we need to be with our goal year-to-date. I am freaking out. I’ve never heard of a pharmacist getting written up for fucking flu shot goals. 
Other than our flu shot issues, my store runs just fine. We are usually middle of the district in scores.

medicine,"Help: locked nursing homes keep dumping their ""difficult patients"" in our hospital -- What can be done?","I keep seeing this scenario play over and over in my hospital.  An elderly demented patient gets sent from their locked nursing home for an episode of agitation related to sundowning or delirium from a UTI, etc.  The patient gets admitted for a medical work up.  I might adjust their psych meds over the course of a few days.  The patient improves, stays calm, and is no longer requiring a 1:1 sitter.  Then the social worker tells us the nursing home refuses to take the patient back because of bad behavior! Then the patient stays in the hospital for another 2-3 months because they get blacklisted.  Isn't this illegal?  Shouldn't locked nursing homes be places most equipped to care for these patients?  What can be done about this problem?  Please share your experience and advice.

medicine,Bill Maher had Jenny McCarthy's pediatrician on his show and it was absolutely infuriating to watch.,"In my opinion, Bill Maher's whole shtick that makes him stand out among other late night shows is that he focuses so much on calling out stupidity whether it's climate change skeptics, religious zealots, racism, or pandering politicians. That being said though, he made a complete fool of himself by agreeing with every single point brought up by an anti-vax ""doctor"" he had on his show. Basically the main points Maher made were as follows:

1. ""There are a lot of dumb doctors. Sometimes I know more than them""

2. Big Pharma

3. The doctors are always telling me ""When have we been wrong?"" (no one ever says this) 

3. They told us that trans fat was good for us

4. The NYT told me that we just discovered a new organ 1.5 years ago (not true and very misleading). I read that they don't know how anesthesia works (partially true but pretty misleading). If we don't even know any of that then how can I trust vaccines?

5. I'm not saying I'm antivax. I'm just saying the doses and spacing aren't right. Also it probably does cause autism because I keep hearing stories about it

6. The ""doctor"" says he doesn't like new California laws restricting vaccine exemptions. The audience doesn't clap and Maher calls them sheep 

7. He also allegedly ""got the flu from the flu shot"" so he's against that one too.

The concept of vaccines keeps getting beaten like a dead horse. I always felt like the ones who don't agree with vaccines were stuck in echo chambers, the ones more susceptible to misinformation, and random dumbass celebrities like Jessica Biel, Jim Carry, or that one guy who used to host The Apprentice. It's frustrating to see someone who hosts a late night show and has considerable influence over people spouting this bullshit.

medicine,Useful Improvements At Your Clinic,"Wanted to get some ideas from individuals here about any useful improvements you or your clinic has done to make your work life easier. The ones I've done are the following:

- Purchased a mouse with programmable buttons (Logitech G602) and linked each button to shortcut keys for Epic EHR usage (ex. clicking ""x"" button brings me to the Rooming tab, clicking another brings me to Results Review) instead of having to use the keyboard or mouse/touchpad.

- Using a high resolution monitor or laptop for more real estate, which means less scrolling on Epic, thus the ability to see more + chart quicker. For example, you'll be able to see the Medications &amp; Orders, Diagnoses, and Progress Notes all on one screen.

- Using a remote desktop service to control your desktop from your laptop (ask your IT about this). This is useful if you're bringing your laptop into each patient's room and then using your desktop when you're back in your office; you'll be on the same screen as the laptop and you won't be kicked out of Epic after being inactive for x time. Also, my clinic for whatever reason doesn't let you sign orders directly from the laptop to print out (likely an IT issue), but this way allows you to sign off in the patient's room since you're actually using the desktop. You also won't have to deal with those Epic issues where it tells you it's ""read-only"" because you'll only be using one account instead of being logged on twice.

- Creating fillable PDF forms for front desk to use, quicker way to fill out things like work notes, certificate of medical necessity, etc.

- Purchased an inexpensive mesh Wi-Fi system (Google) for patient usage.",29,52,2019-11-03,PHARMA,0.025867963209748268,0.9321543574333191,0.041977718472480774

medicine,Which one: self-care or patient-care?,"I was revisiting the officially sanctioned SJT questions while prepping for a teaching session for med students and stumbled upon this:

&gt;You are working on a busy paediatric ward. Your shift was meant to finish at 7pm, but it is now 9pm on a Friday, and you are still trying to complete some of your routine tasks from the day. This has happened on a number of occasions in the last month and you feel exhausted as a result. Your workload is also having a negative impact on your social life. 


&gt;Rank in order the importance of the following considerations:
&gt;A. The impact on your own wellbeing if you are not able to take time to rest
&gt;B. The risk to patient safety if working whilst tired
&gt;C. Your right to finish at the designated time
&gt;D. That your consultant may give you a poor reference if you are not completing your tasks
&gt;E. That you are repeatedly disappointing your friends by not attending social events with them

&gt;Ans: BACDE

&gt;This scenario is about maintaining a good work life balance to work effectively and provide good patient care. As a doctor, the care of the patient is your main concern (B). Your own health has to be looked after in order to provide good patient care (A).

I don't know what or why but that's bugging me somewhat. To clarify, the question is not asking whether we should simply leave at 7pm and go home, but rather what has to be our *first* consideration.


Of course, A leads to B, but why is the patient our main priority? Yes - they are absolutely important, and they definitely are one of the priorities, but why can't we openly acknowledge that we are humans too. Is it not the ethos of a doctor, a nurse, a physio, a pharmacist etc etc to accept that we, as individuals, come before patients? Can we not put ourselves first, and then think about the patient? We're seeing increases in healthcare professionals with mental illnesses, and suicides/self-harm across all grades. No one (save firefighters) would be expected to jump into a fire to save a human, and yet why are we expected to become patients before we put us as first, even in an exam?

A local high school had some sort of overnight event. In the course of 2 hours, ambulances were contacted for 6 students for similar symptoms. Severe headache, emotional duress, agnor animi, and nausea.  Ambulances ended up being deferred, and school staff + community first responders transported all 6 students to our clinic. A 7th patient, a teacher, came soon thereafter. 

Ensuring to cover all of our bases, we made sure to work up each patient as an individual case. Only one patient set off our triage alarm bells (photophobia, stiff neck, crisis level hypertension). That patient ended up having a subarachnoid hemorrhage confirmed via CT and was brought via critical care ambulance to a neurosurgical hospital. 

Everyone else ended up having symptoms resolve after an hour of being seperated, placed into observation, given low dose anxiety medication, and reassured only one person had an issue and that was non-contagious.

medicine,How to handle fire drills?,"TL;DR: How do you handle unexpected fire drills when you are in the middle of regular patient appointments? 

Context: I work a group of other mental health professionals. The building we work was zoned into a city which handles fire drills differently, and is much more strict. We no longer get any sort of heads up when a drill is coming, so we might be in with a patient when this happens (as happened with my colleague today). On the one hand, we don't have anyone dressed in a paper gown or in the middle of having a cyst removed, etc.! On the other, we are often in the middle of conversations that are not easily and quickly paused (e.g trauma work, assessing suicidality/safety). If a patient has to leave, who pays for the appointment? Billing insurance would be fraud, but it's unfair to both the patient and to the provider. 

I figure that this process has to have some sort of leeway for a medical office, so I'm wondering how your offices handle it?

pharmacy,THANK YOU from an ADHD teen!,"(Well, I’m not a teen anymore, but...)

I’ve been reading a lot of healthcare subreddits this week as a procrastination technique and I just wanted to stop in to thank y’all. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 15 and I had to navigate my first prescription fill entirely by myself (sick parent &amp; doctor was on vacation iirc). There’s always that irony of “you need your ADHD meds to organize your shit to get your ADHD meds” — all the more so for a kid who had no knowledge of pre-auths, generics, what a reasonable price was (did I dare call my mom to see if we could afford $68? idk I’m in tenth grade!), etc. It didn’t help that my doctor wanted me to start with Focalin, which (seemingly) isn’t stocked &amp; covered at the rate of Adderall &amp; Ritalin. 

I went to an independent pharmacy on the UWS and the pharmacist SAVED MY SANITY. I don’t remember all the twists and turns, but I think my insurance covered the IR but not the XR or something silly — all I remember is that when the pharmacist said “you’re gonna need to call your insurance and your doctor” I had a reaction of sheer panic and he took such mercy on me. There were a bunch of people in line behind me, so he wrote down what I need to ask on a post-it and grabbed me a folding chair so I could start making phone calls. I must’ve been there four times in the span of a week while we got my doctor’s input from across the world, gave Concerta a shot, fought with insurance (or maybe the state regulations?) when they wouldn’t keep filling stuff bc I was changing doses too often or going back and forth too many times or whatever it was, tried a few partial fills, and finally got me my prized bottles of XR &amp; IR for what he assured me was a reasonable price. One of the times I was there was near closing; he stuck around once all the customers were gone and explained the basics of how to navigate this system. 

He never treated me like an idiot kid who just wanted stimulants for funsies, and he advocated for me as if he was trying to get me some kind of life-saving drug. He saved me a bunch of back-and-forth trips. He always stocked Focalin bc he knew I’d keep coming back. I moved to Chicago for college; he recognized me one summer after I hadn’t been there in two years. 

Ten years later I  get stressed af when I have to fill a new prescription at a new pharmacy/with new insurance (going unmedicated for 3 months and then trying to fill Vyvanse at an understaffed CVS with brand-new, shitty insurance and a hard-to-reach doctor... folks, it’s not great), but at least I have a basic understanding of the system and from the very beginning saw proof that it could be figured out. That first week was panic-inducing and if not for his support I might’ve given up. So, THANK YOU. I’ve had many more great pharmacists since (and some very overworked ones w/o time for my bullshit) and I’ve gotten tons of invaluable guidance through a confusing system, but he’s the one who taught me the questions to ask and the info to carry and so forth, so he gets top billing in my book. 

Your work is very much appreciated by this disorganized gal, and I’m sure by many many more of my kind!",2,57,2019-11-06,PHARMA,0.06560782343149185,0.900520920753479,0.03387131169438362

I work at an outpatient behavioral health office that is still on paper. I hate paper and worked in detox as an RN prior to becoming a CNP. I've heard all the horror stories of diversion and felt like it was easy enough to call in my own scripts if paper scripts were the alternative.

My employer had printed off prescription pads prior to my credentialing. I never used them, so there are hundreds in our CEO's office. My NPI and DEA numbers are printed on those scripts. I am also a MAT provider, so it's easy to infer what my xDEA is from that info.

One of the scripts my colleague wrote was flagged by a pharmacy because she wrote just her name on the script. The script went through and the patient had been receiving medication under my name. I found out my coworker had been using my Rx pad for months. I had NO idea. Someone accessed them from the CEO's office for her since she ran out of her own pads.

In Ohio, NPs have to collaborate with a physician -- we are not independent practice. My collaborating physician and I agreed on the steps I took next: (1) Informed BON (2) Informed Board of Pharmacy (3) Informed DEA (4) Filed police report per DEA

I see a whole lot of jaded pharmacists posting about how you won’t even be considered for a hospital job until you’ve completed residency and have your BCPS.

I graduated in late 2017. 
I had zero practical hospital experience upon graduating outside of rotations, BUT I made a really good impression on all of the staff and the chief of pharmacy at one of my hospital rotations and despite having zero paid hospital experience, no residency, no BCPS, no experience even as a pharmacist yet, they contacted me after I graduated and asked if I would be interested in an inpatient position. Granted I had to commute an hour to the middle of nowhere everyday for this job, but after a year and a half, I was offered a job at a hospital in a city with a metro population of almost 8 million.

Now that I work in a major hospital where most of the support staff are minorities and degreed professionals are white, I am constantly getting surprised look once they find out I am a degreed professional as well.  IDK if its because they don't believe minorities can get to positions that equal/surpass their own or they are just that naive and just believe minorities are relegated to just support/kitchen/maintenance roles, smh. 

Newsflash: Its 2019. There are minority physicians, dentists, pharmacist, lawyers, engineers, etc. I hate to have to make a post like this in this forum, but some of the aforementioned looks/questions have come from fellow pharmacist as well.

medicine,Butterfly IQ ultrasound protective case,"This might be a bit niche, but for anyone who wants a way to protect their new ultrasound, I think i've figured out a reasonable solution for a protective case that will fit in your white coat pocket. I have no idea why butterfly wouldn't have thought that we would want a simple way to protect a $2k piece of equipment in our white coat pocket (sorry but the belt clip isn't a great solution) but I did some digging. If you look online, you see some EM ppl have videos using those large protective cases you have to hand carry. Nobody has suggestions for something that can fit in your pocket.

So I found a portable speaker case that almost perfectly fits the dimensions. You might want a little bit of foam to support the end perfectly but it will fit if you lay it so that the edge of the cable coming out of the ultrasound will rest close to the zipper as it loops around but this doesn't put stress on the end. I usually won't zip the case all the way (just up to where the cord comes close to the zipper) in order to minimize any stress it may put on the cord. It's still zipped like 90% of the way and i just put it in my pocket, probe head down and haven't had any issues with it unzipping or anything. It feels very snug and secure and the case feels like it'll protect it a good bit from random bumps into walls/white coat falling to the floor etc.

It takes up a little more room than the ultrasound itself in your pocket so if the ultrasound fit, imagine a little more bulk and thats how the ultrasound in teh case will feel.

The link is below. The amazon link has several options most of which are different colors but the last one is a rectangular shape which doesn't fit as well and is bulkier. Get the elongated one (dimensions are 7.5x2x3 inches). I've tested a bunch of cases and this was the best by far. Haven't found any that will perfectly fit the entire device and are reasonably sized to fit in your pocket.

Hope this helps.

medicine,What are your patient pet peeves and how have you worked through them?,"Junior Doctor here on internal medicine rotation.

I was in a very busy ED on nights this week and maybe it was just the lack of sleep but found myself getting really irritated by the following things:

\- Patient comes in and is really unwell, I tell patient she has to stay in and then the husband (and to a degree the patient also) get really annoyed that I'm telling them she has to stay in for IV antibiotics, blood transfusion etc and it's in her best interest she does this.  Similar scenario with a few patients over the set of nights.  I don't understand, if you think you are sick enough to come into hospital, there is a chance we might want to keep you in.  Why are patients shocked when we tell them this? It's like they expect us to magically fix them in 5 mins and send them home.

\- Conversely it's the patients that are absolutely fine and can be sent home with some advice of self care who scream at me that they want to be admitted.

\-When asking for a drug history. PATIENT: ""I take the little yellow pill in the morning"",

ME: do you know what this is called?  Do you have a list of your medications with you?PATIENT: ""No, don't you know what the little yellow pill is call? You should know you're a doctor.""ME: :/

It would just be common sense to me that if you have a million things wrong and take a ton of pills you might bring a copy of you drug history in with you to the hospital.  Especially patients who have a spouse or someone with them to help with that when coming into hospital.

\- Patients lying to me on direct questioning when I know they have a history of drug use etc.

What are your patient pet peeves, how have you worked through them?  I'm not normally this aggy about patients but finding myself particularly irritable and burned out this week.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: It annoys me how when a patient makes a complaint early on, even if it is completely unfounded, then the management go out of their way to go way above and beyond to make sure they don't complain again.  We end up spending so much time appeasing the patient and their family, and to be honest I think the other patients suffer because we are spending unequal time with this one patient.  I feel like at the end of the day if they are going to complain then they are going to complain, can't stop them.  I once had to tell a family member that I couldn't talk to him again as he demanded 3 updates a day with the doctors.  I have to kindly and politely explain that by talking to him for 15 mins 3 times a day, my time was being taken away from the medical care of his father and the other patients on the ward. I could be spending my time, ordering and interpreting tests, diagnosing managing etc, instead of spending over an hour talking with him.  I think he finally understood but kept asking me for multiple updates so had to reiterate again the message the next day.

medicine,The quality of food at a local nursing home. Should I call the state to inspect?,"I am a dietitian at an cancer treatment center who has worked inpatient as well, and I often feel sorry for the majority of patients coming from a nursing home. Of course, my career is focused on food, and this is a HUGE quality of life thing when it's the only thing the person has to 'look forward to'.

I have a wheelchair-bound patient coming to my cancer center who was begging me to call her nursing home and talk to them about her ""diet"". She is from India, does not eat pork and is diabetic (as well as suffering from chemo-related issues). She has no family.

She claims they serve her vegetables straight from the can, cold, directly on her plate with no spices or flavors, or ""fruit cocktails"" packed in syrup. She says the food is inedible.

When I called the facility, I asked to speak to a dietitian. The nursing home staff member said the dietitian only comes once per month.  They did not provide her contact information. The ""food service director"" told me the patient was placed on a no added salt diet, so they refused to give her ""salt or pepper"". When I asked why she could not have pepper, they did not have an answer. When I asked why the food was served cold, she told me the patient could request the nurse to microwave the food. When I asked if there are alternative options in the menu, she said the patient could choose from items including ""Bologna sandwich"". Which I was flabbergasted by, since she does not eat pork and is on a ""no added salt diet"". I must mention every other option was a cold food item, such as cottage cheese, salad, or tuna sandwich. This leads me to believe they do not serve any hot meals whatsoever.

It is clear that quality of life and basic enjoyment is not a priority at this, or many, LTC facilities. It's all about providing the bare minimum, cheapest treatment including sub-par, worse than prison quality food. I wouldn't feed it to my dog. I wouldn't eat it. Would you?

medicine,Do these licensure questions on mental illness sound reasonable to you?,"I'm a premed and some friends and I are interested in organizing a group of med students/faculty to appeal to change questions in our state's (AL) licensure application that currently violate the ADA. I saw [this publication](http://jaapl.org/content/46/4/458) that shows AL to be in violaton of the ADA, but the new application has since changed. Could I get a gauge from current med students/residents/physicians on the current questions? I emailed some folks who can comment on whether they're still in violation of the ADA, but I'm curious to know if current HCP still think they are unreasonable. Thanks!

pharmacy,CVS - impossible to find common names at the register now,"The last register update this week has made it impossible to find a ""common"" name now. For example, if you have about a page of John Smiths, that patient cannot be found on the register anymore through normal means. You can type the full name and still nothing. The newer registers will bounce you back with a default offline mode, and the older registers will basically tell you the search criteria is not enough.

There are two work arounds. One is to re verify the prescription as a waiter and hit waiter at the register and find the patient. The other is to change the patient's name on the computer system and search that new name. So the patient becomes John zzz.

What bothers me is that since this is CVS, the moment they make a problem or glitch, you don't get extra tech hours to supplement a ""known"" issue, but the moment they fix this issue, you get more hours cut. It's a vicious cycle. What improvements has the company made to make our system more efficient? Numeric waiting bin and new phone system theoretically should cut 5 hours of labor a week. But I feel as if lost meds make me spend more time just looking for the lost meds doesn't help much. The phone system hasn't decreased any phone calls at all. So the difference between this year and last year for me has been a 10% tech hour cut. I'm about ready to throw in the towel. The only company that I've seen that doesn't cut hours after a efficiency improvement is rite aid. They take pharmacist input and improve the system and what do you know? My hours still stay the same!

medicine,I'm just a volunteer - I saw my first dead patient today. Any processing techniques?,"Hello,

I'm so sorry in advance if this isn't the right place for this.  I'm a volunteer in the PICU - I've been volunteering for two years but I'm not a medical professional by any stretch of the imagination.  I know that patients die on the unit.  It's always super low key, and usually I don't know until after the fact.  Before today, I had never seen a dead body.

Today, a patient died about twenty minutes into my volunteer shift.  Their nurse was talking about how matted their hair was, as it had been a few months since it had been properly combed.  I cautiously asked if I could help (not really thinking that the nurse would say yes) and the nurse said that would be very appreciated.  So I helped to comb the knots out of this dead patient's hair for about an hour and a half.  The patient was young.  I have a young child of my own.  I was fine in the room but ever since I got home I've been having a lot of difficulty processing what happened today.  

I'm just a volunteer; I have no real training on how to handle this.  What are some ways to process this patient's death, and my own reaction to it?  I've been volunteering for two years and this has never happened before, so I don't expect to get a lot of exposure to dead kids in the future, but I would sincerely appreciate any advice on how to deal with and compartmentalize this event.

medicine,Managing sickle cell pain - maintenance vs emergent,"I’m an intern and hoped to hear some thoughts on pain management in sickle cell patients. Even seasoned attendings in both the ED and heme worlds seem frustrated. I don’t want patients to be in pain....but it’s difficult to manage, particularly when home med regimens have patients on such high levels of opioids.

Case in point: a young patient with confirmed SS presented to the ED recently. They had a young child with them (relevant later). This patient presents to the ED once a month when their pain meds that are prescribed by their hematologist run out. I want to believe the patient’s report of their level of pain, but this patient was wandering the department, on their phone...made me a bit hesitant to write for the amount of dilaudid they were requesting. Regardless - we provided the max amount of pain meds we thought safe in a patient refusing admission. We offered admission with a PCA but they refused. We offered 4mg of IV dilaudid then 6mg 2.5hrs later which they said did nothing....which I believe since they’re on such high doses of opiates at baseline. Their hematologist has them on 927 morphine equivalents A DAY. (Confirmed via her opioid registry report) Every 30 DAYS they’re given 360 pills of 30mg oxycodone, 180 pills of 8mg hydromorphone, and 60 pills of 40mg oxymorphone. We even got the doc on the phone at 4am...and all he would say was “I can vouch for her that she is on very high doses of opioids, so she’s going to need more than most.” We were willing to go up on the dosing for this acute session, but the patient wasn’t willing to stay longer that 20min after getting a dose. We thought it was especially important that we monitor them since they had a small child with them. Even though we know the amount of opioids they are prescribed as an outpatient, we had no way of knowing if the patient truly takes that much at home.

My questions:

1) Is it appropriate for a hematologist to prescribe the levels of pain meds this doc is?

2) In a patient on as much home opioids as this patient, what dosing would you be comfortable discharging them with vs having them admitted?

3) What is the most appropriate way to manage patients with sickle cell pain in the acute vs chronic? (As in what specific dosing/frequency would you offer a patient like this?)",59,88,2019-11-17,PHARMA,0.12462981045246124,0.8463771343231201,0.02899300679564476

medicine,Viable self managed clinic - A question for Indian Doctors,"Hi everyone, I am a mbbs doctor from India. I am tired of trying to crack neet pg. I don't have resources to invest in a huge hospital. I did my medicine from a good medical college and was doing freelance work as medical officer in a few software companies while studying for neetpg. The exam is crap and has zero use in daily clinical practice and unless you are okay with mindlessly mugging up mcqs, the chances of getting into a decent field is very small.

So after wasting 4 years, I decided to start a clinic. 100% self managed in a poor area. I didn't do mbbs to get rich, I can live by if I can get bare minimum provided there is some scope for growth. So here are the questions I have right now.

1. Is it possible to manage a clinic solely by yourself? I am thinking to buy medications wholesale from pharma rep and give them to the patient directly(everything included in my consultation fee). Is there an upper limit on the total amount of medications a doctor can have at a time?
2. I want to charge the patient based on the disease they have upfront on the first visit, which includes the blood tests and medication. Subsequent visits would be free and the patient will just have to pay just for extra medications they receive the next time, or else they can even purchase them outside also as I will be writing generic medications mostly. Would this help decrease financial load on the patient?
3. Should I keep a tie-up with a lab or invest in my own lab and get a lab technician involved? Diagnostics are unnecessarily costly and I would love to cut the middle men especially for basic investigations. Will this be a viable option since most of my work would be primary care and basic investigations like cbp, platelet count, cue, grbs?
4. The market is flooded with the RMP scum, the rural medical practitioners who are supposed to work in villages have Monopoly at the primary level even in urban cities. Most of these people survive on fee splitting with bigger hospitals by referring patients to them. They take a percentage of the bill paid by the patient to the bigger hospital. How can I effectively get this money back to the patient without taking my cut or acting like a whistleblower?

Please let me know if you have any queries or suggestions. I just want to give back to the society for making me a good doctor. I love reading clinical medicine and treating patients. I feel it would be a great injustice to this Noble field if I wasted my time not practicing medicine or become a puppet for the corporate overlords. Please give me your suggestions on this. Thanks.",31,113,2019-11-19,PHARMA,0.033944692462682724,0.930975615978241,0.03507969155907631

medicine,Would you be willing to treat a patient who saw you as a moral monster for treating them?,"I recently read [this article](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/5/15/1857976/--The-Only-Moral-Abortion-is-My-Abortion-an-article-by-Joyce-Arthur) and quite frankly, I found it really disturbing. It deals with with women who are opposed to abortion but become pregnant and decide to have one.

Now, I should probably point out right away that the actual morality of abortions is not what concerns me here. What I found so shocking was the attitude of (some of) the women described. It mentions women who were willing to flat out call their treating physicians **murderers** for doing a procedure they themselves are **requesting**.

It's worth noting that this particular issue might be somewhat of a (relative) blindspot for me, as I am not in ob/gyn and abortion is not even remotely on the political radar in my country. I have literally never heard even a single politician, on any level, ever raise the issue. But like I said, the actual abortions are not the core of the issue for me here. I have never been in a position where I have had to refuse a patient, but I simply cannot imagine treating someone who would see me as a monster (and was apparently willing to say that to my face), much less if they raised the stakes to seeing me as a murderer (and not even in some metaphorical sense!) and even less so if it was for a procedure they were willingly requesting of me! Plus, in some of the stories that are described, they were making life more difficult for not just the medical staf, but also other patients. To me, that just isn't acceptable.

What do you guys think?

PS: I hope this goes without saying, but obviously I am not talking about urgent medical care, nor about detailed explorations of a patients ethics for just any procedure.

medicine,Physicians - Reasons why you don't have a scribe,"So I've been scribing for over a year now and recently ran a report on total patients/month comparing before and after having a scribe. He's able to see the same amount of patients in a 3 day work week compared to his previous 5 day work week without a scribe. You also have the added benefit of someone completing 99% of the charting/documentation for you, which knocks off significant time on your end. So I'm curious on any reasons why a scribe would not be helpful. Here are some of my thoughts below.

- Not needed for some specialties since you're addressing a few acute problems or the same common problems, which tends to be pretty quick to document especially with the charting tools EMRs have.
- You're picky with your documentation
- You know the bare minimum needed to meet billing, thus making you efficient enough on your own
- You're still using paper charts and don't mind the penalty

Other reasons from Redditors

- Being employed and not being able to decide this for myself
- Free labor from residents/fellows
- Efficient usage of EMR
- Restricted privileges for scribes (can't place/pend orders)
- High turnover rate for scribes
- Relying on scribes too heavily and forgetting how to use an EMR when the scribe has a day off
- Not worth the cost
- Live in Canada, really no need
- Work in a specialty where notes have another layer of security and having a scribe can negative affect treatment (e.g. psychiatry)",116,134,2019-11-21,PHARMA,0.05249842628836632,0.913372814655304,0.03412875160574913
medicine,Working relationships with NPs,"Where I work we've recently had a nurse practitioner join the clinic and I've found myself in an uncomfortable position. I'm finding myself answering clinical, administrative and EMR questions 10-15+ a day and it is impeding my workflow. I am fee-for-service like most family physicians here, so between my 50 patients a day and endless paperwork I don't exactly have the time to do free hallway consults all day.

These nurse practitioners were hired under new salaried positions to practice independently in community clinics and are functionally equivalent to a family physician. They are doing the same job as me. Of course, since they've never practiced in this scope or setting before they have oodles of questions both logistical and clinical in nature. There's no one available to answer their questions except family doctors.

I do admit there are some politics behind this as well. The local government came up with 2 salaried contracts, one for GPs and the other for NPs. Broken down per patient, the NPs are being paid 50% more than GPs which has caused a lot of tension. Family doctors were already feeling undervalued and overworked so this was just salt in the wound.

I am not sure how I should approach this while being professional about it. I don't exactly want to throw a colleague under the bus but it's affecting my work and ideologically it doesn't feel right that I am having to mentor this person.

This post was mostly prompted by /u/InvestingDoc’s [question last week]( https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/dvgdzd/drexelhahnemann_will_not_pay_for_residents_tail/f7cnpkm/) about whether or not the AMA had the back of those residents. The answer is that the AMA is providing more support than any individual doc anywhere, or any other group of physicians for that matter. 

It should be clarified that it is the volunteer physicians of the AMA that are providing that support. They did so by actually responding to the issue with actual effort and by maintaining the infrastructure for this sort of a response to be able to be organized. The volunteers thought it appropriate to provide immediate relocation relief, and are continuing to work on multiple other issues that docs on reddit haven’t found the time to complain about yet, including immigration or policy issues. As a policy advocacy group, personally I think this is an appropriate response. 

To the last point about whether or not AMA funds should be used to provide tail coverage? **I encourage everyone who has an opinion to join the AMA and propose policy.

medicine,CPT Clarification (9940x),"Recently picked up part-time working weekends for a medical weight loss clinic as a provider. It's supposed to work like this: RN/MA brings them back, gets the patient weighed in and vitals, then off to a room. I pop in for 5-10 minutes, then the Registered Dietitian takes over and sees them for the rest of the appointment (30 min appts currently). My question revolves around the use of the templates they created, as it auto applies a preset ROS, PE, ICD codes and CPT codes. I adjust the ROS, PE and ICDs as necessary, but during the emr onboarding they said they wanted us to use 99402 for every visit. Per my understanding, that wouldn't qualify, as I'm not in the room for more than 22.5 minutes (unless they're really good at ""getting their thoughts out"" as I say). They said that it does, as we're providing care for more than 22.5 minutes under my supervision. I can't find a clear answer in writing if I'm correct or if they're correct.

&amp;#x200B;

medicine,"What sort of lifestyle can you achieve in your country as a doc, and does it live up to the dream?","I don't know if anyone remember Michael Moore's Sicko, in which he says how good the NHS is in the UK, because two GPs in London made it rich, and could afford a massive house.

His point was that socialism in medicine is not to be feared, because look there are still rich doctors!

It was always a bit of a funny point, and a bit off-putting if you were in the UK, paying taxes.

There is that stereotype that i've heard Indian trained doctors joke about, that their parents told them to be a doctor or an engineer to be rich and successful, the irony being they should have become a banker or work in IT.

So what is the actual lifestyle medicine gives you in your country, once you've finished training? And does it live up to the expectations, stereotypes or ideas of the general population about how doctors live? Is there a tension between expectations and reality to you (it's not as good as I thought!) and your patients (that doctor is so rich they don't understand me!)

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say in the UK if you complete your training, become a consultant (attending) or GP (family practice doctor), you'll be in the top 5% of income, and you can afford a large (4 bedroom) semi-detached house in a fairly nice area with good schools in the north or midlands, or maybe a 3 bed in the nicest suburbs or down south. In London you might be able to buy a flat (apartment) with a few bedrooms.

You can afford a few foreign holidays a year, a modest car. If you want to send your kids to private school you won't be able to take foreign holidays or have as nice a house.

So it's pretty comfortable upper-middle class life, but not particularly a life of luxury. Now the students are paying £9000 per year for tuition fees, they might not be as happy when they have £50,000 of debt to pay on top of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand in the USA it's more extreme, more pay but way more debt. But from what I've seen even in Oz and NZ the cost of living, particularly housing, seems very high, is medicine still seen as a good profession?

When he came back to get his medicines he approached the counter yelling ""am I allowed to come up to the counter like this?"" ""I said of course Sir, there's no one in front of you, ..."" Que the tirade.

Apparently it was offensive that as a female I told him where to stand, so he told me to shut the fuck up and that he was done talking to me now, and asked if I talked that way to my WIFE at home (saw the ring on my finger so randomly tried to make a gay insult?)

medicine,"EMR (EPIC) Nightmare, How is mid-level documentation handled in your practice","Our ED recently swapped from paper T-Sheets (good ol' days) to Epic. Among our numerous issues hospital-wide, the biggest problem in the ED has been mid-level charting. Currently every mid-level chart must have an attending manually assigned (by me) to a patient; at the end of the patient encounter (when I have signed the chart meaning no further changes will be made) it will show up in an attending's inbox with a ""cosign"" button that opens a new note that they must sign. If the patient is discharged however, the attending is removed from the treatment team and the chart goes un-cosigned forever. To make it more frustrating for physicians, anything I alter after the chart is co-signed must then be RE-CO-SIGNED. Surely this is not how every ED handles this stuff. Mayybe internal medicine, but still arduous.

If you have an alternate work-flow in your practice with Epic, please explain how your process works.

biotech,career options that exclude managerial positions,"In biotech, with a PhD, or also without, if one wants to make a career, it seems to me that the goal is always to become a manager. Maybe starting from a team lead, then a manager of a bigger group of people, etc.

However, management positions usually involve lots of administrative work and are more of sitting-in-an-office kind of jobs. Meanwhile, I would really like to pursue a career where I would continue to do science and not just document other people doing science.

Another aspect that I don't like about manager roles is that you are responsible for the work of other people. Meaning that you always need to teach, control, correct and teach again. It seems always easier to get things done by myself, other than asking somebody to do them for me. So I love having many tasks with high responsibility, but only when I can totally control the outcome, and don't need to rely on lazy or unmotivated co-workers. 

I wonder if there's anyone who sees the management positions with the same kind of negative ideas, and what could a possible desirable career path in biotech look like that excludes the above-mentioned annoying aspects. 

To make it clear, might be good to note that a desirable career path for me would still be with lots of responsibility, well paid and something where I'd feel that I'm making a good impact. So please don't recommend to just stay as a lab technician.",15,16,2019-11-30,PHARMA,0.040450774133205414,0.9199828505516052,0.03956632688641548
