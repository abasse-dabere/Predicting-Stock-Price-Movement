medicine,"""I am the CEO of this hospital, I own the charts, I can go into any chart I want to. I do not need Medical Staff permission""","That doesn't seem right to me.

Caveat: This is in a CAH and under the COP from CMS

I am under the impression to enter a chart, you have to have a need.  QA/QI counts, but that is under the delegated authority of med staff.  All patient care, i thought, was over seen by med staff.

They are doing chart reviews and investigations without including any of the med staff in the loop or decision making process.  The CEO says that they will only bring findings to med staff that directly impact the care given by a physician/mid level.  

My bitch started when i found out i gave my patient sepsis by ordering a bath and nobody told me where the infection came from, even after they had positive cultures.

pharmacy,I’m the floater everyone dreads coming to their store and I am in need of advice,"Hi, everyone. I’m a new floater with a chain pharmacy and have been having a lot of trouble. Mostly with keeping up with the pace. I always show up to my shifts at least 20 minutes early to get started on the queue and conquer the day, but within a couple hours without fail start having issues (long phone calls with patients asking about situations I’m not familiar with, insurance issues, a lot of waiters coming in) and fall super behind. Because I’m new, I also have a lot of anxiety about making a mistake and find myself checking my typing over, then still double checking while verifying, looking at the label, etc. A lot of the time, I also have little tech help or am working with a new tech so whenever there’s an insurance issue or anything like that I have to figure it out on my own which is tough and also takes a lot of time. I feel so embarrassed admitting it, but there’s been numerous nights where I’ve left 100+ things in the queue, and notes for the next day with insurance issues I couldn’t solve. I’m sure you can imagine what happens when I cover a full weekend at the same store. I always stay late, some nights even two extra hours, but don’t even make a dent. I feel so bad creating extra work for people and pretty much know everyone in my district dreads when they see me, but I don’t even know where to begin in trying to improve. Before this job, I had never worked for the company before. As a student, I worked at an independent, where they pretty much just had me count so I don’t even know where to start. It sounds sad, but the thought of insurance rejections alone (esp now that it’s flu season and extra busy) make me so nervous to go to work. Whenever there’s an issue I try to calmly explain to the patient I’m newer and will try my best to figure it out, but mostly end up getting yelled at 70% of the time, which throws me off my game even more. It’s all had me really down lately, and I worry I’m not cut out for the job or will eventually get fired. Any advice for me is really appreciated, thank you.",56,141,2018-10-04,PHARMA,0.21468886733055115,0.7533195614814758,0.03199160099029541

medicine,Primary Care Physicians in NP Independent practice states; what's it like?,"Hi everyone, 

3rd year medical student here. With Virginia recently having enacted a law for NP independent practice to begin soon, I was curious about what that would entail for the future. I was discussing this with my father (hospitalist) and he was very much telling me to avoid primary care and to pursue a fellowship if I were to do internal medicine. I was curious about what your thoughts are about the future of primary care practice and what that entails with regards to the future of primary care, specifically with regards to the scope of the physician.

Thanks,

medicine,Personal statement for a second level medicine fellowship.,"Hey everyone! I will be applying for a fellowship in cardiac electrophysiology, and sat down today to work on my personal statement. For internal medicine, it was sort of 50/50 with fluff/a personal story accounting for 50% and the other 50% talking about research and volunteerwork and such. For cardiology fellowship I toned down the fluff, and it was probably 30/70. Now, for EP fellowship I am leaning towards a 10/90 sort of split.

Talking about experiences from my childhood that led to medicine, sick patients in the CCU, etc just seems kind of silly for whatever reason. Right now I am basically just stating why electrophysiology is a good fit for me, talking about the research I have done, and outlining what I can bring to the table during EP fellowship.

The problem with this, is that it becomes a bit of a boring read. There seems to be little out there (at least that I could find) in terms of advice for personal statement writing at this level of training. Anyone here with experience/advice on the matter?

Edit: Just wanted to thank everyone for the advice here. Just finished up a pretty decent first draft, where I put a lot of focus on my current research and how I will continue and expand upon it in the future along with my career goals.

medicine,The common road to burnout,"As this sub is centered around those practicing medicine, I wanted to say that there are people out there willing to help you guys.  There's no need to repeat the same mistakes others have made. And talking to others is helpful, not weak.

&amp;#x200B;

In that vein, I've thought a lot about what the common story is that leads to burnout in attending physicians - which starts in training.  It commonly goes something like this:

1) Sacrifice your 20s for an altruistic profession hoping to help others - forcing you to miss birthdays, funerals, weddings, soccer games, recitals, parties, and reunions. 

2) Get accepted to residency and soon find out your hours are longer than anticipated and the respect is even shorter.

3) Get inundated with non-physician tasks, condescension, and overall poor moral.  Burnout starts.

4) Push through training with the hope that the light at the end of the tunnel  - becoming an attending physician - solves your burnout problem

5) Become an attending physician and realize that light at the end of the tunnel isn't as bright as you thought - Get hammered by administrators, insurance companies, and bureaucracy.  

6) Realize the burnout is still there and its a raging fire set to consume you.  You just aren't happy.

7)  Being unhappy, you buy into consumerism to try and make it better.  You buy the house, the cars, the private school education, the designer clothes and gadgets. All in an attempt to fill that void while inundated with student loans and consumer debt.

8) Career burnout continues.  Hopefully, it stops there.

&amp;#x200B;

There has to be something better than the above narrative.  There are people out there willing to help you.  And why I'll always be passionate about advocating for my residents and teaching them that there is a better way.  This is why I write.  And this is my purpose in writing about this, which has become my passion.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are struggling.  Realize, you aren't alone.  There are others struggling, too.  Don't accept the status quo and know that there are people out there trying to change the system.

If you are an academic attending physician or an administrator, I implore you to protect your residents and to show them there is a better way.

Greetings healthcare providers!

I'm a RPh and over the years of my studying in Pharmacy School and now at a Tertiary Hospital Pharmacy, I've wore varieties of Scrubs brands and I'm happy to share my experience of them based on my physical attributes (Male, 5'10, 220lbs overweight guy):

**Cherokee:** the Gap of scrubs, well known brand, traditional cuts that fits all types of bodies, with %35 cotton, their fabric is rough at first but soften up after each wash, had two scrubs from them back in 2013 and over a short period of time the pants sewing near the butt area started to break off, no plan to buy from it again, overpriced and the alternatives are cheaper and better in all aspects.

**Wonderwink:** traditional cuts and %35 cotton as well, their fabric is rough but lighter weight compared to the Cherokee, the design I got was with minimal pockets as it's designed to be worn with a lab coat, might buy from them again if my hospital enforced for me to wear my lab coat.

**Figs:** the Nike/Adidas/Under Armor etc of scubs, technical scrub sets with athletic fits, so it looks exceptionally amazing on a fit guy, fabric is a synthetic cocktail, most expensive scrub set I've ever bought, I look good wearing it below a lab coat and it's comfortable to wear with it, but ridiculous wearing it without the lab coat as it highlights my lovehandles, moobs and belly.

**Koi:** tailored fit scrubs with many pockets and unique styling, %55 cotton so the fabric is amazingly soft, fits my build perfectly and looks like it's tailored to me (I wear a size L), only disadvantage is that it's uncomfortable to wear below a lab coat, only scrub I got compliment on, definitely plan to buy a second one with the same design but different color.

pharmacy,"How to help my Pharmacist? As a patient. When you do well, you deserve to be recognized for it!","Sorry if this is the wrong area to ask, but I figured you'd have the best advice. I work in the medical field (though I'm not in pharmacy) so I appreciate and notice when someone is good at their job. I happen to LOVE my pharmacy team at my local Walgreens. After having some prior authorizations, insurance issues, phone tag with me and my physicians, a lot of work went into getting my scrip filled. Knowing how difficult many patients can be, typically only ever reporting negative experiences, how can I as a HAPPY consumer/patient help my Pharmacists and their Techs get the recognition they deserve? 

I asked my pharmacist and she said to complete the survey on the bottom of my receipt, however I missed the instruction that it must be done within 72 hours of your pick up. Oops. So when I tried to complete the survey it was a dead end. In the future I know now to complete those within 72 hours and assume its done so they can determine who was working what shifts. Either way, I'm bummed I couldn't rate that specific encounter - though, they're all usually good.

I knew their day had been insanely busy with other patients as well and they were so diligent, supportive, and at no point frustrated with me (I genuinely believe that) despite it being my insurance that was the issue. I also happen to have an auto immune disease, and one of my RX is oxycodone for pain. I'm 31 and I don't ""look sick"", so, I've been met with pharmacists/techs who weren't always so kind in the past. And like I said, Im in the medical field, so I understand why 100%.

I asked if I could bring them all coffee or a treat, anything to say thanks and maybe make the rest of the day go better. She thanked me, saying that was too kind, unnecessary, and that the receipt survey was the best way to help.  

Are you (if anyone works for Walgreens) allowed to accept something like a gift basket? Does calling the store manager and offering praise effect anything at all? Can I toss a couple gift cards in through the pickup window when I fill a scrip? (call it a holiday gift?) 

I know they're doing their job and usually make plenty of money (techs less so), but I want them to know they're appreciated because our system sucks and they/you have so many hoops to jump through I just want to know what might help. Thanks to anyone who stuck around long enough to read the whole thing. Haha.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;** My 2 pharmacists and 2 techs at my local walgreens are stellar, always above and beyond. Are receipt surveys really the best way to show appreciation/get them recognition for for their exemplary service? Are gift baskets allowed? I know some business CAN'T accept gifts/tips/anything period. You guys rock and deserve to be recognized when its consistently great work.

Unofficial Reddit CE style (sorry no credit here). Which drugs do you spend extra attention on?

Not exhaustive list by any means but just a few off the top of my head:

* **Demerol**: I had a lady's husband bring in a rx for this and she hadn't filled with us so I counseled specifically for a quick med rec and interaction check. My bias towards this drug is partly thanks to my dad who did his residency in the 80s NYC, and he constantly likes to remind me of this case of a lady who died from MAOI + demerol SS.
* **Lamotrigine**: Non-titrating doses always check hx. New start I either confirm w/ office or counsel for previous usage if the dose isn't a titrating one.
* **Anticoag**: The classic. I like to ask pts their last INR/next f/u where applicable. heparin counseling etc.
* **toradol**
* **Colchicine:** I might be overreacting but I'm just a bit wary around long term use of this; mostly it's just keeping an eye on proper dosages.
* **Codeine** products, mostly age related. Opioids in children (oxy 5/5 for burns i think is the only one I've seen regularly-ish) is auto-counsel. Fentanyl (I've actually only seen 2 TIRF Rx's thus far in my short career; one from a provider who wasn't even enrolled in REMs \*eyeroll\* and another with well-established documentation).
* **Simvastatin**: interactions/myalgia/rhab
* **FQs**: Like uncle ben told Spiderman, with great power comes great responsibility...
* iPLEDGE and Clozaril for obvious reasons.

medicine,Marijuana use in patients on controlled substance contracts.,"Hi all,

I'm a community based PCP in a state where marijuana is not yet legal. Sometimes I struggle with what to do when my patients on controlled substances either admit to or test positive for THC on routine drug screens.

I do not prescribe chronic opioids and the very few that are in my practice I inherited from other doctors and am tapering down or sustaining their prescriptions until they get into pain medicine. If they admit to marijuana I tell them to ""pick a lane"" and have no issue with tapering them faster off the opioids if they use marijuana. (since chronic opioids aren't effective anyway).

The thornier area is the ADD patients taking stimulants and the panic disorder patients and their benzos. I had a lady come to me in good faith and say she smokes weed every few evenings for her anxiety, but is otherwise high functioning in her job and thrives when she has benzodiazepine anxiolysis during the day time hours. While personally I have no issue with this, as a steward of controlled substances in this current medical climate aren't I forced to either taper them off the benzos or insist that they stop the marijuana? Or is this up to my personal judgment/shared decision making etc. Similarly, I have a few young professionals who have been treated for ADHD for 3 decades who admit to some marijuana use on the weekends--do they lose their prescription?

I'm just finding it difficult to navigate these situations, particularly as the winds of marijuana legalization are blowing. My tendency is to be somewhat liberal here, as long as there is no evidence of abuse or disorder. That said, I also don't want to create liability for myself unnecessarily.

medicine,Hormone/wellness clinics and ethics,"I've seen this occur on three different occasions, despite not doing malpractice so it's pretty bizarre. I am unsure what to do about it. The business model works as follows:

1. Advertise treatment for non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, lack of motivation, and reduced sexual drive. 

2. Once the patient arrives at the appointment, a testosterone questionnaire is given to the patient, again asking questions about symptoms such as fatigue, energy, sexual drive. 

One of the patients relaying his experience to me has a central sleep disorder and informed the staff of such.  He in his early 30s, was very fit and quite muscular and stated he had a very strong libido but otherwise scored poorly on the testosterone quiz because he was tired, etc. Based on the results of the questionnaire, a pharmaceutical representative wearing a white coat was then sent into the examination room. She stated based on the results of the questionnaire, he definitely had low testosterone and pushed a contract on him for for up to two years of hormone replacement for several thousand dollars. The potential risks were downplayed or simply not discussed at all. 

3. The patient felt very pressured but trusted the opinion of what appeared to be a legitimate medical office. Labs were ordered but prior to any results being obtained, a testosterone and hcg injection were administered to the patient the same day. 

4. The lab results came back showing all hormone levels well within the reference range. Because he had already spent well over a thousand dollars on the medication and based on the assurances he would feel and sleep better, he continued to receive weekly injections. He experienced no benefits besides some reduction in bodyfat and increased muscularity, however the patient was only interested in improving his daily energy. They also tried to sell supplements for absurdly marked up prices. 

He opted to stop without realizing he could not do so without guidance since the risks were downplayed and proceeded to feel depressed, had no libido for the first time in his life, and rapidly gained about 20lbs. He regrets ever going. 

The clinic in question seems to have locations in various states under different names. I believe you folks should be made aware of these places. These type of cases are not feasible to remedy through litigation. 

This practice model seems unethical and harmful to me but I am not a physician. I apologize if the post violates the rules (it seems as though it may since it involves a personal story). It seems to me if this conduct indeed is unethical, it will likely hurt the public's trust in medical care and should be stopped. 

I am curious to hear this community's thoughts on this behavior.

medicine,"I encountered my first bug chaser today and was frustrated enough to not want to treat the patient. I still did, of course, but man what a day. How do you manage the ""human trash"" kind of patients and resist judgement in your own practice?","Endocarditis consult today for a man who styles himself a ""bugchaser"". If you haven't heard of it this is a sexual fetish for pursuing infection with STIs. It is prevalent as a fringe subculture among homosexual men who prefer unprotected sex. Men pursue those with positive status in order to get ""pozzed"" or ""bred"", most often with HIV. 

I'm called in to see him today and we get to talking about his extensive ID history because he will need intervention and this is a bitch of an operation for someone like me to think about as a bread-n-butter private guy mostly disillusioned with the culture of healthcare. I want to transfer him to one of the major centers who have the ID team and ICU staff to take care of him correctly. We talk about how he contracted HIV. 

Turns out he has two different serotypes, on top of a few other things, and he openly admits being a bugchaser. No big deal, I know what it is. You do you. Thing is, he's also on medicaid and spends his days at home on disability and, in his words ""milking as much cock as possible"" 

Really started to piss me off inside. How can this walking public health nightmare be so angry at himself or society that he can sit at home and collect benefits while actively infecting others with HIV? 

For that matter why would anyone want to be a bug chaser? 

I try to withhold my own values judgements from patients and since I'm only a front-line doctor when I choose to volunteer I largely avoid social problems I don't want to mess with.  People like this guy, however, really strain my patience with their temerity. I hate that I used a term like ""human trash"" to describe someone. It feels like a violation of my oath. Some people, however, fit the bill. 

Thanks for letting me vent meddit.

medicine,Burnout...as an administrator,"I’m an administrator in a medical service line in an academic medical center. I know how “administrators” get talked about. I’m not sure how to impress upon you how unlike that stereotype I am. I left a 10-year career in an unrelated industry and obtained a graduate degree in health administration specifically so I could be in a position to help physicians. I wasn’t driven by an altruistic desire to make the world a better place, or even to help other patients. I was driven by my admiration for the work that physicians do and a desire to make their lives better. I don’t care about RVUs, revenues, productivity, and I’m in a position that fortunately doesn’t force me to care.

After 3 years working here, I’ve become incredibly discouraged. I’m unsure if it’s just the physicians I work with, but I’m discouraged by what's turned out to be the biggest roadblock of all: the physicians themselves. A tiny illustrative example: **sorry, I have to redact this example because it's too specific. I know this really takes the wind out of this post but I was stupid to post as many details as I did**

That’s probably the tiniest example I can think of to describe the dysfunction I work within on a daily basis. But it encapsulates the inability to agree on things, the disregard for systems, and the lack of accountability or enforcement. Imagine the above but on a larger scale, played out with decisions that affect the entire department, physician deployment, division strategy, etc. The pattern is usually: 1) physician wants something 2) we present plan to make it happen 3) we work tirelessly to make sure everyone agrees on plan 4) we work to implement plan 5) physician(s) forgets the plan/doesn’t want to do it anymore/wants a different plan.  We’ve compensated for #5 by over-communicating to a delirious extent, but the amount of wasted effort and frustration is hard to describe. 

I bring up all of the above not because it’s the wisest thing to rant about providers in a subreddit about providers, but because there’s still a sliver of me that still cares. I still want to improve things for the physicians I work with and I think I just need to be better at it. I’m just not sure how. I’m hoping that there are some providers out there who might be able to recognize what’s going on, share similar experiences, and provide some advice on how to get a group of physicians who are otherwise incredibly pleasant people to work together and (to steal from Jerry Maguire) help us help them.",80,192,2018-10-17,PHARMA,0.12168215215206146,0.8496618866920471,0.028656022623181343

medicine,Being asked if your a Christian by patients and their families.,"I am an atheist physician working at a very catholic hospital (prayers offered over the intercom, mass, run by a board of Nuns). This hospital is located in a very conservative Christian town. I keep my own personal thoughts on religion to myself.

On occasion, while I am meeting with a patient, I will get asked (either by the patient or by the family member) if I am ""Christian"". Alternatively I will be asked to pray.  

This makes me uncomfortable because the only reason I can see them asking is because they equate being a Christian with being a ""good doctor"".

First off, I don't fell like it is an appropriate question and I shouldn't be compelled to answer.

Secondly, If I don't answer, that is effectively the same as saying that I am not a Christian.

Thirdly, I am worried that if say that I am not a Christian, or admit to being an atheist, I might be the victim of some discrimination (there are physicians and administrators at the hospital who have a reputation for only hiring Christians).

One of her meds was discontinued by her doctor, so one of the pharmacists wrote “D/C” on the dosett grid... However, that particular pharmacist has the WORST handwriting ever... Somehow, “D/C” became “DIE”.  She wrote DIE four times on a very sweet 87 year old’s blister packs. Needless to say, I fixed it.

medicine,Persuading stupid patients about antibiotics,"Edit: Okay since I didn't write this particularly well, to clarify: I am not suggesting patients are stupid. But if someone doctor shops for antibiotics or complains about a physician, writes negative reviews, etc against the physician because they know better, those probably are. Some people are just totally selfish and don't care about the harm they may be causing to society. If they did, we wouldn't have measles outbreaks. I was just brainstorming for a possible persuasive argument for those people. See u/PagingDrLumps comment for a better approach. Still glad I posted this despite the downvotes because more knowledgeable people than myself shared their insight and hopefully it's helpful. 

-----

I don't have much respect for laypeople thinking they know more about when antibiotics are appropriate than, you know, someone that was trained for years in medicine. It's disrespectful and I'm sure it's frustrating as hell. I'm by no means qualified to make that determination but I trust you folks are. But what I do know is how to persuade since that's what I do. 

These people don't give a shit about antibiotic resistance so using that argument isn't going to be effective. What they do likely care about is being fat and some research suggests antibiotic use is linked to obesity. How good is this evidence? Uh hell if I know but it's great from a persuasion standpoint in this context. 

It may actually be solid evidence as well. As a former farm kid, one of the primary reasons farmers use antibiotics in feed has nothing to do with disease. Antibiotics in feed makes animals fatter and they sell by the pound. It's a horrible practice but it increases profit. 

Just an idea. Thoughts?

pharmacy,How can we get the pharmacy to run smoothly?,"The RPh Manager and I had a candid discussion last night as we stayed hours past closing just to catch up from this week. Half an hour left before close and warehouse was still sitting from the night before and 8 pages in the queue. I vented about where everything is located and how far away the drive thru is from everywhere else. The RPh said we're the highest volume store and the lowest performing one in the district. The new verification has made it more difficult. Tech hours are so low because of this and there aren't enough experienced techs. It's usually one tech and one pharmacist the whole day. The biggest issue I think is the amount of traffic the store gets. Someone could spend their entire shift at drive thru and never have a chance to spend time on production or breaking down cardinal. Cycle counts are a joke, rts is late, bags pile up without getting filed, cardinal orders are done last minute, and that phone will never stop ringing. I am forced to bring my work between drive thru and in store pickup as I bounce back and forth. It just never stops, there is never 1 minute between a customer appearing or the phone ringing. The amount of people who expect their drop off to be ready in 5 minutes is staggering and I can't believe we are forced to do this by the higher ups. Everyone thinks its so simple to get an order out, and it would be if you were the only patient at the pharmacy. Most people who come in are understanding and can see the chaos, and then some expect their party packs to be ready all together then have us run coupon cards or leave items that cost more than $0.00 all the while triage, production, and verification go red. The single biggest issue I see is how far drive thru is from all the other stations and inventory. The walk all the way over there then to sell a prescription takes a small amount of time but as you walk all the way back, another car will pull up and you have to turn around. I've floated other stores and their waiting bins are 80% smaller than ours and they have chairs for techs/pharmacists to sit around and diddle on their phones during downtime. Shifts there drag on forever, but I can say I am never bored and a 10 hour shift can fly by at my home store. I'm not burnt out or angry, I'm just frustrated and want to be more on top of things. With 2 techs and 1 pharmacist, there are just too many entry points to keep up.

medicine,Are your patients allowed outside to smoke?,"I’m just curious how other hospitals handle this. I moved from one large city to another, and got another job in an academic medical center ICU. One of my first weeks of work, I was told my patient was allowed to go outside to smoke cigarettes. This was a burn patient with multiple grafts and debridements. He was told by day shift RN that smoking may inhibit his wound healing and he understood the risks of that. MD wrote him an order, “OK to go outside” and the nicotine patch was d/c. Patient had an IV. I initially voiced my concern taking the patient and stating I don’t want to feel liable for anything that happens outside but I was assured by day shift that patients are allowed outside. I also don’t support my patients going outside for smoke breaks and I’m not sure why the hospital allows it. I was told, “This is the way it’s always been.” A majority of my coworkers smoke, so maybe that’s why no one seems to mind. So an hour into my shift, my patient comes back from outside with needles (caught on room camera) trying to shoot up. Security and house management were called. IV was taken out and MD d/c the order. Patient was discharged the next day. I’m curious if this is tolerated at your hospital.

medicine,Personal question during a (US) residency interview,"Hey Meddit. I'm applying for a (US) residency position in small subspecialty known to be overwhelmingly conservative, white, male, and married. While I am a white male, and fairly conservative politically and fiscally, I'm unmarried and gay. I'm not out at work / to colleagues. I'm a fairly private person - prefer to leave work at work, and home at home.

Last time I interviewed for positions, I was repeatedly faced with a ""difficult topic"". It was phrased in a variety of ways, but always came down to the same thing: **Are you married? Is there a young lady? What's your relationship status? How many kids ya got?** Note that this was during the formal interviews with the attendings, not the ""drinks afterward with the current fellows"" shindig. 

Now, I'm always a big proponent of putting myself into the shoes of the other. And I trust my Attendings, even when they do things that are annoying or unpalatable. So my guess at potential reasons they ask, in no particular order: They want to see that I will fit in with the (very small) group. They want to make sure that I can commit long-term to a project / relationship /team. And they want to verify that I have a social support network for when things inevitably get rough in the coming years, in a city far from home.

That said, I am not so naive as to believe that, in a small field with a *high degree of homogeneity* among practitioners, there are not *correct* and *incorrect* answers to this question. Just like we all know of a few med school friends who can pull off a bit more alternative look - piercings, tattoos, hair color - most of us recognize that choosing to publicly display or announce these attributes *will invite the possibility* of being treated differently. 

**What would you do? What is a professional way to handle overtly personal questions during a job interview? How might the uniquely monopolistic hold that residencies have on the futures of young prospects affect that decision?**

As I see it, options include, in no particular order:
A. Truth: “I have a boyfriend.” (I believe this may be career suicide)
B. Lie: “I’m single / have a girlfriend.” (this has been my classic maneuver as of yet)
C. Confront: “I believe that is an inappropriate question sir, can we move on?”
C’ Nuclear confrontation: “That is illegal to ask during a job interview.”
D. Deflect?? (I’m all ears for this one, especially if I can make it into a joke)

Let me add, before this goes too far off the rails into a legal discussion: I’m pretty unlikely to litigate this. I just don't see it helping me, but almost certainly will hurt. Reporting discrimination is not a good option *at least until* I am in a more senior position in my very small subspecialty. Even if done anonymously, they will find out who it was, and my career will be over. I at least need to repay my loans before I strangle my future hiring prospects. This is why I pose it to this group - we recognize that certain Rights are not afforded to us as residents technically, even if officially.

medicine,Discussion - looking for tips from other physicians who sought care for mental health issues,"Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I've been seeing a therapist for about a year now following a tremendously difficult breakup of a serious relationship. I've realized though that I've probably been dealing with low level depression for the last 8 years (since the start of med school). I'm becoming more interesting in potentially starting an SSRI as I'm truly just tired of feeling this way. The day I realized I needed help was the day I was doing a PHQ9 with a patient and realized MY score was much higher than theirs.

Anyways... I'm hesitant. I already had my disability insurance policy cut down and cost more because of having seen a therapist at all and I'm worried about potential ramifications to my career. As of now, it's never affected me enough to take a day off of work and I had glowing clinical comments throughout residency and in my evaluations at my new job. I'm able to put in all my energy and effort at work and actually enjoy it but the second I get home I tend to just crash. I haven't been able to accomplish a single side project (in residency or at my new job) whereas I was previously a high achiever and very motivated and driven.

I hate that I have to worry about these perceptions and I truly wish that physician's didn't have to both work such a stressful (physically, emotionally, existentially) job and then feel shame for trying to reach out when they need help. But... I feel that I should be cautious. I wanted to see if any physicians out there had received help for ongoing mental health issues and how it has affected their careers, licensure, etc. I purposefully didn't take a job I wanted in a certain state because their licensing questions were very prying into ANY treatment for ANY mental health issue :/ I don't want this to be a huge limiting factor on my career or have it be a major issue with licensure in the future.",116,277,2018-10-23,PHARMA,0.18959937989711761,0.77970951795578,0.03069104440510273

medicine,"Family medicine resident having regrets about career choice, feeling de-valued - is this common in all specialties?","I'm a family medicine resident in an urban setting in Canada at an academic centre.

I initially went into family because of the breadth and challenge of seeing undifferentiated patients and working them up as well as having that longitudinal relationship.

Now into my residency, I feel like I either lied to myself or was grossly misled about the specialty. Most patients come in, anxious with non specific complaints that I'm forced to go through the mental exercise of coming up with a differential for, that end up being nothing. Cannot tell you all the useless bloodwork/tests that are done just to ease their anxiety.

My preceptors are not overly knowledgeable either. Most of the time if I don't know what it is, they don't know and end up referring so I never make that mental connection with a presentation and end diagnosis even if it theoretically should be pretty simple. Some of the referrals that I've been forced to make are almost laughable. I am not learning any medicine or pathophysiology.

At least once a day, I am met with a patient who presents with a list of bloodwork that some herbalist/naturopath/chiropractor wants them to do. I know fully well that these ""professionals"" are unable to interpret the results or do anything with them other than make up a treatment. Yet my role as a family doctor in those instances just gets devalued down to  being a puppet for people who don't even have ordering rights. I will have at least one other patient per day who shuts down my recommendations or advice and say ""you know I've done a lot of my own research and actually \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is best. Not a lot of people know this but it's true"".

The worst part is no matter how rude patients are to me, I am always expected to maintain professionalism or bend over backwards to ""maintain rapport"".

What am I doing here? I did not go to med school to not know medicine, to constantly reassure anxious people, or to work FOR pseudoscientists. Is this common in all specialties or should I be looking at making a switch? I should add that I am otherwise very happy in my program in that most staff are supportive and my coresidents are great.

medicine,I'm worried about my attitude,"EM PGY3 at 3 year program

I never used to be this way. I was always a pretty happy-go-lucky person, had my responsibilities but was somewhat carefree and enjoying life. It's all changing now. I've gone from interested in my patients to growing disinterest and in the worst cases some internalized disdain for some of them.  

&amp;nbsp;


I love patient's who I can help. What can I say, I still like to feel useful. A reasonable person who is scarred or hurting and wants to be checked out...I am all over that. They are the only saving grace in what has become a monotony of progressive and concerning (to me) cynicism. I never used to be cynical.  

&amp;nbsp;

I start my day and just dread hearing all the EMS patches, and see the waiting room fill up with ""dizzy"" ""multiple complaints"" ""fatigue"". I am developing disdain for the family that drops off their 90-something year old relative because they all of the sudden can't care for them at home. We refuse to take grandma home, just admit her for 3 days so she can get a qualifying stay. what do you mean there is no diagnosis? What difference does it make, just admit her, we won't take her back. I feel for the hospitalist too. What can they do with a person who is old and slowly dying. Oh but of course lets refuse to make her DNR because...just because.  

&amp;nbsp;

I should say that I am always polite, smiling and respectful and professional to my patients. Even if I think your complaint is BS, like ""I almost felt dizzy the other day and really think I need an MRI"" then proceed to require 40 minutes of education as to why you don't need an MRI and meanwhile you are unsatisfied because I won't just MRI you and while I'm spending 40 minutes with you EMS has brought in 5 more weak and dizzy 90 year olds.  

&amp;nbsp;

Sometimes, like Dr Cox said
&gt;That's modern medicine. Advances that keep people alive that should have died along time ago, back when they lost what made them people. Now your job is to stay sane enough so that when someone does come in that you actually can help, you're not so brain dead that you can't function

Only I feel like I'm getting so cynical I can't function. I'm afraid to let it go on like this. But I don't know how to stop it. I don't want to live this way. I want to help people. I'm afraid if it continues I will lose my professionalism and no longer be polite and courteous to patients who I feel have BS complaints.


&amp;nbsp;

I know that it is absurd really. To them their complaints are not BS. They really are worried and that's why they've been waiting (which they're also pissed about). I know this intellectually, but my soul won't listen to reason. I feel like I'm slowly dying inside and I don't know how to stop it.

medicine,#DoctorsAreDickheads,"I was wondering how many others here on /r/medicine came across the #DoctorsAreDickheads hashtag on Twitter over the past 2 days.  On one hand, I appreciate that people are sharing stories of their mistreatment and/or dismissal by doctors.  This is a large and serious problem, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized populations.  But on the other hand, I can't believe that anyone who uses that hashtag is truly interested in engaging with doctors in a constructive way.  Seriously - who insults their target audience in the opening of a conversation?

I'm also frustrated that some of the related threads imply that the erosion of the doctor-patient relationship and mistreatment of patients is a worsening trend.  I don't have any data to support this, but from my experience, this is hard to believe.  Yes, clinically-useless administrative tasks, dysfunctional EMRs, and excessive emphasis on RVUs and metrics all reduce our empathy for our patients. But this is offset by the significant increase in emphasis that med schools are now placing on interview skills, rapport-building, shared decision-making, and the treatment of vulnerable populations.   There was zero training in any of that when I was a student.

None of this means that physicians don't have room to improve.  Of course we do.  But calling us names isn't going to help further this goal.

I started feeling more burned out reading the hot takes on this on Twitter, so I decided to see what Meddit thinks.

pharmacy,Why you should never dispense 10 mL vials of testosterone just to placate customers,"https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/9r757h/i_ing_hate_pharmacies/

&gt; FUCK these people. I think I remember reading something about some pharmacies refusing to fill 10 mL injection bottles because hurrdeedurr who fucking cares, but I would have liked to think they would at least have the FUCKING DECENCY to T E L L M E that they are DELIBERATELY FUCKING WITH HOW MUCH MEDICATION I AM GETTING COMPARED TO HOW MUCH I AM SUPPOSED TO GET.

It's always fun to have these arguments with roided up old geezers and other special snowflakes about why I won't dispense 8+ months worth of testosterone (BEFORE they get anything so they have the option to have some other pharmacy submit a fraudulent claim) even though some ignorant mid-level wrote it that way because they just do what the EMR system tells them.

Would any pharmacist say it's ok to use the same 10 mL vial of any insulin for 8+ months? Hell no, so same shit here.

I wouldn't have any problem dispensing the appropriate amount =&lt; 6 months if the manufacturers provided a specific beyond-use date, which of course they never will.",128,125,2018-10-25,PHARMA,0.04895684868097305,0.917923092842102,0.0331200510263443
medicine,Physicians with depression or disability and the law - part one,"Disclaimer: This is a bit of a rehash of some of my comments with some additional information.

I know physicians frequently fail to seek treatment or accommodations for depression or other disabilities because of worry about stigma, discrimination and potential legal issues. It's may be hard to understand unless you've been there. Physicians with medical problems are extremely vulnerable ironically. Discrimination happens more than people realize. Administration will discriminate against physicians in this context and it rarely gets punished. 

Both of our careers are uniquely vulnerable to licensing attacks for this and I was bullied by the bar for something out of my control. It was the most humiliating experience of my life. Honestly, it made me want to quit law altogether and I likely will. The only person that had my back was my physician. So I will attempt to return the favor by informing you of your rights and sharing a story. 

I was in utter disbelief when a physician reached out to me about what administration was trying to do to her for the same thing when she had a problem. For some reason I thought it'd be different for physicians. 

So what are your legal rights and what should you do if you are facing this situation?

First, it's illegal to discriminate against someone with a disability in an employment/school context. The only way it can be potentially an issue is if it impacts your ability to practice and a reasonable accommodation cannot be made for the issue. Second, your medical records are protected. Attorneys, nor anyone else can get them unless you sue for something like an injury. In a malpractice case, the most an attorney can do if they suspected a medical condition you have contributed to the injury is to have you evaluated by a physician. Honestly, I doubt it's ever even been attempted by an attorney. 

This might sound weird but this is one of those situations where an attorney can help heal a physician if they are worried. While obviously we can't treat the underlying problem, sometimes much of the stress of having a medical problem as a physician stems from the impact it can have on your career. It certainly was for me. 

I know this because I helped a physician that had a major medical problem. She was in absolute distress about her career and the impact the problem might have for her future because of administration and board discrimination. She felt powerless and that her life was spinning out of control over something she was not at all responsible for. 

First I expressed my compassion for her situation. Just as I'm sure compassion can help a patient, it helps those in distress legally. Internally, I was livid. She is a doctor and it certainly appeared she was under attack for having a medical issue. Of all the professions, medicine should be compassionate regarding this shit. But shockingly administration doesn't give a shit. I can't go into too much detail but I reassured her that if she was discriminated against, I would discriminate against them ten fold for being pricks. She couldn't defend herself but I sure as hell could. I have no mercy for this type of bullying and I absolutely will go directly to the office of the offender and put the fear of the law and litigation if that's what it takes. 

I don't know if it was my tirade or what I said exactly but she told me she felt immensely better about her situation. She reached out to thank me multiple times.

I guess my point is, sometimes you need an advocate. Just knowing someone will have your back to the bitter end and someone to explain your rights, can help ease that aspect of the problem. Don't ever feel like you cannot seek treatment because of the ramifications to your career. You are at much greater risk not seeking treatment. 

You've got nothing to fear from us in this context. Administration or maybe the licensing board you might have trouble with but someone like me will attempt to annihilate them if they try. But we can't if you don't tell us and you need to early in the process. 

Please seek help if you need it from your colleagues. They will not judge you and will not betray you. It takes courage to seek treatment and should be commended. Likewise, don't be afraid to reach out to an attorney. We are after all, professional advocates.  

Part 2, I'll focus on how administration tries to circumvent the law so you know what to watch out for if they become aware of a problem.

FADE IN:
INT. PHARMACY—DAY

Margo is scanning the never ending pile of prescriptions. The pharmacist on duty has left to buy something to eat, and was to be back in a moment. Typical day, not busy, nothing too exciting to do... But then,  ENTER ANTI-VAXXMAMA69. 

((Okay, now I’m done with the script format because it’s gonna be a little too ranty for me to worry about keeping the proper style.))

So, I paid this woman no mind when I first noticed her, she was browsing OTC items and I wanted to give her a minute before bothering her. After about a minute, she sighs very loudly and approaches the counter. 

“Why don’t you have any homeopathic items?”

Firstly, we do have a few items, but the ones I suggested were not up to her standards. I said I could check our system and, if what she was looking for was available, I could order it for her for Monday afternoon. She said that she didn’t want to wait until Monday. She needed her natural whatever now. I apologized and told her that there is a shop in the mall across the street that would be more likely to carry the products she was looking for. 

I don’t know why that set her off, but it did. 

She just started ranting about how it is my responsibility to take care of people and by not carrying more homeopathic drugs we were jeopardizing peoples’ well-being. 

Everything after that is a blur... mainly because she just started talking about vaccines causing autism and we weren’t even talking about vaccines... My eyes glazed over. 

After what felt like 600 years, the pharmacist came back with the entire grocery store (we are located within a Longo’s) and I was like, “gotta jet, buddy! Also, I taking an extra 5 minutes on my break, have fun!”

So, when I got back from my break she was gone and the pharmacist was like, “you owe me.”

I’m a medical student who witnessed their first emergency yesterday outside the hospital.

medicine,"Input needed to deal with ""problem"" fellow.","I'm being vague and using a alt account for privacy reasons. 
Our new fellow is quite a handful. 
Knowledge base is acceptable. This is a trainignporgaram so we anticipate deficits and aren't too bothered about this aspect. Overall very friendly and amiable. 

Things where this person is really driving us nuts :

* often misses histroy/ clinical exam findings. We have remained this person again and again, but same mistakes. 

* no sense of prioritizing tasks. 

*any unexpected challenges or unusual situations gets flustered and literally runs away fom the task. In fact this person even calmly walked off a ongoing rapid response. 

*nothing is ever this person's fault. Some  excuses : Too many patients, I forgot this detail. I didn't think this was important so I didn't ask/persue. Too basic. Too complicated. Residents should have done this. I used to teach residents and med students, why are you treating me like one. You never pick on the other fellows. Too much work. Too much work to review charts everyday, I don't feel like a real doctor. (on light rotations) nothing to do this rotation, so couldn't learn anything relevant.

* zero insights into shortcomings. Constructive criticism is viewd as a personal attack. 

*cognitive errors abound - has a real issue with Aggregate bias. Gets stuck on some mundane aspect of the clinical picture and asks for increasingly absurd levels of references. I once spent 30minutes trying to get my point across. Apparently I learnt that personal experice and a old textbook are more valid then up-to-date , pubmed, WHO and CDC guidelines. I gave up on that conversation. 

* terrible sign outs, even on the person's own patients. Vage and includes mostly  information  which this person perceives as important. 

*remedial sessions and constructive sessions end in  This person crying and accusing the faculty of discrimination. Emotional blackmail abounds. 


I really feel for this fellow and the department is trying to help this person.

According to the Doctors note patient's anxiety is well controlled on it and has been on this regimen for years. I'm not familiar with this type of regimen where we alternate between SSRIs and I couldn't find any evidence supporting this type of practice.

medicine,Do doctors have a responsibility to look/be relatively healthy?,"Question in title. I was talking with some fellow students about this today. Obviously, not being obese and being a nonsmoker is *healthier*, but they seemed to virtually take it for granted that a doctor who looks fit/doesn't smoke etc. is *better for patients* when dealing with problems like obesity or smoking cessation, because they ""lead by example"" -- sort of an extension of the classic parenting problem, ""do what I say, not what I do"". Skin in the game, I suppose.


They spoke of their own experiences in whose advice they tended to take seriously, and generally agreed that they listened more to people who practiced what they preached. Which is fair enough, I guess you'd want e.g. your personal trainer to look like they work out a lot, but do patients really look to their doctors as inspirational models in the same way? I couldn't help but notice that this was coming from a bunch of very fit mid-20s people. Obesity carries a great deal of stigma, overweight people are often very ashamed of their bodies. It seems to me that perhaps it also makes it more difficult for a sixty year old cab driver to take advice if their physician looks like they run marathons for fun -- because of the stigma, or a perceived lack of ability to sympathise with how hard losing weight is, or because they simply feel less kinship/shared hardship. I imagine having some ubermensch list all the ways in which you need to improve to be healthy might actually be pretty demoralising and demotivating.


I'm not suggesting doctors should be unhealthy for the sake of their patients (or healthy), or that patients should only be treated by physicians that look like them, or anything ridiculous like that. I'm just curious whether the physician's appearance has an impact on patient compliance/motivation/emotional well-being, what it's like for the patient to meet a doctor who has some personal experience with their troubles vs. someone who seems to have their shit together perfectly.


In short, barring the problems that come with expecting physicians to be superhuman (more than they already are), how do factors like the doctor's own appearance and actions affect patient motivation for weight loss, smoking cessation, and so on?",282,383,2018-10-30,PHARMA,0.08309098333120346,0.8913143873214722,0.025594647973775864
pharmacy,How do you guys get over the lack of respect for this field?,"I'm not even talking about mean patients in retail pharmacy or people who think we just count pills. That, actually is what I assumed people meant by lack of respect going into the field and I was fully prepared for and i'm okay with. But what really bothers me and what I didn't expect is the lack of respect from the general public and/or other healthcare professionals. I actually love this field. I love what I studied. I love what I get to learn. I really like drugs. And I LOVE my job. Hell - even crazy ass patients in the pharmacy yelling when I was in retail don't bother me too much because honestly, any healthcare professional is going to have to deal with angry sick people sometimes and I can see why someone who has no concept of what goes on in a pharmacy would be so upset. Plus I used to work with a really sassy tech who made me laugh when that type of stuff shit happened.

But what kind of bothers me is the lack of respect from the general public who do know the importance of what we do and especially other healthcare professionals. In my experience, the healthcare professionals that seem to respect us the MOST ironically are physicians since they rely on us so much and know how much we know. But when I talk to my dentist friends for example, they go to the same amount of schooling as us, yet they seem to look down on me for not being a ""doctor"" even though I have a doctorate and am as much of a doctor as they are. Even freaking chiropractors get called doctors, but not us.  Or nurses who talk to me as if i'm a midlevel, but I don't really see myself as one when the physician is the one coming to me for my expert opinion every time, not them watching over me like they would a PA. Or when I talk about my schooling and people tell me ""oh pharmacy is only 6 years of schooling"" when in reality that's only if you go straight from high school (medicine and dentistry can also be 6 years in that case) when the majority of pharmacists have an undergrad degree and go the 4+4 route.  Idk growing up I always looked up to pharmacists so realizing this is the perception by the general public was a bit disheartening.

Idk its just really bumming me out. I normally don't care about respect, but to spend a better part of my 20's studying all the time getting a doctorate in this field only for it to be treated like a joke is kind of infuriating. I love everything else about the field except for this fact that is kind of bothering me.
