medicine,"Older docs: ""When did medical care start to suck?""","I've been around a while, and although I might be a touch dense, I just realized that medical care really sucks.

Back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, my doctor had a private practice a nurse and a receptionist. He was happy, enjoyed his work, had a nice practice and made enough money to go golfing on whatever day he took off, buy a nice house, get married and have kids. He had time to spend with his patients, figuring out what's actually going on and what to do about it.

Now it's ~35+ years later, and he's part of some giant medical group owned by one of the hospitals and they work him like a 12 year old sewing Nikes in a sweatshop in Asia.

He doesn't get his ""golf day"" anymore and told me he thinks he'll never be able to retire. I saw his schedule and as near as I can tell, he sees a new patient every 8 minutes, all day long.

It's not just him. I see a pulmonologist for OSA, and he's in no better shape than my internist.

In the mean time, health insurance has gone *way* up and despite the best  efforts of the docs I deal with, the technical quality of the care is actually pretty bad. If I don't already know what's going on and what I need, it's pretty much a shot in the dark if whoever I see will figure out what's going on and actually know what to do about it.

* When did all this happen?
* Why are docs kept so busy?
* Where does all the money go? My internist isn't getting it, and considering that the local hospitals are always on the verge of bankruptcy, they're not getting it either.

pharmacy,nsaid and ace inhibitor,"I don't understand exactly how NSAIDs are ANTAGONISING the hypotensive effect of ace inhibitors.

NSAIDs cause vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole so there's reduced blood flow to the glomerulus. ACE inhibitors are causing vasodilation of the efferent arteriole so there's reduced glomerular pressure. Surely this means NSAIDs are not antagonising the effect of ACE inhibitors but instead, increasing hypotensive effect overall? I


I can understand how these two, along with diuretics cause acute kidney injury due to really reduced pressure in the glomerulus but not how NSAIDs are specifically antagonising ACEI? 


Is the antagonising effect just really due to the NSAIDs general inhibition of prostaglandin I2 and increased thromboxane causing vasoconstriction, and not really because of the specific renal effects of NSAIDs?",6,18,2017-07-03,PHARMA,0.20596906542778015,0.7694344520568848,0.0245965588837862

medicine,"What's up with ""adrenal fatigue""?","Heard the term during a visit to a registered dietician. Is this a legit medical condition, or another one of those pseudo medical diagnoses? 

A more accurate term seems to be ""mild dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.""

(I don't have the expertise to interpret the info out there myself, I'm just a MA.)

Some quick Googling turns up quite a few websites that make ""adrenal fatigue"" seem like another vague, unsubstantiated syndrome from which unscrupulous naturopaths/nutritionists/etc. can profit. Mayo Clinic seems to agree - ""The unproven theory behind adrenal fatigue is that your adrenal glands are unable to keep pace with the demands of perpetual fight-or-flight arousal. As a result, they can't produce quite enough of the hormones you need to feel good. Existing blood tests, according to this theory, aren't sensitive enough to detect such a small decline in adrenal function — but your body is.""

However, a quick scan of related research seems interesting. The research I found in my quick search was about 2 main things - HPA axis dysfunction as a mediator of obesity, and HPA axis dysfunction as an explanation for many of the symptoms of chronic fatigue. The research I skimmed seemed inconclusive, but seems like a trend in HPA axis depression in both obesity and chronic fatigue syndrome has reared its head.

medicine,[X-post r/science] PPI's found to lead to higher risk of death than H2 blockers,"[r/science post](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6lat1i/popular_heartburn_drugs_called_proton_pump/) • [Article](https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/popular-heartburn-drugs-linked-higher-death-risk/) • [Study](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e015735)

Prescribed and over the counter PPI's are more prevalent and accessible these days. Even with the increased risk of death, there has been speculatively more reductions in life threatening ulcers and maybe even the prevention of some esophageal cancers.  Excerpt from the article:

&gt; ... sifted through millions of de-identified veterans’ medical records in a database maintained by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. They identified 275,933 people who had been prescribed a PPI and 73,355 people prescribed an H2 blocker between October 2006 and September 2008, and noted how many died and when over the following five years. The database did not include information on cause of death.

Essentially, given access to patient records stored in some form of big data system, it seems that they were able to correlate PPI's to deaths given the two focus groups.  Data mining can be just as unuseful to draw a correlation between data points as well as give new insight into an unknown problem. Given that it's titled ""risk of death"" instead of ""observed death rates"" I expected the study to have more information regarding the causes of death such as heart/kidney complications, suicides, etc.  Is this the only way the medical community is able to communicate that there is sufficient evidence to show that a highly prescribed drug matches up with a subset of the annual death rates ?

5/ We go back to the counter, we scan the boxes, we count them and give them to the patient. We must scan the prescription and print behind the list of drugs

Sometimes (often) we must take the information about their insurance, indeed in France :
65% or 35% or 15% of the price of the drug is paid by France
The rest by private insurance 

So a basic day for a pharmacist is : standing all day long behind a desk, go get boxes, scan prescription, print on the prescription, a delivery must be fast, because time is money. So often you see 40-50 patients days, bringing boxes all day long

medicine,To new residents/interns: tips and tricks from a nurse,"Hey r/medicine. I struggled with whether or not to write this, if it's not appropriate please let me know. 

I've been an RN for 5 years, medical/oncology as a charge nurse and a travel nurse for the last 1.5. As a result I've interacted with many residents and many many nurses. I know that dealing with nursing is a fairly small part of your day to day, but I thought I'd share some tips and tricks that might help things go smoother and maybe make your lives a little easier. This is likely going to be quite long. 

Quick primer for those with minimal hospital experience:

**CNA/nurse assistant/nurse aide**: can get vital signs, can record I/O, has very minimal to no medical training, though this varies some by state. Are the ones who typically walk patients, take them to the bathroom, turn and change them, etc. are very likely afraid of you and can be as young as 16.  


**unit clerk** sits at the front desk,  smiles at you, probably in business casual. Can get ahold of anyone at any time, and knows which nurse has which patient. Good ones know which doctors from which service are on that day, what time everyone goes home, after hours pagers, when other docs typically round. A good clerk could get you on a conference call with the derm attending on Christmas Eve and Jesus.  


**floor nurse** either an LPN, or an associates/bachelors prepared RN.  Important note, hospitals have pretty much phased out hiring LPNs and grandfathered in the ones who were working when the switch was made. Consequently most LPNs are 170 years old and phenomenal nurses. Don't let the lesser education fool you. They also tend to be sassy in a Laverne from scrubs way. 


**charge nurse** almost always an RN with a couple of years experience at a minimum.  Typically has a specialty certification related to the unit they are on. Typically don't have patients of their own, though sometimes they do. Charge nurses handle emergencies, know a little bit about all of the floor's patients, act as a resource, handle all the weird stuff that comes up etc. this nurse is undoubtedly money under pressure and you can likely count on him or her to be competent and know their stuff. 

**everyone says to suck up to nurses or they will make my life miserable** I can honestly say I have never seen this in my time as a nurse all over the country. I'm sure it happens, my apologies if it does, and you should pursue the proper channels if nurses are doing something to hinder patient care. The truth is we tend to get a little grumpy when a new team takes over because our jobs are really really busy. Administration has cut our staffing to the ragged edge and so any changes disrupt our flow. Just a couple weeks ago I had a patient where a resident ordered a CTA to r/o PE and wrote in her note that it was really important to get the results asap. Unfortunately she put it in for routine instead of stat because while she was putting in the orders someone had gotten ahold of CT and they said they could do it right then. At our facility this means that a radiologist won't read it until the morning because it was put in after 7pm and as routine. I didn't catch this until 10pm when I was reading the note so I had to call her at 10pm and get it all sorted out which took multiple phone calls and time. It's not her fault, it's an idiosyncrasy of the hospital, and impossible to know unless it's come up before, or you spend your down time reading policy and procedure. It's all little things like this that make life busier and can make us cranky. In 5 years of nursing there has only been one resident I've truly despised, and it's because she is a dick. Not a bad doctor or anything, just a genuinely unpleasant person.  I doubt she knows or cares I dislike her, and I've never done anything to cause her difficulty out of spite. If I like you however, I'll go out of my way to make your life easier. When I was a charge nurse for a 39 bed unit my favorite resident of all time was making small talk at the elevator and told me he was exhausted.  Knowing that I asked the 8 nurses I was in charge of to page me prior to paging him unless it was an emergency. I had a lot of new nurses on the floor at the time and I saved him a couple of 2am colace calls and other such nonsense, and managed to group pages so he wouldn't get bugged multiple times from my unit. That's not our policy or anything, but he went truly above and beyond for me once, so I was happy to try and help out (hope you got some sleep buddy).  If I disliked him, I wouldn't have told everyone to page him maliciously, I just wouldn't go though that extra effort for him.  That's the sort of thing nurses can do for you, but I'm not going to skip blood sugar checks because you're an asshole. 

**enough already! How do I make my life easier?** 
1.when you admit a patient, please try to put in basic prn's.  If it's appropriate, Tylenol, melatonin, zofran and colace will go a long way towards letting you sleep. I can do a lot of tap dancing with basic prns. 

2. Try to touch base with the nurse before you take off. I know this sometimes isn't doable, but it saves you time in the long run. I can tell you before you leave that the pt is super concerned about her discontinued multivitamin, or that she's not going to be able to stand for the X-ray or whatever and not have to page you later about something stupid when your brain is already 2 patients past her. If you can't find the nurse touching base with the charge nurse is a decent alternative. Otherwise don't worry about it, we get it if you have to run. 

3. If I call with something abnormal, give me parameters for when you want me to call back. If I call with a BP of 190/100 and you order 10mg if hydralazine, I'm going to have to call you back when it's 168/92. If you take the time to tell me ""if he drops below 170 systolic then You don't need to call me, day team can address better control in the morning. Keep an eye on it and let me know if he creeps over 170 again"" then you don't have to get woken up in an hour. Or if the pt has a 2.8s pause on tele and you say ""ok"" and hang up, you're really putting me in a tough spot. I can guess you don't care, but what if the next one is 3.7s? What if I don't call and he tanks? Good nurses are acutely aware that they are expenditures to the hospital while providers are revenue generating assets. We live in constant fear of being fired because we missed something important. Also our knowledge of medicine is largely algorithmic. We are a house built on stilts so to speak. So we may just be calling because we genuinely don't know how big a deal something novel is. A little background and parameters makes us breathe easier.  (My apologies to the resident I called 3 times when I was a new grad because he was running insulin and d5 at the same time. I figured it must have been an oversite). 

4. We don't expect you to know every nurses name on the floor, but it would be extra credit for you if you learned the charge nurses name on the floors you are on a lot. Saying ""hey Jeff, who has 340 today?"" Comes across so much better than standing on a chair in the nurses station and yelling ""who has 340?""  Plus knowing who the charge nurse is means you have a reliable nurse you know. There is a big gap in skill between the best and the worst nurses. If Jeff the charge nurse is very concerned about one of your patients, it would be wise to pay attention. I may not know the neurogenesis of vasovagal syncope but I've seen a lot of people get real sweaty and poop themselves unconscious, and I can kind of feel it coming now. Also just getting to know one familiar face can help. I was the only male on my last floor so I was the point of contact for many docs, we don't mind.

5. Ask us stuff! We know our floor inside and out. I can show you where the exam light switches are, how to move the bed around, how to make the IV stop screaming. I've got pockets full of stuff you can borrow, granola bars you can have, I picked a career that is all helping other people, I enjoy it.  Plus I enjoy the dichotomy of showing a brilliant neurosurgery resident how to use the automatic blood pressure cuff.  I know you aren't going to want my opinion on what antibiotic to use, but I can find you the only otoscope in the hospital.  Side note, if you take my stethoscope off of the unit I will find you and murder you. 

Finally, please don't assume I'm stupid because I'm not as educated as you are. I chose a career that lets me be in medicine, work 36 hours a week, that ends the second I walk out the door, and that lets me get paid to travel all over the country with my wonderful wife and really enjoy our 20s.  Yea I clean up poopies and I've shaved a couple dicks but I've got 4 years of reasonably difficult education and 5 years of significant clinical experience. If I call you gravely concerned about something at least hear me out.  Nurses are trained to not directly challenge physicians but to sort of supplicant around problems. ""Hey dumbass we can't give potassium IV push unless the electric chair is on the fritz"" becomes "" you know typically the pharmacy likes us to bolus potassium over a couple hours, it's their policy sorry but I wonder if we could change it from IV push?""  This needs to change, but nurses, especially old school ones or frightened new grads, are likely to rely on it.  

THANK YOU for taking the long hard road of physician training. The world needs you, and we are lucky to have you.  There are very few people who can do what you are doing.   Relax and breathe, it'll be ok. We are here to help however we can.  And remember your attendings and senior residents goof up all the time, like the one who ordered scd's on a bilateral BKA recently.

medicine,I think I might be getting targeted by admin - input welcome.,"Original posts [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/5x7lka/update_having_some_issues_with_a_nurse_could_use/)

Basically - I was having issues with an LPN questioning my orders/being rude/compromising patient care/making racist comments, so I brought it up to admin and it wasn't handled well -- including the admin person who was supposed to ""mediate"" the meetings basically berating me for having asked the union for advice on how to handle this situation appropriately and effectively. She also conducted individual interviews and asked everyone on my team if they ""thought anyone was being racist"" - and she didn't ask me that, even though I had brought up the original concerns.  

Since then, there have been more and more frequent instances of me getting 'pushed out' of projects/passed up for things, even though I was pretty much acting as the department chair. 

In addition to my regular job, I also run a free clinic for undocumented immigrants (mostly Hispanic families) on my spare time. My regular job is aware of my efforts to get involved in outreach for our immigrant population, and I recently published a piece related to the health and care of immigrant children and families. 

So a few weeks ago my job decided they would do an outreach program at one of the local Hispanic churches to make sure we are getting patients set up with services at our clinic. I volunteered to go and assumed I would be chosen to go. Today I found out that I wasn't selected to go, and that the person in charge of deciding who would participate in the outreach program was the same person that ""mediated"" our meetings in the past. I really don't think this is an accident, and I am not sure what I should do about it. It's not this particular instance that I am concerned about -- it is more of a bigger picture kind of thing (e.g. them leaving me out of more and more things as time goes by and eventually pushing me to just quit.) 

What are your thoughts? How should I approach this? 

I know there isn't a great way to prove that this is what the person is actually doing, but I thought about keeping track of these kind of things to have some evidence to refer to in case I need to in the future. 

Anyway - any input greatly appreciated.

medicine,Medical gloves not fitting due to BD - any advice?,"I just started a new job that requires me to wear medical gloves pretty much all day.  If I get blood/other nasties on them, I've gotta change them.  So, there's a decent amount of changing gloves.  

Here's my issue:  I was born with a birth defect called Poland's Syndrome.  The fingers on my right hand are quite a bit shorter than my left hand - which is unaffected.  Imagine a normal finger that is simply missing the last last phalange (distal) - so, instead of three phalanges, I basically only have two.  I'm running into issues getting the gloves on my right hand.  If I try the small gloves, it's a PITA to get them on.  If I go medium (what I wear on my left hand) they're easy to get on, but there's about an inch of unused glove at the end.  What I've been doing is putting on the medium gloves and kind of pulling the excess down - which kind of wrinkles it, but it makes it so that there's no excess on the tips.  

The problem, is that this takes some time and I'm finding this time adding up throughout the day making me less productive.  

Does anybody have any suggestions?  I've kind of been wondering if they make a medical glove for people with normal sized hands but really short fingers?  Or, are there any companies that make ""custom"" gloves?

I was shadowing the Oncology team at the academic hospital my school is affiliated with. The team I was with contained the usual medical residents and students, pharmacy residents and students, and the attending physician. during rounds we saw fairly cookie cutter patients that the residents and students could take care of with some help of the attending. However, a complicated patient came up that was beyond our level of knowledge and ability. 

The oncology clinical pharmacist came to help with the patient and commenced a 10 minute conversation between her and the attending. The amount of knowledge that both of those were spewing were absolutely amazing. The way that each complimented each other when it came to treatment and diagnoses really cemented my opinion that doctors and pharmacist should really work together more.

I thought it was a cool encounter so I figured I would share",98,403,2017-07-14,PHARMA,0.01956069841980934,0.923956036567688,0.05648327246308327

medicine,Why aren't doctors opening more private practices in response to high hospital costs?,"I've heard it said on this sub and elsewhere that hospital bills are very large but doctors' salaries are a small fraction of it. I saw one guy on this sub say that the hospital got ""tens of thousands"" of dollars while he was only reimbursed like $1400. The popular pro-physician line is that hospital administrators and CEOs are pocketing all that money while the poor doctor is being taken advantage of. 

If this is the case, then the free market dictates that the doctors should just open their own practices and charge less, and patients would flock to them because they would be paying less. But recent trends show that the number of private practice docs is decreasing- why is that?

If I had to attempt to answer my own question, I would assume this is because the healthcare industry is not a free market. With insurance, mandatory compliance/regulation, IT requirements, etc. it becomes too expensive for small businesses to navigate the maze of regulations and overhead, and makes them less competitive in comparison to hospitals. 

Even so, I find it hard to believe that hospitals make $10 for every $1 that a doctor makes- no corporation can operate with that much overhead. Maybe my numbers are just wrong. Would love to hear your thought!",32,52,2017-07-14,PHARMA,0.03234304487705231,0.9221673607826233,0.04548962414264679

medicine,New fellow - am I doing it wrong?,"Hi guys,

I am a new hem/onc fellow. My co-fellow is upset with how the team is running. Hence I came here for advice.

So I'm on benign heme month with a 2nd year fellow and residents. I am just proactive and reach out to all the residents to go over their plans, make sure their presentations are good. I also call in smears and look at them myself or with the residents and present the findings to the attending. I also created a group mail where I email out important articles relevant to that day's patients.

The residents are from my home program, some of them know me from before, so I guess they feel more comfortable approaching me right away if they have questions, and everyday I sit down with them to run the list and ask if they need help with anything. I walk a bit faster than other people, so during rounds I am usually ahead of the group directing them wherever we need to go. I have worked with this attending before as a resident, so he sometimes refers to our prior patients or shared experiences.

My co fellow is one year ahead of me, she always leaves as soon as rounds are over, has told the attending she is interested interested in breast, and the attending got an idea that she isn't interested in benign heme. She doesn't do most of the things I have listed above. She didn't know where the lab was so I showed her so that she can look at the smears herself.

She told me today that she is feeling a bit left out. She asked a resident about one patient and the resident probably told her that he had already discussed the pt with me.  She felt offended. She also said that I'm emailing too many articles and it's an information overload for the residents and I should tone it down. She also said that from next week she wants to see one more patient than me. She wants the ""team dynamics to be better""

I don't know what to do. I am thinking of taking a step back and giving her the space. But overall I felt this was really poor work ethic on her part and am feeling very frustrated. I have to work with her on another consult month later.

Any suggestions would be appreciated. I am happy to answer any questions to provide you a better insight in to the situation.



EDIT: Hi guys, 

Thank you all for sharing your advice. I truly appreciate it.

- I have decided to take a step back for the 2 weeks that are left.

- I will ask half of the residents to discuss their patients with me and the rest to discuss with the other fellow.

- I will make an effort to demonstrate to the team that she's the boss and not me. 

- I won't share more than 3 articles per day. The max I had shared were 5 articles, with days where things were straightforward and I didn't need to share any articles. She shared just one article in these 2 weeks and it was something completely irrelevant to the patients we saw.

- I will let her direct rounds.

As pointed out by one poster, I probably do not know her side of the story and what exactly prompted her to feel this way.

I don't have to prove anything to anyone. The residents do not get to evaluate me. The attending already knows me well.

Make sure your ID's match your NABP profile exactly (including middle name),"This includes having your middle name on your testing info if it is on your ID. For example if your ID says: John Thomas Smith, make sure your test name is either John Thomas Smith or John T. Smith.

If your ID has your middle name and your test information does not, you will not be allowed into the testing center. This problem has bit a few of my fellow classmates and is almost biting me.

To take care of it call NABP on the phone (1-847-39-4406). They will want an email or fax that contains the following: 

* A scanned copy of your primary/secondary IDs with the name that should be listed on your ATT.

* In the body of your email or on a fax page, this information: Full name, Address, The last 4 digits of your Social Security number (if you have one), Date of birth, and your e-Profile ID.

Reports from classmates say this can be resolved within a day if you give them a call. Best of luck everyone!

Update: I called NABP and they started updating it while I was on the phone.

medicine,Would it be a good idea to have a weekly/monthly thread where people admit mistakes they've made?,"This sparked an idea from reading [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/6obhbl/i_hurt_a_patient_today/). Part of the culture of medicine has been this fear of making mistakes, and if you've made them, being petrified of owning up to them out of fear of retribution from patients or insults from colleagues. I feel that there's been a huge effort in getting people to admit to their mistakes during my medical school training and what I've experienced so far in internship.

So, would it be a beneficial thing to have a monthly thread where people are free to post mistakes they've made? I feel like this would help open up the dialogue so that people can move forward, and would also help teach others so they can hopefully avoid making that same mistake.

The caveat is that I would like for posters to violate Rule #9 (no throwaways allowed), for the obvious reason that it would better facilitate discussion if the poster could remain anonymous. 

Thoughts?

medicine,I'm thinking about maybe withdrawing (M2). Can you give me your advice on this?,"Hi

I know this might not be the best place to post this but I would specifically like advice from those who are already working as doctors and not just a student in med school. I didn't really have many people to talk to about this and so I'm posting it here and hoping someone can give me some advice. I'm hoping I can leave it here for a few days to get some advice and inputs to help me make a decision. 

Im in a US MD School. I struggled in first year and took 2 years to complete it. I'm about to start the second year but I am considering just leaving instead of paying for a whole year's tuition. The main reason for this is the very high cost of attendance. What I am scared of is what would happen if I struggle in 2nd or 3rd year as well and am delayed even more? The thought of the amount of interest and loans is too much for my mind. I have a hard time accepting the amount of money I am taking out for this goal.

You might be wondering why I didn't think about this when I accepted the position. I guess mainly because all the people I talked to told me that everyone takes out student loans for med school. I didn't think about what I would do with all these loans if I cant finish med school. I always thought that I'll be fine.

So now the choice in front of me is, do I pay another years of schooling and try my best to get through it. or do I just call it quits now, instead of failing more courses and calling it quit after 1 more year and another years of student loan? Now I don't know 100% of I will struggle in 2nd year too. but I also don't know with 100% that I will be success in 2nd year either. Usually at my school, the 2nd year is the hardest.

Do I just leave now, pay back what loans I owe by working for afew years and then maybe some day reapply to try to get into a cheaper instate school?

I'd appreciate any of your thoughts on this matter.

Thanks",43,115,2017-07-20,PHARMA,0.052721139043569565,0.9073669910430908,0.0399119071662426

Same thing happened to a friend. He made good money, didn't cheat, didn't abuse drugs, didn't abuse her - she divorced him right after residency.

Two other doctors I know - one residency divorce and maybe the other relationship too. Which would make 4 divorces during residency for the 4 doctors I know.

pharmacy,My Sunday so Far,"By myself of course today. Just wanted to give a quick run down of what to expect when you're by yourself on any day! Hopefully a little entertainment for your weekend while you laugh at us poor blokes working today.

* First customer,  young child prescribed zofran tablets but can't swallow them. Wants them switched to ODT obviously. Doctor of course not picking up.

* Second customer. Filled her 6 Rx 3 weeks ago and she's now coming to get them. They are already put back and she doesn't want to wait. Oh well.

* Third customer wants me to transfer her controlled substance from other pharmacy. After calling them and figuring out its because she's going out of town but the other pharmacy filled a 7 day supply yesterday as a partial until they receive their order. Umm maybe dont accept a partial if you cant wait until Monday? Or try another pharmacy of the same chain at least?

* Then I'm going to fill the 6 Rx for lady #2 and realize my technician from yesterday stocked the wrong size caps so I have no small caps. Big bottles for everyone.

* Fourth customer drops of Rx for test strips but the brand she just bought a meter for isn't covered by insurance. She wants to return the meter but didn't buy it here. She's panicking because she doesnt want to pay for a new meter, understandable but not much i can do right now as doctor is closed.

* Also not included was lady asking me what her husband has a callous or a corn and I'm trying to explain they are similar and products treat both but without seeing it she could compare pictures on Google herself or see foot doctor for best treatment. Then a typical doctor shopper with percocet rx when they got 120 from another pharmacy 2 weeks ago. Then another lady just bought a meter and I went over it with her yesterday but she is mad that control solution wasn't included and thank God I had one in stock. 

* Also had someome come in for a flu shot.

* Had someone with those REALLY long fingernails who was struggling so hard with getting any cards out of their wallet. Of course they had to get their ID, customer card, and credit card each taking about a minute of fumbling around until I would just reach over and help.

Well hopefully this chills out a bit since it is Sunday! Just my first 20 to 30 minutes.

Update: doctor never called back on zofran. Tried to call again but no luck. Poor guy.  It's so silly we can't change dosage forms in a situation like that. They took their Rx and were going to just drive over there (they said they are open). Lady with the meter and strips is finally starting to understand how they have to match up (thought she could use different brand strip with other meter). 

Update2: Doctor finally got back to me after 2 hours to change the zofran to ODT.",54,71,2017-07-23,PHARMA,0.10982739925384521,0.8627995848655701,0.027372976765036583

Posting under my real handle here because I think it's important to be honest with ourselves and peers when we're at risk. 

In my case I've had a really bad few nights of call and a very demanding month. My clinical work isn't struggling yet but I've been on edge and bitchy with everyone. Mentally I'm feeling drained and I've gone from being a cheerful, relaxing presence to secretly resenting certain patients. Haven't had any time for just me or the things I do to maintain personal wellness in the past few weeks. Not feeling motivated to do them either.

These are warning signs. I know this. I think I'd feel better with a months vacation to just get my energy back but that's not really an option. How have others here approached this with partners in a way that doesn't screw everyone over, doesn't make the hospital or board think you're going to go on a murder rampage but is also respectful of the need to take care of yourself?

All advice welcome. Good advice will be thanked and utilized :)

medicine,The reason why some people treated with anti-depressants commit suicide.,"My Neurology attending sometimes blurred the lines between fact and his philosophy. For this one, I'm not too sure:

He said the reason that some people with depression commit suicide after being treated with anti depressants is that they suddenly come to the realization that they have wasted years of their life being depressed, hurt loved ones close to them in the process, and generally feel heavy guilt for living with depression for so long and this leads them to suicide. I couldn't find any literature on it, but it sounds like a plausible theory.

- Fluoxetine

- Ziprasidone

The patients have no clue what they take and if any medicine was discontinued when a new medicine was added.

Also, Ziprasidone is contraindicated with any QTc prolonging agent. But everyone is taking hydroxyzine/prozac/zoloft or other along with it.

99% of the time the MD office never calls back about their current regimen or if the check QTc.

The patient demands the medicine of course.

Occasional bacteria. I asked the ED physician if they thought this person had a uti, and they said without leuk esterase and nitrite its absolutely not a uti.

On a separate occasion had a preceptor who saw someone's UA without micro that had neg leuk esterase and nitrite and he said he didn't care about those results, only a urine culture could tell him whether or not a lady had a uti, despite ""what other physicians seem to think"".

I am obviously very confused. I was always taught that if someone has symptoms and elevated WBCs in the urine, regardless of what the rest of the results say, this might be a UTI.

I only mention his age because he's getting confused. And, semi-related, his nickname amongst all the women at work who aren't directly descended from him is ""sexual harassment grandpa."" He usually only works from about 4 to 6:30 but Thursday he's there all day, which kind of prompted this.

Examples from the last week or so:

-told an elderly patient ""cetraline"" was generic for Zyrtec and she should take it for her allergies. He spelled it like that several times.

-can't pay attention to a cash price approval unless I clear every other thing off my workspace because no matter how many times I say ""that thing is unrelated, I just need a cash price"" he keeps grabbing labels off the counter

-told me to get a vacation override but that if I couldn't, I should reverse a filling from 2 months ago (on an insurance that only allows a 30-day backdate) and change the day supply so it would go through today

-visibly spaces out when I ask for contraindication and interaction overrides (so I just print them)

-emergency filled a full box of lidocaine patches instead of giving two or three

-has stopped dating phoned-in prescriptions and gets upset if I write the date on it and he sees it

-lost track of his sentence telling a patient about how birth control prescribing by a pharmacist (specifically, him!) works and had to start from the beginning

-gave an old home address to the board and didn't get his renewed license before the old one expired, blamed it on them

-put $14 worth of $1 stamps on a padded mailer with a priority mail label and receipt (""it fits it ships"" style, so it should have gone in a box and the postage was prepaid)

-edit to add: the PIC and I have had a secret signal in place for years that means ""I didn't want to but he made me, I know this is ethically wrong/against procedure/whatever""

Is there a point at which I should report him to the board? What would I even report him for, being old? Also, he's kinda famous in our area... and I think all my coworkers would know it was me.

medicine,One Year Later - How One Rural FP Saved His Practice From From The Opioid Pandemic,"I posted to this reddit about one year ago, seeking advice on how to save my practice. I was right out of residency, and had inherited a patient population who had been prescribed opioids, benzodiazepines, and stimulants very liberally. Those classes of medications are written in prolific volumes throughout this entire region. Between the patients I inherited, and patients coming from as far as hundreds of miles away to test a new physician’s narcotic prescribing habits, literally 75% of the appointments being scheduled were patients specifically requesting narcotics of one form or another. 

It was at a crisis level. My staff and I were overwhelmed, and I was unable to get my diabetics, hypertensives, or any other patients seen as often as they should be. The non-narcotic patients who did get in to see me found considerable wait times, as the narcotic patients would haggle, threaten, and/or beg, consuming disproportionate amounts of time from my other patients. Verbal abuse was a daily problem. Attempts at intimidation were common. My nurses would cry. There were death threats and calls to administration. To make matters worse, the closest pain management specialist was 45-60 minutes away.

For other young physicians coming out of residency and finding themselves in this situation, know that you can get through it. I have a thriving and healthy practice only a year later, seeing enough patients that I will be adding a mid-level to assist me. 

I started sending a letter to every single new patient scheduled, notifying them that I do not prescribe chronic opioids, benzodiazepines, or stimulants. I would be happy to care for their other medical conditions, but they would be referred to specialists for those medications. This single step all but solved the problem. 

All new patients requesting an appointment were ran through the prescriber’s database. Records were reviewed prior to scheduling. Those who did come in on chronic narcotics were evaluated. I counseled them on non-narcotic therapies, which were almost universally rejected. I would then refer when testing or records indicated it was appropriate - many came in on opioids without even basic testing to verify diagnoses! There were some appropriately-diagnosed patients who were in too poor of a condition to make the trip to pain management. When appropriate, I placed these patients on pain contracts, documented copiously, and treated them according to guidelines. 

I was able to convince several patients to enter rehab, or to allow me to help them taper off of inappropriate medications. These have proven to be some of my most thankful patients.

If you find yourself in this situation, don’t give up on rural medicine. You are needed out here, and you can have a happy and beneficial practice. Just take control, develop some solid policies, and as one of the best pieces of advice on this reddit said last year, “be fair, be kind, and be appropriate.”
