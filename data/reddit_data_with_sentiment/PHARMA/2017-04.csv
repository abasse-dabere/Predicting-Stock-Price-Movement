medicine,Keeping yourself from being jaded,"So, I work in centralized scheduling and I'm not even sure if this is the place for this. 
I schedule for 200+ clinics and probably like a bazillion providers.  I'm taking calls from patients who refuse to see anyone but their PCP for a case of the sniffles and I'm also talking to people who are patiently calling for the third time in two weeks asking for biopsy results (by the way, they're abnormal, I'm not allowed to tell them or transfer them to the clinic, and I'm not allowed to send the message in EPIC to the clinic as a high priority). 
After just one week of being on the phones full time I feel so discouraged.  I often feel like the contact center management does not have the best interest of the patients in mind.  Clinic Instructions are unclear, we are discouraged from asking questions and often receive different answers to the same question, and the we are not given even five minutes in a given day to get off the phones to bring the confusing instructions to the attention of whoever is supposed to clarify them.  I'm encouraged to empathize with patients, but discouraged from conversing with them or creating any sort of friendly interaction while I'm silently entering their info into Epic.  I have spoken with clinics directly who are expressing their frustrations with the ""one size fits all"" standard clinic instructions not being updated to actually help the clinics.  I think I work for great doctors and an overall charitable organization , and yet I still can't help feeling like I am perpetuating a system that  is compromising the quality of patient care.

medicine,"Why is ""client"" replacing ""patient""?","The steady replacement of ""patient"" with ""client"" irks me for one simple reason. Patient literally means ""sufferer"" in Latin. I think it's important to the whole healthcare industry that we not forget that our primary goal is to ease suffering. ""Client"" is a broader term that carries the same implications of an unequal server-to-served relationship, but is neutral on why the service is being sought. To me, it's a term that belongs in business, law, and IT, but not healthcare.

I see ""client"" now popping up almost everywhere where ""patient"" used to be the preferred term, most noticeably when I'm dealing with paperwork from mental health and long term residential care. But here's the funny thing: ""patient"" still appears to be the preferred term exclusively in outpatient clinics and hospitals when a physician or physician extender, treating a physical problem, is involved in the relationship. (I've even heard social workers involved in hospital discharge planning use ""client"".)

When I've asked coworkers whether I'm going to end up eventually being urged (or mandated) to use the word ""client"", I've been given a flat ""no"" every time. So what's going on here? What is the medico-legal difference in definition of these words, which makes one of them preferred in a narrow set of circumstances, and the other the preferred term in seemingly all others?",104,320,2017-04-02,PHARMA,0.06471246480941772,0.9089232683181763,0.02636425755918026
medicine,Internal Medicine residency outpatient clinics are fueling the hospitalist market,"Background: I am an internist who collaborated with four different internal medicine programs as a chief followed by three years of outpatient primary care clinic. I've discussed this topic with internists from several different programs who have a similar experience. And I'm currently in an oncology fellowship watching the majority of IM residents here saying their career plans are for ""anything but outpatient medicine"".

There are a lot of reasons why internal medicine physicians are leaving primary care practice. I acknowledge that there are many more nuanced reasons why they're going funnelling into hospitalist gigs, changing careers, or retiring early. But I feel that part of the reason why residents are avoiding primary care is due to residency experience itself.

* **Many do not give good continuity for the residents.** There is lip-service given to maintaining a patient panel for the resident, but in reality most of the appointment slots are for patients unknown to the resident. Overbooked patients from other physicians' panels and hospital followups from the inpatient teams take up too much of the residents' slots. The end result is each clinic being filled with H&amp;Ps on new patients that they will likely never see again. They don't get to see how the mundane, admittedly 'unsexy' chronic management choices can benefit their patient later. 

* **Resident clinics are frequently a 'dumping ground'.** Drug-seekers and difficult patients fired from other attendings' clinics eventually filter down to the resident panel where they cannot be fired. Tough patients are a reality for all physicians, but in IM clinics they make a disproportionate large population for residents. Thus outpatient clinics become more about wrangling drama and drug-seeking than satisfying medical care.

* **Outpatient call duties give an overinflated view of 'real world' call burden.** Residents having to cover the clinic outpatient call line tend to receive a large number of outpatient calls on nights and weekends. This can vary widely. A lot of institutions won't have a real nurse triage line (why pay for it if there are residents who can't say no to answering every call) to cover the 90% of things that don't require physician input. Larger programs have a much larger patient base and therefore a larger patient population relying on a single physician for coverage. Residents fear that going into outpatient primary care will lead to nights and weekends that are rarely truly free. While each community practice is unique in how it manages home call, in general it comes with a nurse triage line and a much smaller patient population for the single physician to cover on call nights.

* **There's now an outlet, besides subspecialization, for IM residents afraid of outpatient primary care.** This is not a problem, per se, but just a reality that hospitalist positions create. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a indictment against the hospitalist movement. Hospitalists add quality to inpatient systems. But residents now have an option #3 to avoid what they perceive as the misery of outpatient clinics. And that option #3 is in a hiring boom.

I spent three years in outpatient medicine and loved it despite the fact I loathed outpatient care in my residency. I'm saddened that most residents I talk to don't get a good view of what outpatient medicine can be. Their only satisfying work comes from inpatient work, and I can understand that. Inpatient care has excitement, faster conclusions (pneumonia fixed! now go home), and the ability to leave work at work. Outpatient care is more nuanced in the satisfaction is brings to physicians: forming longer term relationships, building the rapport necessary to help patients make the right decisions, and the satisfaction of knowing you've improved someone's long term quality of life. 

I'm curious about how your experiences in training, good or bad, compare with this and how your career path was affected by it. Are there any residencies that effectively combat this stereotype?",51,170,2017-04-02,PHARMA,0.1125822439789772,0.864527702331543,0.022890077903866768
medicine,Patient Calls - a right of modern health care or a sinkhole for doctor's rights and free time,"It seems to me that patients in modern America feel that their doctor needs to be available to answer their questions at a moment's notice.  As much as I care about my patients and would like to make this a reality for them, it also seems unfair to outpatient doctors.  I spend easily 70-80 hours per week working just to handle the patients directly in front of me.  In addition I am expected to spend my free time handling patient calls as needed, which involves talking with a patient on the phone (for often unforeseeable lengths of time) for questions which may or may not be related to my prior encounters with them, providing medical advice, and potentially ordering tests or medications, all without any system in place to bill for this time.  Furthermore, if I misstep on the call I could potentially be exposing myself to liability.  

On the flip side, it also seems wrong for patient's not to be able to turn to their doctor for advice when they need it just because they can't fit in a clinic appointment.

As a resident considering inpatient versus outpatient career paths this is one huge stain against outpatient medicine for me; one visit and I feel like the patient now owns my free time.  Perhaps I'm just a grumpy jaded resident blowing this issue out of proportion, but it does seem likely to be a persistent issue as an outpatient doctor.  

Just curious if anyone has pondered this before and had any deep thoughts or pearls of wisdom on the topic.  Is this really unfair or am I just feeling overly entitled to my free time?  Perhaps for practicing outpatient doctors this is not a big deal?  Anyone work out a system for handling this efficiently?

medicine,Finding a critical lab value for a test that wasn't ordered,"I've been thinking about this since it happened and still don't know what the correct course if action was. I am a medical laboratory scientist and was working in the chemistry department when our instrument was a reading a specimen as grossly hemolyized on multiple recollects when came from both an A-line and peripheral stick. I eventually took a look at the specimen and it looked to me that it may have actually been Myoglibin interference, not hemolysis so I ran a Myoglibin on it which came out to be &gt;700. The patient had cmps ran the past 4 days that didn't read as hemolyized with K results that were all similar to this last specimen making me believe that the specimen wasn't hemolyized. So I called the floor and told the nurse that I did not believe the specimen was actually hemolyized but it appeared that it had very high Myoglibin. I had to be vague as we are not allowed to give any kind of results on tests that are not ordered but I tried to make it obvious that a Myoglibin should be ordered.

medicine,Government-Run health care - is the VA a window into what this might look like?,"Does a nation-wide single payer primarily government-run health care system begin to look like the VA?  If so, that certainly doesn't sound like a health care utopia and gives me reservations about the idea that a purely government run system could work well. 

From my VA experience, during weekends your patients are more likely to get the care they need in the middle of a desert than in a VA hospital, you need 10 logins that require 15 minutes of time to accomplish even the most basic tasks in CPRS, and it there are usually not nearly as many services available. 

On the other hand, for all the nonsense inherent in the VA system it does a good job of having a charting system focused on communication between providers rather than on billing (though it hasn't discovered advanced technological features like bold text), and it does serve as a nice safety net for vets with well defined services and less insurance battle. Overall, it does seem to be effective though with considerable flaws.  Of course, the same could be said of our system outside the VA. 

Is the VA a marker that our government might suck at running health care?  Or does this mean the government might be able to build a loosely functional system and we should embrace this?  Or would a national health care program look very different?  Does this overall influence anyone's thoughts on what direction we should take health care reform?

Just curious to hear some wisdom from those who have more experience in this system than myself. 

Also as a disclaimer I'm not trying to be offensive to those who work at a VA just trying to be funny and stimulate some discussion. Let me know if my assessment is off base.

biotech,"As a senior RA in biotech in my late 20's, is it worth it to give up my $70k/year job to go back to school for a PhD for 5-6 years (making a $27k stipend) for higher growth potential?","I am worried that with my MS I'll eventually cap out salary-wise with limited potential as an RA, whereas if I go back to school for a PhD, I could be promoted to scientist/PI and make about 50% more. On one hand, being a PhD student means getting a salary cut from my current ~60k to less than 30k as that's about as much as most PhD stipends pay, and it would be for ~5-6 years. That would mean a vastly reduced quality of life for me (give up car, move in with roommates or home, etc) and possibly need to take out loans to subsidize my income. But the pay off would be greater in the long run. On the other hand, some PhD scientists in industry told me that the RAs, despite making less, have more job security, since we are the ones who actually run the experiments and protocols we are the last to be cut. I can see this holding true, as the PIs at my company simply analyze the data and design the experiments but actually have never touched any of the reagents or apparatuses and such. I'm still sort of young and it's not too late but also having to live with room mates and getting my salary slashed by more than half well into my 30's seems infeasible as I barely have any savings right now. Is growth extremely limited for an MS in a biotech/pharma company? I have heard examples of MSs who are extremely experienced being promoted to the rank of scientist/PI on the same standing as a junior employee who holds a PhD, so perhaps with enough experience and merit I can still attain that rank and pay grade later in life with enough hard work and competency?

A 56yo male physician comes to the ED complaining of dizziness, fatigue, and some subjective left leg weakness which appears real, but subtle on neurologic exam. His only other history of note is that he recently returned from Haiti, where he performs an annual medical mission trip to treat Haitians who have little access to medical care. He is admitted to the medicine service for workup.

Physical Exam: Normal except as noted above. Heart and lungs sound good, perhaps some bibasilar crackles but nothing outrageous.

Blood Work: Basic labs are unremarkable except for a serum sodium of 132.

CXR: Normal.

What's your next move, hotshot?

**OK, the guesses seem to be slowing down, so I'm going to add the case conclusion below. Don't read it until you go through the thread responses - there are some great lines of thought there!**

[Seriously, read the thread first!](#s ""This was an extremely challenging case that took almost a week to work up. Like most of you, the medicine team figured his recent subtropical travel, and working among extremely high-risk patients, would make his likely diagnosis infectious. However, the lesions were heterogenous and some have solid components, so radiology had correctly read malignancy as a strong possibility. Lung cancer was strongly considered due to the hyponatremia and crackles, but chest imaging was unrevealing. LP was unhelpful, as were all the serum markers his various doctors could think to send. Ultimately, faced with no other diagnostic prospects, we decided to perform a brain biopsy. Doing a stereotactic needle biopsy of a fluid filled lesion can be tricky - once the needle is in, you generally just get fluid in your needle, which is often non-diagnostic. You have to aspirate all the fluid, which you can send for studies, and then get a bite of the cyst wall for pathology. When I pulled out the cyst wall specimen, it was pretty clearly tumor. This went to pathology for a few days. Final results revealed an adenocarcinoma displaying strong positivity for ER, PR, and bcl-2, and HER-2/neu negative. Male breast cancer. The patient survived approximately 9 months after initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy and whole-brain XRT."")",179,566,2017-04-06,PHARMA,0.057204172015190125,0.9063556790351868,0.036440227180719376

My significant other is a female in medicine. We're both in residency and apart from the common gripes we have about residency, she gets things like... 

*going to a male patients room to examine him. ""I told you not to wake me unless you had my dinner tray?"" 

""Are you the cleaning lady?""

""Are you my nurse?"" 

Despite her wearing a white coat... introducing herself as doctor... doesn't matter. But, what I found most surprising was the hostility of nurses. It so happens that my SO is a former nurse before going to medical school.

Naturally, this poses some unique challenges and opportunities/perspective. 

The part that infuriates me... is the nurses who treat female residents or residents in general poorly. Who then say things like... 

""I know that we (nurses) can do medicine, because we know more than you a lot of the time.""

Or even worse... questioning the management decision being made by the female resident. I've gotten a call before and I gave the exact same answer as the female resident. Nurse goes ""oh, just making sure! Heehehe""

medicine,"Fellow outpatient FP and IM providers, what tasks do you delegate to your staff?","I recently came close to a nervous breakdown at work, because I was just so tired of working so hard, but seeing the mountain of work in front of me only grow, and facing a daily onslaught of patients and fellow employees annoyed at me for things undone. Our office manager (an experienced nurse and very people-smart woman) had a serious chat with me, and it came to her attention that I'm personally handling a lot of nuts-and-bolts tasks on my job that all the other providers at my practice delegate to nursing or clerical staff:

* routine med renewals by e-script
* prior authorizations
* paperwork for durable medical equipment
* legal forms
* calling patients about normal labs and imaging
* researching what the submitter of an unusual or unprecedented form for me to fill out wants exactly from me
* checking if routine screening or monitoring labs are up to date

I'm a highly self-reliant person, who's been faulted many times for ""trying to do it all"", long before I got into medicine. I don't easily trust people to do things for me and I have a hard time accepting favors. I try very hard not to be a borrower or a buck passer -- when a task is put in front of me, my knee jerk reaction is to just take it on myself and ask nobody for help. Less charitable people have described me as ""a control freak"" or ""not a team player"". I never scored well on Systems-Based Practice, and I'll readily admit that managing human resources is not a talent of mine.

Residency did a piss poor job teaching me what nuts and bolts tasks of outpatient medical practice ought to be farmed out to supporting staff, versus done by the doctor. I was expected to do everything, both as a way to learn how the healthcare system works, and part of the (despicable, IMHO) boot camp culture of ""I can always do more"". Whenever I would ask my attendings, no matter how un-whining-ly, how much more I had to do or whether or not something was my responsibility or someone else's, I'd invariably get rebuked for even daring to ask, for breaking the polite fiction that residents are always happy to do more. So you could say I was conditioned not to delegate, but to put nose to grindstone and just do it.

It all makes sense now. For my first year as an attending, I've been taking on far too much. All of the items in my bullet list above are tasks my practice *would prefer* I farm out to support staff. Doesn't help that nobody ever told me this, nor that my nurse (medical assistant, actually) is brand spanking new too.

medicine,Patients blaming you for providing bad news,"Curious how other providers have dealt with patients who are rude after you tell them bad news with a serious diagnosis.

For both patient privacy and my own anonymity I'll be somewhat vague in the details.

I'm consulted in the ED for a patient with a pelvic mass, highly suspicious of malignancy. She had passed a large amount of tissue vaginally, but path was pending. She immediately asks if I think she has cancer. I tell her we wont know until we've done a physical exam and have the results from pathology. I complete my exam, and I tell her (paraphrasing), ""My concern is that given your symptoms and your age, there is a very real possibility this could be cancer. We won't know until the pathologist can look at it under a microscope though. I cannot tell you if it is or is not cancer at this moment, so until we know it is reasonable to stay cautiously optimistic.""

I felt it was my obligation that at the time of my encounter with her, that if on my differential dx malignancy was high, I was obligated to tell her it was a possibility. And by high on my differential I mean it was almost certain. In some ways I felt by saying that she could be cautiously optimistic was almost giving false hope. 

At any rate, to conclude the story. I had to call her to give her the final path diagnosis (it was a rare dx so it took a while and she was discharged before it was finalized but the prelim was that it was some type of sarcoma). She tells me, ""Oh I thought you were calling to apologize. You told me 'based on my exam, you have cancer.' I cannot BELIEVE you said that to me without knowing what the tissue sample was"" .... Ok firstly, no I would have never EVER said that, no one would say that. In fact I specifically said the opposite. I responded with, ""I apologize if there was a miscommunication or misunderstanding. I do hope of course you have the best possible outcome with your future care. I believe it is my moral and ethical obligation however that if I strongly suspect cancer, I cannot withhold that information from you.""

She was not pleased with that response either. She then goes on to tell me that she told my other colleagues and the RNs that my informing her of that before I had the pathology showed I have a terrible bedside manner. I personally feel like I was just the bearer of bad news and when someone hears the word ""cancer"" they cannot hear anything else. This sort of hit me hard because I actually felt like I had been very compassionate during our encounter and here she is saying the opposite. 

Have other peeps of Meddit had to deal with similar situations? I get it, sometimes patients simply cannot be pleased or they are receiving very bad news so you are the easiest person to lash out at. Still it is not a pleasant experience.",67,113,2017-04-08,PHARMA,0.13209033012390137,0.8412015438079834,0.026708124205470085

Recent graduate surveys have indicated that only 10% of Australian interns are primarily interested in becoming a GP. This indicates that somewhere in their training they give up on pursuing an alternative specialty - likely because the path to the most desired specialties are incredibly competitive and can take years just to start the training program. 

So onto my question, why is it that the US system can function with such a small percentage of PCPs? Are problems like mildly elevated BP/Cholesterol managed by a cardiologist instead?

pharmacy,US PBM's Claw-back (DIR Fees),"So we are a small town pharmacy and we do most of our own checks and balances, in fact we do it as often as possible because we like to know where and when stuff gets done. We've been noticing a trend (slight at first) with our reconciliations from major PBMs and their transaction fees.

So here is the gist, say you have a claim for an RX approved to your pharmacy with a reimbursement of $100.00. Now this is very typical in claims, it'll take anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 weeks to see this claim through, with it finally hitting your bank account. In this case though, we do receive a check, but its for less than the approved amount, ie..$97.00 to $98.00. One may think, well that's 1 to 2 dollars, multiply that with at least a hundred scripts a day (mind you we are a small pharmacy), it all adds up. Now this fee, is disguised in something called DIR (Direct and Indirect Renumeration) fees, along with additional transaction fees, adjustments and whatever else they want to throw in after the fact. We are already trying to balance and keep our pharmacy open and running for our town, mostly older folks whom have to travel at least 30 minutes to get to the next nearest pharmacy for regular prescriptions. We are the only pharmacy within 3 hours that do compounding, we do oxygen, we do footwear (diabetic), we do medicare DME billing, we deliver and we do our best every day of our lives. We are getting extorted out of our honestly earned money. 

The thing is its not just small town pharmacies that get the short end of the stick. Its all pharmacies, your neighborhood pharmacies, chain pharmacies, and they are all losing money they need to stay alive. Now there are links to actual bills and how to end this corruption. And if you value having your local pharmacy and not having to go to a mail order pharmacy for your much needed antibiotics or breathing treatments and being able afford your medications, please look into letting your congressman know about this. Please let everyone you know, know about this. I'll add in some links to better explain or further explain, but this is something that's been going on and its only getting worse everyday.

Our pharmacy started seeing fees around 2015, so in that year $12,000.00 in these fees, 2016 had $18,000.00 and just with the first quarter of 2017 we are projecting a 44% increase of these same fees this year. It started with 1 PBM finding this loophole and now its going everywhere. Now there is a bill going around but its not very well known. I'll include some links for you. Please feel free to ask any question.

Thanks,

medicine,"I think I came up with a better way to immobilize unilateral eye injuries, what do you think of it?","So, I am a basic paramedic as well as an industrial first aid attendant, when a patient has an eye injury to 1 eye , there is a dilemma for the first aider, either cover the good eye or leave it uncovered, if the good (uninjured) eye is also covered, the patient will not look around, and that will keep the injured eye more steady (because the eyes always move in pairs) but covering both eyes can send a patient in even worst panic, especially when the pain is from an eye injury, so I was thinking,
Cover the injured eye as recommended, and then, take a plastic cup, make a hole (about half inch diameter) in the bottom of the cup, place the cup with the hole , upsidedown, over the good eye, now the patient can see the world through the hole and relax a little better, AND, because the patient WANTS to see the world from that hole, the patient will automatically keep their eyes steady and pointed forward, because that's the only way they have to look through the hole.

Is this technique already known? Do you think I am onto something?

DIAGNOSIS? Does your diagnosis change compared to Part 1?

-----

**Thanks for your patience. I was pretty busy today. Here are my thoughts on this case.**

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

**Diagnosis and Teaching Point**

- Diagnosis: Newborn: Lobar holoprosencephaly + hydrocephalus (probably from congenital aqueductal stenosis). 11 y/o: same as above; hydrocephalus status post ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS).

- Teaching Point: The classic differential for enlarged CSF space + abnormal brain hemispheres is HHH: hydrocephalus, hydranencephaly, and holoprosencephaly; and you're supposed to narrow it down to 1 of those 3. In this case, Occam's razor failed, and we actually have TWO separate diagnoses (although they are related). I suspect this is where some of you got confused, and that is why I wanted to share this case.

&gt; ""It looks like hydranencephaly? But there is more cerebral rim than I'd expect on the followup images, so I'm not sure.""

**Approach to this Case**

[2 Annotated](http://imgur.com/L5WwnaF): 

**1)** Note the presence of the flow void of a single anterior cerebral artery (aka ""azygos ACA"") where there should two ACAs. This can be seen in isolation as a variant anatomy, but it is highly associated with fusion abnormalities of the brain (holoprosencephaly). 

**2)** Note the presence of a midline falx both anteriorly and posteriorly. This effectively rules out the severe forms of holoprosencephaly (aprosencephaly, atelencephaly) that have absent falx as well as the moderate-severe form of semilobar holoproscenphaly that has absence of the anterior falx. We're left with the lobar type, the middle interhemispheric variant / syntelencephaly, minimal holoprosencephaly, and microform holoprosencephaly. We will narrow it down even further later on. I noticed that u/Porencephaly called this case semilobar - that's okay. It doesn't matter too much between ""severe"" lobar or ""mild"" semilobar as far as I understand it. In real life, holoprosencephaly is a smooth spectrum of varying severity, and the individual ""types"" should be thought of as sign posts or distance markers rather than absolutes. 

**3)** The ventricles are not well defined. There should be a lateral ventricle in either hemisphere separated from each other superiorly by intervening brain material. Instead, there is this midline enlarged CSF space. Additionally, this CSF space is very large and is pushing out and squeezing the cerebral cortex out. The cortex looks plastered against the skull. This is consistent with hydrocephalus. Those of you who suggested lissencephaly - good thought! as that never even crossed my mind. On the other hand, going down the path of lissencephaly means that you missed the hydrocephalus that requires an urgent surgical procedure. Just search ""lissencephaly"" on google and compare the ventricle size on the examples to this case's BULGING CSF space.

**4)** Now let's look at the cortex. The presence of both cerebral hemispheres already rules out hydranencephaly - a condition of in utero bilateral ICA occlusion -&gt; destruction/near absence of both cerebral hemispheres, leaving only the posterior circulation brain (broadly, parts of the occipital lobe + cerebellum + brainstem, etc) in place. 

[3 Annotated](http://imgur.com/rkfqqVt): 

The peanut-shaped highlight shows partial fusion of bilateral thalami, a finding seen in either lobar or semilobar holoprosencephaly. In order to not write an even larger wall of text, we can, with some other findings, discard the milder forms of holoprosencephaly to arrive at our final diagnosis of lobar holoprosencephaly + hydrocephalus. Anything further I show is just more supporting evidence and points of interest in this case.

[5 Annotated](http://imgur.com/o7A7J4c): 

**1)** Enlarged ""3rd"" ventricle that is obviously communicating with...

**2)** The dorsal interhemispheric cyst.

**3)** The 4th ventricle is not dilated suggesting the ventricular obstruction is occurring between the 3rd ventricle and 4th. This is why my personal opinion is that this is probably also congenital aqueductal stenosis as the cause of the hydrocephalus. Nowadays we have fancy MRI sequences to evaluate for flow through the aqueduct (T2 CUBE, T2 FIESTA), but they probably weren't invented 11 years ago.

**4)** Incidentally noted ""posterior pituitary bright spot,"" a normal structure that is also at its normal location. An ectopic pituitary gland might have the bright spot elsewhere.

**5)** Incidentally noted common MRI artifacts, probably motion versus [Gibbs truncation artifact](http://mri-q.com/gibbs-artifact.html).

[6 Annotated](http://imgur.com/hiB0M77): 

**1)** 11 years later, we still see the dorsal interhemispheric cyst as expected, but the massive enlargement of this space (ie. hydrocephalus) is gone.

**2)** The resolved hydrocephalus is thanks to the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS), which you can see the tip is within the dorsal cyst.

[7 Annotated](http://imgur.com/co88SK8): 

11 years later, and the thalami are still partially fused, as expected.

[8 Annotated](http://imgur.com/JlVppIP):

**1)** A coronal look at the fused thalami.

**2)** A coronal look at where the ventricles would be. There is clearly no septum pellucidum dividing the left and right lateral ventricles. In this case, the lateral ventricles are fused together and fused to the 3rd ventricle and also fused to the dorsal cyst above.

**3)** A coronal look at the dorsal interhemispheric cyst.

**4)** The shape of the hemispheres in holoprosencephaly can be described as ball-shaped (the hemispheres completely surround the dorsal interhemispheric cyst), cup-shaped (like this case), and pancake-shaped (flat - might get mistaken for hydranencephaly?)

**5)** This is the control device for the VP shunt.

medicine,"I'm a volunteer at a local hospital working in the Emergency Department. My main role is to talk the patients and family members that are with them. What are some conversation starters other than ""How are you doing?""","I hope this is the appropriate subreddit.

My main role is to make sure the patients are doing okay and sometimes chat about various things and lend a helping hand to let the nurses know if the patient need assistance, etc.

Sometimes I will start off by introducing myself to the patients family member as a volunteer, and ask if I can get them some water and if there is anything I can do for them.

medicine,Acute hemorrhage and subsequent drop in H/H- when would you see it?,"Okay, so from my understanding, H/H are relative values. They're concentrations. So a pateint may be hemoconcentrated or hemodiluted from free water loss or retention. 

My question is this, and it stems from a recent scenario at my previous hospital. If a patient has an acute blood loss, it would take some time for the blood loss to reflect as a drop in H/H, right? The blood that's in the body is the same concentration, assuming you haven't replaced the volume loss with some sort of fluids. 

The scenario was this- I had a post surgical patient that for some reason we were concerned had been acutely bleeding into his abdomen over the last hour or so. The fellow ordered an H/H to be done right then, and was reassured when it was stable from that morning. However, this didn't make much sense to me, because if we hadn't replaced any significant volume, and the patient lost a liter or so of blood into the abdomen, the H/H would stay stable as it's the same relative concentration of hemoglobin. Or is this a wrong assumption? 

My question is how long would it take, after an acute hemorrhage (and assuming relative hemodynamic stability), to see a drop in H/H?",46,36,2017-04-13,PHARMA,0.2607575058937073,0.7127424478530884,0.026499997824430466

I'm also really unhappy with my telescoping Babinski -- the swivel head keeps getting loose and then it's hard to use.  I've always used a telescoping Babinski to fit in my purse, but now that I have a doctor's bag, I'm considering switching to a Queen Square.  Anyone have a favorite reflex hammer?

pharmacy,"% ethanol in pediatric patients? for instance, ferrous sulfate?","Had a colleague pharmacist inquire about the use of ethanol in pediatric patients, and trying to look into it more myself. For instance, selecting ferrous sulfate supplement drops for a pediatric patient.

Are there any guidelines or data that talk about the use of alcohol containing medications for pediatrics? in general, how safe are elixir for pediatric patients in general?

it seems ferrous sulfate 15 mg iron (75 mg)/mL oral drops comes in 0.2% alcohol in a bottle, sometimes even none. ""It has specific labeling for use in children younger than 4""

but ferrous sulfate ferrous sulfate 220 mg (44 mg iron)/5 mL has 5% of alcohol in a bottle. ""This has no specific age labeling for young patients"" 

Is pediatric age something to consider when choosing the type strength /manufacturer/alcohol content of ferrous sulfate? If the doctor write the ferrous sulfate 220 mg (44 mg iron)/5 mL strength for a pediatric patient, would that warrant a call to change it?

medicine,A message to medical students from a resident,"In light of a recent post I figured I'd share my own perspective as a resident to any medical students browsing.

I will treat you with professionalism. I will treat you as a future physician knowing that your experiences with my clerkship (even if you don't choose my/thebest specialty) will be valuable and formative. I will respect that your time commitments are different than my own and send you home to study if there is no extra learning to be had.

 If you make a mistake or commit a faux pas, I will approach you directly and discreetly to offer a constructive criticism. I will not hold your first mistakes against you, unless they are obviously malevolent or harmful. We will all make mistakes, sometimes serious ones, and learning how to give and receive feedback to improve as clinicians is a critical part of our learning. 

I will remember what it was like to be a medical student; the anxieties related to subjective review from residents and attending, the yearly, growing pressure created by board and shelf exams, the often trivial busy work your administrators (far removed from clinical practice) place on your shoulders. 

You will have an opportunity to see a very special aspect of medicine, possibly for the only time in your career. I will do my best to expose you to a variety of cases. If you express interest in a different specialty, I'll try to give you opportunities to see patients that are specifically related to that field in addition to some of the bread-and-butter cases that will help you succeed on the course. I'll take time to teach. I'll expect you to teach a little, too, but focus on salient details. 

I'll give you opportunities to step outside of your comfort zone. I'll have you see patients alone (if appropriate) and then see them with you occasionally. I'll practice your presentation skills and let you have an opportunity to discuss patients with attendings. I'll try to let you attempt procedures if the intern doesn't need the experience first. 

I'll treat you the way I would have hoped to be treated as a student and enjoy the value in helping a young doctor develop into a thoughtful, well-prepared resident.",109,454,2017-04-16,PHARMA,0.06291735917329788,0.9099920392036438,0.027090566232800484

medicine,Do any other experienced (10 years+) medical professionals still encounter cases that devastate you emotionally?,"We've all heard the cliche that doctors (and nurses, paramedics, etc) eventually reach a point where they are no longer emotionally attached to their patients because the daily tragedies become routine.

Sometimes, I find myself slipping into this mentality, but after almost two decades of working in the ER, I still encounter cases that just devastate me. Two days ago, a 9 year old boy came by ambulance after a suicide attempt. He tried to cut his wrists using his dad's razor. I was fine for the rest of the day, but as soon as I got home and sat down on the couch I just broke down. I've seen young kids and teenagers attempt suicide before, but never a child that young. Thankfully the cuts weren't very deep (I haven't taken a look at the psych eval (he wasn't my patient), but I assume that it wasn't a genuine attempt) and he should be discharged today, but still.

I don't know if it was the straw on the camel's back (it was a particularly rough day with a lot of serious cases), or if I couldn't avoid the obvious fact that he's the same age as my own girl, but I just could not stop crying for almost an hour after I got home.

I haven't cried about a patient in probably three or four years, but this case broke me, and he wasn't even my patient.

I'm not really looking for advice or anything (though I would appreciate it if some was offered). I suppose I just wanted to talk about this with people who understand what it's like to work in environments like these.",53,181,2017-04-19,PHARMA,0.1456407904624939,0.825457751750946,0.028901465237140656

medicine,Strange seizure presentation,"Hey meddit, I'm an EMT-B and I wanted to see if I could attempt to find some causation to the presentation of a particular patient. 

Last night we had a patient (twice) who suffered a witnessed global tonic clinic seizure. Patient was a 31 y/o female, with no hx of any seizure or neuro disorders. The first one occurred while she was at work. Coworkers reported that it lasted approx. 2 minutes and when we arrived on scene the patient was A&amp;Ox3 and vitals were unremarkable. Upon questioning she didn't recall the incident. But when asked about what she remembered prior to, she answered inappropriately and tried to explain to us subjects and predicates-the pt is an English tutor-and also didn't believe us or her coworkers when we said she had a seizure. She wanted to RMA, but given her presentation, neither us or ALS were comfortable doing so. We were on scene for about 30 minutes trying to convince her. She wanted to refuse because she ""had too much work to do."" Her SO was contacted, and when he spoke to her he reported that her behavior was not her baseline normal. There were no changes in her neuro status during transport. 

The second time was when we were returning to quarters several hours later. We were flagged down by another vehicle, and when I looked over I saw the passenger actively seizing. We stopped and I noticed that it was the same patient as before. She appeared to be post-ictal for less than five minutes and then was completely alert. Again she didn't believe that she had a seizure, and was also answering questions inappropriately and tangentially, same as before. We found out from the patient's SO who was in the vehicle with her that she left the hospital AMA. Again vitals were unremarkable. There were no changes in her neurological status during transport. 

I don't really know what to make of her post seizure presentation. I've seen plenty of patient who suffer a seizure and appear confused, but not to the extent of this patient. I was talking to my partner about it and we thought it could be due to a metabolic condition or a mass of some kind.

medicine,Validating or confirming the doctor's note -- questions on protocol and ethics.,"Hello /r/medicine --

Hopefully not too far off topic or unwelcome, but this seemed like the best place to post and the best group from which to solicit advice if you'll entertain the question .. 

I work as a mechanical engineering prof at a technical school in Canada. We have problems with cheating and academic misconduct, as do all engineering schools, but have recently seen a spike in students using doctor's notes to be excused from exams or other assignments.  Typically, we regard a note as something not to be questioned -- which will surely make this community happy -- but in discussing the problem as a faculty, we are finding that as a group, some of the ailments or excuses (as described by the medical professional) are beginning to look a bit suspect.

Examples include 'Student developed severe panic attacks and could not recollect what he studied, and so was not able to attend today's exam' - 'Student has developed a tongue infection and will be unable to participate in the presentation' and so on. Examples range from the vaguely plausable to the absurd. 

The point was raised that (in Canada) Physicians are able to bill for notes -- they are also advocates for the patient, and not necessarily for academic integrity or ethical considerations within our institution. They may also be morally or ethically flexible to the degree to which they will provide a note for whatever needs to be covered.

So, my question is this: ***What is the most respectful way to confirm a note with a physician and verify that the condition was severe enough to miss an examination?*** 

As an extension to this -- if we feel the doctor has acted unethically in providing the note, is there a mechanism through which we can bring the issue up with a governing or licensing body?

medicine,What are my privacy rights regarding my medical records/information?,"EDIT: So sorry about this, but I forgot to mention that this is in Australia. Not the US. I was just so upset that I didn't think that laws like this would vary much. I assumed since Australia is a developed country it wouldn't be all that different...

Greetings, this question is directed to mainly medical professionals who can give me a clear answer as to where the boundaries are set with my medical records. (I wasn't getting detailed/factual responses on the r/advice subreddit so I thought I'd try my luck here)

My partner is a Nurse, and recently I had found he had gotten the medical records of a family member. Keep in mind that this family member was not his patient, in fact, they had never met. He was simply looking up these records for his own interest and curiosity. After learning this, I became extremely upset since I felt this was a violation of patient confidentiality. He was not given permission nor authorised to pull up those records and the whole situation just feels wrong. Once I confronted him, he stated things like:

""You know I can literally look up any person who has been to a public or private hospital and see their history right?""

and ""I can read any patients info I want I literally just need to pick it up and open it. I wont be fired I wont be reprimanded because im a nurse and im Authorised by the NMBA to view medical records.""

and ""Guess what, it happens 1000 times a day. No you dont get fired. No one cares if you're a nurse or doctor looking up medical records. you may not LIKE it but at the end of the day thats the way it is. deal with it.""

Those are exact quotes of some of the things he said in response to my confrontation. I would like to know if there is any truth behind those statements and am I really unable to do anything about him accessing this information? As things started to get heated in the argument, he left one more message; ""Do you want me to look yours up tonight? You aren't curious if the nurses/doctors called you a brat or left some snide comment in your progress notes?""

At this current point in time I am just extremely uncomfortable with the whole situation and I feel like there has to be some boundaries. I am NOT okay with my partner accessing my medical records, nor have I given him permission to do so. Is there really nothing I am able to do? I am aware he can obviously view medical records for patients he is treating, but is it still okay if the records he is looking up is purely for his own amusement with malicious intent?",41,42,2017-04-19,PHARMA,0.11769013106822968,0.8605197668075562,0.021790124475955963

We had a difficult care with a bad result that was particularly traumatic for some team members. As a result, the nursing administration called for a formal debriefing and offered counseling to all of the team members (of note, most team members declined participation).

medicine,Quitting residency,"Edit : thank you everybody for the advices/opinions on the matter. I will read them all and try to sort my thoughts out. It is very appreciated.


Need advice on something I have been considering for a while now.

I realized during M4 that medicine wasn't for me at all. I am now in family medicine and graduating in December 2018. I have been quite miserable for the last year even though I optimize my social life and practice sports I enjoy the most to keep my mental health in check. However, I think about quitting residency everyday and it's starting to weigh heavy on my shoulders. I feel empty inside and it is hard to feel like that as I was a energetic and fun guy a couple of years ago.

The thing is I have over 60k in debt and I am not sure if it's possible to enjoy life trying to pay back the loans having a normal job (40-50k / year).

Sorry for the sad post. I need to vent I guess, my friends and family feel pretty helpless. I thought I'd ask neutral people who went through similar things or something.",137,127,2017-04-23,PHARMA,0.17570078372955322,0.7945813536643982,0.02971787191927433

medicine,Why Plavix for stroke and why lovenox for PE/DVT,"I'm just wondering why we do that. I understand that both have different mechanisms. 

Is there a specific mechanism of why one is better for each respective disease? Maybe because in persistent afib or valvular disease the mechanical events causes platelet aggregation thus an anti platelet is more appropriate and effective? 

What about DVT/PE. A PE is usually from a thrombotic emboli and DVT perhaps from just blood stasis and hypercoaguability states causing an embolic event thus the anti coagulation is more effective? 

Interestingly, both are approved for ACS according to epocrates. 

Would like a more sophisticated and concrete evidenced based mechanism explanation if possible rather than my theory-craft.

medicine,Anticoagulation in this scenario,"Good evening,

PA here. I had a patient who presented after having 2 weeks of black stool. He hadn't slept in 2 weeks and was complaining of sob and cough. Cxr by radiologist showed lll pneumonia and fluid overload and he was started on rocephin and levoquin by the NP before me. Bnp &gt; 900. H/h at that time was 14/41. The next am his h/h was 14/39 after receiving NS 1250 total, output 2500 after receiving lasix 20mg for the seemingly new onset chf. Facility did not have echo on the weekends. Patient developed a fib with rvr over night that did not respond to labetalol 5 or diltiazem 5. His bp could not handle another diltiazem 5. 

Since our low acuity facility does not have consultants, nor digoxin, I put in the transfer for a higher level acuity to facility with a cardio/has other antirhythmics. Before hand, I did a hemoccult, which is negative, and h/h 14/39 as previously stated.

(Patient is 83, htn, hx of tia. Also presenting with chf picture. So chads2 or cha2ds2vasc is 4-5.) since I ruled pretty much ruled out gi bleed and h/h stable, I anticoagulated lovenox 1mg/kg and initiated transfer. 

The transfer doc berated me for doing anticoagulation. Her reasoning? His long term risk for stroke does not warrant need for anticoagulation.

My question. I don't understand. How chads score, whether the old score or the newer, shows a score &gt;/=4 which warrants anticoagulation and his gi losses were ruled out. Please admonish me or confirm that I did appropriately per guideline.

Thanks

Edit: all of the guidelines I have researched suggest anticoagulation long term is needed rather than discussing short term need. However, since his chads score is &gt;/=4 i interpret that to mean he needs anticoagulation long term and thus the short term was called for since his short term risk was ruled out with hemoccult/stable h/h.

Edit: since a few people have questions, I'll change some of my post. The patient also presented with confusion, prompting family to bring him in. Ct head neg and no focal deficits. Sodium found to be 122, chloride 90. Patient was on hctz at home. Exam did find a wet chest consistent with the fluid overload. He was not septic. ns 50ml/hr was started the night before for the hyponatremia, and lasix added for fluid overload. His confusion had resolved the next day, and his sodium improved to 126. I agree about the abx issue, which is why I put in that these meds were started by the NP rather than myself. Most people are agreeing that anticoagulation is not warranted. I appreciate everyone's response. Thanks!

medicine,Atul Gawande - Meddit's Thoughts,"Hi Meddit,

I've been a long time lurker of this subreddit and others like /r/nursing. I really enjoy discussion and opinions people have to share on the range of topics posted. I was recently introduced to Atul Gawande and upon reading his background was impressed with what he has done so far in his career.  I was hoping to hear some of the thoughts Meddit and the overall medical community has on Dr. Gawande and also if you have read any of his publications. 

If you have read any of his publications, do you think they are books worth reading, and what stood out to you after finishing them? 

Thanks for the insight!",42,40,2017-04-30,PHARMA,0.02298845164477825,0.9221265316009521,0.054885078221559525
