Health,"You know more than me, could I be lactose intolerant?","For a long time now I have started to realize that food (and sometimes drinks) pass through me very quickly. For example, 5-10 minutes ago I started eating a nice bowl of queso and now I am sitting on the toilet trying to figure out why I have instant diarrhea. It's not always cheesy stuff tho, I will start to watch if cheese or dairy irritates it but in general food passes through me very quickly and upsets my stomach until I have a chance to relieve myself. 

Also, I have noticed it is normally my first meal of the day, especially if it is a big meal after not eating before hand. For example, I will wake up at 10 and not eat breakfast or lunch because I'm not that hungry, but by 5pm I'll be ready for a big dinner, the dinner will set my stomach into diarrhea overload mode.

Health,Follow up: I have now *mostly* beaten my severe-Eczema condition from the last 11 months. It's restored my life back.,"Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/lgkiw/got_sent_home_from_work_today_as_my_eczema_is_now/

This condition ended up lasting till around early August (started around Sept, really kicked in after Dec). It would cycle so much into bad and sort-of-tolerable times. My skin all over was always red, my hands would have 10-30 tiny seeping cuts all over, my skin was flaking so much that I could never wake up peacefully - just consistent pain. Sometimes if I woke up my whole body was shedding and seeping and I'd have to turn up late to work after a shower and care to sort myself out.

I could literally go on for days and days about how my condition replaced my happy life with suffering. And it makes you sleep 14 hour days :(

BUT I can basically say, for my specific situation, that it ended up being a fairly bad staph infection. One I'm still on antibiotics for now. One thing I learned about skin reactions is that we are in contact with a massively diverse world and any one of those variables can be to blame. This actually all happened because of an underlying infection was increasing over the years and a major allergic reaction was the 'bomb' it needed to take over.

I only recently got it sorted after being shifted through the NHS in a series of referrals and catch-up sessions, and as I learned more about how my body reacted to everything I was convinced it was a staph infection and needed further antibiotics.

I can now crash at mates places after a crazy night out. Go to the gym. Appear in work on time. Wear dark-coloured clothing. Feel confident about my appearance. Go on holiday. Wake up early and have a weekend. Enjoy life. Get ready after a shower in 10 minutes. Not carry creams with me all day. Twist and move about. Do the washing up.

The funny thing is that I can't remember how long it's been since my skin has been this good - I think all this time I've been carrying little staph infections for years which allowed them to colonize.

Just thought I'd share a success story out there, because at many times the possibility of recovery seemed bleak, inevitably, with a lot of dermatologic conditions that don't have a miracle cure. But **thank fuck** for medicine. And in one way I'm fortunate that this whole ordeal happened because I'm now almost entirely eczema and infection free (for now!).",19,42,2012-09-02,PHARMA,0.08128440380096436,0.8822718262672424,0.03644372895359993

Health,"I've been dealing with some pretty embarrassing and uncomfortable symptoms for years. In the past 12 months, things have really started to get bad. What's wrong with me?","I'm a generally health-conscious individual. Decent diet, lots of exercise and meditation. I do work hard and am often under a decent amount of stress, but I handle it relatively well. 

I've been experiencing a number of symptoms that I feel like must be related, and I can't figure out what's going on with me. I'm just about at wits end, and so far, no one can figure out what the hell is going on with me! I've been to medical doctors, naturopaths, osteopaths, and still nothing concrete... 

To keep this easy, I've divided my symptoms up into three categories. 

**Do you know what's wrong with me?** 


Gastrointestinal

* Light bleeding after bowel movements
* It hurts if warm water touches my anus in the shower
* Over the past 6+ years, my anus used to push outside my body slightly. This is much like a hemorrhoid, but after a colonscopy it was confirmed that I didn't have any. I was able to get this to stop by changing how I went to the bathroom (specifically, I lean forward in a more squat-like position, which cleared up the issue in a couple of weeks).
* Not long after I changed how I was going to the bathroom, I began to have extreme itchiness in my anus area at times. It's so bad sometimes that I can't sleep. I can only relieve this by applying a small amount of coconut oil or prescription hemorrhoid cream
* Infrequently, this is accompanied with some leakage. When this does happen, it's usually the worst when I sleep

Urinary

* During two time periods (a year apart), I have experienced a frequent urge to urinate and urine leaking after going to the bathroom. I'm currently experiencing this right now, which part of the motivation to post this on reddit
* About 12 months ago, I passed a kidney stone (not long after I experienced the frequent urge to urinate). Most painful experience of my life! Should I be mentally preparing myself to pass another kidney stone soon??

Other possibly related symptoms

* I have psoriasis on both legs on my shins
* I have generally dry skin, especially dandruff
* My dry skin is almost instantly irritated when I drink coffee. It will begin to flake within 10-20 minutes of drinking coffee
* I have been experiencing fatigue for approximately 8 years after returning from a trip to Thailand. I went through thorough blood tests, but never found anything",49,24,2012-09-08,PHARMA,0.13220855593681335,0.8401831388473511,0.027608240023255348

It sounds like there are a few legitimate cases of missed diagnoses, but there's plenty of ""OMG I had a URI and then 3 days after I went to the doctor I ended up developing pneumonia! What an idiot!""

On the flip side, there are several people complaining about too much testing being done, like the guy who had two cystoscopies for what ended up being a benign condition.

Health,"Hey guys, I need some help with my sweat issue...","Okay, so some context. I'm a teenager and at school, and I have a sweat issue. Pretty much, I sweat a lot more than ""normal"" people.

The sweat is all over the body, namely my back, groin, chest and arms (practically the whole body but these spots are the worst). I got rid of my underarm sweat by using Driclor, but the rest of these areas ruin me. I understand that my condition is not as bad as others, for example I'm usually alright in winter, unless a room has ridiculous heating and i'm in pants. Summer, however, is horrible. I'm also really self-conscious about my sweating, and in my school uniform sweat shows. This results in embarrassment for me, and most of the time it's that bad that I try not to engage physically with someone in the event that they might notice. Summer ruins my social life (well, not sure you would call it that, but hey, I have friends I catch up with), and I find myself nervous and anxious around girls because I'm trying to stay constantly hydrated, and therefore I'm focused on that rather than the girls. Moreover, if they notice, then I'm immediately the subject of chatter amongst themselves, or worse, they could mention it in a disgusted tone and there goes all my confidence (I'm not exactly ""attractive"" so I don't need something else to drive the girls away).

The point is, school representative positions are up for grabs (I.e. School Prefect, Head Boys, whatever it is in your area) and I think I have a legitimate chance of securing one of the roles. Problem is, if I'm successful, then I'm now more involved, more noticed and more attention is paid to me. The kicker is in summer, our prefects wear ties (I don't know why), and I live in Australia so the summers are legitimately warm (We're talking 35C+ each day). Now, with no source of air to my chest area (Tie up and shirt tucked in), you can imagine what will happen. I'm seriously afraid of applying for it, for fear of embarrassment and being the subject of remarks. Otherwise, I think I'd handle the responsibilities fine in both summer and winter, but it's just this sweat issue that keeps bugging me. 

My parents and all my teachers are encouraging me to go for it, and I know several of my peers have voted for me. So Reddit, can you help me out? You have no idea how much I would appreciate it.",5,14,2012-09-10,PHARMA,0.10033535212278366,0.8705695271492004,0.029095076024532318

medicine,Have you all ever seen a case where a patient's blood work showed...,"low levels of vitamin D, high levels of calcium, and LOW parathyroid levels?

Update:

First off, I just want to thank everyone who has offered their opinions and advice on this case so far.
 
I am just an MPH student who is shadowing a doctor before I apply to med school, so I only get access to what the doctor deems necessary. Everyone is recommending that the doctor should run extra tests, but this doctor is working at a large university's student health services, so she was limiting the amount of tests she needed run presumably because the student's insurance won't cover everything. However, I could be completely wrong.

So, the second set of blood tests came in, and the calcium is within the high-normal range, PTH is within normal range, and vitamin D is still low. Alright, here are the actual levels by date that I have access to in case anyone is still interested in what is going on:


9/28/11 (This the only lab result from from a year ago that I have access to. Vitamin D, PTH, and TSH were not checked):

* Calcium, Serum - 10.4 (8.7 - 10.2 mg/dL)

9/04/12:

* Calcium, Serum - 12.3 (8.7 - 10.2 mg/dL)
* Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy - 15.9 (30.0 - 100.0 ng/mL)
* TSH - 1.870 (0.450 - 4.500 uIU/mL)
* PTH, Intact - 13 (15 - 65 pg/mL)


9/11/12 (Second set of labs ordered to rule out error, but TSH was not ordered again):

* Calcium, Serum - 10.2 (8.7 - 10.2 mg/dL)
* Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy - 18.3 (30.0 - 100.0 ng/mL)
* PTH, Intact - 23 (15 - 65 pg/mL) 

As for some of the questions you all may have had, here is a little more background I was able to find out:

* The patient saw a cardiologist about the high blood pressure in 2010 and received an Echo
 * Echo showed slight mitral regurgitation and one of the arteries showed signs of slight hardening
* No underlying cause for the high blood pressure was ever determined. Deemed essential hypertension because one of the patient's parents was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 22.

* Patient complained of problems with insomnia over the past 6 months, being tired/sleepy throughout most of the day (possibly due to the insomnia?), problems with memory and concentration, muscle aches, frequent bone pain, excessive sweating, clumsiness, and recent problems with increased urination and slight nausea

* Patient has an involuntary tremor in both hands while at rest and during use of hands

* Patient was also diagnosed with Gilbert's Syndrome (Not sure if relevant)

* Patient is not taking any vitamins/supplements

* Medication currently taking: Losartan Potassium (for hypertension), Amphetamine Salts (for adhd), and Prilosec OTC (for acid reflux)  

I'm sorry that this is all I can provide you with, but unfortunately this is all I have access to. I am trying to avoid sharing any personal identifiable information about the patient, for obvious reasons, but if there is anything you feel I should not be sharing please let me know and I will remove it immediately.

Health,"Not seeking ""advice"" per-se, but no one knows what is wrong with me and I am growing so tired. What do you think it could be, r/Health?","**Notice:** I am very mindful of the whole internet medical advice thing. I'm simply trying to brainstorm with anyone that will join me - especially people that are health/medicine-minded like myself. I'm tired, frustrated, maxed out on my insurance before even seeing a specialist, and just wanting answers. PS: This is long. It's a very detailed timeline of my mystery illness.

My top contenders are *Rheumatoid Arthritis* and *SLE (even though it's never SLE)*.  I have had a lot of exposure to benzene through diesel fuel over the past few months, so *AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia)* is in the back of my mind, too.

Demographically, I'm a 27-year old caucasian female nursing student who is returning for a second BS in Nursing.

**Medical treatment to date:**
8/27 – went to urgent care and saw NP#1. Focused on believing it was tick borne. Labs were ran: CBC w/ diff (low WBC @ 3.9 10^3/mm3), ESR (wnl), Free T4 (wnl), TSH (wnl), Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever IgG/IgM (wnl), Lyme Disease IgG/IgM (wnl), Ehrlichia chaffensis Antibodies (wnl), ANA (wnl), Rheumatoid Factor (wnl)

8/29 – returned to urgent care and saw NP#1 as a follow up to lab work. I told her that was 95% certain that it wasn't tick-borne, but she seemed hyperfocused on this and insisted on Doxycycline. Scheduled me with “family medicine” to see NP#2 on 9/4. Began Doxycycline that night. (Since beginning Doxycycline, the only change that has been noted is the time at which my fever occurs and I have noticed the sores in my mouth.) 

9/4 – Saw NP#2 at Urgent Care. Was driven to the appointment by parents because of a searing migraine and weakness. Spent 10-15 minutes lying down in patient room. Head was very full, pounding. Any shift in movement caused increased pressure. When NP#2 came in and began questioning me on my main symptoms, I found myself unable to speak properly. It was as if the right side of my mouth would not work. It was also difficult for me to explain what was bothering me, perhaps out of fear. Moments after, she began examining me and the left side of my torso felt completely numb. These two events lasted for about 5 minutes.

She suggested a round of prednisone for my joints. She ordered a chest x-ray, TB skin test, HIV, CCP, Pathology smear, Uric Acid, CMP and CBC recheck. Abnormalities were shown on CMP and CBC. All other testing was wnl.

CMP: Na [L] 133 mmol/L (136-145); Cl [L] 97 mmol/L (98-107); Glu [H] 
117 (74-106) *not fasting*; Alb [L] 3.2 g/dL (3.4-5.0); AST [H] 72 U/L (8-42); ALT [H] 67 (30-65)

CBC-Diff: WBC [L] 4.2 10^3/mm3 (5.0-11.0) – 3.9 on 8/27; Ly% [L] 21% (25-35); Ly# [L] 0/9 10^3/mm3 (1.0-4.0); Mo# [L] 0.1 10^3/mm3 (0.2-1.0)

9/6 – Saw PCP/MD. She suspected CMV, as had been her dx by an infectious disease doc after a 14 day fever. Labs were drawn for CMP, CMV and others of which I am unsure.

Overnight, had excruciating headache that kept me awake. Relief came from sitting upright in a chair without moving. Fever involved as well at ~102. No serious fever since that night.

9/9 – started noticing very sharp pain upon movement of my wrists. It doesn't occur all the time, but when it does, causes shooting pains that takes my breath and makes me stop what I'm doing. This has been increasing in severity and makes it more difficult to drive and perform other day to day tasks.

9/10 – Received call from PCP's office. Explained that abnormalities in lab work could be from infection. Did not agree nor disagree with prednisone dosage. (I had called to get her opinion before starting) Placed orders for referrals to Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology. Appt with Infection Diseases – 9/20 @ 9:45 am.

9/11 – Follow up with NP#2 at Urgent Care for lab work. Also began Prednisone 20 mg 2 daily for 3 days, 1 daily for 3 days, ½ tab daily for 4 days. Drew labs to recheck CMP &amp; CBC as well as EBV titer and monospot. CMP, CBC and monospot were normal. The NP also ran a hs-CRP (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) and it came back at **1.3 mg/dL (Normal values are 0.0 - 0.3).**  The CRP suggests inflammation (duh), which could mean RA/SLE (it's never SLE).. but other than that, I'm at a loss. 

Currently, no high fever since 9/7. Sporadic, nighttime low grade fevers &lt;100 accompanied with slight pounding headache.

Any thoughts? I'm tired of all of the unnecessary testing. Lord knows how much I'll be paying out of pocket for the unnecessary labs that have been ran thanks to my craptastic insurance. Aaaaand it's taking its toll on my ability to function at school. Not to mention acquiring a job is impossible right now due to all the fatigue.

Health,I am a 24 year old male who has undergone a total thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer. I have a couple questions and need to vent.,"I've had two surgeries and a radioactive iodine treatment, and I take levothyroxine every morning for life. The first surgery (April '11) was supposed to be a full thyroidectomy and the removal of a couple of tumors. The surgeon ended up severing my left laryngeal nerve, paralysing my left vocal cord, had an on call plastic surgeon repair it, took the tumor and thyroid and closed me up early. 

They led me on for months to believe that the first operation was a success and my throat was looking clear. Then i find out 7 months after the fact that they knew they had left cancerous tissue inside and didn't get it out because of the mishap. So I needed a second surgery. I went under again in April of this year and they finished what they started.

My left vocal cord never healed but my speaking voice returned to near normal. Thing is I used to be a singer and can't really do that anymore. My hair has been thinning out because of the medication and I'm having trouble sleeping at night and keeping weight consistent, despite my thyroid numbers being perfect. It is also hard for me to be super active now with exercise without getting super winded pretty quickly. I've also seen that a side effect is nervousness. I am *always* nervous now. I know it's the medication and it's driving me nuts. 

Now the last few days my prescription has been pending doctors approval. I know I don't need my bloodwork done again because I just had a doctors appointment last month and my numbers were perfect for the second time in a row. Tomorrow will be the fifth day without my meds as I ran out over the weekend and I can already feel the difference. They told me before a few days off wouldn't hurt if it happened, but I'm starting to worry. Im scared of what could happen if I go any longer. My doctors are bad at answering questions. I feel like I shouldn't need doctors approval for a daily non narcotic non stimulant script...unless they need to see me for some reason.

Couple of questions.

*Do I even need this medication?

 I feel different but not really bad since not having it. What would my body do without it? Supposedly it creates the hormones that the thyroid would and an electrical signal to send them where they need to go. 

*I can sue my original surgeon, correct? 

The second surgery was done by a different surgeon. She has never really apologized for what she did because mistakes happen. But now I have a permanent personal injury. 


*Is there a better subreddit for this? 

I know there is a cancer sub but there are far more people here.

Any positive input would be highly appreciated. Thanks /r/health!

medicine,What if a tricorder-like device was invented tomorrow?,"Sorry for turning things into a Star Trek thread but I though it might be an interesting topic for discussion.  What would happen to the practice of medicine if a tricorder (for those not familiar with Star Trek, a portable/bedside medical scanner) was introduced in a widespread fashion?  We'll assume that it can only find things that we can detect now using current radiological techniques, that it can only identify things that medical science is aware of and that it wouldn't formulate a diagnosis, only show the underlying pathology for a doctor to interpret.

Would doctors still continue to take a history and examine their patient in the same way, or would they become far more cursory?  What would be the effect on the doctor-patient relationship?  I'm sure many of you have seen Abraham Verghese's TED talk on the importance of the physical contact during clinical examination?  How much would be lost in this respect?

How would medical education be affected?  Perhaps there would be a lot less time focused on clinical skills and more time on being able to interpret the tricorder's findings and formulate a diagnosis.

* Fix the weird formatting indents when copy-pasting
* Better autosave and less confusing dialog boxes when trying to recover
* Button to clear formatting
* Give me Ctrl-A and Ctrl-P!
* Allow me to look at flowsheet, labs and write my note in the same screen.
* Give me a view to see all the patients I've recently written notes on
* Allow Addendums to add stuff in the appropriate places rather than at the end. 
* Powernotes should let me directly type into the template rather than having to open a new window -- or at least someway to look at flowsheet values without having to close and reopen the text input.
* Better clarification between ""Note Title"" and ""Note Type""...or remove the former.
* ""ALL"" should be ""All not signed"" in the dropdown on the Powernote tab
* Show flowsheet CMPs and CBCs in fishbone form.
* Remove wasted space at the top and bottom
* Use different color for low/high vals - not just red

* in-line spell check with medical dictionary
* keyword search for a patient's notes
* an RSS-like timeline of everything that has been updated for the patient:

Health,"Early 20s, very healthy, but high blood pressure?","23 year old male, 6'2"", 170 lbs. Nonsmoker, rarely drink. I generally eat a very healthy diet. I lift weights 3-4 days/week and do cardio 5-6 days/week. My resting pulse is in the low 50s bpm.

However... I have high blood pressure. It's been this way since I was 14 or 15. Every time I go to the doctor for my annual physical, my blood pressure's around 145-150 / 75-85.

I just bought a home blood pressure monitor and my average reading has been 148/100.

What's the deal? I'm living a healthy lifestyle, I'm at a healthy weight, but I have consistently high blood pressure. Anyone have a similar experience or advice?

Health,"Got salmonella, what's all the fuss about?","I think I got infected by salmonella. 

Yesterday I ate some noodles with a raw egg (something I've done before, but not very often) and it's been 24 hours since. Today I had some bloody stool. I've been googling it and found some symptoms like fatigue, headache, abdominal cramps, fever, nausea and diarrhea, which I don't find so severe as all the ""hype"" around salmonella is all about. Until now I've only experienced light cramps and very light diarrhea, no different from when I've got an upset stomach. 

I read some posts of other redditors who were paralyzed by the constant cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Am I just lucky, or is it still coming? Do I even have salmonella?

And what's the effect of salmonella on gut flora?

medicine,Evaluating medical students...,"I'd like some thoughts on residents evaluating medical students...


I recently worked with a 4th year medical student who is applying to my field. She's not a total idiot, I'm familiar with her board scores and they are decent. The problem is a lack of common sense and general cluelessness about how to get things done. I wouldn't want her to be my co-resident, and she would require lots of training and teaching by attendings to function as an anesthesiology resident because once you're thrown into the OR you have to be able to multi-task like crazy. You know how you look at some people and think ""I wouldn't want them to be my doctor?"" That's her.


Here's my dilemma: my program will rank medical students here highly and if you want to stay here, it usually works out. However, residents who are concerned about a student are able to speak up and that student will not be ranked. There are already some residents in the class below me who are clueless and incompetent and I can see the problems that arise there, they make you nervous and get taken out of difficult cases because you're not sure if you can trust them. On the other hand, she's not a BAD person, just kind of useless. And her being a resident here will have absolutely no effect on me, just on the attendings and her classmates.

Health,"Are there any easy, over the counter ways to prevent or minimize dreaming during sleep?","I tend to have extremely vivid dreams (and nightmares) every night. It's not very easy for me to fall asleep, but once I do it seems that I immediately start dreaming. I'll generally have two or more distinctly different dreams during the night, and I sometimes can remember my first dream while I'm in my second or third. My dreams sometimes draw on experiences I've had in real life earlier that day or week. If I'm too warm or too cold I often wake up a little, then doze back off and go immediately back into the dream. My dreams don't normally end until I've reached some sort of resolution to the dream's conflict. I almost always wake up freaked out after a very intense dream or scary nightmare, unable to distinguish between the real world and the dream world for several minutes. 

I absolutely fucking hate that I have to deal with this all the time, and I'd really like to find a way to stop myself from dreaming so much. I've realized that I don't dream (or at least don't remember them as much) when I go to sleep after extremely heavy drinking or after I've smoked a ton of trees, but that's not exactly a nightly habit I want to--or can afford to--form. I don't eat right before bed and I try to get off the internet for a while before going to bed, but neither of those strategies helped. Does anyone have advice on how I can cut back on the dreams in a healthy way? Herbal remedies, meditation, anything? I'd really appreciate it.

Health,"19 years old, suffered back pain, shaking hands, muscle spasms and headaches since 12. Any ideas..?","Hi there, I'm hoping some of you might be able to help me out here.  Since I was about 12 years of age, I started to have back problems.  When the back problems came my hands got shakes that are constantly on going.  Most people comment on how bad they are.  My back also has regular ""muscle spasms"" (doctors words.) which just put me into crippling agony.  Lately now too headaches have become regular, not just average headaches either but crippling headaches I can do nothing about it.  The headaches tend to accompany the back pain.  I've had x-ray's, cat scans, even physical therapy.  I've been on pain killers (Tramadol based.) for a long time now, but in careful amounts (to avoid addiction.) 37.5 MG but I was also on 50MG ones and codeine based tablets at one stage, as well as diazepam (valium, for the spasms.)  Lately though - I've noticed that even the pain killers are not ridding the pain.  If they pain gets exceptionally bad I will some times turn to pot if no pain killers are available.

Doctors, to this day, are stumped.  They acknowledge my pain is legitimate and that something is causing it.  No one knows what, why or how.  I personally suspect it was my school bag for years having to carry many heavy books all day on your back.  But again, I'm speculating...

If anyone has any idea - or anything I could say to my GP to consider an alternate route of examination - would be amazingly appreciated.

19 years of age, female, height and weight unknown (I will be going to my GP next week - I can get the accurate update then.) I do however remember my last BMI to be 21.

Thank you for reading.

EDIT:  I forgot to mention, I ave seen multiple specialists for my back already, although I'm not sure what they name on them would be, to the ones suggesting something to do with the brain, that has never been looked at or even thought about.  I also left out they are leaning towards the ""pinched nerves"" theory.  Sorry about that, pain messes with your focus.

Edit 2: I'm scheduled for an out of hours visit tonight due the severity of the pain today, I'll let you guys know how it goes and I'll say some of this to him, thank you all for your great great help!  I really appreciate all you guys are doing for me, thank you so much for all your good wishes, information and input, it's really appreciated.

Edit 3: I'm just home from the after hours visit, they took bloods, I have an appointment next week again with my GP, they gave me valium and Tramadol.  So I'm a bit dazed right now to be perfectley honest, very little pain though.  The valium really helped take the sting out.

I really want to say thank you so much to everyone, you guys are amazing and so selfless, I really appreciate all your best wishes and it made me get a nice smile on such a painful day!

We have a fast stream area, trauma/resuscitation bays, a 24hr stay area and general cubicles. Currently we follow the standard triage protocols, pts are redirected to an appropriate area, treated, then discharged or await admission.

Our ER is undergoing a drastic change in an attempt to combat ever-increasing numbers of daily presentations. The new model: 

* Replaces the triage nurse with a single nurse who sees the patient for a few minutes and redirects them to the appropriate area - trauma/resus, fast stream or assessment cubicle. 

* Each pt is seen within 10 minutes by a nurse and Attending-led team - either an intern, resident, fellow; all pts run by the Attending (Trauma/Resus care does not change, seen immediately). 

* All interventions and assessments are ordered within 30 minutes, and the patient is transferred to a general cubicle or short stay unit and a new team of doctors/RNs. 

* Once it has been determined whether the patient needs admission or discharge, they are either discharged within 4 hrs (where practical) or accepted by the most relevant specialty. Interim orders are written by ER staff. Assuming there are beds, they are sent directly to the appropriate ward prior to seeing the specialty team. They are admitted on the ward.

This radical change has been met with both excitement and skepticism on the part of RNs and physicians. Has anyone worked in this kind of environment before? Any thoughts on this?",6,19,2012-09-24,PHARMA,0.052238427102565765,0.9176807403564453,0.030080784112215042

This is the first time I've done anything like this, so I'm not 100% sure on how to give you guys proof of donation, right now I'm just planning on donating everything that I get from this directly to MSF through their website. I'm up for suggestions on how to give you guys proof of donation if you want it. 

Some details about the app:
It lets you calculate medical statistics using the following tests: 
CHA2DS2-VASc Score Calculator, QTc Interval Calculator, Framingham Coronary Score Calculator, HAS-BLED Score Calculator, LDL Cholesterol Calculator, MAP Calculator, TIMI Risk Index.  

Here's the link to the app:

medicine,Has anyone here done a combined MD/PhD program or know much about it? I'm an undergrad trying to figure out what to do with my life and in need of some advice.,"Hey r/medicine. So right now I'm majoring in Genetics at a pretty good university and I'm trying to figure out if I want to be premed, go to grad school, become a hobo, whatever. I was told about a combined MD/PhD program by one of my professor's and have been doing some research on it. It looks like a really cool opportunity and definitely something I'm interesting in, academic medicine and doing research in a clinical field. However, I don't know of anyone who has actually done this and wanted to get some info from people who have. 

So does anyone here have a MD and a PhD that they acquired at the same time through a mstp program? What was it like? What did you have to do during your undergraduate years to get there? Is the living stipend enough for you to live(I ask because I'm pretty poor and doing work study, so I can't afford med school without loans)? What are you doing now with your degrees?

medicine,How much importance is placed on *where* I attend medical school?,"Hi, college freshman here. I have a strong passion for medicine (my dad is  a doctor and I only had to hear a few of his stories to fall in love with it) but in high school I fell under the spell of school reputations. I became obsessed with getting into the top, Ivy-League schools, thinking that they could teach me what other schools could not (In a general education sense, I understand that research is a different story). Senior year of high school I realized that learning and education is so much more of what I put into it than it is where I go. That being said, I am not sure whether or not the same realization can be made about Medical School. I do recognize that there certainly is some weight placed in a school's name and reputation, but it is my belief that, pardon my metaphor, a school's reputation gets your foot in the door, but your experience and hard work keeps you in the building. So I'm not sure how I should let a medical school's reputation affect my decision, or if it should affect my decision at all.

TL;DR: From an *educational and learning standpoint*, would I end up regretting *not* going to a 'famous' medical school e.g. HarvardMed, StanfordMed, etc. ?

Edit: Thanks everyone for your thoughtful answers! This is a great community. On the topic of Biochemistry, I took a year of science that did one semester of Ochem and one semester of Biochem. So that did introduce me to it, but the college I'm at right now only offers one Biochem class (I'm currently at a community college) and I don't think it's even the difficulty I need, so I'm going to wait until junior year when I transfer to take my biochemistry. Until then, I'll be exhausting my school's biology, chemistry, physics, and math courses. Again, thanks everyone for the feedback.",53,18,2012-09-29,PHARMA,0.024682993069291115,0.9310430884361267,0.04427391663193703

* IBS
* Mild to severe weight gain or loss
* Alcohol intolerance (I'm strictly a social drinker but it's a rather key part of my social life)
* Intolerance of certain foods, such as fatty foods (can live without) or spicey foods (can't live without)

We are a group of students at UC Berkeley conducting some research on the principles of open innovation. Johnson &amp; Johnson Company has asked us to run a month-long Innovation Challenge, with the intent of answering the following question: **What new sources of revenue can J&amp;J create for its pharmaceutical or medical devices businesses in today's FDA regulatory environment?**


We believe that innovative solutions come from people with diverse experiences and perspectives, so we thought we would reach out to Reddit to see what kinds of ideas we could generate. Also, there are rewards for participating! If J&amp;J values your idea, you will receive a certificate of merit issued by top J&amp;J executives and the Dean of UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business! And if your idea wins, you may be eligible to pitch your idea directly to J&amp;J executives over dinner!


Interested in being a part of the challenge? Register and participate at:

https://nsf.brightidea.com/CChallengeJandJ


The challenge will last from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1, so register now and participate early and often! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us. Thanks!
