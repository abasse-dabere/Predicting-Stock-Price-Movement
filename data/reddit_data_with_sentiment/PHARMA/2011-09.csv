medicine,Seeking help for depression as a soon-to-be medical student; stigma and/or repercussions?,"(I plan to talk to a doctor regardless of the answers to this question, so please don't hesitate to be honest. Just want to know what I'm in for.)
 
This might sound strange/misinformed (if so, I'm glad), but are there any potential repercussions for medical students seeking help from a psychologist/psychiatrist for depression? How about once I (hopefully) become a physician? I would hate to get in a situation where a record of mental health issues would somehow hurt my career.
 
For some background, my symptoms seem like fairly ""normal"" depression - although bad at times - and they probably stem from a difficult childhood (bad alcoholism in the family). I've been dealing with this for 10+ years on my own, and tired of doing so.
 
Googling this for a while yielded less than helpful results, so I hope you guys have some input. Thanks!
 
**Edit:** Despite the positive comments so far (thanks btw), I am still a little concerned. More googling produced [this JAMA article](http://www.afsp.org/files/misc_/JAMA.physician_suicide2003.pdf) from 2003 which discusses a number of reasons why physicians avoid seeking counseling, including: 
 
-""One study found that residency prospects were reduced for otherwise qualified students with a history of psychological counseling...""
 
-""physicians with psychiatric disorders often encounter overt or covert discrimination in medical licensing, hospital privileges, health insurance, and/or malpractice insurance...""
 
-""state licensing boards, which required submission of psychiatric records""... (though this one might no longer be a problem as they discuss policy changes
 
etc. ^ what I was afraid of
 
Any thoughts or ideas on how to minimize likelihood of future problems?
 
**Edit 2:** Thanks everyone for the advice. Consensus seems to be: seek counseling, but it can't hurt to do so from someone in private practice/not connected to the school. This simultaneously confirms and alleviates my concerns. I plan to take the advice, and just want to thank you all again for the input.",24,4,2011-09-04,PHARMA,0.14934185147285461,0.824623167514801,0.026034921407699585

After I realised I had thrush, and struggled with the oral thrush for a little bit, my skin started to flare up. All of it. I've always suffered with dry-ish skin during winter and it's insanely worse right now(australia). I fear I'd have significant rashes if it weren't for clotrimazole skin creams.

**But the whole point of this post is:** I've also suffered from the symptoms described in Candida Overgrowth sections in [alternative/pop medicine websites\(ugh\)](http://health.ninemsn.com.au/family/familyhealth/688983/what-is-candidiasis). Mental fog, generalised anxiety, frustration, fatigue, skin rashes, thrush and irritability. My doctor seems to refuse to acknowledge it as an issue, seems to want to treat my skin. I've been self treating for candida overgrowth haphazardly for about a month and it's really the only time in my life I've seen genuine improvement for all the symptoms I've listed, even if I'm not 100% on the ball with it all the time.

There seems to be a vocal contingent of people who either hate medicine, or med school, or regret their decision to get into medicine, etc.

Is it just that people are more likely to be motivated to write on negative aspects of things in general? Or is this really *a terrible life to get into*?

I'd really like to hear the flip side. I'd really like to hear the reasons people don't regret getting into medicine. I'd really like to hear about what people *love* about being in medicine.

medicine,"Doctors and studants from r/medicine, I have a case quiz for you!","Hey r/medicine! Just got back from the hospital, and I had quite a interesting case today. I thought I could share this with all of you, ladies and gentleman.

It's a very interesting case because of it's rich semiology. It is a not so unusual disease under quite unusual circunstances. It may not chalenge more experienced doctors so much, but I'm sure students will have a hard time figuring the diagnosis out because of the vastness of information.

I know I was impressed. This case is not in my usual scope.

I won't give our conduct or the diagnosis until before I go to sleep, in 6~8h. Have a good puzzle solving time! Here are my notes:

--------------------

55 year old man, caucasian, married for twenty years, retired due to his condition.

Reason for the consult: ""I've been having some joint pain for a while""

Recent history: Presents with severe joint pain in several joint, but specialy at his fingers, made worst by moving the limbs/fingers and lifting weight. There is also swelling of every joint affected, that never gets better. all symptons are worst at night, and he often wakes up in pain, because the weight of his sheets are hurting him.

Has been using oral diclofenac for pain relief, with mild succes, against medical advice.

Diagnostic hypothesis: gout.

Past history:

Patient had a total of 9 kidney stones. None of them would show on the x-ray, only on the US. He removed 3, the first couple when he was 16 (not a mistake) and a Staghorn. The stones he has now are all minor, compared to the old ones. He denies back pain, but says one of his kidneys no longer works.

He's been hypertense for as long as he can remember, but says it was diagnosed after the first couple stones were removed (SIC). Is currently on irregular use of captopril and anlodipine.

Likewise, he has anemia for as long as he can remember. (SIC)

Has had ostheosporosis for 30 years, right after his marriage, that has worsend to the point it's hard to walk.

The chronic kidney failure has been diagnosed about 20 years ago, after the removal of the staghorn calculus. He brings an US that shows a very diminshed right kidney. The left kidney shows no significant alterations. None of his 6 stones are seen in the x-ray.

Also had a ischemic stroke 5 years ago, that left him with some dificulty to speak and move his left arm.

Ever since the stroke he has been experiencing arrithmias and chest pain. He claims his last physician told him his hearth was enlarged (SIC), but he brings no exams to confirm that.

Denies diabetes (one is out!).

Family history: nothing relevant that he can remember. His father died of a stroke (SIC).

Social history: Evangelical. Denies smoking and drinking, ever. Denies recreational drugs, ever. Denies sexual promiscuity.
Presents no relevant risk factors for any disease that might matter to this case.
Claims he eats little and healthy.

On physical examination:

General state:
Male, 176cm, 79kg, 69 cm on abdomen.
Lucid, oriented, talks with dificulty, Glasgow 15/15.
No cyanosis or jaundice. Edema on lower limbs.
Pale mucous membranes 3/4+.

Vitals:
BP: 190x140
pulse: 89 bpm
Temp: 37,0 celsius on axilla
Breathings: 22 bpm

Movement:
Got in the room marching with short steps.
Dificulty moving his left arm in any direction.
Had trouble sitting dow and standing.

Cardiovascular:
Regular Cardiac Rythim, 2 Sounds, NormoPhonetic Hearth Sounds, no murmurs. Metalic click on mithral focus. Ictus devieted to the Left.

Pulmonary:
Present Pulmonary Sounds, Expansive, Normotimpanic lungs.

Urinary:
Nothing to report. Giordano sign was not tested.

Complementary examinations (only the altered results):

Slightly elevated neutrophiles.
Slightly elevated plaquets.
Slightly decreased albulmin.

Uric acid extremely elevated.

Every part of his lipidic profile was slightly elevated.

Creatinin 1,7 (high), urea 48 (normal), creatinin filtering rate 23 (very low).

He also bought exams to support each claim he made about his past conditions, so that we could confirm what he had in the past.

-----------------------------

We started treatment for his new found gout, but where wondering how could someone have so many symptons and diseases at once.

A guy at our team noticed there was a couple exams we should still make. Biochemic and imaging. We did then, and found an underlying cause for all this.

I will come back later to give you people the name of the exams and the name of the disease! I could also add a smalll discusion about how my friend figured out this diagnosis, if you guys want it. Smell ya later, r/medicine! Fell free to speculate on the comments!

**EDIT: Time has come...**

Let's think about it backwards, in a very, VERY, simplified way.

He had acid uric kidney stones since he was 16. Those destroyed his kidneys, as time went by. After he got Chronic Kidney Failure, he became severely hypertense. His vitamin D production was also affected, because Vit. D is activated in the kidneys. So his bones started decaying. They decayed so much he had trouble walking. He also had anemia, most of the time. This probably got worse with the kidney dying, and must have had a role in his stroke and hearth failure. Now his acid uric levels are scaling even more - you can tell because the crystals are no longer being deposited in his kidneys, but are going thru his blood and forming in his joints. To make things worse, he started taking an NSAID that is terrible for the kidneys and is a powerful antiuricosuric.

So, most of his problems are a consequence of the kidney failure, and the kidney failure was developed because of kidney stones... But his bone decay was very imoressive for a 55 year old male, so I had an idea: calcium was leaving his bones, too.

Turns out no one ever tested his blood for parathormone. It's standard in kidney failure, because it can produce secondary hiperparathyroidsm. I asked for the exam. He had high parathormone, but never had high calcium levels. I was satisfied. A friend of mine, an endocrinologist, was not.

He told me that my diagnose still had a flaw: his phosphate levels were low. At secondary HPT, they are usually high. We asked for an neck CT and biopsy of the gland... He had primary HPT!

**Our patient, 55 years old, had symptons for Primary Hyperparathyroidism since he was 16. His first signs were kidney failure and kidney stones - the most obvious ones, but nobody ever thought of it. If he had surgery to remove his parathyroids 40 years ago, he would be mostly healthy today!**

Health,Treating Plantar Warts with Duck Tape and Power Sander?,"Duck tape is a definite treatment that my doctor said works. When you change the duck tape, you're supposed to file/pare down the wart site. My doctor recommended using a pumice stone. I have found this to be ineffective. Today at the hardware store, I bought an orbital power sander. It is much more effective at filing down the dead skin.

Unfortunately, despite how obvious it might seem to use a sander to sand down dead skin on your foot, I can't find any information about approaches to doing it or whether it's effective. I have found resources that mention sandpaper as opposed to pumice, but not anything related to using a power sander.

Health,A Bittersweet Reddit Cake Day. Today I go to war with cancer.,"Today my father will probably die of stomach cancer (Gastric Carcinoma Linitus Plastica). He ask for me and when I arrived, he told me so. And given his current state of health, I believe him.

A few months ago my mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Luckily it was very minor and she caught it early and was able to take it out. Unfortuantly a couple weeks ago, we found out she has Lung Cancer (Carcinoid Cancer of the lung). She is awaiting more test results to know more.

I am pretty pissed about this, understandably so. And like I said in the title, I would like to go to war with cancer. The only way I know of to do this is to raise awareness and help raise money for cancer research (however, if you know of other ways, I am all ears). But I want to do something fun that other redditors may enjoy.

I did some looking and there is a Relay for Life next week in Burlingame California, which appears to be in the bay area.
http://relay.acsevents.org/site/TR/RelayForLife/RFLFY11CA?fr_id=34902&amp;pg=entry
I was thinking of starting up a reddit group and any redditors out there that want to go can go. Think of it as a reddit meetup for a cause. But really this all depends on the interest of all of you.

I failed 2 classes my first year (phys and neuro), so I had to remediate the whole first year. I did do pretty well the second time around though.

My second year, I accidentally submitted my pathology final after finishing only 2/6 question blocks netting me a whopping 24% and bringing my 88 avg to a 67, thus failing another class.  I remediated that this summer.

Now, I'm about to take my step1, and after a few of the NBME practice tests it looks like I'll probably be in the underwhelming 205-215 range.

I'm not trying to get into anything competitive, but I was sort of hoping to match in a particular state so that I didn't have to live away from my wife for 4 years.  Is this going to make it ridiculously difficult for me to match?

Firstly it began in my left wrist - a dull ache which came and went. I thought little of it and continued to work. A few days later, the pain intensified and so I sought my doctor's advice.

He prescribed me an anti-inflammatory (Celebrex) and told me I could continue working on the condition that I take more frequent breaks, and avoid gaming after hours to rest. 

It is now almost a week later, and while there has been a little improvement (at the cost of utter boredom due to not having many other hobbies for after hours), I still am experiencing spontaneous pain more often than I really should be. Also, my other wrist has begun flaring up.

So I have a couple of questions for you knowledgable people, since this is worrying me. 

1. Is it normal to be taking a long time to recover? I've done a lot of googling on the subject, and while most things I've read have agreed upon resting, they don't seem to mention anything about time frames.
2. I have been doing some wrist stretches in an attempt to assist the healing process, though I cannot gauge if its helping. Would it be? Can anyone recommend good stretches/exercises to perform to aid recovery?
3. The least important thing, but boredom is killing me and therefore I must ask. The RSI has been brought on by keyboard use, would I be able to continue gaming without worsening the situation I'm in by using a console? In theory I would be making different hand movements than keyboard and mouse. I feel stupid for asking, but the dumbest question is the one left unasked...

I am seeing my doctor again tomorrow morning, however it is my opinion that the more information I can get, the better. If anyone can help me out, I would be extremely grateful.

Thanks in advance!

Edit:
UPDATE

I saw my doc again, and he sent me for xrays to ensure there wasn't anything related to my bones. That came back clear, and I was then referred to a physio. Hopefully they'll sort me out, I have my first appointment on Friday. 
I'm also going to speak to my boss and see if I can convince the company to get me an ergonomic keyboard - shouldn't be too difficult since I'm 1/3rd of the tech team :-P

Health,Antisocial personality disorder: Do you have it? Does someone you know have it?  How does it affect you? It has a huge influence on my life,"I saw the thread that was along the lines of ""how badly did your friends fuck you over"" and as I was reading comments someone was a friend with a person who has Antisocial personality disorder. And then I look it up to find out more about what it is really to find out that it describes everything I have been or done since I was 16. Anyways, A little back story - I honestly thought I had depression since I was 16 and it was rough to actually talk to myself like that, fast forward 4 years I realized It was deeper then that and I couldn't understand what was holding me back. - I really don't know how to explain what it is that I have but I will try my best, basically I was born with this power within me to trump everything I encounter problematic with logic and I have always known it was there it just feels like I live on another level with regards to the average Joe. I have a higher understand of the world around me and how it operates then the average person so I believe that my logic literally saved me from my antisocial personality disorder to becoming a *disorder*

&gt;Treatment: **Antisocial personality disorder is one of the most difficult personality disorders to treat People with this condition rarely seek treatment on their own**. They may only start therapy when required to by a court. The effectiveness of treatment for antisocial personality disorder is not known. Treatments that show the person the negative consequences of illegal behavior seem to hold the most promise.

With my knowledge and experience first hand with Antisocial Personality Disorder I firmly understand what it really means to the people who have it. I really wanted to see if other people out there knew as much as I did about this because honestly this disorder is crippling. Its uncontrollable at best you'll grasp your shit after you fucked up.

I've only just begun to take pre-med courses so I'm not in too deep yet. My biggest fear is being unsatisfied with my career AFTER I've gone through med school.

Becoming a doctor also sounds a lot less appealing if it means I'm going to have to be a workhorse for the next however many year. If I plan on having a family in the future with whom I'd spend a decent amount of time with, am I barking up the wrong tree with trying to become a doctor? I'm really in a bind here because I had everything planned out and have no other obvious career paths I'm interested in. But now I'm having mixed feelings about the medical field and so I come here.

What do you all think? How true are the things that the blog post claims?

Health,"I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis, I'm looking for stories/advice from other people who share the condition.","Ive always had sensitive skin, since I was a baby. I first started showing symptoms when I was 15 (I am now 26), it started with an itchy scalp and mild dandruff. When Head &amp; Shoulders quit working I moved on to T-Gel, then Selsun Blue, then H&amp;S intensive care, then a prescription shampoo (active ingredient Selenium Sulfide). Each shampoo worked wonders...at first (it seriously felt like sticking your head in the freezer on a hot summer day), however they all stopped working after about a month. Then began using combinations of each shampoo, until that stopped working. When I found myself washing my hair with 5 different shampoos each night to simply *maintain* a tolerable level of itchy dandruff, I quit and went cold turkey. After 2 months my conditions returned to their original levels, but still persist to this day. From a scale of 1-10, with 1 being ""my head itches"" and 10 being ""my hair is falling out"" i'm usually in the 4-7 range. My father had the same condition, to some degree, when he was my age but now is clear of symptoms (at 65).

Anyone else with SD that can share stories, advice? Im not looking for a cure, there is none. Im just interested in listening to other people's experience. Thanks!

P.S. I would like to add that this condition is NOT all that bad, compared to say, cancer. If there was a /firstworldproblems for chronic health conditions this would fit. Just inconvenient, occasionally embarrassing, and kind of aggravating (think entire head sized mosquito bite itchiness).

Health,"Trying out the crazy ""No Shampoo"" thing.  Wish me some greasy luck.","For as long as I can remember I've had two major health issues: cystic acne and dandruff.  Now that I'm in my early 30's, I've learned to live with both, but I still keep my eyes and ears open for new possible solutions.

I've tried a long list of various shampoos, conditioners and other wacky home remedies, nothing has helped, some have made it worse (I'm not a fan at all of Head and Shoulders).

A while back I heard of a (some might say disgusting or bizarre) method of washing your hair that does not involve shampoo.  Some have said that it made their hair more full and feel better, while others have even said it cleared up their scalp issues.  

Instead of shampoo you mix a teaspoon of baking soda with a cup of water and wash your hair with it.  Then rinse with a mixture of a teaspoon of vinegar and a cup of water.  

I figured, what can it hurt?  I've got thin, greasy hair with itchy dandruff, so if I give this a shot and it clears up my issues then I'll not only save money by not buying shampoo, but I'll be finally rid of one of my long-standing issues.  And if it doesn't work?  Well then I'll have a greasy head for a week or however long I can go before I cave in and use shampoo.

Most reports say that your hair will seem to get worse before it gets better since your hair has to adjust to not having the oils stripped away every shower.  The period of adjustment is from 1 to 6 weeks.

One thing I have going for me in this experiment is that my hair is cut extremely short, so it shouldn't look too horribly disgusting even if it does get a tad oily.

Edit:  Forgot to mention, I'm a dude.

**Day 1:** Used the baking soda and water mixture and just rinsed with water.  Got out of the shower and my hair felt different, but not necessarily bad.  After it dried it actually seemed better than normal. The hair seems fuller.  This may be due to a bit extra oil that the shampoo would normally wash away.

I do have a very slight ""I need to take a shower"" feeling right now, but it's not nearly as bad as if I hadn't taken a shower, or just rinsed my hair with water.  This also could be a mental thing because I know I didn't use shampoo.

**Evening 1:** By the end of the day I was feeling a bit dirty, had the urge to shower.  But I held off.  It took me a long time to fall asleep because it felt like I my hair was soaking my pillow, but I have a feeling it was more psychological than physical.  I think switching to a shower at night instead of the morning might help, but I need to wash away that grimey feeling I have every morning.

**Day 2:** Used the baking soda and water mixture again.  After I rinsed with water my hair felt very strange.  It was matted down and almost crispy.  I then poured a mixture of apple cider vinegar and water over my head and massaged it in, left it on while I went through the rest of my showering routine and then rinsed it out.  That got rid of the crispy feeling and returned it to the somewhat-oily feeling I had after the first day's shower.

The dandruff already seems to be lessened but that could just be me getting my hopes up.  :)

This was the worst, because it gave me what looked like thrush, and it was terrible to talk and eat. This happened rarely. This continued all the way until college, where it has only gotten worse. I always get them on my tongue, as well as everywhere all over my mouth. At the moment, I have two on my tongue, and 2 others in my gums. They last about a week before they go away, but then another one pops up. It used to be I would have a few weeks before I got another one, but now I always have at least one canker sore in my mouth. I've had enough.

I've tried switching to SLS-free toothpaste like the internet has suggested, but it doesn't help.
