pharmacy,"Questions for Canadians, Australians, and UK pharmacists","How much did it cost to become a pharmacist in your country?

I'm asking these questions as a new pharmacy school student (just completed my first semester in pharmacy school).

pharmacy,Got pulled aside and reprimanded by a superior pharmacist today at work for this... what do you guys think?,"So here's the story: I'm a technician at a large retail chain pharmacy. I was helping a very long line of customers when a nice looking woman steps up next in my pick up line. I ask her name and retrieve her rx's, I return and notice that one script was billed to cash for over $100.00. There was a note on the bag that read, ""insurance too soon until 1/8/2014."" I asked the customer if she was aware of the price, and that it was too soon. She said she knew and asked if I could put it on a discount card. At that point, even though I knew that the pharmacist would say no (my thought here is that the discount card would have been applied if she wanted it to be discounted), I wanted to be sure. I walked back to the final ver. pharmacist and politely asked if she would, she said no, and continued to tell me she would not break the pack either (sumatriptan, #9 blister). We commonly break these packs for people all the time. I didn't understand why she was persistent on not helping this woman. Whatever... I walked back to the counter. I told the customer that I could not apply a discount card, and that the cards are only for people who have no insurance/not on formulary. The customer says we have done it before (and we have, for all kinds of people, not on controls or anything, but we have. I'm not certain if we had for this woman, but it's true that we have done so for others). Anyways, the customer is not satisfied, keeps questioning my ability to apply the discount, requests for only a few blisters, and explains how her husband lost her job and that's why she gets migraines, and it eventually comes down to me apologizing and explaining that I am only doing what I am told and there is nothing more I can do for her. She asked to transfer out, I tell her to have her new pharmacy call us and we would be happy to. I apologize again, ring her out for her other scripts that were covered on the insurance, and send her on her way. I was called to the back of the pharmacy by the RPh and was accused of 'throwing the pharmacist under the bus' and heard an earful in the middle of my shift for that one comment (I'm doing what I am told). I can't help wondering if anyone would agree? The whole situation was made out to seem like the customer was drug seeking or something... I don't get it. I know RPh's who discount controls! Was it really that big of a deal? Was my comment really making the pharmacy or any of its employees look bad?

TLDR; Gave the 'I'm doing what I am told' comment to a very disgruntled customer, after a long explanation, and apparently made the whole pharmacy look bad by 'throwing the pharmacist under the bus' for a decision she made herself to not discount a noncontrolled medication.",51.0,9,2014-01-02,PHARMA,0.08087513595819473,0.8937670588493347,0.02535777911543846

Health,Problems with my jaw?,"**Not sure if this is related to my main problem:**

About 4 months ago, I yawned really hard and I heard a popping noise near my right jaw. Then for the longest time, my upper and lower teeth closest to the joint would hurt when I kept my mouth closed, chewed, etc. I went to a doctor and (**If I remember right**) he said I yawned so hard, I tore a tendon in my mouth. He gave me a shot and the pain was gone.


**My main problem**

About 2 month later, I noticed my jaw started locking up. It wasn't major at first, I could still open my mouth a good amount, but if I tried to open it all the way, I'd have to force it and then I'd hear a popping noise. Eventually, my mouth started locking up more I could open my mouth less/ had to put more pressure towards opening my mouth.

Now my jaw feels kinda normal, but I'm planning on going to see a doctor sometime this week. Is what I have really serious?

I recently got accepted into Pharmacy school. I haven't mailed my response in yet. I have until January 15 to mail the school my $1,000 deposit, background check, technical agreement, etc. 

I am currently working as a Pharmacy technician at a large chain. I am growing more and more discouraged about staying in retail as an RPh and having that type of job for a long time.

Health,I'm having strange stomach pains,"About a month ago (Dec 4) I started experiencing stomach pain which feels a lot like gas. I feel like I need to poop but when I go to the bathroom, I don't push out much if anything at all.  Once a day I'll have a full poop, and it is usually very soft or fully liquid.

I was away for 2 weeks on a ship in the Gulf of Mexico for my job, and I was fine for those 2 weeks.

I got home Dec 21, and felt fine for another week. Then the same symptoms returned, this time the pain was excruciating, but I figured it was a stomach bug so I let it go and I felt OK a couple days later.

It has now returned for a third time. I went to an urgent care doctor a few days ago who didn't really know what to say, but she gave me antibiotics in case it's a bacterial thing. Not feeling any better after 4 days.

I don't have excess gas, no extra burping or farting (in fact less than usual). It just feels bloated and the weird poop feeling and loose stool. I've had no nausea whatsoever. Pepto doesn't seem to help much, neither do antacids or immodium.  If it keeps up this week I'm going to make an appointment to see a gastroenterologist.

I should point out that before the first experience of these symptoms, I used Kratom, which is a tea made from the leaves of a tree in Thailand that has a relaxing, numbing effect.  I also took it before the second round of symptoms, which made me think it could be the culprit, but I haven't taken it since and there were a few days in between when I felt 100% fine. I've taken it a few times over the summer and had none of these symptoms, so I'm not sure what to think.  Not taking it any time soon, that's for sure.

Apparently there is supposed to be three seperate injections (thiopental, pancuronium bromide and calium chloride are listed as examples), but more and more often they end up only using one because pharmaceutical companies refuse to sell the medications because they are used for executions.

Health,How I haven't contracted flu or a cold this season,"Excuse the long post.


Here are a few things I've done to remain cold and flu free this winter, and *so far* it seems to be working!


I am a long time suffer of cold and flu, every time a person near me was ill, I'd also contract it. Even if I was just in a room with a person who was mildly ill, I'd contract something or at least feel shitty for a few days.


When I'd fully contracted cold or flu I'd be ill for weeks at a time, contracting one bug, getting well for a few weeks/days, then contracting another, repeating till the summer came.


This year I thought I'd try something different.

1. I stopped biting my nails.
2. I stopped picking my nose (sorry that's gross but true).
3. I wash my hands when ever I return home and before I eat.
4. I don't touch my face if possible.
5. I don't touch door handles.


While this may appear like I'm some sort of weird Howard Hughes character, it's very easy to use a sleeve or elbow to touch something, rather than your fingers.


Now this may be all psychosomatic but so far, it's working. Every previous year I'd have been ill 3 or 4 times by now and almost every Christmas I can remember I've been ill. Not this year though.

pharmacy,Questions regarding Pharm.D.,"I recently graduated this past December with a BS in biochemistry. The plan was to pursue a PharmD but after much deliberation and many discussions with those who've dealt with such dilemmas, I decided to abandon the PharmD in pursuance of a MS/PhD in neuroengineering.

This choice stems from my passion to work with a team that designs medical devices that interact with the brain (e.g. deep brain stimulation implant for Parkinson's disease). Ideally I'd want to pursue my interests without such a drastic change in degree. So my question is, do pharmacists in the industry have relevance in this line of work or any that are related to designing implants?

medicine,Gluten sensitivity in the general population (Questions about a 2007 Gut paper),"Hi Meddit,
My brother is an adamant gluten-free advocate, insisting that a GF diet is ideal for not only individuals with celiac disease, but also for the general population. To support his claim, he points to p. 136 of the 2013 book The Paleo Manifesto by John Durant. I quote, ""Even though gluten is associated with a small percentage (about 0.4% to 0.8% in the United States), it causes gut inflammation in over 80% of people.""

In Durant's notes, he cites a 2007 paper in Gut by Bernardo et al. titled ""Is gliadin really safe for non‐coeliac individuals? Production of interleukin 15 in biopsy culture from non‐coeliac individuals challenged with gliadin peptides."" Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1954879/

I can't understand this paper, and my anti-gluten brother understands it even less. Can anyone provide any insight into the validity and/or significance of this paper, which a popular ""paleo"" writer used to justify his bold claim that 80% of the general population has gluten sensitivity?

Thanks for any replies!

EDIT: Still open to finding out more from anyone who knows for sure, but this is what I've found so far (meaning, pieced together from various speculations I've found by consulting Dr. Google..: 

It is related to vascular or capillary leak. Loss of serum proteins causes third spacing of fluids, and the intravascular volume is actually depleted, leading to increase release of ADH. ADH functions by causing retention of sodium. This leads to increased production of ANP, which is a natriuretic - leading to hyponatremia and normotension. 

Like I said, I'm not sure on this and would love to hear back from anyone who knows for sure, but this is what I've been able to piece together so far from various sources...

Health,"Neck, shoulder, &amp; upper back pain/discomfort","I've done countless hours, even days of finding info very similar to my issues and have yet to find a true answer or solution. Therefore, please bear with me and my hope is that this post will also help others with the same issues.

First of all - I'm 6'5"" played sports as a kid, I'm 180 lbs and generally not very active anymore. I used to be very active. I play a lot of video games at the computer and I also work at a desk. So most of my life at this point is sitting down. I'm very aware that this is likely the main source of the problem, however I've done the following to correct posture:

- Yoga exercises
- Awareness of my posture
- Breaks to stretch
- Worked out my Trap/Rhomboids consistently for months while stretching pectorals. At one point this seemed like it was working good, then it reverted.
- Bought a new memory foam mattress
- Ergonomics at all desks are specified near-perfect according to my research

However I'm sort of starting backwards here. Fixing my posture was actually the last thing I've tried to date, and it has seemed to be the best, ironically. But my quality of life is just so low with this constant restraint/stress in my upper back and shoulders (and neck). 

Let me explain a little more in depth what my issues are. My upper neck, I believe it's C2-C3 area has what feels like my bone/spine sticking out towards the right. It's significant and obvious from the lack of that bone feel on the left side. At one of my jobs I do remember often looking/reaching to the left more than I should have. I wonder if that's related. 

My daily tightness ranges from that upper neck bulge down to my shoulders, particularly the right side is the worst. My trapezius muscles often feel very tight/sore at the base of my neck and I constantly rub them. When I slump my shoulders forward it definitely is more strain, so I work diligently to keep them upright. This pain then moves into my shoulder blades (sort of in between) and then culminates at the shoulders where I feel very tense/restrained. In fact I can pop my shoulders unintentionally almost every time I move them. When I rub my neck and move my shoulders back down they pop loudly almost every time. Also, after I rub my own tight muscles they generally will pop then too. I often feel a need to rotate/rub/pop my shoulders maybe even thousands of times a day. I can't tell you how much I'm moving them. This is where quality of life issues come into play.

Some extra quick facts. Turning my head to the left really far will create a nerve pain that starts in my neck and goes down inside my left shoulder blade. I'm yet to be able to make it stop doing that. I also do constant desk stretches for relief. My ability to focus and concentrate on work some days is completely destroyed, and on the worst days I actually do notice some anxiety. It's got bad enough that I have come to the belief that I maybe even have ADD and have since gone to a mental health specialist and been described Adderall. I still don't believe that to be true, I think it's mostly and largely related to my discomfort.

Funny enough, I don't get headaches though. Just this constant discomfort (I wouldn't necessarily call it pain) all through my upper body. Laying down on the hard floor when I get home from work often feels really good for a while. I will generally do some stretches I learned online too, such as sitting along a wall with arms in your laps, and laying down with your feet up straight against the wall. These actually seem to help for a while, but not any longevity yet.

I want to say that my discomfort sort of started in 2008 when I really started in the accounting field. Hence at the computer more than usual. I've never been in an accident so it must be closely related to sitting down a lot is what I've concluded. It's worth noting that at that time my marriage began, bought a house, and had a child. I've never really mentally/physically ""noticed"" stress or anxiety, so it's hard to say if that's been contributing. But I don't really feel like it has in face value. Hard to say.

About two years ago is when I had had enough and decided to go to my general practitioner. He recommended physical therapy, so I went for 6-8 months. It was often a very aggressive appointment where we used metal bars to sort of ""mash"" up my muscles from my neck and upper back. We also did traction on my neck. Physical therapy was far from a solution, though I'd say it helped a bit. Not worth the time or cost however. 

It was at this point that my PT recommended an Osteopath. Maybe I just got an Osteopath that wasn't too helpful, but I went for two appointments that were about 15 minutes and I felt like he barely even tried to deal with my issues. He recommended me for an injection service, I said no thanks to that. It didn't feel right after an apparent lack of effort.

Then came two appointments at a chiropractor. That really didn't do anything.

So I moved on and tried Magnesium after reading about people who often have deficiencies and how it can help with stress and muscles. I felt like it was a miracle supplement for two weeks. Now it doesn't do anything.

This is about at year 2 and I buckled up and really put in the effort myself because I learned no fix will be magic or easy. My diligent working out and change of beds/shoes/habits/chairs definitely helped from time to time. But there are still too many days and hours and minutes where my shoulder is too distracting. 

My next plan is going to a massage therapist, hopefully consistently. I also would like to schedule an acupuncture visit. My concern is this all just costs so damn much. 

So does anyone have any ideas, be it working out, doctors, tricks, etc? I'm not looking for magic, I'm willing to put in work to make this right. I want to wake up and never feel/think about my upper back, I want to be able to concentrate and fully relax again!

If you've made it this far I can't thank you enough, I hope some answers end up helping others along the way. I apologize as it was likely very ""rambly,"" but I really needed to get all the info out I can so I can share in full and maybe end up finding some people with similar situations.

Health,"Two issues with pain. One in neck, one in ankle. Not sure of what to do.","Neck - On my right side, at the back between the centre and right ear leading to the back of the shoulder, I have had a pain there for roughly 4+ months.  Not sure the cause.  I went to a walk in clinic as it was really rough one day, and he told me to simply put Voltarin on it, and take Advil.  I do have a compressed disc between C4 and C5 (believe), but do not think this has anything to do with the lack of healing.  I am not sure of what to do to fix this as heat, cold, stretching, etc do nothing.

Ankle - While at work (An EA at a school), I was dealing with a young fella.  In protecting myself, I rolled my right ankle inward, and instantly felt a sharp pain, and could put no weight on it. I managed to walk it off, but this was about 2 months ago.  The pain is between the ball of the heel, and that bone that juts out on the right side of the ankle, and it seems to run vertically.  This one too, I am not sure what is a fix.  Ice, heat, etc provide no relief.

For both I plan on calling my doctor tomorrow, but I don't know what to really expect.  I hope to get an MRI done on the ankle given how the pain is and how there really hasn't been any improvement.

medicine,Writing 3 NBMES in 3 weeks...is this normal?,"Quick Backstory: I'm studying in Poland right now, in my 3rd year of a 6 year program and I'm planning to write my Step 1 this summer. I'm 2o right now, having been accepted into this program post secondary graduation. We've already written most of the basic sciences, and I have done relatively well- passed each one and am even on the way to avoiding having to ""pass"" the CBS (although its mandatory at my school anyways).  My school scheduled Patho, Physiology and Pharmacology within 3 weeks of each other; which I find to be ridiculous.  

Those who are writing the Step this summer are desperately trying to move it, however we have many Norwegian students that are against it because they don't really care, their future does not depend on the Step 1 score anyways.  Has anyone else had such bad NBME scheduling? I wonder if our school is the only one that schedules them so close. If we are, I'm contemplating just going to the dean's office and asking for a compromise date, because it doesn't seem fair.

medicine,What field will win/lose with healthcare reform?,"I'm currently a 3rd year medical student and in less then 8 months I have to send out my medical apps. I feel as though we've entered the field in a very precarious time because no one seems to know whats going to happen in different specialties in the future. For better or worse, I've decided what I want to go into and its not that relevant to me if I make 100K or 300K as long as I can pay off my student loans. But I also chose my path because of what I think will happen in the future and I'd love some input from physicians and residents who may have a better understanding.  

I think primary care/internal medicine (specialties included) will be payed at a higher rate but I also think they will be swamped with work. Most are already seeing patients q15 minutes and now there are 40 million more people added. How will they handle this load? I think they going to be incredibly overworked by an unappreciative population group who probably feels like the wait time is too long and they didn't get enough attention. 

ER is probably better that IM because at least you don't have to worry about follow up, but it largely faces the same problems. They are already known for having early burnout, how bad will it be with a larger population group added? Now everyone is insured they are going to come to ER for the most insignificant things because they don't want to wait for IM and it will turn into a cold and flu clinic every season. 

I just want to understand how the health care system which is already suffering a shortage of physicians will handle this change. I get it that more nurses and PA's will be in the picture. I work in one of the largest hospitals on the west coast and while there are certainly a lot of great nurses and PA's there, most nurses see the profession as simply a job not a calling. God forbid someone has to skip a break. Unionization make it very hard to replace them and the quality of care is nowhere near comparable.  

How heavy will the workload be for physicians of the future? Will we have time to live a life outside the hospital. Have a family? Spend time with our children? How badly will our compensation drop, if so will the government do anything about our student loans? Are we just going to drift into a one payer system?

Health,"Just started having reoccurring chest pains. Lately have been tired, some dizziness spells. I don't have health insurance and don't know what to do...I need help.","I feel like I'm going to get so much shit for posting this, but I'm really at a loss of what to do. I think I need serious medical help.

I've been unemployed two and a half months. I have not been able to qualify for unemployment insurance thus far and, therefore to the best of my knowledge, do not qualify for Medicaid either (from what I've gleaned, you have to have some source of income in order to qualify for Medi-cal in California). I'm just living on savings right now and moved back in with my parents, and although I'll hopefully figure out a job sooner rather than later, I'm fearing the health insurance might not come quickly enough...

On and off, over the last few days, I've been feeling some chest pains, which I have not normally felt. I've also experienced spells of dizziness and light-headedness, numbness in toes, etc. I've also been feeling abnormally tired lately--sleeping for 10 hours+ at a time. My dad has a history of heart disease that set on in his 40s, and I know these are all symptoms for a heart attack. Unlike my Dad, I have been overweight on and off for much of my younger years and 20s (I am currently in my mid-20s). I lost a bunch of weight in college, then gained a bunch back while working a very high-stress job after. I lost some of it again when I managed to switch to a new job, then gained some back when I switched to a new high-stress project. Then the project ended very unexpectedly, leaving me without a job or health insurance.

I need to see a doctor. I know I need to see a doctor. I actually haven't seen a doctor in a year and a half, besides the eye doctor and dentist. But there is no way in hell I can afford a doctor, or any medicine of any kind, really, at the present moment. Parents are living mortgage payment to mortgage payment, so they can't pay for a doctor's visit easily. I have been exercising more lately and want to lose the weight again, which I know will help with my long term health...but I'm starting to freak out. I think it might be too late.

I live in the Bay Area of California. Does anyone know of any resources that could help with my situation? Free clinics or cardiologists? I realize it's a long shot, but I've been very worried the last few days and don't know what to do.

medicine,"License ""On-Hold"" and not showing up on State Board site?","Hello r/medical, 

I read the sidebar and believe these questions are permissible here. If you think they should be posed elsewhere, please let me know.

I have questions that I'm hoping you can assist with. Is there *any way* possible, that someone who was issued a medical license and who practiced medicine for over a decade, even recently, could not be found on a given state's medical board license look-up?

Same holds true for their NPI number, can this be suppressed somehow via an NPPES search?

**Edit:** to more easily show [the reason I am asking these questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1vtmam/license_onhold_and_not_showing_up_on_state_board/cevoygm)


**Follow-up:** For those who might have wondered what happened, my sister sent a text this morning. Long and short, he logged on with her to the ECFMG to show her his credentials. Of course, I told her if he is going through ECFMG then he didn't graduate from the medical school he claims to have and the reason I cannot find him in any look-up search is because he isn't currently, and never was, licensed in the US. It also means he isn't the trauma surgeon he said he is, that the whole story of the circumstances surrounding this ""on-hold"" thing is also a total lie (that borders on mental) and that he is, in fact, FOS.  

Result? My sister is now mad at me. 

I told her that while I love her nothing she can say will keep me from contacting the medical board and putting a nail in the coffin as to whether there is any such thing as ""on-hold"" status. At least that will give me one real answer that's truthful. What I think happened? Maybe he couldn't fulfill the USMLE requirements or didn't make it through his residency for some reason and took a PhD instead. Either way, claiming to be a practicing medical doctor and not being one makes this person a louse. 

**TL;DR** If you aren't a medical doctor, don't pretend to be (especially if you will try to be one day.) You never know who you are lying to and the shitty lie you tell in order to get laid, might bite you in the ethics ass one day.

**Edit for Outcome:**  I found out, only last week, that my sister dated this guy for three months. She didn't  speak to me for nearly two months. When I asked why they weren't seeing each other any longer, she said ""he was too over the top and wanted to move too fast"" (No, really?) She was slightly defensive about it while we were talking though I made sure I maintained a judgement-free tone. In the end, this has only left me  concerned about my sister's judgement and I will probably worry about her a lot from here on out particularly since she won't take sound advice and is somehow lacking in red flag radar.

I've been getting pretty nervous hearing that the competition is extremely high this year.

medicine,Do I have what it takes to make it to become a Physician's Assistant?,"**Background**: I am 21 years old. I barely graduated from highschool. I procrastinated, and during the last couple weeks of school I studied as hard as I could knowing it would absolutely kill me watching my classmates walk down the aisle, whilst sitting shamefully amongst their proud friends and family. So I did it. I graduated. Not with a GPA that i'd be proud of, but I did it. (I also acquired a 19 on my ACT)  
      
**Fast forward to now** I am currently enrolled at a state college here in Florida and have a handful of pre-req classes before I can be accepted into the nursing program which i'm hoping will be my undergraduate degree for PA school. My current GPA is a 3.0. Luckily, a stumbling block has been removed from my path in the last 6 months; I have been diagnosed by a neuropsychologist with ADHD. I have therefore been prescribed Amphetamine Salts (generic brand for Adderall). I have seen huge improvement in my focus and it has accentuated my abilities. On a heavier note, 2 years ago I was diagnosed with a polycystic kidney disease where my only kidney (was born with only one) is functioning at a whopping 22%. I will be eligible for a transplant when I am down to 20%. This disease leaves me completely drained, all the time, so I have to make sure to get a sufficient amount of sleep. With that being said, I still have a lot of tendencies that I had in high school, and have not taken any core (science) classes yet. I am hungry to work in the medical field and it's what I was meant to do. I know this because I work in the E.R. currently as ED registration representative, so I know exactly what each position in the E.R. does and what their responsibilities are. It is an actual motivation for me, to end up in the E.R. as a clinical employee.  
      
**My reasoning behind choosing the PA path**

        
**ER Patient Care Tech** - No to little level of responsibility, Long hours little pay, underappreciated, and underrated.  
      
**ER Nurse** - Little to Moderate level of responsibility, over-worked in comparison to their pay scale.  
      
**ER Nurse Practitioner** - Yes, I have researched this as well. 1. By the time I am ready for the program, it will be a doctorate program. 2. I want a mix of bedside manner/patient care (nursing) with some education more focused on the medicine aspect of treatment (PA).  
      
**ER Physicians Assistant** - Only a masters degree is required, Great hours, less legal liability then a MD/DO, responsibility for fast track patients, moderate to high pay, more in depth knowledge into the medicine aspect.      
  
**ER Physician** - Post medical school debt, amount of school (the obvious ones), legally liable for patients, tons of hours, the stress load, malpractice insurance.  
  
I have a bad habit of letting my social life get in the way of school. It is odd, because I have a burning fire to become a physician's assistant, but I still tend to neglect school from time to time. I don't understand how these two things can be occuring at the same time. I know coming soon, school will have to be a full time deal and I want to commit fully to it. It might not help that the group of friends in my area have no intention of going to school at all.  
      
**So what am I looking for?**
      
1. A kick in the butt, tell me like it is.   
2. Success stories, have you struggled like I have and come out on top?   
3. Any opinions in correlation with my situation from medical professionals.    
4. Study tips and/or tricks.    
5. Advice on where I need to make life changes.    
6. Advice on how I can stay commited to school.
      
Any advice or experiences you can give would be HUGELY appreciated. Thank you for reading through this and helping if you have any knowledge pertaining to my situation.

http://imgur.com/a/7XN8O

Here's the story behind them:
I work in a local pharmacy in the province of quebec. I was working the saturday shift when I get a phone call from a very well known patient of ours (88 year old woman) saying that there are two unidentified pills in her dispill blister pack which she doesn't recognize. 

In my head i'm like ""Fuck, we messed up and made a mistake"". So I call our delivery boy to pick up the dispill ASAP. About 30 minutes later I get the dispill given to me and notice two yellow pills (different shapes, different sizes, differents text on them) added to the morning saturday medication, but I have no idea what they are. I look at the different pills from our inventory and none of them seem to match up. 

I noticed the Boehringer-Ingelheim logo on them so I narrow down my research to their products, but none of them match up to ANY of their products. 

So I took a picture, called the Boehringer-Ingelheim rep and sent her the picture to ask her if she could identify them.. I get a call back 1 week later from the head-office and they tell me that these pills aren't Canadian or American. 

At this point I have no idea what to think. Being the stubborn pharmacist that I am, I need to get to the bottom of this. 

This patient is fairly rich so I'm thinking maybe a family member slipped it in the dispill to finish her off and pass it off as an accident.... or maybe I watch too many movies.",5.0,9,2014-01-26,PHARMA,0.0495208278298378,0.9234499931335449,0.02702910639345646

Health,"Ridiculous amount of Food intolerances, trying to figure out a link so I can eat more stuff.","I am 37.

I have a LOT of food intolerance and it's ruining my ability to eat. I will give a case story, but you can jump to the list below if you want...

**My story**

As a kid, I was unable to digest Soy and this didn't pass. When I eat Soy in significant quantities, I get intestinal pain, bloating, gas, constipation, and headaches.

Fine, so I have a food intolerance for soy. If there is soy lecithin added in the last ingredients, I am fine. If there is soy flour, I get ""sick"".

I could digest EVERYTHING ELSE. I am serious... people wondered if I could even get an indigestion. 

Then, I stopped digesting Bananas. Just Bananas, but they tasted different then my childhood. Bah, I'll eat something else...

It continued like that until I was 25 approximately and I started to have the same symptoms when I didn't eat Soy, but a LOT more serious. 

At first, I could find the pattern, so it increased in strength until I realized it was milk products. And discovered it was just about any quantity of Milk products.  A claritin pill with lactose in it would send me to the hospital to have my intestine pumped 12 hours or so after taking it. This was tough because I used to eat a LOT of cheese, etc... 

Before you ask, lactose free products cause the same reaction: it's not to the lactose per se that I react.

My doctor decided to call is an Allergy-like several food intolerance, because the reaction is way too strong for a simple intolerance. He thinks it might be a local allergic reaction in the gut, which is rare but occurs.

I began 1 month later to burp, a lot... 4 to 5 times per hours. I learned from a gastro-enterologist that my stomach, even after 17 hours of feasting, was 98% full of gastic acid. He theorized that I simply produce too much acid and that milk products would calm that so I ate a lot.

Now that I can't, my acid is back full blown. We tried a few things and Nexxium helped a LOT. But after 2 years of taking Nexxium, I was having SERIOUS intestinal regularity problems and discovered it is a side-effect and stopped taking it. Burping resumed.

A naturopath suggested Marsmallow roots tea to calm the intestine, and Aloe Vera juice for the stomach. It was MIRACULOUS!

I took both for years, and was feeling a lot better.

But I couldn't digest Corn in products anymore. I could eat local corn on a cob, but not corn in a ban, or product with corn flour. Odd.

Someone pointed out that Soy and Corn are both Round-Up Ready GMO and that perhaps I react to that, but in Québec, corn on a cob isn't (or wasn't) Round-Up Ready yet so that's why I could.

For a few years, I thought this was the cause of my problems.

but then, Beef was added to the list of things I couldn't digest and they are not GMO. Worse, I seem to be able to digest Veal...

Garlic made the list in a major way at my wife's christmas party when the food had a LOT of garlic and I was seriously sick. I don't normally eat garlic, but I made tests and sure enough, I react to Garlic.

And Oatmeal was added to the list. Then Fructose, so I can't eat Strawberries and more other fruits anymore, as well as almost everything with Fructose in it.

I also can't eat raw carrots but have no problems with cooked carrots. I used to love raw carrots because they are cruchy and HATE cooked ones, but they, I eat what I can...

Then, Magnesium Stearate. It's in small parts in some pills, but if I try a vitamin with it, I have problems, if I take the same vitamin without it, I have fine.

and now, Tomatoes were the last thing added to the list. It might be the fructose, but I used to be able to digest tomatoes fine and now, I can't.

BTW' when I say that I can't digest something, I do a double test: I wait until I am stable in my intestines, and then, eat the thing I want to test for 2 or 3 days to see if I get ""sick"". If I do, I stop (but eat the same thing as for the test period) and see if it stops. If it does, I try it again to ensure it comes back and isn't a fluke.

For tomatoes, I tested it by eating a tomato every Friday at supper and keeping my daily food intake the same. Sure enough, there was a link with how I felt on Saturdays.

At some point, I stopped taking Peanut Butter because I thought that I had problems with Magnesium and there is a lot in it, but I am not to sure. It's not always easy to test food intolerance: it's not like you can eat just one day for 2 days...

Oh, and recently, I ate 5 grams of lactose-free cheese as a test and I didn't have any pain afterwards, but the rest of my intolerances makes it really hard to get a good day now so I am waiting for further tests.

So so, here I am... 

**The list of things I have a food intolerance, in chronological order**

- Soy
- Milk Products, but it could be a local allergy so don't count it, and it might be fixed since
- Bananas
- Corn 
- Beef (but apparently not Veal... odd)
- Garlic
- Oatmeal
- Fructose in many fruits, including my favorite: Strawberries, as well as many things with ""Fructose"" in it
- Raw Carrots (but not cooked ones)
- Magnesium Stearate 
- Tomatoes

So, in short, in the 4 food groups:

1 ) I can't eat almost EVERYTHING from the Milk and substitute group
2 ) I can't eat most of the fruits (but I don't have an exhaustive list since it hurts to try)
3 ) I can't eat beef from the meat group, and possibly peanut butter
4 ) I can't eat Corn or Oatmeal from the Grains group

Fun... That leaves me with only Subway and McDonalds to eat out, and means that otherwise, I can't eat anything that I (or my wife) didn't cook myself. I know cook my own bread to avoid Soy Oil now added in most breads.

Here are things I KNOW I DO NOT have a problem with:

- Pork
- Chicken
- Wheat (I do NOT have a Gluten intolerance... thank God, because I don't know what I would eat otherwise)
- Potatoes
- Cooked Carrots
- Most sugar
- Citrus fruits like Oranges and Clementines
- Rice (so I can take rice milk)

But there are a lot of things in the gray zone. Like apples, can I eat them or is the fructose in them a problem? Etc...


**So my question is: might I be missing something in my diet or vitamins which is a common link?**

For example, let's say I have a vitamin Z4 (I know it doesn't exist) which is normally found in Milk or Soy, and which causes all of the above food intolerances.

I might be missing Vitamin E, but in Canada, only one of the Vitamin E complex is in the pills (The Alpha one) so taking a Vitamin E supplement (I tried) actually makes your Vitamin E levels worse because it depletes the other 3, so I can't test it easily.

I tried some time to time Calcium pills and Vitamin D supplements, but they don't seem to help. My Rice milk has a lot of Calcium and Vitamin D in it and my blood tests show normal Calcium levels.",49.0,8,2014-01-29,PHARMA,0.07528807781636715,0.8934510350227356,0.03126087039709091

biotech,Best ChemE PhD Program for Biotech,"Background: I graduated from a ""top"" University at the top of my class a few years ago (ChemE and BME) and then became the 10th employee at a small biotech startup. I love my job and in the last two years I have had the chance to solve immense technical problems, work with an interdisciplinary group of talented scientists, and do 100 odd jobs such as recruitment and intern supervision. However, in order to pursue my dream of starting a cutting-edge biotech company I feel that I should get my PhD (for various reasons that I would be happy to discuss). So far I have been accepted into MIT, Caltech, Stanford, Berkeley, and UCSB. I am still waiting to hear back from UT Austin.

Does anyone have any experience with chemE departments of the graduate programs I have been accepted into (candid, please!)? Does anyone know the reputation/strength of these programs in the biotech industry (particularly protein and cellular engineering)? Any particular professors I should make a point of talking to? Does anyone have any information on the entrepreneurial atmosphere at these schools?

P.S. I have noticed some interest regarding biotech startups. Although it might derail this thread, feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I have learned quite a bit from my experiences interning and working at biotech startups in Silicon Valley.",5.0,6,2014-01-29,PHARMA,0.030910050496459007,0.9277418255805969,0.0413481667637825
