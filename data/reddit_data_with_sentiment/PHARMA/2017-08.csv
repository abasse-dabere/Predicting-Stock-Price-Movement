medicine,An interesting story about miscommunication in a hospital.,"&gt; ""A critical incident occurred recently at my hospital, involving miscommunication of a patient's location. The event in question was a ‘crash call’ for the hospital medical emergency team to attend a patient on Ward N2. This was announced over the hospital bleep system as “Ward November Two”, as is standard according to the NATO phonetic alphabet. Unfortunately, only one doctor in the on-call team heard this correctly and went straight there. The others (some of whom did not know there was a Ward N2) were confused by the topical male health charity foundation, Movember (see www.movember.com), and went to Ward M2 – at the other end of the hospital site.""

pharmacy,"As a Pharmacy Student, APhA Seems Shady","We are spammed with emails from APhA every week. They are often meaningless non-updates about provider status, but I saw one on Thursday that concerned me. 

The email told me to lobby my senators concerning an amendment from Bernie Sanders about drug importation. The kicker was the claim that this will harm patient safety.

I find this worrisome for multiple reasons:

1. There was no evidence presented in the email. Instead, they are attempting to recruit a massive number of ad hoc lobbyists to talk about an issue without any support, presumably using only their credentials

2. I was curious about the claim, so I did additional research. I found a well-sourced article from Vox (yes, I am aware that they lean left), with quotes such as the following:

""There is nothing whatsoever ‘unsafe’ about drugs approved by Health Canada or most Western European countries, or Japan, or Australia,"" said Jerry Avorn, chief of the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an email. ""There isn't any evidence that citizens of these countries are having any problems with the purity or effectiveness of their medications.""

It also linked other studies, such as this one: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17595307/?i=15&amp;from=canada,%20us,%20drug%20quality,%20comparison

Of course, the pharmaceutical lobby advocates against importation, but the FDA already has mechanisms to do so in case of drug shortages.

Meanwhile, APhA also has lobbied against residents getting overtime pay, yet our school touts APhA membership as a virtual pre-requisite for being in the program.

I know there are larger problems that the aforementioned amendment will not solve, and that in many ways it is a token gesture that won't meaningfully affect drug prices, but I am also a neophyte in this profession.

medicine,Do you sign off on verbal orders that you didn't give?,"I'm a physician who works in a single-specialty group where when you're on, you're on; when you're off, you're off.

Any patient we admit remains under our name for the duration of the admission, which leads to residents/nurses/whoever incorrectly attributing verbal orders or orders requiring co-signature to me.  Sometimes, I haven't been involved in the patient's care in weeks.  I've previously expressed discomfort to my division head re: this practice.

How this came to a head: I was on vacation.  I came back to orders for BZDs, restraints, etc., all under me, awaiting co-signature.  I declined all of those orders - I don't feel comfortable signing for those red-flag type of things when I have no idea re: their appropriateness for that patient.

At that point, the orders were correctly reassigned by IT to my partner who gave them.  When they showed up in his in-box, he called me ""lazy"" and ""passive-aggressive"" at a group meeting for not signing them. My boss backed him, and said we need to sign the orders assigned to us, whether we gave them or not.

I'm uncomfortable with the situation.  The ""everyone does it, so it's ok"" logic makes me squeamish.  The idea of being blamed for the negative result of an order I didn't give makes me even more so.

Does anyone here have any experience with the medicolegal ramifications or Joint Commission ramifications of signing restraint/narcotic/bzd etc orders that they did not give?  Thoughts on the situation?  I'd hate to stand my ground for no reason - maybe this isn't all that big of a deal, maybe this isn't a hill to die on?

I also should mention - there are other suggestions I gave to my boss - several times before this became an open issue: we update the name of the care team/attending so the orders go to the correct person.  (No, ""too much work."")  We hold staff accountable to put the name of the correct provider in for orders (no, ""too difficult to track."")

pharmacy,Can I call Poison Control as a pharmacist?,"I had a patient and his dad come in over the weekend. The kid normally takes 18 mg Concerta, but they ran out and had some 5 mg IR tabs lying around. The dad had the smart idea of giving the child 3.5 x 5 to get 17.5 mg.

They stopped by the pharmacy because the mom was concerned the kids heart might explode or something by taking IR instead of ER, since the drug dumps all at the same time instead of releasing slowly over time.

I told the dad I wasn't sure and really had no way of knowing for sure whether it was safe or not. I would think a young and healthy kid who has been taking Methylphenidate previously would be OK, but again, I wasn't sure. I gave them the number for Poison Control and told them to call, since they deal with this kind of issue all the time and could probably provide a more definitive answer.

Any pharmacists want to weigh in on how I handled this? Would you have done anything differently?

As the title suggests, I am also curious if it is appropriate / acceptable for me to call on behalf of the patient? I have never called Poison Control myself, I was sort of under the impression that it is for patients to call on their own when they are having a potential emergency.

What i am looking for are examples of antibiotic protocols that your institutions have. Such as therapeutic changes double coverage, length of infusions and duration of treatment. 

I know its hospital specific and i just want an idea of what other hospitals do. I want my protocols to be a concise as possible and i don't want to look incompetent by forgetting something or doing it incorrectly. 


So far my protocols involve switching zosyn to a 4hr infusion Q8hr and to have all double anaerobic coverage switched. When i started i could not believe the amount of zosyn + metro for intra abdominal infections i was seeing when i started. 

If you dont want to post it publicly i understand or if you want to PM me that would be great. You can even cover your hospitals name if you want. I am just looking for ideas and examples of what other hospitals do. 

Currently this is the only one i have and can find right now and its outdated by about 10 years

I've seen family members in such situations visited by three/four nurses and one/two doctors who do the same thing: look at the affected area, ask the patient what happened, listen to the heart. Wouldn't one MD and one nurse be enough in many cases? (Or starting with one of each, and adding more experts if the condition appears more serious?)

medicine,"Walking through my hospital, had a small epiphany moment.","This may not exactly by earth-shattering for others on this sub, but I wanted to share my experience nonetheless.

I'm an (extremely) junior doctor working in a tertiary level centre. I haven't exactly enjoyed every day of my job, and 1 year in, it's often been difficult to see the bigger picture, when 90% of the day is scribing for seniors, venipuncture, and secretarial work. It sounds trite, but it's not the unwell patients that wear you down; they prepared us for those in medical school. It's the ongoing drudgery.

With that in mind and rolling into a new rotation, I think it's fair to say I was feeling a bit disillusioned. 

During my shift I had to top up batteries for the pager, from the other side of the hospital. I took a shortcut through A&amp;E, through the waiting room, minors, into the corridor. I saw a trauma patient being rushed to theatres, surrounded by doctors. I passed x-ray, wards, department after department. In my mind things finally started to click.

It's easy to see the hospital as a building with a few hundred beds, with different specialties doing their own thing, and damned be to anyone else. It's easy to get angry at the A&amp;E clerking and why on earth someone got tazocin. I had been seeing the hospital in brief episodes; patients arrive Over There, then they come to us, we do something and then we send them Somewhere Else. Finally I think I'm seeing it as a machine, with all the departments working together for the best needs of the patient.

Obviously the machine doesn't always work the best, and it isn't going to stop departments quarrelling with each other, but I've started to realise my place in the machine, at least for the time being until I can do something more fulfilling.",45,223,2017-08-12,PHARMA,0.05155634880065918,0.9105254411697388,0.03791821375489235

medicine,Internal medicine resident having regrets about not doing surgery,"Trying to pose this question in an open-ended way to see what people think..

Basically I was between medicine and surgery for a lot of med school. Ultimately I'm probably most interested in cardiology, so can see myself going down the interventional route. I've been doing cardiology rotations which have been rewarding and challenging, but I can't help but miss being ""hands on"". I feel I'm managing chronic conditions and I'm trying to be thoughtful about what I do, but I miss the acuity of surgery sometimes. Like if a patient needs ECMO or something we just kind of stand aside while surgeons fix the problem. 

I know a lot of valve work is likely going to interventional cards folks, but it's not to shake the idea that surgeons may eventually be better for those procedures. Like when shit hits the fan, you need a surgeon in there ASAP so it seems to make more sense to just have a surgeon do TAVR, etc rather than surgeon plus interventionalist. Plus there are times when you need a cut-down and the interventionalist can't do that. 

I don't know what to do with where I'm at. For example I feel like a bad resident knowing that I don't like gen med stuff at all - I enjoy being mindful and spending time thinking about patients (which I felt I was sometimes missing in surgery), but some of the ""thinking about the differential"" stuff for the sake of thinking about it isn't really exciting for me. Like I prefer to just see a problem, figure it out, and fix it, and I feel like some of the workflow and processing we do in medicine is inefficient and a waste of time (thinking about things for sake of thinking about them). I basically picked medicine because there's a lot you can do with the training, and I felt a career in surgery would kill any sense of a healthy work/life balance and I want to be around for my family.

I guess I'm curious if anyone has any relevant experience or thoughts to add.. would really appreciate hearing some other opinions",79,43,2017-08-12,PHARMA,0.08611835539340973,0.8867258429527283,0.027155844494700432

pharmacy,Vyvanse 20 mg QA problems,"I was verifying a vyvanse 20 capsule Rx today and came across some irregularities in the capsules that I have not seen before.

For the past year of being a pharmacist every vyvanse for the multitude of strengths have always had the ""s489"" that lines up with the strength. (Within a margin of error) The ones I checked today were in no consistent order, some lined up like normal, some completely flipped and some at any degree variation from the s489.

My thoughts are that either the hopper was loaded incorrectly at the factory or that there could be diversion that occurred somewhere.

Am I blowing this out of proportion or should I contact the company to inquire about this? The lot is AG2790B, exp 12/2019.

UPDATE: haven't heard anything from DM, but I did look into it more and noticed that it seems they have two different plants that make vyvanse for them (shire).  On the labels it states ""manufactured for Shire"", the bottles with the consistent imprints are the ones that are numbers only for the lot number and leave a paper/glue spot on the cap when you take off the info sheet.  The inconsistent one uses the rubber glue on the cap that comes off clean, has letters in the lot, and the lot is found in a black box.

UPDATE 2: spoke with a QA specialist at Shire and she stated something along the lines ""Shire does not require manufacturers to put imprints on the same side of the capsule"".  She also indirectly confirm there's at least 2 manufacturers, noted by the difference in labels, imprint, color hue of capsule.

Full story:
I gave a short course of indomethicin 50mg TID-prn x 3 days to a 70 year old guy with really bad worsening gout for 2 weeks at a walk in clinic. I ran bloodwork too and it turns out his eGFR isn't great at around 40 (Creat 163, K:4.5) (no Hx of prior kidney disease) and I also saw he's on warfarin for a valve. 

I've started to lose some sleep over this as I tried to call him to tell him to stop the indomethicin but couldn't reach him. This was Tuesday (5 days ago) and all I know is that he's not currently admitted at our hospital.

medicine,Traumatic vs. atraumatic neurosurgery,"I'm a paramedic in a busier urban system, and I had a situation occur recently that confused me.

Hospital A is a Level 1 trauma center that also offers stroke services. 

Hospital B offers no Trauma services, but is the regional stroke center and offers a full range of neurologic/neurosurgical services (*per their own promotional materials*) 

My Patient was a 72M that was hit by a motorcycle and struck his head, resulting in bilateral subdural hematomas. He went to Hospital B.

Hospital B's ED attending Physicians were not pleased that I had brought them a trauma patient, stating ""We don't do trauma"". The patient was transferred to Hospital A. I was a little surprised, because I've brought them patients with a head bleed secondary to a fall (from standing) before, and they didn't react this way.

My rationale for transporting my patient to Hospital B was that he had no apparent injuries aside from his head injuries, and was exhibiting signs consistent with a TBI (confusion, perseveration, remarkable HTN, and a large hematoma in his left temporal region). Hospital B was also significantly closer. 

I'm honestly pretty ignorant of the scope of each speciality- I'm not sure if Trauma Surgeons perform neurosurgery, or if there's a sub-speciality within neurosurgery for TBI's due to the unique pathophysiology. 

I'm aware that the ED at hospital B could have been concerned with occult internal bleeding that would have complicated the situation, but they still decided to transfer my patient after numerous CT's/X-rays were performed and revealed only the isolated SDH's, so I felt that there was probably more to the situation than I could understand. All of my attempts to clarify this have resulted in ED staff at Hospital B repeating the mantra ""We don't do trauma"". 

Could someone clarify if there is a point where neurosurgery diverges and trauma surgery is more appropriate? If so, where is that point? What findings should I be more concerned with that would alert me to this (besides mechanism)?

I'd like to add that I'm not trying to disparage the Hospital or its staff, I'm just trying to understand better so that I can avoid creating unnecessary work in the future and optimize patient care.   

I appreciate your time and feedback.

edit: spelling

edit 2: I'm really grateful for the feedback from everyone. Getting a multifaceted response from multiple disciplines has helped me understand this case better. It should go without saying that my future care will reflect this. As a much wiser person than I once said:

medicine,What would you consider to be an issue with a resident? How would you deal with it?,"We often tell residents to just keep their head down and tough it out. I feel that that is the wrong way to go about the issue. It just leads to resentment over time and allows the negativity to build up. The source of the issue isnt identified and often grows with time going from bad to worse. A resident should be able to speak up and raise concerns. On the other hand attendings who are poor managers/instructors shouldn't teach or should be held accountable in some manner.       

Usually I hear attendings say its an ""attitude problem"" with a resident. However its such a nebulous term, it could mean anything really. If an attending says a resident has an attitude issue I just understand it to be an issue a particular attending has with a resident that they have now labelled a character flaw. However, character flaws don't just pop up. In an inherently inequal power dynamic an attending can negatively characterize a resident while they cannot defend themselves at all. Sometimes its something the attending has instigated and the resident reacted poorly under not so ideal circumstances.           

If I notice an issue with a resident I try and understand the issues leading upto it. More often than not its an attending or an institutional issue. If multiple residents are having ""attitude"" problems I seriously start questioning that idea that its an issue with the residents themselves.   

So I would like to hear from other attendings, chiefs and senior residents. What do you identify as an ""issue"" or an ""attitude problem"" with a resident? How do you deal with it? How effective is it?   

Edit: I had originally made a post that addressed both sides of the issue. However, I felt it was too broad and decided that to keep things organized and coherent it was best to start with this side of the discussion and then hear the other side of the problem in a separate post. To talk about how residents can work to improve their own programs and not face backlash for it.

I have anxiety and have been prescribed a daily anxiety medication as well as a benzo for panic attacks. (It's like xanax). I do not take the benzo very often and when I do it's such a small dose that I do not feel ""high"". I've never taken it at work. 

My place of work was a pharmacy. I did not work in the pharmacy portion I was just a cashier for other things the store sells (cosmetics, food, otc medication etc). Once I started working there I began getting my prescription filled at the pharmacy there. The owner of the store is also the head pharmacist. At one point she was the one who filled my prescription. When this happened she acted completely normal. 

A few days later the manager called me into the office to say I was being fired at the owners request, she told me she could not tell me why since the owner didn't tell her anything other than that it was ""confidential"". I thought it was strange I was getting fired without being told why so I pressed a bit. She just kept saying she could not tell me since even she didn't know. It was confidential. The owner was on vacation at this time. I left and handed in my uniform. 

I went back to the store when I knew the owner would be back to ask her why I had been fired. She seemed annoyed that I had showed up but told me it was because she could not have someone working there who was in frequent possession of a controlled substance. I could understand if she thought maybe I had it illegally but she obviously knew that wasn't the case since she was the one who filled the prescription??

Mid-50s female presents to ED s/p fall from bed, landing on her buttocks. Similar fall 1 week prior resulted in T12 &amp; L2 compression fx. She was scheduled for kyphoplasty 3 days from this visit.

I go through her PMH, meds, Dxs, and vitals show BP 132/78, HR 87, RR 14, Sp02 92, T 99.2. ECG NSR.

I go see her, she hurts where I expected, no red flags. Chest/lungs sound good. Belly soft NDNT. Neuro/vascular intact. Order thoracic/lumbar/sacral plain films. No changes. She is in a lot of pain (lower back). After the first IV pain med, I reevaluate and her pulse ox is 91 with good waveform. Time goes by, NeuroSurg wants to admit her, give another dose of IV pain meds. Nurse finds me, looks concerned, and tells me the patient was in the high 80s and they put 3L by NC on her, and she only improved to 93.

medicine,Xenophobic-ish comments from a minority patient . Not sure how to feel about this.,"Background: I work in a city hospital that serves a very impoverished minority population . Our Institution isn't exactly stellar  , so except for Radiology and Surgery most of our residents and staff are FMGs or IMGs.  Me (FMG) and my posse ( Mostly FMGs)were doing our rounds. Being a Sunday , out team was providing cross-coverage and we had a lot of patients to round on. 

We make to the ED to examine a patient who had come in with shortness of breath and  diagnosed with a PE. The patient was a black transgender patient. She had been in the ED for a couple of hours 

The moment I stepped in the room my spidey-sense started tingling. Started off rough enough "" who are you ? why Are you here ? Why are  you rounding so late?.I'm short of breath"" ( while screaming at the top of her lungs).  Ma'am . I had 30 patients. i needed to prioritize , but you have my attention now . 

She explained that she was basically ignored by the nurse ( which was true - was not hooked up to telemetry or SO2 monitoring ).
I apologized to her and told her I would talk to the nurse and that she should take it up the charge nurse. So far nothing usual. 
Then she went off on a tirade  ."" My mother worked in this hospital ,I also worked in healthcare . Used to come here sometimes until I started getting my care in  *Brand name * Hospital . This hospital was  much better run when we had Real American Doctors, not all these foreign doctors."" She repeats this stament verbatim again during the course of the encounter. 

Now my interns and resident are visibly disturbed. But she goes on . About how her usual hospital is much better.  I then remind her BTW, I'm also foreign ( my phenotypic  ethnicity is ambiguous- on a good day I can pass off for Hispanic/Italian . I was called "" white trash "" once ).

In order to diffuse the situation , I agree with all her comments. I  put in a few negative comments about my own hospital( I find this works very  well to calm down a an angry patient/family )  This eventually calms her down , and I manage to get a coherent history and physical exam.
 
By the end of the encounter I tell her "" Ma'am, I'm sorry you couldn't get a real american doctor today "". She then suddenly becomes apologetic.  ""Oh, I didn't  mean all foreign doctors are bad . Just like the cops you have good ones and bad ones  . You all have been very professional . ""

I shake her hand and the encounter ends.

I don't know how to feel about all this. My training tells me that the outburst was probably a reaction to the stress of being in a hospital and mistreatment by the ED nurse. She did apologize in the end ( cant vouch for the sincerity of it  though ) . She herself belongs to a very marginalized group ( Black M-to-F transgender ) but had no qualms or second thoughts about espousing xenophobic comments.

medicine,How to document provider notification - query from a nursing student.,"Hey all -

I've been lurking meddit for a long time. I have learned so much from the discourse and research explored here. I have a question that may seem simple: I have gathered - and completely understand why - that this sort of progress/patient note is frustrating:

""Patient X with HR sustaining in the 140s throughout shift. No c/o SOB/CP. MD Y notified, no orders received.""

I understand that it feels like a CYA move by nursing, and as the kid of a hospital risk manager, I understand it introduces legal vulnerability. However, ultimately we do all have to document in a way that protects us and makes it clear we are intervening for the patient.

So, would this be an appropriate way to document the same thing?

""Patient X with HR sustaining in the 140s throughout shift. Patient with no complaints of CP/SOB. MD Y notified. Plan is to continue with Q4 VS, continuous telemetry monitoring, Q8 hour physical assessments, and ordered metoprolol. Will continue to evaluate pt and communicate with physician. No distress noted.""

...or something similar. Imperfect note, I am not a provider and don't write orders obviously, but I think you catch my drift. I just want to be able to accurately communicate without throwing anybody under a bus. Apologies if the baseline example is weak, I'm still learning. :) Thanks for reading!",63,24,2017-08-20,PHARMA,0.03281647339463234,0.9094985723495483,0.05768493562936783

medicine,How do you deal with the ethics of medicine as a business in the U.S.,"Hey everyone, 2nd year resident here in EM residency at a hospital in the Midwest, using a throwaway just in case. On top the tough hours of residency I've been having a real hard time dealing with the business atmosphere of medicine that seems to permeate almost every aspect of U.S. healthcare. I think most of us go into medicine wanting to help heal people and to make their lives better, but so many times I feel like I'm just abusing the public for money. The turnover and under-staffing in my hospital is ridiculous, cases get pushed through the OR at breakneck pace to try to get as much money as possible, 89 year getting unnecessary procedures that don't do anything to improve their quality of life. I realize that maybe I was naive and idealistic when I was younger and this is part of becoming an adult but I'm getting really burnt out and it sometimes feels ridiculous. Medicine is expensive and hospitals need money to operate but surely there is a better way to do it than what we do now.

I am a single, female Family Medicine resident about to graduate next spring and looking at job offers. I have approx 450k in med school debt all through the Fed. Am doing PSLF through residency right now and have been paying the whole time. So 7 years left after I get out.

I was doing math to calculate take home pay after taxes and budget with attending pay. I am shocked how hard you get hit 1) being single and living alone and 2) how horrible it is that community health pays the least. Based on cost of living in my area, it seems I would need to make 130k in order to have money in my budget to save for anything after expenses, taxes, and loans. 

So, I'm wondering if any other single, living alone Family Med physicians out there are doing finance-wise, what decisions they made for job, budgeting, etc.

medicine,"Do reviews of you on websites like HealthGrades, vitals.com, and Yelp matter?","I just googled myself and found a brand new absolutely scathing review of myself, the second of its kind. Both such reviews of me are fairly specific in their accusations, and criticize specifically my chops at medicine, not side items like the politeness of my receptionist or my punctuality.

This most recent one-star gem goes a step further, and makes a claim that is factually untrue: that I was ""let go of"" from my most recent job, when I actually resigned voluntarily. The reviewer took the time to write this review months after he transferred out of my care, which tells me two things. First, he's still got some serious beef with me, and second, word on the street is rife that I actually left in disgrace.

I've received starkly contrasting advice about the significance of online reviews to my career prospects. Some websites claim I should be googling myself regularly and promptly and diplomatically addressing any negative reviews. Others claim there is no point to me even reading them at all, as there are many potential patients worth having who see these for the unreliable sources they are. What's your take?

Please note that I'd rather not copypaste these reviews of me onto this forum verbatim, because I value my online privacy very highly.

As a pharmacist, my studies and practice have always been if Ali  develops, to dose by levels and monitor more closely. However, it seems the culture at my hospital with ID providers and even nephrologists is that vancomycin needs to be stopped and changed to linezolid, daptomycin, or ceftarolene (depending on indication). This can be increasingly frustrating from a stewardship point of view and trying to restrict these abx to only use when absolutely necessary.  This is done even when there are other probable causes of AKI. 

Is this a regular practice for you? I understand there is literature showing connections between vancomycin and AKI but I believe this is more so when there isn't much monitoring involved. Ours is a pharmacist dosing service, so if renal function begins to decline, random levels are checked and dosing by levels is initiated very quickly.

medicine,Did ego play a role in your career choices?,"I know it’s a loaded, delicate question. Hell, it may not even be a very *good* question.  But it’s something I find myself coming back to often. I think the official, party line answer as to why a person goes into medicine is some variation on: ""I liked science/people/learning new things/the idea of helping people/career stability/satisfying work/other positive notions.""

And that’s not *wrong*. It was true when I started out as a medical student, and it’s still true now as I slog through fellowship. The thing is, I also like the idea of *myself* as a doctor. I don’t introduce myself as Dr. MyName, but I can’t help but enjoy the notion that it applies to me. There's that knowledge that I *could*, if I wanted to, you know? 

I suppose what I’m getting at is this: MD/DO is a title that’s (to one degree or another) equated with a lot of things: being smart, being accomplished, being useful to society, being a good person, etc. That may be diminishingly true as time goes on, but I think it’s still the general perception as of right now. I’m not sure there’s another title that confers that sort of… I don’t know, respect?

(Just writing that felt a little gross – which is the point I’m driving at, I suppose.)

Like you, I didn’t go into all of this for the sake of my own ego. But I can’t say that ego had *nothing* to do with it either. I didn’t just love the idea of medicine, after all. I’ve loved the idea of being a doctor – of being the one who figured out the diagnosis, or who did the thing that mattered – since I was 8 years old. It's not just job satisfaction, I'm almost sure.

I think we all dance around the idea of ego a little in medicine. Certainly the few times I’ve tried to bring it up with colleagues, there’s been a lot of hesitation and non-answering. And I get it; we’re supposed to be altruists, and nobody wants to rock that particular boat. 

Still, I’m awfully curious. Maybe this is just navel-gazing, and maybe it isn’t. How much of a role did ego play in your career choices?

medicine,Calling time of death in a pt you never cared for [question],"Quick background, I'm an ER doc and like most hospitals I have to cover the whole hospital at night for any codes, intubations, central lines, etc...
I had a request the other day to go upstairs to pronounce somebody on the floor.  I never cared for this patient and had nothing to do with his care at all.  He was a DNR and no code was run so I had no idea he had even died until the call.  Because he was intubated (I'm assuming family said no advancement of care once he was already tubed) apparently they couldn't extubate and wanted me to call him.  
I felt pretty uncomfortable about this for the reasons stated above.  Am I being unreasonable here? Has anybody ever been in this situation? Does your hospital have this policy of intubated patients needing to be called by the EP instead of the hospitalist?
