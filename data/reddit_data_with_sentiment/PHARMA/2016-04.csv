The Bariatric Embolization of Arteries for the Treatment of Obesity trial (BEAT Obesity) involved injecting microscopic beads into blood vessels supplying the fundus of the stomach to decrease blood flow, via a image-guided catheter from the groin/wrist. This lead to reduced secretion of ghrelin, suppressed hunger signals, reduced appetite and therefore weight loss.

The seven severely obese patients involved had a BMI of 40-60. Subjects were tracked at 1, 3 and 6 month periods. There were no major adverse events. The 1st month average excess weight loss (% loss of weight above ideal body weigh) was 5.9%, the 6 month average excess weight loss was 13.3%.

As the statement mentions, these early results seem to show good effectiveness for this intervention while being less invasive/faster to recover from than gastric bypass.

Sorry about not being an actual paper, it doesn't seem to have been published yet- but the researchers did publish a literature review back in May 2015: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105104431500024X",13,41,2016-04-05,PHARMA,0.33130326867103577,0.6383283138275146,0.03036840632557869

As a graduate student with good grades (&gt;3.7) and good mcat and gre scores, I am faced with the decision of medical school or physician assistant school. I have shadowed doctors and I have shadowed PAs. I like both. I originally viewed the choice as right or wrong, but lately I think I could be happy doing either.

Being a community of a wide range of healthcare professionals, I want to ask how you have noticed the lifestyle differences between the two professions. Of course, I know it depends on specialty, location, desire to work, etc., but generally speaking, does the PA flexibility afford as much freedom and time as the majority seem to lead on? 

I have heard of PAs that make more and work more hours than MDs, but how close to a reality is this for most PAs? Personally, I am interested in pediatrics, preferably something involving inpatient/hospital care.

So I tell this individual that nothing was called in for the patient which she then states that she's picking up for her friend and she's a physician so she would like to call/write the prescription in for the patient on one of our pharmacy rx pads that we use for verbal. I see no issue with it  at first since usually physicians that do it write for a maintenance med or an antibiotic and my pharmacist gives the go ahead. The pharmacist double checks her credentials (DEA, office number, address, ID, etc) and gives her the pad to write down the prescription pad to write.  I then go ahead and grab the pad after she's done to input it then notice she's wrote for Xanax 1mg BID #20. Something didn't feel right so I go show my pharmacist and the physician states that the patient is a friend of hers and she's just on the way to her house and was gonna pick it up for her.  Red flags instantly shoot up for me and even though we verified this was a MD we decided to deny to fill the prescription because none of us felt comfortable with it.

medicine,What do I do when I know I'm not good enough?,"Without giving too many details, I'm an MD in the tail end of training. I completed residency and am now winding up a fellowship, and I feel flatly incompetent. While I have not yet made any major mistakes that have led to patient harm (that I know of), I can't seem to keep a firm grasp on even the basics of my discipline. I've had many years of training but often it seems like I know less than a PGY-1. I know that I'm an intelligent and capable person and yet I feel like I can't even keep my head above water. I don't know how to explain it other than to say that I don't have a knack for this and I'm increasingly worried about what's going to happen in the future when I'm no longer under any kind of supervision. When I have tenuously broached this issue with faculty in the past, I have been reassured that I am performing at expectations, but I really think this reflects the fact that I am *diligent* rather than *competent*. This is causing me a great amount of stress and while I don't believe myself to be depressed, I do struggle with feelings of worthlessness because of the issue. I *like* my job and I really, really wish I was good at, but if I weren't saddled with outrageous debt I probably would have sought another career some time ago. It seems like I just picked the wrong job. I feel trapped in this trajectory even though it seems inevitable that I am going to cause real damage to someone. I don't know what to do.

medicine,Interesting story about a patient calling in their own meds.,"So my friend who works for a corporate pharmacy had a funny story to tell me. So there is a pt at his pharmacy 60ish y/o AA female Who picks up metformin 1000 bid #180 every 90 days. Her patient profile shows she has been taking metformin for 9 years same sig and MD with the occasional cipro/Zpak/medrol/proair and she has never taken a control. So last week one of the techs got lazy and sent out an auto refill request to her MD. The MD calls back next day and says the PT has never been with them before and it must be a mistake. The pharmacist gets curious and looks at her profile and sees that every script has been called in by the same person and same MD for the past 9ish years. So yesterday he gets a call and its for this same pt calling in a 90 day metformin script. 

Long story short he asks for the MD and proceeded to tell her what happened a few days before. The she hung up instantly and he has never heard from her again. 


This probably happens more often than not and its almost impossible to catch. Our theory is she is probably an ex nurse or pharm tech who could not afford to go to an MD. Also there was no insurance on file.

I was accepted to my dream medical school after taking a gap year to work. I am planning to take an additional year ""off"" before matriculating and I wanted to know if you guys have any suggestions for the skills (hard or soft skills) and knowledge (problems with healthcare) that I should focus on developing in this additional year. I want to be the best doctor I can be and I feel like I do not currently have the sufficient experience/maturity to fully take advantage of the amazing resources that medical school has to offer. I would like to develop myself before diving into my medical career. Talking to the dean, he said that taking an additional year may actually make my ""career"" faster as I will have a better idea of what I want to do in medical school.
I am currently working a healthcare consulting company and I would like one more year to build my expertise in the healthcare ecosystem - I am thinking of pursuing healthcare policy/management research instead of wet lab work in the future. I have a wonderful set of friends and I am truly enjoying life right now - I know I will always regret not spending as much time as possible with them before leaving.
Please let me know if you have any suggestions! I especially love to read, so any books about medicine or healthcare you can suggest would be wonderful! I am a huge fan of Atul Gawande and Ezekiel, and love reading MD memoirs (When Breath Becomes Air, When Air Hits the Brain, My Home Country). Thank you all!

medicine,"Doctor parents, what should we keep in our home first aid supply?","On our first trip to my parents' house when we were dating, I busted my lip open and my husband glued it shut with liquid band aid, convincing my mom not to take me to the hospital. Fast forward six years and we're currently preparing for our first baby, which will come a few months before my husband matches (hopefully to ER!). 

The other day my husband mentioned that one of the attendings on his peds rotation had to bring their kid to the clinic to check for an ear infection because they didn't have an otoscope at home. He thought that was kind of silly, and got to thinking about what simple tools and supplies we should keep at home so that he can treat or triage our kids. I have a feeling we're going to need more than liquid band aid, although that's definitely on the list.

So, what's in your Dr. Dad/Mom arsenal? As we're registering for a bunch of lame baby stuff, I want to get him some fun toys he'll enjoy more than the myriad swaddling blankets and breast pump paraphernalia that's going to fill our registry.

I just had a random memory of when I was in college and I had an illness with a wicked sore throat, fevers, cervical lymph nodes so swollen and painful that I woke up crying in the night after the ibuprofen wore off, and then a strange left sided abdominal pain.  The throat pain and LAD lasted about a week, the abdominal pain about a month.  When I went to the school's NP, she said that it looked like I had strep and she did a swab, which was negative so she then told me that I had probably had ""some virus"", but she sent me to a local lab to get a CBC in case it was something nastier.  My white cells were elevated with a monocyte predominance.  However, by the time that she saw the results, the throat and lymph node pain were significantly better, and she emailed me to say that it looks like I had some bacterial infection, but since I was getting better, she wasn't going to prescribe anything for it.  For the record, this NP was notorious among the students for being terrible and missing obvious things.

This morning, I had a random memory of that illness and how awful I felt, and it suddenly all clicked and I thought ""oh shit, I had mono!""

On the one hand in practical terms there's no real reason for a doctor to need a degree in biochemistry/biology/whatever as they're never going to use the majority of that knowledge in clinical practice. It also saves you a few years of your life (and the associated debt) that comes with being a sudent for longer.

But there is a graduate-entry medical course at my uni as well, and the graduate students just seem much more prepared and motivated to be doctors. Some people also think they make better doctors. [Link removed]

medicine,"""Primum non nocere - First, do no harm..."" For those of you unsure about the upcoming English junior doctor strikes","*Primum non nocere.* ~~The opening line of~~ **A seperate principle often mistakenly attributed to** the Hippocratic oath. The vow we all take when we start practicing. *First, do no harm.*

In the coverage of the English junior doctor strikes, particularly the full walkout scheduled for next week (where emergency care is withdrawn for the first time ever) I have seen this sentiment passed around by the political right and unconvinced public. They claim that as doctors we cannot walk out of our posts as we will be breaking our own first and foremost rule. 

Many colleagues and supporters are arguing that there will be no patients at risk during this strike. That our consultants will fully pick up the slack, morbidity and mortality will not get worse during our walkout and that we are not harming any patients. 

But this is wrong. Patients *will* be at risk and patients *will* be harmed. **They always are.** Maybe no more than a regular day, but it will happen none the less. You see, ~~our Hippocratic oath~~ **the principle** is wrong. As doctors we harm patients every single day. Iatrogenesis, surgical scars, side effects, allergic reactions, primary complications, secondary complications, hospital acquired infections. Almost all of what we do comes with a caveat of ""this is what could go wrong"" even when done perfectly within the most skilled hands. Inevitably we do sometimes cause harm, or even death.

Therefore a more appropriate ~~opening line~~ **principle** should be - *Take the path of least harm*.

As doctors we are experts in risk-benefit analysis. For everything we do we weigh up the pro's and the con's, deciding finally if the potential harm is worth the potential benefit. We weigh up the potential harm of doing nothing against the potential harm of doing something, and that has reflected over into our decision to strike. The new contract being imposed risks our healthcare system being destroyed. Not enough doctors to run a full service, and those we do have spread so thin they cannot deliver care to every patient. Extreme rationing of the services available, and half the funding going from the taxpayer into poorly run private firms. Longer and longer waiting lists. Patients dying before they get treatment. Exhausted medics that make mistakes. A demoralised and depressed workforce that has long given up. More doctors leaving for greener pastures and less and less top level students applying to medical school every year, continuously reducing the standard of care patients recieve. The impact of this contract is about more than just 'Saturday pay' as the media wants people to believe, it opens the floodgates for the NHS' collapse and puts the health of the population in considerable risk. 

Even if the two days of consultant cover does put patients at increased risk of harm (which it doesn't, but is a story for another day) it is grossly outweighed by the risk of letting this government have its way with our NHS.

In medicine harm is inevitable. 

*Take the path of least harm.* 

That is what we're doing.

(For the record, this was not wholly my idea. I saw a recent post on Facebook that explained the same idea, I just couldn't find it again to copy &amp; paste or post so I've said it in my own words. Credit to the unknown original writer!)

pharmacy,Pharmacy- the worst decision of my life (Australia),"When I first applied to pharmacy school I was all bright eyed and delusional. Now that I've graduated I feel empty both intellectually and emotionally, spent by the dredging of day-to-day pharmacy life. I've had my fill of pharmacy as a profession. Yes, I help the odd patient and I do try still to give everybody who wants it my time. But I feel like this is not what I signed up for. I sincerely urge everyone thinking about pharmacy as a profession do as much work experience as they possibly can before even applying to pharmacy school. You need to know the downsides. I've been practicing for awhile now and am in the large cohort of twenty-somethings who make up the majority of the workforce. I've tried to in various ways make the most out of this profession, and have worked both in hospital and community. I've done post-graduate clinical study because it's the most helpful in practice and keeps you in the know about drugs (MClinPharm). I have done home medicine reviews (HMRs) after I became accredited and I still have  problems with the profession in terms of identity. The truth is I see people that are being poorly managed and I can't help them, because the amount of weight my opinion has in the world of healthcare seems to be overlooked. Pharmacy at least in Australia is downtrodden constantly. We know drugs, this is excellent but even in hospital settings it was nurses who were tasked with things like warfarin counselling in the public sector. That is ridiculous, and  prescribing rights even go to nurses now. The absolute lack of faith the public have in pharmacists as a profession is abhorrent, we're highly trained health professionals. Clearly with this in mind it's pretty obvious why there has not been huge waves in new responsibilities for pharmacists. This is only matched with an over-supply of graduates that are quite young, reduced payments from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and reduction in wages. I would only advise the very brave and dedicated to take this on as a profession.

medicine,Best country to work in as junior doctor?,"I'm an international student at med school in the UK doing my clinicals at the moment and was seriously thinking about whether I should actually stay on to work in this country after I finish my degree. 

I do love medicine and I wouldn't have applied to medical school if it was actually about the money; but with what's happening with the junior doctor contracts at the moment, the prospect of long, (even more) undercompensated working hours with inefficient, understaffed patient care systems that the government doesn't give a damn about, probably isn't going to appeal to anyone relatively sane. 

After graduation, I'm rather lucky in the sense that I'm quite flexible with where I end up working, since I don't intend on returning to my home country. Malaysia is kinda a clusterfuck right now. So my choices are: staying on in the UK, or moving to the USA/Canada, Aussie/NZ or Europe. With all the horror stories about insane working hours and stress and physicians having the highest rate of suicide amongst professions, the only reason I'm considering America is that my boyfriend would prefer to work there. Canada is also terribly hard for IMGs to match into their system apparently, unless you're a superstar (I'm only a red dwarf, ha ha.) 

Aussie and New Zealand sound pretty damn awesome according to doctors that moved there for work—reasonable hours that hospitals have to stick to, sane rotas and a proper work-life balance; same goes for Europe (well, the affluent countries I suppose). I know it's not a doctor-ish thing to say but I really need sleep to function—or at least the semblance of enough sleep. I would love to stay in the UK (since I want to do research as well) provided the NHS doesn't continue its downward spiral—does anyone foresee the Tories having a change of heart?

pharmacy,Pharmacy student feel like I have inadequate pharmacy knowledge and burden my co-workers.,"I'm a pharmacy student in Toronto, finishing my 2nd year of studies. I have some experience working in a pharmacy, I currently volunteer at a pharmacy part-time and also finished placements last summer. Sometimes I feel inadequate about my pharmacy knowledge while working in a pharmacy. Even though there are certain subjects that I covered in school, I'm not always able to apply it practise. For example, I can't remember some of the side effects of a particular drug or all the counselling points by memory. Is this a common feeling among students or pharmacists? I feel like we are fed so much information in school, that I can't remember all of it and haven't yet figured out what is relevant in a practical setting. 

Because of feeling inadequate with my pharmacy knowledge compared to some pharmacists at my workplace, I sometimes feel like I'm a burden on the pharmacists when I ask a lot of questions. And I feel like the technicians get annoyed when I'm slow at tasks. And of course my self-esteem takes some major hits. Is this a common feeling, which will go away over time as I get more experience?

medicine,Options for MDs who don't want to do residency or practice clinically.,"Hey there everyone. This question is actually on behalf of someone I know. She isn't a part of Reddit and doesn't want to join to ask this, so I'm doing it for her.

She's going to graduate med school soon but doesn't think she wants to do a residency anymore. She wants to get an MPH and work at things on a more policy and systems based level. For instance, she's very interested in diabetes and is currently working on research projects involving medication compliance in extremely low income type 2 diabetics. She doesn't see the patients, she works with the data. 

Is not doing a residency actually the smart way to go? Google searches haven't been super productive, but my sense is having an MD without the residency is not much better than not having the MD.   Are there options for non-clinical MDs?

I remember seeing mention of a website that catered to MDs that didn't want to practice. I remember it being invite only or something along those lines. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? It's such a vague memory, I may have made it up...

Where I did residency, we tried to use IV metoprolol when possible because it tends to be better in the long run for people with the comorbidities that go along with AF (CAD, CHF, etc...) vs IV dilt gtt.  I have always had this internal bias for metoprolol. Since being out of residency and in my current job, I have not seen an ER physician try metoprolol first, it's always dilt gtt.  I've always assumed it was that they both were pretty equally effective but that a dilt gtt was just more convenient.

I can't find any head to head studies for IV metoprolol vs IV diltiazem to achieve rate control in AF with RVR, but comparing different studies [like this one for IV metoprolol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26830391) which showed ~ 50% response rate (it was better for BB naive patients, which is funny because I was always taught and accepted without questioning that patients who are ""withdrawing"" from BB will respond better) vs [this study with IV diltiazem](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7801862) which showed ~90% response rate.  Note that response is defined a little differently in each study but you get the idea.

Anyways, been thinking about this a bit and decided to jump into the data after seeing a couple AF with RVR's that took longer to control than I would have liked.

Your colleagues over in /r/surgery  would like to chat!

We have been making an effort to change the culture of that sub and have undertaken a better approach to management. So if you didn't like it before- *we didn't either*. Please come give us a new look.

**All medical professionals are welcome** of course. We aren't strictly surgeons, I am an anesthesiologist. You will have my upvote if you tell a good surgeon joke. 

**Surgeons**: you will have everyone else's upvote if you come tell an Anesthesiologist joke. ;-)

**Currently, we would like to hear your argument of the week**: If you have argued about anything regarding surgery or acute care, come post it! (And who *hasn't*?) If you found yourself in an argument about something really really pants-on-head stupid- come post it! 

If you have any surgical subject in mind, come post it! We need content. (Cross post to /medicine also of course for twice the upvotes.)

medicine,What's with the 'ae' in the American spelling of orthopaedics?,"Just a random thought that came to me tonight. Most Americanizations of words that use ""ae"" or ""æ"" change it to just ""e."" Examples include encyclopedia and medieval. The American Academy of Pediatrics exists; the American Academy of Paediatrics does not. (Notably, the same goes for ""oe,"" which leads Americans to say GERD while the Brits call it GORD.)

However, the bone-setters among us are called orthopaedists, they belong to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, etc. 

[The Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopedic_surgery#Nomenclature) says that the spelling of ortho is not uniform. Canada generally doesn't use the ""ae"" (is this true?) while the US and the rest of the Commonwealth generally do. 

[This](https://britishisms.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/ae-spelling/) random blog post posits that the more formal-appearing spelling is a marketing tactic.

medicine,"He is small for an eight-year-old boy, made even smaller by the big trauma room gurney beneath him...","He is small for an eight-year-old boy, made even smaller by the big trauma room gurney beneath him. Two skinny, sunburnt legs stick out from a pair of much too large, frayed, hand-me-down cutoffs. Green grass stains cover the skin of both knees. His bare feet are filthy, farm boy filthy. The kind of filthy that comes from playing in the cool dirt of an old barn floor, from running through uncut fields of wheat alongside the combines, and from climbing the giant hay bales that dot the rolling hills this time of year.

Two hours ago he was just another shirtless boy in a cowboy hat playing in the wheat.

His mother stands across from me. She is perhaps thirty-two. She has sandy blonde hair, just like the boy on the gurney. I can’t see her face because it is buried in her husband’s chest. She is completely silent but her whole body shakes, trembling like an old John Deere combine with something stuck in its blades. Her husband pulls her tight, his arms wrapping around her, trying to protect her from this place, this moment.

The two of them clutch to each other, here, in my emergency room.

At the head of the bed the ventilator chimes and puffs and clicks along as it pushes air into the boy. It pushes air into lungs that collapsed and now have chest tubes draining them. Lungs that cried out just loud enough to stop thirty thousand pounds of combine from turning the boy into chaff with the wheat.

The boy’s arm twitches. The nurse next to me blinks back tears and adjusts his IV.

A case like this is a bomb that detonates in our ER, in our town, in our lives. The shockwaves right now are spreading as neighbors call neighbors, as friends call friends, as family reaches out for family and parents run to check on their children. I know I will not be the only one unable to sleep tonight.

The father stares at his son on the gurney. His face is filled with questions for which I have no answers. How can this happen? How can something we love, something so full of life, be so fragile, so vulnerable, so easily cut down and taken from us in the blink of an eye?

He does not know it yet but he is now standing in a new life. A life that will always be different from the one he woke up to this morning.

I step over to the computer to order some more sedation for the boy while we wait for the helicopter. Taped above the screen is a brand new sign. It is a decal of five gold stars. It seems so out of place at a moment like this. The last few weeks the hospital has been putting them up everywhere. They are there to remind us to give ‘five-star’ service- to tell our patients how much we appreciate their business and hope they will choose us for their future healthcare needs.

They are to be called customers now, not patients, we are told.

Customers.

I tear it off the screen and wrinkle it in my hand into a ball, squeezing it tight. I shove it in the pocket of my white coat.

Twenty-two minutes later the whine of the helicopter engine fills the air as it prepares for takeoff. I stand outside with the father, watching the big blades spin up to speed in the late August light. Inside the helicopter there is room enough for only one parent to go with the boy. One hundred and three miles away a pediatric ICU bed is waiting.

The helicopter lifts off and a cloud of late summer dust fills the air. The father does not move as the debris cloud swirls about his head. Instead, he stares at the window on the side of the helicopter, the dark outline of his son just visible to us both.

We watch the helicopter rise above the pad and rotate slowly. It climbs a little further, hesitates in the air, and then races off above the wheat fields, the grains below bowing from the thrust of its blades.

I take out the five-star decal from my pocket, unfolding it carefully. I tear it in two and press the larger half against the brick wall behind us. I scribble my home phone number on the back.

“Let me know,” I say.

The father takes the paper and nods, still staring at the shrinking outline of the helicopter. At last it disappears over the mountains in the distance. He turns to me but his eyes are empty now. He is already departing, already arriving at the next place. We shake hands and he walks slowly off to his truck. He’s got a long, quiet drive to the city ahead of him.

I look down at what’s left of the ripped up decal in my hand.

The image of the boy burns bright in my mind. I know I will carry this day with me for a very long time.

I make a fist, crumpling the decal.

I respectfully disagree with those who want us to call them customers, healthcare consumers, or business opportunities.

The people we care for are sons and daughters. Mothers and fathers. Husbands and wives. They are neighbors, friends, and sometimes even colleagues.

They are people like you and me in a moment of need.

They are patients.

*Addendum:*

When I wrote this I thought maybe a couple dozen people would want to discuss it. I had no idea it would blow up like this. A couple short points:

1. I really appreciate everyone's comments and insights- from the administrators, to the patients, to others in healthcare. I have learned a great deal just from reading your posts and I hope others have too. Those of you who share your insights and experiences with others are truly the best of reddit.

2. To those determined to find and dox the boy in the story I say this: You are welcome to keep trying but you won't find him. Out of respect for my patients and because of HIPAA I always change enough details of anything I write in a way that makes it impossible to find the individual while staying true to what happened. I will say the original patient who inspired this story several years ago ended up fine.

3. To those of you who asked if I have written anything else I wrote a book of short stories about being an ER doc in a small town. It's here if you are interested. http://goo.gl/7mzn2P

pharmacy,"Does letter writing help under-staffing and fatigued, distracted pharmacists? I dont know, but I've been trying....","Dear FDA

Dispensing errors by pharmacists causing injury and death is a seriously under-addressed issue.

Pharmacies are understaffed like many retail operations with the outcome being very much more severe in terms of harms to customers and many deaths. There has been media coverage of pharmacist dispensing errors in USA today, Forbes, local news, and on and on. So, there is concrete data making it to the news. https://consumer.healthday.com/encyclopedia/drug-center-16/misc-drugs-news-218/avoiding-pharmacy-errors-646512.html

The problem is that there is no oversight of staffing in a pharmacy in the way that there is regulations governing rest periods for truck-drivers by the NTSB or rest intervals for airline pilots regulated by the FAA. Im also a 25 year private pilot....and the FAA has mandated sterile cockpits for airline (and all pilots) pilots during all phases of take-offs and landings. The pilot and first officer may only discuss elements as they relate to their flying duties. The FAA is ahead of the curve....sadly, it appears that the FDA is seemingly unaware of pharmacy distractions leading to errors by pharmacists. Anyone can interrupt a busy pharmacist at anytime...even during our final inspection of a prescription.

So, LASA awareness may help, but were it not for a distracted pharmacist, the LASA errors would not be nearly so numerous. Here is an article from the Institute for Safe Medical Practices, who was cited in the Pharmacy Times article about the FDA's push for safety stating that a rushed pharmacist is a danger. http://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/2300/2015/PharmWorkloadBackRef.pdf

The state boards of pharmacy will not address this issue. Rather, they enforce regulations and cite and fine pharmacists for infractions of state board of pharmacy regulations....and Im suspicious enough to suspect that the California State Board of Pharmacy is heavy handed with citations and fines merely as an avenue to gain revenue. So, the California State Board of Pharmacy has contributed to making the matter of pharmacist dispensing errors worse by instilling fear into us pharmacists over regulation violations, no matter how small. The California State Board of Pharmacy very actively pursues, cites, and fines any pharmacist who is reported to them for making any dispensing error. Do you want someone holding a gun to my head while I pack your parachute for skydiving ? I didn't think so.

The California Board of Pharmacy has gone on record stating that they will not get between a pharmacist and their corporate employer. The California State Board of Pharmacy's position on filling errors caused by under staffing and prescription errors is to issue a statement that the pharmacist should not fill prescriptions any faster than they are comfortable.

Well, the major drug store chains all...ALL...have timers running on the dispensing pharmacist and they all have maximum staffing levels in accordance with their prescription volume. Walgreens pharmacists must explain why they have taken longer than 15 minutes to fill a prescription for a customer who is waiting...never mind that the staffing is inadequate or that Walgreens uses drive-thru windows adding more distraction and even greater demands on their pharmacists. At CVS if a pharmacist is not able to keep up with the 15 minute timer for waiting prescriptions, they can be fired.

It seems to me that the corporate employers merely figure in lawsuits and damages done to harmed patients into their operating budget much like Ford did with its car the Pinto,when a design flaw was uncovered and Ford decided not to fix it as the cost of fixing the design flaw which was resulting in deaths was more expensive than the projected costs of paying off wrongful death lawsuits.

Yet there has not been a law maker who will address board of pharmacy regulations, state law, or federal law to enforce minimum staffing levels in a pharmacy.

The pharmacist associations are not interested as they have an agenda that they are moving forward (the laws giving pharmacists provider status).

It seems to me as a 32 year veteran pharmacist, that the FDA isn't involved in regulating pharmacy staffing levels. I read the article in Pharmacy Times""The FDA issues Guidance to reduce Medication Errors.""  This article was out of touch. LASA issues have been around since 2007 as have been read back of phone-in prescriptions. Even insurance companies can place a hard-halt during the prescription data entry process to warn about LASA drugs. The ISMP is an association that does evaluate pharmacist errors but somehow have not made headway even when they have show that most errors are due to understaffed, over-burdened and distracted pharmacists. They have shown correlation between staffing levels and errors.

We pharmacists in the field need help closing this regulatory gap that allows for understaffed, distracted, and overburdened pharmacists.  As third party reimbursements drop, and corporate pharmacy profit seeking decisions are made, pharmacy staffing is one of very few controllable elements in maintaining profitability. Corporate competition is causing the corporations to accept smaller and smaller reimbursements as they don't want to lose the prescription volume to a competitor.

Patient safety is taking second place to corporate profitability.

We need regulations and legislation to help the cause of understaffed pharmacies...we don't get much sympathy without it as we are highly compensated. If I were to make an error....there is not much sympathy given to the pharmacist for being rushed, distracted, fatigued, hungry, needing a restroom break, or working with an incompetent technician. There is only space given to explain the physical movement of articles thru the dispensing process and the pharmacist must admit that they made an error. Pretty nice for the corporate owner to get a pass in culpability in the error dont you think ?

Do you want me to pack your parachute for skydiving if I am rushed, distracted, fatigued, hungry, need a restroom break, or I'm working with an incompetent technician ???  Yeah, here you go, *NEXT* !

**This is happening now and the errors and the deaths are preventable with minimum staffing and distracted pharmacist legislation that would enforce adequate staffing and reduce or eliminate the ability of anyone to distract a pharmacist while dispensing a prescription.**
 
Please contact me.

Sincerely,
Cinemashow

medicine,Osteopathy in the USA,"I live in Ontario where Osteopathy is considered a CAM. The website for registered osteopaths contains phrases that make me raise an eyebrow, like

Our role is to encourage this self-healing capacity through manual treatment – to convert the physical into the physiological. We allow nature to do its job of removing any and all obstacles and obstructions that will interfere with the proper nutrition and drainage of the body’s tissue. (from:http://osteopathyontario.org/)

training occurs at alternative medicine schools, not at Canadian universities. 

However, in the USA osteopaths can also be M.D.s. Is the founding philosophy of osteopathy sound? Is the training equivalent to that of traditional MDs?

medicine,Today I learnt a lesson on living with a poor prognosis,"I routinely deal with patients who have a limited prognosis (such is the reality of treating cancer), and I routinely give them the same often useless advice: stay positive, make the most of the time you have, something something sunshine and lollipops. The reality is that for many people for whom life expectancy can be measured in a tangible amount of time, lets say under a year, it's not that easy to continue living, and telling them to ""stay positive"", or referring them to a psychologist for advice on how to do that, or prescribing them pills that will dull the anxiety, doesn't neccesarily make it a life worth living.  
One of my patients who I'm treating, who's prognosis is probably a few months unless we get lucky with his treatment, has been feeling a bit better lately with aggressive transfusions, and came in for his appointment today. He told me that for the first time in months he's feeling well, he goes to bed at night tired from a day spent accomplishing something, and for the first time since I've known him, has a fire in his eyes. Why? Because he's *doing* something. He's always been passionate about antique cars, and is now reassembling one that he's had lying around his garage for years. He has a purpose to each day, a goal to accomplish, and something to look forward to.  
Some people can accept dying and not think about it, but I think for many people, especially intelligent people who spent their lives setting goals and accomplishing things, what they need isn't a positive outlook, but a *purpose*, a reason to get up in the morning.
