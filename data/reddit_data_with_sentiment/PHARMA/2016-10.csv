medicine,How does a doctor married to a surgeon make it work? Having a lot of trouble these days.,"Practicing anesthesiologist here - my SO is an orthopedic surgery fellow. We've been together since our third year of residency - met in the OR during a case (a great story for another time). 

We both finished residency last year and entered the next chapter of our lives, moving to a new city to work. I managed to get a job straight out of residency and am working at a different hospital then my SO. He is doing a trauma fellowship at a very busy centre and also trying to complete a grad degree.

It's a very different part of our lives - we were both used to the busy residency life, although the last 2 years have been actually very manageable as our program was pretty nice to senior residents in most specialties - lots of time off to study for our final exams, only on service rotations for me and lots of elective ortho rotations for him which mean that we've been a little spoiled in terms of time together. Even in those awful weeks where we had alternating call shifts and literally didn't see each other for days - we would still be able to at least take a few minutes at the hospital to get a coffee and at least have a minute to be together. Overall, we found a way to make it work in residency and when it didn't we could comfort ourselves with the fact that we were both suffering and it would end soon.

Now...not so much. My life is pretty sweet - I'm usually home by 4 pm, only do call 1-2 times a month and I really love my job. However, his life is pretty tough - he works very long hours and takes a lot of call, as he's got quite a bit of debt from med school and the program he's in puts a lot of pressure on the fellows to take call as much as possible. Even on days when he's not on call, he's coming home at 7- 8 pm, since he'll stay in his office to work on his grad work. As well, while the program is great, he isn't really meeting very many people who he can connect with - my super social boyfriend, who had a million friends back home, now really doesn't have anyone.

It's been really tough - seeing someone I love come home so tired and downtrodden is very hard. I'm also pretty lonely myself - I'm finally done residency and have reached staff life where I have time to have a life...and I'm alone in a city far from all my family and friends and never see my partner.  When I do see him - he'll scarf down a meal and go to bed - some days he's in bed 30 minutes after getting home. I get it - he's working 12+ hour days, but nonetheless it's really hard.

I'm trying to be supportive - for the past couple months I haven't brought up my own loneliness with this situation. I don't want to burden him with anything else on his plate. He does love his job and this is a great opportunity - the centre he's at is a definite possibility for a job prospect following this fellowship! However, at a recent dinner party, I was chatting with some of the wives of other staff surgeons at this centre - and they all said staff life at this big academic place is pretty much the same as fellowship life. That made me literally almost tear up at the dinner - I can't imagine doing this forever. I keep telling myself it's temporary and right now I just need to grin and bear it and be there for him. But I can't do this for the next 20+ years.

I know people do this - I must admit I don't know many surgeon/doctor couples - but couples must survive this. I love this man and don't want to even consider leaving him - but at this point we are distant roommates more than anything else.

pharmacy,What is wrong with United's patient billing department?,"Yesterday my pharmacy lost 15 prescriptions (husband &amp; wife) because Optum returned a rejection that stated ""plan suspended due to non payment of premium"".   I have seen this reject before but usually it was because someone really didn't pay, they're employer terminated their benefits, etc. This time however, I'm fairly certain United fucked something up. You see, the day before, the patient's wife had tried to fill her prescriptions as the dependent on the plan and we received the same reject. They promptly told us this was bullshit, and brought in bank statements to prove it. Upon calling the Rx help desk, they showed the plan as inactive as per United. Anyway, the patient called United, spent a ton of time on the phone with them, and low and behold, it turns out they HAVE BEEN PAYING THIS WHOLE TIME. United fixed the error, sent the correction to Optum and wife got her meds. 

The next day (yesterday) hubby calls up to get his stuff filled and we get the same reject **again**.  Which is ridiculous firstly because he's the plan holder, and secondly because he will be the 10th or so patient I've had this happen to since the end of August. All United plan holders. All but one on a plan which JUST named us as they're preferred pharmacy, so all but 2 have been new patients. 

Anyone else seen this?  Anyone know what's going on? Anyone know if denying coverage on someone that has paid is against any laws? Thanks for reading!

The Task force was created by the [The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity_Information_Sharing_Act). Generally, the act creates the groundwork for private industry to collaborate with the US Federal Government to combat cybersecurity threats. Healthcare cybersecurity was given a special nod in the Act with the formation of a specific task force to examine several questions about cybersecurity threats in the healthcare industry and to write a report for Congress answering those questions. We are about halfway through our process in creating this report, and we would like to query the various communities with an interest in healthcare cybersecurity to see what opinions they have about our specific topics, which include:

* What can the healthcare industry learn from other industries about cybersecurity?
* What are the special challenges that we face with cybersecurity in healthcare?
* What are the difficulties protecting electronic health record (EHR) systems and networked electronic medical devices?
* What cybersecurity study materials should the healthcare industry be exposed to?
* How should an organization designed to coordinate the sharing of cybersecurity threats between healthcare industry players and the US Federal Government operate?

I will be back on this thread tomorrow evening (Tues Oct 4 2016) at around 6 to answer any questions I find on this thread. I will see if I can get some of the other members of the task force to create accounts and answer questions, but no promises. 

Feel free to AMA, but questions about the topics listed above, as well as any healthcare cybersecurity, privacy, interoperability, healthcare information technology, medical device security and/or how they all relate are especially welcome. We decided to post this on /r/medicine rather than [/r/healthit](https://reddit.com/r/healthit) or [/r/cybersecurity](https://reddit.com/r/cybersecurity) specifically because we wanted to get information from providers who may have experienced a cybersecurity event and might have trouble reaching our to policy makers with their thoughts using traditional channels. Feel free to use a throw-away account to comment, but be mindful of the relatively formal nature of this subs rules.

To kick us off, I will post a starter comment discussing some of the concerning trends that we have seen in the last few months. 

Regards,

-FT

UPDATE: Well I have answered every comment here (the only upside of having an unpopular AMA really) so I am signing off now.

medicine,How do you manage patients with type2 diabetes that refuse insulin?,"I'm a fourth year medical student and as the date when I'm managing patients on my draws nearer I've been thinking about situations when the guidelines fall short and how to react in those situations. 

Recently I interviewed a patient that was just diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. During the encounter, she expressed her outright refusal of insulin therapy due to injections. At the time this isn't an issue since she was still naive to medication and I expect that after some thorough counseling she would change her mind if the need for insulin arose, but it got me thinking... What if she never overcame her dislike of injections, even in the face of dialysis or death? Is there a way to escalate oral therapy in these cases? Are there other alternatives that I'm overlooking? After a search of the literature I was only able to find articles that discussed how to broach the subject of insulin therapy to avoid patient refusal, but I couldn't find any treatment strategies when the patient remains adamant. So, aside from waiting on the inhaled insulin device, how do the doctors of /r/medicine manage cases like these?

The ending was sad, it hits way too close to home and it's a very prominent topic among doctors today.

So I've seen medical students using pre-made templates, interns furiously scribbling to-do lists on scraps of paper, residents running lists made on excel, and attendings writing on flash cards. What is your system for keeping track of your patients? 

I am a huge fan of writing things down for each patient. Writing has a lot of utility - flexibility, more information seen at a glance, ability to trend labs, easy to update day by day. But if I have 15 patients on my service, I don't really have time to write down the relevant cc/hpi/pmh/psh/meds/labs and imaging updated on a daily basis/plan/to-dos for each of them. If I want to be a good resident/doctor, these are things I need to know about. I've tried keeping track of patients on an electronic device but it's too inflexible - I don't always have my iPad or computer on me and my phone is too small to be useful.

So what systems have you all developed to keep track of everything? Please pass on your knowledge and experience!",28,40,2016-10-13,PHARMA,0.0279507115483284,0.9397686719894409,0.03228069841861725

It makes me wonder whether the phrase, ""I have a high pain tolerance"" has good positive predictive value for identifying patients who are actually quite hyperalgesic (opioid abusers who have developed opioid-induced hyperalgesia, I'm looking at you). I suppose that folks who are more hypersensitive to nociceptive stimuli -- or those who react to nociceptive stimuli with more emotional distress -- tend to suffer from more pain on a daily basis, and they interpret that daily suffering as having a high pain tolerance.

medicine,Thinking of switching out of surgery,"I'm an intern at a very non-malignant half community/half academic type of general surgery program, and after 3.75 months I feel like I want to change specialties. I really wish I loved surgery and could put up with it, because I have so much respect for the profession, and I've worked my butt off for a decade to get to exactly where I am now - but somehow I'm not finding the OR as fun as I used to, and I really don't enjoy any other aspect of the job. The hours are horrible, seeing consults and running down to the ED are hateful to me, and I can't stand having to communicate with so many people throughout the day. I enjoy the science of medicine and medical decision-making, but I really do not enjoy seeing patients in any setting. I'd prefer to be more introverted, less stressed, and have a job with dependable hours and the possibility of having a great lifestyle and enjoying my interests outside of work. I'm very strongly considering changing specialties at this point to something like radiology or pathology, but I'm having trouble a) once and for all giving up on my longtime dream to become a surgeon, and b) deciding what to do instead; radiology and pathology are so different from each other, yet I can't decide which one would be best.

I'm posting here to solicit advice from anyone who has something constructive to offer. For those who have switched out of surgery - what did you switch to, and was it worth it? How did you do it? Will I regret switching? Do rads and/or path offer quality lifestyles? How to decide on rads vs path? (they're so different, it's frustrating that there isn't a clear choice)

So for the anesthesia part...We're taught we can either inject subcutaneously in a diamond shape, where the wound slit would be in the middle, or we can inject alongside the wound slit. The diamond shape would take 4 injections while the other way would only take 2...

Then there's the discussion on whether to administer the anesthesia WHILE injecting the needle, where some are saying that it numbs the tissue where we are injecting, but that makes no sense, seeing as we need to wait, what, 10 minutes or so before the lidocaine starts working?

On the suture part, we learn that we can either do a 2-1-1 or a 3-2-2 suture. No reason for choosing either? Which should I pick?

medicine,Are there any legit databases with lots of pictures of 'normal' and dysfunctional conditions?,"I'm in medical school and, for a very long time, I've been wanting to find some sorts of websites that have amassed a large number of pictures, IE 20+ or so 'normal' pictures of the ear drum vs 20 of otitis, in varying demographics - 20+ different xrays of a stable fracture of the proximal humerus etc across all age groups/ compared them with 20+ pictures of proximal humerus fractures in patients with osteoporosis

One thing that I really want to do is quickly be able to look through an organized database containig pictures of normal vs abnormal when learning about a condition. So far, I've been pretty disappointed with the relatively small selection of reference material offered by our school. Google imaging them is a bit disorganized and can sometimes be misleading, and therefore time consuming/annoying, and I wanted to know if there is anything reputable, solid, and more streamlined.

I know that nothing beats first hand experience. But, since we live in a media dominated era, I've always wondered if there are multiple organizations out there that take tons of pictures of conditions with documented physical characteristics of the person and have amassed them in databases for learning/reference purposes. Like MRIs, radiographs, pictures, etc with and/or without annotations. Maybe most of them are private and/or expensive to access?

I don't want to get tunnel vision when studying from only 2 or 3 half documented pictures when things may not always look like that in the real world. I've come across examples like this happening to me and it's always made me want better and more reference pictures! 

Free or Paid, if they're out there, I'd LOVE to take advantage of them because I find them incredibly useful and fun!

pharmacy,Pharmacists of Reddit. Please can you tell us which country you practice in and describe a typical day in work? Do you enjoy it?,"I will get the ball rolling. I work in England as an anticoagulation pharmacist. Typically, I run a clinic for half a day. This is usually standard INR monitoring (near patient testing) and dosing of warfarin, acenocoumarol etc. I get about 5 mins per patient in these clinics and see around 35 patients per clinic. I also have another ""new patient"" clinic where I review patients who have been referred to me with AF or new VTE etc and I get them started on treatment. Being a prescriber really helps with this. 

The second half of the day I am usually in the office where I am available to advise other healthcare professionals or patients on anticoagulant treatments. This is usually when I complete new referrals and follow anything up from my clinics. I am on-call usually once a week which usually means I am available to visit patients and administer vitamin k if it is needed (we try our best to keep people out of hospital). 

I don't typically work in community on the medication supply side of things but occasionally do a locum shift to keep my knowledge up and earn some extra cash. 

I really enjoy my job but it can be stressful at times (think a 85-year old lady with an INR of 15 on a Friday night who is point blank refusing admission!).

50s male found down at bottom of concrete staircase for unknown time. Awake but ""disoriented"" per report w finding of abrasion on R temple. Activated as type1 trauma. Overall the activation was straightforward but there was some argument over his GCS. The patient had eyes open and looked around the room somewhat aimlessly. Would not respond to verbal commands and would not speak at all. He basically looked through me when I was assessing him as if he couldn't see me at all. During the exposure portion of our activation the patient worked fairly vigorously to keep himself modest by pulling blankets over himself. He had absolutely zero response to pain. Toe clamping and a sternal rub that nearly took skin were completely ignored and he continued staring and pulling blankets up to cover himself. 

I gave him a 4 for eyes, 1 for verbal, and 6 for motor since his movements were purposeful and spontaneous. There were some that argued for a 5, and a couple votes for a 4 despite his total lack of response to pain. Technically he didn't follow commands but he also didn't localize pain, withdraw from pain, flex, or extend to it... Technically. 

We eventually assumed he was post ictal based on MRI and the scalp abrasion was likely a red herring sustained during a primary seizure event. He started recovering gradually over the night.

pharmacy,DESI Drugs,"I'm hoping some of our more seasoned colleagues can give me a better explanation here.  I (think) I understand the concept for DESI drugs - the drug has been used since Abe Lincoln was president, so their data was grandfathered in, but at some point about six years ago the FDA decided that they shouldn't be allowing drugs to exist that they hadn't verified were effective.  If I'm wrong, please correct me.

My similar understanding was that this is how we ended up with Colcrys and brand name Donnatal instead of the old dirt cheap generics.  Because the manufacturer funded some shitty study that they just had to go through the motions on in order to say they did a study and approve their way-overpriced version of an old drug.

So why am I still getting rejections from insurance companies on DESI drugs?  I get it for things like HC/Pramoxine that there hasn't been a new version developed and they're just coasting on something that's existed for years.  But, for example, there's a new Sodium Sulfacetamide wash in a different concentration seemingly every three weeks.  When Mission or Medimetriks applies to the FDA for approval, do they not actually use any data and just say ""you've approved sodium sulfacetamide/sulfur washes before, we're piggybacking that?""  And why was Donnatal allowed to go back to brand name status if they didn't half ass a study like Colcrys to gain a patent?

I don't know if I'm misunderstanding the FDA approval process or the DESI drug classification, but it's been driving me nuts for a while.",11,13,2016-10-22,PHARMA,0.06049071624875069,0.9160737991333008,0.023435456678271294

-Contraception

-IVF

-Euthanasia  

Most countries allow these conscientious objections and refusals to treat, with varying levels of responsibility for the person.

But looking through the scientific literature, there is very little support for the policy, and many cases where policies have been abused by the extremes of society to influence the care that others receive. 
There are even those who call for it to be reffered to as [“Dishonourable disobedience”](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213560X14000034)

If anyone has any specific cases when they were aware of a conscientious objection occurring, that would be fascinating as well.

The AMA Code of Ethics specifically refers to this in clause 3.d:

medicine,"I'm an intern who had an idea for a medical device, but don't know how I would even begin to go forward with anything about it.","Hey all,

I'm a new intern and had an idea for a new type of imaging device. It would be useful for frequent ambiguous presentations to the ED (think abdominal pain and chest pain) and could be theoretically used to predict surgical outcomes as well. 

I have had a lot of fun turning the idea over in my head and am about 50% sure it would work and/or be clinically useful. The problem is, this is something that would require a ton of R&amp;D, time and money which I have none of, let alone the electrical, hardware, or software expertise to develop something like this. 

Now my question is would it ever be possible for an intern like me with no advanced engineering or business knowledge to ever bring something like this to reality? 

I know the chance of me being able to bring anything like this to life is essentially within rounding error of being zero, but I think that if something as complex as MRI could be made a reality that there has to be some path to develop things like this. Anybody have of these types of ideas before or any experience that could give any advice about how you would start working on a very ambitious project like this?

pharmacy,How to elicit change in the pharmacy profession?,"Hello everyone. I am a last year pharmacy student, almost graduating as a pharmacist. This is from an Ontario perspective. However, I want to initiate a movement that will allow change in the pharmacy profession across North America.

Pharmacists AND pharmacy students are CLEARLY being taken advantage of by corporations and their managers. 

Once pharmacy students graduate, they also perpetuate the cycle as it is easier on pharmacists to have free labour available. These are due to the laws enacted that exempt pharmacists &amp; students from basic necessities of a working person (ex.no minimum wage, breaks, over-time, no limits on hours of work, public holidays, vacation pay etc). The work that pharmacists do, now with metrics, increasing workload and decreased staffing increasingly shows that pharmacists should be afforded these basic necessities. 

The main issue I have with this is that corporations abuse these exemption rules, squeezing whatever work they can get out of pharmacists, for their profit and shareholders. I honestly find it disgusting. Not only does it eventually cause a pharmacist to burn-out but leads to increased dispensing errors and sub-optimal care. We are not treated as respected professionals, nor are we treated fairly for the amount of revenue we bring in for these companies. Without pharmacists, they would not be able to operate.

So /r/pharmacy, what does it take to elicit change? Do I bring this up to a news corporation, write articles, give the public awareness of this issue (unreasonable wait times seems to suggest unawareness)?",21,16,2016-10-25,PHARMA,0.11118079721927643,0.8643032312393188,0.024516010656952858

medicine,Questions about Peds/Psych/Child psych triple board residency,"Hey all,
I'm currently just a lowly MS 2 interested in the triple boarded program Peds/Psych/Child psych.

I am over 30 and some of the careers I liked before getting into medicine were like politics and being a life coach, so I think psych would be a great fit for me. However, I very much like medicine and would hate to never use medicine again in my career. Also, I really like kids and think being a pediatrician would be great, but is not specialized enough for me to make the money I need for my requisite lifestyle, paying back loans, taking care of disabled family members, etc.

I think child psych would provide the lifestyle and compensation, and I would love to do Peds clinic once/week or moonlight as a hospitalist.

It sounds pretty great, in theory, right?

So here are questions:
1. Is this plan realistic? How many people who are double/triple boarded actually use all their certs?
2. For practicing physicians, does this plan sound realistic or like pie-in-the-sky ambitions of an ms2?
3. Do you think the dual/trio of training will make me more valuable in the market? Will this drastically increase my salary and advancement opportunities?
4. I would like to be a practicing clinician and maximize my income while also practicing a specialty I love. If I like peds and psych, is this the best way to do it, or do you know of another way?
5. Do you know any peds vs child psychs, and who is more happy and for what reason?

Late 40's female pt presenting from home via ems for altered mental and kussmaul respirations, ems cbg 390. Family states she took too much metformin (unsure of how much of an OD, appears to be accidental). Seen two days ago at urgi care for nausea and sent home with PO zofran.

Upon arrival pt having obvious kussmaul respirations, end tidal co2 7-9, pupils 4 and nonreactive. O2 100% on 4L nasal cannula. BP normotensive. Patient has GCS 13 (pupils open to speech and confused, normal muscle movement). Pt follows commands and equal strength in all extremities. Pt able to maintain airway. Rectal temp showing 87F. EKG showed Sinus rhythm with low voltage QRS.

Labs show: VBG - pO2 of 292 (redrawn 3 times in 3 separate sites to ensure it was a venous stick) VBG - PCO2 - 15-20 VBG pH - &lt; 6.7 (machine doesn't read lower than that)

osmolality - 300 WBC - 32k K - 7.4 Creat - 9 BUN - relatively normal (cannot remember exact number)

Treatment included a total of 5L of warm NaCl, bear hugger, temp foley, 10 units IV regular insulin and an insulin drip, broad spectrum antibiotics. After 5L of fluid patient only produced 30mL of urine in a 3 hour period. Urine showed high amount of blood and bacteria and moderate ketones, no WBC in urine. 

After several (4?) hours of warm fluids and a bear hugger, pt's temperature only went from 87F to 90F. 

I am absolutely stumped and this will haunt me until I have a better guess as to why her labs were crazy in this direction. Currently pt is in ICU where she has coded once but was successfully revived. 

My only guess is that given her confusion with nonreactive pupils and labs maybe she did have an atrial or septal defect and adequate oxygenated blood was not getting to her brain?

We (3 ER doctors, multiple RNs and techs) can not figure out why her venous gas showed that high of an O2. Respiratory refused to believe it was venous despite the three draws. Only thing we could think of is atrial or ventral / septal defect?

medicine,Post-residency discussion: The ICU and floor Nurses and malignant relationships with MDs,"So now that I'm a few months past being signed and having a normal life, I figured it would be nice to post this discussion with hindsight being 20/20.  I work in an open ICU and take care of patients on both the floor and the critically ill as a normal day on my hospitalist service.  It's fun for the most part, and interactions with staff at my institution are thankfully pleasant.  It calls back to mind, though, a time in life when those interactions were not pleasant.  Residency.  Specifically with nursing.



Please don't slaughter me; I know theres a lot of RN/NP/LPN readers on the sub.  I love you guys.  I truly do.  I just wanted to discuss the relationships between doctors and nursing from a doctor's perspective.   I don't see a lot of MD's doing this (though can barely open facebook or reddit without seeing the opposite).  Just wanted to add my two cents.  The things I say apply to both ICU and floor nurses.



When I think back to residency, some of the most frustrating experiences I had weren't with my co-physicians or admins, but rather with nurses.   Through my experience practicing med (6 years total which still is NOTHING in the scheme of things) I've seen this to be a common threat.  This sort of behavior applies to interactions with attendings as well, mind you, but that's much more behind-the-back and for times sake we will focus on residents.



I guess to start the discussion, I'd like to make a statement.  The interactions between nursing and residents, while often good, often has underlying adversarial tones with certain subsets of people in the profession (both doctors and nurses).  I do not know where some young RNs (and not to overgeneralize, but the 22-30 year old crowd is the most guilty in my experience) get the idea that they know more than doctors, especially in the Intensive Care Unit.  Even at the place I work now (teaching facility) it's still mind-blowing hearing some of the comments made on a regular basis from the nursing team about the resident team.  It's not just going for blood; it's more aquin to going for the jugular and trying to rip it out.  Remarks along the lines of ""I stop baby doctors from killing people"" is absolutely, positively astounding to hear from a 25 year old RN.  Astounding.




The ICU mentality is even worse, and I am understadning of the reasons why nurses feel that way.  I feel, though, that at teaching institutions the sort of behavior I observe from a small amount of nurses is completely reprehensible and it is only getting worse.  I do not know how this sort of idea that they know more than an entry-level resident on the case came about, and even though they may have a better sense when a patient may need pressors off a whim than the intern on service, it is absolutely no grounds for disrespect.  Furthermore, that disrespect sows the seeds of bad relationships...which is kind of the antithesis of actual success in medicine and learning.  We're all here to learn.  That would be like the accountant pointing out something on the CEOs tax returns and screaming that ""HA I KNOW BETTER.""  It's all a matter of perspective.  That aforementioned nurse may know the pressors really good, but that second year junior resident is there to learn the pathophysiology, everything that can go wrong, how to find it, how to fix it, and how to humanistically tell the family (amongst other things).  It's all a matter of perspective and its disgusting that EITHER side gets egos involved.




I'll never forget a story from my final year of residency when the resident on the other team was attempting to get a radial art line but failed and needed to go for a femoral approach.  Pt. was phenomenally unstabile and his intern had royally fucked the radial to angiospasm 10 times over and we really needed invasive monitoring.  No fem kits available in this unit (in a tertiary referral center WTF but thats another story) so my colleage decied to use the largest radial available and successfully got a wave form and pressure on the monitor.  We were able to ascertain his pressure for real, get him on the right meds due to this, and stabilize a hypotensive man with a scary as fuck looking junctional tachyarrhythmia.

  This 23 year old nurse went around after seeing he used a radial on the fem and called him the ""dumbest fucking doctor she ever saw"" to every nurse and nursing student who would listen.  Most brushed it off, but rumors find a way of being fuck all stupid.  The line blew later the next day when they proned the patient for ARDS and this particular specimen of a nurse of course attributed it to my friend.  She finally was disciplined.  Like I said, just an example.  But I think all of us in the profession as a whole have seen the trend that some nurses have taken this attiitde.



On the bright side...there are SO MANY FUCKING AMAZING NURSES OUT THERE and DOCTORS DONT THANK THEM ENOUGH.  We should.  We have no excuses.  I honestly believe so much of the good has come out of the bad ones setting such a bad example that they know they must avoid.  I swear to God on my life a good nurse has saved my ass so many more times than I can count.  Because of stuff like that I can't for the life of me understand why these up and comers and yunguns can't strive to be more like the leaders in their field as opposed to these new ""know it all"" Nurse Jackie wannabees.



TL;DR: I love nurses.  I just can't believe the attitude some of the younger ones have and how badly they treat residents while acting like they know everything.  It sucks how social media reinforces it.  It sucks and makes doctors look like the incompetent bad guys if these idiots get a louder voice.",213,287,2016-10-27,PHARMA,0.09021539986133575,0.8821794986724854,0.027605132199823856

medicine,I feel dirty,"I'm looking for advice. 

I'm on ICU right now. Loving it so far. Might end up doing it, actually. But this one patient...she's an obese old lady on a vent. Got the roc, got the sedation on board. She's not going to make it. My attending knows, my seniors know, nurses know. But she's full code.

So everyday, we're thinking, ""this might be the day."" But those words FULL CODE are haunting the team and everyone on that floor. 

I was there when the attending started to prepare the son to have ""the talk."" He wasn't ready. First time he was seeing his mom hooked up to the machines, the lines, the tubes. Attending was very nice, very gentle. Let him have his time.

Next day, she's getting worse. Attending tells me to call the son and ask him about DNR status. So I do. He's still not ready. But more than that, he's not understanding what DNR is, and I can tell. 

So I'm trying to tell him...keeping it simple, letting him know it's not the same as stopping treatments, letting him know we would be doing the exact same things we're doing now. I'm being clear. I'm good at this. I've always been good at this. I was raised by an uneducated immigrant senior citizen...I have been breaking complex messages into their simplest most comprehensible forms since I was a kid. I don't use jargon unless I intend to define it. But at the same time, I'm holding back, because I know this is his mother. Because I know this is the hardest thing he's ever had to do in his life. 

So my message gets softened, maybe a little too much. I want to tell him CPR is violent, bloody, and that people that have as much wrong with them as she has end up not living anyway. But I don't make it that explicit. It's his mom. I try to tell him we don't want to end up hurting her without doing any good, but I can tell I've lost him. He is vaguely aware about the differences between DNR and comfort care, but he is no closer to making a decision.

Another day passes. She continues to decline. The fellow this time tells me after rounds to call the son again. Let him know. So I do. I end up reiterating some of the points from the night before. I motivate myself by reminding myself that I don't want to torture this lady while she's on her way out. It's going to be me doing the compressions. I've done them before, several times. I tell myself, it's not that I know she won't make it, it's that if she does she'll be even worse off than now. But she probably wouldn't make it. I try to translate this to the son.

The conversation is a calm one. Both of us are calm. Voices aren't being raised. He isn't crying. Upset to what you would expect from a person in his position, but not moreso. 

Then I hear a voice in the background. Someone asking him a question. He responds, ""He's trying to convince me to kill my mom,"" to which the first voice replies with an incredulous, ""What?""

My eyes widen and my heart drops to the floor. 

With that, I know I've lost him, and I also feel like I've lost myself. I already felt dirty from the first conversation. Now even moreso. It's possible I could have hallucinated this. Maybe I didn't hear it correctly and my mind replaced what it couldn't discern with an interpretation of garbled words filtered through my pre-existing guilt. But I probably did hear it correctly.

I immediately drop the conversation. I just agree with everything he says, clarify that she will not be DNR, and tell him I'll see him when he comes in. Takes about 30 seconds. An eject button.

Aside from the issue of humanity and wondering what just happened to mine, the sting of failure is also felt. Like I said, I pride myself on my communication skills. It doesn't mean people always agree with me, or that I'm a master persuader. I'm not. It just means that people understand what I'm saying, and just as importantly, I understand what they are saying. If there are misunderstandings, I try to understand those gaps as well. 

I fuck up sometimes too. If I'm not focused enough, I'll let jargon slip. Or I might not wait long enough for a question to come when I can feel one is coming with just a few more seconds of pause. But when I'm *trying*, this  sort of thing shouldn't happen. I shouldn't fail at explaining something when I'm trying.

I want to tell him I don't want his mom to die, that I'm trying my best to save her along with everybody else. But I know I shouldn't talk to him anymore. I already told the fellow I'm not going to. Owning up to failure is a part of this process. I can do that. But I still feel dirty.",37,157,2016-10-28,PHARMA,0.14473657310009003,0.8271554112434387,0.0281080175191164

 Currently, care and outcomes are poor unless our clients are able to travel for medical care.  We consistently find doctors ignoring referrals or sending back letters that the doctor won't take the patient's case.   

 I decided to ask local hospitals and practices directly what is going on.  I just heard back from yet another major hospital that they won't see anyone if they have an Ehlers Danlos diagnosis in their chart.  It wasn't clear if this was an official hospital policy or if it just happened that not a single department would see EDS patients.  

I get that EDS can be a difficult diagnosis to treat.  Many EDS patients are complex and need more time and resources to treat effectively.  But barring all EDS patients from a hospital or practice seems an extreme stance.   

  I'm trying to understand why this is happening and what I as an advocate can do about it.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated, but I do have a few specific questions.    

Is this a common thing that happens with certain diagnoses?   If not, why is EDS so shunned? If it is common, what about a condition makes it likely to be blacklisted like this (ex. reimbursement, difficulty of population, outcomes from treatment, how well known it is, etc.?)  

What can patients and advocates do to get this blacklist overturned, or dealt with reasonably?     

 Am I even going in the right direction by talking to individual doctors, departments, and hospitals?   Should I be targeting education institutions, insurance companies, or policy makers instead?
