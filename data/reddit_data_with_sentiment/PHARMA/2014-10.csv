pharmacy,How do thiazides work after diuresis?,"Dear r/pharmacy, I am a p4 student on rotation in am care and trying to figure this out but neither I nor the other two students on rotation can find an answer. 

I know that thiazides reduce bp by lowering total body sodium which decreases blood volume and then blood pressure, but then compensatory mechanisms kick in and reverse their effect (raas, sns, etc). How else do thiazides exert their antihypertensive effects?

pharmacy,What options do I have? Walgreen's wont' fill my prescription and no one else has it in stock,"Pharmacists- any guidance would be appreciated.  I am trying to fill my monthly Adderall prescription in the Orlando FL area.  I have been taking this medication for a long time from the same doctor.  My main pharmacy (Target) is out of stock - claiming a manufacturer shortage/backorder.  Same story at Walmart, two local CVS, and two mom and pop shops I tried in my area.  

I went to a Walgreen's, which I've been to once before in the last 3 months that was able to fill it, and they told me they have it in stock but I'd need to come pick it up the next day, but only if my ""analysis"" looked ok.  After a few minutes, the gentleman said it looked fine but I still had to wait until the following day.  When I came back the next day, a different, young, pharmacist told me that Walgreen's will no longer fill this prescription for me and handed me back my script.

The more pharmacies I go to, the more I end up looking like ""drug seeking"" behavior, as I get farther and farther away from my home address and have never filled with theses pharmacies before.  I am really upset about this.  I am not abusing my medication, I am not selling it to anyone else, I simply want to maintain my medication so I can function.

Do I have any ability to appeal at Walgreens?  Is it true that I've been blacklisted there now for this medicine?  I can't find this anywhere and I'm at wits end spending time on a wild goose chase just trying to get my refill like normal.

What do I do???

medicine,I am terrible at presenting patients.,"I have never been great at hospital medicine. My first rotation as a 3rd year I could barely present a patient or write a progress note. I have improved in a sense but I should be better by now (I am not stating my current status on purpose). I know the correct order of things eg. patient name, age, gender, cc, hpi, pmh..... etc. Additionally, I am almost never succinct which frustrates attendings. Also, I am not the best in the world. I sometimes miss asking important questions accidentally. I have to embarrassingly say ""I don't know"" too many times (which also adds to the frustration). 

Also, importantly, I am not great at presenting (even lectures) without reading off a well written script. When I study I take my time. Often this means I stay in a lot to make sure I get through all my work. Unfortunately, we are given only a brief amount of time to study up on new patients in the morning before we present. 

What can I do to improve?

tl;dr I do not present well. I do not need to be reminded of the correct order information should be presented in. I often miss important questions during my interview, I am not succinct, and I take too much time in trying to memorize information about my patients.

pharmacy,Problems with generic Cymbalta?,"I've been on Cymbalta for several years for anxiety/panic disorder. It's worked great all along, and I've done very well on it. 

Then this year happened. Backsliding horribly, really struggling. My dr upped my prescription from 60 mg/day to 90 mg/day. I seemed to do better, but not as well as I was used to. 

I started going downhill again recently. Then I realized that the trouble started about the same time as I switched over to the generic. Did a google search, and apparently quite a few people are having problems with it, not just for depression &amp; anxiety, but also people taking it for pain. There were posts not only from patients, but also from doctors.

I'm going to talk to my dr tomorrow about it, and see if we can try the brand-name again. But I was wondering if anyone on here was seeing patients having issues with the generic and having to go back on brand-name Cymbalta. It's sad, because I've used other generics and never had a problem, and was looking forward to this one going generic.

If it helps, my generic is labeled Torrent. Are there other generic brands of it that might work better? Thanks for any help. I'll ask my pharmacist about it, but I figured this is a good place to get feedback from more pharmacists, too.

I worked my way up from Teller all the way to Branch Manager and the last couple of years I worked as a Mortgage Consultant. But after 9 years in the banking field, I am no longer enjoying my job and not looking forward to work each day.

So the last couple of months, I've been thinking a lot about going back to school (either Business School or Pharmacy School). I have not done a lot of research about what is needed or how I am going to pursue this at age 33. I want to get some advise or info from you guys/gals on how I should proceed with this.

pharmacy,RXM keeps making errors and leaving me to clean up the mess,"I used to have a high opinion of my RXM but as time goes on I'm starting to see him as an overgrown child. He acts like any question he is asked by a customer is the most inconvenient thing that could happen to him and I'm surprised he hasn't brought in more complaints about the way he treats people. If he's in a bad mood the tension in the air is palpable. Him acting like a jackass I could ignore, but any issue he could actually manage (you know, being the manager and all) usually falls to me if it happens during our overlap period. 

An example is the time he pretended to be on the phone taking a prescription from a nurse when he was just listening to the voicemail over and over - he even was saying ""mhmm"" and pretending to clarify when I could hear the end of message menu clearly playing. While he was pretending to be busy, I got to deal with an extremely irate patient whose prescription he'd misfilled for several months running. And yes, for each fill he had been the one doing the pre-verification and final product review. In a nearly identical instance I asked him to step in and he stated straight at the computer and refused to make eye contact with me. He wouldn't move from the computer and I took the shit again for his fuckup. 

This week I caught another error of his (an e-RX entered for TID dosing for a med that should've been dosed once qPM - his initials were on every step). I spoke with the doctor and made a half-hearted attempt to call the patient, but I'm glad she didn't answer because I don't want to have to explain again that we (read:the RXM) made an error. My ass-kissing boots are getting worn out. 

Should I address my concerns with the RXM? He's so defensive and childish that I think it would only make things worse for me. I suppose I could go to the store manager or district manager but I don't know if that would go anywhere or be worth the potential backlash because I'm sure I'd end up getting written up for something trivial as retaliation. 

I mean seriously, I've seen this guy just click through pre-verification without reading the screen and then click accept on final product review without opening the bottle more often than not. He's so negligent that our intern has brought concerns to me about it before. 

So do I just let it ride and remain secure in knowing that I'm doing the most basic part of my job as a pharmacist correctly (and thus shoveling the RXM's shit every time he doesn't) or do I speak up and deal with the potential fallout? I understand that patient safety should be the highest priority but corporate politics might make my life very difficult if I take that route.

I've been trying to figure out what exactly I want to do and how to go about doing it. 

I have a strong interest in doing plant genetics/agricultural biotechnology (crop research/GM foods etc) but at my university no one is in that field (i'm on the east coast)- they all do human genetics. Because of that my major program also focuses on human genetics. I was advised to look into internships and co-ops more within my desired area otherwise it might be very hard for me to continue on/be accepted into a grad program as I will have very little plant experience. 

So I guess I'm asking- 

How did you find the opportunities? Both educational (master's programs) and job (I don't even know what companies to look at other than Dupont and Montasanto) 

What made you decide to go into the area?

pharmacy,Just wanted to say thanks :),"I just read the article titled, ""The Simple Truth of Retail Pharmacy."" I never realized how stressful being a pharmacist can be (disclaimer: I am a patient). I just wanted to say ""thank you"" to all of the pharmacists and techs here.

I have a fantastic pharmacist at the independently-owned pharmacy I go to. I've been going there since early 2012, and the two regular pharmacists are extremely professional and knowledgeable.

One of the regular pharmacists is the owner, and he has bent over backwards to help me out several times. It's nice being able to walk in and all of the staff know my name. The owner actually knows what medications I'm on off the top of his head!

The pharmacy is quite busy because it is one of only two pharmacies in my city of 115,000 people that dispenses methadone for MMT (especially on Monday and Tuesday mornings, which is when most MMT patients leave their urine samples at the clinic and then have their weekly prescription faxed to the pharmacy), but the pharmacists will ALWAYS make time to answer any medication questions.

It amazes me how much work I see him do (and I know he does a lot more that I don't see) and that he still provides excellent customer service.

I know from reading this subreddit that pharmacy is not an easy field, and it saddens me that pharmacists (and techs) don't get more respect. I know many of you are like my pharmacist, and I just wanted to take a minute to thank you all for what you do.

The book is very old and a good chunk of pages are coming out. I thought medical professionals here might like a look at the book so I took a few pictures which can be found here.

There are some neat illustrations and cutaways randomly throughout. The table of contents has some...interesting topics. If there is enough interest, I might take some requests for pics on various sections.

medicine,Wife is PA; uses eClinicalWorks; asked me to help her find a new tablet or laptop; what are your experiences and recommendations?,"Howdy--
My wife is a PA, and her office uses eClinicalWorks. Her laptop is 9 years old, and they have asked her to present them with a purchase recommendation (they're a small clinic). Because I'm the tech guy in the family, she asked me to check into it--and I figured that I'd ping Reddit (...and of course there is a Medicine subreddit).

She currently uses an old laptop/tablet that has a rotating screen that folds down and creates a ""notepad"" (I think it's a Fujitsu). It also has a ""pen"" (stylus) that she likes more than the mouse. Her current machine takes 30 seconds to open a new window. It's just done.

She doesn't actually use the ""tablet"" for writing or data entry while working with her patients. She does all of her charting either at her station or at home. They have Dragon installed, which is how she does 95% of her data entry ""typing"".

I was looking at the new Windows Surface Pro tablets, which seem pretty cool. They would have a stylus, are quad core, light and have the docking station--plus they run Windows 8 (8.1). Given that her clinic is cheap (as you can tell by the fact that they have her on a 9 year old laptop), in reality they likely won't spring for a Surface Pro 3. So I was looking at the Surface Pro 2, which seem like they might work (they're cheap, too--around $400 at Best Buy).

If you are a PA/doc/other that uses eClinicalWorks, what are you using for your laptop or tablet setup? How is it working, and if you had a (budget) magic wand, what would you recommend we ask for?

Thanks for your help. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to fire them off.

Thanks!

medicine,"Help! Another service stole my paper! (No but seriously, advice please)","Basics of the story are this:

- A patient came in to my department's clinic (I am a resident), and complained of symptoms that later turned out to be secondary to a systemic issue (aggressive cancer)

- We pursued a diagnosis, recognizing this was likely a larger issue given the patient's other symptoms.

- All other services (heme/onc, neurology, etc) essentially gave up on diagnosis after basic testing and imaging yield nothing diagnostic.

- Other services declined biopsy.

- I spent a lot of time with neuroradiology, and others, trying to find something to biopsy. Found it, and my service biopsied it.

- Pathology NOT amenable to special stains, finally do it, and biopsy is positive, we send the patient to get treatment, and pt is now the longest living survivor of his subtype.

- I present this at national conferences, repeatedly speaking to different departments about collaboration between Neurology, Heme/Onc, Pathology, and ourselves as I am writing this up. Never got any help. Never get a slide from path to present at any meeting despite calling the chair (both ourselves and attending).

- I find out that one of these departments has written this up on their own, knowing full well that I was in the middle of writing this up, and refusing to let us know until it has been accepted to a MAJOR journal.

- I let my chair know, basically tells me to submit as a review paper instead; not interested in any politics.

So, to my knowlege my options are basically to talk to the department myself (I am a chief resident, they were rude to my attending), or just rewrite as a review. I am not happy with either of these, as I feel it is unjust. Are there any other options out there for me?

UPDATE:
I finally got in touch with the attending on the case, said that basically we can add a figure to their paper to add one and only one author, and that we do NOT get rights to see the manuscript before it gets published to see the scope of clinical information used, as well as the focus of the paper. They say that they took ""all information available from the chart"" which is 90% my service, so they will use our clinical information as well.

medicine,Doctors: advice for difficult patients?,"I'm noticing that healthcare practitioners quickly become very sensitive about the types of patients that they want to treat. They seem to want patients who will be happy with their service, which is understandable but impractical. Here's the types of patients that don't fit this mold:

- **Difficult to diagnose**. People who have problems that require a lot of testing of specialized expertise. Lots of problems and unclear which are side effects.
- **Grumpy patients**. This especially hits those who are chronically sick, elderly for example. They've bounced around lots of doctors and are used to being rejected.
- **High standards**. Some patients simply want 5 opinions before making big decisions.
- **Selfish patients**. They're inconsiderate and demanding. Most likely to argue about bills.
- **Ignorant patients**. They simply don't know how to be a patient. They don't understand insurance or visits or anything about healthcare. I'd lump hypochondriacs into this category.
- **Non-compliant patients**. Life is busy and difficult. Some find it hard to follow orders.
- **Mental disorders**. People who are depressed, anxious, etc These conditions are often side effects of conditions they're trying to get treatment for.
- **Abusers**. They go to the ER for everything. They're not difficult to treat but their lack of ethics seems to be a big impediment for physicians.

Feel free to add any categories that I've missed. I broke them down by category so you can provide different advice to different types of patients. What advice do you have for these patients?",35.0,8,2014-10-31,PHARMA,0.12739795446395874,0.8511658310890198,0.02143619954586029
