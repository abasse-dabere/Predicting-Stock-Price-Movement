medicine,How can we make life easier for each other?,"I'll start.  From a surgery perspective:

\- if your consult involves even a remote possibility of surgery, please make the patient NPO when you decide to call us

\- if you are asking us to rule out appendicitis or cholecystitis, unless you have some other reason to do so, don't start the patient on antibiotics empirically. If their pain goes away, now we don't know if it's because of the antibiotics or if it's because they don't have appendicitis or cholecystitis. 

\- if you're going to consult based on an imaging finding, please have looked at the images yourself rather than just the report and examined the relevant body part. 

\- if a patient has a surgical history, please know what it is, especially if it's easily found in the EMR (i.e. an open appendectomy, or a colectomy for diverticulitis, rather than ""they have a history of abdominal surgery"")

\- if a patient has a truly incarcerated hernia, feel free to call us before you get a CT scan.

\- please really think about whether a consult for a minor issue needs to be called in the middle of the night, even if the patient is being admitted to you from the ER.  Most things can wait until the morning. Yes, even abscesses.  You don't need surgery on board/to sign off before you admit if the patient is being admitted anyway for other reasons.

\- please don't consult for outpatient issues simply because they're in the hospital, or because the patient demands it.

Maybe if they didn't waste money sending print to people who don't want them, they wouldn't have to require paywalls for their websites.

I’m so excited to start learning.

In Nov. 2018, I first asked my secretary to call her to schedule an appointment to discuss results from her blood test in Oct. 2018. Without breaching her privacy,  suffice to say that there's nothing alarming, but some results are unhealthy like a tad high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol.

Yet after at least 7 tries on the telephone by my secretary, she either postpones the appointment, or schedules but then cancels, alleging that she's busy. Whenever I see her at the library, I tenderly remind her, but she doesn't act. 

Thus what reasons may explain her procrastination and  non-compliance? Thanks!

Resident Connect - [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/resident-connect/id1367311896?mt=8) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wckethman.rc) \- Select: Demo University - passcode: demo

Key features:

\- Search directory for quick access to hospital numbers

\- Toggle favorite numbers for easier access to those most commonly used

\- Ability to set default hospital in the Settings menu (great for when rotating through multiple hospitals)

\- Hide your callback number by default when calling from your personal phone

\- Suggest and flag (for edit or deletion) numbers in real-time

\- Available for iOS and Android

**Please don't hesitate to reach out if you are willing to sponsor your institution and spearhead efforts to make this available.**

Edit: Forgot to mention as long as you commit to entering numbers, it is free, just requires the upfront effort to organize the directory for your program.

pharmacy,What it's Like to be #1 at Three Letter [rant],"I'm a tech from the top three letter pharmacy of a specific district/region and I wanted to make a post for all of you pharmacists who struggle to score high on corporate's ""report cards."" I've been with the company for over 2 years now and we've been #1 the entire time I've been there, which I always thought was a nice thing to humbly brag about. After all, that's pretty cool, right?!

&amp;#x200B;

So, here's why all of YOU should continue to strive to be the best!

1) You will become OBSESSED with maintaining your score that means \*so much\*

2) You will become STRESSED when your scores go down, even if only by a \*couple\* percent. Even if you're still number 1

3) You will expect your techs to care just as much as you do about maintaining your score, even though they receive literally ZERO benefit from it (no pay raises, etc.)

4) You will receive NO extra help. This means NO special treatment from corporate higher ups for doing your job well. Not implying that it would be fair, but this usually applies to teacher's pets. If anything, they will be more strict with you about the smallest of rules.

and finally, 5) Corporate will BREAK you. The reason you're number 1 to them? It's because you have too much help! Not because you and your techs worked your asses off to be the best. Nothing says ""Good Job!"" like cutting 30 weekly tech hours and watching your store fall apart.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

We are a small/medium volume store, but 30 tech hours is a LOT. We already only had 1-2 techs at any given time (and no tech the hour before closing). Now we don't even have enough hours to have ONE tech at all times. Now, the queue is never completed, closing duties don't get done daily, all expireds were pulled on the LAST day of the month, etc. Seriously, you'd think we do 800 scripts a day with the way our pharmacy looks currently, and it's only been two weeks of this. My pharmacy manager is good boss, but she doesn't manage her stress well and is now blaming her techs for everything being a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone looking to become a pharmacist, I'm getting the hell out of here ASAP. I refuse to work at a place that will punish you for doing your job well. Who will put you under constant daily stress just so they can save a few bucks.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; being good at your job at three letter means you get less help, less hours, and exponentially more stress. You're seriously better off maintaining an average score",48,85,2019-01-04,PHARMA,0.08300532400608063,0.8795394897460938,0.037455201148986816
medicine,I wasn't credited as an author on the research project I started but didn't finish.,"I was flipping through the latest issue of a journal recently and found my research written up without my name on it.  I did a poster project for the the big annual international conference when I was a fellow in 2014, and handed the project off just before I left the institution.  Figure 1 is definitely mine, and Figures 2 and 3 probably are (I'm not exactly certain).  The first author added some more work and wrote the manuscript, definitely, but they did not expand the original case series (2010-2014) which I collected, or change the original analysis I reported.

Now, I fully admit, the first author did &gt;50% of the work, and got the project over the goal line, etc.  And really, I'm in private practice with no intention to ever return to the academy, so it's not a *huge* deal to me, but I figure I did enough to be second author.

Is there anything I can or even should do at this point?  Did they do something actually wrong/illicit/unethical or just impolite?  If I contact the journal and/or university with proof of my involvement (say, original images/powerpoint slides/abstract/spreadsheets of analysis, I've got it all still), will something come of it?  Should I even bother?  I'm not looking to get anyone in trouble, but I am slightly miffed.

I was wondering if any of you know regularly use a reliable website/blog/journal, that summarizes recent, important cardiological clinical trials/reviews/meta-analyses (Similarily to the way uptodate with their ""What's new in cardiovascular medicine"" feature, but more in depth.) I have used medscape thus far and am totally convinced.

Any help would be appreciated! Best wishes,

I've been doing this for over 20 years and none of you, in the US, Mexico, Ireland, UK, France, Germany, Turkey, or anywhere else has ever failed to give me good and effective advice.

medicine,"Pennsylvania Supreme Court attempting to change venue rules to allow malpractice claims from any part of the state to be tried in any other county. Namely, plaintiff-friendly Philadelphia. What do you all think?","http://www.pacourts.us/assets/uploads/Resources/Documents/Proposed%20Amendments%20of%20PaRCP%20Nos%201006%202130%202156%20and%202179%20-%20007481.pdf?cb=64836

I see this as nothing but a handout for trial lawyers, in plaintiff-friendly Philadelphia.  Many verdicts in the tens of millions, or hundreds of millions, of dollars, come from this area where a bad outcome is often equated to malpractice and there are no caps on ""non-economic damages.""  I see this is the judicial system revising legislation, signed years ago, when Pennsylvania had a malpractice crisis in the early 2000s.  Activism at its worst.

We're going to be treated in vivo worse than common criminals, who usually are tried in the county in which the alleged crime was committed.  An Erie county physician should contend with a jury of their peers, not those in Philadelphia county, which is notoriously plaintiff-focused.  This is not necessarily the case in other cases or proceedings.  

This is their justification:

&gt;""The Civil Procedural Rules Committee is proposing amendment of Rule 1006 to rescind subdivision (a.1), which limits venue in medical professional liability actions to the county in which the cause of action arose. The current rule provides special treatment of a particular class of defendants, which no longer appears warranted. Data compiled by the Supreme Court on case filings on medical professional liability actions (http://www.pacourts.us/news-and-statistics/research-and-statistics/) indicates that there has been a significant reduction in those filings for the past 15 years. Additionally, it has been reported to the Committee that this reduction has resulted in a decrease of the amount of claim payments resulting in far fewer compensated victims of medical negligence.""

Additionally, Tom Wolf and the state tried to strip the state's Joint Underwriting Association (state malpractice insurer, covers hard-to-insure physicians) of $200 million, illegally, to balance the budget.   (
https://whyy.org/articles/judge-halts-pa-s-attempt-take-funds-insurer/)

&gt;""The state created the JUA in 1975, and its funds and surplus have since been kept independent. Its employees don’t get state benefits, it’s not housed in a state building, and a spokeswoman has said the group is entirely funded by contributions from those it insures. So when lawmakers passed a budget plan saying the JUA would be dissolved if it didn’t turn over $200 million by Dec. 1, the group sued.""

And the same state where this is taking place, the same supreme court is deciding on this:

https://www.law.com/thelegalintelligencer/2018/11/01/pa-supreme-court-arguments-on-strict-liability-in-med-mal-exceeded-allocatur-grant-attorney-says/

&gt;""Mitchell sued Shikora, alleging negligence, and later sought to exclude evidence about whether bowel injury was a known risk or complication of the surgery. Although the trial court did not allow in evidence related to informed consent, including conversations between Shikora and Mitchell or evidence of Mitchell’s consent despite the risks, the jury was allowed to hear about the general risks and complications associated with a laparoscopic surgery.

&gt;The jury rendered a defense verdict, and Mitchell subsequently appealed, arguing that the court should not have included any information about the risks and complications. Last year, a three-judge panel of the Superior Court held that, even though the defendants argued the information was necessary to establish the standard of care, allowing in the evidence was prejudicial to the plaintiffs.""

and https://www.lambmcerlane.com/articles/pennsylvania-supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-case-involving-admissibility-of-risks-and-complications-evidence/

&gt;Before trial, Plaintiff filed a motion to prevent Defendants from explaining to the jury how bowel perforation was a risk or complication of a hysterectomy. The trial court denied the motion and permitted the evidence. After the jury returned a defense verdict, the Plaintiff appealed.

&gt;On appeal, the Superior Court reversed and granted a new trial. Specifically, the Superior Court held that Defendants’ evidence regarding “risks and complications” was irrelevant; moreover, the Court held that its introduction violated an earlier Supreme Court decision (Brady v. Urbas, 111 A.3d 1155 (Pa. 2015)), which precluded evidence of informed consent in certain negligence cases. The Superior Court also found that evidence regarding “risks and complications,” if permitted, would prejudice the Plaintiff.

&gt;If the Superior Court’s decision is permitted to stand, they argued, physicians would be subject to a strict liability standard, would become de facto guarantors of patient safety and would be potentially liable for any harm – even harm caused by a complication and not by negligence. Defendants and amici also pointed out how the Superior Court’s decision will undoubtedly affect the practice of medicine overall by making physicians less likely to perform high-risk procedures. Finally, Defendants argued, if physicians can be held liable for all harm sustained by a patient simply because the surgery or procedure resulted in complications, malpractice rates will increase – to the detriment of the physicians and the general public.

I didn't want him to pay that amount or send him home to have him try to get one and risk not getting back before we closed. I took about 5 extra minutes asking him questions and setting him up with the card. His copay ended up being $10. He was shocked and extremely happy I was able to save him so much. I printed out the card for him in case he wanted to fill it somewhere else. He said he appreciated it but he seriously doubted he would go anywhere else.

Maybe its just because I haven't dealt with NABP recently, but I don't remember this much exhaustive and expensive red tape even as recently as 2013.

My name is Meredith Newman and I'm the health reporter for The News Journal/Delaware Online, part of the USA Today Network. For the past year, I reported on how some young Amish children are victims of biological chance, suffering from rare genetic conditions that stem from interwoven family trees. Surprisingly, the type of care medically complex Amish children receive is likely the future of medicine for the wider population. 

My reporting culminated in the series [""Saving Grace,""](https://www.delawareonline.com/in-depth/news/health/2018/12/12/dover-amish-community-some-children-victims-genetic-diseases/2124246002/) which focuses on a Delaware Amish family. The Millers have had three children die of a rare disorder that doctors at one time didn't have a name for. Nothing doctors tried could save John David or Carolyn or Martha Ann Miller. But it might save cousin Grace. 

Today, I'll be joined by Drs. Matt Demczko and Michael Fox, who treat Amish children at Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware.

Christmas article. MRI assessment of the optimal type of traditional pork roast and preparation method – a randomised blinded trial

Ugeskr Læger 2018;180:V70270

INTRODUCTION: Pork roast is part of the traditional Danish Christmas meal and has been so for several hundreds of years. A novel cooking method is sous vide, in which the meat under vacuum is cooked for a long time at low temperature. Can MRI predict the optimal type of traditional pork roast and the optimal preparation method: oven or sous vide preparation?

METHODS: Two different pork roasts, one from an ordinary pig and one from a pig from an organic farm, were divided in two and randomised to oven cooking or sous vide. All four roasts underwent MRI at 1.5 tesla before and after preparation for evaluation of the fat content, as fat has an influence on taste. A test panel blinded to type of roast evaluated taste, juiciness and texture.

RESULTS: Eleven persons participated in the tasting (three men, eight women). Median age group was 30-39 years, and the median consumption of pork roast was once every half year. All roasts lost weight during the preparation. The favourite roast among participants was the one from an organic farm cooked sous vide.

CONCLUSION: Pork roast cooked sous vide instead of oven-cooked was preferred among different healthcare professionals blinded to the type of preparation.",3,52,2019-01-11,PHARMA,0.04352149739861488,0.9284360408782959,0.028042510151863098

medicine,Question about responding to patients who want all of the tests regardless of evidence. (when less is more),"No doubt discussed here before, but I need a better understanding as to why it is better practice to order tests conservatively (If it is at all):-

Put simply: 

If a patient comes in, and money is no problem, why should you not relent and test them for things that there is little evidence to test for if it assuages their fears?

I understand that the answer probably lies partially in statistics - that is - if we test 100 people randomly for X, then the likelihood of false positives will mean patients are unnecessarily subjected to possibly invasive and expensive procedures, but I think this must be a very surface level understanding.

I would sincerely appreciate any links to previous questions similar to this, links to articles related, and just any explanations. I want a strong understanding of this and hopefully evidence to back up the answer.

medicine,So you want to start a union?,"I see comments on this sub frequently stating physicians need to unite/unionize, etc. I think that's a great thing but people have been saying the same thing in pharmacy for eons and jackshit has been done to actually do it. But rather than say you are screwed, if you folks want, I'll help you unite and start fighting back.

If you're wondering why a JD gives a shit or wtf I know about getting this done, I'll explain. I was a member of a non-profit for an orphan condition that provided support for patients. One pharmaceutical company, whose sole source of income depends on this condition, well over a billion dollars, donated half of the entire budget for the nonprofit and basically took control of the organization. Said pharmaceutical company, sent letters threatening to take the medication away from the patients unless they signed a HIPAA waiver allowing the company to use protected information for marketing purposes. I've seen some sketchy shit but I couldn't believe it. Naturally I suggested we fight back and I would look into suing the fuckers.

Shortly after, the nonprofit, with almost no notice, terminated the support group, which had existed for close to a decade and had tens of thousands of posts and thousands of members. Apparently the pharmaceutical company  wasn't pleased with the criticism. The member begged them to keep it functioning and we couldn't even get a response. It devastated the community. No one knew what to do and felt helpless. So I did something crazy, I suggested we start our own. Naysayers were vocal, saying it was hopeless. No one else stepped up to lead, so I did. We reached our funding goal in less than a day and we were up and running in two weeks. A year later we were the largest group for the condition and page one on Google.

An insider MD I've been friends with for years confirmed it was the pharmaceutical company behind the shutdown. The MD was terrified regarding retaliation and was worried I'd face their wrath if I caused trouble. Pretty sure the MD thought I was nuts when I said they could bring it on. After chatting with them later, the MD expressed their frustration with the current state of medicine, namely administration. The MD loves medicine and is one of the kindest people I've ever known, but seemed to be miserable for the same reasons you folks mention. It pissed me off so here I am.

So I know a thing or two about starting an organization and rallying people to a common cause, not to mention the legal bullshit that entails. It's a lot of work but despite not making a dime, saving that group was unquestionably the most rewarding thing I've ever done.

After living half my life with an undiagnosed condition and one physician that broke the time limit rules and went way beyond adequate care, diagnosed it and changed my life forever, I am physician advocate to the end. My wife is also an MD.

I can't lead the charge on this one. One of you folks commented months ago suggesting, I organize physicians but the letters at the end of my name sort of preclude that. But I can help and participate if just a handful of you are passionate, willing to take action and able devote your time to change.

With or without me, stop just talking. It's getting worse and it's going to become harder to change the more time passes. Take action. Physicians and their patients deserve better.

Apologies for the personal story. I figured the post wouldn't make sense without some background. I'm happy to provide more information on how to get this going if you folks are interested.

Don't get hung up on the word union. An association might be a better option. I just used union because that's what most people talk about. The key is to identify the best organizational structure for the objective. I can explain in greater detail later.

Edit:

Thank you all for commenting. I was hoping, and still hope, one of you will take charge of this mess. My intent was not to lead but to inspire and assist the doctors who would take the helm. It's an interesting world we live in when a attorney ends up advocating for medical professionals. I am happy to do as much as I can if need be. My apologies if I haven't replied to messages. My inbox died but I'll try to reply later. I haven't had any resilience training so I need sleep /s

Edit:

For the skeptics, I scored in the 90th percentile on the lsat, went to the best law school in the state, had the highest score on one or two sections of the bar in my state, have been a partner at two firms and started my own 5 years ago. This is my bookshelf. The paper says masteroflaw but imgur ruined the resolution so it's hard to read.

[https://imgur.com/a/QP21RA6](https://imgur.com/a/QP21RA6)

Also to the folks saying I don't know what I'm talking about regarding unions because they read it on Google, you might consider how it feels when a patient does that to you regarding medicine. Let's please be respectful. I have not asked anyone for their personal information or money. I'm just trying to help. I sent the mods the link to my nonprofit in the story. Defrauding people is a felony and I'd get disbarred. I'd rather spend my time working for you, not defending myself. Wouldn't you? I understand skepticism and don't find it offensive but I would ask to be treated with the same professional respect I show to physicians and other medical professionals.

I am really inspired and motivated by the vast number of supportive comments. I'm a little overwhelmed with the sheer number of replies so for those wanting to help and have the time, please let me know how much time you can devote. I'm happy to guide you if you don't know what to do.

Edit. Day 6. We've abandoned Discord and switched to slack. We've got a small team together and are planning and information gathering. I'll post updates, assuming my wife doesn't murder me.

medicine,I almost missed a STEMI and I feel awful about it,"On a night shift last week, I was covering all of the medical wards. I received a bleep at about 4am from a nurse who said the patient was tachy, so she did an ECG. The patient had been NBM for several days and slow fluids were running. I flicked through the obs at the time of the call and apart from a rate of 120bpm, everything else was normal. He had no PMH and the nurse said he was okay, just running fast. 

I continued to review sick patients on other wards - desaturating, septic etc. At 7am, I finally got to the ward to review the ECG and my jaw dropped. I’ve never seen such textbook ST elevation. My heart sank and I felt so, so guilty. He went for emergency PCI and I don’t know what happened since. 

I can’t stop thinking about it. I was thinking that he might be tachy because he was dehydrated and I prioritised other patients. Honestly, he was probably the 4/5th on my list. What if I hadn’t had the time to review him before morning handover and I’d completely missed the STEMI? I can’t imagine what would’ve happened. It’s affecting my sleep, I keep dreaming about it. 

This situation has taught me to always try to review ECGs immediately but what happens when bleeps about other sick patients take priority?

medicine,Starting a solo practice (husband’s POV),"I’m the husband of a fiercely intelligent woman who also happens to be an ob/gyn. Last year she quit working for the doctor she’s been with since finishing residency to start her own solo practice. I also work full time but try to help her with various aspects of her business in my free time. It has a whirlwind of a year but we are both surprised by how positive things have turned out so far. 

Running a solo practice was an idea she would have scoffed at when she was in her residency and looking for a job. We live in an expensive coastal city. Most of her friends went to work for one of the large hospital systems and a few went into academics. Doctors are quite the risk adverse type of people given on my own impressions.

It helps that her patients love her and many followed her when she moved. She kept her hospital privilege and the new office was just around the corner, so patients probably didn’t mind much. Volumes were low in the beginning but we also kept the expenses low. I built her a website using WIX so we avoided paying expensive web designers. We spend about $500 a month for Google AdWords, which has really helped grown her pt volumes organically. The biggest expense each month is rent. But everything else is pretty manageable. It also boggled my mind how little MAs get paid: we received dozens of resumes overnight after posting the opening for a job that pays on average $16 an hour. How do they afford to live in an expensive city like this one?

Changes to her lifestyle have been both good and bad. She dictates her own hours now, which are nearly the same as before. But she doesn’t have anyone to share calls with, so we can’t take vacations or so much visit friends that live more than 2 hours drive away. 

We are now in the process of buying a medical office space instead of keep renting, so her patients can find her in a more permanent location. There are so many older doctors looking to retire but so few young ones want to buy their own commercial space that the dynamics are working greatly in our favor. We keep getting offers from seller that would never happen for the residential real estate market here. However we are struggling a bit to find a bank that will lend to us at a reasonable rate because the practice doesn’t have that long of a history.

Things are going well so far and I’m proud of my gal. She works hard but is also notably happier being on her own. Helping her, sometimes we fight over difference in opinions, especially at times when I feel like my efforts are under-appreciated. But overall I enjoy the work I do for her and this past year has brought us closer and made our marriage stronger.",19,59,2019-01-19,PHARMA,0.030514687299728394,0.8888092041015625,0.0806761309504509

I wonder if the patients will over obsess over ""worst-case scenario A"" if I include that, until the test comes through?

On the flip side, if it turns out they have ""Worst-case scenario A"", they will feel betrayed by my lack of transparency.

# How to write a great fellowship acceptance post

1. State your excitement, humility, and gratitude. Thank people and supreme beings. Be sure to thank family because grandma and grandpa will be reading your LinkedIn
2. State all the details about the fellowship program. Elongate the title. Longer the title the more flex
3. Consider posting a picture of yourself in front of the company building/logo. Hold a Starbucks coffee cup in the pic to show you are a corporate yuppie on the move
4. Mention that your company is a leader. Everyone is a leader. Its like elementary school where everyone gets an award for participation. Let's give leadership awards to every pharmaceutical company. Highlight the innovation happening at your company even if your company hasn't truly innovated in over a decade and primary revenue stream is off a drug about to undergo loss of exclusivity. Completely ignore facts such as missed earnings, decline in market cap, layoffs, hiring freezes, and other realities. Do not let any company financials or science tell you that your company is not leader. Flex away
5. Share what you will be doing in the fellowship. Throw the word strategy in there. Sprinkle the words like ""global"" and ""headquarters"" in there too. Let people know you are in the Major Leagues. More flex
6. Post on LinkedIn so your future boss and future employers can admire your commitment to impacting patients on a global scale

I am very excited to announce that on *\[insert date\]*, I officially accepted the invitation to join the exclusive, prestigious, world renowned *\[insert fellowship program\]* to be a *\[insert fellowship title; longer the title more important the fellowship\]* at *\[insert company name\]* in \[*insert city/state; perhaps mention why it is the best place in the world*\]. After a long journey filled with countless interviews, receptions, flights around the country, onsite presentations, and dinners, I was honored to receive multiple fellowship offers. After consulting with my advisers, I decided to bring my skills to *\[insert company name\]*, a global leader in *\[insert therapeutic area; talk about company here\]* that is fully committed to helping patients live better lives. During my Fellowship, I will cure diseases, improve patients lives, and make a global impact. I will be developing strategy and implementing tactics. In addition, I will also be a professor teaching the future leaders of pharmacy and industry about therapeutics, drug development, and more.  
I want to take a moment to thank myself, God, and all of my friends and family who have been so supportive of me over the past few years - I could not have done this without you. I would also like to thank my preceptors and mentors for their guidance and for teaching me so much about everything. Hard work paid off, and I will strive to make you all proud.  
I am beyond excited to be starting my career on the most innovative and patient-focused team in industry, and I cant wait to see what kind of impact I can have on the millions of patients that are involved.

Anyway, spent the weekend pulling all the hardcopies and I go in to work tomorrow and will call the doctors office. Any advice on how to handle it?

medicine,Acute Otitis Media in Children: My Approach,"A common sentiment I hear from physicians who see acute cases (FP, ED, Peds) is that they feel that parents expect antibiotics for children with acute otitis media (AOM).  I'd like to share my approach to these cases.  I'm a primary care pediatrician in a suburban/semi-rural facility (USA) with an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population.  I see \~4,000 patients per year.  In a typical year, I will prescribe antibiotics to treat AOM maybe 6-7 times (yes, it's \*that\* rare since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine).  I have never had a case in which a child had a poor outcome due to a missed diagnosis.

Parental awareness of acute otitis media is very high.  In the United States, I think that most American parents have a cultural bias towards suspicion of AOM.  I frequently hear complaints such as: ""She's been touching her ear for a month.  I think she might have an ear infection,"" or ""My mother-in-law said that he tugged his ears yesterday and said I should get him checked for an ear infection.""  Obviously, children do not have untreated AOM for a month and AOM is a very uncomfortable condition for the child.

It's important to understand the diagnosis.  The information that I am going to give comes mostly from the 2013 AAP Guidelines on AOM and it \*only applies to children over 60 days of age.\*  Going back to our first year of medical school, we recall that acute focal infections present with four signs: CALOR, RUBOR, TUMOR, and (most importantly) DOLOR.  If the child has no ear complaint, then the child does not have AOM.  I frequently see completely healthy children being put on antibiotics for an ""incidental finding"" of AOM on presentation for an unrelated complaint (examination after motor vehicle accident, for example).  AOM is never an occult process.  There will be a history of ear pain or discomfort.  Sometimes the pain resolves if the TM ruptures, but then there will be a complaint of drainage.

If a child screams loudly enough, the TM will become erythematous.  This hyperemia is not inflammation.  The TM with AOM is OPAQUE, DULL, and has EFFACED LANDMARKS.  Sometimes, it's more white than red.  If pneumatic otoscopy is available, you will see decreased mobility of the TM.  A red TM or an air/fluid level alone is not sufficient to make the diagnosis.

Before I even look in the ear of a child with a complaint of otalgia (ear pain), I first *get the history* and then I review the AAP guidelines for treatment with the parents.  This is what I call ""expectation management.""  I explain it to them very much like I explain it to my medical students.

""Before I look in your child's ear, I want to discuss ear infections and what the American Academy of Pediatrics has to say about them.  First, between 90 and 95% of ear infections are caused by viruses, and those won't respond to antibiotics and usually go away in less than two days.  So if I were to give antibiotics to every kid with an ear infection, I'd have to give 10-20 kids antibiotics to make one kid better, which isn't a very good number.  (note: most parents are aware that antibiotics are not without their risks).

""In order to bring that number down to somewhere between 2 and 4, I follow a set of rules laid out by the AAP.  I'll start your child on antibiotics if:

1. The ear pain has been present for more than 48 hours.\*
2. The ear pain is not responding to appropriate doses of Tylenol or Motrin (*note: parents usually under-dose because they follow the instructions on the box.  The manufacturers of these medications very responsibly tend to guess low on their dosing recommendations so as to avoid overdoses.  Ask the parents what dose they are using*).
3. The child is under 6mo.
4. The ear drum has ruptured and there is pus leaking out.
5. There is a temperature of 102.2F or higher.
6. Your child has special risk factors, such as being an organ transplant patient or having ear tubes or something like that.

""So let me have a look...""

\*Note: if the pain has not been present for 48 hours, then I say: ""And in your case, it hasn't been 48 hours, so if there is an ear infection, I'll give you a kind of prescription called a 'wait-and-see' prescription for antibiotics that can't be filled until (48 hours after they said the pain began).  That way, you don't have to come back if he doesn't improve.  In the mean time, if the pain should get worse and stop responding to pain medication, you can call us and we'll approve an earlier fill on the antibiotic.""

For wait-and-see prescriptions, I put ""WAIT-AND-SEE RX.  PLEASE DO NOT FILL BEFORE 5PM ON 1/25/19"" in the instructions.  I set the expiration date for the prescription for one week after the visit date.

In the vast majority of cases, there either isn't AOM present or there is a resolving viral AOM.  But if there is an AOM, I've already explained what I'm going to do and so now I've set the parents' expectations in line with my action.

I find that parents usually appreciate this explanation and also understand that I am not going to leave them high-and-dry with a screaming child in pain and no way to address it.

&amp;#x200B;

That's how I do it.

medicine,Please stop saying that most acute otitis media is viral.,"This came up in a recent popular post here and I think it deserves attention in and of itself since it is something I hear all the time echoed by residents and other providers. The implication is that viruses are the sole pathogen in the middle ear and that we do not need to treat them.   We know that viruses are very important in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media. Respiratory viruses that cause common colds result in eustachian tube dysfunction that then result in the overgrowth of bacteria in the middle ear cavity. But MOST cases of acute otitis media are in fact cause by bacteria or bacteria and viruses together.   Here is the break down based on conventional and molecular diagnostics:  Bacteria alone- 27%,  Bacteria+virus - 66% , VIRUSES ALONE- 4% and no pathogen - 4 %.  Here are two sources ( reviews of the topic  from leaders in the field) where this came from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3305843/, https://cmr.asm.org/content/cmr/16/2/230.full.pdf. Yes viruses are detected in the majority of cases but bacteria are present in most as well.   While I support judicious use of antibiotics for otitis media and in many cases watchful waiting or delayed prescribing is a good thing.  The evidence for benefit of antibiotics is not great, (/www.cochrane.org/CD000219/ARI_antibiotics-for-acute-middle-ear-infection-acute-otitis-media-in-children) but that may have to do with factors much different than having a viral etiology.

medicine,"AMA: We are the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation (ASF), a team of snakebite experts working to address one of the most neglected tropical diseases in the world. Ask us anything!","Good morning r/medicine!

We are the [Asclepius Snakebite Foundation](https://www.snakebitefoundation.org), an international 501(c)3 non-profit organization led by many of the world experts in snakebite medicine, herpetology, venomology and public health education that is dedicated to reducing the death and disability caused by snakebite envenoming worldwide. We have brought a few of our clinicians/snakebite experts here to answer any questions about snakes, snakebites, snakebite treatment, antivenoms, venoms, or whatever else comes up. We don’t have a specific agenda other than raising awareness for the snakebite crisis worldwide and educating people about snakebites, so ask us anything that interests you about the topic and we will do our best to give you a good answer.

First, some background on the snakebite crisis and our strategy for addressing it: Every year over 138,000 people are killed and another 500,000 are permanently disabled by snakebites worldwide, mostly in Africa and Asia. These numbers may in fact be low estimates because many of the areas that are believed to be hardest hit by snakebite lack effective public health reporting systems. Many of these tragic outcomes could be prevented with effective antivenom use, yet it is estimated that less than 5% of patients receive lifesaving antivenom treatment. Our mission is to reverse the vicious cycle of tragic snakebite outcomes through a combination of innovative research, clinical medicine, and education-based public health initiatives. We employ a multidisciplinary approach that involves heading into the field to capture the world’s deadliest snakes and collect venom samples for antivenom research, establish snakebite treatment centers to train local docs/nurses in snakebite management and provide treatment to patients free of charge, conduct clinical research to develop novel strategies for snakebite treatment, and implement public health outreach and education programs.

&amp;#x200B;

We recently set up this reddit account for our foundation and thought it would be a great opportunity to do an AMA for the medical community on an unusual topic that tends to generate a lot of interest. Snakebite is a subject that medical providers receive very little formal training in. All of our ASF docs and medics spend quite a bit of time teaching other medical professionals about snakebite and have found that old wives tales, myths, and generally bad information are far more common than good science on this subject. Our hope is that this little Q&amp;A on reddit will help to dispel some of these pervasive myths and teach our fellow clinicians about what to actually do for these complex patients.

Since many of us (and many of you!) work shifts, this AMA will run for the next 24 hours. Three of our experts will be available to answer questions during that time:

* Jordan Benjamin (founder, herpetologist, wilderness paramedic, and snakebite researcher with a focus on snakebite management in austere environments) will be answering as u/snakebitefoundation
* Dr. Ben Abo is an emergency medicine &amp; EMS physician, paramedic, clinical assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Florida, and the medical director of the elite Venom One and Venom Two response teams of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue and Lake County Fire Rescue. These teams make up the only national-level antivenom bank in the United States. Ben is a co-founder of ASF and will be answering questions as u/venom1doc
* Dr. Nick Brandehoff is an emergency medicine physician, medical toxicologist, and assistant clinical professor of the department of emergency medicine and division of toxicology at the University of California San Francisco-Fresno program. Nick is a co-founder of ASF and will be answering questions as u/ToxDoc10

If you want to learn more about our team you can [check out the bio page on our website](https://www.snakebitefoundation.org/teamsnakebite/).

Once again, we aren't selling anything and don’t have a specific agenda other than raising awareness for the snakebite crisis worldwide and educating people about snakes and snakebites. Bring your best questions and we will bring our best answers. We are looking forward to talking with all of you!

Sincerely,

The ASF Team

pharmacy,Community pharmacists: do you inform patients when their providers are abusive?,"An incident at work today got me thinking - when, if ever, is it appropriate to inform a patient of abusive behavior towards pharmacy staff? Is it unprofessional to do so? 

At my store, we have a few physicians whose offices we dread calling, because either the physician or their staff members will belittle the techs (or less often, the pharmacist), yell, hang up mid-conversation, etc. If that weren’t bad enough, it’s always in a way that delays patient care. Today, for example, we spent hours paging and being hung up on over a “lost” voicemail. The patient (who got their meds days later than they should have) has no idea. 

Of course, the vast majority of the professionals we interact with are fine, or even pleasant and helpful. Has anyone had any success firing the stinkers? 

**edit: below is the event, for context** 

the patient is a kid with a uti, and needed an antibiotic change. They told the parent yesterday that they’d call it in, and we never got it. So we call today when the parent shows up, and the office doesn’t have the info, and says they’ll page the doctor. He calls us, says he already sent it and won’t talk to anyone but a pharmacist and hangs up if we put him on hold.

Are these posted on company website and one has to choose ""no preference"" for the location? Do the big chain pharmacies have a way of submitting an application that will be considered for nation-wide positions based on availability?

pharmacy,Just got my first job offer! But I have some questions..,"Hi everyone. I am just about to graduate from pharmacy school and was offered a position in Seattle. I am really excited, but also have some concerns. The job offer I got was over the phone. On the phone, the hiring manager said that it was for $25/hr for 32 hours/week until I get officially licensed, and then it will increase to $54.50/hr as a pharmacist.  

 
My concerns are: 
  
1) Even though I did get a follow-up email with the offer, the offer says it is a ""verbal offer"" contingent on completing a background check/drug test/training. Does this mean I could end up not getting the job even if I complete those things since it isn't in writing?   
2) No information was mentioned about hours/week as a pharmacist, overtime, or benefits. Is it ok to ask about these when I haven't received a written offer yet?   
3) I am not from Seattle, and am not sure where to start to see what Net Pay for the area would be. I'd like a potential budget to help guide my decision to take the job or not. How can I figure that out?   
4) I have never had a full-time job before, only seasonal and part time. What kinds of questions should I be asking that I don't even know to ask?   

5) I would need to take the law exam in Washington state, but don't know where to start. Should I just start reading the actual law? Does anyone from Washington/Seattle know of a good review book/course that teaches the law?

pharmacy,I'm a pharmacist who learned how to code on my own and automate some pharmacy work. AMA,"Hi everyone, recently I commented on the career thread about my experience learning to code as a pharmacist and automating pharmacy work. Someone wanted me to expand on it, so here we go!

**Background**

I worked as a community pharmacist in Canada for a couple of years. When I graduated I felt like I had more free time than when I was in school, so I explored learning different things, one of which was coding. Initially I worked with a friend to make some websites and blogs and got my first exposure to web design and basic coding. Even learning the basics opens up your eyes to so many possibilities. I saw that there were quite a few tasks in the pharmacy that were very repetitive and could be automated.

For my first program, I decided to make software that could help track lab values better for patients taking clozapine. If you're not familiar with this, patients taking clozapine have to go for lab tests regularly (WBC and ANC) due to the risk of fatal agranulocytosis. In the first six months, they have to go weekly. In the next six months, they can go every two weeks. And after a year of no complications, they need to go every 4 weeks. Our system was a combination of excel spreadsheets, paper, and the existing software provided by each company that manufactured clozapine. The software I made allowed the pharmacist to keep track of all their patients in one location. If you're interested in learning how to make something like this, see the 'Web app' and 'data visualization' tracks below.

Another program I made would figure out which 'daily dispense' prescriptions were going to expire soon. Daily dispense prescriptions allow you to dispense a medication each day and be reimbursed for the dispensing fee daily (useful for patients with poor compliance). However they expire in 60 days rather than 1 year. The pharmacy I worked out had a large number of these patients, and so we had to manually scroll through a spreadsheet to check for due dates. This task would take 1-1.5 hours. I made a desktop app that automatically parsed through the spreadsheet to figure out prescriptions were expiring soon, and order them into a nice list (see the 'data science' track below).

Another program I made was ineedmymeds This was a fun project at a data hackathon where the theme was to make something using open source data. The premise of the project was that whenever there's a manufacturer shortage for a medication and the patient's pharmacy doesn't have it, the patient and pharmacist have to call around other pharmacies to figure out who has it. We thought it would be interesting if there was a web app for patients to say which meds they want (without revealing their info) and pharmacies could take a look at which meds were requested and see which ones they have in stock. Then this info would be available on the site. Unfortunately it's been difficult getting people to use the site. If you're interested in making something like this, see the 'web app' and 'web design' tracks below.

It was at that hackathon where I met my current employer. He thought the idea was interesting so we worked on it together. Afterwards, I mentioned that I wanted to transition into a software developer job and he hired me since he saw how I worked and some of my previous projects.

**Learning to code on your own recommendations**

I think that instead of a general approach to learning how to code, you should think about what sort of project you want to do. It's a more holistic way of learning. Are you interested in munging through data (excel spreadsheets) and automating that work or finding interesting patterns? Are you interested in making web apps? Are you interested in data visualization and cool charts and graphics?

It's a lot easier and more fun to learn to code when you're working on something you really want to make. Here is a list of tracks and what resources I recommend.

***Data science***

* Python is probably the go-to language you want to learn

1.Absolute beginner:

* Code academy ([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3))  ($)
   * When I took the program it was free, but now it's paid. Regardless, I started out with this program and do recommend it if you don't have any experience at all.

2.Basic python

* Think Python book ([https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)) (free)
   * After doing the codeacademy course, I moved onto this free book. It definitely improved my programming abilities significantly.

3.Basic Data science:

* Data camp ([https://www.datacamp.com/courses/tech:python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/tech:python)) ($)
   * I've taken a few of the data camp courses and can recommend some of them. It'll teach you some basic skills to manipulate data and create visualizations.

4.Machine learning:

* Fast ai ([https://www.fast.ai/](https://www.fast.ai/)) (free)
   * This is only for more advanced programmers but the fast ai course is absolutely phenomenal. It's specifically targeted for programmers and you don't need an advanced math degree since the instructor explains concepts very well.

***Data visualization***

* I would recommend learning javascript because the best data visualization libraries for the web, IMO, are written in javascript

1.Absolute beginner:

* Code academy ([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)) (free)
   * Again, code academy is a great place to start for absolute beginners.

2.Basic javascript:

* Watchandcode ([https://watchandcode.com/](https://watchandcode.com/)) (free course and $premium tier)
   * The instructor at watchandcode is one of the best programming teachers I've ever had. I highly recommend his free course, and if you're interested in improving your javascript skills to the intermediate level, take his premium course.

3.Data visualization with D3.js ([https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507#](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507#)) (free)

* D3.js is a tool that is considered the go-to for data visualization on the web. I actually haven't taken this specific udacity course, but I've taken another udacity one before and they tend to be okay.

***Web app***

* I would recommend python since the web app framework Flask is very simple to learn and get started with.

1.Absolute beginner:

* Code academy ([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3))  ($)

2.Basic python

* Think Python book ([https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)) (free)

3.Flask book ([https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/)) ($)

* Flask is web framework that's very popular amongst python programmers. It's also simple to get started with. This book is the go-to resource for learning flask.

***Web design***

* Enjoy making fancy websites and cool designs? HTML and CSS is what you want to learn
* Shay Howe has a fantastic free resource to learn the fundamentals ([https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/))
* Afterwards, you can try to pick up more advanced CSS layout methods like flexbox ([https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))

***Comp Sci***

* If you're interested in learning more comp sci stuff, I would actually recommend getting some practical coding skills first. Python is a good first language to learn

1.Absolute beginner:

* Code academy ([https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3))  ($)

2.Comp sci course:

* Harvard's CS50 ([https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x))
   * I haven't taken this specific course, but it's highly recommended. You can also pay for a certification once you finish it.

3.Structure and interpretation of computer programs (SICP) (free)

* This is basically the bible of introductory CS ([https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)). It's difficult to get through (I'm still working on it!) but your programming skills will increase significantly.
* If you prefer a video version, Berkely offers a modern alternative: [https://cs61a.org/](https://cs61a.org/)

***Linux***

* Learning how to use linux is very helpful if you're interested in programming in an environment that makes it easier to get all the tools and dependencies you need. Or if you like working on servers and stuff.

1. Try using Ubuntu. You can even just try it out on a usb stick ([https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/index.html](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/index.html)). If you're using Windows 10, you can use the linux subsystem ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)) (free!!!)
2. Learn how to use the linux command line ([https://nostarch.com/tlcl2](https://nostarch.com/tlcl2)) ($)
3. Then dive deeper into how linux works ([https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks2](https://nostarch.com/howlinuxworks2)) ($)

**Boot camps, comp sci degrees and full online programs?**

Some people like an environment with instructors and other peers. If that's you, here are some thoughts about boot camps, comp sci degrees and online programs. I would still recommend taking a shot at one of the tracks above to see if you actually enjoy coding before you invest significant time and money into a formal program. The programs in the self-learning track above may cost a bit, but much less than what you'd have to pay for formal programs.

I did not go this route so do take this with a grain of salt.

Many boot camps seem to be taking advantage of the hot market so you really need to do your research. Go to their demo days and talk to the grads. Then talk to people who have finished the program and are a few months out. See what they actually end up doing. I've seen crazy stats where more than half of the boot camp grads do not actually end up in a software developer job.

One boot camp that I've heard good things about is Lambda School ([https://lambdaschool.com/](https://lambdaschool.com/)) because their incentive is to get you as high paying a job as possible since they only get paid if you get a good paying job.

As for comp sci degrees, find out if your local uni/college offers a condensed version. The condensed versions seem to be offered towards people already with a bachelor's so they tend to be only 2-3 years in length rather than 4. Generally I've heard good things about these, but of course they depend on the school itself.

Online programs vary quite a bit. A popular one is the nanodegree offered by Udacity. Again, you really need to talk to the grads in the programs that you're interested in and figure out the reality of those programs and not what is advertised.

**But what about certifications?!**

Yes, yes, I'm getting to it. With the self-learning track you won't get any certifications. BUT, you'll have a great portfolio because you'll be learning to build practical projects and you might even have a project of your own. It's a lot easier to learn comp sci fundamentals when you have practical skills, than if you learn comp sci theory without any coding background.

If you want certifications, look at what topics you're interested in and pick out some courses from Coursera or Edx where they offer a certification of completion. For example, this one is a very popular intro to compsci course ([https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)) that offers a certification if you pay $90, or free if you don't want the certification.

Learning to code has become much easier over these last few years. If you still feel a bit overwhelemed, I'm thinking of setting up an online course where I can teach what I've learned, and some of the projects I've made that are actually used in the pharmacy. I don't want to be spammy, so if you're interested in this, send me a DM (or let me know if you want me to reply with a link here or in the comments below).

Feel free to ask questions!

medicine,Any advice for how to practice without constant fear of litigation?,"Goin' out on a limb here...

Upon graduation from residency (now years ago) I was named in a lawsuit for a case that had a terrible outcome and I think it has left a mark on me. I went into a legitimate depression for at least 6mo up to a year while the discovery went on and subsequently the deposition. It was a case I knew very well as I had learned of the outcome shortly after. I have dealt with my own demons over the case and I’m confident it was truly not any of my own doing, my attending actually over-rode my own inclinations at the time, which may or may not have changed outcomes but regardless, the guilt and sadness I felt (and crazily still feel as I write this) is immense.

I had looked forward to being done with the whole thing only to subsequently be named in a second lawsuit where I am truly only a peripheral player but am still getting deposed. I’m sure I’m not alone in saying these processes are terribly draining. They last for years, every action you do and word you write despite how minuscule is scrutinized, and it’s a constant feeling of guilty until proven innocent, despite potentially doing the best you could do with what was available at the time.

I have since found myself an amazing job that I truly love, something I really never thought I’d say. I’m fortunate enough to be compensated well and not required to work a ton, but if I could just work even 25% more a month for like a year or two I could pay off all of my loans quickly and be debt free! What I’ve recently realized is that the ONLY thing preventing me from doing this is fear of litigation. Every extra shift, every extra patient, in the back of my mind is seen as opening a door to a potential lawsuit. I feel I am well respected amongst my peers, my staff, and my patients, and I do my best to practice good EBM and am very aware of the standards of care in my specialty.  More often than not it’s usually something I find myself dwelling on after the fact, but it’s becoming exhausting, and it’s limiting my ability to enjoy a job I otherwise get so much satisfaction from. Even cases of near catastrophes that I was influential in preventing, something that I should possibly be celebrating and finding confidence in, I find myself looking for the holes that the lawyer will undoubtedly eventually drag my nose through.

I know lawsuits are an unfortunate part of American medicine so I’m not alone in these experiences and need to expect them, but I’m wondering if anyone has any advice as to how to deal with this in a more productive manner?
