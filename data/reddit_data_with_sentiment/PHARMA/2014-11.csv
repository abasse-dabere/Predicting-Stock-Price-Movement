medicine,"Serum Lipase &gt;10,000","Hi, Meddit! Graduate nursing student here. 

I'm writing up a case study on a train wreck of an ICU patient. Arrived walkie/talkie with abdominal pain and nausea vomiting x1week. Fast forward 25 days... And he's still in the ICU, intubated (we actually just finally trach'd him), on every drip known to man, acute pancreatitis, sepsis (still had WBCs&gt;35, procaclitonin &gt;88), probably MODS. He 'graduated' from CRRT to HD... And his labs are just a mess. He has a bili drain in place... The ERCP was unsuccessful... Too swollen to see or cannulate anything. Abdominal CT revealed pseudocysts and lots of swelling. 

His serum lipase is still trending upward... We're &gt;10,000 now. My clinical instructor thinks that I typo'd the lab... 

I'm having some trouble finding much literature on lipase levels this high... But does it not point to biliary etiology? And pretty much rule out alcoholism? The dude had virtually no medical hx (GERD, hyperlipidemia) and denied history of alcohol/drug use. Are levels this high common? Or, at least not uncommon? 

Any light from your experience would be helpful! üëç

pharmacy,Is there anything I should have done differently?,"I'm a patient, not a pharmacist. I was hoping you guys might be willing to give me an idea regarding what I could/should have done differently in a situation that happened.

I am a regular at a local independent pharmacy (have been going there since early 2012). I'm also on methadone for MMT (that probably matters). On the 24th, I saw my psychiatrist and he prescribed me 25mg of Seroquel (up to 3/day, so 90 tablets) and I filled it that afternoon. On Wednesday night (29th), I went to take my Seroquel and discovered I only had 2 left; clearly, I accidentally spilled the bottle somewhere, but I searched my whole apartment and couldn't even find 1 of them.

I went to the pharmacy and spoke to the owner/pharmacist (with whom I have a good relationship), explained what happened, and asked him if he could please fax my psychiatrist to request an early refill (I wouldn't have even asked if it was a controlled substance).

I know pharmacists get a LOT of stories (especially from addicts like myself), but this was a genuine mystery to me (seriously, I still haven't found them, and I have no reason to lie here). I got the distinct feeling that the staff thought I sold them (or something); I can't really say I blame them, but at the same time I have **never** lost a medication before.

I guess what I'm asking is, is there anything I can do to show them that I didn't sell them or anything like that? Even when I was actively using, I would never sell my medications (I needed them for myself, so why would I?). I'm mortified that this happened and don't want them to think I did something improper.

**Update:** Hi, everyone. I just wanted to thank everyone for your replies. I went in to talk to the owner yesterday, and he opted to just go ahead and give me a refill early. I'm not clear on why he didn't just do that when I went in on Thursday to ask him to fax my doctor (which I assumed he would need to do). Fortunately, my insurance covered the early refill. As for it being a miscount, I was thinking about that and a possibility I considered was that when I get it filled, they may have only had a partial amount in stock and perhaps forgot to mention that I would have to come back for the rest? I am not sure.",26,13,2014-11-02,PHARMA,0.06177951395511627,0.9011507034301758,0.037069763988256454

medicine,Happy Radiology week 2014!,"Greetings /r/medicine !

Every year we celebrate Radiology week during the week of Nov the 8th. It was on this date in 1895 that Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen first produced and detected electromagnetic radiation in a wavelength range today that is known as X-rays. The Radiology community worldwide celebrates this important date with a variety of activities, gatherings, and overall celebration to commemorate the occasion. As expected, reddit's Radiology home will be no different. **Raddit** (/r/radiology) will be running a series of *themes of the day* for Radiology week, and invites anyone who is interested in the daily theme content or would like to participate with a day specific submission!

Here is a brief rundown of the themes:

- Monday, MRI. Post any cases, interesting MR images, stories related to MR, or anything related to this modality.


- Tuesday, Trauma! Title says it all, this day is about interesting cases involving MVAs, falls, and everything in between. As expected, stories are also welcome, as well as radiology related content that includes this theme.


- Wednesday, History. This theme consists of stories and content that is somewhat dated, or features the field of radiology in its earlier days. For example, someone could post an image of old equipment they have at their facility, or an interesting story of how they used to perform/position in radiography ""back in the day"" (think of it as a ""throwback Thursday).


- Thursday, CT. Same as with Monday and MRI, but this time focus on computed tomography and all content pertaining to it.


- Friday, FAIL. One of our favorite themes here in the sub, and often a topic of conversation. Take this day to gather a case or more likely a story in which you or someone you know has screwed up in the field (no names of course).

Once again, we hope some of you will join us to either post or simply seek entertainment in this week's activities. Happy Rad week 2014!",10,48,2014-11-03,PHARMA,0.03985137119889259,0.9325765371322632,0.027572043240070343

medicine,"""Dr. Emergdoc, quick, we need help!""","The Cavalry story made me remember a similar type of episode I experience, which I don't believe I have shared on reddit yet so here goes.  

This happened a long time ago, but I remember it like yesterday.

I'm minding my own business (a very dangerous thing to do) in the emergency, when a nurse comes out of the resuscitation room with a somewhat frantic look in her eyes, with the title of this submission on her lips.  

I didn't even know there was someone in the resus room, and I quickly learn that a patient was having his trach changed by one of the more senior ENT residents.  He was from a chronic care hospital, and had advanced neuromuscular disease, and was on a portable vent that he used at the chronic care hospital.  

He had become hypoxic and bradycardic and unconscious after the trach change.

I'm looking at an unresponsive shriveled up middle aged guy, whose O2 sat is maybe 45% and his heart rate is I think about 30.  

I ask the ENT resident  ""Is the trach in the right place?""  

Yes, he says.

""Are you sure?""

I'll go get my scope! and he immediately runs out of the room, leaving me with the patient and the somewhat flustered nurse.  

Luckily, the voice in the back of my head said ""crashing patient on vent, take the vent out of the picture"" and I disconnected the vent and started to bag the patient.  He was very easy to bag and within a couple of seconds his O2 sat went up and up and his heart rate climbed quickly, and within a minute or two, he regained consciousness.  He wasn't able to speak, but his eyes told me he was very upset about something.

By this time, an RT had arrived, and the ENT resident showed up with his scope.

The RT asked the ENT resident ""Does the patient have a Passy-Muir valve?""

Yes, says the ENT resident.

""Did you blow up the trach cuff?""

Yes, is the reply again.

At this point the RT hisses at the ENT resident ""YOU NEVER BLOW UP THE CUFF IN A PATIENT WITH A PASSY-MUIR VALVE!""

So the educational component of this story is:

A Passy Muir valve is a one way valve which allows air to go into the lungs through the ventilator, but does not allow the air to exit out the trach.  Instead in a trach tube with the cuff down, the air will be expelled through the patients larynx, allowing the patient to talk.  

If you blow up the cuff, the ventilator will stack the breaths until it can't work anymore, and then the patient will become hypoxic and if not corrected, arrest.  Unfortunately, as in this case, the patient was acutely aware of what was happening, and completely unable to communicate the situation to the ENT resident.  

Hence, the nasty look in his eyes, seemed to be directly mainly to the ENT resident.

At the time, I didn't know anything about Passy-Muir valves (and I just detailed the limited knowledge I have of them now) so I did learn something from this unfortunate  incident, as did the nurse and ENT resident.

The patient recovered promptly, and returned to the chronic care hospital.  

One of the most surprising things about this story was the incredibly sharp way the RT spoke to the ENT resident, I have never before or since heard a non-MD health professional talk to an MD in that manner.

Since I had no understanding of what she was saying at the time, I thought she way out of line, but didn't say anything.
Once it was explained to me, I'm surprised she showed so much restraint. 

TL;DR   
 ENT resident almost kills patient, emergdoc learns something he never forgets.",108,181,2014-11-08,PHARMA,0.10268136113882065,0.8698680400848389,0.027450643479824066

medicine,How would you fix the VA?,"My daughter's a PGY-1 IM in a large metropolitan area. She does rounds at University Hospital, County Hospital, and VA Hospital.

When she started in July, she did 2 weeks at the VA, and now that she's on her second rotation there she says she sees how much the attendings and more senior residents were shielding the interns from how things work at the VA.

One thing is that the computers are very slow, to the point where it's difficult to enter orders for critical patients in a timely manner, and sometimes impossible, so people have to improvise. This seems like something that could be easily fixed, but apparently there's no way to do that within the system as it now stands.

More crucial is that the nurses in this VA simply don't seem to care much about their work. I can't really go into detail about that, but one example was a patient who had a potassium level of 2.6, an order was placed, but it wasn't filled until 3 and a half hours later.

Not being a doctor myself and only reporting this as second hand information, I may not be conveying the seriousness of the situation. And then my daughter's an intern, so what does she know? But really, she has a pretty high tolerance for difficult situations.

The ED at County Hospital sometimes has patients holding their own IV bags in the sitting room only section, and shower stalls have been converted into ""private rooms"" for patients on gurneys. But still, that's one of the best ED's in the country, it runs well, and the nurses there are very good at what they do. The same is true of the rest of County Hospital and even more so of University Hospital.

So why is the VA like that, and how can it be fixed?",26,17,2014-11-08,PHARMA,0.041273802518844604,0.9190648198127747,0.03966140374541283

medicine,Any UK hospital doctors? Tell me about your life (please?),"So I'm applying to medicine this year in the uk and have done a variety of work experience in community settings and general practice (particularly in mental health and end-of-life-care). I've really enjoyed the majority of my experiences.

What I've failed with, however, is getting any sort of experience on a hospital ward (other than as a patient/family) therefore while I know the general duties of the doctor and can imagine the day-to-day goings on, I don't actually know what you do in detail on your average week, and I know that there is huge variation regarding the wards you work on, the kind of care you provide, the typical patient group etc.

I would really appreciate if any doctors out there could tell me what a week in your life and on your ward is like (any speciality, any level) other than the fact I'm worried that I could get asked at interview and be completely stumped, I would really love to know what you individually do and what you think of what you do!

Something along the lines of:
What time do you start on the wards and how do you plan your day? 
Is it very structured e.g. always start with ward rounds?
How much time do you actually get to spend with patients? Do you find a lot of your time is spent liaising with other clinical staff and sorting other tasks rather than direct patient contact?
Are your days all quite same-y or are many days unpredictable?
What are the really mundane things that you constantly find yourself doing, that an outsider may be surprised at?
What are your favourite parts of your day/week? and the worst?
How many hours do you really work compared to how many you are scheduled in to do?
Anything else you want to share really!

3.  He *seems* to practice evidence-based medicine on that other TV show he's in.

medicine,[META] Mods from /r/medicine want to hear your opinions about our sub.,"This is a meta post about /r/medicine.


**The current three mods koolkao, emergdoc and pintastico would like your opinion about the direction we should be taking to better serve our target audience. We invite your comments.**

WHEN COMMENTING, STATE YOUR MEDICAL BACKGROUND, IF ANY. For instance, MS-3/RN/MD/DO/paramedic/PA/ etc. etc. or lay person. COMMENTS NOT STATING YOUR BACKGROUND WILL LIKELY BE REMOVED OR IGNORED. If you have a /r/medicine flair which describes it accurately, this will be fine.

**Origins of /r/medicine**

Back in the dark ages before the advent of subreddits, Reddit.com was the social bookmarking website for in-depth, intelligent, and social discussions on news of the day. At the time the vast majority of Redditors were programmers or other folks in the technology field. It was great to listen in on the sometimes highly technical discussions, but us from the medical field could not find a voice on Reddit.

As soon as Subreddits were introduced, /r/medicine was created, with the intention of replicating the main Reddit for the field of Medicine. It would be a place for medical professionals to discuss issues which are of importance to them. We like the analogy of this being like a lounge where you could come in and start discussing things that you would / could discuss with other medical professionals in real life.

**Current state of /r/medicine**

We are hearing from some active Medditors that we should do well to return to our origins. As such, we propose making changes in the format of our sub to **help promote a serious exchange of ideas and knowledge between medical professionals.**

For instance, we currently allow ‚Äúnew link‚Äù posts where the OP simply post a link with no initial discussion, and usually no description of what the link is about. Some of the links are of basic science, animal research, or ‚Äúpotential ‚Äúnew drug breakthroughs, which are, in our opinion, of limited interest to our target audience. A possible change could be to only allow ‚Äúnew text‚Äù posts, where those who wish to post a link could describe the link in the text, paste the link, and initiate discussion of the link. No link karma would earned, but it might save time for our subscribers (and our mods, who read every post) by quickly allowing them to scan through new posts. Plus having every new post submitter stating why they feel the link is important might jump start a discussion. Or simply make it a rule that submitters of ‚Äúnew link‚Äù posts must provide an adequate explanation of the link and initiated discussion or their post will be removed.

We plan to continue to actively discourage and remove: medical advice, and questions from lay public asking us to explain medical facts to them. Questions from medical professionals concerning how a health situation directly affects their professional life are allowed.

/r/medicalschool is a very active sub, and any issues pertaining to medical school should be posted there.

Career advice from practicing medical professionals are considered fair game. Career advice from medical students, pre-med and high school students is much more a grey zone, and frankly not appreciated by many members of our sub.

Another grey zone are questions about personal or financial issues not directly related to being a medical professional.

/r/medicine will, of course still remain a place where you could have a laugh or share a difficult moment.

Changes you may have noticed recently include an active Automoderator. Currently any post from an account less than a week old, or with less than 10 link+comment karma will automatically be removed. This eliminates many cases of spam, when the regular spam filter has not caught it. Posts that appear to seek medical advice will also be flagged for mod review.

Reporting to the mods continues to be a way to quickly alert the mods of problem posts. As all three mods are working MD‚Äôs, there are sometimes periods of many hours when a mod hasn‚Äôt scanned the new posts/comments. Your help here is very important.

**So post your comments on how you feel we can improve this sub. Again, you must identify whether you are a layperson or describe what your medical designation is in your comment.**

/r/medicine belongs to us Medditors, but in order for us to continue to thrive, some changes will be needed. We very much look forward to your input.

I found this article kind of interesting, if only for this mention ...

The 31-year-old had become so distractable, he told his friends, that he had decided to see a psychologist. He emerged from the appointment with prescriptions for an antidepressant and an attention deficit drug, which he took faithfully until, about three weeks later, he suffered a panic attack at work.

May was on a combination of Wellbutrin and Vyvanse ....

Of course, he was experiencing gross paranoid delusions, and no one along the way thinks that ""hey, that is quite possibly amphetamine psychosis, maybe we should reduce the dosage a whole bunch?""

I am not even sure there is that good of an argument for prescribing those two together like that, at least initially.  On an initial appointment, why not just go with Wellbutrin XL 450 MG and be done with it?  It can help plenty by itself in ADHD + depression if given a chance.

medicine,Explaining time off during interviews. Questions about homophobia during interviews,"I'm gonna match with 2016. I took 2 months off after step 1 before starting my cores to deal with personal stuff, which I know they're gonna ask about during interviews.

I was a closeted gay man up until 22 (very religious, strict family. I was too afraid to come out which is why I came out fairly late). When I finally did come out at 22, I just kinda had a meltdown. I thought life would get better but things just seemed to spiral out of control. My mental state was not the best (plus I had just taken step 1 which is enough to make anyone crazy). I did not take time off for drugs or anything of the sort. I sought out therapy, started on meds (which I no longer take--I follow with a psychiatrist, I didn't make the decision on my own), and now feel so so much better. I'm very happy with life and wouldn't trade my situation for anything

So here's my dilemma. Do I tell them the truth in the interview? I don't want to hurt my chances of getting into a good program due to bigotry, because to pretend that homophobia isn't prevalent at the professional level is both a lie and a joke. I don't wanna lie and create some elaborate story (death in the family, something along those lines). I'm kinda lost as to what to do

Basically I'm just asking for opinions. I'm in the midwest right now. Plan on applying to big cities like Seattle, Chicago, LA, San Fran, NY, but also to smaller schools cause I gotta increase my chances of getting accepted. I'm going into radiology if that matters.

In reality I wouldn't wanna go to a school that isn't open to their employees being gay, but I'm terrified of not matching. 

As an aside, I am not flamboyant. Most people don't know I'm gay until I tell them. I would be considered a ""typical heterosexual"" except for I like dudes.

Ideas? Help? Pretty please? Also the reason why I started cores at 22 is cause I went to an accelerated program where I'll be 24 when I get my MD.

I am aware of two pathways into medicine in the states: MD or DO (are there others?).  I understand that DO training is very similar to MD, and that both are legitimate medical doctors.  I know that (and correct me if I am way off) osteopathy uses a 'hands on' approach and 'body manipulation' to help cure/heal, but without significant evidence for effectiveness other than for lower spinal pain. How did this alternative, and globally unrecognised therapy come to be a mainstay of the US system? Is it controversial, or widely accepted? Or do people simply not care? In an increasingly 'evidence-based' and litigious arena it seems out of place to me.

When they would send in RXs for Vicodin 5/500, we would call to change it. It was annoying, but whatever, it's good customer service to ensure our patients received the medication ordered for them.

Then all Hydrocodone containing products went C-II....

Before we actually saw an RX with false product selection, we had received an email from higher management saying that we could not accept them unless they were accurately, so no more Vicodin 5/325 and whatever. We have been extremely fortunate in that we've had almost no issues from our patients when we tell them we have to refuse the RX, because we explain why and they are extremely understanding. The issue comes from the prescribers in that they either are indifferent or ignorant to what medications are actually composed of, which begs the question of how their allowed to prescribe them, but that's another issue entirely. 

 My point, for all of those who have been patient to read all of this horseshit, is how frequently have you been seeing this issue and what are your results?
