Health,"/r/health, perhaps you can help figure out whats wrong. We're at the end of our ropes. :(","FYI, throwaway account.

My girlfriend has sharp pains on mostly her lower right abdomen. In addition to this sometimes her cervix hurts very badly (she went in for a pelvic exam or whatever it is girls get at the OBGYN.) when it is just barely touched. The OBGYN told her it shouldn't hurt that bad and she needed to get it checked out (please see a note below on why the OBGYN could not do more.)***. Sometimes having sex can also make the sharp pains worse.

Also she and I are on a diet and have been working out, and she has actually lost about 10 pounds (not counting water weight we both lost), however, her mid area will swell up and make it looked like she has gained weight.

The third main symptom is that her stomach on the right side is tender to touch.

Also it feels like something is pulling insider of her belly button, like a string that pulls it down.

If she gets up to fast from laying or sitting down it also hurts.

This has been happening for a long time. She did not have insurance in the past, so we couldn't do anything about it. She then applied for medicaid and received benefits. 

Once she got this insurance she was finally able to go to a doctor. Sadly, not many doctors took state insurance and most of those that did were not the greatest doctors (though it was better than nothing).

She went to her general practitioner who referred her to an OBGYN. The OBGYN said it was just a cyst and that nothing was wrong. We then went to the emergency room when the OBGYN wouldn't do anything. The emergency room said it was a cyst. We went to the emergency room many more times and got the same thing told to us (I believe we went about 5 times total).

The pain suddenly got worse (though still in the same area and such), we went to the emergency room, again. Cyst again, but in a different spot. We went back to the OBGYN. She said she did not see anything but after much arguing agreed to do an exploratory surgery.

During the exploratory surgery they found out the girlfriend had [chronic appendicitis](http://www.symptomsofappendicitis.org/Symptoms-Of-Chronic-Appendicitis.html). This was misdiagnosed three times. It had been infected so long it had begun to attach itself to her lower intestine and the walls of her body. 

Luckily it was removed with no complications (that we know of). We figured this would end the persistent side pain and that had been the source all along, but we were wrong. About two-three weeks later the pain came back again. We went to the OBGYN who said she didn't see anything else that could be wrong during the exploratory surgery.

Shortly after my girlfriend lost her insurance because she got a better job, but her new job did not provide benefits so she was unable to find a new doctor. However, her and I are now making enough money we have applied for private insurance for her, so when it kicks in we want to be able to find a doctor that can help with this. No one seems to be able to figure out whats wrong.

** *** This OBGYN was a health department doctor and they did not have the equipment to do anything more than a regular exam.**

A few things:

* Her periods are irregular. We have tried various forms of birth control and the depo shot seems to be best for her and it makes her ""more"" regular, but not completely. 
* Her ethnic background is half Native American and half Caucasian. 
* Her mother has polyovarian cystic syndrome, but we cannot ger more details because her mom is who knows where.
* Doctors have said it is not endometriosis
* Doctors have said it is not polyovarian cystic syndrome
* One of the trips to the emergency room revealed she had pelvic inflammatory disease. It was treated and went away, but this was missed (or just started happening) the first two times we went to the emergency room and the first two times at the OBGYN.
* She is 21 years old.

So, tl;dr on symptoms:

* Stomach pain in lower right quadrant
* Doctors do not know what it is
* Lots of swelling occurs
* Cervix hurts often.
* Sex makes it worse
* Supposedly not polyovarian cystic syndrome or endometriosis
* Her mother has polyovarian cystic syndrome
* Once had chronic appendicitis

If anyone has any ideas, we'd really appreciate it, even if your ideas are one of the ones the doctors said it is not, because doctors can be wrong. :(",83,35,2011-01-01,PHARMA,0.326513409614563,0.6406429409980774,0.03284361958503723

Health,Sprained upper arm shoulder for 5 months now does not heal. (re-sprained) help!,"Dear reddit, 
I am in need of help. I sprained my upper arm/shoulder during the summer and went to physical therapy it was supposed to heal in 6 weeks but I have been going for 4 months and while it has still been hurting I have seen huge improvements. However last night a lot of shit happened (problems at home) where I punched the wall and all the pain that I had came back. 

So it seems as I have re-sprained my arm again. My physical therapist was already unhappy with how slowly I was healing and told me to do everything to no re-sprain it.

I need you help r/health 
Does anyone have any knowledge on this? I am afraid I will never heal normally again.

Health,Anyone else noticed that there are different ways to breathe and the way you breathe affects your 'psyche'?,"Lately I've been noticing that there are at least two ways to breathe. The way I usually do it is by using my abdomen to--in a way--pull air into my lungs. During a long car ride over the weekend I noticed I can also consciously choose to breathe by 'pushing' my chest out instead of my abdomen.

Maybe this isn't a huge realization to anyone else, but it seems like there are a lot of advantages to breathing from the chest. Namely, I feel like my body is more energized because I get fuller breaths and I don't know for sure but it feels like my body knows it needs more energy (the act of pushing your chest out is harder than pushing your abdomen). Also, I get more oxygen obviously so I can think a bit clearer.

So far I have only been doing this when I remember to, but it's getting to be more of a habit. I feel like it makes it easier to hold my head and neck with good posture, and of course pushes my chest out. It seems to also clear my throat and allow for a deeper voice with a nice timbre.

I can't help but think this is the correct way to be breathing, at least when not relaxing. Has anyone else noticed this, and if you're a person who breathes using your abdomen, try using your chest instead for like 2-3 minutes and tell me what you think.",25,32,2011-01-02,PHARMA,0.029236339032649994,0.9274800419807434,0.04328363016247749
Health,"I'm broke, I have no insurance, and my teeth have always been terrible.  Incredible pain.","I'm only 19 years old.  I've had awful teeth for as long as I can remember.  I have had multiple cavities for years now, ever since I was young.  I also have two molars that have split in the middle.  My two front teeth were smashed beyond recognition in an accident years and years ago.  I now have false ones made out of a bonding agent, but they're horribly stained and there's noticeable decay.

I lack any confidence to smile, I try not to laugh, I get near tears just thinking about how awful the condition of my teeth are in.  I've tried to take care of them, it's just that my childhood years have made it really hard to fix.

Seven months ago, one of my front teeth (tooth 8) abscessed and it was the most painful experience of my life.  I had a root canal done and a payment plan setup, which my parents paid for.  Now, I fear that my other front tooth is abscessing as well since I'm starting to feel that unbearably memorable pain again.  I used a mirror and saw there was a spot of decay between that tooth and the adjacent tooth, which I think has infected the pulp.

I can't afford a dentist but this is becoming a danger to my health.  I have been told an abscess could travel to my brain and actually kill me.",57,32,2011-01-02,PHARMA,0.11693409830331802,0.8528022170066833,0.030263712629675865

Health,I've Been Mouth-Breathing While Asleep For Years. How Can I Stop This?,"20/M For as long as I can remember (at least 4 or 5 years), I've been waking up every morning with a dry mouth and throat because I breathe through my mouth at night. It's extremely annoying to wake up this way, and I keep a bottle of water on my nightstand because of it.

During the day, I breathe through my nose (usually just one nostril for some reason) quite easily, but I sometimes catch myself mouth-breathing while doing various things (like browsing Reddit or driving or sitting in class, for example) and switch back to my nose. I've tried taping my mouth shut before bed, but it's no use. I apparently take the tape off in my sleep. I've heard of chin straps sold at drug stores that keep the mouth closed for sleeping. Has anyone used one of these? What else can I try before seeing a doctor? I've never seen an allergist, and I haven't had my tonsils removed (from what I've read online, this can be related). So...what is the first step to breathing normally?

EDIT: Forgot to mention that I think this might be the reason why I'm so tired all the time. Thoughts?

It was Salmon and rice... Iv also had sharp stomach pains on and off , pretty loose bowel movements, abdomen discomfort, general sick as shit feeling ever since... I went to emergency yesterday because I cant really function with this chronic stomach pains, not to mention I have lost 10 pounds over the holidays... I was in and out in 6 minutes, the doctor really could not care less, and basically kept making me say that it was my throat that hurt and not my stomach before diagnosing me with anxierty, and telling me the best he could do was for me to get it worked through with a GI...

Health,I need Reddit's help. I will be sitting on a bus for the next week with a case of mild hemorrhoids.  Advice?,"That's the tl;dr. Also, if this is the wrong place for this, please point me in the right direction.. I thought about AskReddit, but figured it'd get buried in there under all the deep questions there.

Whole story: I'm a member of a fairly prestigious college jazz band, and every year we go on a tour for this last week of our Christmas break of high schools and a few performance halls. This entails getting on a bus, riding for a few hours, performing, eating, getting back on the bus, performing, etc. You get the drill.

Over the past few days I have developed (despite my best efforts to avoid) mild hemorrhoid irritation. Not your extremely painful, bleeding from the ass hemorrhoids, but your annoying ""I can't sit still for very long, god this itches why won't it stop itching"" variety.
I've been doing the sitz baths and taking ibuprofen, which helps considerably, but the only chance I'll get for a sitz bath while on tour will be at night, in a hotel room with 3 other guys who will probably wonder why I'm taking a beauty bath or something.

We leave tomorrow morning and I'm looking for some advice on what's the best way to survive this week.

I'm 28 (soon to be 29 in feb) male, 6""2 405 pounds. Thankfully where I’m so tall i don't look that big but i am.

My friend is helping me out by walking with me in the mornings (starting tomorrow) so I’m hoping that'll help with my weight a bit (and maybe my depression)

What the real issue is, i've started looking at my birthday as ""just another year closer to dying"". I've ""accepted"" the fact i'm going to die young because of my weight and i often (especially around my birthday) get so depressed i often lose the will to even move and will sit in one spot for hours, just breathing not even thinking or moving just sitting there staring into nothing.

I have no insurance, and probably won't for some time since i'm still in school (got one degree, trying to get my second from a tech school) and i'm working two part time jobs (which i do like for the most part). I'm just wondering if there's anything you can suggest i try doing to at least elevate my mood or to do something that can help.

Health,People always assume they are in a large group with a big insurance company so the risks are spread out a lot but insurance companies keep all their groups tiny to maximize the chance that they can discontinue coverage to the group when someone gets sick in the group.,"small subdivided Group health insurance in big health insurance companies is a scam that allows insurance companies to increase rates until only the unhealthy remain in that particular ""group"" then the premiums become unaffordable for them too and the ""group"" gets closed out.

They can have as many different ""groups"" as they want and they can be tiny like say with only 200 people.

Meanwhile the insurance company sells new policies in other ""groups"" while people are healthy in a new ""group"" until people in that group also begin to get sick. Then everyone healthy from that group withdraws when someone gets sick and the premiums go up leaving only the sick person who can no longer afford the huge premiums in their ""group"" leaving them uninsured when they are sick.

And new pre or existing conditions regulation legislation will not help because the healthy people CHOOSE to withdraw from the group for a cheaper group as the one sick person's costs make their group policies more expensive so the company isn't forcing them out legally.

It's just another way insurance companies can get your money when you are healthy and then make it impossible for you to collect on your insurance when you get sick.

Health,HPV: what do I need to know as a male?,"My girlfriend thinks she might have HPV.  We won't know for sure until she sees the doctor again, but this sort of got me thinking.  What do I need to know about this as a male?  Before me, she has had multiple partners and never used condoms.  She is my first sexual partner and we have never had sex without a condom.  

What does this mean for me?  From what I understand, HPV is fairly common, but it still seems like something to avoid if possible.  Obviously a doctor is probably the best person to talk to about this, but I'm just looking for a basic rundown of info first.  I guess my main questions are:  How concerned do I need to be about this?  What possible consequences am I looking at if we continue to have sex (with or without condoms)?  Is HPV curable or does it stay with you for life?

I know that HPV is a lot worse for women than it is for men, but assuming that my gf's doctor does what is right for her, I'm just trying to figure out what is best for both myself and my relationship with my girlfriend.

Health,i performed the Heimlich maneuver on my father tonight.. PLEASE learn this.,"My father and mother were eating dinner on the dinning room table while I was getting a bottle of water.

My father started to cough and throw up little.... i gave him my bottle of water, thinking he just needed to clear his throat, not realizing his was choking.

He wasn't coughing anymore or breathing... he stood up walking over to the kitchen, while my mother was hitting his back... She started yelling when he began to turn blue.

I smacked his back as hard as I could 4 times then proceeded to do the heimlich maneuver

Made a fist just above his belly button, wrapped my other arm around him, then thrust up.
during the whole process i was yelling at my brother to stop looking and to dial 911.

after 5 attempts my father finally coughed up the food..
my brother told the lady from 911 that he was breathing and able to talk.
They sent paramedics over anyways. When they arrived they checked his breathing... the paramedic told my father that he came ""real close"" to dying.

My father started laughing and joked around saying 
""from now on I'm just gonna eat oatmeal""

He walked over and gave me a hug and a kiss.
still a little freaked out... I kneeled down did the sign of the cross and prayed.

Learn the Heimlich Maneuver, im so glad we had that health class in high school and for those posters in restaurants.

I decided to buy a 1 dosage generic yeast infection application. The next day my vagina was swollen, burned, and felt like the skin was going to just come off at any minute. I did some googling and found out this was a fairly common side effect of using the 1 dosage applications. 
Yesterday The swelling went down but in place came a weird red cloudy urine, and my bm consisted of some blood and very little poo pebbles. 
For the past three days I've been able to feel my heart beat in my vagina, and I've had shock like pains running up and down my vagina and what I'm assuming is my cervix. 

Today I started my period, and have horrendous cramping all over my lower abdomen (which is probably from my menstrual cycle), I've been extremely nauseated, had diarrhea, and now my kidneys(?) are hurting. I'm not sure if it's my kidneys but it's not my back or muscles it's just a deep pain below my ribs and above my ass and all I can think is that it's kidneys. 

I am always sick, or hurting, so I rarely go to the doctor, but this is intense. I've spent most of the morning in the bathroom. It hurts to sit, it hurts to lay down. I've tried taking Tylenol and it has done nothing to curve the pain. 

Do you think this is just two separate things (the side effects of the yeast infection treatment, and my period) or do you think it's something more serious?

Health,"Women of Reddit : Vulvodynia - My experience, and advice.","Vulvodynia was explained to me like this ""Vulvodynia is a word like headache, meaning pain in the head. Vulvodynia - Pain in the vulva.""

Simple enough?
I wrote this because I was told it was actually quite common.
The first half is what I went through to get my diagnosis, the second my advice to sufferers or people curious.
I live in the UK, and am now 19.

**My Story:**
I had no idea what I had until I was 17 years of age, but I had noticed the pain since I was 13,or perhaps more accurately when I first started experimenting with masturbation and penetration.

Over time I noticed I wasn't getting this ""joy"" or ""immense satisfaction"" that people had talked about, I was just getting pain .I'd read about the Hymen breaking and it being painful so at first I just blamed it on that.

Yet it didn't go away, there were times when it flared up so badly that it hurt to sit down.
Things continued and I'd try not to masturbate for weeks and months but when I did try again it would still be extremely painful.
By now I was starting to get really worried, I went through the phase of ""Why aren't I normal?"" and cry myself to sleep. Things only got worse when I met my first partner, sex wasn't at all fun or enjoyable it was just painful.

I know I should've gone to the doctors much sooner , and I regret not doing so. Yet even they didn't want to hear about it.



First Appointment - I said perhaps I had a cut inside my vagina , or a tear. The doctor had a look ""looks a bit red"" while I howled in pain. So they prescribed a tube of Vagisil, which of course did nothing.

Second Appointment - I said pain, they said STDs. I had every check they could do, all came back negative. Another tube of Vagisil.

Third Appointment - More STD checks, try different positions? They tried telling me it was all in my head. Nerves perhaps? Knicker material? Another tube of vagisil.



By this point, I was telling boyfriends that I don't like sex, or oral because I generally hated that area of my body for the pain it caused me.I couldn't wear tampons, so I never made that step away from sanitary towels that every girl seems to do. It made me scared, would I ever be normal? Would it effect my fertility? Would I ever have enjoyable sex? So many questions buzzed through me.

I decided enough was enough, and stormed down the doctors almost in tears. I just wanted an answer, I hated feeling like ""Mystery Vagina Girl"".

Thats when, hallelujah the nurse said ""I'll book you an appointment at the Hospitals Sexual Health Clinic"".
2 minutes, 2 MINUTES and a prod with a long cotton bud and I was diagnosed.

The diagnosis alone has made me more confident in myself, I am in a 6-month and going strong relationship and we have fantastic sex. I can only do very basic positions, and I have to be very well self-lubricated but it works. It was nice to be able to talk to my partner so I can say stop and he understands and doesn't take offense.

They offered me ""cures"" none of which are proven to work, I didn't go for them but I highly recommend you to try them out if you feel it could benefit you.

**What it is &amp; My Advice:**
There is a great place you can go for advice, to communicate with other sufferes and to find out what you can do. It's called the National Vulvodynia Association (NVA) and although it's US-based it's a fantastic website with up to date information.

A quote from the NVA
""Vulvodynia, simply put, is chronic vulvar pain without an identifiable cause. The location, constancy and severity of the pain vary among sufferers. Some women experience pain in only one area of the vulva, while others experience pain in multiple areas. The most commonly reported symptom is burning, but women’s descriptions of the pain vary. One woman reported her pain felt like “acid being poured on my skin,” while another described it as “constant knife-like pain.”""

If you look at your vagina in a mirror, imagine the entrance like a clock face. The pain is usually centralised from 9 - 3 , however im more of a 8 - 4 girl ;).

The nurse who examined me in the Hospital asked if I was ever abused as a child, which I wasn't but she seemed to associate the two.

There is no ""known"" cause, there are theorys but no facts.
There is no ""known"" cure, things work for different people. They offered acupuncture, anti-depressants , herbal remedys and even surgery. 

I turned them down. The thing that seems to work for me , is Femfresh. Its a brand of feminine hygiene products that helps to clean and balance the Ph of the vagina.

My main piece of advice is:
DON'T SUFFER IN SILENCE - please.
If your doctor just fobs you off with a tube of Vagisil (I now have enough to swim in) then put your foot down until you are happy.

Don't ever think you are abnormal, I was also told this is very common and am glad that I am not alone.

I hope this has helped someone, or at least shed some light on the problem.

I figured this was more health than an IAMA, but please tell me if im wrong as this is my first detailed post.

**TL;DR Vulvodynia, like headache but in the Vulva.**

Health,Has anyone wondered how long it would take to lose weight? I wrote a (highly accurate) program that tells you.,"Here you go: [Time to Lose Weight Calculator](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B74wLIzTSqmeY2UwYWE0ZTUtY2ExZC00OGNjLTllMjItOTk1NDViYjFiYTUz&amp;export=download&amp;hl=en).

Some warnings/information:

* This does NOT factor in everyone's starvation threshhold. I therefore advise against entering daily caloric levels below 1200/1400 for women/men respectively.

* I am a novice programmer, but none the less have confidence in my mathematical model. I have compared my results to some of the more popular websites. My program's ""time"" predictions are generally longer than the more popular websites. This agrees with my hypothesis that most websites use constant rates of change of weight, rather than rates *proportional* to your *current* weight. 

* This uses the command prompt. No fancy schamcy buttons to click.

Some background info:     
A while ago I was looking for some website or resource I could use to predict how long it would take to lose some weight. To my surprise, I wasn't able to find anything acceptably accurate.

Most websites seemed to calculate it using very basic algebra. Those sites that did seem to offer accurate estimations, offered their information in very restrictive formats. In general, I thought there was a need for something a little more useful.

So, I took all of the generally accepted knowledge on the subject I could find (Harris Benedict constant, BMR, activity level scalars, gender/age/height modifiers, etc), and modeled a differential equation for daily weight loss over time. I then wrote up a very basic interface, and shared it with reddit!      

Anyway, I hope someone gets some use out of this.

Health,"Weird feeling in my head, can't tell if psychological or physiological, help? (or at least help me properly define it.)","For most of the day, I have this mild unsettled feeling of stress/anxiety, and it seems to like to make me feel anxious about things, when normally I'm not. It's as if there's a valve for stress/anxiety that is always slowly leaking, and and when exposed to  stimuli it reacts. This is why I sometimes feel it's more physiological than psychological, because the feelings trigger the thoughts.


It gets a little worse when trying to sleep, because at first I'm really cold and shiver, and then after a while, my armpits and back of my neck are hotter than usual. After the initial trying to sleep though, I sleep fairly well(no nightmares, wake up fine, etc.)


What leads me to thinking it being psychological is that a few weeks earlier I read about the entire bird falling thing. I know it's a little stupid to believe, but since I was a kid, the entire end of the world deal was one of the few things that scared me. gradually, I got over it, but something about the bird case brought the scare back. that night I couldn't sleep, had high blood pressure, shivering, and feeling of slight pressure in my head. A week or so past after that normally, until this anxiety thing popped back up.


A few things that may or may not help:
-Usually when I wake up, I can't feel my hands and then I have to move them for the feeling to go back.(something to do with pressure, weak nerves or something)
-I usually go to sleep 12 -2 am (which isn't good I know)
-147 lbs, 5'4"" or so, male.


Could any of you guys guess what I can do to get myself better? or maybe even help me phrase myself better so when I do talk to doctors, I can get an accurate description of what I'm feeling?

Observing physique type and age doest help narrow the possibilities as it occurs in skinny/large and young/old woman. On average, women are 45+ and heavier. I’ve searched the web tirelessly never finding results. Is it a disease, diet, hygiene or condition????? If you have any idea, PLEASE help me solve this 25 year old mystery.

Health,Why do have an insane appetite?,"Hey reddit. I am 20 and have depression, and I've always had a larger than normal appetite, mostly for carbs. The depression seems to be related to exercise, as it gets better when I run/walk. When the depression gets better, so does the hunger. 

For the past few months, I've been following a paleo diet almost perfectly. I've been slacking on the running though, and the depression has gotten worse over the past few days, along with fatigue and hunger. 

The appetite does not go away after I eat, which is the very strange part. No matter how much I eat, I want more right when I'm done. The stomach pain is usually what stops me from continuing, even though the hunger persists. 

I woke up at 7:30 and it is now 5 PM, and here is what I've eaten so far today, in order:

* Three turkey burgers
* Two eggs
* Three potatoes
* Bowl of oatmeal
* Two bowls of brown rice
* Five bananas
* Half pound of baby carrots
* Two more bananas
* Mounds candy bar
* Small bag of Lay's chips
* Payday candy bar

Does anyone know any explanations that could help me, such as a link between exercise and decreased appetite? I've started Couch to 5k, which should hopefully help the depression and appetite, but I'm curious if anyone has any other ideas.

I avoid all dairy products except for the cheese, and if there is any dairy I always take Lactaid pills, but it doesn't stop the IBS.  Shit (haha), it's so damn sensitive that if I start to worry about having GI issues it causes GI issues... catch 22.  Either my stomach always hurts, or I'm embarrassingly gassy, or I'm spending my free time on the toilette.  I am also extremely in love with my SO and thus would be happily to bone him 2-3x a day, but my stomach wont let me and it's now ""hit or miss"" when I see him, max only 3x a week, on average once-twice.

My Dr suggested increasing the fiber in my diet.  That's great in all, but it doesn't address the pressure and flatulence.  

Does anybody have any advice to help with my problem?  I did a lot of research online, and at one point I read a statistic that some 70% of people with IBS have considered suicide and some point... and I understand why.  I cannot bare dealing with these problems anymore.  I WANT A STOMECHTOMY!",32,3,2011-01-30,PHARMA,0.06653466075658798,0.901465892791748,0.03199945390224457
Health,Been reading about what the doctor diagnosed me with. I don't know if I believe him or not. He diagnosed me with ulcerative colitis.,"So I took omne prazole (have had heart burn for the past 5 years or so) for a few weeks. One of the side effects was diarrhea like symptoms. So I thought nothing of it when I started having it. But it kept getting more severe where I was getting blood in my stools so I quit. Kept happening for a month before I went to the hospital. I ended up with a $1000 visit. Then they had me get a colonoscopy which was another $2000. I don't have any money so I am applying for medicaid naturally. The doctor said I have ulcerative colitis (which I took Accutane about 7 years ago, past the statute of limitations for lawsuit). I have the abdominal cramping, bloody stools, and diarrhea. Yet, I also have been passing undigested food. Ulcerative colitis affects the colon, not the digestive functioning from my understanding. Why would I be passing undigested food? Also, why would me taking omne prazole trigger this?

Any help from medical gurus would be appreciated :)",27,3,2011-01-30,PHARMA,0.08516538143157959,0.8877612352371216,0.027073314413428307

Health,Poop is ruining my life...please help.,"I need help. Since I was a child I've always had diarrhea issues. I can remember being nervous every single day of school, from 4th grade until graduation, that I'd have stomach cramps at school. It didn't help that I was afraid to use the public toilets at the time.

For me there is rarely ever a situation where if I have to use the bathroom, I just feel that normal pressure you feel when you have solid stool. It's like that every now and then, but it's so rare that it usually results in me celebrating. For me it's almost always diarrhea cramps, day-in, day-out.

To make matters worse, I feel strong rectal discomfort after using the bathroom. Not like a burning, but like a strong feelings of rawness. It's difficult to describe (And despite having loose stool, still taking 20 minutes waiting for different ""waves"" of shit. If I were to poop and immediately get off the toilet, I know that I'd just have to go back in five or ten minutes, so I poop, then I patiently wait for a few minutes, before the second wave comes.)

It's routine for me to use the bathroom and immediately  lie down and cover up in bed. It creates both a physical and a psychological discomfort that takes anywhere from 10-30 minutes to go away. On the rare occasion I have solid stool, I can easily and quickly clean up and I'm back on my feet. No discomfort. It's amazing.

I've tried increasing my fiber the last few weeks, and while it's better than it's ever been for me, it's still not improved completely (I'm having about 28-32 grams of fiber every day. I eat a fiber bar and take two fiber tablets daily.)

I'll usually have half a solid movement. It starts out solid and easy, but by the end it's loose again. Sometimes I'll spend a day with solid stool, then several days of loose stool again.

I'm having trouble figuring out if I'm just not eating enough fiber, or if there's something wrong with my system. Maybe I have irritable bowel syndrome? Maybe hemorrhoids?

I don't know, but I'm hoping you guys might have an idea. This is interfering with my life. It's stopping me from getting a job, as I know I'll have to go to work, spend twenty minutes in the bathroom, then have thirty or more minutes of horrible discomfort, and probably won't be able to get clean.

**EDIT**: Just within the last week or so, thanks to the new Health Care Bill, I've been able to have insurance for the first time in six years. I'm in the process of finding a doctor, getting the money for the co-pay, and setting up an appointment.

I'm really scared of the doctor dismissing my complaints. I've heard so many horror stories about doctors not taking symptoms or complaints seriously, and things going untreated because of it. I also live in a very small town, where I feel the standards for being a successful doctor are significantly lower, which also worries me.",194,73,2011-01-31,PHARMA,0.11485298722982407,0.8512358069419861,0.033911194652318954
