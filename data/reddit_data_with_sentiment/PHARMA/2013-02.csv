1. When I eat something that isn't gluten-free.

2. Ejaculation. 

Why would this be? No, I am not furiously doing that crap every day, I had cut it out long, long ago after I had started school along with starting a healthy diet and exercise. But I still am subject to nocturnal emissions every now and then, about once or twice a month. And I wake up and spend the entirety of the morning in SEVERE joint pain. My doctor had no idea what was doing it. I have no idea what's doing it. I thought it might be my thyroid, but I've been on 50 mcg Levothyroxine since August of this year, and my results were in the normal range last we had checked, so we're not sure about that. I had thought it was nerve issues, but I'm not sure about that. I also thought it was rheumatoid, but I still don't know. It's SO frustrating. We thought it was Fibromyalgia but the rheumatoid doc debunked that one.

But I want some sort of answer, I'm frustrated, and this is kinda something I need if I want a family later in life. I don't want to have to be eating only certain foods while being terrified of sex or anything that has to do with it because I know that nothing but severe pain waits.

pharmacy,Working at a retail pharmacy vs compounding pharmacy,"I work at a doctor's office and call a lot of meds into various pharmacies. I've noticed that pharmacists at compounding pharmacies are really badass.. very knowledgeable, chill, and helpful. A lot of the CVS/Walgreens type of pharmacists just sound overworked and edgy on the phone. I'm curious about the differences between pharm school grads who end up at a retail pharmacy vs those who create testosterone cream pens at a compounding pharmacy. Is there a big difference in the desirability or competitiveness of one vs the other, and how different are the educational requirement and training?

Also, I want to let you pharmacists/pre-pharm students know that I think you guys are great and totally underutilized! I hope to see that change in the coming years.",24,26,2013-02-01,PHARMA,0.023791667073965073,0.9315962791442871,0.04461206868290901

Health,Ask Reddit Health: [Constipation] What can I do to liquify the stool that has already made it to the large intestine?,"I had constipation a week ago which caused minimal bleeding and some pain. Then throughout the week I had ""untimely excretions"" which were harder than usual and caused mild pain.

Today morning I had proper constipation again with lot of bleeding and lot of pain. It still hurts. I am really scared to go to the toilet tomorrow morning, because the dinner I had last night (24 hours ago now) is already at the end of the small intestine or the beginning of large intestine and no treatment can change that now. How do I turn this stool softer...I just can't handle solid or even remotely solid stool tomorrow. 

I have consumed 15ml liquid paraffin and 5ml of castor oil. But I know that these will only act on the food I ate today and will leave yesterday night's dinner sitting inside unharmed...WHAT DO I DO!!!

Health,Dishonest Straw-Man Argument By Coca-Cola Defending Their Product.,"[First, we have this article from the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/opinion/when-jim-crow-drank-coke.html?_r=0). It's a simple, balanced, historical piece on race &amp; soda (and short!)

[Then Coca-Cola decided to reply.](http://www.coca-colacompany.com/opinions/setting-the-record-straight-coke-racism-and-civil-rights)

And here's what their chief historian says: ""First off, Coca-Cola does not contain cocaine, and cocaine has never been an added ingredient for Coca-Cola."", his first retort against the NYT Article. However, the NYT never said that Coca-Cola was ADDING cocaine to their drink; just that it contained it, [which is historically accurate.](http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/cocaine.asp) 

So we have a Straw-Man argument. He pretends like the NYT is claiming something they don't, and then he denies it. This denial is still pretty much a lie, but not exactly. Coca-Cola wasn't adding cocaine; they were just adding coca leafs, which happened to contain cocaine, right!?! But fuck that, because they added coca primarily for the cocaine initially.

Health,Weird amount of discharge? [Somewhat NSFW],"Okay so this is the second time I've had this problem. 

About 2 months ago in between my periods I had an abnormal amount of discharge. There was a lot of it - really thick and clumpy - and it smelled terrible. There was so much that my boyfriend would point out that I had ""white stuff"" down there and when we'd have sex there would be huge clumps of it on the condom.

When I got my period it went away, and since then I've had my period twice, but now it's come back. When I put my undies on in the morning, I'll touch down there after just a few hours and I can see clumps of it on my fingers.

I've searched around for similar things to this and so far I haven't found anything that fits my description. It's not a yeast infection, because it's not painful or itchy or anything. It's just abnormally thick and clumpy and it has a terrible smell.

Some help would be lovely. I talked to my mum about it but that was just before it went away last time so nothing came of it.

Health,Trying to help a friend with UTI and no insurance. Help is very much needed!,"Title pretty much says it all. I listed her symptoms below.

1. Dysuria (painful and difficult urination)
2. Urge to urinate frequently
3. Pain in the lower abdomen and genital region
4. Fever and chills
5. Bloating
6. Lack of bowel movements.

She doesn't have insurance and it being a Sunday all free clinics are closed. Also because of her lack of insurance she doesn't want to go to the hospital since that would end up costing a fortune out of pocket. I'm a nursing student and have also had a UTI before so I know how much having a UTI sucks.

Does anyone have any suggestions or home remedies to recommend? I dealt with my own UTI with a prescription of antibiotics so I don't know much. I've already suggested that she drink a lot of cranberry juice and water which my doctor suggested I do a long with the antibiotic treatment.

I really want to take her to some sort of doctor because I'm concerned her UTI isn't just a UTI since she also has a fever and chills. The lack of bowel movements also concerns me. Please someone help! I'm really worried about my friend. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!

[Update!!]

So I'm with her right now and she's a lot better. She's taking AZO and every hour I make her drink water. She told me that yesterday she was really dehydrated from drinking on Friday. So I think that the combination of the dehydration as well as the actual UTI made it flare up a lot worse initially (after all this was only the first day of her getting the UTI. She woke up at 5am from the discomfort from the UTI). Her fever and chills have completely subsided, she's eating well, drinking a lot of water and just resting. I'm staying with her for the rest of the day though so that if there is a flare up I can take her to the ER or the urgent care facility.

Thank you guys so so soooo much for all of the help. I have an urgent care facility address on hand now not only for her but also for any emergencies that may happen in the future. Once again I am so grateful for all of your responses. My friend is also really flattered and even more grateful.

I live in CT, so not sure if anyone else lives in the area that might know of a good way to beat this congestion.

Thanks!



Okay, I picked up a neti pot that came with premeasured packets and I also bought distilled water since I don't want to risk anything.  Now I just need to stop being a chicken.

If I wimp out, then I will go for the saline spray.  ;)


Edit: Okay, I tried the neti pot and is did help with the sinus headache that I had yesterday.  I still ended up congested as I went to bed and even tried it again to see if it would help and this time I stayed congested.   

So, I picked up Mucinex-D as well as Ocean Complete sinus rinse this morning.  Tried the sinus rinse so far and will probably have to take Mucinex-D later.

If none of these work, then I will have to suck it up and make an appt with my dr for the good stuff.

Thank you all for your help.  Together, we will defeat all congested sinuses!

Another other edit: So, I tried a humidifier over the weekend.  Been taking Mucinex D every morning.  Found my prescription for azelastine.  Also, have been taking super hot showers for the steam.  I'm feeling a lot better.  I'm thinking that it's related to allergies.  Thank you all again for the help.

I am currently a 3rd year medical student in a non-US medical school and am interested in doing some research in the field of cardiology. Upon approaching my professor, he tasked me the process of coming up with topics on which i could potentially work upon.

However, I am overwhelmed by the vastness of cardiology and my lack of knowledge in the field is making it hard to come up with anything worthwhile.

It would be great if someone could point me in the right direction or suggest some topics. Topics that include co-morbid conditions such as hypertension or diabetes would be ideal as the majority of patients we see have either d.m or htn or both.

Topics involving cutting edge topics or laboratory work would not be possible for me right now. However I would like to a topic that is novel is some ways..

Health,Can you bend your tailbone from sitting on your butt wrong too much?,"I've been noticing the last couple of weeks that my tailbone feels bruised, or that certain times when I sit down, if I sit a certain way, it feels like it's being bent, which is painful.

I know this isn't a hemorrhoid because I've had one of those before, there is pretty much NO comfortable way to sit on a hemorrhoid, this on the other hand depends on how I sit and how much pressure I put on my lower back/tailbone area.

I notice that with my old computer chair, which has virtually no padding left (I actually put towels on it to sit on now because otherwise it's too hard), it's constant pain with my tailbone, but on my newer balance ball chair (I have one at work and at home), as long as I sit so I'm evenly on the ball, and not too far forward, thus putting extra pressure on my tailbone area, that I seem to be mostly OK (but sometimes when I first sit down it feels like I'm sitting on a bruise).

I just checked now and the only time I feel a similar pain when not sitting is when I basically put finger on the tip of my tailbone and gently push, meaning it feels like the pain while sitting is caused by my tailbone being bent.

Is this something potentially serious that I should go see my doctor about, or just try to take it easy, hope that if there is a bruise that it will heal and i'll be fine eventually or what?

I've been using these ball chairs for at least 6-8 months now, maybe longer, though I've only been using the one at home for maybe 2-3 months, and was on that poorly padded chair for about 3 years (though the padding only really wore out completely after a couple years).

I also ride a bike to work every day, and that was never a problem but recently it is uncomfortable when I go over really big bumps so again, it's like applied pressure to the area causes the pain, but I have a desk job and am a night school student so I can't exactly stand all the time until this heals. I haven't had a chance to go see my doctor for various reasons (busy schedule, poor weather on days when I wanted to make the trip, etc) but I wanted to check in somewhere...",1,3,2013-02-09,PHARMA,0.07132726162672043,0.8988360166549683,0.02983672171831131

I'm at the end of med school and i'm currently in my emergency room rotation. Its all going really well and i like my choice of medicine as a study a lot. I plan to apply for a orthopaedic surgery residency after my PhD research in bone tumors is complete. However i noticed one weird and for me a bit scary thing.

Sometimes when i stitch up a patient my hands shake badly, i can still perform the procedure (closing after surgery/stitching wounds etc) but especially rotating the needle in the clamp is sometimes hard. I do get compliments for how the result looks, but it takes longer. Im not that trained in stitching yet, done it 25-35 times or so, so maybe it will improve with experience.

Cutting (with a blade), playing guitar, writing etc is not a problem, so i dont think i have an essential tremor/intention tremor. Its worse when lots of people are watching, so it may be anxiety. How did you deal with it, if you had this?

What can i do to reduce the tremors?

medicine,When is it too late to get back into medicine?,"I graduated from UK Medical school in 2002. I emigrated to the US right after graduation (so no house officer/intern year)

I had planned on doing the USMLE and practicing in the states. 

I took six months to revise for Step 1, however unbeknownst to me at the time, I was suffering from Graves disease. With anxiety attacks, inability to concentrate and my memory shot, I flunked the test. By. ONE. point. 

Although I signed up to retake, I never did, due to crippling anxiety attacks in the run up to the test. 

It took 5 years to be diagnosed with Graves, and another 3 before I can really say I felt better. 
I spent most of those years convincing myself I was incapable of passing the exams, that I didn't really want the responsibility of practicing medicine. But now I'm better, my dreams haunt me. I dream of being back in med school, of practicing medicine. 
I'm wondering if there is any chance at all of being able to get back into medicine. 

**TLDR:** I mean its been almost 11 years since I graduated. I always wanted to do family practice, which isn't all that competitive, but even so, even if I pass the USMLE, am I ever going to be accepted into a program, is there any point in trying?


*Extra information for the curious:* 
I emigrated for love, I met my husband right before I started Med school, we long distance dated all through as he encouraged me to get my eduation. We married in my final year. My elective was done in the USA (actually where we live now). The plan was to apply to a local program to do family practice, which was extremely FMG/local friendly. This would still be the case. 

I am not a complete idiot. But my family doctor was. I had no obvious signs of Graves, no goiter, no lid retraction, just a very fine tremor in my hands. She plied me with xanax for anxiety and propranolol for situation anxiety/tremor but never once did a blood test. I was too addled by the Graves to even realise this. Eventually I sought a second opinion for skyrocketing blood pressure and was diagnosed with thyroid crisis. 

My transcripts were excellent, although we don't get a GPA/graded degree in medicine in the UK, my individual grades were all mostly A's and B's and a few C's.

I know this is long, and I appreciate you reading this far, and any advice that you can give me.",15,10,2013-02-12,PHARMA,0.05196581780910492,0.9070725440979004,0.0409616120159626

medicine,"Dehumanization in medicine: causes, solutions, and functions","Do you think medicine can be dehumanizing? Where, when, why and how? Can these things be corrected or modified?

Haque, et al. describe several causes of dehumanization.

Non-functional causes:

1. **Deindividuating practices**: an individual becomes lost in a group, or otherwise anonymized. People are just ""a statistic,"" so to speak, or another number on a list. Both the dehumanizer and dehumanized can be deindividuated which, tragically, leads to the dehumanization of the dehumanizer (as is so often a theme with dehumanization in general).

2. **Impaired patient agency**: a focus on a patient's *lack of* ability increases the likelihood of animalistic dehumanization (discussed in further detail here: Haslam, N. Dehumanization: an integrative review. 2006. Pers Soc Psychopl Rev. 10:252-264)

3. **Dissimilarity**: this manifests itself in 3 ways between the physician (or healthcare professional) and the patient. These reinforce the ""us"" and ""them"" dynamic.

    a. Illness - by the very nature of being ill, patients fall short of the prototypical concept of ""human""
   
    b. Labeling - patients are often labeled by their illness rather than recognized as a human with an illness (e.g., ""Let's admit that bipolar patient,"" or ""There's a gangrenous foot down in the ED."")
    
    c. Power - there is an inherent power asymmetry present in the doctor-patient relationship

There are also functional causes of dehumanization:

1. **Mechanization**: the reductionistic perspective that patients are simply the sum of their parts. The authors cite this as necessary to some degree in the medical profession because it's useful to think, pathophysiologically, in this way about the human body. However, it can lead to objectification, in which others are viewed as incapable of emotional responsiveness or interpersonal warmth (or those things simply aren't dealt with). I might also add that this also leads to the dehumanization of the mechanizer, who becomes little more than a ""human mechanic"" and does not engage in true human relationships with their patients.

2. **Empathy reduction**: failing to consider the patient as a full social entity. There have been studies looking at the empathy (or lack thereof) of physicians which are cited in the paper. If one lacks empathy, you cannot perspective-take and this leads to other forms of dehumanization, both animalistic and mechanistic.

3. **Moral disengagement**: physicians often need to temporarily suspend themselves from their role in committing harm, which is related to empathy reduction. For example, cutting open someone's chest, giving a foul-tasting medicine, etc. are all causing some degree of harm, although we've determined that the benefits outweigh the risks if we're doing it (hopefully!). I don't think physicians honestly think that their patients are incapable of feeling joy, pain or desire, but I do think they frequently just ignore this part of what makes their patients human which in the end has a similar effect

The authors go on to discuss some solutions, but I'm also interested to hear your own.

This the specific article, talking about cyclists. A good read. http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130212-why-you-really-hate-cyclists/1

**TL;DR**: People become very angry at free riders who don't contribute to communal systems but reap disproportional benefits. 'Fair' contributors become so angry that they sacrifice their own resources to penalize free riders.

As US medicine becomes more centrally funded (taxes/mandated insurance) do you think this same anger towards free riders will be felt towards smokers, obese, etc being seen as not personally maintaining their health but reaping expensive benefits from public coffers? Will we see coverage changes come about as a result of this?

Health,Surgeries That Saved My Life and Changed It Forever,"I posted this earlier in a ask reddit post but this was the first time I actually took some time to put down some of my experiences into writing. I feel that because of this I should put this as its own post but it will probably be crushed under the content boot of reddit.

I was in the hospital to get my colon removed because I had a disease called ulcerative colitis that was unable to be controlled by heavy regiments of medicine, remikad, and the steroids. I bleed enough over the course of three months that I had to get around 27 units of blood.


 But this is not the single event that changed my life no it came after the initial surgery when the doctors realized that had I been an older or less strong person I would not have survived the surgery but also that I would not have made it over the next few months despite how healthy I was going into the surgeries. The doctors did what they could but they wanted to monitor me for a little longer just to be sure. Two days before I was to be released, to recover for a while with a colectomy bag, I started to vomit non-stop and feel an insane levels of pain. All of the sudden I had all sorts of hellish liquid pour out of my scar that spans from just above my genitals to just above my lower pecs and then my colectomy hole widened and more shit, acid and blood began pouring out. Imagine just laying there in bed and then all of this happening before your eyes that horror of seeing the staples holding your stomach together begin to pop out and your stomach begin to split open. Needless to say I have had many sleepless nights following this but my story is not over.


 I cannot emphasis how much I love and respect nurses for what they did for me throughout my stay in the hospital (52 days for this time but that year around 74 in total) but that night all nurses won the medal of honor from me. They came in and quickly did everything that they could and got me clean and together and got me as quickly as they could to the operation room. I can't recall exactly everything they did because I was given pain meds and my brain was a little overwhelmed but I do remember that I couldn't have dealt with that situation without them being there. 


I was quickly put under a heavy drug induced coma which led to me losing about 6 days of my life completely to the void of nothingness with brief periods of awareness before I was put under again (there is another freaky anestisa story there but I feel like this is too long already). My family and doctors did tell me what I went through when I was feeling a little better. I went through an additional 6 surgeries where two of the doctors broke down in tears in between (one of the doctors was my best friend since elementary schools Mom and the other one was a fairly young doctor under the big boss and I was her first real insane case) and at one point one doctor (while trying to be encouraging) told my parents that they had seen people survive when they were that bad (later we learned that there arn't many people who do though). What had happened was that my intestine walls had torn apart because they were so weak because of the massive amount of medicine I had to take trying to deal with my disease.

 I had built up a large amount of coagulated blood in my stomach (I forget what this is called but it apparently does not usually turn out well) that had to be removed. At the same time I was losing blood so rapidly that the doctors had to literally force blood into to keep up with my blood loss. For the doctors it was a grueling endeavor to simply keep me alive but somehow they did. Following this I spent (as I said earlier) 52 days in the hospital getting examined by all sorts of doctors (some would just check on me out of curiosity while seeing other patients). I got in total 48 units of blood which is the equivalent to around four humans worth of blood.


 I still have a colectomy bag and I am prepping for a further 3 surgeries that I will undergo this upcoming summer. 


This all happened to me when I was 19 years old but I did turn 20 in the hospital. My experiences with all of that and all of the stuff that filled my life for my remaining time in the hospital recovering and fighting would take up many more paragraphs worth of stories but to make a long story short I had to take diluadid every 2 hours, didn't eat for around 24 days, and had more needles and tubes shoved in me then I would ever want around me in my entire life.

 I am an US citizen so I was blessed that my parents were well off enough to be able to afford top line health insurance that got the appropriate means in place to save my life. I don't know what would have happen if I was in England or if I didn't have health insurance but my life would have been in the hands of the queue or in human mercy (o god neither of those is a good choice). [not trying to be political in any way just an observation I have had] I was an old soul going into the hospital but I came out a changed man in some ways a better man but in others I have gotten weaker (like drive and self-confidence). 


Btw b4 this experience I had been in the hospital only to see my baby siblings and I had only gotten a small cold or fever every few years but for the most part I was an extremely healthy individual who just crashed in an almost unheard of way. Being sick was not something I was used to.

medicine,PSA: Medical School Debt,"Pay off amount: $195,585.41

I just wanted to give everyone a view into how much a typical medical student debt would be these days (I think I read somewhere the average is $155k). I graduated in 2010 from a state medical school (read: in-state tuition), I only used public stafford loans (sub and unsub) to finance my education. During residency I used my 6 months deferment, paid IBR for 1.5 years. In my last year residency, I decided to go into forebearance due to some unforeseen expenses. I am now almost out of residency, and have a job lined up. I should be able to pay this off without to much heartache, but really I hate being in this much debt. I graduated college without any debt whatsoever. This is solely educational debt that I incurred throughout residency and medical school. I have no other consumer debt (I do have a mortgage though). For the most part, I think I've been fairly financially responsible, though I do see some things I could have improved upon (like pay more towards my debt during residency).

I guess my point is this: be sure this is what you want to do, especially if you have to finance your education. Otherwise you are going to be in a world of hurt in the future.

medicine,"Personal responsibility in medicine - for patients who refuse to diet, exercise, quit smoking etc should your reimbursements be held based on their poor outcomes.","I recently found myself in a situation where a patient in my clinic who carried a diagnosis of Type 2 DM (with peripheral neuropathy), HTN, morbid obesity (BMI 37.1), OSA and tobacco abuse came in to establish care.  I went through the normal series of questions, and gave my ""smoking is bad speech"" asked them to fax or call some blood glucose logs so I can adjust their insulin regimen accordingly when it suddenly dawned on me and I asked ""do you want to quit smoking?  Is there anything I can say or do to get you to quit?"" and they told me ""No.""  

For that matter they flat out told me that there was little they were going to do in terms of lifestyle modification including watching what they ate, exercising etc.    

From what I understand, a patient like this could seriously impact reimbursements in the future.   I typically go out of my way to be as positive and encouraging with my patients as possible.  I call the ones I know struggle at home weekly to make sure their diabetes is under control, or touch base to make sure they got to attend the water aerobic class we discussed.

Health,Considering self-treating severe IBS symptoms with marijuana.,"This is going to be a long post because I want to be thorough and include every detail that could effect the topic of conversation, which is if I should look into self-treatment of my IBS symptoms through marijuana use.

I'll just start by stating the symptoms that really bother me.  The first one is chronic diarrhea and excess of bowel movements.  I was typically having 3-5 'normal' bowel movements a day several years ago, but it has slowly progressed to having 6-10 a day on average these past 6 months.  It should be noted this is a ""normal"" day for me.  I typically have 3-5 lose or flat out liquid bowel movements before noon, with the first one having lots of volume/mass and then the preceding movements decreasing in volume/mass each time.  Then the rest of the day I have very small volume bowel movements sometimes mixed with gas or mucous (on the rare occasion blood/bloody mucous).  These movements later in the day are typically more compact than compared with the morning, but are also very skinny and notably smaller/more frequent.  I usually have little to no control over the bowel movements in the morning, once I get the feeling of having to go I have a very short window to make it to the washroom accompanied by severe pain if I try to hold it.  After the bowel movement is done I feel a relief of pressure but a dull pain (kind of like an aching or soreness) stays.  I usually have more control over the bowel movements later in the day and there is less of an immediate pressure/pain, but the soreness and aching still exists.  One thing that's new is I've been waking up in the middle of the night, either from having to rush to the washroom or just due to pain.  I also have episodes (2-3 days in duration usually) where day-to-day symptoms worsen and I'm pretty much bedriden.

What always accompanies the excess bowel movements is a constant fatigue or feeling of tiredness, it feels like my gut is just constantly draining energy from me.  In the mornings I can tell that my body is hungry, but I have little to no appetite.  Trying to force food down usually leads to nausea and occasionally vomitting.  So breakfasts typically are very small and plain and although I'm hungry I don't eat much until my appetite returns (usually an hour or two after the evacuation of my normal 3-5 morning bowel movements).

I've been in and out of the doctors office for the past year trying to find out how to alleviate symptoms I've been having for years now.  I was diagnosed with IBS last year by my doctor and have been trying different medications and treatments.  None of the medications work, or they're side-effects are as bad/worse as the symptoms (side-effects of diarrhea and fatigue to treat my diarrhea and fatigue, wonderful).  I've been told from multiple doctors that medications for IBS are hit or miss or that they simply don't work at all.  With my faith lost in medication I tried making lifestyle adjustments.  I've tried several different diets, limiting lactose and gluten, tried finding my ""trigger foods"" but the symptoms remain constant regardless of diet.  I still maintain a healthy diet though because I'm an athlete (and had good eating habbits prior to fooling around with my died) and because I assumed that a good diet can only help.  I've completely cut out all alcohol intake, limited my red meats, cut out junk food completley, my diet is basically chicken with a variety of carbs and vegtables and fruits and possibly eggs with breakfast if I ever have the appetite (rarely) with liquids limited to water or juices (limited my dairy intake as well).

I've found excercise and rest help a lot, but it requires a lot of rest.  If I sleep 10-12 hours a night AND nap 2-4 hours some point in the day I can limit my pain, I have more bowel movement control, and I'm pretty hungry the few hours I'm awake.  The thing is a schedule like this just isn't possible if I want to lead a normal life.  In the summers working a 9-5 job I'm completely exhausted afterwards and have to force myself to go to the gym.  Even getting 8-9 hours of solid sleep a night doesn't help.  I still feel fatigued and symptoms still occur at work.  After a week of work I spend most weekends in recovery mode, where I sleep 14-16 hours, wake up and eat, maybe go to the gym and then sit around.  During school it's even worse because it's very hard to fit in those 10 hours of sleep, let alone napping and exercise.  Plus the stress that comes with a heavy workload don't help much (last year in engineering degree).  Sleeping so much also throws off my sleep schedule.  If I spend an entire day or a couple of days recovering where I do almost nothing but sleep, it can be hard to get back to sleep and fit back into a class or work schedule.

I've booked a colonoscopy through my doctor (for Sept 2013) because I've also felt like it could possibly something other than IBS since my symptoms have been getting more severe and have been worsening at a quicker rate (ie each day-to-day symptoms deteriorating faster and each one of my most recent 'episodes' have been getting much worse).  The most recent one lasted 5 days and was right in the middle of some midterm exams.  I couldn't do much other than lie in my bed or on the couch and had to go to the ER eventually.  At this point I was having 15-20 diarrhea bowel movements a day, consistently with blood, and was extremely tired and lethargic.  They took some blood tests and put an IV in me because I was very dehydrated from the constant diarrhea (despite intake of lots of fluids).  They did a CT scan on my abdominen which came out normal so they didn't procede with a colonocopy.  So basically what it comes down to is that I either just have IBS, or that they missed something.  In a way I was hoping it was something else because I have exhausted my treatment and medication options with IBS, but I'm also glad it's for now, not more serious.

My girlfriends brother went through the same thing and was finally diagnosed with ulcerative colitis after refusing to leave the hospital until they did a scope.  He has since had some relief form anti-inflammatory steroids but might require surgery soon.

Now after a long introduction about me, onto the topic at hand.  I've been looking into treatment options and stumbled on some promising information about cannabis use in alleviating the symptoms of IBS and IBDs.  At first it was hard to find credible sources, with results being extremes on either side of the spectrum (pro vs against).  It seems to me like the treatment might only be minor pain relief combined with a placebo effect due to pot users wanting to believe that marijuana cures everything from the common cold to cancer (I actually read a post that stated the cure to cancer was ingesting a pound of oil made from marijuana).  But I'm optimistic and willing to try if it can help with a lot of my symptoms.  Like I said earlier I don't have many other options if it's just IBS, and if it's more than that the next step is anti-inflammatory steroids or surgery (both of which frigthen me).

The main thing's I'm looking to combat are my constant pain and bowel movements, my lack of appetite and my fatigue due to overactive bowels.  If it can do all that then it just might be my miracle drug.  I used to smoke pretty regularely in my teens but haven't in over four years.  I also worried about the other effects of the drug and how they'd effect my daily life.  I'd only smoke enough to alleviate symptoms and try not to get too high, but if the requried dosage to alleviate symptoms leaves me ripped out of my mind all day then it's not really a suitable answer for me.  I need to be mentally competent and productive during school, right now that's hard with the constant fatigue but if I'm blazed the entire time to the point where it's effecting my school work or mental efficiency, it's like trading one hell for another.  The main thing I want to acheive is just a normal work/school schedule.  I just want to be able to sleep 8-9 hours a day like everyone else, not have to nap or sit around too exhausted to think, not have to worry about forcing food in my face to the point I'm throwing it up, and not spending over half the day in bed and a quarter of the it on the toilet.",18,15,2013-02-26,PHARMA,0.17415529862046242,0.7937697172164917,0.032074954360723495
medicine,Can some more experienced practitioners give advice to a student? Dealing with sickness/death/etc...,"We've just started our clinical rotations recently and I'm really loving it.

I'm loving being in the hospital, learning on the job, the interaction with my colleagues, and most of all, chatting to patients. 

My very first clinical block has found me in a neurosurgical department. 

Getting to watch the surgery is fascinating and I feel like I'm learning so much about surgery in general, anaesthetics, intensive care, and the day-to-day way a hospital works.

Here's the thing I'm struggling with right now: some days it can be so emotionally heavy and draining and I'm not sure how to deal with it.

For example, talking to young patients with brain tumours, and seeing the very sick patients artificially ventilated in ITU is quite emotionally stressful for me right now. 

On the one hand, I feel very privileged that I'm joining a profession where I may potentially be in a position to help such people in my working career but sometimes I come home in the evening and feel completely emotionally wiped out.

The best way I can describe it is a feeling of heaviness.

Health,"I just cut my wife's medical bills in half, from $1800 to 900, just by asking!","So I read this article a few years back on the Consumerist about [picking up the phone and asking for a discount if you pay medical bills in full immediately](http://consumerist.com/2010/07/26/deflate-puffed-up-medical-bills-with-a-phone-call/). Fast forward a few years after reading the article and our son is born. The bills totaled up after insurance were a little over 1800 dollars. Of course the bills offered the easy ""pay online and save time!"" option, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to call and ask them if they could give me a bit of a discount if I paid in full. WOW, the total cost was cut in half!!! The biggest single reduction was the cost of the doctor who spent all of 10 minutes in the room ""catching"" my son as he was delivered. Her bill to the insurance was $4500, my responsibility was $400... When I called, they reduced the charge to 70 bucks! 

If you're ever hit with big medical bills, follow this advice... Don't just blindly send money, call and ask for a reduction!",1,9,2013-02-28,PHARMA,0.08071685582399368,0.8754407167434692,0.043842416256666183
