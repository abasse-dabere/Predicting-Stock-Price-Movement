pharmacy,I got some disturbing insight into priorities in a chain pharmacy today.,"I work for one of the big chains. One of the corporate gods has decided that the best way to cut expenses is to cut labor, so we're chronically understaffed. Their solution is for us to call a person from the front end (supposedly one cross-trained on basic pharmacy functions, but this is rarely the case) whenever it gets overwhelming. 

Today was overwhelming. When I asked management to send someone back they sent the cosmetics girl to us. She was helping for about 15 minutes when a shift lead came back and said Cos needed to go back to cosmetics since the corporate geniuses have mandated that the cosmetics department be staffed from X time to Y time during the holiday season - no exceptions for lunch breaks or helping out in other departments. 

I asked the shift lead what we were supposed to do as we were at the point of handing out 2 hour wait times. The shift lead (who is perfectly capable of working in the pharmacy if necessary) basically shrugged her shoulders and wished us luck. 

Cos girl saw the predicament we were in and stayed to help anyway. She left the cosmetics department unstaffed for 40 minutes, which meant customers would have to walk all of 5 feet over to the main register to check out for that time. In that time period, the pharmacy sold over 50 prescriptions - not record breaking, but a lot for my store to sell in an hour. 

When the store manager came back from her lunch break, she called the cosmetics girl into the office and chewed her out for being out of the cosmetics department for 40 minutes. She then came back to the pharmacy to stress the importance of having the cosmetics counter staffed during the corporate-mandated hours and basically chewed me out in front of the RXM and other tech, both whom had just come in, and the tech who'd been with me all day. She wasn't trying to hear me when I told her that the shift lead could have either stood at the cosmetics counter or helped in the pharmacy.

So I was basically told that having adequate help in the pharmacy during one of the busiest days of the month takes a backseat to having someone in cosmetics on the off chance one of the guys in suits comes in. And also just in case someone wants some cheap perfume out of the locked case, I guess.",41,57,2014-12-02,PHARMA,0.05453462898731232,0.9082143306732178,0.03725101053714752

medicine,PA student. Forgot lead for ortho surgery. Help ease my nerves,"So I'm 27yo male PA-S2 student on rotations.  Have been in my first or rotation for a week which Iis ortho trauma. Been good about wearing lead and all that.

However today I was between cases and got asked to assist in a room already in progress. I scrubbed in and ended up not being needed at the moment so I was standing 2-3 feet from the team/pt where they were putting a plate on a fibula fx. Radiology was in there using C-arm fluoroscopy to assist in placement.

i was in there maybe 30 minutes or a little longer. I'm guessing not more than 20 images were taken over that period but wasn't counting by any means.  I realized my mistake at that point and scrubbed out and left really frustrated with myself and of course now concerned about the exposure to the gonads (wife wants kids after school) and thyroid.

pharmacy,Convert pounds to kilograms in your head - halve the number and subtract 10% (x-post from r/fitness),"I can't believe I had never known this trick and it is very useful in the hospital. I'll paste the text below from user r/lexan

For example, take 274 pounds:
1) 274/2 is 137
2) 10% of 137 is 13.7, but since we just want an approximation, drop the 7 and subtract 13 from 137 -&gt; 137-13=124.
The actual result is 124.284 kg.
 
Another example - 182:
1) 182/2=91
2) Drop the 1 and subtract 9 -&gt; 91-9=82 kg.
Actual result = 82.5 kg
 
So halve the number, drop the last digit and subtract the remaining from the result.

pharmacy,"Not doing so well P2 year and worried I may have to retake a class, need some advice","I'm a pharmacy student who has made it to the P2 year without being set back at all. I started pharmacy school right out of high school, made it into the PharmD program at my first school on my first try, and made it through P1 year without any serious problems (got under a 3.0 semester GPA during my spring semester because I got a C in one class, they gave me a warning because of it). I am really worried this semester because there is a very good chance that I will get less than a ""C"" in one of my classes which means I have to wait a whole year to retake the class and it will delay my graduation. 


This has been stressing me out and I've been feeling extremely depressed and drained because of it and I just wanted to know if anyone else had to retake any classes or had their graduation delayed because of something similar. I feel embarrassed and ashamed and I'm not looking forward to having to tell my family that my degree will probably end up taking an extra year to finish. Not to mention, my class will know that I failed when they don't see me in the P3 classes this summer and next year which is even more embarrassing. 


This first semester of my P2 year I am likely going to get:

Pharmacokinetics: B

Pharmacology: B

Professional Practice Development: B

IPPE: A

Non-Pharm Elective: B+

Therapeutics: probably less than a C

No-one in the course is involved in clinical care, and the professor is from the philosophy dept. As is probably to be expected, I've never seen this discussion during any shadowing experience. 

Thus, I am curious how members of the medical community feel about the policies at their institutions. Thanks!",15,8,2014-12-06,PHARMA,0.03518989309668541,0.9294514656066895,0.03535870090126991

pharmacy,People's misconception of pharmacists,"So I was on r/offmychest
http://np.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2oi3e7/to_the_couple_buying_waiting_for_their_meds_at/

This thread was basically about how a girl was trying to buy plan B and was getting judge by other patients (NOT the pharmacist) from the pharmacy (that's not right! but that's another issue). But what also bothered me was people's misconception of pharmacists. Scrolling down the thread, it seems like a lot of people see pharmacists as the evil people who do not give them the drugs when needed. One guy even said
&gt;  I disagree, it's the prescribing doctor who is presumably a specialist's job to determine what's medically necessary for the person to be taking, not the pharmacist. The pharmacist's job is to help the patient with any questions they might have about the medication, not double checking if they have the disease/condition.
This wouldn't be seen as acceptable for any condition other than a mental disorder. Would you like a pharmacist questioning whether you really have AIDS and need your antiretrovirals?

How do you guys feel? Isn't it not our jobs to question whether the medication prescribed by the doctor is appropriate for the patient? It frustrates me that people look down on pharmacy saying that it's just a regular degree (like a BS in science) and that we should have no say in what the doctors prescribed.",60,24,2014-12-07,PHARMA,0.1158776581287384,0.8593998551368713,0.024722499772906303

medicine,"HOSPITAL STAFF: Questions regarding protocol of family visit allowances, supervision or lack thereof during said visits, and duty of staff regarding suspicion of abuse by family.","This topic likely sounds heavy, but let me dispel any concerns immediately: I'm writing a short piece of fiction for a contest, and I'm having trouble finding info on a few hospital protocols that will play into it. (I hope I'm in the right sub.)



Firstly, let's say a teenager is brought in for emergency treatment. She may have been beaten or poisoned or otherwise nearly fatally injured, and the call is reported by a stranger who happens upon the wounded teen.



1.) When the parents are called in, would the teen remain in the same ""emergency room"" to recover? In other words, if the parents visit, will they be visiting in the same hospital room in which the teen was treated, or would he/she be wheeled to another ""recovery room"" that would allow visitors? (I ask because the criteria of the contest stipulates that the action must take place in a hospital emergency room.)



2.) Is it feasible that the parents would be allowed to sit in the room together with their unconscious child, unsupervised, late at night? Assume this injury just occurred.



3.) Is it feasible that the teen would have a room to him/herself, or would there be several other recovering patients and hospital staff around? This is important because the piece will be driven by private and secretive dialogue between the parents in the room. Privacy is key.



4.) How long would the parents be able to remain visiting, alone, assuming they would be allowed at all?



5.) Let's say that in treating the teen, the doctor notices bruises or other potential signs of abuse at home. Would the parents then be allowed in? Would the doctor be bound to ask the parents (like you see in movies with school counselors), whether there is any abuse going on in the home? Would they be bound instead to notify police? (These questions likely seem silly, especially to someone in the know, but I'm building this story around a few things here.)

I've found out his rationale for giving it is to prevent the possible diarrhea from the antibiotics he's giving.

My first thought was this is potentially harmful, because any antibiotic induced colitis will be masked until the point when the c.difficile has proliferated enough to be severe.  After all, loperamide and any other anti-diarrheals are contraindicated if any colitis is suspected.

Second, I did a literature search to see if there's any evidence backing the use of any anti-diarrheals for prophylactic use and couldn't come up with anything.

I've talked to the doc about it but he wants to continue anyways.  I've begun talking patients out of getting it, unless they also have a pretty severe cough.

medicine,is there a contradiction at the core of medicine? we are here to further the state of our species through the protection of its weakest members [serious],"i'm not a social darwinist, nor am i generally a cynic.  i'm not a social conservative.  i am, however, an EM doc in a very rough part of the world.  

i love my job.  but it has occurred to me that i take young people who make very poor decisions and i put them back together so they can make more young people.  i fix middle-aged COPD exacerbations, so that they can go outside for a smoke.  i take old people and i help them live far beyond what might be considered useful lifespans.  this is not to say that from their perspective those extra years in the garden/smokes/children aren't worth it - of course they are.  it's that perhaps this decision rubric is perverted by the fact that we are there to catch them, always, for ""free"".

these are cherry-picked examples.  however, i think the phenomenon is scalable; we reward or at least ameliorate the consequences of poor medical adherence, diet, lifestyle, childrearing and budgeting choices every day.  we act as a distorting buffer between decisions and their consequences, which econ101 tells us is a bad idea.  i know that there are plenty of outside feedback mechanisms for bad decisionmaking and that people aren't widgets.  the question is as a doctor, am i now more part of the problem than the solution?

so what's the alternative?  people dying in the streets, medieval lifespans and the economies to go with it?  that's not really the question either.  we're far past that and i'm not arguing that doctors are net negatives for society over the arc of human history.

we know that the consequences of poor decisionmaking (if not simply poor luck) should rest squarely on the shoulders of the decisionmaker.  even our moments of altruism are, at the species level, self-interested.  but what we do is far beyond altruism and it may be taking our species' best intentions to the point of toxicity.  certainly the absurd economics of healthcare don't help.  but even in a world of perfect price transparency and appropriate financial signals to the patient, this medical overreach would exist.

this is not a rant against the poor and it's certainly not meant to question the value of medicine writ large.  it's an attempt to grapple with something strange at the foundation of my place in the world.",84,194,2014-12-15,PHARMA,0.071425661444664,0.9012406468391418,0.02733369916677475

medicine,So: fluoridation?,"My town in Alaska is embroiled in yet another ""should we fluoridate our water or not?"" debate.

The question is now one of economics, as our utility faces budget crunches and labor cutbacks. Some argue that .5% (or significantly less than 1%) of fluoridated water is ingested and thus the vast majority of fluoridated water goes down the drain for naught; better to not add it and save labor. Does this argument about the low percentage of ingested fluoridated water, er, hold water?

Also, we have little to no natural fluoridation; antiflouridators are pointing to communities with natural fluoridation that have stopped adding as a community to emulate, never mind the differences in the source of the water. We have dentists attesting to the vital role fluoride plays in dental health and during the formative years of young kids, but a lot of hysterical mothers who ""read it on the internet,"" etc it's all poison.

I obviously work with people with the whole range of conditions from a hoarse voice to terminal cancer, with stroke, Parkinson's and dementia along the way.

I read a lot of posts about people seeking answers to their medical conditions and a common suggestion seems to be to keep seeing doctors until someone comes up with a treatment plan to fix their condition.  This is the case even for things I understand as life-long conditions.

Do you find people's expectations are a barrier to them learning to live with their conditions?

Obviously there's nothing wrong with wanting to treat and control your condition as much as possible but I certainly see people with quite severe laryngopharyngeal reflux who wave away all the lifestyle advice I can give them in favour of going to see yet more doctors in the hope of finding a magic pill.  I also have people who have Parkinson's with poor speech who keep self-referring even though they do not continue doing the things they have been advised to do to maintain their speech.

pharmacy,Funny moment with Nurses and Coumadin today,"First off, i am just a Pharmacy Intern.

A lil back story: So I work for a company that fills prescriptions for dozens of nursing homes and elderly care facilities in the area.  It's an independent pharmacy.  At our pharmacy we process hundreds of orders a day and we fill prescriptions, IVs, etc all day.  One thing we do is prepare ""starter dose"" sheets.  Usually a pill card that has anywhere from 2-8 of a specific med so if a patient needs them they can have them and then write us a script for the rest after.  So like starter dose of 6 tramadol, then we send more that day.

Today: I was entering prescriptions on the computer and one comes in with the bar code pulled from a starter tab of 6 2mg Coumadin (which they used as T3T)  I look at the patient profile and I see that they had received a 30 day supply of 6mg Coumadin about 20 days ago.  So theoretically there is no reason they should have pulled a starter.  So I call the home and talked to a nurse and here is what she tells me (as close to verbatim as I can remember):

""Uhm so sometimes when we have a patient who has a large amount of a commonly used medication we will keep the card back in a bin so we can use it for other patients if they need it.  So the patients card was either used up or misplaced.""

So, needless to say, I was a bit like... wtf.  That's illegal lol.  Anyway, we apparently run into situations like that on a less than rare basis.  To me it is kind of concerning but i am sure the nurses are doing it out of some sort of beneficence and patient advocacy as opposed to intentionally breaking one of the simplest medical laws.


TL;DR: Nurses were giving one patients warfarin out to anyone else who needed it.  Probably wasn't just the one patient either.

Does this kinda stuff happen to other people?",13,18,2014-12-22,PHARMA,0.06666208803653717,0.9058032035827637,0.02753470465540886

medicine,"All natural remedy known to treat ""every known illness"" being marketed to Spanish-language audiences... wtf?","My Spanish is just okay, but I was flipping through channels and a commercial caught my eye when this ""medication"" claimed to treat ""every known illness"" from diabetes to arthritis to Alzheimer's. This commercial seriously infuriated me.

In medical school, we were specifically taught that Latin-American patients tend to put a disproportionate amount of trust in home remedies/supplements. Well... products like this (link below) blatantly lie to audiences (fake doctor in the commercial and everything) and seem to have free reign in what they say on Spanish language networks. For somebody without medical expertise, hearing a ""doctor"" recommend this product, I can understand how it could be easy to confuse this with a real treatment.

Just in my experience alone, products like this cause immeasurable harm... Patients substitute real medications for these supplements, and it seems that Spanish language television networks are not being held accountable for what is said. The regulations regarding English-language supplements are actually very interesting (for example, you can claim to treat symptoms but not specific diseases), and while that's a separate debate, there is at least some oversight regarding medical claims. I assumed the same rules applied in Spanish. Apparently not. This needs to stop. See below:

pharmacy,Letters of Recommendation writers: how do you feel about this year's PHORCAS process?,"I just finished my writing my letters. Although I can barely call them letters anymore. I liked it better when I could write an actual letter, on letterhead, addressed to the RPD... one I could sign. Now it's just like completing another rotation evaluation form on E-Value or Resitrak.  You have some programs that want you to elaborate on topics A, B and C and other programs want X, Y and Z.  I get that it is more objective than some BS, generic, glowing letter that some writers write, but the PHORCAS process this year just seems so impersonal now that you can't include an actual letter. And not to be ostentatious, but PHORCAS also doesn't give you space for credentials or more than one title... it doesn't let you put in RPh vs PharmDs, board certifications, academic appointments, etc... that might lend a little to who the recommendation is coming from, which would otherwise be in the signature of a letter... I know letters don't count for a whole lot either way, but I just dislike the process as it stands.

As letter writers, what are your thoughts?",10,9,2014-12-31,PHARMA,0.03104734793305397,0.9389709830284119,0.02998163364827633
