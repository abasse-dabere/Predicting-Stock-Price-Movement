What are some of the best foods I can be putting into my system today and throughout the weekend?  I'm usually kind of a finicky eater, but I am looking at food purely as fuel right now...I don't care what it tastes like; if it's the shiznit, I'll throw it down!

My ideas:

* water, water, water, water, water...

* yogurt and English Muffins with PB&amp;J in the morning

* tunafish sandwiches 2 hours before

* apples right before matches, bananas after

* pasta and salad for dinners at end of day (load back up on carbs? I've heard that's important)

Health,Hello Reddit! Just wanted to let you know that yesterday I had 41 Million Adult Stem Cells injected into my spine to hopefully fix my disc degeneration. Wish me luck guys!,"I've been suffering from some pretty severe lower back pain and leg pain, all attributed to disc degeneration and a herniation (look it up for more details). So I decided to try something new: STEM CELLS! They are not embryonic... they are my own adult stem cells from my bone marrow. I'm betting on stem cells being the next leap for medicine. Lets hope it's true! 

EDIT: Wow thanks for your wishes guys! Some people have questions on the treatment so i'm posting my [forum thread](http://www.spinepatientsociety.org/forum/emerging-spine-surgery-technologies/ill-regenexx-stem-cell-therapy-guinea-pig-1149/) on the whole thing. 

A few answers to your questions:

* Stem cells are taken from bone marrow from both hips (the process is painful as hell).
* They are harvested for 3 weeks
* They are injected directly into the damaged disc using live x-ray.. it's actually a really complicated process and it hurts like hell!
* The clinic is in colorado, and they're having a few issues with the FDA because the fda is claiming that this is medicine and should be regulated.. the clinic claims it's not because it's a process using your own cells. Btw they are the clinic with the longest track record with the process.. so i'm a little optimistic. EDIT 2: apparently the fda issue was a confusion.. they did not send a warning letter, but more of an 'untitled letter' which has no formal effect. The guys that brough up the fda issue have issued this [statement](http://celltherapyblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/errata-statement-re-regenexx.html).
* I'm taking oxycodone to manage the pain after the stem cell re-injection procedure.

EDIT 3: Here's my [blog!](http://healingmyback.blogspot.com)

EDIT 4: I'm 2 days into my stem-cell re-injection. It seems that I have a couple of muscle spasms in my lower back (at least that's what I think).. I'm trying to calm them down before they cause any unnecessary pressure on my discs. Any tips on calming down my lower back muscles without using any medicine (i'm not allowed to take anything)?",154,314,2010-03-23,PHARMA,0.0438651517033577,0.9269976019859314,0.029137229546904564

I'm a US citizen and normally during the summers I go back to my other country to do volunteer/clinical work there while visiting my family. However, it would appear that military hospitals don't look too kindly on draft dodging. It's something I should have thought of earlier, but it escaped me.

Deadlines for most summer programs have already passed and I'm at a bit of a loss for what to do during this summer. Does anyone have any ideas?
