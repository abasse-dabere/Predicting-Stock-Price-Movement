medicine,"$10 for a house call, $7 for an office visit - According to Thalia Menninger on The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis","I'm watching an episode of _The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis_, aka _Dobie Gillis_, a series from 1959 to 1963.

Dobie is in love with Thalia Menninger, a pretty blonde who wants her man to make a lot of money. She likes Dobie even though he's not very smart or ambitious, so she tries to push him to be a doctor so he'll be a more acceptable mate.

She says doctors make $10 per house call, and if they have a fast car they can make $40/hour. An office visit only nets $7, but a doctor can stack patients and examine one while the other is undressing, making up to $60 or $70/hour.

Adjusted for inflation from 1960, those figures become $80 per house call, or $320/hour with a fast car. The office visit is $56 per patient, yielding up to $480 to $560 per hour.

Of course this is for a PCP, so at least in Thalia's mind, a family doctor could make over a $1,000,000 in 2015 dollars per year with a 40 hour work week. She never mentions paying staff, rent, or other costs, though.

Later she does more research, and decides dermatology would be a good specialty for Dobie, because they make a lot of money and hardly ever get called off hours. She also considers orthopedics, but says the real money is in surgery, and finally decides Dobie should do derm, ortho, surgery, _and_ internal medicine.

pharmacy,Advice for a Pharm Tech with little to no patience...,"Hello future Pharmacists of reddit, I need some advice. For the last 8 months I've worked at CVS, I've met some really interesting people that came in. There have been moments where I encounter patients that test my patience. To be honest, I hate myself for doing that. I'm tired of getting in trouble with the pharmacy manager. If I keep this up, I know for a fact that I won't have a job to keep soon. I try many techniques where I count backwards from ten, pretend to fake smiles when patients literally say ""fuck you"" to my face for no reason. I always go over the top to give the  best service for patients and for those patients can be rewarding, especially for CVS. However, there have been patients that yell at me, curse at me, and take advantage of me and yet even though I  help those patients, I never get a single thank you or they end up not wanting the medication. What should I do? I really need this job. I just graduated from a university and until I get to grad school I really need to keep this job. My boss has told me countless times and has given me many warnings and even though my co-workers back me up because they know how very kind, sincere, and hardworking I am, I do not want to lose this job. What do you techs do in these types of situations? The lead tech gives me advice and tells me how to talk to certain patients, but in the end it boils down to how I feel and how I am to the patient. I really like my job and its the first job that I had in a long time where I met people that work as a team and have treated me with respect. I am really scared and I don't want a bad patient to be the one to make it or break it in my career. Any advice? Also, I tried searching for past advice, but I really thought this would be nice to see what people thought about. 

Edit: Thank you so much for the advice. I looked at /r/talesfromthepharmacy and I noticed how much in common that I have with other techs. It's so sad to see how much of them are having a difficult time, but it's nice to know that there are people like me in the same situation. Thank you all for the advice. If you have something to add, please let me know! 

Edit 07/08/2015: I tried the things that worked out today and let me tell you, it worked! I followed most of your advice, today went a lot more smoothly, and I hope this keeps going well for me.

pharmacy,New Tech looking for a little advice,"hey /r/pharmacy,

I just started working as a Tech for a retail pharmacy. I'm only 3 full days into training, but as much as I can cover the customer service half of the job, I realize there is a *lot* I am going to need to catch on to.

One of the biggest problems I'm running into is just simply knowing the differences between medications, what they are for, and how to recognize them by Class as they come in. Right now, these medications might as well be a foreign language to me. I wish it were as simple as typing in whatever the medication was and sending it along to match names with names. But I know I am going to need to recognize my C-II drugs asap.

Also, are there other bits of advice that any of you experienced Techs can share that have helped you understand and feel comfortable in your job? Things you wish you would have known when you were starting out? And any general advice as well?

medicine,Why is silver sulfadiazine still the standard treatment for outpatient second degree burns despite its ineffectiveness?,"After getting prescribed silver sulfadiazine (SSD) for a second degree burn, I did the appropriate research on SSD and other treatments. 
Many of the studies conducted on SSD do not support its ability to prevent infection or heal at a faster rate. My question is whether this is common knowledge in the medical community already or if SSD has been erroneously condemned. And also more importantly **why standard treatment for (2nd degree) burn patients has not been adapted to a more appropriate treatment supported by research?**


 Several studies show either insufficient evidence/statistical insignificance or point towards its lack of efficacy:
&gt;There is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the routine use of SSD for ambulatory patients with either partial-thickness burns or stasis dermatitis ulcers to decrease mortality, prevent infection, or augment wound healing in human beings.


&gt;SSD does not retard epithelialisation of dermal depth injuries


On the other hand, honey has shown promise in various comparative studies:
&gt;Honey dressing improves wound healing, makes the wound sterile in lesser time, has a better outcome in terms of prevention of hypertrophic scarring and post-burn contractures... when compared to SSD dressing.


&gt;A complete outcome [healing with no scar] was seen in 81% of all patients in the “honey group” while in only 37% patients in the ""SSD group""""

Some of these studies are already 10 years old and yet SSD is still being prescribed today. If it truly is the inferior treatment, it is straight up *annoying* that hospitals and doctors are still prescribing it today and leaving burn patients with an inferior road to recovery. The only possibilities I can imagine are:

* if hospitals and doctors prefer to stick to the status quo until more definitive research comes out 
* lack of willingness to use treatments viewed as traditional (such as honey)

medicine,Patients' online medical research increases their perceived--but not actual--medical knowledge (results from survey posted to /r/medicine and /r/nursing),"The following data are from a survey I recently posted to /r/medicine and /r/nursing.  I promised to share a summary of the results...and here it is!

&amp;nbsp;

**Sample data:**

64 redditors completed the survey.  The following analyses will focus primarily on the 50 respondents who were medical professionals **with** regular patient contact (36 nurses, 7 doctors, 3 med students, and 4 ""other"" (specific positions not mentioned for anonymity)).  These individuals saw an average of 47.6 patients per week (range: 3 to 550).  Median patient SES was lower middle / working class.

&amp;nbsp;

**Patient use of the Internet for medical research:**

According to survey respondents, ~27% of patients explicitly mentioned using the Internet to perform medical or health-related research before visiting a medical specialist.  Another ~16% were suspected of doing so, for a total of ~43%.

[Chart here](http://i.imgur.com/12Ajy4j.png).

Note that this number is a bit higher than the estimate of 35% reported by Pew in 2013 ([report here](http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/01/15/health-online-2013/)).

&amp;nbsp;

**Effects of Internet research on patients' actual vs. perceived medical knowledge:**

Survey respondents indicated their perceptions of how using the Internet for medical research affects both how much patients *think* they know in this area and how much patients *actually* know.  In each case, these judgments were made as a comparison of online researchers vs. non-researchers.  These estimates revealed that, according to medical professionals, (1) online researchers *think* they know significantly more than they *actually* know (*F*(1,49) = 57.24, *p* &lt;.001) and (2) online researchers don't know any more or less than non-researchers (*t*(49) = 1.15, *p* =.26).

The graph below shows the difference between actual and perceived knowledge for online researchers vs. non-researchers (""0"" = no difference, positive numbers = higher knowledge for online researchers, negative numbers = higher knowledge for non-researchers).  

[Graph here](http://i.imgur.com/HTo7GRs.png).

For various reasons, I won't run any stats comparing these estimates to patients' own perceptions--but you can see in the graph below that people seem to think that online health-related research makes them know *much* more about medical issues than they would have otherwise (that is, if they were ""non-researchers""):

[Graph here](http://i.imgur.com/zpdjI0m.png).

&amp;nbsp;

**Downstream consequences of relying on the Internet for medical information and/or advice:**

I also listed a number of potential negative consequences of patient-driven online research and asked medical professionals to select any they had ""personally experienced as a result of patients using the Internet to find medical information or research their own health-related issues.""  The following figure shows the percentage of respondents who indicated personally experiencing each listed effect.

[Figure here](http://i.imgur.com/EhB19wl.png).

This survey is part of an ongoing program of research I have related to how Internet search affects what people know, what people *think* they know, and why this matters.

pharmacy,Question for pharmacists from a patient with ADHD and Panic Disorder. Am I judged by pharmacists?,"To set some context, I worry about things preemptively and way more than I should (probably has something to do with the anxiety disorder).

Ok so heres the story/question.

I've been on dexmethylphenidate xr/ir (xr am, ir afternoon) for about 5 years and clonazepam (0.5mg 3 times a day) for about 2 years I was lorazepam when my panic attacks were happening everyday, but I stopped it because it would make me fall asleep. I usually fill at the same CVS (or a CVS in general) and I've had the same doctor the entire time. Lately I've been traveling for work a lot towards the end of the month, so I drop my prescription off a few days early. Because of the schedule on those medications, I'd always let the pharmacist know ""I don't need them till they're due, just dropping them off in case they need to be ordered.""

Fast forward a few months, every time I go to CVS its always ""Out of stock"", ""Try XYZ pharmacy"", ""I'm not filling this."" or ""We can order this but it will be 2 weeks"". Keep in mind I'm only dropping them off at most 2-3 days early and always after the ""fill after date"".  I'm starting to get the impression that because of the medication and the way I look (I'm a scruffy 22yr old software engineer) I'm getting turned turned away because they think i'm a abusing them. Now I get it, you guys have to be on the look out for stuff like that (especially with the medications I'm on) but why won't some pharmacists just pull my insurance, call my doctor, look at their own history or just look at the PMP (I live in CA so I assume they can pull up every time I've even filled that prescription). 

It's becoming an annoyance because when I'm out of town and run out of the anxiety medication, I start to get more panicky because of the risks of stopping that medication... on top of not taking my anxiety medication. I don't even want to try to transfer/fill those medications out of town, because of the pain in the ass it is to fill them in town.

On the bright side though, I did find a pharmacy that seems to give patients the benefit of the doubt. I was driving around town, explained to him my situation and told all that stuff above (which probably threw up like 400 red flags). He told me they were out of stock and he'd have to order it. I saw him get on the phone (I assume to call my doctor and the CVS I told him I always fill at) and then he came back 5 minutes late and said ""I double checked, we actually do have this in stock.""  He (understandably) was suspicious (story about leaving town, first time filling a stimulant and a benzodiazepine at this pharmacy), confirmed everything was valid and sent me on my way 45 minutes later.  I should also mention that when I asked to transfer the refills of the clonazepam back to CVS (at the time I didn't intend to stop filling there in the future) he even asked me upfront ""why do you want to do that? It's very suspicious to fill a schedule 2 at one pharmacy and ask to transfer the other medications, even if its to your regular pharmacy."" 

Why don't other pharmacists just do that? Also, am I actually being judged on my appearance or is that in my anxiety fueled irrational head? There was one technician at CVS who was saying all sorts of insulting things like ""oh let me guess... you're on this for weight loss... you'll have to wait for the pharmacist"" (obviously not I've been on it forever and I'm still 30 lbs overweight). So, I bought some hand sanitizer, swiped my CVS card and when she saw i drive a BMW (I know it's a douchebag car, but I have to compensate for my insecurities somehow and buying a ridiculously expensive car does just that), after that it was ""Actually, if you hold on for just a moment, we can have it ready in 30 minutes""

What the hell man...

Anyways, that was my rant/question. 

PS. On a less tangenty note, how do I actually solve the problem of traveling at the end of the month for up to a week sometimes and not running out of my medication? Telling the pharmacy this doesn't seem to work (hopefully not the case with the non-chain pharamcy I found, but you never know). (its from LA to Mt.

pharmacy,Pharmacy Intern seeking advice on dealing with a difficult coworker.,"Hi all.

Some background:



I'm an Australian pharmacy intern (just passed my written exam- sort of the halfway point). In my pharmacy, there's 2 interns, one who looks after the webster patients (dose administration aids packed in-pharmacy) and the other looks after the banking.



I am the intern with the most experience (7 years pre-graduation) and as such was put in charge of websters. There's roughly 150 of them and it's a reasonably high-responsibility job.


I have 2 part-time webster packers so they get the packs done. One is fantastic, easy to getalong with and very efficient. She also presents any problems she forsees in a respectful but direct manner.


The other one has been working in the pharmacy for 11 years, and is currently in second year of pharmacy at uni. From the day we met, she has had a clear issue with me, partly I'd say due to the fact that I am 5 years younger than her and an intern and partly because she doesn't want to have to run things by me when she needs to. She possibly feels like she is more highly qualified than I. As such, she is quite rude to me and snaps when I ask her to do something.
However, despite working in pharmacy for roughly 4 years less than her, I have worked in several pharmacies and helped operate/manage some smaller pharmacies whilst at uni.



She is also rude to other pharmacists- she once told a pharmacist to ""do it yourself, you have two hands"". A few of us have spoken to the boss and he's said to sort it out ourselves.
I haven't had a problem with anyone else in the pharmacy- the manager and the boss, assistants/DTs and I get along quite well- it's just her.



I'd just like some advice on how to deal/communicate with her or perhaps I need a new perspective. I feel a bit strange being ""in charge"" in this regard, especially as I feel very aware of my being younger than her. But, younger/fewer years in pharmacy aside I feel she needs to respect my role.",5.0,6,2015-07-14,PHARMA,0.06310886889696121,0.8969839215278625,0.03990725055336952

medicine,An outsider looking in,"Hello all,

I am a software engineer working in the financial district in Manhattan.

I have a new girlfriend, who is going through her 1st year of residency.

Through her experiences, I've been open to this whole new world of stress and no sleep that many people in medicine are almost *expected* to go through.

Let's start off with me - I received a bachelor degree of science. I have worked at several different jobs in New York and New Jersey. This included a paid internship in my computer field, which I did when I was in High School.

All of these jobs, whether I liked them or not, had the following qualities:

1. I had to work 8 - 9 hours a day, except in some really rare curcumstances.
2. During these 8 - 9 hours, I had a full hour of lunch that I can take any time I want, as long as I get my work done.
3. If I give at least a month's notice in advanced, I can choose any set of days in a year that I want to go on vacation.
4. Any time I switched to a new job, I'd get a higher pay since I had new skills from the previous job.

Now, let me compare this to my SO:

1. She is expected to work at least 12 hours a day, but usually it goes on for 14-15 hours.
2. She usually has no time - She can get interrupted at any time with her pager and is forced to drop everything she is currently doing to address the current issue. This means potentially, no lunch.
3. She does not have a stable schedule - Residents who have been in the hospital for more years than her, set the schedule for some reason.
4. All of her vacation days have been set up in advanced before starting the residency. (If you get sick, you have to ask a friend to cover for you...)
5. She can't switch jobs. There is no alternative.

After understanding all of this, I quickly realized a few problems. But here is the major one:

Some time ago, a restriction was put on the amount of hours residents should work.

However, the hospital did not cut the amount of work required to be done. Hence, the hospital expects you to work faster. Doctors blame themselves when they cannot finish work as fast as has been set up for them. They lie on time reporting, to make it look like they finish everything within the legal limits.

I've been trying to find the cause of all of this... Why do residents get so much work? Why is are there so few residents working at a the hospital that there are no free people available to pick up if someone goes on vacation? Why is it so hard to find a hospital with open internship spots?

I've done a bit of research on this, and eventually found this lawsuit:

[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/us/medical-students-sue-over-residency-system.html](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/07/us/medical-students-sue-over-residency-system.html)

Apparently the whole medical match day system is responsible for artificially limiting the number of doctors that can work for a hosptial for some reason, plus they set the amount of money anyone receives, and how many hours they should work. Pretty much, they control the whole system, just like they used to do in the soviet union.

*EDIT: It looks like everyone is focusing on my example solution, instead of the problem. So, I'll cross the solution out, as that wasn't the point.*

~~The lawsuit was trying to get lots of money in compensation, and ultimately lost.~~

~~However, I'd propose something different that would not necessarily cause financial harm to anyone?~~

~~Increase the number of residents per hospital, but pay them less.~~

~~For example, if residents currently get $40,000 and work for 16 hours each, double the number of residents per hospital, and pay each $20,000 and work for 8 hours each.~~

~~This is considered continued education as opposed to employment, hence the pay would be considered more like a stipend.~~

~~The 8 hours would be less stressful. Plus residents wouldn’t have as hard as a time to find a hospital to work in.~~

~~That is just one solution.. but anyway,~~

The stuff doctors have to go through is really stressful, and I believe most people outside of medicine are unaware of the indentured servitude doctors have to go through.

If more people were aware of the difficulties that doctors have to go through, there would be reform going on.

It's just that doctors have been trained to follow directions, and that is what they do - even if it affects their long term health, wealth, and social life negatively.",13.0,8,2015-07-16,PHARMA,0.0846857950091362,0.8818135857582092,0.03350066766142845

medicine,[x-post from /r/medicalschool] Has anyone here considered practicing in a prison?,"Hi /r/medicine! Someone from /r/medicalschool suggested that I ask you guys about this:

So I know prison medicine has been stigmatized in the past, but I was reading recently that people are finding it pretty appealing because you treat a lot of people who haven't gotten a lot of care in the past and you get to do a lot of positive good. Also because you tend to have pretty good continuity of care with your patients.

I got to visit a prison clinic for an afternoon this summer, and the medical staff working there seemed to love it. So I've been thinking about it--but my question is this: if you go into primary care and practice in a prison, do you get to do a wider range of things than you would in regular practice? The facility I visited was very small, but I got the impression that they just kind of let you do whatever you are trained to do. Like they said ""Not all of our providers can put on casts, but when they can they save us a lot of money because we don't have to bring people out to the hospital."" Is this the kind of field where a primary care doc can kind of live the primary care dream and use their full scope of skills?

Flu vaccines alone can net you ~$25/ea in gross profit. You can get certified for TB tests, that's another $25-28/ea. You could charge for a ""travel clinic visit"" for people going out of the country, plus the cost of typhoid, yellow fever, Hep A, etc.

If you could get 16 patients per day (2/hr) at an average of $25 gross profit for 250 working days a year, that's $100k. (Obviously then you have the cost of the vehicle, gas, and other overhead). 

Obviously you'd make most your money during flu season, but there are plenty of travel consults to be had in the spring/summer seasons. Hospital workers need TB tests annually in most areas. And I'm sure there are other ways to make money that I haven't even considered yet.

medicine,Texas Lawmaker Wants People To Be Able To Carry Guns In Hospitals,"http://keranews.org/post/texas-lawmaker-wants-people-be-able-carry-guns-hospitals

&gt; A few years ago, when Republican Representative Drew Springer went to visit a Deputy Sheriff at Texas Health's Harris Methodist Hospital in Fort Worth, he had to leave his gun in the car.

&gt; “I go up and see the Deputy and then I come back,” he says, “and I spend the next ten minutes walking in a dark parking lot to get to my car in downtown Fort Worth and I absolutely did not feel safe.”

This seems like not a good idea to me, but I wanted to get some different perspectives on it. When my daughter works at the VA, which is actually in a bad part of town unlike Harris Methodist Ft. Worth, she has to get a security guard to escort her to her car. As a parent, I feel a lot more comfortable with that kind of setup than with her relying on her own gun for protection. Maybe Mr. Springer should have gotten a guard to escort him if he was scared, but then I don't know if there are enough guards to do that for everyone.

In the Old West, gun-toters often had to check their guns with the sheriff upon entering a town. Maybe instead of letting people carry into the hospital, there could be a gun check in at the entrance?

It just seems like if you let people carry guns into the hospital, bad things are going to happen.",45.0,8,2015-07-21,PHARMA,0.07866715639829636,0.8896699547767639,0.03166288137435913

pharmacy,Rite Aid system and deferring Rx,"I've noticed most stores get the majority of their Rx eprescribed nowadays and it seems like the system defaults them all to something like an hour from when they are received. This results in big clumps of Rx all turning red at the same time if you're not able to keep up. I figured out that if you defer it and then reprocess it, it puts it out 2 hours. For example, I had an order for 9 medications for 1 patient due in 7 minutes. I don't think there is a pharmacist alive that can safely check 9 new scripts in 7 minutes, but I will be ""penalized"" because the scripts turned red and were checked after they were due.  
  
Instead, you can defer the 9 scripts, then reprocess them and work on them in your own time, without feeling rushed and forcing yourself to make a mistake.  

Question is, is # of scripts being deferred tracked? Are you penalized for deferring too many scripts? Is the penalty for deferring scripts more or less than the penalty for checking them when they're passed due?",11.0,6,2015-07-21,PHARMA,0.08784765005111694,0.882706344127655,0.029445992782711983

pharmacy,"Working for CVS is very,very annoying.","This is a long story,I'm angry and on my phone so sorry for any mistakes. Thanks for reading.

Hi all.I got certified in March as pharmacy tech. I immediately started looking for jobs. June 8,2015, I had an interview with cvs and was hired on the spot. They told me I would get an email to accept the offer and fill out my I-9's and other onboarding paperwork. I got the email on June 11,2015. The next step was the store manager's. She was to accept that I had done the paperwork and send it off so I can begin in-store training. 

My training start date was supposed to be June 16,2015. So a couple of days before I try to get in touch and see if there was a certain time I needed to come in or if I needed to bring anything. I was told she wasn't there and would be in after 12. So I call back and they told me to leave my number and she would call back. June 15th I get no returned calls. June 16th I call. She's not in that day. So I call June 17th She's not in yet,well what time does she come in,hold on I'll check and the phone gets hung up. So I call back and they take my number and say they will give her the message. June 18th,nothing. June 19th I call,she's off for the day. June 20th,She's still off.JUNE 21ST HALLELUJAH! SHE ANSWERS! She tells me that she is supposed to call me I'm not supposed to call her at all. She was upset that I was calling about MY JOB! 

So she tells me to come to on June 23,2015 to get some of my info. I go on the 23rd and she tells me that because I waited so long I would have to do the new pilot orientation that they have. Which states that if you are hired on or after June 21,you have to do it. I told her I was hired on the 8th. She told me that it goes off when she accepts my paperwork which was just a second ago. So I just said fine, some progress is better than none. I have to attend an 8 hour class waaay across town. Yay.

June 26,2015 I attend the first orientation 8 hours,just giving me store values and things like that. I have another 8 hour class to attend that Monday. PROGRESS IS HAPPENING!After these 2 classes I am to complete a list of computer work before a certain date. I can do that no problem. I set out doing the work while working my other job(dog trainer) and going to school. But it's getting done. Only what the teacher has highlighted and specified. So it's all done. 

Next task, I have to go to my store to do register training for 4 hours(for free) and when I get there nobody knows who I am or what I'm there for. The previous store manager switched stores and that was it. So the lead customer service person is like if you're supposed to be here you can do it I guess. So I do the 4 hours and I'm ready to keep moving ahead. Apparently I can't do anything because the woman who is my trainer in this new program just left for a cruise for a whole week with no warning. So one week of working on computer work that I'm doing just to get ahead. When she comes back she apologizes and said my next step is to go to another cvs across town and do 8 hours of pick up and production training. I go and get it done. 

So I was told that after this on the job training with pick up and production I can get put on the schedule at my store. Great! Well, no. I call the pharmacist at my store and let him know I'm ready to work. My other boss at my other job is waiting for a schedule to work around. He said he will let me know because he wants me in the upcoming week BUT FIRST I have to do a couple of computer courses that I haven't completed. Oh well,I didn't know I was supposed to do these ,but ok.I ASK IS THERE ANY OTHER ONES THAT NEED TO BE DONE. HE SAYS NO! Ok I can do that. Finished those on July 10,2015 as soon as I was off the phone with him. 

I'm waiting for him to call me amd give me a time and a date to come in when my trainer calls me on July 13 and says that before I can work I have 5 computer courses that need to be done. Really?! Fine. If it will get me in the pharmacy faster I'll do it. So I gp through all 5 she had me to do but not before I ask her is that all that I have to do. Again she says after that I should be good to go. But wait there's more. Wednesday July 15 she calls me at 5PM saying that I have another 5 computer courses to complete  that has to be done by 10pm or I will be locked out of the system. Seriously?! I asked you and the Pharmacist did I have any other work to be done on the computer. You both said no plus the paper she gave me with all of the computer courses were done. But again my focus is that I want to get in that pharmacy so I finished at 9:59PM.No joking. So i email the trainer and ask when can I work now she says I need to get in touch with the pharmacist and ask him. He tells me to come in next week after I finish 2 more computer courses. I tell him no everything that i needed to do on the computer is done. He says ok I will call and let you know next week. 

On July 22, I call him I'm not waiting around for him to hopefully call. He tells me I can come in today July 22 at 12. So I wake up make sure EVERYTHING is taken care of I print my transcript of all of the computer work I completed just in case and I make it there at 11:35. The PIC there says the pharmacist i talked to isn't there yet but he will be amd before I start working I need to do the computer work. I tell her its done and she calls the store manager so he can check. He checks and sees that its okay so I go clock in and start working. The pharmacist I talked to strolls in at 12:15 and asks me why am I working. Uhh....you told me to. No,he says you can't work you are just up here to talk. OHMIGOD!So I clock out and he tells me he will get in touch with me to come in next week because he has no hours right now for me. I just said okay and left. And now I'm writing this out losing my mind.

So here's a thought, why not assign pharmacy patients to specific teams of people within retail pharmacies? For example: Mr. Smith comes to Big Box Pharmacy for his prescriptions. When Mr. Smith comes in, his prescriptions are always completely processed by Techs John and Joe and Pharmacist Tim. All parties are aware of this, and active participants, so when Mr. Smith calls with a question or for a refill, he knows to ask for Tim, Joe, or John and if an rx comes in for Mr. Smith, Tim, Joe, and John know to process it. Mr. Smith loves the extremely personal service and Tim, Joe and John can identify any potential errors much more easily as they are very familiar with Mr. Smith. Everyone is more accountable and more compliant which means better wellness.
