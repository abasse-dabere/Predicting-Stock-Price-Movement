Health,Anyone have experience with degenerative arthritis? My dad is shrinking (and choking).,"Hi Reddit - my dad was diagnosed several years ago with degenerative arthritis. He used to be nearly 5' 11"", and has shrunk about 4"" in the last 5 years to about 5' 7"". I guess the cartilage in between his spinal vertebrae actually disintegrates. However, while his spine is compacting on itself and he's getting shorter, his other organs are not. Namely, his esophagus is beginning to fold into itself. On a recent trip home during dinner, he spent about half an hour in the bathroom with a piece of food caught in his throat before he came out and asked someone to give him the Heimlich maneuver to get it out. He says he could breath, but he couldn't get the food up or down.

The thing that really (really) scares me is that my dad travels internationally up to two weeks every month and I'm terrified that he'll be somewhere and choke on something with no one to help him. Anyone every heard of this/dealt with this/know of any procedures or treatments that can help? Though he drinks a shit ton of wine (about 1+ bottle a night), he is very very active (mountain biker, hiker, climber, swimmer) and says he's otherwise in great health.

Health,How do you normally treat a headache?,"If it's mild, I usually just try to tough it out by suffering, taking a nap, dosing up on caffeine, finding a distraction, etc.  Sometimes I will roll a pen or pencil under my toes - a remedy my grampa gave me as a kid.  If it doesnt go away or if it gets worse or naggy I'll reach for the ibuprofen.  If it gets really bad or doesnt go away I just opt for getting cranky and reach for more ibuprofen.

I woke up from a late nap earlier and I developed a naggy yet mild headache.  I was hungry anyway so I went to Taco Cabana (sooooo good!!!) and ate, and caffeinated myself, and came home.  The headache got worse and worse.  I took ibuprofen, no help.  I finally popped a Darvocet, and it's going away.  I am thankful, but I hate having to take something like this for a headache.

My headache could have been caused in part by my meds, including the Darvocet.  I went to the doc the other day for some problems and he gave me darvocet, robaxin, and prednisone.  im always afraid of taking narcotics like pain killers and muscle relaxers because i have an extreme sensitivity to hydrocodone and it makes me sick.  im always afraid similar meds will make me sick.  this is part of why i take acidophilus, among other reasons.  it does help.  i cant take codones anymore, but it makes other meds more tolerable, if i have to take them.

anyway, im rambling.  be it the rain/barometric pressure (i have ear problems, changes in pressure are hell on my head, and my joints too), caffeine addiction, the meds, or the will of the flying spaghetti monster, headaches suck, regardless of cause.  i am looking for some remedies of the non-medicinal kind.

im out of herb, or i would have reached for that :)  if the darvocet didnt help my next step was going to be bubble bath.

Health,"So my heart has been fluttering irregularly for pretty much 3 days straight... I should probably go see a doctor, shouldn't I...","It started for no reason when I woke up at 3am to watch the Germany-Spain game and has continued fairly consistently since then. There may have been some time in there when I wasn't paying attention and it stopped doing it, but I'm pretty sure it has been doing it constantly and I just don't notice as much when I'm distracted. I've had fluttering like this many times before, though it has increased recently. A few weeks ago I felt a stabbing pain in my heart that lasted for about 10 seconds and could not be attributed to any physical exertion (walked home from work, which as about 5 minutes away and something I do every day). It felt like a needle was stabbing me a few times. 

The best part is is that I'm 24 years old and in peak physical fitness. I've been going to the gym regularly for the past 6 months and I also run long distance (when my legs aren't damaged) without much trouble at all (in terms of stamina). I wouldn't say there is any job-related stress or any anxiety about anything. I drank alcohol for the first time in a month last night, so it couldn't have anything to do with that.

...so I should probably go see that doctor, huh...?

Any ideas on what it could be?

EDIT: Add mild chest discomfort to the list. I'm off to the hospital now.

EDIT2: Just got back. The palpitations stopped before I got there so it didn't register on the test they did. Blood work came back clean. I'll probably have to do a 24 hour test so that they can actually catch it.",19,2,2010-07-10,PHARMA,0.12164100259542465,0.8405076861381531,0.037851348519325256

Health,Excessive sweating (hyperhydrosis?) Anyone had/seen anything that actually works to stop this?,"Since about 12 I've suffered exessive sweating. As a teenager I was very fit but still had the problem badly and it used to upset me a little but I could manage ok.

I'm currently about 12 months into the process of getting back into shape so I'm fairly healthy now and only improving as time goes on.

My self esteem took a massive hit as I grew overweight and this is of course improving as I regain my fitness but this problem is really starting to get to me. I'm starting to get pissed off at myself even though I know its not voluntary.

I've seen plenty of different types of deoderants and similar which are 'guaranteed proven' to lessen the effects dramatically but I'm yet to see anything actually work. It affects my entire body from my forehead to my feet and absolutely everywhere in between.

I've spent a lot of time reading up on the problem and keep coming across the same stuff over and over

Antiperspirants - Tried and failed with every type

Oral Medications - This one I'm not sure about

Surgery - Only useful if its in a single area

Botox - Only useful if its in a single area

Acupuncture - Why not rub some snake oil on it while I'm there?

Self Hypnosis - Again, snake oil


I know I come across as a bit cynical here but I am open to legitimate treatments. I really want to try get a handle on this because its making it impossible for me to function normally. I'm pretty much restricted to a monotone wardrobe since my back, underarms, shins and even the seat of my pants will often show sweat stains which is revolting even for me and of course very embarrassing.

I'm really getting desperate here. Any info would be very much appreciated.",71,28,2010-07-12,PHARMA,0.12994591891765594,0.8336285948753357,0.03642551600933075

I have not had a single shot since the first few at birth. Do I need to get shots, what for and why? I am always very healthy, but have heard that everyone should get shots to minimize the virus/flu. I am 20, live in Canada and would probably try to do this behind my parents back to minimize argument. How should I go about doing this?

And the question is... how the hell do I remove blackheads? I'm using a cream that prevents blackheads from turning into pimples/zits (and it's working wonders), but I have no idea how to actually remove blackheads. I could take each blackhead and squeeze it out (yeah, I don't know if it's like that for everyone, but most of the time, it's *that* easy for me), but I got a considerable amount it'll take a while to do squeeze every single one out... and my face will probably stay swollen from all the squeezing for hours or even days afterwards. 

Is there a better way other than simply squeezing? Any cream recommendations? If not a cream, any other removal method? Unfortunately, I don't have enough money for a dermathologist.

Health,Any vets out there? My beloved cat has been dealt high gamma globulin with tumors on his lungs &amp; one on his neck. Please help me with a second opinion.,"We got the bad blood test about a year ago: it was elevated gamma fraction immunoglobulins and the level has stayed steady since. He was given a bone marrow biopsy to check for myeloma and it (thankfully) came back negative. In February they suggested I see a kitty oncologist, which I did not do. I cannot afford such a lofty expense on my grad student stipend and I (more importantly) cannot put my cat through that horror.

About a month ago I discovered a mole-like growth on his neck. I kept my eye on it thinking it was a mat or just a mole. It got much bigger quickly.

Recently (weeks ago) he started coughing occasionally; it looks like he is going to blow a hairball, but I can hear mucus and so we know it's coughing. Tuesday night of this week I came home and he was wheezing with labored breathing, and that's when I started to get really upset. I made a vet appt for Wednesday morning and they did the following:
- opened the neck growth to reveal a partially-dead tumor (some blood supply had been cut off) and they removed most of it; there is still a dime-sized hole which he says will not heal but I am to keep mupirocin ointment and a clean dressing on it
- listened to his breathing and heart and determined he has labored breathing
- took chest x-rays and told me ""there are some small tumors on his lungs""
- took a sample of the neck growth for a cytology lab which can hopefully identify the source of the metastasis (he thinks the gamma globulin, the lung tumors, and the skin tumor are all related)
- took some more blood for complete blood work

He is a 12-year-old black domestic long hair that I have had since I was 18 (makes me 30 now). The only other issues we've ever had were a recurring bladder infection years ago that was nipped by putting him on Royal Canin Urinary food, which he is still on. He is eating and drinking okay and looks bright-eyed unless he is coughing.

Has anyone ever heard of this? Please help. 
Could it be something else? An infection?

Health,"Just turned 25 and have ugly, crooked teeth, and an ""eyetooth"". I hate them, I don't smile because of them. Anyone have experience with adult braces or other options?","I wanted to get braces when I was a kid. I asked for braces when I was 14, but my parents couldn't afford them and the insurance wouldn't pay for them (we didn't have good insurance, my parents were mostly self-employed).

I'm 25 now, I don't have a lot of money, I have a decent job and ok, but not great dental insurance. I'm not sure I could afford braces, but before I give it a shot I wanted to see if anyone could tell me about their experiences with adult braces.

I've considered just seeing if they can pull the eyetooth, then it wouldn't be so obvious whenever I open my mouth, but my father had one pulled and he said it fucked up all his other teeth nearby.

Aside from that I'm worried about, well, having giant metal braces for 2 years. 

I know the other options are invisalign (which I think I have too much movement required for invisalign to work properly), clear/ceramic braces (a possibility), or rear-tooth braces (again, I think the positioning of the eyetooth will preclude it from this option.)",20,6,2010-07-30,PHARMA,0.035348739475011826,0.9299775958061218,0.03467368707060814
