pharmacy,Guidance with quitting a tech job... is that a bad move?,"Ok, so I work at CVS, and we're understaffed ALL THE TIME, and I only get paid $8.85/hr. The reason I'm complaining about my pay is because I've worked there for almost 1.5 years, never take breaks, even during 14 hour shifts. I also come in early when I can, and I cover other people's shifts when they need help. I have the job for the experience since I'm applying to pharmacy schools at the moment... but I also need the money for rent, tuition, groceries, gas, etc... and even when I work 35+ hours (which is hard to balance with classes), I'm just not making enough for my needs.

I was thinking of applying to Giant Eagle and Target stores to see if I can get a better wage there, and then leave my job at CVS. Would that be a bad move tho? Because I want to have an intern position when I start pharmacy school next August. 

I just can't stand CVS right now. I came home with a really sore back, and have only eaten a granola bar and a frozen burrito all day, and worked 10.5 hours today. I got home and fell asleep in my work clothes for 2 hours, and just realized I have to do another LearnRx module by tonight. It was ridiculous how busy it was today too... for fellow CVS employees, there were 13 pages in Que, and 5 in QT, and I was working on prescriptions promised for 10:30am at 1pm.

-twitching in thighs and feet

I'm 14. I went to the doctors, I had good blood pressure and a good heartbeat. I take conserta, too and I'm a hypochondriac. She just thinks it's anxiety. I'm pretty worried, though, is it a sinus infection? I'm starting CBT in a few days and I talked to my school's phycologist she said I obviously have health anxiety.

I recently relocated to texas from colorado. I've been working with the same doctor for the past 4 years.  I take adderall 10mg once a day. Anyways, I can't fill the prescription from my doctor in colorado unless the pharmacy has filled a plan for filling out of state prescriptions with the DPS. I know a few of these pharmacies exist, I've spent hours calling and searching, but I keep getting stone walled. 

Does anyone from texas know of these pharmacies, or how I could find them? I also tried calling and emailing the DPS, but that could take a while. 

I know I could just go off my meds, but these have really helped me and I use them responsibly. I went from college drop out to productive graduate with a well paying job, through the help of my medication and doctor's therapy and hard work. I'd like to not have to change what has been working so well for me, if at all possible (seeing a different doctor etc.)

Health,"Took antibiotics a month ago. Thick mucus in stool all hours of the night now, or just passing mucus instead of stool. What might it be?","This is a bit of a gross read, so turn back if you aren't specifically able to help. :(

A month or two ago, I had an infection from a wisdom tooth. I took some antibiotics for it as a result (Cephalexin or Clindamycin).

After that things seemed to go fine, so I'm not sure if that was really relevant, but for the past week or two all bowel movements have been very strange. All of a sudden bowel movements became more difficult and coated in some thick yellow-ish mucus, occasionally orange-ish yellow. Then movements stopped being solid formations and turned into single, disjointed pieces surrounded by much thicker, less transparent mucus. Some movements have been nothing but mucus. A lot of nights I just keep constantly going back and forth between the toilet trying to pass a single movement over a stretch of time, or waiting for the mucus to stop. Since I a night owl and awake during these hours, it isn't wrecking my sleep schedule.

I've been taking a daily probiotic (otc, 20 billion bacteria) for about a week now in case there's something wrong with my digestive system, but I'm not sure if it's helping or not.

There was one night after I had eaten nothing but vegetable+beef+tomato soup for almost two days and the movement came out in a single, large chunk that passed quickly and without any complications, but I'm not sure how that happened or why soup would do that.

Laxitives were attempted on two seperate occasions, but don't appear to have changed anything.

My stomach has also had some minor pains throughout a day every now and then, but all it really feels like is like when you have a very, very slight cramp. It's not distractingly or worryingly painful.

Does anyone have an idea what it might be based on the symptoms? Is it something that might pass with time, something that will get worse, or something specific I should be taking to cure it?",2.0,5,2013-10-05,PHARMA,0.2716309428215027,0.7023831605911255,0.025985848158597946

Health,Can someone put my mind to rest?,"So I have a bit of an issue. I have had a wickedly sore throat since the 6th of September. I've been to the doctor a total of six times, nobody seems to have any idea what it is and seeing as it is something they don't recognize, they don't find it all bothersome. 

So here's some symptoms:
-Brutally sore throat: mainly when I eat, talk, swallow (especially) and sometimes breathe.
-Headaches (I get a lot of them though, so that could be unrelated)
-Sore neck (Might be related to the headaches)
-Loss of appetite
-I am not coughing, no runny nose, nothing other than the throat

So I will start from the beginning, sorry if it's long, I want to give as much detail as I can. On the 6th of September, I woke up with a sore throat. I looked in the mirror and my mom insisted I go to the E.R. After a nice morning visit to the ever so populated waiting room, the doctor briefly looked in my mouth, poked my tonsils with a swab and prescribed some Atasol 30 and Penicillin. I was told to take the Penicillin only if I get a call saying the swab was positive for strep. I decided to fill it and then wait and see. After not getting a call, I took it anyway, deciding that it was something bad and it deserves to die. 

During my Penicillin treatment, I went to my family doctor, who swabbed again and told me much the same that the E.R doc told me. After that it started bleeding and secreting more pus. My headache got worse to the point where I couldn't and didn't want to eat or do anything. I went back to the doctor and they did bloodwork, looking for CDC (CBC?) and mono. They both came back fine. 

I then went back to the E.R the other day (Monday) and they swabbed, took bloodwork and did a soft tissue X-Ray of my neck. Everything is apparently fine, and the doc says she thinks that it is a chronic tonsil infection or something rather.

Health,I have a tingling/burning sensation across my upper back that sometimes spreads to my chest and upper arms. Anyone know what this could be?,"Hello Reddit. As the title says, I am frequently experiencing a tingling/burning sensation across my upper back that sometimes spreads to the middle of my chest and upper arms. 

The best way I can describe it is that it is a very prickly feeling that isn't quite painful, but nevertheless very uncomfortable. The sensation acts up when I move in certain positions, such as when I bend down or am doing physical activity (not strenuous exercise, just building and lifting furniture for example). It also randomly occurs for no apparent reason.

I went to the doctor to see what they had to say and she didn't really seem to know what was wrong with me. She suggested to come back if it keeps occurring. I also looked my symptoms up on the internet but never could find a clear answer as to what was wrong with me, nor did I find a solution to my problem. 

I am a 19 year old female and I would really like to know what I can do (if there is something I can do) to help it. Has anyone else experienced this?",16.0,8,2013-10-06,PHARMA,0.14010089635849,0.8267905712127686,0.03310854360461235

pharmacy,Million dollar idea from a very confused couple today.,"I'm an assistant in a busy retail chain pharmacy. There was a young (late teens) couple slowly cruising the aisles together today, rubbing noses and giving quick little kisses. Pick up one bottle of vitamins, make a little joke, continue to hold eachother close as they stroll through the aisles. They slowly go up and down each aisle, it takes them about 15 minutes and 27 kisses to get through our supplements, mealreplacements and weightloss sections. 

I assumed they were waiting for a prescription, but another assistant must have noticed them as well and made a comment that they didn't drop anything off. It's just young love hanging out at their favourite retail store. They eventually make it near the cash register at the end and an OTC worker asks if we can help them, they say no, but before turning away the female says she has just thought of a question for the pharmacist. 

Talking at an above average volume, and making it obvious she wants to be heard, she loudly states that shes familiar with Plan B, and has use it twice before, but was wondering why companies haven't ""smartened up"" and started selling month and year supplies of Plan B. I can't even imagine the look of confusion she got from the Pharmacist. 

Then I hear this beauty:

""I mean why don't they just sell like a one month supply, so you can just take 2 pills every morning and you don't ever need to worry about getting pregnant!""

medicine,"The patient who demands meds, and saying no.","I had a patient a few months ago who was sticking in my head recently, thought I'd throw it out there as a thought exercise.

He was a young guy, new to the practice. No medical issues except for anxiety. During the H&amp;P, though, it came out that he'd used illegal drugs in the past, and was on house arrest for a DUI a few months earlier.

He was repeatedly asking for benzodiazepines. After counsel with my attending, I refused- we opted to try paxil, and he agreed to try for a few weeks, and come back for followup.

A week later he calls in, states he can't afford the paxil ($40 a month self-pay) and repeated his demand for benzodiazepines. I reiterated that I wouldn't give those without seeing him, and he relented, saying he'd try the paxil and come in the next week for followup as scheduled.

Two days later, he called at 0830, stating that the paxil wasn't working, and if I didn't call him back by 1000 he was going to file a complaint. As I wasn't in the office that day, I didn't get the message- there wasn't a page, just a task in our system.

The quandary is this. I'm a family doc. I don't turn people away. Yet, with this guy I see nothing but trouble on the horizon. I'm not going to give him benzodiazepines without very good reason due to his drug and alcohol abuse history, yet he's already made it clear he'll complain if I don't bend to his every whim.

Help me decide if I need blood work for testosterone replacement, or hypoglycemia, or other issues.","I'm 25 year old male. 12% bodyfat, cholesterol and blood pressure all good. As stated in the title, I don't drink soda, I eat a variety of foods, watch my macro intake, get 7-9 hours of sleep a night, workout 6 days a week. I drink about 125oz's of water during my work day, and a few pounds more when at home.

And yet every evening around 5:30 I get incredibly tired and need to nap for at least two hours. I can tough it out until 8 where I once again feel awake. In fact, I could nap at any point in the day, multiple times. I've done it before. And I'm still tired.

Throughout the work day I have trouble concentrating. 

I have never been able to sleep through the night. Every night I wake up multiple times. Been like that for as long as I can remember. I keep the room cool, I bought a memory foam topper, a memory foam pillow, and still no dice. I don't have the effects of sleep apnea that I've noticed.

I do need coconut water before I go to bed otherwise I get bad cramps.

Health,Doctors stumped with my GF,"I know that you can't rely on the internet for medical advice, but we are in desperate need of help.
My girlfriend is sick and none of the doctors at the University’s hospital can figure out what’s wrong.

Timeline:
Two nights ago:
Around 9 o clock she started getting quiet and seeming “off.” When changing to go to bed, she put a tshirt on backwards, and when I informed her of it, she looked down and told me that it was on correctly. She then proceeded to mumble and act really strange. During the night, she  was burning up and took off almost all her clothing despite the cold temperature in my apartment.

The next day she woke up and felt light headed. She went to work and a scheduled doctor’s appointment at noon, but she had started to lose feeling in everything on her right side. They took her to the hospital where she received two neuro consults after a CT scan and MRI, but they have no idea what’s wrong. They blamed it on psycho sematic causes.  Oh, and she can’t swallow even though her throat isn’t even red.

She can move everything on her right side, but is having trouble talking due to numbness and is losing her short-term memory.  To further complicate everything, she is having trouble finding words to answer questions and woke up this morning and tried to get ready for class because she thought it was Tuesday.

TLDR:
She can’t talk right, is numb, but can still move. Clean blood and urine. No drug use or medicine reactions. Neuro ran CT and MRI scans with no indications of clots or brain damage. Docs sent her home blaming it on stress.


EDIT: docs think it's conversion, so we're going home to try to get her to calm down and wait for her system to go back to normal. Thanks for the help everyone. 

EDIT #2: They gave her a Xanax at the hospital around one pm, and she is currently doing much better. She isn't completely better, but there is marked improvement.

Health,Did I just have a stroke?,"Hi folks -- some quick background: I'm 24, male, relatively good shape, not taking any medication, and have no family history of anything serious (that I know of). Earlier tonight, I was in bed browsing the internet, when I decided I needed something from the kitchen. So I went to stand up, but the next thing I know, I'm on the floor. My left leg felt completely numb (heavy and dead, not even tingling), and I couldn't for the life of me stand up. I pulled myself onto my bed and started massaging it, and within one or two minutes, the feeling gradually came back.

Needless to say, I was a little paranoid (my uncle had a terrible stroke a few years ago, and all I could picture was him the whole time). So I went to emergency and yadda yadda yadda I finally see one of their higher up attendants (who I'm not sure was even a doctor), and they told me that, given the fact I'm young and healthy with no history of this type of thing, it was probably just a compressed nerve somehow. Apparently, even if they did a CT scan, they said anything that made that kind of weird blip probably wouldn't show up.

Thoughts? I'm still a little paranoid, even though I feel fine now. I have headaches occasionally and for the last few months my vision's been giving me a bit of grief (I see a lot of floaters), but the optometrist said nothing is wrong with my eyes either.

medicine,UK medical graduates working in the USA?,"Hi meddit!

I have some questions regarding working in the USA as an international medical graduate (IMG) from the UK.  I hope that you can help, as this is a big decision for anyone to make, and I'm not quite getting straight forward answers elsewhere.



Firstly, I am a US citizen who moved to the UK as a kid, and my partner whom I met in med school is a UK citizen. He was a mature applicant to medicine, so we don't want to be wasting too much time.  We both went to a top 100 world-wide university and have BScs, (mine is 1st class, partners is 2:1).  However during our clinical years of med school (last 3 yrs), we had personal issues, and our grades slumped - no exams failed, but if I'm being honest with myself, I'll admit to being near the bottom of the class - same for the partner.  We are currently working in our first post-graduate year as doctors in the UK (Foundation).  Neither of us have publications so far.  As far as visas for the USA are concerned, we will probably get married so that he can get a green card.



Here are my questions:

* I hope to go into a surgical career, possibly even plastics.  Is this pretty much impossible for someone applying to a surgical residency as an IMG, as well as my med school grades?  My BF wants to go into a medical specialty; is this any easier? Would I have to give up my desire to be a surgeon if I wanted to work in the US?




* Secondly, as far as I can see, applying for a residency will require academic transcripts from med school, and ours are rubbish. However we did go to a top 50 in the world-ranked med school.  Is this a big problem, or are the USMLE's more important?  We haven't even thought about studying for them yet.



* We would ideally like to end up somewhere on the West coast (Washington is 1st choice), or in the northeast of the US.  How competitive is it to apply for these places?  Is applying for residency something that is done centrally or does one apply to individual cities/med schools.  I'm still unsure how all of this works...



* Would you recommend that we don't link our applications?  I've read that this would put us at an even bigger disadvantage. 



* Another thing that is being discussed are US letters of recommendation.  I assume that we would need to spend our annual leave in the US shadowing in the relevant specialties to get a letter of recommendation.  How many of these would we need to get?  Also if we were to shadow, how long a period would this need to be for?  Most time we can get off work in one stretch would be around 2-3 weeks.

I would be most grateful for any advice, also if there are any other UK medical graduates that would be fab!",29.0,8,2013-10-13,PHARMA,0.03220587223768234,0.9239857792854309,0.043808404356241226
Health,Movement feels extremely fast,"So I remember getting this somewhat frequently as a kid, where things would feel extremely fast, despite it only being at regular speed. I remember having this mental image when my eyes were closed, of this black background with these kinda stretched pixels/lines rushing by. I get it very rarely now, probably once a year. The last time I got it I was just sitting on my computer when it hit me. I tried testing it, by moving my hand really slow, but it still felt like it was going a 100 miles an hour. I can see perfectly fine, that it's going at normal speed, it just feels extremely fast. My hearing also seems to get enhanced. It only lasts for a couple of minutes.

1) Is this a medical condition of some sort?

2) What is causing it/why does it happen?

3) Just a thought I had. Does any drugs give you this feeling?

medicine,What I wish I could have told my dentist and hygienist today,"That I'm sorry I'm really fucking depressed.

And I'm sorry I'm not a model patient anymore.

I go days without showering and weeks without brushing my teeth, and I know it's worse than the last time I was there a year ago when I had the strength to shower most days and only went a few days between brushing. 

And I'm sorry I cried in the middle of my cleaning. Sobbed. I felt like a dead man walking the whole way there and then I got in the chair and I was in my head and it was just me in there with my thoughts. I'm fucking scared of you bastards in general, but you guys were nice to me before I got so badly depressed, and so I keep going back because I think you'll be nice to me again. You kind of have been. You didn't throw me out and you treated me, but you were pissed that I wouldn't take the x-rays and you made me sign a waiver. I explained that I'm scared of the radiation because I've had a lot of radiation this year but besides that I can't really afford the fucking x-rays anyway. It's been like this for a couple of years now with the money. I don't want to tell you that I'm going to have to live a little lean next month or two to pay of the credit card I used to pay for the visit. I wish you would have asked about the radiation. I was so sick. I wouldn't have been able to tell you that I went through it all alone because my depression has left me without friends or family, but it would have felt good to see that someone was concerned. Then again maybe it's better that you didn't show compassion because I probably would have cried again.

Please know that I wasn't trying to be a dick when you asked me why I haven't had the root canal yet. I want it but have no dental insurance and can't afford the procedure out of pocket. Even worse, I'm fucking scared of new dental people. Then you asked if I wanted the tooth pulled. I said no and you walked off. I know it doesn't make sense. I know. I don't know what to do. This is one of the problems with me and depression is that I'm really fucking confused. Maybe not confused. I'm like a deer in headlights. I don't know what to do. 

This depression will kill me. I hope it lets me go soon. I couldn't tell you that to your face either.

I'm sorry.

I'm not looking for help or advice. I posted this to /r/medicine because it's easier to explain myself when I'm not around people. The whole way home I just wanted to apologize to my dentist and hygienist. I wonder how many people are out there like me going to professionals like you. I know I walked in on my own steam and I look normal and probably even act mostly normal but inside my brain is a clusterfuck, and because of it I can't tell you to your face how sorry I am. I don't think you all know that. I'm sorry.

**Edit:** I want to thank everyone who took time out to reply to offer support or advice. All I wanted to do was apologize. Now I want to clear a few things up. 

- I've been depressed for a few years at this point. I've been on all kinds of medicine and talked to many people. It just keeps getting gradually worse. The difference between me 3 months ago and today isn't big, but the difference between me 5 years ago and today is major.

- I have health insurance but not dental insurance. The health insurance side is strict about using in network doctors, and they pay shit for people out of network. Maybe they pay shit all around. Who knows. Anyway, I can't go out of network because I can't afford full price and I make too much money to be considered charity. (And before I get a PM about how I must be wiping my ass with hundred dollar bills, I'll tell you now that I really am careful.)

- I think the dentist knows I have depression because you have to update your medications with them. I think he'd recognize names like Ativan.

- The health issues early this year have been resolved. They just had to take a lot of x-rays and gave me an MRI to find out what was wrong. I'm completely better now.",24.0,90,2013-10-17,PHARMA,0.1547941118478775,0.8163944482803345,0.028811419382691383

Bachelor's in Chemistry

2.8 GPA

3+ years Pharmacy Tech, certified

95 PCAT score

Chem lab assistant in college

Good letters of reccomendation


I have two concerns: his GPA and lack of community service. He worked full time for most of his college career and paid for it mostly on his own. My questions to you are:

1. For schools that require a GPA minimum above 2.8 - should he even waste the money applying? Or would they make a special case?

2. Should he address his low GPA in the application essay? I mean, he was working full time while taking PCHEM and the like.

3. What could he do to make up for his lack of community involvement? We have barely scraped by so he spends all his time working.

Thanks for reading this. The whole process is very expensive and I want to get as much information as possible before submitting all these applications.

This business of drug levels reducing in relation to their half-life confuses me a little. I'd like to know when a drug will be completely out of my system, but if it is only determinable in terms or periodic ""halving"" of concentrations the logic would be that it never leaves entirely but would just continue reducing into more and more infinitesimal amounts, in a Zenos Dichotomy Paradox sense. I have looked all over the web for information on when a drug is entirely out of your system but people constantly refer to this issue of the drugs half-life, nothing else. And this itself is a measurement, normally, of just blood plasma concentrations. What about if it is lipid stored, or deposited into bone material?

Health,Wart issue that needs to be resolved immediately!,"Hi, I'm a 15 year's old and I'm a male. As the title states I have a wart issue well technically 10 issues. It started about two years ago with I tried getting a bad splinter out of my left index finger, I eventually got it out but it was deep and took a lot of effort. I don't exactly know when but a wart appeared on the side where the splinter was. This one is the main and largest one currently, and now has two smaller ones beneath it. I also have another one of my right index finger which is quickly becoming an issue, a small one of my right hand pinky, one on the edge of the underside of my nail so that it is just visible, another on my palm small also seated where my thumb joins my palm and one above it on the print of my thumb, the other two are on my nose, small but just noticeable is you look (seated just in the opening of my nostril and on the edge of the same nostril. 

Now I've tried freezing them off, first time went well but have not seen much improvement as it grew back. Since tried using an acid paint which I use but often forget or don't have enough bandaids to cover them when I'm done, I'm now going in every three weeks to get liquid nitrogen applied to them all. I'm beginning to get very, very worried that they will continue to spread and get bigger and become more numerous. Does any one have any advice, cures, solutions etc that I could use. I'm considering getting them cut out but only as a last option. Also asked my GP if I could get a numbing agent injected to my hands so that the Liquid Nitrogen could be applied for a longer period, could any of these work? Thank you for any suggestions!

Health,What type of specialist should I see regarding my acute neck pain /limited range of motion?,"Full disclosure: approximately 4 months ago I slid into the boards in hockey and suffered whiplash and had a sore neck that went away after about 2 weeks using moist heat treatment and emulgel. 

Approximately 3 weeks ago I took a hit to the the upper body/chin in hockey at nearly full pace. Having had concussions before, I'm rather certain that I didn't suffer a concussion. Aside from my jaw feeling sore immediately afterwards, I went to bed rather painless and woke up OK. Throughout the day at work I was intermittently cracking my neck (this is a bad habit I have) to relieve some of the lingering pain when somewhat suddenly my muscles began tensing up in my neck/shoulder and pulled so much on one side that my posture was tilted and my head was being pulled down on the left side because of my shoulder muscles being so tense. After going to see a massage therapist that day, my loosened muscles allowed me to realize the pain was coming from the base of my neck and my head felt heavier than usual. Upon seeing a doctor, I've had x-rays which were negative for a fracture and have been prescribed muscle relaxants. 
For the past 3 weeks I've been suffering from what began as a more sharp pain to now dull pain stemming from the base of my neck. It seems that the pain is related to my spine but it's difficult to say for sure. The area that is in pain is very exact and seems to hurt more on one side than the other. My range of motion is limited when I turn my head side to side and I have been using my whole body to turn lately. I'm in the most pain in the mornings upon waking up and then at the end of the day, even though I've been giving it a lot of rest and using a towel to support my neck when sleeping. Whenever I use the muscle relaxants or massages to relax my muscles,the pain becomes even more acute and intense, which leads me to believe my muscles are sore because they've been working overtime to protect my spine (I could just be self diagnosing though). Who should I see about this and could it possibly be a pinched nerve or a flare up of my previous whiplash? 

Thanks so much for any advice.

**Edit:** I should also mention that I've been feeling an unusual ""numbness"" in my ear from time to time (kind of feels like when your ears are about to pop when going up a tall building). The numb feeling is more pronounced when I stretch out my neck and back to one side to relieve tension that has built up after a long day. For a few days in the beginning I also felt as though my arm would get sporadic tingling/numbness but it's difficult to say whether or not that was just because it had fallen asleep in bed.",4.0,7,2013-10-22,PHARMA,0.15607605874538422,0.8128733038902283,0.031050605699419975

I have a quick question regarding differences between MD and DO. I understand MD is doctor of medicine, and DO is doctor of osteopathic medicine.

Most people I have spoken to gave me similar answers. I'll list it off below:
- MD is allopathic and DO is holistic
- one extra year of school if you go to DO school
-it doesn't matter because they're basically the same
- MD schools weigh academic performance over life experience and DO schools weigh life experience over academic performance. 
- DO are for family practice, MD are for specialties.

These sound very general and I feel there are information I am unaware of. Are there any key differences between the two I should know? Also, i have been told MD and DO will one day be the same, and that there will be similar residency opportunities presented to both MD and DO. Is that true?

I'm a female in my 20's living in a small town. I had a serious car accident and was on very high doses of pain medication for almost 3 years. After a surgery the pain pretty much resolved itself and I didn't feel like I needed to be on anything stronger than ibuprofen. I stopped taking the pain medication and got unbelievably sick. I saw my surgeon and she told me that I was going through withdrawal due to the fact I had been on the pain meds for so long. I was naive- I wasn't abusing the medication, and thought things like this only happened to people who abused it. I couldn't take the withdrawal- I couldn't even get out of bed, sleep, etc..never mind work. My doctor suggested I start suboxone. I did research, and there was only one doctor in my area certified to prescribe it. This is where things started to get strange. Within 2 minutes of sitting down with this doctor he told me I was beautiful. That didn't bother me, but it's gotten worse and worse the longer I've been seeing him.

Each appointment he gets more and more ""forward"" and aggressive with his remarks. He tells me he finds me very attractive, that I should get back into modeling, and is always asking about my boyfriend. We have a WONDERFUL relationship. Last week he told me there are ""are a million fish in the sea"" and I shouldn't ""tie myself down"". I'm tall, and my doctor is tall as well. He told me I should be with ""someone very tall, like him"" and winked. At least 1/2 of each appointment is him going off about how I look. Like I said it's getting worse, and I feel SO uncomfortable.

 I don't know what to do. The suboxone has helped me tremendously, and it's not a medication I can just stop, or I will go through withdrawals as well (I have started tapering down so I can stop taking it, but it doesn't happen overnight). The obviously solution is to start seeing a new doctor, but that's not an option. He is the only doctor within a 50 mile radius of where I live that is licensed to prescribe the medication I'm on. There 3 other doctors (an hour away) but none are accepting new patients.


I don't have anyone to talk about this to, and don't know how to handle it. Am I overreacting? I'm a pretty shy person. I've heard him yelling at his office staff (very small office) and am afraid to say anything to do him- I don't want him to get angry with me, and if I stop going I'll be without an RX and be back at square one.


I wanted to reach out and get opinions from others on how this should be handled. Thanks in advance for your help!",106.0,99,2013-10-24,PHARMA,0.14381903409957886,0.828576922416687,0.02760404348373413

pharmacy,Pharmacies eliminating the clerk position?,"In the recent years I have been working as a technician, the clerk position (cashier) in my company has essentially become extinct.  In the early 2000's there was 1 full-time (40 hrs/week), clerk who handled ringing up and receiving patient's prescriptions.  In the years following, the ""clerk"" position slowly diminished to the point where there is essentially no dedicated clerk.  (one guy comes in on monday's and works for 4 hours at the counter)

The sales have not gone down, the customer base has not decreased whatsoever (profits haven't been higher), yet this important position has been removed which has caused technicians to run back and forth (from the register to the computer) to essentially do the job of 2 people.   

I feel like I'm doing 2 jobs for one paycheck and when I bring it up, the corporate office will say how they have to meet their numbers and can't add any more hours to the pharmacy.  Is anyone else experiencing this where you work?


Also, how do pharmacists feel about not being compensated for the added task of administering vaccinations like flu and shingles?

Health,Fungal Infection on Face -- NO INSURANCE -- Please Help!!,"So, about 3 weeks ago, I noticed a small red itchy blotch on my chin. I figured it was just some blemish, so I kept it clean, washed it several times a day, etc. Then it started to spread up toward my mouth, then it got leathery, and another red blotch formed around my eyebrow and close to my eyelid.

I did some research online, 99% sure that it is a fungal infection, bought some Lamisil and Tea Tree Oil, and have been treating it at home. It's gotten waaaay better, it's barely even itchy anymore, no longer scaley/raised, but it's most definitely still there, but only as a red blotch.

Now, I looked into it further and have decided to go to the doctor to get some oral medication and get it cleaned up for good. BUT, I have some questions before I jump into the doctor's office, considering that I have no health insurance:

1. Should I go see a general doctor or go straight to a dermatologist? I'm very concerned that I'm going to go to a general doctor, pay the $50, then they're going to send me to a dermatologist, then they're going to have to run some tests, which are super expensive on their own, etc. I don't mind spending money on this, as I'm expecting it to be moderately expensive as it is, but should I just skip the general doctor and go to a dermatologist, or will a general doctor be able to diagnose me and get me a prescription right there in the office?

2. How quickly can something like this be diagnosed? Obviously it could be something very different than what I think it is, but if I go to a doctor/dermatologist, will I have to wait 7+ days for lab results to come back, then run me around to different doctors, or will they be able to look at it, diagnose me, and give me a superscription all in one shot?

Miscellaneous info: I live in Brooklyn, NY, am a mid-20s male, am otherwise in good health, didn't change detergents recently or anything like that, and did I mention I have no insurance?

Thank you so much to anyone that can lend a little advice. I'm going to a doctor, so that's not an issue. I just want to know what I'm getting myself into money-wise and time-wise.

Health,My father has complex and debilitating heart troubles and I would very much appreciate opinions (xpost to r/cardiology).,"I will do the best to explain, though forgive any confusion, I'm not very knowledgeable on terminology and may have misunderstood some things.


Thank you in advance and I would feel much better if responders would state there position in the medical field or in training but, if you would not prefer to do so I understand. If you have been through a similar situation your advice is also well appreciated.


My father is 56. He has a list of issues such as:

-Born with a hole in his heart *

-Cardiomyopathy/ Grossly enlarged heart

-Has experienced arythmia and ventricular tachycardia

-Pacemaker/ Defibrillator

-Lack of an atrial lead **

-Ankylosing spondylitis ***

-Acid reflux (unsure if this is an important detail).


*Repaired at age 3.

** The area in which an atrial lead would usually go has been removed as result of the repairs at age 3 and there are large amounts of scar tissue in the area preventing a working insertion point. It is also worth mentioning he has had 3-5 pacemaker/defibrillators and there are many dysfunctional wires in his heart.

*** Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease that can cause some of the vertebrae in your spine to fuse together. This fusing makes the spine less flexible and can result in a hunched-forward posture. A severe case of ankylosing spondylitis can make it impossible for you to lift your head high enough to see forward. Ankylosing spondylitis affects men more often than women. Signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis typically begin in early adulthood. Inflammation also can occur in other parts of your body — such as your eyes and bowels. ( http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ankylosing-spondylitis/DS00483 ).

Currently it seems he is only getting worse and I am told he is in heart failure. He believes, though he cannot see a doctor as nobody will seem him for a few months, that his circulation is rapidly worsening and he is afraid of something called pulmonary hypertension. I don't know that this has been diagnosed.


He also takes the medicines listed in this image: http://i.imgur.com/oTnuIm3.jpg 


Once again, thank you for taking the time to read this. Prayers are always appreciated.

Health,A little confused about a diagnosis I just got...,"Hey y'all at r/health,
I recently went in to see a doctor about what I thought were some skin tags around my pubic region/on my penis.  Turns out they were genital warts.

Here's why I'm confused.  I've only been sexually active with my wife.  The warts/tags/whatever they are started showing up while I was in Army Basic Training a little less than two years ago.  They multiplied when I got to the Defense Language Institute and started up an extremely stressful year and a half language course.  

My wife has had a few partners before me, and the doctor suggested that she could have picked it up from one of them.  She herself shows no outward signs of HPV, and he said she probably had a genetic resistance to that (and she does have some really amazing, blemish-free skin.)

The problem is that she went to the ER for a UTI a few months ago and they specifically gave her an HPV test because she had a few weird looking bumps down there.  The test came back negative.

Was I mis-diagnosed?  Or is my wife just a freak?  I'm pretty confused because I can't think of anywhere else I could have picked this up.

Health,Desperate for possible solutions/diagnosis. Only when driving on interstate I fall asleep at the wheel.,"I know this is going to sound super strange but please hear me out.

I am a relatively healthy 27 year old female. I am not overweight, I exercise a bit and eat well. I sleep a very similar schedule every night (11pm-6:30am) without any interruption. I work as a dental assistant so I am not sitting for long periods of time and work about eight hour shifts.

My problem is becoming very very dangerous and I am desperate for any direction so I can try to fix this. When I drive alone and at high speeds (interstate) I have an overwhelming mental state that takes over and I CANNOT stay awake while driving. The fatigue is so strong I have fallen asleep while driving and will suddenly wake up when I have driven over the bumps/grooves in the cement on the shoulder. As soon as I snap awake from one of those adrenaline rush situations I will be awake for another three minutes tops before my eyelids are so heavy and I am shutting one eye at a time to try and keep driving.

I have tried turning off my heater, opening the windows, blasting my music, chewing gum, I almost always call my mom so she can help keep me awake.. Etc. these things help very little.

Most always I will pull over at some of my known exits for resting and I am instantly asleep once I park the car and put my seat back. I'll sleep for a half hour and then finish my drive. But like last night, I had to make a 1.5 hour drive to Minneapolis for a work meeting and I had just enough time to get there so I couldn't stop and sleep. I could have easily died driving or killed someone else last night the fatigue was so bad. 

The crazy thing is, as soon as I exited off the interstate and was back in regular speed traffic, the fatigue was almost completely gone. When I got to the seminar I was totally awake and fine. 

It seriously feels like a hypnosis I go into. I can feel it slowly creeping up on me and there is nothing I can do. 

If it helps at all, I have been sleep apnea tested and it came up negative. I also fall asleep when other people are driving and always have. When I was in the second grade I fell asleep on the bus home, missed my stop and ended up at the bus garage all alone and scared. Outside any vehicle I am very alert and not sleepy at all.

At this point I have researched online and came up with nothing. Friends and family tell me to chew gum and roll the window down. I wish that would work for me but it doesn't touch this trance I go into. I am so scared I am going to crash or hurt someone else. 

Until I can figure out a good solution I am just going to always plan ahead when driving so I can have enough time for naps along the way.
