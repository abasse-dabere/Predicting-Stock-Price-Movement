Health,Recurring yeast infections since April... help?,"Dear Reddit,

I have had recurring yeast infections since April. The OB/GYN I see has offered no truly useful advice or diagnosis, and with a storm approaching, I will likely be unable to schedule an appointment for a few days. I would be grateful for any advice or help reddit could offer.

Thank you in advance!


--------------------------------------

In late Dec. '09, I had a Paraguard IUD placed at Planned Parenthood. 
Every period after this became increasingly longer and heavier, with worse and worse cramps. By June, the cramps were so bad that I could not stand or walk, the bleeding was ridiculously heavy (I would wake up in pools of blood) and would last almost two weeks. I would have two mostly cramp-free, blood-free weeks before the excruciating pain of the next period began. 

However, the real trouble began in April, when I had my first yeast infection right before/during my period. Having never had one before, I didn't recognize it as such (It really just made it uncomfortable to use tampons.) It was left untreated and cleared up on its own. The same happened in May and resolved itself similarly. 

June, however, was absolutely terrible. The yeast infection started a week before the period (late June), and made it impossible to sit, walk, or use the bathroom comfortably. (This, combined with the cramps, caused for almost constant, terrible pain.) I went to Planned Parenthood to have the IUD removed and the infection looked at. The entire experience was absolutely terrible, and I left with the IUD and no medical advice whatsoever. I went to the ER a couple of hours later and was given a prescription for Clotromizole (two packs of 7-day treatments to be used together) and an antibiotic for a possible UTI. (Though I am dubious as to whether a UTI was present.) The yeast cleared up after the period. 

The infection repeated itself in July, and was treated with OTC treatments for yeast infections. The infection would clear up once the treatment was finished, but would promptly return within a few days. I had the IUD removed by an OB/GYN in early August, and was given a prescription for Diflucan and advised to use capsules of Boric acid for 7 days. Being without health insurance, I bought the boric acid and capsules, but didn't fill the prescription. (It's importance was not explained to me.) The boric acid was a veritable nightmare, and the infection responded as it did with the other treatments. 

I continued with OTC treatments until November, when I finally obtained health insurance and was able to see an OB/GYN without copay and minimal cost for prescriptions. I was given a prescription for 3 doses of Diflucan to be taken at three-day intervals. The OB/GYN also took a culture for yeast, which returned negative. The infection cleared up and didn't return until mid-January, right before my period, at which I returned to the hospital. I was given a single dose of Diflucan and had cultures for yeast and bacterial vaginosis taken. The doctor also requested a blood sugar and HIV test. All four tests returned negative. The yeast cleared up within about 12 hours of taking the Diflucan. 

I'm now two and a half weeks away from my period, and suddenly find myself with yet another yeast infection. 

I wear clean, loose, cotton underwear and loose-fitting pants. I shower regularly and use mild soap. I have never used a douche. I try to eat well, and don't consume large amounts of sugar. I use generic, unscented feminine products and toilet paper. I have a BMI of 25 and consider myself to be in good health. I am not diabetic, I do not have HIV, or any other serious health issues.

Health,I have had severe flourosis throughout my life and it's carried a lifelong stigma with me.  What can I do,"I don't know why, but from the time I was young I've had very, very severe flourosis.  My entire teeth are chipped and have yellow and brown stains.  Throughout my life I have had constant critisism (from as a kid rumors that I ate shit and that's what colored my teeth), to as an adult asking why I don't take of my teeth and people assuming I'm dirty because I don't take care of my teeth (I actually do take great care of my teeth, but nothing makes this coloring go away)

Recently I was in a relationship where my boyfriend told me my teeth made me look so ugly he was ashamed for me to meet his parents and wanted me to get oral surgery 


It really makes me feel like shit.  Recently a random stranger started talking to me and asked why I had flourosis (he was African and surprised to see it in an american)

Usually I don't care about appearance, but this really gets to me.  My teeth aren't something I can cover up.  How do I deal with this?  Or how do I get rid of it?  I have to stress my teeth are severely effected with this, and more than that I have a 3rd degree underbite which has gotten progressively worse throughout my life.  Aside from my teeth, I don't think I'm bad looking, but it's always the first thing anyone notices

EDIT:  Thanks for all of the responses.  A lot of people are suggesting getting surgery done in Asia.

Health,"Sporadically, my hands will swell and become mildly stiff and itchy. I have no idea why. Any guesses?","(nb: If there's a better subreddit that I can/should ask this in, let me know.)

This has been happening to me sporadically for at least a dozen years - my fingers and knuckles on one or both of my hands will visibly swell enough to disconcert whomever I show them to, and the tissue underneath the skin around my knuckles/between my fingers starts to feel rather stiff and itchy. As far as I can recollect, the common threads are that it happens when I'm kind of bored, it's uncomfortably warm, loud, and crowded in the room I'm in, and I've been standing up for an hour or two. 

I used to think it was some kind of an allergy to a wood or finish that I'd touched, but last weekend I was at a concert and I know I hadn't touched anything besides my girlfriend (whom I seem to otherwise not be allergic to). Anyway, holding onto something cold (usually a bottle of water or can of soda) will alleviate the severity of the symptoms, and it always goes away after fifteen minutes to a half hour by itself.

I suppose it's psychosomatic, but I'm not sure what exactly triggers it? (Possibly claustrophobia? Except I'm not particularly uncomfortable with crowds.) If anyone has any ideas or possible resources to help me explore this, since I haven't heard of this symptom anywhere else nor have I been able to Google it, shout it out.",19,7,2011-02-02,PHARMA,0.0800928920507431,0.8871423006057739,0.032764844596385956

Health,Hard lump on palm and unsteady blood pressure. Seeking diagnosis. (Photo),"http://i.imgur.com/8q9VX.jpg

About three weeks ago, I got this lump appearing in my palm where it used to be just a normal looking purple blood vessel. It is pretty solid hard to the touch. But occasional it flattens and disappears completely. In fact just as I am typing this, I checked on it, it is gone! But most of the times it is there. Ah there, it is back now..
What is worrying me the most is that I can feel blood pressure in my left arm going up and down as the lump comes and goes. Also I can't sleep on my RIGHT side, and I can't curl my left arm fully without the arm going numb within a few seconds. Also I think I get moments of stress on my heart just sitting or lying down every few minutes.

I've made an appointment with my doctor in a few days time. But after browsing the r/Health reddit for a while, I fear that I might die of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome if don't do something about it very soon. Anyway got any ideas?

medicine,"Meddit, how do you deal with having a sick or dying family member, as a healthcare provider?","My grandfather is in hospital right now following a femur frx. He has cirrhosis, ascites, low clotting factors, etc. He lost a lot of blood during the repair, his BP dropped, and his lungs were wet.

All this, and I still can't bring myself to visit him, because I keep thinking about it from a medical standpoint. I don't know how to have the bad news broken to me, instead of breaking the bad news to someone else. 

How do you flip the switch?

Update: He had 3 BPs over 100 but he had to be changed. He has a hip frx so it's pretty painful, and the morphine kicked it back down to mid 80s. He's still a bit tachy, but the over 130 alarm hasn't been going off as often. He's 90-100 most of the time.

He's altered, but he said my name when he last woke up.

Update 2: His BP leveled out in the 110's before I left him shortly after midnight. His heart rate is also back down to normal. After jumping around from 100 to 145 all night, he skipped a beat, dropped into the 50's, I did what any good emergency medicine person does and abandoned prayer in favor of swearing at the monitor and threatening it and it's family. As always, after telling it that I would kill the entire Phillips family, he converted to a normal rhythm (cardiologists, take note).

He's still altered, but he's been stringing together complete and mostly appropriate sentences, and knew who I was, so it's mostly just opiate induced. He knows where he is, and that he was pretty sick for a while, because he asked the nurse if he doing any better. Short term memory is still a bit foggy, but the nurse told him her name and he was able to repeat it a few minutes later. He can't remember the tech's name, but he's hard of hearing, and accents make it difficult for him to understand.

The worst part of the night was when I had to leave. You could tell he wanted to say something, but the drugs weren't letting him. He got upset when he couldn't lift his arms high enough to hug me, and I just had to walk out. I managed to not cry the entire time, and right then and there was the closest I came to losing it.

I've always been that stubborn bastard who you know loves you, but never actually says it. Tonight I finally broke that streak.

Update 3: I just got off the phone with my grandmother just now. BP is still up, ammonia is down, and he remembered that I saw him yesterday. He's not as foggy either.

I have to be at my own hospital tomorrow, but I only have a half shift on Tuesday, so I'll hop on the highway and drive two counties over to sit in intermediate care for a few hours before I have to head back in for Wednesday's shift.

**UPDATE 4**: I don't know if anyone is checking this anymore, but I felt the need to go ahead and put the final update, just in case. My grandfather's ammonia spiked again that Tuesday, so when I went to visit him, I found out he was already in hospice. Several doses and Haldol, Ativan, Methadone, and Morphine later, he passed on February 18 at 2215.

I had just gotten off a long shift, and didn't have the energy to make it there, but my mother sat by his bedside, and pronounced him herself.

Given the amount of time we had to prepare, and how many times during that week we had seen our family, we decided to forgo any sort of funeral.

I followed doctor's orders and lost weight (over 100 lbs) but it didn't go away. Over the past year, it has progressed to what is considered stage 3. I have had the worst flare ups with major cyss and abscesses in my labial tissues and groin area. 

I am discouraged. No doctors in my area have any idea what to do other than treat the cysts as they occur. I have tried losing more weight, I have tried zinc supplements, I have tried hormone therapy but nothing. I don't know what to do anymore. There are times the pain is so bad I can't sit, I need to lay on my stomach for relief. It affects my schooling, my sex life. 

Does anyone here suffer from this? Do you know anyone who does? I feel so alone.",20,18,2011-02-13,PHARMA,0.1931924670934677,0.779725193977356,0.027082325890660286

Health,Why Does Eating do this to Me?,"A little background.  I'm a 21 year old male.  I am about 5'9"" 125 lbs.  Don't smoke anymore (its been 8 months :) ) and have never had any serious health problems.

Anyway I have noticed that everytime I eat a big meal my heart goes all crazy.  It generally seems to happen after a big meal, especially so if I haven't eaten in a while.  Basically my heart just starts beating like crazy about 30 mins following the meal.  Its not necessairly beating ridiculously fast, though it is quite fast, but it pounds and just doesn't feel like its beating properly.  Like something is off, it is accompanied by a tightness in the chest and sort of woozy feeling.

This scared me so a few weeks ago I had some cardiac work done up.  I am in the peak of health.  They did an echo, an ekg, and I wore an event monitor for two weeks.  Nothing was wrong.

I carried around a blood glucose monitor (in the case it was diabetes or reactive hypoglycemia.  But everytime I check it my blood sugar levels are right around 100, perfect for me.

medicine,Please help me diagnose my condition!,"* Last week, I woke up with 3 bug bites in the middle of the winter even though I slept fully clothed
* Each morning since then, I found a new bug bite
* In order to rule out the possibility of bed bugs or bugs in my room, I slept over my boyfriend's and alternated but to no avail
* I washed all my clothes but still the same thing every morning
* All these ""bug bites"" are on my right leg from my ankle to my knee--nowhere else. 
* Currently, I have 13 and counting. 
* The first 3 bug bites are becoming reduced in terms of itchiness and swelling but is still very red. 

I can deal with a couple of bug bites but 13 just between my ankle and knee is massive and starting to itch just one of the bites starts a chain reaction of this urgency to itch all of them. 

I'm pretty sure that this isn't a case of the bed bugs because it's so localized and my boyfriend isn't affected at all. Also, since it keeps popping up one by one each morning.

As some of you know, this subreddit does have a few healthcare providers reading who respond to threads. This is great, but though we may have qualifications, we can't diagnose you. Using the web to research your condition and your treatment is good, and I suggest it, but posting symptoms looking for an answer isn't.


Really, all we can do is provide suggestions, without you actually physically presenting to us, we have no way to know. A lot of these types of posts are benign, but there are some where people describe symptoms that could be caused by a medical emergency. So, do you have severe pain with a sudden onset? Go to your doctor or a hospital. Nothing posted on this website(the same for MOST websites) should be considered medical advice. EVER.

Health,Popeye the Sailor Man was based on a faulty calculation ...,"The cartoon character Popeye the Sailor Man is portrayed as having a strong affinity for spinach, becoming physically stronger after consuming it. A frequently circulated story claims that this portrayal was based on faulty calculations of the iron content.[19][20][21] In the story, German scientist E. von Wolf misplaced a decimal point in an 1870 measurement of spinach's iron content, leading to an iron value 10 times higher than it should have been. This faulty measurement was not noticed until the 1930s.

Health,Magic Mushrooms cured my dad's cluster headaches.,"For those that don't know cluster headaches are similar to migraines and are either episodic, occurring for a period ranging from weeks to months, or chronic. The pain is so severe that many sufferers, particularly those with a chronic condition, are driven to suicide earning them the nickname ""suicide headaches"".

My dad's headaches thankfully are of the episodic variety. He had been going through a cycle starting around October, pain rated at 7-9 on his personal pain scale, and he's a tough guy, multiple times a day everyday. Individual headaches could be stopped using pharmaceuticals that cost around 10-15$ a pop, but his insurance was running out and he had began to ration them.

This was December and I decided to do some research on the topic. I found this paper.

http://www.hodepinelidelser.no/forum/index.php?topic=46.0 

He was skeptical but after a few more days of suffering decided to give it a try.

He took 4 doses spread over 3 weeks ranging from .5 grams to 1 gram. After the first dose the frequency of the headaches went down about 25% and the pain went from 7-9 to 4-5. Both dropped more after the 2nd and 3rd dose and now it's been over a month since the 4th dose and he has been pain free since.

Also interesting is that he occasionally has irregular heartbeats that become more frequent during an episode. He has not noticed one since taking the first dose.

My dad tried shrooms once in the early 70's but is definitely not a drug enthusiast in any way. He is pretty confident that it was the shrooms and not just a coincidence. Of course this is anecdotal but there is an entire online community that has had a similar experience and swears by their unconventional cure. Google cluster busters for more information.

TL;DR: $30 dollars worth of shrooms were more effective then over $1000 worth of prescriptions.

Edit: I am not a doctor and do not recommend trying this without further research and consulting with a doctor. My dad has a good relationship with his doctor, showed him the paper, and had him inform him of the risks involved.",47,77,2011-02-21,PHARMA,0.19151543080806732,0.7790249586105347,0.029459573328495026

medicine,"What are the implications of AI like Watson on the 
future of medicine?","In case any of you are unaware, Watson is a computer designed by IBM which has the capability of interpreting natural human language in order to retrieve answers. In a recent competition on Jeopardy, the computer defeated two of the world's best Jeopardy players by a hefty margin.

In a video, posted [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiG9hfmqTHQ&amp;feature=player_embedded), the general manager of IBM stated that one of the obvious applications of a program like this is to medicine. With an insurmountable number of new articles published in journals each year, it seems that a program like this would have a huge advantage over humans in keeping up and finding relevant studies, etc. 

With Moore's law in mind, a Watson-like medical program will be able to run on a normal desktop within the decade (and likely sooner, even on smartphones/tablet, due to cloud computing).

Concurrently, [robotic surgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_surgery) is beginning to take off on a limited scale. 

The question that I wonder is: what is the future of medicine twenty or thirty years from now?

I am currently a graduating undergrad that is interested in a medical career, but Watson has me a bit apprehensive. Is it foolish to think that private industry will trump doctors in providing the best healthcare in the future (essentially making traditional doctors obsolete)?


TLDR: Computers are getting faster and smarter. Future iterations of Watson may be capable of diagnosis and future versions of surgical robots may be capable of autonomous surgeries. What implications does this have for those like myself who are just beginning their journey into medicine?",13,8,2011-02-21,PHARMA,0.027187969535589218,0.9224935173988342,0.05031856894493103

The reason I think to look at these as symptoms of hypothyroidism is because my mother has been diagnosed with thyroid issues in her life and is now on medication for it... for life :|

Health,Take a Survey to Help Biomedical Research!,"Hey /r/Health,

I work for Expinions, a research group at the University of Chicago. We study biomedical research using patient experiences, interviews with experts, and examining publications. 

This is a link to a survey for patients who have had MRSA, Colon Cancer, Breast Cancer, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, or Leukemia. If you could up-vote and/or send it to people you know who might have had these disorders, it would be really helpful to our research.

Health,Bad experiences with blood donations- what causes this?,"I've donated blood 4x in my life as of today and I have a terrible time when doing so. I'm wondering if I have a condition that should be further looked into based on these symptoms: moments after being attached to the bag I want to pass out, which I assume is due to a sudden drop in bp.  

If I'm not given wet towels and my feet aren't elevated I'll be out completely.  If I can pull through and get some water, within a couple minutes both of my arms will go numb and tingle and I will have chills throughout and shortly after the donation - entire body shivering, teeth chattering, etc. regardless of the room temperature.  When I say numb I don't mean your typical pins and needles lack of circulation, it's more of a combination with feeling practically hypothermic, but only my arms get tingly.

I'll also be breathing hard to keep myself conscious, and the entire process in general is borderline painful.  Based on reactions around me (I'm sure I scared any newbie donors nearby) this is not normal and I was wondering if anyone would have advice as to what might cause such a severe reaction? I wouldn't call myself hemophobic either, and I would like to be able to keep donating blood on a regular basis.

**tl:dr; If I don't faint within 30 seconds of a blood donation I will be shivering uncontrollably and loose feeling/be tingly but not pins and needles in both arms. Breathing is labored as well - what underlying condition might cause such a reaction?  I don't consider myself hemophobic.**",5,7,2011-02-26,PHARMA,0.08982450515031815,0.8860828280448914,0.024092698469758034
Health,Coke vs Pepsi: A health question,"I've recently noticed a few health issues lately that I've tied to my over-drinking of Coke, purely because I get a free supply at work. I've not touched it in two and a half weeks now, but a question arises; do other cola brands, such as Pepsi, for example, cause similar health issues, or would they be ""safe"" to drink, as such?

I haven't seen a doctor yet but I have been feeling better of late; eagerly awaiting caffeine withdrawal though. :3

Some of the health issues, because of the asks, have mostly been related to an over-abundance of sugars and caffeine in my system, as at one point I was on one-to-two litres a night and about six pints on fridays. I was constantly thirsty, wanting or nearly needing a drink not long after finishing my last one. I pegged the issue to my constant coke drinking as it was really the only high-sugar drink I was consuming.",10,5,2011-02-26,PHARMA,0.054128002375364304,0.9038391709327698,0.04203282669186592
Health,"I'm afraid I'm going to have a heart attack, but I'm only 23.  Am I being paranoid?","About a year and a half ago I started developing heart palpitations.  My heart would race randomly, very fast to the point I would feel likee I was about to pass out.  It always felt surprisingly good, someone point out this can happen because your oxygen supply is getting cut off which can feel euphoric.  These episodes usually lasted no more than a minute or so and would happen anywhere from every day to every couple weeks.  I don't do anything to stop them, they just stop naturally.  That has settled down and it occurs less frequently but in the last 6 months or so I get really weird heart pains.  It just pains in my heart on occasion, it's doing it right now as I write this.  When I would young I would get ""chest pains"" or what I learned was precordial catch, which is normal, but this is totally different.  This is just like a lingering pain in my heart that will be there for a good 10 minutes or so.  It's not excruciating, more just I can ""feel my heart"" if that makes sense and I'm very aware of my heart?  Happened yesterday after a hard workout, I came home, the heart pain hit me so bad once I got inside for a second I thought I was having a heart attack

I am getting very worried.  Sometimes I have dreams I'm having a heart attack and I can feel that pain greatly, and I assume it's because I'm getting the pain while I'm asleep and that's how I'm manifesting it in my dreams.  Anyway, I am worried that this is really a possibility :(

When I went to my doctor he just laughed and was like ""don't drink caffeine, you are obviously sensitive to it!""  I feel it's more than that but i'm no doctor so I don't know

EDIT:  I eat healthy, I am a very healthy weight, I don't drink or smoke or use any recreational drugs at all.  

EDIT2:  Damn it, even right now this pain is very bad :(  It just comes and goes, in and out, in and out, like it's getting larger and smaller and it's like I can hear it

EDIT3:  I will also add that I did stupidly subject myself to massive sleep deprivation for about a 4 year period before this started happening.  I would routinely stay awake for 48 or 50 hour straight periods about twice a week, and would go weeks where i would sleep about 3 or 4 hours a night.  After all this heart stuff started happening I was really unable to maintain this ""lifestyle"" any longer",13,3,2011-02-26,PHARMA,0.10827170312404633,0.8612096905708313,0.030518580228090286

* The risk of symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis has been frequently shown to be reduced by smokers on a dose-dependent basis; the effect is eliminated if the individual stops smoking.

Consequences:

* The risk of dying from lung cancer before age 85 is 22.1% for a male smoker and 11.9% for a female smoker, in the absence of competing causes of death. The corresponding estimates for lifelong nonsmokers are a 1.1% probability of dying from lung cancer before age 85 for a man of European descent, and a 0.8% probability for a woman.
* Male and female smokers lose an average of 13.2 and 14.5 years of life, respectively.
* Prior to World War I, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease, which most physicians would never see during their career. With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking, however, came an epidemic of lung cancer.
* Smokers report higher levels of everyday stress. Several studies have monitored feelings of stress over time and found reduced stress after quitting.
* A number of studies have shown that tobacco use is a significant factor in miscarriages among pregnant smokers, and that it contributes to a number of other threats to the health of the fetus. Second-hand smoke appears to present an equal danger to the fetus, as one study noted that ""heavy paternal smoking increased the risk of early pregnancy loss.""
