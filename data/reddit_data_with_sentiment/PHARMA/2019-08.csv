medicine,I‚Äôm not in medicine but I wanted to say that I appreciate you all and I thank you for all you do.,"My mom had a health scare this past weekend. She‚Äôs totally fine. But me and my family felt very scared and vulnerable at the time as we didn‚Äôt know what was wrong and it was upsetting to see someone we love so much in a vulnerable state. 

Let me tell you, the dedication and service I saw starting from the nurse checking in patients at the emergency room that pushed my mother to the top of the waiting list, to the ER doctors, nurses, and the people that are up late at night caring for people they have no relationship with. To the sheer amount of medical knowledge that they are recalling, the communication skills, the system...everything. It meant a lot. 

I just wanted to thank you all for all you do. Your service, your sacrifice, and the effort you all make on a daily basis. I don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôd be without you all. 

(And yes, I did thank the people that helped us profusely, just extending the appreciation here on Reddit)

Edit: my first gold! Thank you kind stranger! I truly meant every word I said and it warmed my heart that I made so many peoples day by just making a simple text post on Reddit. It also reinforces just how much you all are under appreciated. I will do my small part and to try and remind others of that and to be thankful to all medical practitioners when you can.

biotech,Research Practice Better in Industry than in Academia?,"Since I have done about 1,5 years worth of basic research in different labs in academia to pursue my goal of being a Professor I have realized that the academic doctrine of critical/safe/perfectionistic thinking that I thought I would experience (and learn) is not really present.

Especially in the sciences that are not close to application, it seem to be more important to convey a significant breakthrough than to create sound knowledge that is true in many scenarios; that one can base new research on. 

I think this is because of the following: In academia, publications are the product that gives you profit (better grants). Publications only have to be true in the presented data. They don‚Äòt have to be true for, let‚Äòs say, other laboratories, different mouse strains, different experimental approaches supposedly leading to the same result. In short: Real scrutiny of replicability is not possible. Hence, the high-impact Professors that I have worked with so far seem to be more of a great, creative marketer and collaborator who can sell the storyline well.

In industry however, there is the ultimate test of truth (replicability): Costly pre-clinical and clinical trials. When a drug candidate isn‚Äòt very sure to work in a significant amount of the population, it will cause huge financial consequences for the company, maybe even bankrupcy. So scientific truth/replicability must be of higher value to a pharma company than to basic academic science. Hence the research practice standards (sound experimental design, much repetition, hygiene etc.) in a pharma company must be much higher than in academia. 

Can any insiders support this hypothetical statement? I have never worked in a pharma company, which is why I I don‚Äòt know if that‚Äòs true. If it‚Äòs true, I might definitely try to change to industry and will trade in some academic freedom for that. It‚Äòs not a great imagination to think to be a great scientist in academia, when the greatest scientists are in industry.",14,41,2019-08-02,PHARMA,0.036544036120176315,0.9319978356361389,0.03145807608962059

I want to bring up and discuss the incredibly annoying moment, when you get a beautiful flashback, hold the introducer needle as steady as a rock, slowly pass the guidewire in, and with a great sigh of exasparation you are met with solid resistance.

Today, whilst inserting an arterial line despite getting a wonderfully free flowing pulastion of arterial blood all over the floor, the guidewire just would not go in, no matter how hard I negotiated. I tried in multiple locations including brachial and femoral, and was met with the exact same fate. An ultrasound also clearly showed the needle tip right in the middle of the vessel, not brushing against the wall/at a tortous part of the artery. After conceding and getting the boss to give it a go, they too had the exact same issue, despite trying both brachials, and femorals.

I have asked quite a few colleagues and seniors, and nobody seems to be able to give an adequete explanation. Possibilities are increased calcification/atherosclerosis of the vessel, or even blaming the cheap guidewires that our department use. Searching online hasn't given me much insight either.

medicine,DOCTORS: I'd like to pay it forward,"Me and wife just had a recent experience with a doctor who we consider saved her life. She was feeling terrible pains in her abdomen so we went to see a public doctor, where they told her she had an inflamed intestine; take this shot and take better care is what was prescribed. Prior to seeing the doctor we were the ‚Äògoogle detectives‚Äô who thought we could find a diagnosis over the internet. We were worried she might have gallstones (even though the pain was on the wrong side), and that she might need to be operated. We asked the public doctor if it could be gallstones and she said no, it wasn‚Äôt that. So we left the office pretty relieved. However, 1 day later her pains didn‚Äôt get any better and we started to doubt the doctors diagnosis. A friend recommended a doctor by name, but had lost their phone number. Like the detectives we were, we went to the internet to try and find their contact information, and we did, sort of. We found their website through a directory (with out of date contact information listed), and their phone number wasn‚Äôt listed on the website, so we wrote them an email and reached out on facebook. We waited 24 hours but never got a response, so we decided to go with a different doctor and got an appointment the same day. Immediately was told that she needed an ultrasound and was quickly confirmed to have gallstones. Dang‚Ä¶ They told us if we waited any longer that it could have caused an infection and serious complications or death, and that she needed an operation to remove the stones. Great‚Ä¶ Just what she wanted to hear.. Not. Anyway, we checked her into the public hospital with an emergency status from the doctor, and the surgery was done 2 days later. Recovery was pretty rough, but successful. Thankfully we had the intuition to get a second opinion, and not wait for the second doctor to reply. A couple days into recovery we actually got an email reply from the ‚Äòother‚Äô doctor saying they could schedule an appointment, and to call their office because email replies can be slow (you don‚Äôt say).

This experience made me realize just how important it is to keep a website up to date, with contact information at your fingertips. I feel like I could have lost my wife if we had relied on the ‚Äòother‚Äô doctor to reply. If their phone number was listed, we could have called and seen a doctor sooner. So that‚Äôs why I came to this community; I do web/graphic design for a living and want to pay it forward. I want to offer a free website evaluation if you‚Äôre a doctor and have a website. I‚Äôll take a look at your website with my check list and give you feedback on what is missing, or what can be improved, you can do with that information as you please! Maybe it can help a different family in the future.

Today I fielded a great call from one of our *favorite* patients. Basically this patient is always very unpleasant, and often rude. Turns out, this is not exclusive to the pharmacy, as she called her doctor an asshole, and got a letter that they have 30 days to find a new doctor.

I got dragged into this, because hindsight is 20/20 and they were in a panic about where they get their prescriptions from during transition. Basically they had no refills on any RX‚Äôs, so I tell them they have to call the doctor and ask for a hold-over prescription, or find a new doctor willing to write them one prescription before their visit. Pretty standard right? I can‚Äôt make a script appear out of thin air, especially when you‚Äôve been kicked out of your doctors office.

medicine,"Cardiologists/EM docs/all others of meddit, curious regarding your opinions on a case","To give you the setting, a few weeks ago I‚Äôm working in a rural ER I work at occasionally. 2 hours from nearest hospital. It is pretty well stocked, although only with common medications used in an ER. It‚Äôs actually quite busy and have about 12 active patients, 5 of them are in the process of getting transferred, 3 of them to an ICU. Just as I am starting to relax, two new patients check in within a minute of one another. I get called to triage about one of them who is a gentleman that is diaphoretic, hypotensive, jaundiced, and his testicles are swollen (he is not who this case is about). I have him rushed back so we can resuscitate him immediately as it becomes obvious this guy has Fournier‚Äôs Gangrene and needs to get transferred out now. Meanwhile the second patient to check in gets sent to a room in the back and is being handled by a new nurse as the others are helping resuscitate the other gentleman who is actively trying to die. I get handed an ECG, rate of 148 which is the same rate of my Fournier‚Äôs guy, so I just briefly glance at it while I‚Äôm putting in orders and assumed that ECG was for him. Probably about 25 minutes after both those patients check in, I go to check on the second guy however, he is in XR (I had put in some cursory orders as I knew I would be held up with the first guy). I get a few calls from surgeons and intesivists and hospitalists about coordinating care for my guy with Fournier‚Äôs so it is another 20 minutes before I go back to check on the second patient.

When I walk in I find a 50-something year old gentleman who is diaphoretic, severely tachypneic, and tripoding. His HR is 150, he is sating 87% on 6L NC, BP is 170/110. He is afebrile. Has diffuse crackles on lung auscultation. He apparently has no medical history. He had been having SOB for a few days and it significantly worsened that evening. I quickly put him on bipap, give him a couple SL nitros and go find his ECG and realize that ECG with a rate of 148 is his. It‚Äôs regular, axis normal, intervals are normal, no evidence of ischemia, but p-waves are upright in aVR and V1, and inverted in all other leads. My first thought is obviously 2:1 flutter with buried p-waves in the QRS complex. I am now questioning whether to rate control someone that is in new onset heart failure as the classic teaching is to avoid BB in acute heart failure exacerbations (not quite sure on the evidence behind this), however, it is also recommended to avoid CCB in patients with systolic heart failure. I use our very outdated bedside US to find the patient has an EF of likely somewhere around 15-20%. 

So I find myself in a predicament. It is possible that the patient‚Äôs HF is due to their tachydysrhythmia vs causing it. Also, is this patient in and out of flutter/fib? His symptoms have been going on for greater than 5 days. What would you do? I thought the best answer would be synchronized cardioversion, however, the patient and wife adamantly refused it further complicating issues. The only med I had for chemical cardioversion was amiodarone, which I don‚Äôt typically use due to the cardiologists and intensvists at the receiving hospital where I also work not typically liking amio. So I am back to BB vs CCB vs do nothing and hope for the best. I end up giving a half dose of diltiazem which brings his rate down to 125. I get a repeat ECG that shows that what I thought was a-flutter was actually a unifocal atrial tachycardia. The patient now looks much better, although probably more due to the bipap. I call the cardiologist at the facility accepting him and they recommend holding off on additional meds and they‚Äôll figure it out when he arrives. The patient then ends up converting to NSR as he is about to be transferred a few hours later.

So how would y‚Äôall handle this case? I thought it would be interesting to hear varying opinions.

pharmacy,Sunlight is the best disinfectant: Transparency can shame the chains into doing the right thing.,"Every state has a board of pharmacy. The boards should rate each pharmacy and give them a letter rating of A through F and mandate that the safety grade be posted at the store entrance and near the pharmacy dropoff and pickup areas.

This isn't a crazy idea. In many states, all restaurants have to display a grade at the entrance, and many people will avoid restaurants with anything less than and A rating.

So what should the metric be for safety? Prescriptions sold per pharmacist hour. We all know that with increased rx volume, less time is available to spend on each patient, resulting in errors and other suboptimal outcomes.

 Here's a proposed grading scale:

A - max 30 rx per pharmacist hour

B - max 40 rx per pharmacist hour

C - max 60 RX per pharmacist hour

F - &gt;60 rx per hour


The calculation should be simple. The board could request the number of rxs and the number of pharmacist hours for the previous year. The safety grade would be good for one year.

medicine,Cardiologists/Electrophysiologits - BrS case thoughts?,"Placed in cardiology recently and saw a patient / situation that I found interesting, details have been changed for confidentiality.

Young male diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome in their early teens presented to clinic for an assessment after referral. After exhausting other medications the referrer has requested a review to determine whether it would be safe to start him on another medication (stimulant class, but is not on the list of drugs to ~~preferably~~ avoid for BrS) - the patient seemed more concerned with it disrupting his ability to apply to his desired career. Patient reported no history of palpitations or light headedness since adolescence, and had never reported nor been admitted for any syncopal event. HR in 80s and normotensive, cardiovascular exam insignificant but basal ECG did have RBBB.

I looked at his notes during &amp; after the consultation and noted that they had previously undergone surgery to implant a loop recorder which was in for \~1 year post-diagnosis. Loop recorder documented no significant/relevant arrhythmia, even during self-reported event times and when the patient presented to ED with light headedness. In summary: they had no documented arrhythmia, no FH of SUDS, family was tested and had no Brugada-like ECG pattern, no episodes of syncope, no genetic testing had been done and they had never undergone ventricular arrhythmia provocation studies. The only diagnostic criteria they met was the appearance of Type 1 ST segment elevation on Ajmaline challenge (no occurrence of VT, QRS prolongation or PVCs).

Say what you will, and believe that ""at least they get to keep their training position"", however, positions for actual people, training physicians, *are being sold at auction.*    

And for some inside information to those outside whats happening on behalf of those who are prohibited from revealing information as to how local programs are handling the loss of 30-50 residents per institution:

Abington-Jefferson hospital alone lost ~44 residents.  They are being supplemented by Attendings from Jefferson Hospital, AND any Jefferson Network physician in the local area HAS to do at least one 6 hours shift at Abington-Jefferson.  So far, this is not going well. Some Attendings in this mess are so overwhelmed that they are threatening to hand off their patients and leave.  Additional people are needed to literally follow around and help Attendings just to enter Pharmacy orders to prevent mistakes and triple the workload.  

There is no active plan in place for the next year for back filling these slots, and there will be no increases in any Pharmacy positions or residency positions either.  

Several ""Sentinel Events"" have occurred during this transition between the major Philadelphia hospitals affected by this.  

And finally word from the inside is trickling out that this might be a fantastic template to use for a Residency strike.  Several hospitals are almost internally crippled, and with no solid long-term contingency plan for something of this magnitude, a well-timed strike of Residents could devastate a system to the point of near insolvency.

pharmacy,"I actually saw it! The arrogant customer who said they didn‚Äôt NEED to give their info to pick up their pain meds. Bonus: They‚Äôre going to corporate!!! (Long post ahead, but hopefully one everyone of y‚Äôall will appreciate. Sorry!)","Ok, so full disclosure... I‚Äôm not in pharmacy/healthcare. Just a patient who thinks y‚Äôall are neat. Also, this is a long one, but if I left anything out I wouldn‚Äôt be giving you all the full truth, so I‚Äôm sorry for the essay below. 

So about an hour or so ago I was at the Walmart about a block and a half from my house picking up an emergency Rx for my mom. I‚Äôm waiting in line approx 10 ft away from the pick up divider (ya know like halls signs ask us to do) while this guy and his wife were doing their thing. They‚Äôre probably late 20‚Äôs/early 30‚Äôs. By all accounts normal looking people. 

So the wonderfully polite woman working the register/pickup requests the name of the patient. Que homeboy giving his first name only in the most asshole-ish tone possible. So the kind tech (who has that sort of sweetheart grandmother type demeanor) requests his last name. ‚ÄúWhy the fuck would you need that?!‚Äù ‚ÄúI never have to give my last name, you should know who I am!‚Äù The tech responds; ‚ÄúSir, there are other patients here. I need to ask if you‚Äôd please lower your voice and not use profanity.‚Äù 
Homeboy is ENRAGED at the audacity of this woman to speak to him this this manner. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what did you just say to me?!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do and speak however I goddamn well please!‚Äù Tech who leveled up: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right sir. I‚Äôm very sorry. Unfortunately, my system is pretty old. So I need your full name and DOB. I realize this is unacceptable service, but unfortunately it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got to work with. I‚Äôm SO sorry!‚Äù Air homeboy literally throwing (what I assume was) his drivers license at her face (seriously directly at this woman‚Äôs face! You believe that shit????!) 

So at this point the tech working with the pharmacist, the drive through tech and the (amazing) pharmacist herself stop everything. The pharmacist removed her white coat, put on the green Walmart vest and went over to the pick up counter. She didn‚Äôt say anything. Just stood there. 

Now that wonderful tech has all the info she needs it turns out homeboy is there to pick up Norco/Soma/Ativan. At this point, the lovely pharmacist smiles, taps the tech on the shoulder and says ‚Äúmind if I take over from here?‚Äù Tech: ‚ÄúSure thing boss!‚Äù

Pharmacist: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the bad experience Mr.Jackass. We didn‚Äôt meet your expectations this time and because of that we failed to live up to our standards. I‚Äôll have my tech call a manager to the pharmacy and see if I can‚Äôt get you a gift card for the trouble we caused you. However, I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt be able to fill these prescriptions for you. The FDA and DEA have recently put out new guidelines stating there is no therapeutic reason for this particular combination of meds. It‚Äôs my job and moral and ethical obligation to keep you safe. If you‚Äôd like I‚Äôd be happy to fill ONE of these Rx‚Äôs for you, but there‚Äôs no chance of all three.‚Äù 

At this point the manager has arrived at the pharmacy (with almost perfect timing) to overhear 80% of the pharmacists logic. 

Homeboy: My doctor wrote these prescriptions!!!! You have no goddamn right to refuse them to me. I swear to god if ALL of my Rx‚Äôs aren‚Äôt ready in less than 3 (or however many he actually said) minutes, not only am I going to corporate to report you but I‚Äôm gonna have you investigated and make sure your license is stripped from you!‚Äù 

In what can only be described as a power move on the part of the pharmacist: ‚ÄúWell sir I‚Äôve already made my decision. And in addition to the justifications I‚Äôve already explained, I‚Äôm going to go ahead and add drug seeking behavior to them. So with that said, as you can see my store manager is right here. She‚Äôs overheard most of this so far. But I want to make sure you‚Äôre able to give her your side in its entirety. Also, while you‚Äôre speaking with her, I‚Äôll go ahead and look up my corporate offices phone number along with the number to the BOP who ultimately decided my fate in these matters‚Äù ‚ÄúI understand you‚Äôre upset with me and my pharmacy right now. However, that gives you absolutely no right to abuse my staff, threaten all of us and exhibit the kind of behavior you have this morning. As you might not be aware of the laws regarding controlled substances I want to be as open and honest as possible. At least one of your Rx‚Äôs is what we in the industry call a ‚ÄòC2‚Äô. The rules around these medications are incredibly strict. I have absolutely no ability to disregard the rules and laws surrounding them. So because of this, I am unable to transfer any of these to another pharmacy and frankly even if I were allowed, I‚Äôd make sure to make whatever pharmacy you chose aware of your behavior here today and they‚Äôd almost assuredly take the position I‚Äôve taken this morning. Furthermore, I‚Äôll be calling the prescribed at the first opportunity to make them aware of your actions as well.‚Äù And I swear to god with the most perfect ‚Äúfuck you you worthless sack of shit, kill them with kindness demeanor I‚Äôve EVER seen‚Äù; Pharmacist: Now sir, is there anything else I can assist you with this morning? Otherwise you taken up about 30 minutes of my pharmacies time, made all these other people wait much longer than they deserved to and frankly I‚Äôve more important things to do than continue this conversation.‚Äù 

The manager then requests the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù follow her to the front to lodge his ‚Äúformal‚Äù complaint and hopefully throw his ass out. At some point during the confrontation the wife had wandered off, presumably out of her embarrassment. So I‚Äôve no idea where she is in opinion about this situation. I assume she went to die by locking herself in their car in the 102 degree heat after having been associated with this tantrum in public. 

Almost unbelievably, after this the entire staff of the pharmacy went right back to business as usual, which, my god the professionalism on those women is just insane! They called me forward after this. I apologized for them having to deal with that, confessed I‚Äôd moved as close as I could after shit hit the fan to get the details and apologized for breaking the ‚Äúwait here for patient privacy sign‚Äù. Wonderful pharm tech was adamant that I DESERVED the apology for being witness to it. You believe that?? She apologized to ME.  After everything she was subjected to. Talk about amazing service, while being forced to deal with a backlog of work now, having a like of 12-15 people at that point while being understaffed!!! LITERALLY INCREDIBLE! They even offered us ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù who watched it all a 15 dollar gift card.  


Even further disclosures: Obviously, I haven‚Äôt recalled literally EVERY word each person used (even though I used quotes), while I was quite a bit further behind the privacy sign than needed, once the shit went down, I kept scooting closer and closer to make sure I got to see ALL the drama. The pharmacist on duty today was the pharmacy manager, which is why I assume she had bigger balls than any man and didn‚Äôt give a flying rats ass about this homeboy ranting (side note: this pharmacist is one of those who knows her patients, always takes a moment to say hello when she sees them... just an all around amazing professional). I‚Äôve exaggerated the story JUST A BIT, but I swear on everything I‚Äôve not made up any details.  

I asked the pharmacist if I could get them all a snack or drink or something to hopefully help them have a better day. She, being a beacon of professionalism kindly refused my offer. But I couldn‚Äôt not do something so I got them a thing of cupcakes from the bakery and a 10 dollar gift card to buy their drink of choice. I hope they accept this because holy shit if anyone deserves it, they do. 

I know that retail can be absolute hell 99% of the time. And it really bothers me to know that the people who take such amazing care of my mother have to deal with it. Which is why I felt obligated with the drinks and cupcakes. Anyway, I thought if there‚Äôs anyone who would appreciated the brass balls on that pharmacy team, it‚Äôd be y‚Äôall. Apologies for taking up so much of your time. 

Hope you all have a good shift with customers/patients who understand the burdens on your shoulders and no funny business to weed out on the controls. And lastly, thanks y‚Äôall. Genuinely. You keep us alive, safe, run interference for us with insurance and doctors and still somehow managed not to lose your humanity.


Edit # whatever at this point. While I‚Äôm grateful for the karma y‚Äôall have given me, please don‚Äôt upvote me further on this. I‚Äôm not trying to be a white knight to the profession in anyway. Like I said at the top, I simply thing that y‚Äôall (and doctors) are just neat. I‚Äôm no where near as smart as even the shittiest tech or worst doctor. Otherwise I‚Äôd pursue a healthcare career. So again, thank you for the upvotes. However, most seem to be split on how much (if any) I‚Äôm lying about. Downvoted (if you feel so inclined) go to town.

pharmacy,APhA‚Äôs National Consensus Conference on Pharmacist Well-Being,"**Disclaimer**: I am not a member of APhA, nor was I affiliated in any way with this document or the consensus conference. I was simply surprised by the contents of the report/recommendations and wanted to share.

Report available [here]( https://www.pharmacist.com/enhancing-well-being-and-resilience-among-pharmacist-workforce-national-consensus-conference)

In the last few months, Brad Tice, current president of APhA, commented on several threads on this subreddit. In one of those comments, he indicated that APhA was engaging in a larger conference with other stakeholders to discuss issues in pharmacy, including going beyond provider status to discuss issues with PBMs, reimbursement, metrics, and other challenges facing pharmacists. Last week, [a report on consensus recommendations that arose from the conference was made available on APhA‚Äôs website.](https://www.pharmacist.com/enhancing-well-being-and-resilience-among-pharmacist-workforce-national-consensus-conference)

The stakeholders at the conference included pharmacists, employers, pharmacy schools, and professional organizations. Together they crafted 50 recommendations across the following domains:

* Pharmacist work conditions and patient safety (11 recommendations)
* Payment models (2 recommendations)
* Relations between pharmacists and employers (7 recommendations)
* Pharmacist and student pharmacist well-being (12 recommendations)
* Well-being education and training (7 recommendations)
* Communications (4 recommendations)
* Data, information, and research on pharmacist well-being (4 recommendations)
* Pharmacist professional development (3 recommendations)

Only one recommendation uses the word **must**, and it is the first one:

&gt; * Employers must prioritize patient safety, quality of care, and pharmacist well-being when setting workload expectations and ensure the pharmacy workforce is adequately staffed, trained, and utilized to complete the expected work volume.

The fact that this, the strongest recommendation, is explicitly addressed towards employers, and at least alludes to the primary issues of understaffing and unrealistic metrics (i.e. expected work volume) is remarkable. It seems like APhA et al. are listening to the pharmacists they say they represent.

I also appreciate the organization and order of the recommendations. Whether intentional or not, the way in which the sections and specific recommendations are ordered has meaning. I personally appreciate the chosen order, focusing on working conditions, patient safety, payment, and pharmacist-employer relations up front. Within each domain, I also find examples where the order indicates placement of priority on real issues pharmacists face (i.e. APhA et al. are listening). For example, under payment models, the first recommendation focused on PBM transparency and ‚Äúerosion in reimbursement.‚Äù Getting paid for cognitive/professional services (i.e. provider status) is relegated to the second (i.e. last) recommendation for the ‚Äúpayment models‚Äù domain.

Reading through the 50 recommendations, I was pleasantly surprised. Nearly half (23/50 by my count) of the recommendations were directed towards employers and pharmacy managers, 16/50 were directed towards professional associations (specifically ACPE [2 recommendations], AACP [1 recommendation], ASHP [1 recommendation], and NABP [1 recommendation]), 7/50 were directed towards pharmacy schools and faculty, and 3/50 towards state boards of pharmacy. Only 3 recommendations were expressly directed at pharmacists (Note: recommendations could be directed at more than one entity and thus the numbers add up to &gt; 50). I think this seems like a fair balance of recommendations, and reflects the relative power that employers have in ensuring patient safety, pharmacist well-being, and improving workplace conditions, while also acknowledging that we as pharmacists also have a role to play in these challenges as well.

The recommendations for employers are too numerous to list here, but in general are focused on prioritizing patient safety and pharmacist well-being, better staffing, realistic metrics, reducing administrative (i.e. non-clinical) tasks, meal breaks, and promoting pharmacist autonomy. For pharmacists specifically, the report recommends that we do the following:

&gt; * Pharmacists should establish and communicate mutually agreeable boundaries with managers, supervisors, patients, and other health professionals without fear of retribution.
&gt; * Pharmacists should actively engage in productive dialogue with employers‚Äîwithout fear of retribution‚Äîto improve awareness of issues that negatively affect well-being and resilience and identify and implement solutions.
&gt; * Pharmacists should assume their professional responsibility to proactively identify personal stressors, learn self-care techniques, and consistently apply strategies that address well-being and help prevent burnout.

What I find particularly notable is that even though these recommendations are directed towards pharmacists, the first 2 are, in my opinion, actually directed towards employers (note the ‚Äúwithout fear of retribution‚Äù requirement).

In summary, I think this report is a step in the right direction. While recommendations are non-binding, I see this report as evidence that APhA and other professional organizations are listening to pharmacists and recognizing the issues faced by those on the frontlines. They are making recommendations targeted towards real issues faced by pharmacists, not just looking towards provider status and MTM to save us. There are also omissions, such as any comment on the large number of schools and graduates, store closures, etc. Nevertheless, I think this is a promising first step from APhA. Between this report and Brad Tice‚Äôs efforts to openly engage in dialogue with pharmacists on social media, I may even be converting from an APhA critic to neutral party. If these positive trends continue, I may even become a supporter.

I would encourage all of you to read the report and engage in productive discussion here on this thread, with your colleagues, and elsewhere.

Not only are preparations like Acanya and Ziana FDA-approved, but the American Academy of Dermatology actively recommends a combination of *all three* (retinoid, benzoyl peroxide, and antibiotic) as a first-line treatment option for mild or moderate acne: https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(15)02614-6/pdf

It boggles my mind that they have PhDs with no clinical experience teaching this stuff instead of pharmacists.

Bonus: this professor also said that cefpodoxime covers Pseudomonas.  Pretty sure you mean ceftazidime there buddy.

pharmacy,Pt faking back injury to get oxy faster,"Lol so I had a patient come in last night about 2 hours to close with an oxy script, there was only me and my pharmacist on duty when he shows up. 

I was currently helping drive through and hear this moaning behind me, I turned around acknowledged him and told him I‚Äôd be with him as soon as I could. The moaning got louder. When I went to help him he starts going off on this huge tangent about how he fucked up his back doing something at work and how this was the worst pain he‚Äôs ever been in in his entire life. I by pass the whole thing and hit him with a ‚ÄúI will have this ready in 1 hour and 30 minutes.‚Äù He then tells me he‚Äôs not going anywhere until his script is ready, he‚Äôs in so much pain, lives 5 blocks away, can‚Äôt move, yadda yadda yadda all while making the most forced moans he could in between sentences so I say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôre welcome to have a seat and wait here for the next hour and half and I call you up when it‚Äôs ready.‚Äù He loses it. Tells me someone else is going to pick it up for him and starts heading for the door. IT TOOK HIM 20 MINUTES TO FAKE  WADDLE THROUGH THE STORE ALL WHILE  MOANING/WAILING  AS LOUD AS HE COULD. 

5 minutes to close, guess who comes strolling in perfectly fine, breathing perfect, standing nice and tall to pick up his script? Like did he really think there was gonna be a shift change?

pharmacy,Today I cried in front of everyone.,"I'm the new pharmacist at work, not even a month now and this happened today. Not because of angry patients, or the workload not being finished at that moment, or drama I had with coworkers..

An innocent phonecall from an old lady, who wished to speak to a pharmacist, turned into a nightmare. I am really a noob, learning still, and was so unprepared. Some of you may think ""big deal, this is nothing"", but here goes anyways:

Patient is worried for her husband and is asking me if atorvastatin could cause a depression for her husband. I doubted it and checked the history and see zopiclon there. I ask if he sleeps badly, she says yes. Patient adds her husband hides the pills from her and also thinks he took ""too many"". She fails to tell how many, but instead adds that he asked her that same morning to help him ""end his misery and suffocate him with a pillow"". She tells me she's scared of him, was beaten and hospitalised by him, and is apparently telling ME all of this for the first time. At this point all sorts of red flags and alarms and emotions rush through me, but I can stay calm surprisingly. I can honestly only think ""OMG did he OD? IS SHE SAFE??"" I'm asking her to check on him if he's breathing, if he's alive. She tells me he's actually awake a little now, asked for food even. I urge the patient to contact her doctor and tell everything she told me, she promises she will. Directly after the call I contact her GP myself as well. GP tells me ""ah not the same old story with those two, I'll handle this, you don't have to deal with it"" and shrugs it off... 

AS IF IT WERE NOTHING. Okay so he knows them better than I do.. and maybe she overdramatizes things..

And then I broke. I cried. In front of the entire tech team and later a bunch more in front of the senior pharmacist. They comforted me, I am happy with how it got resolved and believe I did the right thing and couldn't do/know more than I did. I know I'm human, and having emotions is better than just an emotionless robotic approach.

But oh man, why does this still bother me? I guess I'm asking if anyone else had something similar happening to them?",7,26,2019-08-13,PHARMA,0.12764589488506317,0.8474970459938049,0.024857008829712868

When I arrived the manager couldn‚Äôt find the floater key, and it was concluded that the pharmacist from yesterday either took the key home or left it inside the locked pharmacy. It took about 2 hours for the (rightfully) disgruntled pharmacy manager to come in and unlock things.

While the pharmacy staff and I were locked out, we got to listen to the song of our people the entire time. Three pharmacy calls....Four pharmacy calls... We were all curious how high this would go. Before long it hit ten pharmacy calls, and then silence. Then it started back over at one.

medicine,Is there any reason why a doctor's office could/should/would refuse to provide a patient's medical diagnosis to a pharmacy?,"Story: I had a prescription sent in to my pharmacy today for a 10 year old patient for naltrexone tabs. Naltrexone! Having never seen this prescribed to a peds patient before, I called this doctor's office to 1) confirm the medication was correct and 2) ask for a diagnosis code and medical reason for this patient to document it in our medical record. The medical assistant who called back confirmed they did want this medication but said the doctor was refusing to disclose the medical reason/need for naltrexone, to ""just go ahead and it would be safe to fill it"", and to simply call the mom (who has no medical background) for questions about the medication. Why would that be? For context, this is a ""performance, sports medicine, and metabolism"" clinic, and NOT a pediatrician's office.

What would be the reason, if any, you would want to withhold medical information about a patient to the pharmacy that is dispensing their medication?

To put it in the perspective of the pharmacist, having ICD-10 codes provide some insight to pharmacies and context as to why certain medications are being used in different populations, like when Flomax is used in women for kidney stones, or cis-men getting estrogen patches to help with chemo side effects.  In addition, my state board of pharmacy actually requires medical diagnoses and ICD-10 codes to be noted in a patient's record when filling scripts. You can actually get ""ding'd"" in a board inspection for failing to do so (i.e., giving insulin to a patient but not having diabetes listed on the file, inhalers to a patient but no asthma/COPD diagnosis, etc). I am sure that many pharmacists will tell you they do not like filling scripts blindly or without cause, and since many retail/community pharmacies do not have access to provider chart notes, a simple medical diagnosis is a quick way to check if a medication may or may not be appropriate for the patient. 

I am posting this to the medicine subreddit to see if any providers might have any input for me. I will say that 99% of the providers I have worked with have had no problem discussing medical treatment of a patient with the pharmacy.",78,109,2019-08-14,PHARMA,0.077627032995224,0.900617778301239,0.021755171939730644
pharmacy,Tech giving medical advice,"I‚Äôm a pharmacist at a small hospital and work with 1 tech. She is very controlling and argumentative. The other day I came back to my office from a meeting and heard the last bit of her and a secretary‚Äôs conversation. The secretary is pregnant with severe heartburn and her OB told her to try Pepcid (she had already tried a couple other options). She stopped by the pharmacy to ask if we could order it. My tech (she always has to stick her nose down people‚Äôs throats) told her to try apple cider vinegar tablets. She talked the secretary into ordering these too. She never once said maybe we should check with the pharmacist... Anyway I looked into the tablets further and found that ACV is okay if it is pasteurized. I told my tech that she can‚Äôt take those if they‚Äôre not pasteurized. She had an attitude with me when she said she‚Äôd call the manufacturer. She talked to me like I was a child when I said ‚Äúplease make sure they know you‚Äôre asking about the tablets‚Äù (she didn‚Äôt specify tablets vs liquid when she called them). She was extremely rude and said people get the liquid from the grocery store (like I was stupid for asking her to specify). I obviously was not comfortable with this and I immediately went to the secretary and told her she needs to ask her doctor before trying the ACV tablets. Anyhow...

The manufacturer called back and said the tablets were made from unpasteurized ACV. My tech continually played it off. She went on a big spiel to me, saying that pregnant women do things they‚Äôre not supposed to do all the time, such as eating lunch meat. ‚ÄúThey say you‚Äôre never supposed to eat lunch meat when you‚Äôre pregnant but I know of several pregnant women who ate lunch meat throughout their pregnancy, and they‚Äôre all fine.‚Äù .... and she shrugged it off again saying ‚Äúit really doesn‚Äôt mean she can‚Äôt take it. It‚Äôs really up to the doctor.‚Äù (This tech is the most defensive human being in existence).

Techs have no business giving medical advice, especially to pregnant patients. She would have ordered that without me knowing had I not walked in at that moment. What would you do?",66,108,2019-08-14,PHARMA,0.05942447483539581,0.9139763116836548,0.026599202305078506

medicine,Why is everyone so mad in the hospital?,"Warning long rant ahead:

1. Cross specialty. I've noticed that there is air of hostility among providers in our field. Naturally, this is most evident during consultations. As a personal anecdote, ED providers and ""list-heavy"" teams (think transplant surgery) are the most hostile in my opinion. As a senior level resident, I've persistently seen my juniors and interns field calls from individuals are short tempered, rude, and/or annoyed. Often times, the consulting team doesn't know what their specific question is. Furthermore, when discussing patients it almost seems as if clarifying questions are interpreted as hostile and seen as personal attacks. 

2. Nursing staff. I work at three different major hospitals and all have their own quirks. In particular at children's hospitals - it seems that nurses here take great pride and ownership over their kiddos (which isn't a bad thing by itself) and for the most part, it seems like they are really do understand the ""overall"" plan. However, with that said, I have met many which do not consider the physician as a major player in the patient's care and become almost ""possessive"" over their patient. Phrases such as ""don't touch MY patient"" or ""excuse me, who are you?"" are often spoken in a deeming, rather than an inquisitive tone. It's frustrating to hear things such as this and honestly a little disrespectful, especially when you've just spent 8 hours doing a complete laryngotracheal reconstruction.

3. Patients. Honestly, not sure what to say about this one. Maybe I've had a bad stretch, but the number of patients who simply do not trust physicians or have convinced themselves that their doctors have ulterior motives is very baffling to me. Furthermore, the number of demeaning comments towards residents directed towards the  sex, race, or age (e.g. ""you're too young to be a doctor"") seems to be increasing.

pharmacy,Online pharmacy reviews,"I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night, so I thought I‚Äôd google  reviews of my pharmacy. My particular pharmacy wasn‚Äôt very exciting, so I googled the company and came across some doozies. Does anyone else do this? If so, don‚Äôt you wish you could respond to them?

Some of my favorites (not direct quotes, just the basics) &amp; what I‚Äôd like to respond:

1) drive thru is supposed to be quicker, but I always have to wait
*Drive thru is for convenience, not speed*

2) they couldn‚Äôt get the medicine my doctor ordered, that I‚Äôve been taking for years, so they called the doctor to switch it. The new medicine was more expensive. They‚Äôre just out for our hard earned money
*Please educate yourself on backordered medicines. We didn‚Äôt CHOOSE to switch it, or the replacement, the DOCTOR chose the replacement. Not our fault it was more expensive*

3) I tried calling and they didn‚Äôt answer so I went in. Both lines were long, the phone was ringing CONSTANTLY, and nobody was answering it. What‚Äôs so hard about answering the phone?
*ummmm....if there are ‚Äúlong lines‚Äù in the store, who‚Äôs supposed to answer the phones? The pharmacy elves?*

4) My doctor called a prescription in early one morning. I got there when they opened at 9 &amp; I was told it would be another hour or so to get it. My doctor had called it in at 7, it should have been ready!

medicine,IV versus PO antibiotics,"Recently, I've had a handful of physicians insisting on IV antibiotics for patients who are not NPO, for drugs with good absorption.   For example, levofloxacin.  

I'm wondering if there is some conventional wisdom in MD circles that pushes for IV abx?  I've been searching for any studies that compare outcomes of IV vs PO and show a benefit of IV and I haven't found anything.  

IV introduces more issues: potential for administration errors (extravasation, compatibility. Etc.) ,more fluid for the patient, occupation of the line if you have other IV meds going in, etc.  What's with the insistence on IV?

medicine,Suspected munchausen by proxy in mother of my patient,"I'll try to be as descriptive as I can without going too deep, but this is a bit lengthy.

I have a patient that I am often assigned to. This patient has an order for 1:1 safety advocate(sitter) 24/7 due to behavioral issues/mental retardation (IQ&lt;70). Current hospital stay began when mom brought in patient to ED for behavioral disturbances/aggression. Come to find out patient had been in an adult group home successfully managing patient's psychiatric issues and behavioral disturbances, when mom suddenly and without explanation removed patient from home and suddenly stopped all psych meds. Since then patient has been in and out of hospitals for primarily behavioral issues but also, per mom, various medical problems (everything from brain tumors to pancreatic cancer, all unfounded). Each time nothing is found to be wrong other than meds need to be adhered to.

As of now, mom is POA, but APS is working on a case to have that removed as MSBP is suspected due to exaggerated patient symptoms, falsifying diagnoses hx, and requesting completely unnecessary and stressful tests and operations (such as a brain biopsy). Since nothing has been done legally yet mom still gets visits, but per psychiatry visits are limited and 100% supervised. Mom can be asked (usually forced) to leave when her behavior starts aggravating patient. On several occasions mom has amped up her child's behavior to the point that the patient violently assaults staff. Several have been sent to the ED for this.

With altered medication regimen, patient's psych status has greatly improved. Behavioral outbursts are now limited to specific and very understandable triggers. However every time mom comes for a visit patient gets aggravated and mental stability declines. Always ends in either crying or assaulting staff. Usually just the former if Mom leaves before things get out of hand. Patient has voiced feeling neglected and abused by mom, has stated fear over mom's presence and control over patient's medical wishes. Despite all this mom still gets to visit.

My question is, as a sitter and the supervisory staff for her visits, at what point can I make her leave? I can tell when patient is getting worked up, but currently mom is only asked to leave when patient has gotten completely out of control and security is called to help with patient behavior. I have heard during several conversations between the two mom telling her child that she's dying, there's something seriously wrong, her meds are killing her, etc, and when Mom leaves we're stuck doing damage control. Patient clearly loves mom, fears her to a degree, but does not have the mental capacity to understand what's going on. Patient sometimes feels that we are holding patient prisoner and accusing mom of abusing patient (mom tells child that mom's being denied rights, we're stopping her from ever seeing patient again because we're evil, all to purposely get patient worked up), but patient will then acknowledge the decayed mental state of mom and how mom being around isn't good for her.

As I'm at the bottom of the totem pole I don't know where my abilities lie in controlling the situation. I personally feel like mom should have no visitation rights, but I'm in no position to be making that decision. In the least it's obvious the harm her visits are doing and it's so painful to watch the patient psychologically suffer like this. I just don't know what to do in the meantime while things are being sorted out legally.",22,38,2019-08-18,PHARMA,0.19756339490413666,0.7791353464126587,0.02330128103494644

I went to talk to some directors of various groups here about their groups and what they do etc. A couple have asked me if I intend to work here after I am done with my MS, and told me to keep in touch. 

Professionally, what does keep in touch mean?  How would I go about keeping in touch after I leave, and not in a way that is begging for a job, or playing up a false friendship that want there?  Or even just being a nuisance. I would like to potentially keep in touch not just with the directors but with my group even.

medicine,Struggling working with midlevels during fellowship,"Just started fellowship. I am having a hard time working with the midlevels.

I entered into it with the notion that these were going to be my peers. But what I'm finding more and more is that they completely look down on me. I feel like they think I'm an idiot. And now I'm starting to feel like an idiot.

You know how when a person is trying to speak a new language to a native speaker, the native speaker has a bias that the person is unintelligent because their grammar and pronunciation are incorrect? That's what's going on here. I am a newcomer, I don't know the EMR, I don't know the hospital, and I don't know the culture. But these midlevels have been here for years. And they will be staying for years more, while I'll be out relatively soon.

Oh and I obviously don't know the subspecialty. Duh. That's why I'm training in a fellowship. But they do. They know it more than me.

I would chalk this up to ego on my part. I'm willing to. But the other day I asked one of them for an opinion -like I would a peer- on a recommendation I should make. And you know what happened? I got pimped. Like a goddamn intern.

It's like my residency doesn't count for anything. Anytime I try to share an experience from residency that informs my practice, it is ignored by them, presumably because they don't care. Or maybe they think I'm trying to flex by talking about training they don't have. Do you know how simultaneously depressing and enraging that is? All that work? Those years? That sacrifice? To just shrug it off like it never happened? And to treat me like I know absolutely nothing?

I'm more depressed by this than I ever was in residency. We were collegial back then. No one cared if you didn't know something. They didn't Socratic method you if you asked a question, they just told you because that's what you do when you regard someone as an equal.

But at the same time I recognize they know more about what they are doing than I do right now. So maybe they are right. Maybe my residency no longer matter because, hey, whoever has been doing this longer is the one that knows the most.

Can someone please help me out with some perspective? I'm not looking to get confrontational with them or go to my PD or anything like that. I just want a defense mechanism, something I can tell myself that makes this okay.. Please. It's only August and I feel defeated every single day I leave the hospital.

medicine,Why are so many patients on benzodiazepines for long-term therapy to treat anxiety?,"I‚Äôve been practicing in family medicine for less than 5 years, one common thing that I‚Äôve struggled with is patients who come into the clinic taking a daily scheduled benzodiazepine to treat anxiety.  From my understanding benzodiazepines are not an appropriate or effective maintenance treatment for anxiety.  




Usually this patient has taken the medication longer than a year and it‚Äôll be a shorter acting medication taken 3-4 times a day.  These patients are generally not taking what I would consider a maintenance medication (SSRI, SNRI, etc.).  The most confusing part is that many of them feel like their current therapy is ineffective yet are not willing to try starting a maintenance medication, CBT, and weaning off of the benzo.





My problem with the situation is that I feel like most of the patients are truly addicted to the medications, treatment is not effective, and I‚Äôm essentially being forced into a role of helping them continue their addiction or a stop along the way until they find someone who will continue their prescription. 




Is there really a role for daily benzodiazepines?  Do you have patients who use this type of medication as their primary treatment for anxiety?  Outside of offering to start a new medication, start CBT, and tapering off of the benzo over several months is there a better way to approach this situation?

medicine,Hello meddit. I'm the radiologist who was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma a few years ago (rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated). It's been a while so I figured I'd give you guys an update.,"After a while of talking about everything on social media, I decided to take a break and live my life in the real world. I focused on working hard during my last year of residency. Over the past year I‚Äôve been working as an attending, which is substantially more rewarding than being a resident (particularly, I think, for radiologists since we have such little autonomy as residents). And my wife and I are expecting our first child in a few months, so I'll get to be a dad, even if it's just for a little while. Honestly, if it weren't for my fungating cancer, my life would be great!

-

For those of you who never saw [my original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/51o49k/32_yearold_previously_healthy_male_presents_with/), I was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma in February of 2016. I had extensive disease (my PCI was 31/39) so we decided to do a two-stage resection from the onset. The first surgery was in March 2016 and we did an extended right hemicolectomy, a cholecystectomy, splenectomy, omentectomy, and overall tumor debulking. We also did HIPEC with cisplatin, which unfortunately resulted in severe AKI. I was on dialysis for 3 months, and my kidney function has only recovered to around CKD 3b levels. There were other moderately serious complications that we addressed as they arose, but none of them were as significant as the kidney injury.

-

Between surgeries, we did intraperitoneal chemo with doxorubicin and carboplatin (alternating every other treatment) for about 8 cycles. The second surgery (November 2016) involved primarily a distal duodenal reconstruction (luckily the biliary tree wasn‚Äôt involved), another hemicolectomy, more debulking, and a second HIPEC. The second recovery went much more smoothly. However, we got a PET/CT a few months later, and there was some hypermetabolic activity associated with some soft tissue masses, so we started IV chemo with carboplatin, Alimta, and Avastin (early 2017). 

-

We did something like 10-12 cycles of that. The abdominal disease was stable during chemo, but two mediastinal nodules near the apex of my heart enlarged, so CT surgery took them out with a robotic assisted thoracotomy (August 2017). We continued on chemo until the side effects became too much to handle (March 2018). Things had been stable so we decided to take a break from full treatment and just do maintenance Avastin. The ""masses"" we were treating might not have been anything, either. They haven‚Äôt really changed to this day and are probably just granulation and/or scar tissue.

-

After the second surgery but while I was on chemo, I went back to work and finished my last year of residency. In July 2018 we moved so I could start my real job and to be close to my family. A group where my parents live was willing to hire me without doing a fellowship, and after everything that had happened, I didn‚Äôt want to spend another year of my life in training. Anyway, I continued Avastin down here every 3 weeks, but around November of 2018 new lesions showed up in my pancreas. It took a while to coordinate the surgery, but in February of 2019, I had a third ex-lap to try to do a distal pancreatectomy. It was unsuccessful due to the degree of adhesions from the other surgeries and HIPECs, and also complicated by two EC fistulas that took 4-5 months to fully heal. I was on TPN for 2-3 months after that, but they‚Äôve finally healed and I‚Äôm eating and drinking normally again.

-

Unfortunately, the pancreatic masses continue to grow, so now it‚Äôs time to start looking into clinical trials. There are a couple up at the NIH that I‚Äôm looking into, and if those fall through there‚Äôs something starting at Ohio State soon that I‚Äôm hopeful I can get into. The one at NIH that I‚Äôm most interested in is a T-cell trial. It would be the first time trying it out on humans, from what I understand, but they‚Äôve had good success with it in mice models of ovarian cancer. It targets mesothelin, which is over-expressed in both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma (among others), so there‚Äôs a good chance it might work. I‚Äôm already running into pushback from them because of my kidney function, but I‚Äôm hopeful we can figure something out and that they‚Äôll let me into their trial.

-

Before you (or I) go feeling a bit too sorry for me (or myself), I want to tell you a little story to put things into perspective. A few weeks ago, the wife of one of the younger partners in my group ‚Äì someone who was only in her early 30s ‚Äì randomly had a heart attack and subsequently passed away a few days later. She had been totally healthy, right up until the point that she wasn‚Äôt. She and her husband have multiple young children. So, getting a cancer diagnosis isn‚Äôt the worst thing you might have to deal with.

-

There‚Äôs basically no circumstance in life that can‚Äôt be made infinitely worse by some other horrible tragedy. Whenever you start feeling too sorry for yourself because you‚Äôre dealing with some shit, just remember that you should be grateful for the blessings you do have. It could be worse. It can ***always*** be worse.

-

Feeling sorry for yourself is the road to despair. The situation in which you find yourself might be out of your control, but the attitude you take while dealing with that situation is entirely up to you. The only thing you can actually control in this plane of existence is yourself. Horrible, terrible things will eventually happen to you in your life, and they‚Äôll cause you misery and anguish, but they can only destroy you if you let them. There‚Äôs a big difference between dying and being destroyed. I‚Äôm choosing not to be destroyed by this, even if it ends up killing me. 

-

There is an indomitable ‚Äì dare I say Holy ‚Äì spirit that resides within all of us, but you have to call it forth. You do so by accepting forthrightly the challenges that life has given you, with as much acquiescence to the facts of the matter as you can manage. I‚Äôm not saying that you‚Äôre magically going to get whatever you want in life. Far from it. But I *am* saying that you have the capability to withstand any challenge this world can throw at you. If you‚Äôve never had to face some sort of awful tragedy in your life, just wait a while. You‚Äôll eventually be facing the same kind of choice that I am, and you too will have a decision to make.

medicine,Ondansetron and SSRI‚Äôs,"TLDR: Ondansetron and SSRI interactions and dangers

Hey all, 

Aussie Paramedic here seeking a decent explanation on the use of Ondansetron in someone who is prescribed SSRI‚Äôs (or any antidepressant that may have an effect on QTc)

 I have base fundamental pharmacology knowledge from uni, but it‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve touched my pharmacology textbook. Whilst I‚Äôm happy with interpreting most drugs individual pharmacodynamics/kinetics, I struggle to put into context how certain drugs interact with each other. 


It‚Äôs been reported to me that administration of Ondansetron in patients taking SSRI‚Äôs places them at an increased risk of prolonging their QTc and subsequently increasing chances of an R on T / torsades episode. In my practice, SSRI‚Äôs aren‚Äôt mentioned in contraindications or precautions for Ondansetron administration, and in my setting we‚Äôd always have them on cardiac monitoring - however, we are increasingly administering ondansetron in low-risk patients and leaving them at home / organising GP appointments for them at a later date. I don‚Äôt want to place anyone in any unnecessary danger if it can be avoided. Searching the drug interaction comes up with the potential life-threatening interaction and states to avoid combination, however I know that a good 60-70% of our patients are on SSRI‚Äôs (namely sertraline) and are given ODT ondans without a second thought. To my knowledge, Ondansetron doesn‚Äôt have a significant impact on QTc unless it is being administered intravenously (which we also do, however we don‚Äôt leave these patients at home). With the prevalence of SSRI usage and the relatively common prescription for ondansetron, I take it that if it was a huge issue it would be more prevalent in training / warnings. 

Essentially I‚Äôm looking for a dumbed down explanation regarding the interaction between the two drugs, and the actual risk of harm with co-administration. Any info would be greatly appreciated! 

Edit: As a side note, if anyone could elaborate on the usage of ondansetron in patients taking SSRI‚Äôs (or other antidepressants) +/- sympathomimetics and the risk of serotonin syndrome that would also be greatly appreciated.",35,92,2019-08-25,PHARMA,0.09904506802558899,0.8780258297920227,0.022929029539227486

medicine,Are white coats still a thing?,"I just saw a conversation on another /r/ discussing different coat lengths and how it seemingly is a great deal in some areas for some people.

I live in Austria and it feels like in the recent years (throughout my studies) coats are getting more and more obsolete, with hospitals finally providing other options (however, there are always too less pockets if you don't wear a coat :-D). Having a doctors coat is though still a privilege which is not easily given up. Some will always wear one, others hated it from the beginning. But at least here where i live (EU, Austria) there is a trend towards fewer coats i think.

Given the fact, that coats are way more unhygienic even negligent some might argue, i kinda asked myself: Are white coats still a thing?

Whats your take on that? Do you see a change towards less coats?

WHERE AM I SENDING THIS TO?

You can print out this form and mail it to me at 1515-B W. Fullerton Ave, Addison, Illinois 60101.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THIS?

Once I receive your signed card I will assign it a number, I will log information (no identifying information just non-identifying information) then take it to my bank which is Chase and store it in the safe deposit box that I already rent.  I will report back to you all via this reddit site how many cards I have received in total, how many from each state, and how many from each company.  Hopefully that will spur more people on to send in their card.  If your company /  hospital is small and there are not a lot of pharmacist employees then I will refrain from listing this information as I do not want to take a chance that there could be any repercussions.  After receiving at least 250 cards I will come back to begin discussions regarding what needs to be in the agreement.  The more cards that come in the more I will ramp up activities.  Send in your card and let's get this ball rolling.

EDIT:

Pharmacists have more power than they give themselves credit for, but I know you are all aware of this power.  If you are in a Right to Work State or a Non Right to Work State you still are in a state that requires a pharmacist licensed in that state to have an open pharmacy.  If you are a factory worker in a Right to Work State and your union facility goes on strike for economic reasons can they just hire a number of people off the street to replace you while you strike?  Yes.  If you are a pharmacist in a Right to Work state and you go on strike or threaten a strike or imply a possible strike can they just hire a number of people off the street to replace you while you strike? No.  Do they have enough licensed pharmacists for that state in upper management, as floaters, available in the area as unemployed or underemployed to replace you?  Depends on the number they would have to deal with.  The more people they have to deal with the less capable they would be in overcoming the situation.  Many companies recently have replaced their pharmacist DMs or RMs with non pharmacy personnel.  So, could chain pharmacy operations be slowed or even totally shut down if a percentage of pharmacists in a state threaten to strike? Probably not in one state unless it was a high population state such as Texas, California, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania.  But if it was in two states, then I would say yes, and if it was in three states, most definitely.  More than three states and I think you could throw a massive monkey wrench in the works....get more than one chain's pharmacists to participate and we would be unstoppable.  How long would something like this have to go on before a huge economic pain would be felt by the chains?  I believe not very long.  Imagine a state like California with its chain pharmacy operations cut by 30%.  Imagine now that both California and New York participated.  The chains would be overwhelmed very quickly.  Now add Pennsylvania and few smaller states and they would be totally at the mercy of the workers.  Please start spreading the word.

medicine,"MDs: as a behavioral health provider, how can I help the families of my ID/DD clients prepare for appointments?","I‚Äôm a behavioral health provider and often see clients who are minimally communicative (usually together with ID/DD), and also clients with normal or above-average IQ but clinically significant deficits in self-awareness to the point of being unable to describe symptoms well. 


In those normal IQ patients there are also theory of mind issues, so we run into things like the client never mentioning severe heartburn because they just didn‚Äôt ever stop to think that it‚Äôs not normal, answering ‚Äúno‚Äù if asked whether it hurts to eat (because to them, ‚Äúhurt‚Äù is an elevation over baseline, except their baseline is what we call ‚Äúhurts‚Äù), giving incomplete (complete to them) answers to questions, BUT being able to give useful info if they are asked a perfectly worded question.  


To further complicate things, some clients also don‚Äôt understand very simple commands or they have severe behavioral issues that make things like blood draws or even blood pressure tests quite difficult. 


 I get a significant amount of time with the parents/caregivers both in-home and in clinic, and insurance generally allows (after some phone calls and letters) me to attend medical appointments with the clients if necessary. This is what I‚Äôve been doing so far based on feedback from MDs:

* use therapy to address behavioral issues, prep for procedures (rehearse steps, desensitization when appropriate), determine accommodations (dimmed lights, appt after lunch), prioritize health communication (‚Äúpoint to where it hurts‚Äù) 
* make sure parents log basic health info BEFORE the dr visit (ideally 2 weeks of food/liquid intake, bx symptoms, sleep, general activity/engagement levels, BM/urine output)


Even with all that, the majority of medical appointments result in doctors saying they can‚Äôt assess and don‚Äôt know who to refer out to. This is a huge issue because it leads to situations like chronic constipation going untreated until it‚Äôs a full impaction needing inpatient care. Sometimes the necessary test can be identified (swallow study) but the MD says it‚Äôs impossible because the kid wouldn‚Äôt tolerate it... so instead they end up having to tolerate a feeding tube a few years later. 


There are some hospitals that have dedicated clinics for this population, but waitlists are long, they often require symptoms to have escalated to a certain point before even putting a family on the waitlist, many families don‚Äôt have the ability to take two weeks off of work to go to another state while their kid gets testing, and sometimes there‚Äôs no real option for followup care.  


What else can I do on my end to help these clients be able to get adequate medical care? Are there any behavioral skills that are especially helpful to make exams easier? Information to log that would give you a better idea of what‚Äôs going on?",39,138,2019-08-28,PHARMA,0.06441282480955124,0.9086792469024658,0.026907898485660553

medicine,"Hypothesis on the ""mid-level creep"" and an argument as to why APPs should not be held responsible for it","As I move through training and become exposed to more and more APPs, I do so within the context of the changing landscape of medicine. I did residency in a place where there weren't a lot, and I am now doing fellowship in a place where there are more. In doing this I've been forming comparisons between how it used to be and how it is, but instead of focusing on how things are different I have focused on how they are the same. So I wanted to see if we could get a discussion going in the room about this.

What's the same -and what is the main problem in medicine IMO- is that we see too many patients. Hospitals are too full. Censuses (censes?) are too high. Teams are stretched thin. In Raiders of the Lost Ark there's a quote, ""It's not the years, it's the mileage."" To adapt that for our situation: it's not the hours, it's the workload. 

What I'm seeing is APPs shouldering huge amounts of this workload. Sometimes there are triage systems in place for the types of cases they will get, but more often it is just whoever is open to take a case. You can't give someone such a high workload without expecting them to be able to make some independent decisions, so naturally that becomes part of the job. 

So my hypothesis is a mind-numbingly simple one and I'm embarrassed it took me so long to think of it: **if you treat someone like an independent clinician, they are going to want to be treated like an independent clinician.**

You want someone to run a case behind the curtain in the OR for 99% of the surgery? Yeah they're going to feel and want to be seen as anesthesiologists. You want someone to open, close, and assist through the entirety of the case, *and then* round on the patient for periop care? Yeah they're going to feel and want to be seen as junior surgeons. You want someone to see 5 consults a day? Yeah they're going to feel and wanted to be seen as consultants. 

Medical societies here and there keep explicitly writing this message, to paraphrase, that physicians are the most capable at independent practice and for patient safety. Yet the *implicit* message is completely the opposite of that. So this is not PAs and NPs wanting to be something they aren't. It's them wanting to be something they are already mostly being! Imagine having the title ""physician assistant"" only to find you are doing 90% of what a physician does. Do you feel like an assistant? How can we blame them for no longer liking that title?

I'm sorry for the long missive, but its borne out of utter resentment for the administrators trying to squeeze so much work out of all of us. And in doing so, we have these strange little issues pop up that end up breeding dissent in this unique workplace.

""Admins"" is a nebulous boogeyman term. I don't know that it's their fault. But I'll tell you one thing, somebody is happy about all this. They are happy about getting someone to do 90% of the work for 50% (or less) of the cost. But instead of using that model to make work easier on us, they use it to get us to work *more* and generate more profit. We as docs aren't happy about that. The APPs aren't happy. Patients certainly aren't happy.

medicine,Attending feeling down first week of job,"Hello Meddit.

As title states. I'm a hospitalist, newly grad from residency, and just out in the work force. My first week on as a hospitalist didn't turn out too well. Had a CODE blue cardiac arrest on me. 
Cannot say that I predicted it but had a feeling the patient was the sickest on my census. It's easier to look back and think of what I should have done earlier, but in the moment it appears as if nothing like this was coming. 

I have dealt with death before and cases going the wrong way. However this one in particular hits me hard especially as an Attending and first time on the job. 
Starting to make me doubt why I choose the field I am in. Make me think to switch career. Not a great feeling. No SI/HI so don't worry but def confidence in myself in the toilet. I know I'm a good physician, I know I'm not the best out there but I work really hard to get where I am. 

Any suggestions on how to cope will help.



EDIT: wow, I appreciate all the response and the meddit community reaching out to me. it is indeed a tough one to swallow. but I appreciate all the love and knowing that I am not alone in this. Thank you",62,389,2019-08-30,PHARMA,0.03906181454658508,0.8959184288978577,0.06501972675323486

pharmacy,Let's talk about methadone,"It's been awhile since I have managed a methadone conversion patient, so I wanted to get some input as well as tips and tricks from those in pain management.

Here's the situation: Female, 30's, palliative care cancer patient. She is stage 4 and currently getting palliative radiation. She is using the following and pain is NOT well controlled:

* Fentanyl 250 ug/hr patch q72h
* Oxycontin 80 mg tab 3x daily
* Oxycodone 40 mg tab q4h

[GlobalRPh](https://globalrph.com/medcalcs/opioid-pain-management-converter-advanced/) calculator tells me the equivalent methadone dose is 61 mg/day, which I would divide into 20 mg TID or 30 mg BID.

**Here's my question**: when converting from fentanyl to methadone, what is best practice to switch? I don't want this poor lady to have a period of less than adequate pain control. Scenarios I have considered:

1. (Day 1) Remove fentanyl patches + stop Oxycontin, start methadone, continue oxycodone IR for breakthrough?
2. OR (Day 1) remove fentanyl patches, start methadone, (Day 2) Stop Oxycontin after 24 hours of overlap, continue oxycodone IR?
3. OR (Day 1) Stop Oxycontin, start methadone, (Day 3) remove fentanyl patches after 3 days overlap, continue oxycodone IR?

Just having a little bit of trouble thinking through all this. Advice appreciated!",39,60,2019-08-30,PHARMA,0.10698796063661575,0.8688262701034546,0.02418581210076809

medicine,Emergency docs: How do you deal with the OD/alcohol excess patients in ED who stone wall you?,"Rotated into my ED job 3 weeks ago (in the UK you spend your 1st 2 years out of med school as a foundation doctor rotating through jobs every 4 months before entering a specific specialty training programme once you've had a taste of various specialities.) I absolutely love it, enjoying it more than any job i've worked so far despite the shift patterns being dreadful.

The sheer number of OD/alcohol excess cases is mind blowing. A large majority accept the help offered and will talk to mental health/alcohol liaison services after sobering up in our short stay unit. However, there are a select few who completely stone wall you. Refuse any bloods, refuse to give you a history, refuse everything basically. They just sit there on the trolley and usually (if they have capacity) self discharge after a while.  I find myself getting frustrated as I find myself both wanting to help them and telling them to get out of the department! Very quickly learning how important a good poker face it. Internally I am screaming and I really have to bite my tongue to stop myself saying anything unprofessional.

My question is; how do you keep up a professional demeanour with these patients whilst encouraging them to accept help and/or leave? I know it's early days for me but any tips would be great.",118,238,2019-08-31,PHARMA,0.03737559914588928,0.9174555540084839,0.04516886547207832
