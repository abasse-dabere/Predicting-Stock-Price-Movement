I'm a pediatric heme-onc fellow, and I'm on call for the Fourth of July Weekend. Last night, one of the residents called me to say that one of our patients was unresponsive and hyponatremic. They had called the PICU fellow, who wanted to take the patient upstairs to give hypertonic saline. It's our practice to go into the hospital when a patient goes to the PICU, so I headed in. 

When I arrived, the patient was actually NOT in the PICU yet. I was somewhat alarmed, but went into the room to check on them. I saw a wide awake, playing baby. I looked at mom, totally confused. 

""They woke her up from a nap, and sometimes it takes a while for her to wake up,"" mom said. ""She's fine now, don't you think?""

I totally agreed with her, and walked out of the room. Then, I realized what day it was. July First. New interns. New Seniors. I had just been called in for a sleeping baby.

I know most of us spent some time volunteering in the hospital and maybe some research. But what other jobs/positions have you held? 

While in undergrad in Austin, Texas, I delivered chicken wings and worked at a sandwich shop for years. This was a time before most people had cell phones and certainly before Google maps to plan our trip and before gps was widely available to consumers, so we'd have to look at a map on the wall before our delivery and try to remember where we were going which sucked ( http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/texas/travis_txdot_5255.jpg ) but at least no one was dying or bleeding out in front of me.

General tips:
- Jobs list and prioritise. Sick people first.

- Escalate appropriately, have notes, drugs and observe in front of you when ringing someone up. Make sure you've done the prelimary work up and have examined the patient. 

- Make friends with the nurses. They will make you tea.

- Don't go too mad for coffee, there may be a point where rest is possible.

- Document a clear plan to avoid getting bleeped multiple times about the same thing

Im currently on my APPE rotations and doing my first block at an acute care hospital. We had our mid-point evaluation today and while I got good feedback from my preceptor, he does want me to be more proactive in medication therapy and med recs. I'm just unsure what I should be looking out for. I often look at antibiotic dosing to see if it's correct but for the most part, I don't come across any drug-related issue that I could intervene on. I'm afraid Im just not looking hard enough but it's a little overwhelming as it's my first APPE and I'm just getting used to everything. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what I should be looking out for when I look through patient medications. Any tips or guidance would be super appreciated! Thank you!

medicine,[meta] /r/medicine mods are looking for subreddit feedback.,"/r/medicine mods are looking for any feedback or recommendations to help keep this subreddit a high quality community. Specifically, we’re looking for community input on the subreddit rules and enforcement, as well as for suggestions for improvement about the content or moderation of the subreddit. We’d like to know what you like most and least about /r/medicine, what you’d like to see changed, and how you think we ought to do that.

A couple things that have come up since the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/406efm/meta_rmedicine_mods_would_like_your_opinions_on/) are:

1. We've reworded a few of the rules to cover a few scenarios that were coming up frequently - specifically, we've added a sentence disallowing surveys (which we previously just removed on an ad hoc basis) and a sentence explicitly disallowing homework help.
1. We've had a comment from a community member requesting that we consider requiring all direct PDF links to be submitted in self-posts, or with a [PDF] advisory label. This primarily affects people browsing the subreddit on mobile as a warning before clicking on a PDF on a phone might be appreciated. I wouldn't particularly affected by this rule either way so I'm wondering what you guys think.
1. In my (purely anecdotal) experience, we've been getting a greater number of laypeople involved on the sub - most frequently when we're linked by other subreddits but also in standard posts. This sub has always been targeted specifically for medical professionals but we do allow and even encourage layperson participation. However we're still enforcing rule #3 and have reworded that slightly into 'this is not AskMeddit' to cover a broader range of layperson involvement that would not be of general interest to the community of medical professionals.
1. We've been having to enforce rule #5 (no personal attacks/abusive language) more frequently - primarily on driveby accounts. Our typical escalation policy for most offenses is to remove and ban for major/repeated offenses, and to warn ± remove for regular community members or for minor offenses, but it's largely up to mod judgment. We appreciate it when people report comments, even those that might be borderline cases - if we think it should stand, we'll simply ignore it.
1. We're still working on a method of getting clinical cases to happen more regularly - they generate a lot of interest when they happen but the time required to put one together is immense.

I'm happy to hear your thoughts on the above points or any that you'd like to bring up - this post will remain stickied for at least a week and we'll try to reply to as much as we can. It would be particularly helpful if any suggestions, if possible, were accompanied by a link to a submission or a comment that illustrates the issue.

Please bear in mind that this is a community of over 71,000 people and this subreddit is moderated by a few volunteers with day (and night) jobs. Proposed changes should be both philosophically and practically acceptable and should take into consideration this subreddit’s target audience of medical professionals.

Thanks,

medicine,Doctors who surprise you (xpost from /r/nursing),"There's this attending surgeon who really surprised me this weekend:

I'm a nurse on med surg unit. Just hit the floor on Friday, starting my morning med pass/assessments when I get a page saying, ""From Dr. X: Foley is out for patient John Doe, 500cc emptied."" Strange, didn't realize this patient's foley was supposed to be removed. Turns out Dr. X, the attending, decided he wanted the foley out early, and rather than notifying the front desk to notify me, he went to the supply room, grabbed a syringe, and dc'd the foley himself, and knew to let us know the output emptied so we could record it.

The patient and his roommate were absolutely floored, blown away that the top doctor had no qualms with performing a task usually delegated to RNs and CNAs, they couldn't stop talking about it through the morning. I was also shocked and so impressed by Dr. X's willingness to ""humble"" himself to just pull the foley himself.

Then yesterday, same patient, Dr. X is rounding with his Jr's. Patient Doe hasn't passed gas, no bowel sounds, having lots of gas (burping), not tolerating POs, so we're concerned about post op ileus. Dr. X tells the patient that the primary goal for today is to get up and do a lot of walking to help return bowel function. This is very early in the morning so patient Doe is still in bed. Dr. X says, ""Alright let's go, we're getting you up,"" and proceeds to help get the patient up in his recliner, sets up his IV pole, positions his bedside table, and grabs him some ice chips and swabs for comfort.

When I finally get in to see the patient, he again can't stop beaming about how Dr. X helped get him up, and again I'm left in utter shock. Patient ended up walking like 3 times before noon. To his credit, Dr. X is known on the floor as one of the more down to earth attending surgeons, he's got a track record of doing these things. Still, can't help but be pleasantly surprised whenever physicians, especially the top doc's, demonstrate such humility.

No matter your area of practice/specialty, just wanted to let you all know that patients appreciate these seemingly small acts of compassion (getting the patient a cup of water, grabbing them an extra blanket and tucking them in, helping them put on their socks, tidying up their room a bit before you leave, etc etc etc). I know you guys are often overwhelmed and are often rushed during rounds, but these smalls gestures stick with patients, as well as floor staff. Especially when it's coming from the doctor.

How is it diagnosed?  Am I correct in thinking that it is diagnosed based on presenting symptoms after a seizure?

medicine,"So the FP office where I work says ambulance doesn't like it if patient needs to be urgently sent to hospital with ambulance and isn't ""lying down"" as if rly ill. What happened today about a possible internal brain hemorrhage patient, and some questions.","I work as a family physician sub in Europe and am relatively new to the field. Graduated recently from med school and have only 2 months of work experience here. 

Regardless, had a patient today (45 y male) who's a bit new to this town, who has had a history of asthma, bipolar illness and stroke in basal ganglia with some hemorrhage in 2009. Not sure why (drug abuse?). Family doesn't have cardiovascular risk factors according to him. I learned this later but he was since then admitted 4 times with questions of new CVE. They concluded with small vascular disease and was put on anticoagulants. He's on dipyridamole now. 

So the patient is a smoker and history of several illegal drug abuse but is free from it for 2 yrs with cocaine, amfetanine, etc. He had intense headache that came abruptly at 1-2 am on the left side of the head as he was resting. He feels as if someone hit him on the head with a bat. The pain is constant reaching some highs, like an attack, from few secs to few mins. He has no other symptoms. Possible feeling of dizziness. He took paracet and NSAID and it didn't help. He hasn't felt this kind of pain before. 

14 hours later I see him. He’s thin, struggling with weight loss this yr, no night sweats. He has normal HR and BP, both sides. No fever, negative CRP. He's in good condition. Left lower abdominal pain on palpation and when releasing my hands. 
Normal extremity reflexes, neg brudzinski sign, however *his right pupil is dilated* compared to the left one but has normal light reflexes direct and indirect. He hasn't noticed this before, so not sure how long he has had it. *Left tempero-parietal junction is tender on palpation*. Says he suffers from decreased sensation on right side of body after the stroke. Babinski is negative on right, and indifferent on left foot (very slight fanning of toes).

I sent him to the hospital which is 1.5 hours away to exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage. He's kind of young for temporal arteritis and not sure it comes on this acutely. The attacks of pain are on a scale of 0-10 about 7-8. 
I wanted to order an ambulance to take him but the staff (nurse/secretary) says ambulance doesn't like it if he isn't lying down when they pick him up. I mean wtf, I don’t get that. Anyways since its been 14 hours I gave him permission to go home (which is close) and put his dog home and taxi would take him from there. 

My question is, was that a fine decision or should he have been sent immediately with ambulance regardless of what the staff says. I mean not all patients are ill enough to be lying down yet need urgent care. My feeling was I felt it was fine if he was few mins delayed, especially with 14 hours history of pain. 
Also inputs on diagnosis? If interested I can post the result when I find out after he’s released. It seems he isn't affected by the pain much even tho he says he's in pain and is tender on the head, and is in good condition. But we’ll see. Can u be tender on the head if u have brain hemorrhage that's not due to trauma? Sorry if questions are a bit silly :) 
Btw we don't have access to other blood values, just CRP, Hb, ESR, glukose and INR. Should have taken ESR too and INR I guess, but they can do that in the hospital too. 

Edit: just an update. They found nothing new or sign of infarct/bleeding in on CT. He was sent home with mild painkillers and unknown cause or as they said ""atypical symptoms of SAH"".

medicine,Need help coping with parents of patient,"As a peds resident, I've already seen my share of people who eschew vaccination and allopathic medicine in favor of alternative/natural medicine. However, today I had a particularly frustrating encounter. The quite young mother has a hx of polysubstance abuse (some during pregnancy) and significant psychiatric disease, and she adamantly refuses vitamin K and immunizations in general for her baby. I attempted a respectful, open ended conversation about vitamin K and she had no interest in talking about it. 

She also wanted her baby to be seen by a chiropractor and not a pediatrician in the future, despite the baby having significant health concerns (one of which was NAS). I left the encounter feeling like the mother was trying to give her child the worst chance in life possible, and disappointed that we could not even have a respectful conversation. I feel powerless.

Any advice on how to cope with these kinds of situations?

medicine,"Yet another ECG case, apologies to those oversaturated.","Older man who reports a longstanding history of palpitations with exertion and ?rheumatic fever history in his 20s (was in South America at the time).  Diagnosed with Afib as an outpatient about a week ago, starting taking metoprolol but was off and on due to a medical error which lead to overdosing with CP, bradycardia and fatigue and presented to an outside ED with continued palpitations.  

I don't have the ECGs from that ED as it was before I came on shift but per report HR was in the 160s and they gave him 20 mg IV dilt with no response, followed by another 10 mg which dropped his HR a little but also his BP.  Then got ~1.5 L of NS back, which dropped his sats so he then received 40 mg IV lasix. HR still not controlled so then got 0.5 mg of IV digoxin.

Transferred directly to our ED as HR was still in 160s.  

[Here are his ECGs](http://imgur.com/a/s0aSa).

Got 10 mg IV dilt x2 and gtt and repeat ECG as above and actually stabilized with HR in the 100s, satting fine off oxygen with normal BP.


I think this case is interesting because: 
(1) it highlights the occasional danger of IV diltiazem.   
(2) His second ECG was worrisome to me for a condition where AV nodal blockade with AF could be very dangerous.

EDIT:
Final underlying rhythm:
Afib/Flutter with aberrancy at higher rates. TTE showed EF of 28%, severe mitral regurg, likely functional from annular dilation, abnormal wall motion and restricted posterior leaflet.  

What I did: 
I am obviously not a cardiologist and am always looking to improve my ECG reading skills, which is partly why I like posting here.  The other reason is that if I think I'm going to be teaching it forces me to make sure I know what I'm talking about, otherwise someone here is going to easily call me out on BS. 

When he arrived to me, HR was in the 70s after the dig and additional dilt doses and he was on a gtt at 12.5 mg/hr.  I was concerned, falsely, whether this could be WPW with AF given all the different morphology of the QRS complexes in ECG #2.  But as some have pointed out those are just multifocal PVCs.  WPW with AF looks much differently.  I figured if he was going to have decompensated into VF he would have done so already, so I continued the dilt gtt and actually had to downtitrate it as the night went on. In retrospect, it was probably the digoxin he got in the ED that helped more than anything because after my shift ended he started creeping back up his HR into the 130s.  He was anticoagulated, placed on amiodarone and digoxin and TTE showed results as above. Cards didn't think elective cardioversion would likely be of much long term benefit due to his severe structural disease.

pharmacy,I want to kill myself. (New pharmacy grad),"Hi. I have struggled with mental health issues off and on throughout my undergrad years. I took a job in a rural town due to saturation issues (a problem which I'm sure you are all well aware). I entered pharmacy as a naïve student in my 2nd year of undergrad with limited volunteering experience in a small pharmacy with low volume and didn't work much throughout the years either.

The pharmacy I'm currently at is high volume for the region. I know the situation I'm in is not bad compared to a lot of classmates. The chain I'm with is reputable for treating its staff decently well. But even so, it's hard for me to handle the pressure. I have made numerous insurance billing mistakes along with lots of clerical errors that don't adhere to company policy. I feel like it's only a matter of time before I make a clinical error that kills someone and gets me sued and in debt for life.

I feel like I realized that pharmacy is not the right path for me and I have come home crying to my family/friends on Skype numerous nights in a row and it's only been a few weeks. I don't know if this is something anyone else struggles with. It feels like I'm being melodramatic because the situation I'm in is comparatively decent but all my mistakes are causing me a lot of anguish and I end up having suicidal thoughts as a result at night. I'm also alone in a town with a lot of old people and it feels like it's going to be difficult here finding friends my own age. My sleep has been suffering as well.

I don't know if I'm just ""soft"". Maybe I'm just weak. Does it ever get better? Should I switch career paths? Am I just too mentally ill to function in society?

Sorry for the rant.

tl;dr New grad. Not adjusting well. Mental health issues in the past. Suicidal thoughts arising again. Hoping to hear some words of wisdom from people who have been through similar issues.

EDIT: Thank you for the wisdom and kind words. Honestly, some days when I'm crying at home and totally alone with no one to talk to, I just re-read the experiences and powerful words you have all shared in this thread. I can't stress enough how much this has helped me get through the past tough weeks. Really appreciate it. Thank you, kind strangers.

An interesting issue came up today over at /r/medicalschool, in which a student stated they did not report a case of child abuse after the attending physician stated (something to the effect of) ""foster care would be worse.""

Myself and another person (/u/tibialisanterior) have been discussing whether or not medical students are individually designated as required reporters. We've both been using:

https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/manda.pdf#page=2&amp;view=Professionals

Some questions that got brought up:

-Only two states specifically address ""physicians-in-training""

-Are medical students considered ""medical professionals"" and/or ""medical practitioners?""

Anyone have experience with this issue?

Today one of them was caught stealing and could barely stand still when she came to drop off with four prescriptions for amphetamine salts, alprazolam, clonazepam and I forget what the fourth one was but it was also a controlled script. Sure enough, I looked at the prescribers name and it's the same local junkie psychiatrist. I asked my manager if she had noticed this prescriber always sends in drugged out patients who always ask to waive their copay and she goes ""oh yeah, we know about him, the doctor who worked there before him was under investigation by the DEA and fled the country. Good observation."" I dunno why this bothers so much but ugh, I don't understand how no one significant has caught  on to this guy?

medicine,What would you want social worker working in primary care to know?,"I'm a social worker who recently started a job working at a (non-profit) primary care medical practice. I work closely with the entire staff (pcp's, nursing, psych, case management, front end etc.) providing psychosocial support to the patients. I do a lot of crisis interventions, safety assessments/planning, depression/bi-polar/anxiety screenings, mental health psycho-education (no, you don't have bipolar disorder because your boyfriend says you're ""crazy and unstable.""), medication management support/coordination with the pcp's, and regular old psychotherapy with patients in the practice. 

This is my first time working in a medical setting so I come to you to ask you, the medical staff: In what ways could a social worker be of service to you?

medicine,For the surgeons out there - What qualities make a great OR Nurse?,"Hi all,

I'm an OR nurse at a large northeast hospital and am in the beginning stages of my training. Seeing as I work side by side with surgeons, residents and fellows for 8-12 hours a day, I wanted to pitch the following question and see what answers come up...


* **What qualities do you see in the OR nurses you enjoy being around the most? What qualities frustrate you in an OR nurse?**


Long story short, I really enjoy my job and the people and teams I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by regularly. As such, I'd like to improve the overall experiences of surgeries, not only for the patient, but the surrounding staff, medicine included. 


Thanks in advance for the help

pharmacy,Help re: Compound Vancomycin,"I know this is for people in the industry to vent but since it's Friday I'm hoping you won't mind my question. 

So my mom has a recurrence of C-diff and her doctor called in liquid Vanco to a compound pharmacy. She has taken this once before and it cost $4. It came in a bottle with a little syringe for her to measure her doses and it was cherry flavored...if that matters.

Yesterday I went to pick up the rx and was told insurance won't cover it and that it was $180. We really don't have that to be spending if we don't have to. Anyway, I asked why it couldn't be billed like last year when she took it and they said it's not prepared the same way. Fine.

I get home and open the box to find two bottles without seals inside a box that says First Vanco 50 Compounding Kit. One bottle of powder and one of Diluent grape flavored solution. 

I called her doctor to ask if I'm supposed to mix this myself and how would we know how much 5 ml is. He was shocked we were given this and told me to take it back to the pharmacy.

I understand CutisPharma has a patent on the compounding kit, but isn't that just for the kit? Could the pharmacist still have compounded this himself to save us money? If so do we have to keep this? He says he is not allowed because it's commercially available but I found a Walgreens that is a compound pharmacy and the pharmacist there said he could do it but it would take 3 days. 

Oh, also they put the wrong dosing instructions on the bottle. They put every 12 and it's supposed to be every 6 hours I found out.

medicine,Anyone know about medical genetics as a specialty?,"I have been wrestling back and forth for years about med school. I was really considering PA school but I just stumbled on to medical genetics. I had no idea that existed!! I work in a lab that runs a lot of diagnostic tests based on real time PCR, I like it but it isn't too stimulating, and I miss patient interaction of when I was doing phlebotomy.

So, wondering if anyone can answer some questions.

I love the idea of being able to get involved with research as an MD vs PA, but I don't like the current climate of getting a PhD. Plus I haven't done much actual research so I don't know if I want a whole career of it. I have always been fascinated by genetics. I had been contemplating going into psych, but I have always been fascinated by genetics and pharmacology, particularly how they play into mental health. I'm a non trad, although I'm only in my mid 20s, so not super non trad. I have my bachelor's in Bio already and haven't taken the MCAT yet since I keep changing my mind.

What is the lifestyle like for a Medical Geneticist? I am huge about having to be able to have a life outside of work. I need balance, especially since I have my own underlying mental health issues.

How do residencies work? Are they hard to get into? Do you have to do an IM residency first? Step score needed?

What is the salary like? I know you can be more academic based so I assume that pays less, but ideas of both mostly clinical and the academic side?

Job prospects? Is this a stupid field to do a residency in (ie the genetics fad could putter out in 20 years and on to the next big thing)

Is it worth doing the MD route for this or would a PhD be better? I like the idea of being able to work with patients and do some research related stuff. I could do like an MD/PhD, but I don't have the research experience to get in, so this is kind of an exciting prospect for me.",15,25,2016-07-23,PHARMA,0.03241138160228729,0.9315376281738281,0.036050986498594284

So I am kinda thinking about leaving my regular gig in order to move to a more urban place which is a heck of a lot closer to my family. I was searching online and found a position with an insurance company that's hiring, specifically in the prior auth department. I have an interview about a week or so from today. I have a few questions:

What exactly do you do most days? Are you constantly on the phone? On the computer? Are you stationary at a desk?

I know that this would be more site specific, but how stable are the hours. 9-5, M-F? Do you get weekends and holidays off?

How much are you guys making? I expect to take a bit of a hit but I don't know how much I am willing to drop. I would like to know a ballpark figure before the interview and offer (here's hoping).

How stressful is it? I used to work in a pretty high volume store as the only RPh on. It got pretty damn stressful at times. After a fun 12 hour day it might take me an hour or two at home to kinda decompress. Do you run into any of that? Is there anythings else that you would recommend that I know before my interview?

I don't really want to come off as pretentious but i also want to use the proper title.

pharmacy,New Technician having trouble with the Pharmacist.,"Hi /r/Pharmacy, I hope this is okay to post here! I'm hoping to find some help. This might look a mess but I've been pretty upset about this lately and am trying to be as specific as possible.

I am a new Pharmacy Tech (hired on 6/23). I work in a retail Pharmacy inside a grocery store. I spent the first week at their training center doing computer training. My first day working in the actual Pharmacy was July 4th, I worked 8 hours and the only thing I did all day was Product Dispensing. Easy peasy, no problems here. Because the Tech training me was sick, I did not work again until the 12th, four hours, again just product dispensing. On the 13th I work four hours again, but this time I am doing the register.

Last week I work on the 18th, four hours again, but because my trainer is sick again, all I'm doing is pretty much running the register. On the 18th I am with the Pharmacist and one other seasoned tech, closing. I ask the Pharmacist if there is anything I can improve on and things that I can do to help out that I might not think of. He tells me no and that cleaning would be helpful. All good, more than happy to.

On the 19th I come in to my trainer Tech telling me that the Pharmacist thinks that I am bad on the register (honestly not sure why, it wouldn't be so bad if I understood), that I seemed to be a slow learner because I like to write stuff down (physically writing down a process helps me to remember it), and because I ask too many questions. He thinks that I don't know enough, doesn't think I will work out and wants to consider letting me go. I was honestly very confused and inwardly upset. I told her I wasn't sure what he thought I was having trouble with regarding the register and, as for other things, I haven't learned them yet. She told me I should really try to simply remember things and to not ask him questions.

I worked Monday and Tuesday with a floater Pharmacist and another Tech, four hours, because my trainer is sick again. Other Tech (referred to as w) has been WONDERFUL. Taught me some RX intake, return to stocks, some data entry. Lots of things. W lets main Pharmacist know how much and how quickly I've learned, floater Pharmacists tells him how I saved his butt on the register, all sorts of stuff. Yay!

I go in today to fill in a shift for Trainer because she is sick. Trainer is there when I get there. Pharmacist, in the middle of the Pharmacy and very loudly asks trainer ""I'm not going to have any trouble out of that tonight am I?"" referring to me in the process. Youch. She says no and leaves. Later on, to a fill in tech from another store, he expresses his interest in having her transfer in and, while nodding to me with his head, also loudly in the middle of the pharmacy tells her ""He doesn't know how that is going to work out."" Again, ouch. Pharmacist pulls W into the office tonight to talk while I man the pharmacy.

Once closed W walks with me and lets me know Pharmacist wants to go ahead and get rid of me. He doesn't like me or my questions, etc. Says he is being unfair because I am untrained but they can't afford to let me go quite yet. W suggests that I try to transfer to another store so I can get actual training and be happy there.

What do I do here? I love the job, I feel like I'm picking it up quickly. I like the customers and my co-workers, but I simply can't take being treated in such a way every day. I try not to ask the Pharmacist questions but even when it's something he needs to do (patient counseling) he gets upset at me.

My fiance thinks that I need to report him for the comments, but I fear it would do nothing. I'd like to actually KEEP the job, even if I have to transfer to a new store, and trying to report him for anything seems like a bad way to do this. I'll admit I'm pretty sensitive, but I keep a straight face at work. Are a lot of Pharmacists like this and I just need to buck up? Any advice on how I can maybe turn his mind around about me?",20,33,2016-07-28,PHARMA,0.08106817305088043,0.889714777469635,0.029217122122645378

pharmacy,Pharmacy Around The World,"Hello!
I’m a 4th year pharmacy student from Finland and recently I’ve become curious about what pharmacy is like in other countries as a study subject and what is it like to work. I’d like to share some details what pharmacy is in Finland and maybe hear some of your stories from your home countries

Country: Finland, population 5,5 million.

Pharmacy studies: You can study pharmacy in two universities. Around 300 bachelor’s degrees ( 3 yr) and 80 master’s degrees (5 yr) are completed each year. The study fee is 125€/year. To be able to do the master’s degree you must score a higher amount of points in the entry exam than what is needed to apply for the bachelor’s degree. 

Salary: 1800€ /month for a pharmacy technician, 2300€ for a bachelor of pharmacy, 3400€ for a master of pharmacy. These are for community pharmacies. The manager makes around 5000-10000€/month but has a 55% tax due to the special legislation. 

Work:

Pharmacy technicians are responsible for logistics, cosmetic products, working at the cashier and organizing the shelves. They are not allowed to work with the prescriptions or talk about the OTC drugs. Their degree is 2 years long and not a university degree. 

Bachelors of pharmacy are the ones who do the customer service. They give advice regarding the patient’s medication and check the dose. They take the brunt of complaints from patients and generally keep the business running. 

Masters of pharmacy are the foremen. They take care of ordering products from wholesalers (There’s 2 main companies in Finland.) They make the work schedules and take care of the business side, sometimes they take part in customer service also.

Pharmacy managers own the pharmacies. To become a manager you need to have a master’s degree in pharmacy and around 10-15 years of working experience. When a pharmacy manager retires, the national authority Fimea (Finland’s FDA) opens the pharmacy for applications. Around 30-40 applicants send their CVs to the authority and the one with the longest working experience gets the pharmacy.  There are around 600 community pharmacies in Finland and a single pharmacy manager can own a maximum of 3 pharmacies.  There is significant pressure to change this system (for better or for worse). 

OTC:

Most common OTC drugs are as follows:

Pain relief: Ibuprofen 400 mg, Paracetamol 500 mg, ASA 500mg, Diclofenac 23,2mg/ml cream

Allergy: Cetirizine 10 mg, Loratadine 10mg, Fluticasone 50ug nasal spray

Diarrhea: Loperamide 2 mg,

Constipation:Lactulose 666mg/ml

Skin irritations: Dexpanthenol 50mg/ml cream

Nutrition: Vitamin D is very commonly used and also prescribed due to the very little sunlight we get in the winter. 
Probiotics are often recommended for those taking antibiotics. 

Flu: Xylometazone 1mg/ml, Dextrometorphan 3mg/ml

The newest drugs in the OTC category are Sumatriptan and Naproxen, both requiring a consultation with the pharmacist before buying.

Prescriptions:

There is a system of electronic prescription which is about to become mandatory for all prescriptions in 2017. The physician writes the prescription electronically and they are stored in a national database. The patient can collect his medication at any pharmacy by showing their ID. 
Controlled substances such as benzodiazepines and  are monitored more carefully and substances classified as narcotics, such as oxycodone have a separate log book. 
The prices of prescription and OTC drugs are controlled by the government. Every two weeks they update the pricelist and all the products and their generic variants are adjusted to the new price. 

Insurance:

Workers are covered by the legislation. Every worker is secured in case a malpractice or sueing.
Patients are also covered by a national insurance. The patient pays a small part of the price of the drug and the pharmacy is responsible for getting its own back from the social service. For example a patient buys Nexium generic  100 tabl. for 24€. The insurance pays 40 % so he pays 14,40€ at the cashier and the pharmacy later collects the remaining 9,60€ from social services.
The insurance is divided into three parts.

Most non-vital medicines such as PPI drugs, NSAIDS, antibiotics, eye gels, lotions for skin diseases are insured so that 40 % of the price of the drug is paid by the insurace.

More necessary drugs such as anti-rheumatic drugs, asthma inhalers, blood pressure drugs, gout drugs and hypercholesterolemia drugs are 65 % paid by the insurace.

The most vital drugs are 100 % paid by the insurace. These are insulins, cancer drugs, orphan drugs and epilepsy drugs among others. 

Lastly there is a limit to how much you pay per year. After you have bought insurance-covered drugs up to 610€, all remaining purchases for the year cost 2,50€ per purchase.

Future views:

There has been a lot of discussion in Finland whether our system should be changed so that larger chains and groceries could open their own pharmacies and that OTC drugs should be moved more into the grocery stores themselves.  

There is even talk that the controlled pricing should be changed so that all pharmacies can choose their own prices. This would be to increase the competition and reduce drug costs. How is this done in your country? Can a pharmacy have, for example, a Cancer Weekend Special discount where patients are encouraged  to buy from a specific pharmacy?

My own gripe is that there is no clinical pharmacy in Finland at all. I’ve read that in other countries, pharmacists may even discuss with the physician about the patient’s medication even beyond simple ”there was an error with the dose” – manner.

Finally, the bear decides that threats are not enough.  He goes to the end of the bar and attacks a woman who had been sitting there all day.  The bear eats the woman completely and after the last swallow, he goes back over to the bartender and says, ""Okay.  What about now?  Think you might reconsider and get me that beer?""

The bartender looks up at the bear and says, ""Well now I have another reason not to serve you.  You're on drugs.""

The bear snarls at the bartender and says, ""What makes you think I'm on drugs!?""
