medicine,A naturopath is coming to speak to my class. What questions should I ask him?,"I'm in a pre-med program at my university and the program directors have arranged a seminar series. This Wednesday we have a naturopathic doctor coming in to speak to us. This is his website: http://www.david-house-productions.com/House-of-David/index.html

EDIT:
The talk was pretty interesting. A major point of his presentation was that the philosophy of the majority of naturopaths is to follow allopathic medicine - treating symptoms with herbal remedies. Instead, he said a person should be looked at as a whole - a conglomeration of the soul, spiritual as well as emotional mind, and body and that disturbances with the soul and mind can cause disease on the body. He harped on the body's capability of treating itself and mentioned his own affliction with myasthenia gravis and how he was cured of it through a ""dialogue"" session with a naturopath doctor. The session revealed to him the self-deprecation and mental abuse he put on himself as he was a perfectionist and through the session was able to let go of this continuous need to be perfect - and now free of symptoms of the disease.

He did mention the disclaimer that allopathic medicine is the necessary course of treatment in certain diseases: especially in emergency trauma, care of very young and very old.

medicine,Are East Asian babies more susceptible to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) if their mothers drank occasionally during pregnancy?,"Many East Asians lack the enzyme aiding in the metabolism of alcohol.

Recently, Dr. Yvonne Kelly from University College London headed a study which showed no adverse effects of mothers having one or two glass of wine per week while pregnant. As the study is London based, I'm guess the sample population are not East Asians, and therefore does not have trouble metabolising alcohol.

So, are there similar studies done for East Asian mothers? Will occasional drinks during pregnancy affect East Asians differently due to the lack of the ALDH2 enzyme?",2,3,2011-10-01,PHARMA,0.05236092209815979,0.8696376085281372,0.07800140231847763

Health,FYI: Vitamin D helps keep Pilonidal Cysts low-tempered.,"I'm a pretty big guy that's incredibly hairy. I'm not horribly active and don't go out too often. I have a pilonidal cyst with several sinus drains. It was super annoying and hurt a ton. The doctor told me it probably wasn't worth the effort to remove. I went to visit my fianceé and we spent a good deal of time out doors. I noticed that the bigger sinus was going away! I was so happy. It used to feel like a flap, and now it was a tiny dried up nub. When I went back home, I noticed the drain came back. I was so pissed. But then I decided to think out what the difference was. I came to the conclusion it was Vitamin D. To test my theory, I started taking Vitamin D suppliments. To my surprise, the drain went away! I stopped taking the Vitamin D and it came back. I then started to take it again, and it went away. It was magical. I then found out that I had a Vitamin D diffency. So, if you have a pilonidal cyst that's annoying but not worth removing, try Vitamin D!

medicine,Let's talk about stethoscopes.,"Howdy!

I've been looking at getting a new stethoscope and while manufacturers are very detailed in their item descriptions, I think real experience weighs more. Therefore, I'd like to hear about your experiences with stethoscopes!

Personally, I've only ever used the Littmanns, both the Cardiology II SE and the III. I've been looking at getting my hands on a Harvey Elite based on [this link](http://forums.studentdoctor.net/showpost.php?p=3289972&amp;postcount=15), though I don't know of anyone that carries one so I can try it beforehand(Littmann stethoscopes are like the TI calculators here in Sweden, completely dominating the market!) or an original Cardiology II.

Health,I need some closure :(,"Hey guys. About two months ago my grandmother died right in front of me while we were on vacation. One day after her 66th birthday. I'm an EMT so I did CPR on her to no avail. I just received her autopsy results via email and I was wondering if a Doctor or other knowledgeable medical person could help me understand all/some of it.

I don't know what else to say. I just need to understand it.

    1)  Status post perimortem cardiopulminary resuscitation efforts
 
    2)  Only trauma:  Bilateral chest fractures, #'s 2 through 6 anterolaterally, consistent with CPR efforts.
This makes sense, I broke her ribs.
 
    3)  Atherosclerosis:
      a) Moderately severe, ulcerative and calcific, of aorta and major branches
      b) Severe left anterior descending and right coronary arteries and moderate of left circumflex 
         coronary artery, with focal posterior left ventricular scarring and large posteroseptal and 
         posterior interventricular septal acute myocardial infarction.
We were told she had a bad heart attack. Posterior left ventricular scarring points to a previous undiagnosed heart attack? The last part of that sentence. Does that mean she had two separate MI's the night she died?
 
    4)  Moderately severe arterionephrosclerosis of kidneys
Related to atherosclerosis?
 
    5)  Suggestion of early cirrhosis of the liver
Liver scarring
 
    6)  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mild to moderate
Smoking &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

 
    7)  Prominent kyphoscoliosis of upper thoracic verterbral column, with arthritic 
        changes of cervical vertebral column.
Her daughter (my mother) has scoliosis. I never knew my grandmother did.
 
    8)  Uncomplicated diverticulosis of large bowel

She was a heavy smoker and drank a decent amount of alcohol. She wasn't very healthy. Weighed 123 lbs.

medicine,Fuck you antipsychiatry!!,"Hey Redditors docs, nurses and everybody else, 

Just wanted to share my thoughts about Psychiatry and my journey towards it...

Anyway, I'm a medical student at present and entering my final year. (in ON, Canada) I did pretty well in my rotations (not boasting, just stating the facts) so am able to choose between various specialties such as Internal Medicine, Psychiatry, Family Medicine. I came into medical school wanting to do Psychiatry because I particularly enjoyed working closely with patients and people, and personally feel that Mental Illness can be far more devastating than other types of illness. During my undergrad years, I got the opportunity to do research and witness clinical psychology. I could see how Mental Illness could tear families up, how patients also have to deal with stigma and how Mental Illnesses can often become the biggest priority. Sure some patients may also have heart disease and diabetes, but the schizophrenia when uncontrolled leads to them not taking their pills and a downward spiral culminating in disaster. Then when I see how most patients with mental illness get ripped on by family members and society in general I feel like helping them all the more (Of course some family members are supportive thankfully) I see mentally ill patients with addictions and schizophrenia on the street as homeless people and I feel sad that sometimes they're seen as bums not as patients without care.

Anyway, in medical school and in society I keep picking up a negative perception towards mental illness. My family members keep trying to persuade me to pick internal medicine and do cardiology or GI given my good reference letters from internal medicine preceptors. They feel that the good pay is worth it and at least I get respect from society.  Even within medicine, other students tell me not to pick Psychiatry as I won't be paid nearly as much as the more lucrative specialties such as Gastroenterology. And I won't have to put up with society's bullshit and demonization. (I keep hearing from random knowitalls how Psychiatry and Psychology is pseudo science)

Yet somehow, I still wanted to do Psychiatry. I wanted to help the vulnerable patients who have mental illnesses and make a difference in their lives. I wanted to care for them and do my part to make their lives meaningful and productive. Yet, repeatedly I get battered by people: Emergency doctors, people in the street, family members....all these people give me negative reactions when I say I wanna be a Psychiatrist. (Its like telling somebody you're gay...there's so much goddamn stigma)

I came really close to not picking Psychiatry. I'm smart, I have lots of options. Why pick a specialty where society doesn't give a shit? Why pick a specialty where I don't get paid as much as the big buck specialties? Why pick a specialty where people like Tom Cruise and his scientology cronies try to make me look like an evil person? 

Anyhow, I turned to the internet to try and find if anybody even appreciated Psychiatry, and I stumbled upon hundreds and hundreds of hate sites. Some christian zealots, scientologists, disgruntled patients, random armchair scientists (e.g. Joe Blow who took a psychology course and now is an expert on the latest scientific research. Josh Fuckwit who has a friend for whom drug treatment didn't apparently work so he knows for sure shrinks are quacks)....and so on. And I got more and more angry with them all as a whole. I was ready to write off Psychiatry as a career. 

But then again every now and then, I meet people who remind me that Psychiatry is a meaningful career.  And they remind me why I want to be a shrink. Because its a meaningful career. And the drugs work!!!! We don't necessarily know why, but we do know they work! And as anybody in medical school knows, not all medical treatment results in instant effective cures. Even if we stent patients or replace valves, patients still die in around 6-10 years from cardiac pathology. We aren't God (yet). There is no effective ""cure"" for CHF or Diabetes. We can do a Whipples procedure but patients will still most prolly die if they have Pancreatic cancer. Similarly in Psychiatry, we can help with symptom management and ease lives, but we may not be able to effectively wipe out the disease. But we can drastically improve lives.

Anyway, I'm going to do Psychiatry. I know I'm smart and I hope I can bring changes to my patients lives. I know the job is meaningful. I'm going to try to do my bests to counter the antipsychiatry efforts.  (I'm really mad at them for confusing people about Psychiatry. Anybody who thinks they have depression who types up psychiatry usually finds some junk articles which purport psychiatry to be some kind of organized scam. I wonder how many suicides are a direct result of misinformation and patients being confused about seeking help) The internet is honestly a terrible place to find information about medical treatment, particularly with Psychiatry. You have idiots spending hours putting up antipsychiatry webpages that always end up popping up on Google and resulting in misinformation. 

Anyway, I'm ranting. I'm gonna be a Psychiatrist. I'm gonna do my best to help patients with mental illnesses. Antipsychiatrists can hate. But the career is meaningful. I am picking this career because as a doctor, I can help people with mental illness. I don't know what antipsychiatrists offer patients other than hate and despair. I shall offer them help to the best of todays scientific knowledge.  

And another thing: All these behavioural psychologists and psychodynamic theorists who demonize drug treatment may have a vested interest in promoting psychotherapy over drug therapy. They can't prescribe... just consider that folks before citing psychology research studies that say that drugs don't work. There's a place for drug treatment and there's a place for psychotherapy. Usually there's a place for both. When a patient shows up floridly psychotic in the emergency department, you can't talk to them. You have to medicate and once the patient is stabilized you can start working on psychotherapy. 

Anyway, I hope for a better future for mental illness. One where antipsychiatry fucktards (who most probably don't believe in evolution either...) don't confuse and demonize mentally illness patients and those who dedicate their lives to studying them. Regardless, I shall fight the good fight. They can call me evil all they want, but I will do my bit to help mentally ill patients. And I'm not doing it for the money. I could have just done gastroenterology or something and made far more money. 

Anyway, I hope all you other medical professionals....cardiologists, gastroenterologists, family doctors, surgeons, nurses, paramedics.... take the time and trouble to destigmatize mental illness when you have the chance. If you hear some fucktard on the street put down the study and treatment of mental illness, call them out for acting like a dumb ass. Ask the antipsychiatrists what they offer patients who feel suicidal. Education is key to combating mental illness. 

Anyway, I'm just tired about all the antipsychiatry bullshit I keep hearing. I'm jaded without even entering the Psychiatry profession. I just wanted to hear from all the other medical professionals. Hopefully supportive comments and that others believe that mental illness should be studied and treated. And that Psychiatry isn't as people say bullshit. I also hope that nonmedical people stumble upon this post and hear what the medical community has to say about Psychiatry.

Health,At the end of my rope and extremely frustrated.  I need some advice.,"First off, I've seen tons of doctors, but to no avail.  The US system sucks for diagnosing anything, but the very obvious.  I don't think this is doctors' fault, they are just so jammed with patients and don't have a lot of time to investigate.  

My problem is as following.  I'm 30 and for the last 9 years, I've been suffering from crippling pain between in my chest (mid-sternum) and between my shoulder blades.  It starts out as a pressure feeling that builds up until it's extremely painful.  When it gets really bad, my neck and face will swell up.  The swelling will always be on the side that hurts and has gotten bad enough that I cannot button the top button of collared shirts.  The pain is more prevalent on the right side, but I also get it on the left.  When I lie on the side it hurts, it feels like I am putting pressure on the painful spot and it hurts worse.  Also, when the pain is really bad, my whole upper body trembles.  The pain itself ebbs and flows with the day, but a flare up can last for weeks.  The two things I've noticed help it somewhat is deep meditative breathing (although the inhalation actually hurts) and cardiovascular exercise.  

I've been to tons of doctors and specialists at great expense.  None has been able to give me a diagnosis.  In a few cases, they have guessed and said it's costochondritis or GERD, but the remedies have provided no relief.  All serious cardiac issues have been ruled out.  The attitudes of the doctors have been that they are sorry this is happening, but they have no answers for me and I just have to live with it.  The only problem is that the pain gets so bad, I'll spend days curled up on the couch in the fetal position unable to move.  At other times, I take heavy pain medication and am a zombie.  Occasionally, I seem to go into spontaneous remission when after the pain has built up to ungodly levels, I feel a very powerful and sudden popping sensation in my chest.  Actually, it feels like something explodes.  Within 20 minutes, my neck and facial swelling go down.  My GF was absolutely shocked when she saw this happen.  Unfortunately, I have no idea how to make this happen.  

I am frustrated and don't know what to do at this point.  I've seen so many doctors and gotten nowhere.  The problem also seems to be getting worse, not better.  Can anyone give me some advice on different ways I can deal with this issue, both physically and psychologically.  I feel like a drag on everyone around me.  I just want this pain to go away.  I ended up having to get fit with a mouthguard because I was grinding my teeth away.  

I am going to see my doctor again, because this is the first time the swelling has gotten so bad I couldn't button my collar.  However, the swelling has come down mostly since then, so I'm not sure this will help him.

Health,Scary Episode at Wal-mart,"I've been trying to figure out what the heck happened to me. Here are the details. 

I've been prescribed Effexor for anxiety, been on it for about a month. Also recently (3 days ago) started taking Zopiclone for sleep disruption due to the Effexor. Not many side effects besides the sleep, loss of appetite, and some diarrhea the last day. 

I wasn't feeling awesome today, but I had some errands to run. Around 3pm, I took the bus to the mall- felt really tired and attributed it to residual drowsiness from the Zopiclone. 

Walking through the mall, I started to feel funny. A little light-headed and nauseous. I sat down for a few minutes then felt a bit better and walked to Wal-mart through the mall. 

Shopping was ok, got to the cashier and suddenly felt a wave of heat through my body. I felt like I was going to throw up, faint and shit my pants all at the same time. The cashier seemed like she was going in slow motion. Somehow I began to pay with my debit card. I started having a body tremor- shaking as I tried to type in my information into the pin pad. I couldn't really read the words and felt like I was falling asleep between each button push as my head got lower and lower and I started dripping sweat . The cashier gave me my receipt and asked if I was ok. I said ""no"" &amp; went to the bathroom, relieved myself, continued shaking and sweating for a minute or so. Then I sat on a bench for a few minutes and felt a bit better and went home. 

The episode was really scary to me. I have never lost control of my body that way. The cashier told me she thought I was having a mini-stroke because of the tremors. That freaked me out a lot. 

I have no idea what happened. I am assuming it is a side effect of the new med, but the Zopiclone should have been long out of my system by 4pm. 

What do you think, Reddit? Anything like this ever happen to you? Does this episode ring any bells?

Health,Anybody suffering from Derealization/Depersonalization?,"I am fairly certain that i am suffering from the mentioned conditions. Long story short: I have done numerous drugs throughout my high school years (ridiculous amounts of cough medicine, alcohol, marijuana, painkillers, speed, some ecstasy), and i am now suffering as a consequence of my bad decisions. 

The worst part is the Derealization/Depersonalization i mentioned. The reason i firmly believe that i am indeed suffering from these specific conditions is because of the spaced out, alien feeling i get most days. To clarify, the alien feeling i mentioned is basically me not feeling connected to the world as i should. I will look at objects (such as trees), and feel weird about them. It is very difficult to describe exactly how i feel when observing these objects. It's almost as if i have a sense of not belonging to the world. The feeling i get from the sense of not belonging makes me worried, which in turn ends up scaring me and escalating my anxiety. The anxiety i have is irrational, stupid, and makes people around me not understand what the hell is wrong with me. For example, i tend to avoid certain situations altogether if i can, such as raising hands in class, public speeches in class (this literally makes me sweat, shake, and almost pass out), etc. However, i can go to a bar with a group of friends and have no problems. Also, i can spark up conversations with people and not feel anxiety at all. It angers me to end that my anxiety is spontaneous and unexpected. It  can strike at anytime. One day i can raise my hand and ask the teacher whatever and not even think twice, and other days i become terrified at the very same thought. Something that i have come to realize is that i become far more anxious when my Derealization/DP is ongoing. The days that i can ask questions and not feel anxiety are the days where i feel most like a normal person, aka not insane/out of this world/not belonging/alien. 

It is very hard for me to get help as i am on my mother's limited benefit insurance, and it is not quite the best insurance out there. On top of that, i am going through some very stressful legal issues at the moment ,and also paying for school, so regular doctor visits are hard to accomplish. I have gone to a psychiatrist (and neurologist) in my country (Moldova) over the summer, and they seem to have come to the conclusion that my brain chemicals are depleted/mixed up and that is why i am suffering. I was prescribed Clomipramine (a tryciclic antidepressant) which i initially took 50mg of, and up to a 100mg by the peak of the treatment (which in total lasted two months). On top of the prescribed antidepressant, i was also taking Vitamin B1, B6, and B12 injections (10 of each for a month, so 30 total), as well as a nootropic, Phezam (Piracetam 400mg and Cinnarizine 25mg) 3 times a day, Taurine 500mg per day, and Vitamin A 100,000 UI per day and finally Vitamin E (0.1g) per day. 

The treatment ended up taking roughly 2 months total, and was definitely successful. For starters, i felt far happier than usual. For instance, i would drive during a sunny day and see nature (trees, flowers, etc) and simply feel happiness at the sight of them; something that i haven't felt in years. I would also strongly want to mention that when i say happiness, i mean true happiness. Happiness that i remember feeling as a child, and not the fake happiness that fills a certain void. I really hope somebody here knows what i am talking about. It's the type of happiness that makes me feel happy to simply be alive and enjoy simply being, other than the type of happiness i get from buying a new gadget, or something similar. Other than the happiness, one other very important benefit from the treatment was the lack of the alien feeling i mentioned before. I felt far more connected to the world, and felt a strong sense of belonging. I could also analyze situations very quickly and things seemed to just connect together. For example, one major aspect of DR/DP that always bothered me was the tunnel vision. When driving, (or walking, etc) i could only seem to concentrate on  the object right in front of me. Even when sitting down, i had to fully look in every single direction and focus my attention to individual objects before i could get a clear picture of the situation. During the treatment, however, i would take me no longer than a split second or two to get a picture of  the whole scenario. It's like i could concentrate on things happening everywhere easily, without even requiring any thought. I feel that this is due to the depersonalization/derealization being subdued. I want to stress that i didn't feel superhuman or anything, but rather normal, as i remember feeling a long time ago. I just  don't want anybody to think that i was normal to begin with, and then bring on the treatment made me superhuman, because that is certainly not the case. When i say tunnel vision, i don't mean it in vain. It's horrible, and i wouldn't wish it upon anyone. It's something that makes me feel like a very slow individual and it scares me, which brings me light panic attacks/anxiety. That's why i feel that all of my conditions are connected. The only way i can explain it is that i feel extremely spaced out and not concentrated at all.  Whenever i start to feel the spaced out/alien feeling, the anxiety starts to kick into high gear. It becomes so bad that it feels that i have concentrate on just staying AWAKE, which takes a huge toll on my mentality. Imagine having to try to just EXIST. It's that bad. The depression is just the cherry on top. Unfortunately, i started feeling down again after having completed the treatment. It seems that it may not have been long enough or powerful enough. I felt excellent while on it, but nowhere near as good after having finished it. I am currently on another treatment, which is pretty much pointless and nowhere near as effective as the previous one. I am on Rexetin (paxil) 40mg per day as well as some gingko balboa. I also took (for a few weeks) 1mg of alprazolam per day (.5mg morning and .5 night), and while on it, i felt that my anxiety was definitely far lighter. However, that feeling went away as soon as i finished my alprazolam tablets. Also, while the anxiety might have been much better (as in, not as bad), i didn't  feel as happy as i did on the previous treatment.

I apologize for the long, rambled mess. I usually type far more eloquently, but at this moment i can't seem to gather my thoughts correctly and words just aren't flowing as smoothly as they usually do. I only hope that somebody on this board either has experience on the subject matter or has gone (going) through what i am currently going, so that they could provide some sort of assistance. I don't know what to do. 

**TL;DR** I am suffering from depression, anxiety, Derealization/Depersonalization and it's taking a huge toll on my life. I find it very difficult to enjoy very simply things in life, and it is hard for me to feel happiness. I have very bad anxiety (which seems to escalate from the spaced out feeling i get from the DR/DP) which takes an even greater toll on me as i cannot do simple things such as public speaking or raising my hand in class at times. Some days i feel better, but 90% of the time it sucks. I am 100% certain that this is the direct result of me taking ridiculous amounts of cough medicine, alcohol, and other drugs while in my high school days. For anybody who doubts that drugs could affect them, let my example prove you otherwise. You have no idea how difficult it is right now, at the ripe age of 21 to be going through this.",6,4,2011-10-12,PHARMA,0.11620019003748894,0.8560655415058136,0.027734283357858658

Health,Question about needles/IV,"Having a discussion with friends/coworkers about fear of needles/giving blood, etc:

Background: at one point I was in the hospital for chest pains (and an overreacting mother).  During this, I was hooked up to a pulse/bp machine.  They wanted to put an IV in my arm for one of the tests (something about a dye to check for blockage).  I asked the nurse to lay me down because I usually get light headed.  She said I'd be fine.

When they put the needle in, all the alarms go off.  My BP crashed (I saw --/--) and my pulse went to 30.  I stayed conscious and could hear but my vision went dark.  A minute later I was fine, but felt really flush and was pale.

I said I don't really like to give blood because I don't react well to needles.  My friends say I have a severe case of ""being a pussy.""

The needles don't cause extreme pain or anything, just that light headed feeling.  So is there a medical reason this happens, or some way it can be avoided (one friend suggested it might be dehydration, so drinking water beforehand), or are they right and I'm just chicken?

**tl:dr** is there a medical reason your bp/pulse crash when you get an IV/needle, or is it purely mental/anxiety/fear?",7,8,2011-10-13,PHARMA,0.0675610825419426,0.9032596945762634,0.029179241508245468
Health,"Might this be tinnitus, and if so, why does it only occur in one place?","For a couple of months now I've been noticing an off and on ringing sound, mostly on the right side, and ONLY when in my bedroom. I've done the unplug-everything-plug-it-back-in-one-at-a-time thing. Nothing seems to correlate with it. It sounds like a cross between a fluorescent light hum and the fridge motor cycling on. My husband doesn't hear it. I also have allergies and sinus problems off/on, but right now my symptoms are pretty mild. I've tried sitting in other 'quiet' rooms and it doesn't happen. Usually I notice it at night, but once or twice it's been in the AM. 

Signs it's tinnitus: only I hear it, sounds like what I've heard it sounds like, only on one side. 

Signs it's got to be something else: It's only in the freakin' bedroom! 

I wish it would happen here at the office or in another room at home so I could just finally say ""yea, I know what it is"" and start dealing with it. 

In the absence of other theories, I'll probably just wait until my physical in a few months to bring it up to my MD, but if someone has another idea, please share. 

**UPDATE** It's me. I tried the fingers-in-the-ear trick last night. I actually didn't hear anything as I was going to bed. Put my fingers blocking my ears anyway... .and I heard it. In my left ear. It got louder the more I tried it. Let go, and it went away. This made me a bit aware that I did kinda hear a very quiet ringing that is more like white noise. This AM in the bathroom I didn't hear any ringing and blocked my ears. I heard an increase in ringing in my left ear. Let go and it went away. 

Thanks all for the ideas. I'll look into Gingko (although I'm allergic to so many plant based things I can't even take echinacea products) and I've heard CoQ10 can also be helpful. It's not that annoying at the moment, so I'll ask my PCP at my next physical in a few months. We'll see if it might be my allergies contributing w/ fluid in ears or if it's likely nerve based.

This while still managing to be part of patient care. (Dont really want to be a background guy in a sense) I want to be able to work with a team. 

I would compromise a little of any of these things if it could be in some sub-specialty in surgery. (Obviously not possible with what Im asking, but what would be the closest thing even if by far.)",53,12,2011-10-14,PHARMA,0.02687564678490162,0.924356997013092,0.04876736178994179

You see, i have minor tourettes syndrome, which causes me to do things, movements and sounds, that are outside my will... 
These things are called 'ticks'.
I have had a tick that started this year, which makes me bite down hard on the back of my tongue..
After days and days, sometimes i can build the energy to over power the urges to do it, and others it gets way too painful. So painful that it often leaves me depressed with no motivation to brush my teeth or maintain oral hygene...
I have had a few periods this year where i havent brushed for long periods of time..
I am trying as hard as i can as of today to maintain my oral hygene.
Do you guys have any advice for me as to extra steps i could take?
The surrent status of my gums: i have gingivitis.. i often get it here and there when i do brush though, but at the moment when i brush almost everywhere bleeds :(
I would really like to hear your thoughts on this, and would really appreciate any motivation i gain :)
Im sorry if you are thinking that teeth brushing is a simple task and im stupid not to do it, but if you could only step into my shoes and see how things really are you would understand..
Thanks anyway guys.
I will really appreciate responses regarding both oral hygene and TS.

medicine,I'm a medical student who really doesn't like most medical students that I know.  Here's why.,"An intro.  I go to an MD school that provides a direct BS/MD program in 6 years (people are accepted right out of high school).  In our year, over 50% of students have one or both parents that are doctors, and out of a class of 105, maybe 10-15 have an actual interest in pursuing a carreer in primary care.  

I'm not here to bash people who don't want to do primary care--if you love it, and it's your thing, do it.  What I will say that it's quite disgusting that most of these medical students, from the moment they put their coat on at the beginning of M1 year, get an air of superiority to them that I cannot comprehend.  I often joke that distributing white coats to people at the beginning of school is aquin to distributing a halloween costume.  I remember that back buring my first year (COME BACK!  I DONT WANNA GO TO THE CLINIC ANYMORE!!!) the dean of the College of Medicine spoke to our class, telling us that we should act professional at even our worst while wearing the coat.  I say this first because I feel it's a good place to draw some analogies from.

One of the core concepts of patient care is the ability to relate to patients.  To try to empathize, maybe sympathize.  Everytime you take an interview, you listen to one's story.  Of course, in practice things get speeded up and if you're on your FP rounds you'll have close to half the time you'd expect to conduct an interview, but to be effective, from my experience and the words of many professionals I have encountered, taking an interest in the patient, not judging them, and actually listening to what they're telling you is the flat out most effective method.  Evidence Based studies actually prove that it is more effective at obtaining everything from a complete sexual history to identifying malingering. 

With that in mind, let me introduce you to girl 'A.'  Both of her parents were cardiologists, one of them actually associated with the school, and she was a shoo in at admissions (anyone who thinks that at least 20% of people in med school are NOT there as some sort of favor are sadly mistaken, at least from my observations and what others have said (both online and at various conferences where I meet other students)).  She worked at a high-end clothing botique in college, used a 'bible' (a literal collection of old tests) to pass nearly every class, failed her MCAT 3 times (she couldn't get the base score in the mid-20's, which is OBSCENELY low btw, to be guaranteed into the medical school half of our program; her 4.0 in college was 100% cheating).  First patient interview?  As soon as it was done, mentioned that the guy was wearing ratty old clothes and said 'he probably is too stupid to understand me explaining things to him anyways.'  Also, while I'm on the subject, I have actually seen her at Wal-Mart, on a day where first year student's DIDN'T have to wear their med coats, in her white coat.  I thought to myself 'wow...she must really like wearing it.'  Man I was wrong.  It's a common appearance in my town seeing people from the med school running around in their white coats, literally dressed up in public as a doctor just for the recognition.  It got to be such an issue I know the Deans actually sent several people emails regarding 'appropriate use of their academic regalia.'  It just starts there.

Almost NOBODY in my school wants to do primary care?  Why?  Money.  It all comes down to money/playing doctor to these kids, and it's sick that the most money hungry ones I know come from the richest families.  Some of them STILL cheat in medical school (MGB brought in a paper with ALL the equations and a nephron diagram into the test, and I know people at my school know my reddit name, so yeah MGB, you make me sick.  I worked my ass off on that test and you did as well as me for shit and now your PATIENTS get to pay for it).  The vast majority of people I talk to are openly picking their specialties just because of money.  And you know what?  FINE!  I GET IT!  Some people in schools are always going to play those odds.  But the vast majority???  Eh....cringeworthy at worst, I say.

I don't want to ramble, but since I started, if your criteria for a quality doctor was actual desire to help the patient, most of these people are simply too immature to even meet that.  They don't seek at all to define their interests in the field, nor to they seek to grow in understanding humanity (it's amazing how little people we have volunteering to help out underserved drug addicts in our area via a program.  It's amazing too that about half the people doing it are just doing it to make their resume sound good).  ""Oh great!  You just got elected to an officer position in the give hope organization (helps the terminally ill).  What are you gonna do with it?""  ""Put it on my resume.""  ""Yeah, but like....events and stuff...?""  ""Naw...well if they make me, but my CV has to look good.""

I guess that's the pattern now, though.  EVERYTHING revolves around CV's, nothing around passion.  I am different from most typical medical students, and I'm not saying that's a positive or negative....maybe I just don't see what they see with certain issues.  My mom gave Eminem's a run for her money, and I grew up in a shithole enviornment for close to 13 years.  I never had the funds to get a nosejob at 17 for a 'prom present.'  I can't grasp the complete and total apathy amongst medical students....everything most of the people in my year do they do for themselves.  There's nothing wrong with boosting your CV to get a good residency, I get that completely, but why on earth do you have to seemingly exploit the system to do things?  Specialties are supposed to draw people (idealistically) by their passion and specific talents...I find it simply AMAZING that the people with a passion for cardiology have such a common background: rich with at least one parent in the field.  Really, what better way to explore one's own interests is there than clubs/organizations/shadowing.  It's great all those look good on a CV, but I have such a problem for the lack of enthusiasm for all but prestige/getting paid associated with pursuing these things.

Fun fact:  Most of the people who want to get into those specialties are often taken aboard in whatever hospital their parent's work in/get majority of referrals from.  If you look at the stats for our board scores (speciafically from our school) the standard deviation is UNREAL.  Also, the people who don't get their dream specialty, when forced into primary care (quoting a recently graduated PGY1 here) 'kind of suck doing a PCP residency (he's OBGYN).'

TL;DR:  I wish med students would start doing things because they want to make a difference, not to get rich, gloat, and build their CV.

TLDRmeta: If you go to my school and you read this, know I don't hate you, but if you act like this I truly don't respect your motives and the way you go about achieving things.  Look, I know POMS sucks, Infectious Disease scarred your mind with STD images, and it's not gonna get easier until you're an attending/fellow....but take some time to find what you love.  I'm not the only one who sees this.  None of you are dumb, and even if you are here on a favor, you have more potential than most people will ever dream of to change an untold amount of lives.  You have the pen to rewrite a couple lines in a really scary chapter for a future patient's book...for a moment, stop worrying about all the things associated with being a doctor, and try to be more like what a doctor should be.  I know I sound idealistic, but we are the epitome of HCW's in America...if we can show the core values of medicine can still exist in a changing landscape and put the patient first, perhaps we can start identifying true problems within the system and fix it.  

Why can't we just be doctors again?  I eat very well on my student loan money....if your knowledge and passion can impact someone's life and you love what you do...there's really not that much of a change between 150 and 200k.  And if a fractal pay increase at that high of a base level will make you deny your talents and and passion in the field....you probably shouldn't be in the fiels anyways.",58,75,2011-10-16,PHARMA,0.0646672435104847,0.9066799879074097,0.028652727603912354

Health,Got sent home from work today as my Eczema is now out of control. Have you guys got any success stories/advice to share? Wisdom bombs needed,"Had mild eczema all my life, tried some steroid creams, all the moisturisers in the world, hemp creams, organic wonder-creams...

Woke up today with a swollen face, including eyelids. Entire arms (the tips of my fingers to the upper bicep) are covered, and have been seeping. Can't move my head as my neck is seeping and scarred. Flaking skin everywhere, extremely self-conscious and becoming an obstruction of progressing with my daily life. At least I *tried* to work today.

My GP prescribes me Aqueous creams, bath-ointments, emulsifying agents every time - reluctant to give me a steroid based solution (understandingly) but its beyond the point where I'm worried about its side effects now. Tried to call today to get another appt so I can pretty much demand to see a Dermatologist but their phone line was down.

I know there are ridiculously bad cases of Eczema out there, but this isn't a competition - it's broken out a few times in my life but nothing this bad, other than that its usually just on my hands, nick and eyes so a little easier to hide. So this is way outside of my comfort zone.

Would love to hear some success stories (even if its not eradicated, just working/helping) or anything else to help make me not lose hope. And generally to feel not alone with this problem I guess!",56,14,2011-10-18,PHARMA,0.0641091987490654,0.9034220576286316,0.0324687585234642
medicine,8 years ago I got a BA in arts. Now I want to go to med school. Where do I start?,"I'll point out that I'm doing plenty of research on the matter on my own, but I was curious if anyone here has had a similar experience.

Long story short, when I was in college I avoided math and science - not because I wasn't good at it, but because I didn't think I'd ever have a use for it. ""Best laid plans"" and so forth. Over the past few years I've developed a considerable interest in medicine and, having bounced around from career to career since graduation as so many arts majors do, I'm excited about the prospect of going back to school and learning something with appreciable value.

I guess my biggest question would be - anybody else have a similar experience? How'd it work for you?

My plan as currently constructed is to try and find a decent school who'll take me aboard for a year or so of hardcore math and science classes so that I can take my MCAT and apply to med school relatively soon. Is this plan sound, or are there pitfalls I haven't considered? What's the best major to shoot for? If I can ace an MCAT (not assuming I could, but as a hypothetical), would any halfway-decent schools be willing to accept me with my BA in performing arts, saving me a year or so of prep?

Other details: I'm in the US, willing to travel within the states for school.

Thanks in advance for any and all advice. I'll be checking this semi-regularly, so if there are any details I've failed to provide or any questions you've got for me, let me know.",37,10,2011-10-18,PHARMA,0.023582784458994865,0.9307510852813721,0.045666102319955826

medicine,What is your opinion on foreign medical schools? (outside of North America),"Hey there! I just found this reddit the other day and I figured my question would be appropriate to ask here. When I say foreign, I mean not in North America simply because that's where I come from and I plan to return there after my studies.

I'm relatively new to the medicine scene I guess if you want to say that. I'm 18 and I only decided a year ago that I want to become a doctor, the summer before grade 12. I lived in Canada all my life.

As soon as I figured out what I wanted to do with my life, I looked at all the possible routes I could take. Eventually through research I discovered this program in Krakow, Poland:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_University_Medical_College
(scroll down to the ""Faculty of Medicine"" section)

6 years. Straight out of high school. MD. Awesome! I sent in all the documents and I passed the entrance exam! So now I'm here, studying. It's difficult, but the material is mostly stuff I'm interested in so I'm very happy with my decision at the moment. I plan to go back to somewhere in the States or Canada for my residency once I'm done, currently thinking about emergency med, internal or psychiatry (I'll see what I end up enjoying! :) )

If you've heard anything about programs like this or you have some thoughts, please share. I want to hear what actual med students and doctors think about programs like this. Does it prepare students well, or is it just too much too soon? Is returning back to North America really difficult at all, or are people just scaring me?

I'm from Argentina. I've been with Abdominal pain for 7 years aprox. I've seen many doctors, I followed many diets, I took many pills and my stomach pain just increases over time.
They ran blood tests (they all seem to be normal), urine tests (normal), x rays(they saw lots of gas, i live with constant flatulences), colonoscopy (normal), endoscopy (chronic gastritis), and i believe some other tests have been performed aswell.

This last month my doctor recommended me to do a full diet of just rice. I've been eating rice / integral rice and it gives me diarrhea aswell.
I've been taking trimebutine and omeprazole for like 3 years aswell, and it doesn't help.

Does anyone have any experience to share? at this point, I live in constant pain and diarrhea and I just don't know what to do.

I become a redditor a few months ago so I'm hoping someone here have additional thoughts or recommendations for me and my doctors

Update: they tested for H. Pylori. I don't have it.
Update 2: The pain is located right in the center of the body, 2 fingers up from the belly button.

medicine,"Wanted: Polymer lab, Rogue colo-rectal surgeon.","UK redditor here. Throw away account. But dead serious. 

I am searching for the following, since modern medicine does not provide a pleasant solution to a painfully unhappy condition that I have developed, in the region where the sun shines out of. 

I am searching for: 

1. A lab that does research in muco-adhesive polymers. I believe there is one in Dublin, but something closer to London would be nice. 

2. A lab that provides the ability to perform a few colo-rectal experiments on animal cadavers. 

3. A rogue colo-rectal surgeon in the UK who would be willing to implant this invention into the said region, which should theoretically solve the said condition. (Surgeons have claimed they are not allowed to try my ambitious ass healing technique without a formal 5 year trial and clearances. Existing techniques are, in my humble opinion, less than optimal solutions.)

Health,Difficulties Eating in Public,"I'm thinking it's some form of social anxiety, as opposed to a physical/mechanical issue, but over the past 2 years or so I've struggled with this.  What's distressing, aside from the issue itself, is that I'm in my early 30's (and otherwise healthy) and this feels like it's developed (and grabbed hold of my life) out of thin air!

I can eat/drink/swallow just fine when I'm alone, or at a table by myself, but as soon as I'm sitting around others I get this horrible sensation that my tongue/throat no longer swallows correctly.  My eating speed slows down, I take smaller and smaller bites, and try to wash things down with liquids.  I literally feel and think that I'm about to choke.  Needless to say, my stress and anxiety levels then go through the roof, frequently bringing me to the edge of a full-on panic attack.

At times I feign ""an upset stomach"" just to avoid the physical act of eating in front of family, friends and coworkers.  I've survived 31 years swallowing my food just fine - what the hell is up now!?

Has anyone out there experienced this before or is currently living with something similar to this?  I'd love to hear how you conquered this condition and/or are coping with it.

Health,I need to expose myself to cytomegalovirus.,"To further elaborate, I'm 26 and I have just been listed for heart transplant. As part of assessment one is tested for many antibodies, one of which I do not have is CMV. 

If the donor has CMV and I get it while immunosuppressed it is far more dangerous than if I got it now. In talking to the transplant coordinator I asked if it is so dangerous why not expose me - she said it would be a good idea but it isn't just laying around... I questioned why it wasn't laying around - surely we have stores of many viruses in labs...

So two questions - perhaps one is less ethical than the other:

*Do we have CMV 'laying' around where I could get hold of it?

*Is there an easy way of knowing if one has CMV in order for me to contract it directly from them? (best case scenario swapping spit with some random stanger - or going to a carnival and opening up a kissing stall)

Health,I've had two strange events where my body reacts abnormally to injuries. I'm kinda concerned.,"The first event was maybe 4 or 5 months ago, while I was at work. I cut my thumb with a utility blade and this is the best description I could muster afterward.
""Just cut my thumb pretty good at work. Got a good look at it before I wrapped it in bandaids. I think I went into some sort of shock. I got really dizzy, my hearing got really weird, my ears and face tingled and my sight got crazy with vibrant colors and lights. I apparently went really white in the face as well. I also struggled to apply the second and third bandage because of how dizzy I was. The edges of things were blending together and colors and lights were much more vivid. My brain was having a wicked reaction, it seems, with both my hearing, sight and feeling of my face and ears reacting. I've felt dizzy before from hurting myself, but this was something much more intense. The experience was very trippy, like I was on some drug and I was having a bad trip.""

And then, barely a week ago:
""I was taking my first step down the stairs, and my super soft sock slipped off the smooth hardwood stair. I fell backward, and landed on my back, forearms and legs.
It was a pretty hard landing. It hurt a pretty good deal. But I immediately pulled myself up(out of embarrassment, cause that shit is kinda humiliating) and continued down the stairs while gauging the increasing pain in my left forearm. I start to worry I broke it. I, suddenly fatigued with pain, close the front door and shamble into the kitchen. My face is tingling now and my head has a lot of pressure in it. I lean on the kitchen island to help bear the pain and peculiar sensations in my head.
...
Black. Noises. Like collisions. The vague sound and feeling of falling into things(trash can, door, floor). Voices. Talking(Mother's boyfriend? Finding and asking me if I was ok?). Colors, mostly dark reds, purples and maybe some grays. Feeling of normality. Comfortable.
Sight! It's him! From a strange angle. From below. I'm on the floor. He's asking me if I need help up. I take his extended hand and he helps me get up. I don't remember what I said, but I certainly was talking and conscious. My face feels hot, or cold, or both, and body feels wrecked. Arm hurts. Dizzy still. Waves of varying extremes in temperature washing over my face. He tells me how he heard something and came looking. Found me on the floor, face up, with my arms crossed and my head held up, eyes open(even though I saw nothing until He was directly in front of me, after I don't know how long). I talk to my mom after she checks to see if my pupils are dilating alright. Not concussed, apparently. Hopefully. Continue to shake as if cold for a good 20-30 minutes after.""

The feelings in my face and head were identical in both events. I don't think I was so light headed this last time, though. Just a lot of pain dizziness and then I lost consciousness. It was quick. I've lost consciousness from smacking my head on ice when I was a kid, and I could see my sight go black, and suddenly I was awake again, but this was completely different. I don't remember losing consciousness, and I remember the noises and sensations described and it was as if I were dreaming. Nothing seemed wrong. And my sight returned quit quickly as well. And I didn't notice that I had lost my glasses during the fall. I hadn't noticed my sight was blurry, or I at least don't remember it beings so, until about 25 minutes later.

Is anybody here familiar with anything like this. These two events are extremely new to me, and I've gotten hurt a lot in my life in the past.

And if it matters, I'm O Negative and suffered a blood disorder, [ITP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_thrombocytopenic_purpura), when I was in my junior year of highschool.

Health,Are there any over-the-counter anti-anxiety medications?,"About a year ago I started taking Zoloft for OCD and anxiety, as well as the depression that was brought about by them and other things that have happened in my life. Most of my OCD and anxieties (and depression) went away, except the medicine actually brought a new anxiety (that's what I'm assuming - I didn't have this particular anxiety until I started taking the medicine) that I still have. I've been off the Zoloft for a couple months now, and the anxiety it brought hasn't gone away. My outlook on life has been slowly (very slowly) decreasing recently it seems, though it's mostly on and off (I have okay days and then I have bad days).

Anyways, I think the few anxieties I do still have are causing my mild depression. I'd rather not get anymore expensive prescription meds from my psychiatrist (his office is far away and I can only see him once a month or so). I'd like something cheaper that I can just buy from the store, Walgreens, etc. and administer by myself. Few side-effects are obviously preferred.

Health,"Doctors of Reddit: My gf is very sick, and no doctor can explain why. Please help!","**UPDATE:**


GF is home from the hospital, still lethargic and having intermittent angina and frequent coughing. They changed her medication to the following: Isosorbide Dinitrate (60 mg three times daily), Amlodipine (2.5 mg daily), Aspirin (81 mg daily), Effient (10 mg daily), Verapimil (80 mg three times daily), Pantaprazole (40 mg daily), Lipitor (20 mg daily-- should she even be taking this? Her cholesterol is perfect), sublingual Nitrostat (as needed), and Advair (500 mg, twice daily). Basically, they took her off Prednisone and Plavix, and put her on a new blood thinner, Effient. 


She has an appointment scheduled on Wednesday for a different cardiologist in San Francisco. I'm going to mention both Kounis Syndrome and Churg Strauss. I'm also going to ask that he test her blood for c-ANCA and p-ANCA, which might help in determining whether or not she has Churg Strauss. I'm going to ask about a higher dose of Prednisone (at least 60 mg). If we continue to experience problems with the new cardiologist, I'm going to call Kaiser and ask for a referral to a doctor at UCSF because of her unique (and potentially life-threatening) case. 


Thank you all so much to everyone that responded! Any input is helpful. I'm positive that someone, somewhere, will have the last piece to this diagnostic puzzle and she'll finally be on track towards recovery. I won't stop searching. I will definitely post updates as I get more information. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

My gf asked her cardiologist if she would be able to apply for a temporary handicapped placard for her car, so she doesn't have to walk too far (since she often gets out of breath). Today in the mail, we received a letter from her cardiologist stating what her health problems are, as well as a DMV application for the placard (a very kind gesture that I appreciate!). Here is his ""Patient Active Problem"" List:

* Degenerative Disc Disease, Lower Back *(But her primary care physician said arthritis? Are these the same things?)*
* Asthma
* Case/care mgmt, Asthma, Level 2
* Hx of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
* GERD
* Angina, Prinzmetal
* MI, &lt; 8 weeks *(it's actually well beyond 8 weeks, but okay...)*
* Eosinophilia
* Leukocytosis
* **Acute coronary syndrome** *(first time I've heard of this!)*
* MI, acute, **non ST segment elevation**
* CAD *(I assume this stands for coronary artery disease... is this the same as atherosclerosis? We were told that she* didn't *have atherosclerosis)*

I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I thought I would include it anyway. 

**ORIGINAL POST:**


I’ll start from the beginning. About two years ago she was diagnosed with asthma. She started taking Monelukast (Singular) supplemented with Advair twice a day, and nebulized Albuterol as needed. About one year ago, she started to have, what she described at the time, as “heart burn.” Doctors told her she had gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and recommended she take OTC antiacids like Tums, Prilosec, etc., none of which helped much, despite avoiding acidic food. Months of persistent chest/stomach pain finally led to some lab tests. It was discovered that she had a *H. Pylori* bacteria infection and gastritis. She was given antibiotics, I think Cipro. 


Then, suddenly this March, she had a heart attack. We were sitting on the couch at our friend’s house watching Netflix, and she complained for hours about a foreign-body sensation in her throat. She started coughing a lot and having asthma problems. We decided to go to the hospital for her asthma; it was then that she passed out in the admitting area. She had an angiogram and angioplasty. She was diagnosed with the following: retroperitoneal hematoma, GERD, prinzmetal’s angina, and hx of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [severe lesion proximal RCA—4.0 x 32 mm Taxus drug eluting stent expanded to 4.0 mm, spasm initially seen in LAD—not present at final angiogram, moderate inferobasilar wall motion abnormality with EF of approx 50%, angioseal deployed (6 Fr)]. She stayed in the hospital for a few days. She was put on the following medications: Asprin, Clopidogrel, Diltiazem, Famotidine, Simvastatin, and sublingual Nitroglycerin as needed. 


Since then, she has been hospitalized over twenty times with recurrent chest pain (luckily we have insurance), each time with elevated Troponin levels and eosinophilia. Nitroglycerin helps a bit, but not much (she usually has to take it 6-7 times a day). She has had her medicine changed back and forth each time. She’s been on several different forms of Isosorbide. Doctors say that her heart itself doesn’t seem to be a problem; the problem is that her coronary arteries are spasming and restricting oxygen to her heart. At one point it was suspected that she had vasculitis (Churg-Strauss Syndrome), but since she can’t have a biopsy (she's on blood thinners), they couldn’t make a conclusive diagnosis. They put her on Prednisone anyway, which seemed to help for awhile, then stopped working. She has seen multiple cardiologists, rheumatologists, and other specialists, none of which understand what’s going on. She has had five angiograms. On some of the angiograms you can’t even see her arteries, they’re so constricted. I have a couple pictures of her angiograms that I can scan tomorrow if it’s helpful.


We are running out of options and time. She has become lethargic, her quality of life has severely deteriorated, and it’s killing me to see her covered in brusies from being on Plavix, crying in her hospital bed because the pain is unbearable. I just want her to be the happy, healthy person she used to be… She’s in the hospital now once again and doctors are now thinking about retracting their initial diagnosis of prinzmetal’s angina because of her age. I’m lying in bed, home from work, feeling hopeless. I don't have any medical training, but I've been searching through a lot of medical journals the past few months, hoping to find something relevant or overlooked. I haven't yet. I really don’t know what to do anymore other than sit here and write this as I cry. 


Doctor’s of Reddit, what can we do? What do you think? We live in the SF Bay and have Kaiser Insurance. Is anyone interested in delving deeper into her case? 



**Other facts that might be useful:**

* 28 year old southeast Asian female
* History of smoking from age 17 to age 27 (quit before heart attack)
* Experiences angina every day, but angina increases during menstrual period. Also, her heart attack occurred while she was on her period. I asked if she could be put on the birth control pill to increase her estrogen levels, but her doctors said that would do more harm than good. 
* Stress test has always been normal. Angina occurs mostly at rest, but can also during activity. 
* Current medications: Verpamil, Simvastatin, Isosorbide Dinitrate, Prednisone 10 mg, Aspirin 325 mg, Nitrostat (as needed), Proair as needed) , Advair 500 mg, Plavix. 
* Discontinued medications: Metroprolol, Singulair, Amlodipine, Famotidine, Pantoprazole, Diltiazem, probably some others that I’m forgetting. 
* Persistent cough that doesn’t respond well to asthma medication
* No skin problems observed
* No Raynaud’s Phenomenon
* No Barrett’s esophagus
* Kidneys and liver normal
* Most recent (as of yesterday) eosinophil count: 25%
* Lipid panel is normal
* ALT, AST, alkaline phosphate is normal
* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is normal


**TL;DR: MI in March with stent placed in RAC, GERD, eosinophilia, dyspnea, asthma, unstable angina caused by arterial vasospasms, 5 angiograms, normal stress test. Getting progressively worse and not responding to well to medication. Please help.**",151,212,2011-10-28,PHARMA,0.09482375284036,0.8686104615529379,0.03656581913431486

medicine,LCME probation,"So, the LCME recently requested that my school be put on probation. We will not know if the school will be put on probation for several months. If the probation is enacted, it will be two years before the LCME decides if the accreditation will be reinstalled or revoked. The issues listed by the LCME are related to administration problems and my school, thus far, has responded by making some changes in the faculty. 

My question is should I be considering transferring schools at this point? I am a first year student and I really like my school (My fellow classmates are awesome, and I am close to family/friends). If I should be considering transferring when should I be attempting this process and how likely is it that I would be able to transfer given the circumstances?  

Thus far I have heard that the odds of LCME revoking accreditation are slim (my school is in the US), but because the negative outcome is overwhelmingly terrible (not being able to participate in match) I am not sure how I should be approaching this situation.

If accreditation were revoked in my third year, would there be any protocols in place to guarantee transfer for the affected students? 

Any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks",6,5,2011-10-28,PHARMA,0.01879185065627098,0.741204559803009,0.2400035411119461
