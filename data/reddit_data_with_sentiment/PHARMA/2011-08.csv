Health,About Booze...,"I'm a pretty regular drinker. If there were no other factors involved I would probably have 4-5 drinks on an average day.

Being a fairly health conscious person I do not do this. In fact, over the past year or so I have been keeping strict track of how many drinks I have each week. 

Recently I've decided to be more disciplined about it and have been doing some research. However the more I read the more confused I get. 

I thought counting one 12oz beer or one 8oz glass of wine as a ""drink"", and having no more than 20 a week (on average a little less than three a day) was about right. But now it seems that this is not a good guideline at all. It turns out that what counts as a ""drink"" varies from country to country - and that researchers count [units of alcohol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_alcohol) instead of ""drinks"", and even this varies from country to country!       

The [recommended maximum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommended_maximum_intake_of_alcoholic_beverages) is all a big international mess as well. Surely the factors involved are not zip-code dependent. 

Anyone have some good, concise, *consistent*, research-backed guidelines? How do others regulate their alcohol intake?",67,52,2011-08-02,PHARMA,0.042558569461107254,0.925632894039154,0.031808529049158096

2 years ago I got a something like a gastric bypass surgery where you get your stomach made super tiny but doesn't get jumped halfway down the intestinal tract like that surgery so its technically not as drastic. It makes you eat virtually nothing but its super easy to keep to. Its been the best decision of my life letting me lose all this weight, holy crap its amazing! I went from 320 lbs to the 175 I am at now. I see big people all the time and want to share my story and have more people informed and go for this treatment if appropriate. 

And for all the fat people hate that I know this is gonna get... get bent. I was playing sports every season in high school and always working out only to lose like 40 pounds and put it back on during any break from it. This stuff is genetic; with everyone in my family and extended family overweight or killing themselves to stay normal sized its plain as day to see I was fighting a huge uphill battle.

I spoke with a 500 lbs guy earlier this week and shared my story and he seemed happy to know about this as an option and after showing my close friends some older pictures I figured I'd share my success here on reddit",4,4,2011-08-03,PHARMA,0.027062850072979927,0.9258310794830322,0.04710610955953598

Health,Persistent headaches and lightheadedness. Doesn't feel 'real'. What's going on?,"Hello, this is my first post on /r/Health, but I've seen helpfulness and courtesy from the people here; I've had this problem for approximately 7 months now, and it's progressively getting worse. I'm extremely nervous and confused about what's happening.

I've been a healthy male my whole life. I'm currently 19 years old and not on any medication. I take daily vitamins and fish oil. I exercise fairly regularly; I have been playing soccer for 15 years, and sportfighting for two. I've had my share of cuts, bruises, broken bones, and sicknesses (both small and severe), but I've never experienced what I'm experiencing now. Early of last year (2010), my friend introduced me to marijuana. I tried it, everything seemed fine, so I continued. At first, it was once a month. Then, it was once every two weeks. Then, it was once a week. It didn't get much more than that, but I could still stop for a few days and everything would be normal. There were even multiple times I would stop for weeks at a time, and life still went on completely as usual.

This spanned until mid-January. I was having surgery to have my wisdom teeth removed. After the surgery was successful, they sent me home with a percoset prescription. My mom only allowed me half of a tablet whenever I complained, which was about every other day for a little over a week, so I didn't really have much. I did a little research on mixing marijuana and percoset, to be sure there wouldn't be any negative effects, but decided I would refrain from smoking just to be on the safe side.

A few days after taking my last percoset, I tried smoking. It was late at night in late January; under my heated blanket, on my tempurpedic bed, watching television. A very comfortable environment. Suddenly, the sharpest pain I had ever felt strikes my heart; I clutch it. It's constant. Two hours pass; I'm still in intense pain, my 'high' is long gone. I was calm, breathing slowly and deeply, but my heart was still racing.

I haven't been the same since that night. At first, It was heart-related issues. My heart would have these sharp, constant pains at random times. Sometimes within minutes of each other, sometimes not for a month. It was strange; and the two doctors I went to did three or four tests and said it was panic attacks.

I tried smoking once since that night (5 months ago); and the same thing happened. The heart 'episodes' haven't happened for about two months. Now, I have a much more strange and scary issue. Over the past few months, I've noticed myself getting more and more light-headed. It doesn't feel like life is real anymore; it feels like I'm dreaming, and it doesn't go away. I wake up with it, and I lie down at night with it. I've also been having headaches like this. They've been getting worse as well. They may or may not be related, but I wake up with them, fall asleep with them. I've noticed a lack of ability to focus recently. My eyes don't seem to adjust to depth or textures as well as they used to. It takes squinting and head repositioning to adjust to a new visual range. Just yesterday, I was in a restaurant where the seats were a floral pattern. Every time I looked, it was like a 90's 3D movie. It hurt to look at. Made my head (just behind my eyes) ache.

I'm not sure if it's a problem with my eyes, head, or something else, but does anyone know what's going on or how to stop it? I haven't felt truly great in so long. The few medically-inclined people I've told suggested that stress was to blame. Yet, if it wasn't for this, my life would be everything I want it to be. I landed a great internship with an awesome group of co-workers, I'm in a happy relationship of nearly a year, finally paying my parents the debt I owe them for repairing my car last summer. Things are going great, but I can't appreciate it because it doesn't feel real. Nothing does. To make the situation more scary and frustrating, the two doctors I've been to about this have told me it's all in my head. It's honestly getting a little aggravating that they give up so easily. I have posted this passage on WebMD as well, but have yet to get a response after a little over a week.

Feel free to ask any questions, and I want to thank you all for taking the time to read this, whether you can help you or not. I'm truly scared of what's happening. Thanks /r/health",13,7,2011-08-05,PHARMA,0.1793328821659088,0.7882217764854431,0.03244529664516449
Health,I'm feeling tired and it's ruining my life,"Hello, /r/health, 
Been feeling tired for years and nothing I do ever seems to help, I just, can't take it anymore! It's ruining my life!

My symptoms: 

-Tired, all the time, regardless of how much I sleep. (I try to maintain a healthy sleeping pattern so I go to sleep every day around the same hour and sleep around 7:30-8 hours)

-Unable to focus, most days I just can't do it, no matter how hard I try, my mind floats somewhere else or just doesn't pay enough attention. 

-Forgetful, I forget, a lot. This mostly happens with names of people I just met, I usually forget someone's name about 5 times in the same day before I start remembering it. I also can't seem to be able to memorize details in general.

-Slightly depressed, this is only due to how I feel on a daily basis, because it limits my capacity to do certain things that I enjoy so I end up feeling hopeless and downright sad! 

-Can't seem to be able to form up coherent sentences, both in writing and in conversations, though it's much more prevalent in writing.

-Social anxiety, I'm terrified of social situations, mostly because I know that whatever I say, in the end I'll sound like an idiot. I'm not even being pessimistic about it. I have days (quite rare) when I do not experience any of the above symptoms and I can function extremely well and be rather charismatic.

Symptoms I don't have:
-My muscles do not feel tired and I can exercise just fine whenever I choose to do so. (I am a runner and I do it 3 times a week without any problems)

-I am not overweight. I've lost 22 pounds in the last 6 months (after exercising and eating less/better food)

The reason I'm asking you guys for help is because I've already spoken to my doctor and he recommended I do an MRI. Now, being an unemployed student with no health insurance in a third world country isn't helping me at all and I would rather find out all I can about what possible conditions I could have before I go rushing to spend money I don't even have on tests that probably aren't relevant.

I decided not to bore you with my hopes and dreams and how I can't accomplish them because of how I feel. I just know that I can't go on living like this. So please /r/health, help me out over here.",18,6,2011-08-05,PHARMA,0.18735164403915405,0.7839416861534119,0.028706667944788933

Health,Is it normal to have headaches after getting permanent teeth removed?,"I'm 16 and in order for my braces to straighten my teeth I had to remove two of my premolars (the other two in a week and a half). 

With the anesthetic I didn't feel a thing obviously but shortly after my mouth starting hurting like a bastard. I took some Panadol to help but once it started to wear off a few hours later it came back along with extremely painful headaches. I couldn't sleep until 6AM because of them and everytime I take something it just comes back a few hours later.

Are these headaches common when teeth are removed or could it be something more serious (a revealed health issue)? I know of headaches caused by pain pills but just want to know if this is common.

If it helps the location of my headaches are....well.....all over the place. Right now the top-right of the back of my head is feeling a tiny amount but last night it was the complete right side of my head (including my cheek)",9,4,2011-08-06,PHARMA,0.485207736492157,0.4828977584838867,0.03189455717802048

Health,"Doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists - may I ask you something?","I've asked this before of individuals in your field, and always received a rather unsatisfactory answer.  By that, I mean the question was rather evaded or glossed over without being clearly addressed.  Since I've just had cause for it to come up yet again, I wondered if anyone here could venture an answer for me.

For the past couple of years I've been chatting with a lot of people who are depressed and suicidal.  Many, *many* of them avoid or resist professional treatment, and the reason is always the same - fear of being exposed to family/friends/employer, and the fear of being involuntarily hospitalised or locked up.  Therefore, it is extremely common, if they do seek professional help, whether it be for medication or therapy of some kind, to down play or often outright lie when asked ""those"" questions.  The ones that are supposed to trigger your legal obligations and cause you to take action for their (and other people's) safety.  

So, my question is:  Do you really believe them?  If you ask someone ""are you having suicidal thoughts?"" or ""have you ever planned or thought about ways to kill yourself?"" and they say ""no"", what do you think?  The cynical me suspects that so long as the right answers are provided, the professional is able to ignore whether it is the truth or not, in terms of covering their own arse in the event of something going wrong.  Please tell me it isn't always like that, but do tell me whether you realise *how routinely people actually do lie when asked those important questions*.  And how do *you* handle it?  Thanks for taking the time to consider this.  I'm hoping it might help in my dealings with people in these situations.  The anti-medical stance is very strongly embedded in many minds.",9,7,2011-08-07,PHARMA,0.10994738340377808,0.865349292755127,0.024703292176127434

Health,"/r/Health, Does walking barefoot increase your chances of catching a cold? Thank you.","So, a little bit of context here. I have done a bit of research into the matter and all my sources seem to indicate NO. Also, from my Med school education, although I'm only entering 3rd grade now, I know enough to say that walking barefoot or not is not a factor in catching a virus or bacteria.

The Core body temperature is, however, apparently, a semi important factor, but my understanding is that when exposed to cold, the superficial veins in the apical extremities contract. This forces blood through the deeper vein system that flows next to the arteries, which establishes a countercurrent multiplaction system that permits heat to transfer from the arteries to the veins. Thus, the deoxygenated blood that returns to the non apical parts of the body is warm, maintaining core body temperature. 

So, you guys are asking, Why the hell is he asking if he knows the answer? Is he karma whoring or trying to impress a couple of redditers? No. The answer is: **Ze Terrible Monstrouos MOTHER.**

Yes, you heard me right. Everytime I'm at my parents house we have huge fights about this. She just rejects all the evidence and explanations I give her. I've showed her various studies such as [this one](http://www.drmirkin.com/morehealth/9941.html), but she dismisses them saying they're only ""Opinions"" and they were ""Pfft, done in the 50's and 60's).

I need serious help. I'm very close to just wranngling her neck like a rabbit. It doesn't help that I'm in pre exam period and studying makes me edgy, so, Reddit, please, if you have ANY tips on how to convince her, or links to more recent studies, I'd appreciate the help :).

Health,The doctor says I should have my gallbladder removed? Your thoughts/own experiences?,"I have gone to the ER several times the last few years complaining of stomach/back/side pain, bloating, gas, the feeling that I have diarrhea, etc. They've tried giving me antacids like prilosec and nexium but they haven't helped.

The last time I went to the ER my doctor seemed convinced that I should get my gallbladder removed even though they only found one small stone and my HIDA scan was perfectly normal. Not to mention I don't feel nauseous, am not yellow in color, I don't feel the pain in my upper-right side below the ribs, etc. However, I do sometimes get lower and upper back pain, lower right side pain, chest pain, and also symptoms of indigestion (some websites state that gallbladder issues do NOT cause indigestion or stomach problems, while some websites do, so I'm confused on this.) In taking x-rays, blood tests, ultra-sound, Cat Scan, etc., the doctors didn't find anything else abnormal, but nothing like an endoscopy was performed since that's an invasive procedure.

I also saw a GI doctor but they refused to take my concerns about digestive issues seriously because they said I should do what my doctor says: get my gallbladder removed. The thing is, although for the most part the medical consensus is that the gallbladder is unnecessary, 1) I've heard it can make your digestive issues worse, and 2) Removing an organ isn't exactly reversible. 

My question is, am I over-worrying about this and being stupid about it? I am just scared that I will have my gallbladder removed and then my problems will either worsen or simply still not be fixed.",33,5,2011-08-07,PHARMA,0.24405765533447266,0.7303305268287659,0.02561180293560028

Health,Doctors of Reddit:  Can you please put my mind at ease and help diagnose this infection?,"Edit: Just got a second opinion and was told it's shingles.  I'll be seeing a dermatologist tomorrow to confirm.

Post may be very graphic.  Weak stomached redditors beware.

A week ago I woke up with a lot of tenderness in my neck and my lymph node was swollen.  I noticed a bunch of large bumps in my scalp and behind my ear, which I assumed were bug bites.  Over the next few days, more bumps popped up and the ones behind my ear started developing pus on top of them.

I saw a doctor and they weren't completely sure what it was.  They ruled out herpes and said it could be lyme disease.  So I did some research and none of the lyme disease cases I saw online look anything like what I have.  I'm on doxycycline mono just in case it is lyme and I'm getting blood work done to check for lyme antibodies.

Aside from the inflammation and redness, there's no constant ache save for some painful throbbing every 15-20 seconds. 

Just to get a second opinion, could you guys take a look at these pictures and let me know if you agree with the diagnosis or if you have other thoughts on what it could be?

Health,I got laid off and lost my health insurance which paid for my CPAP machine. My new job offers health insurance but I have to wait 12 months for them to start paying for my CPAP again. I hate this.,"I'm American and I have sleep apnea and have been using a CPAP machine for about a year or so and it's been AWESOME. I honestly don't remember how I survived without it.

I recently got laid off and after 2 months or so found a new job that offered the same insurance provider (BCBS). I happily applied only to find out my machine won't be paid for until after a 12 month waiting period due to the pre-existing condition.

It's about $200 a month and while that seems small to some, I do not make enough with the new job to pay for it out of pocket. I'm thinking of getting a credit card to put it on but I am wondering if anyone out there has had any similar experiences with this and maybe a suggestion on how to work it out.

I'm pretty desperate as I don't want to be without it and I will pay for it using credit if I have to. Anyone else who has sleep apnea can probably relate.

**TL;DR- I lost my health insurance which quit paying for my CPAP and now have to wait 12 months for my new health insurance to kick in and pay for it. Now wanting any advice Reddit can offer**

Thanks guys

Health,My eye has not stopped twitching for 3 weeks.  Please god help me.,"I think it might be 1 of 2 things.  Stress or allergies.  My job is very stressful, which accounts for my time at work.  The odd thing is it keeps going even when I'm home doing things to de-stress.  I've been covering all the de-stressing bases; having regular and good sex, eating well, having fun playing with my daughter, having a stiff drink when she goes to bed, I even got to smoke a blunt with an old friend last weekend when my wife and daughter were away.  The twitch (upper and lower lids) persists almost nonstop.  I also have seasonal allergies, which is what my mom suggested, and may be a possibility.  However they have never caused this before.

Health,I freak out when I'm touched.,"I've never been big on being touched. I usually avoided it when little, but I'd be accepting of holding hands and skipping, or hugging my friends. The first time I ever really freaked was when I had a dystonic reaction to some cough medicine.  Someone went to pat my shoulder from behind to comfort me and I ended up screaming and curling into a ball.

With stress it seems to get worse and it's to the point now that if I get bumped in a crowd I feel like crying.

My girlfriend moved in recently so there's been a lot of wants and cuddles but I just can't stand it, especially when it comes at a surprise. It feels like I'm in a sudden sensory overload with just a light caress and I genuinely freak out anywhere between a couple seconds to a few minutes. I feel like I'm hurting her feelings but I can't control it.

And it's not as though I don't want to be touched, and I can't seem to figure out why this is happening. ): I just want to hold hands without randomly curling into a fetal position.

So I'm taking my mcat next friday, and I just took a practice and got a 21. I've been scoring in the high 20's and it's been rising since last week. And this is a major let down. Last week i got a 28 and was still going strong. 

I've been studying since late June, and this is just terribly disheartening. Any words of encouragement is great. I think I need an extra push for the last mile left. 

After I finished the full length, I couldn't think of anything but to just go over the exam and know what I did wrong. It appeared that I was just not in the right state of mind. I'm now scared that I'm not going to hit the 30 mark anymore. 

Help redditors! Being a doctor has been my dream since I was a kid.

**Just wanted to thank everyone for the constant encouragement. I sincerely appreciate it. I did better today. Finally scored the big 10 on Physical Sciences (which is my weakness) on aamc 9. I'm going to keep trying to get there. I know I have less than a week, but I'll hopefully peak at the test. Hopefully, this thread will also help others who are taking it soon.

pharmacy,"I'm an indecisive, hesitant high school senior; Pre-pharm major or something else?","I'm a senior in high school this year and I've had ideas about becoming a pharmacist and have been researching it since junior year. I can see myself working in a pharmacy (or a hospital, even) in the future; I have strong communication skills, I am organized and detailed, and I also would like to be associated in the medical field with my job and get those salary benefits as well.

What is steering me away from the pre-pharmacy major (and eventual 4 years of pharmacy school) are the intricate, intense science classes I'll be taking in college. Courses like microbiology, chemistry, physics, and anatomy keep appearing in the pre-professional coursework of several schools I want to apply to.

I've taken general chemistry and biology courses during my high school years, but I've never taken physics or anatomy courses. Biology wasn't HORRIBLY difficult - I ended up passing with an A - and chemistry isn't too bad now. I find all concepts of science to be interesting, but there are some things I have struggles with. I guess what is intimidating me is the elaboration and extension of the concepts in the fast-passed, stressful college environment.

I've heard from several people that if I'm not a DIE-HARD, passionate lover of science, I'll have issues with the 2 years of prerequisite coursework.

If anyone can provide experience or advice, that'd be great. Thank you all for your help and support.",15,5,2011-08-27,PHARMA,0.032800428569316864,0.9287935495376587,0.038406018167734146

Health,Just diagnosed with OCD. Where do I go from here?,"Hi, Reddit. I'm a 19 year old male currently attending college in the U.S. and I've recently been diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.

For years (since I was about 12 or 13) I've struggled with strangely specific fears and obsessions. For a year between 8th grade and my freshman year of High School I was terrified of being possessed by a demon even though I've never been religious or believed in such things. I never heard voices or hallucinated, mind you, but the simple thought of being possessed terrified me and I would obsess about it constantly, causing me to lose sleep and isolate myself from others. 

Later on, when beginning High School, I got over this initial obsession and moved on to another. I would stay at home instead of hanging out with my friends because I was scared to go to parties for fear of being arrested or getting into trouble. This cause me to develop slight depression simply as a result of my constant isolation. Being around weed in particular would make me feel especially anxious. I have nothing at all against drinking or smoking weed but the mere chance of me being arrested made me feel ill and compelled me to stay at home. Police to this day invoke anxiety on sight.

Most recently, my thoughts or obsessions turned to more sexual things. I was terrified that in some way I was going to impregnate my younger sister. One day I had masturbated in the bathroom and forgot to wipe some excess on the seat (not a substantial amount if I remember correctly) and my younger sister used the bathroom before I was able to run back and clean up. I spent the day an utter anxious wreck, sick to my stomach and on the verge of hyperventilation. It was a few days before I could begin to function normally again and the thoughts of me somehow ""infecting"" my sister plagued my mind in the months to come. This episode lead to related, but more irrational, obsessions. If I had masturbated or had sex earlier in the day and not showered and then used the toilet, I had to ""sanitize"" the seat to make sure none of my guys were still there. It was at this time that I began to think I was beginning to lose my mind.

After hearing about false memory syndrome and repressed memories in a course at my university I begun to obsess about the notion that I had either abused my sister in the past and repressed the memory or was abused by one of my parents in the past and repressed my own memories of it. Of course I knew both of these notions to be completely false and irrational but the mere thought of it, again, caused me great anxiety and made me feel sick to my stomach. These thoughts have caused me to distance myself from my younger siblings which sucks because they deserve to have a supportive older brother who's there for them. It's also made me extremely cautious about being around other children as it's another intrusive thought of mine to be thought of as a pedophile (even though, of course, I would never think of a child that way or ever dream of hurting a child).

These thoughts made me feel like a freak, a bad person, worthless and beyond help. It was recently that my amazing girlfriend and my equally amazing mom encouraged me to seek help. I've met with a Psychiatrist and a Psychologist at my school's mental health center and have been formally diagnosed with OCD. I never thought that I would have OCD (I thought it was only people who compulsively wash their hands, perform odd rituals, etc.) but the more I read about it, particularly about sexual obsessions, the more it seems to fit me. The Psychiatrist has offered to prescribe me meds (SSRI's) but I wanted to try just therapy first. I start regular therapy in two weeks.

I guess I wrote the post, partially as a therapeutic mechanism and partly to seek advice from others who have suffered from this disorder or known people who have. It it unwise to turn away from meds (the thought of taking them makes me anxious)? 

I can clarify some of my obsessions if you'd like or elaborate on others I haven't listed here (I didn't want to ramble). I can also answer any questions you guys might have. I don't even know if anyone will read this post or care but it feels good to write it all out.
