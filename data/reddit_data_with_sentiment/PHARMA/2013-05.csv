I've been this way for a long time, and I hate it, it's as if I look dopey, and I often feel tired, sluggish etc, and I have no idea what it is. I have a friends who sometimes joke about me looking high, and I've even had people actually ask me if im high/tired, and I've never done drugs in my entire life. It makes me extremely self conscious and lowers my mood and sometimes even makes me feel depressed.

I can widen my eyes to talk to people and I rarely get this response, but I don't feel relaxed about it, I guess it's just my normal expression when I'm not focused on anything.

Sometimes I do feel energetic, and it's usually later in the day, but what I'm feeling right now is literally shit, and I thought I might be able to get some help on here.

I want to know if I'm missing something, I want to feel and look more energized, can anyone give me some sort of advice to help me? Both long term and short term...

medicine,"Always, always, always have a chaperone","I just wanted to share this story because it teaches a vital lesson that I, and I hope anyone who reads this will keep in the back of their mind throughout their careers. I'm a M3 that just finished my IM clerkship at a county hospital in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country, in one of the brokest states in the union. On one of the first days of the clerkship, we had a 60 year old diverticulitis patient complaining of vaginal pain on the 3rd day of admission. Pelvic exam was planned. Pelvic exams at county are done in a small closet-like room on the ward. Our male second year IMG resident made the grave mistake of performing the exam without a chaperone. I wasn't their to witness any of this, but the story gathered from nurses and residents is that the woman ran out of the room screaming and claiming full penetrative rape. She was escorted to the ED by nurses. Rape kit was performed and was negative. At sign out that evening, the resident was escorted off the premises by police.

County decided w/in a few short days after the incident that it would be economically/politically expedient to settle with this patient out of court, and forced the resident to resign. This is just conjecture but I imagine his not having a chaperone, him being foreign and unfamiliar with the legal system, and the publicity the trial would have generated contributed to their decision. This effectively destroyed his career. He is now tasked with reapplying to residency programs as an IMG with this on his record. Many know how hard it is to land a residency spot as an IMG with an immaculate record. I really feel bad for the guy, and torn up about this whole situation. Moral of the story: Always, Always, ALWAYS have a chaperone, male and female alike.

I have to account for the fact that maybe he was an undercover creeper and didn't get taken advantage of here, but the facts don't add up. You would have to convince me that he was willing to sacrifice his entire career to have sex with a 60 year old diverticulitis patient. The pelvic exam room is in earshot of at least 15 people, there would be no exit strategy on that plan, and you can't convince me that he's stupid. She claimed he pulled out his penis and forcibly penetrated her, the rape kit was negative. He made a mistake, but he didn't deserve to lose his career. He deserved his goddamn day in court. So moral number two: Don't trust your institute to value your career if selling you down the river constitutes the path of least resistance.",92,311,2013-05-05,PHARMA,0.17850905656814575,0.7989639043807983,0.022527044638991356

Health,My 68 year old father just had a benign tumor removed from his brain. Please help.,"So I don't know all of the real technical terms of everything, but a few years ago my father was notified by his doctor that he had a small brain tumor. It was deemed benign early on and he chose to ignore it and not tell the family (he is an extremely stubborn hispanic man haha).

So a few years pass and starting this year he began to get these 'episodes' of slurred speech and putting words together than wouldn't make sense. He also started to experience a feeling on not knowing where he was or who he was talking to. These happened maybe 3-4 times (that we knew of) until one night he was on the phone with my mother (they are divorced but still are best friends) and he began to laugh hysterically and was compiling sentences that made no sense..so long story short I took him to the hospital that same night and they found that his tumor had grown in size and was applying pressure to parts of his brain that controls speech and memory.

Skipping some parts of the story, he had the surgery..seemed to be doing well (despite the insane scar he now has that goes right across his upper forehead). He was released a few days later into my brothers care and soon enough started to 'shit himself' and wiping himself and leaving napkins all over. This was extremely unusual as my father has always been a clean man and showered every day. My brother took him back to the hospital and he was shortly sent to a rehabilitation center.

He stayed at the rehab for a few weeks and was then released to the care of my mother and her husband. (certainly seems weird to most but my mom and dad are best friends and my mothers husband truly understands that my father is in desperate need of love and care, thus making me respect the man on a whole new level) anyhow, the first night we brought him out of the rehab upon walking up the three steps to get into my mothers apartment, my dad fell on the third step and said his knees gave out..he then crawled to the door and was crying b.c of the pain.

A few days later brings me to today. He seems to be doing MUCH better, but still has episodes of anger outbreaks and paranoia. He needs help getting up, and has to be bathed and needs assistance using the bathroom.

He also has always has anxiety, and pretty bad depression, and now it seems his depression and anger outbreaks are more prominent in little outbursts.

When it comes down to it, I just would like to know what things I might expect to happen or signs of something getting worse.

Thanks in advance, and please if you need more information to help me with this, I have no problem answering.

medicine,Surgeons if meddit - any regrets? Is it worth it?,"Hi guys. I'm a final year medical student in Aus and have always wanted to head down the surgical route.

I'm wondering how surgeons feel at the end of their training. Was it worth the long hours and missed lifestyle? Surgery seems to be becoming more and more competitive (increased graduate to training spot ratio) and stories of people plodding along for years and years not getting onto program's scare me. I have no preference really (although I do like ENT, neuro and plastics) but they all have &amp;lt;15 spots australia wide a year with increasing applicants per year. 

To add to this, I've been hearing stories of consultants not even getting full time work post fellowship! There are plenty of generalist jobs available but the specialty market seems to be saturated in many fields so the college is no doubt correct in their restrictions of places (market requirement etc).  Is anyone able to comment?  

I love medicine and research as well and often consider physician training (oncology, cards?) although I would like to be hands on! And I'm sure these are competitive in their own right. 

I know I have a few years to decide yet but the competitiveness means you really have to start research in your field of choice early if you want a chance! I love surgery, the rush is great.

pharmacy,Would like the input of pharmacists that have worked the overnight 7/70 schedule.,"I'm just finishing up my PGY1 and looking am for a hospital position.  I'm limited geographically by a relationship I'm not willing to give up.

I interviewed for a clincal pharmacist position at a wonderful hospital in the metro area a few weeks ago.  Today they called and wondered if I'd consider taking an overnight position.  They have not yet said anything about the original position for which I applied and interviewed.

When it comes down to it I'd rather not work overnights.  But I'd rather work overnights than be unemployed with 117k in student loans.

So, 7/70-ers, what do you see as the pro's and con's of your position?  Are you happy in it?  Obviously I know this is a personal decision, but the overnight pharmacists at my hosiptal rotate 7/70 with 1 week overnight, 1 week off, 1 week days, 1 week off, repeat so they can't really comment on the schedule itself.

Any input you can give would be greatly appreciated!

Edit:  should have clarified, the position is at a different hospital than mine.  Straight overnights :(  I simply met my current colleagues can't provide much perspective as they have a much cushier deal with only one week a month.

**Edit 2:** Thanks for all the input!  You guys have given me some good things to consider.  I just called back and said that I'd be interested in the position and look forward to hearing from them.

Health,"I have had chronic abdominal pain, severe fatigue and pressure headaches for the past 6 months, have seen several specialists, and no one can diagnose me. I will soon lose my job because of it.","Hi everyone. I wasn't sure where else to post this, maybe /r/Fibromyalgia, but this was more broad. 

I am 28, female, relatively healthy, or was before this all started.

To give some background, I have suffered and been treated for severe anxiety and OCD my whole life. In high school, where I was incredibly active, I began to suffer from mysterious bouts of fatigue. I could easily sleep for 8-11 hours and still not be able to move when I awoke. The fatigue always increased with stress.  

In December of 2012 I began to have a menstrual cycle that lasted nearly a month. No spotting, bleeding the whole time. About half-way through this I began to have severe abdominal pain in the lower right quadrant. I'm not talking normal cramping, I mean so bad I could not stand up. I called my gynecologist, who conveniently was about to leave for a cruise. She ordered an ultrasound and looked at the results over her vacation and found nothing. She referred me to another gynecologist who performed surgery, just in case it was eventually necessary. 

Over the next few months I would also see two urologists, a fertility endocrinologist, a gastroenterologist, and a nurse practitioner. I had a CT scan, four ultrasounds, countless x-rays, a HIDA scan, and blood and urine tests out the wazoo. For procedures I have had a laparoscopy, endoscopy, and a cystoscopy. I have been told that I am going through premature ovarian failure, that I have kidney stones, that I don't have kidney stones, that I have kidney stones, and again, finally, that I don't have kidney stones. 

All of the doctors have eventually concluded that they cannot find a source for the pain and that I need to see someone else. The most recent was the endocrinologist that said I need to see a pain specialists, but didn't recommend anyone.  

After the cystoscopy, the pain increased immensely. The urologist said he couldn't find a kidney stone. I was in so much pain that I was kept overnight for observation. A new pain, in addition to the original started after the procedure, higher up in my right side. My side felt like it was going to burst open. The next day I was forced to leave the hospital, even though I could not even go to the bathroom without assistance. The day nurse tried to contact the urologist, but he was out of town and would not respond to her calls. No doctor saw me that day. I told them if they released me that I would end up in the ER, and I did, two days later. Again, it felt like my side had burst open. The ER did all of the tests they could think of and nothing came of it. 

I saw multiple more doctors over the next couple months and still nothing. I am nearly out of FMLA time and my original doctor filled out the paperwork incorrectly. HR did not discover this until two months later, so now I have been scrambling for paperwork that I cannot get signed again. I am very close to losing my job, in constant pain, fatigue, and now depression in fear of losing my job and my health insurance. 

I am suspicious that this could be fibromyalgia. I have had a GP suggest it in the past, but he could not recommend any specialists. Doctors are scarce in my area, and the waiting time is long for specialists. 

I am at a loss at this point. I will be trying to contact a pain specialists on Monday, but it won't matter if no one will sign my FMLA paperwork. I know people that have taken 12 weeks for depression because she went through a bad breakup, but I can get someone to help e because I am in severe, chronic pain. I have lost all faith in doctors who have easily given up after a few tests come up negative. They shrug their shoulders and tell me to find someone else. I even had one say my pain was all in my head, but did not tell me who to see. I will admit it is a possibility that some of the pain is psychogenic, but after much research, my symptoms do not point to that. 

Have any of you been in a similar situation? What did you do?  

**Edit:** a bit more information regarding the pain. It increases when I am on my cycle, like menstrual cramps. This is why I initially saw a gynecologist. It also increases when I have a bowel movement, get up too quickly, change positions like going to sleep and lying down in bed, and sometimes after I eat.",90,50,2013-05-11,PHARMA,0.19368460774421692,0.776469886302948,0.02984553575515747

(Wall of text sorry)","Let me preface this by saying that I am an 18 year old male, going to college, no adhd or anything, but about a year ago I went to therapy for depression.

The past about month now, I have been getting an extreme amount of deja vu recently, not only that though, it will be in situations I know that I have never been in before, such as going in a store I have never been in before. Other times, I will walk in my house and everything will seem completely unfamiliar. Occasionally a very powerful memory will flash through my mind.

When it comes to all of these, for a moment I will see kind of bright light I guess. Not blinding by any means, but everything seem brighter. I will usually have trouble focusing my eyes after one of these incidents, and sometimes I will forget what I was doing or what I was saying in the middle of a conversation. Yesterday I almost lost 20 bucks because this happened and I forgot where I set it. 

At random times I will also hear noises that don't actually seem to be there, as no one else would react to them, not sure if that is related or not, as that is rare, though it has increased in frequency as well. 

These would happen to me occasionally in the past, but it never concerned me before as I am sure everyone else would occasionally forget what they were doing and such. But the past month now it almost always happens multiple times a day, and it is really starting to freak me out.",25,15,2013-05-11,PHARMA,0.10434836894273758,0.8585511445999146,0.03710053488612175
Health,Should I be concerned about unwanted weight loss?,"So, lately I've been reall stressed.  I've been trying to balance a lot all at once.  Recently, I've noticed I've been losing weight, and I think it might be a noticeable amount.  I just haven't been hungry, and when I do finally have time to make food, I just feel too lethargic to make food.  

Other symptoms besides lacks of hunger and weight loss would be fatigue, lethargy, a mild depressive feeling (probably from lack of energy), and heartburn; I'm tired a lot but I take ADHD medicine so it's hard to tell until it really hits me, plus I've been sleeping 6-7 hours a night.

I've already had mono so I don't think it's that, my lymph nodes aren't swollen, I've been making sure I drink plenty of water (even though I still feel thirsty a lot), and I haven't had any other noticeable symptoms like headaches or sore throats.  

Any thoughts?  Is it of concern?",37,11,2013-05-11,PHARMA,0.12697404623031616,0.8374232053756714,0.03560274839401245

Health,Girlfriend gets cold sores on lip(s) any time she walks barefoot on a hard surface. Any ideas?,"Her father has the same exact issue; any time she or her dad steps on a hard surface barefoot (tile, hard wood, linoleum, etc.) they will get a cold sore on one or both of their lips within 24 hours that last about 36-72 hours. Not but two weeks ago she took *one* step on to the laminated wood floor in our house before she realized her foot was bare, she had a sore by the time we went to bed. *ONE STEP.* If they have *any* barrier, such as socks or slippers, between them and the hard surface these sores never, ever present. What's more, her mother will get cold sores on one or both of her lips if she goes outside with wet hair. It doesn't matter if it's sunny, rainy, hot, cold, windy... She gets a sore within 24 hours that lasts 36-72 hours. Again, if she thoroughly dries her hair before going outside these sores do not present. 

I've tried to use Google to help find something, but I keep being led to stuff about chicken pox for some reason. Does anyone here at /r/health have any insight as to why the hard surfaces or exposure of wet hair to outside air/sunlight may trigger these sores?

I've been with my girlfriend for about six months, we are sexually active, and I have no symptoms that resemble hers, so I don't think it's anything contagious/viral. In addition, she has 4 sisters and *none* have this issue. Just her, her mom, and her dad. 

This question comes from curiosity from her and myself, not so much from concern. The sores do cause her pain, but she knows how to avoid them so it's not debilitating. I'm just extremely curious as I've never seen or heard about such a thing. Any insight, even stabs in the dark, is appreciated. 

Thanks /r/health!!

*NINJA EDIT: She can be barefoot on carpet or any padded surface without issue.*

*EDIT: Apparently socks don't prevent the sores from presenting. Only hard bottomed slippers or proper shoes provide a barrier.*",50,28,2013-05-12,PHARMA,0.0657319724559784,0.9099426865577698,0.024325307458639145

Health,I need your help..not entirely sure where to post this...Lost health insurance..big bills,"I'm a 20 year old male and I recently had a Ureteroscopy done. I had a 2.5 millimeter kidney stone removed. Before that I had two CAT scans done. One to find the stone and another to ensure it was still there after I hadn't noticed it in the strainer they gave me to use. 

This was all fine. I had insurance...all that.

The problem came when my dad (who currently pays for my health insurance) forgot to pay the bill for three months. How this happened is beyond everyone in my family. My dad pays his bills and has near perfect credit. He has been forgetting things recently but that's besides the point.

How the fuck am I supposed to pay for this?
Per state law when there is lack of payment it goes back to the last payment received and is canceled from then on. All claims are denied. We didn't receive word until a week after the procedure. So, right now I'm looking at a doctor's visit, a visit to the Urologist, a visit to my rheumatologist (Arthritis doctor), two CAT scans, and the Ureteroscopy. 
For the first two doctor's visits and blood work the bill is already 1,000 dollars
We don't know if the insurance company would allow my dad to pay the amount owed and reinstate coverage...we're doubting that but hoping. 
Another issue is that it is near impossible to get ahold of a REAL person from the insurance company on the telephone . I don't really know where to go, but if this belongs somewhere else, let me know and I'll move it. 

EDIT: I'm going to apply for medicaid now. Just to try. Anything at this point. Just got my first CAT scan bill. I know it wasn't my fault but I need to help my dad any way possible. This isn't really something that he can afford. He is planning on taking out a loan to cover the costs and then putting it on the second mortgage on his house.

medicine,How damaging is alcohol to cognitive performance?,"I've read papers reporting that alcohol intake shows a U-shaped curve [1], that is to say, generally both heavy drinkers and abstemious have a lower well-being than those who drink in moderate amounts. This is generally explained by saying that the benefits of the social interaction in moderate drinkers exceed the damaging effects of alcohol.

This studies apply however to the body as a whole, taking into account for example hepatic and coronary function, risk of stroke and diabetes.

I'm interested in knowing what are the effects of moderate drinking (4-5 drinks per week) only on the brain. For example, if there is any long-term impairment. Of course that the brain is impaired during intoxication, that is clear. But is there any impairment 1, 5, 14 days later? My main interest is on myself, early 20s caucasian male, but your answer may not be limited to this.

Also, do you personally drink? If yes, when and how much? If not, why?

Health,"Have felt like crap for years. I breathe through my nose almost exclusively. I started breathing through my mouth, and feel immensely better. What's wrong?","I'm going to try and get in with my doctor on Monday, but am curious if anyone has some insight into what's going on. I started breathing primarily through my nose years ago, and at this point, breathe through it almost exclusively.

I've also felt like complete shit for many years. I don't sleep well, am in mild to moderate pain all day, tight muscles, lots of cracking in my bones, my skin is slightly yellow, low back problems, the right side of my face is super tight, digestion is super slow, all sorts of issues.

A few days ago, I noticed I felt a lot better all of the sudden, and I checked in to see why. I had been on a foam roller on the ground and was breathing through my mouth. So for giggles, I took a bunch of deep breaths through my mouth exclusively and it felt amazing. So I put on my swimming nose clip and breathed through my mouth for the rest of the night, and felt so much better. The next day, I got some breathe right strips and felt great all day breathing out of my mouth primarily, and sometimes my mouth + nose. And my sleep that night was awesome. I normally wake up every couple of hours. I don't snore, but I can't stay asleep for more than a couple of hours. The next morning I woke up feeling refreshed for the first time in years. I've noticed that I still feel crappy if I breathe through my nose, even with the breathe right strips, but it's better than without them.

So I've been using a neti pot the last few days to clear out anything in my nose, and wearing breathe right strips pretty much 24/7. I'm also breathing through my mouth almost exclusively, which sucks and feels weird.

I'm pretty sure I have a deviated septum, plus some other stuff. My right nostril is a lot smaller than my left, and it's the right side of my face that is super tight and uncomfortable. Also noticed that when I use the neti pot on my right side, water comes out of my mouth at the same rate it comes out the left nostril. My right ear also squeaks like mad when I blow my nose after using the neti pot, like it's stopped up and releasing a little bit of pressure. It throbs for a few minutes (with my heartbeat) and then stops - I think it becomes stopped up again.

I do get ear infections from time to time (have had 2-3 in the last 5 years or so), although they've been in my left ear. I don't have a runny nose or sinus infections or anything that I know of. 

Anyone have experience in this and know what's going on? Again, am going to the doctor as soon as I can next week, but curious if I can learn anything about it before going in. Also, if there's any sort of treatment I can do to help this weekend would be great. My nose has been kinda runny and congested since I started using the neti pot, it's been a hell of a number of years, I'm ready for some relief!

medicine,"Accidentally recorded suicide attempt, due to hospital incompetence. What would you do?","Today, I was visiting a relative in the hospital. They have severe sleep apnea and resist using a CPAP machine. I thought that if I could record their sleep disruptions I might be able to convince them to try the machine.

Within two minutes of recording, a disturbance happened right down the hall. It turns out that a man, who was admitted under suicide watch, had been allowed to enter the shower and shut and lock the door. 

The result being that he tried to kill himself, leaving a bloody mess. 

My recording captured the entire aftermath, including the verbal reprimand of the person responsible for watching him. It seems as though the caregiver was not aware of the policy restricting suicidal patients from being allowed to lock themselves in the bathroom.

Is this a genuine accident, or is this negligence on the part of the hospital?

It really does suck to have this information and not know what to do with it. We are dealing with humans, and they really did respond quickly and sincerely. Is this commonplace, or is this hospital seriously negligent?

Health,"1 night in the Presidential Suite, InterContinental, Hong Kong: $13,500. 1 night in US hospital for a toddler: ~$13,000.","I pay for my family's medical. It comes out to around $850 per month for 3 people. The deductible for myself and my son is roughly $5000 per year.

We took our son to the hospital for a 1 night stay that included one or two antibiotic IVs and a lung scan (CT?). The price came to around $13,000, which was billed to the insurance company. The insurance haggled the price down to $6000, but we still had to pay 50% due to the deductible.

Today I went to a new family doctor for a referral to an endocrinologist. I filled out the required paperwork at home and waited for my turn. The doctor came into the room, asked a total of 5 minutes worth of questions, then I was on my way. 5 minutes is all the visit took. The price they are going to charge the insurance is well over $200. The cash price for this ""new patient setup"" visit would have been $190 without insurance. From my calculations, this doctor earns $2280 per hour for these first-time consultations.

Then we get into medicine. Insulin is a drug which cannot be made into a generic drug due to it [being of biological origin](http://www.dlife.com//diabetes/insulin/trecroci_122707). One vial of Humalog can cost around $300. My monthly prescription bill is around $300 with insurance. That's $3600 per year.

I know this pales in comparison to some people's medical bills, and I feel for them, but hopefully those people in more enlightened countries can see what we deal with here. Maybe some people here can become more enlightened too. If anything, personally I would just like the children to get free or cheap medicine.

medicine,Why is homeopathy being promoted by the (Canadian) health industry?,"&gt; Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. ~ Richard Feynman.

Homeopathy was pulled fully-formed from the ass of Samuel Hahnemann, circa 1796. Without troubling himself with such elitist Ivory Tower nonsense as ""evidence"" or ""proof"", he immediately set about treating patients and writing books about it.

I can't really comment on what Eastern traditions he may have been smoking at the time, but his theory doesn't make a particle of sense. It's a string of unwarranted assumptions, unsupported by any known scientific principles then or now, most of which are flatly absurd.

The core of the belief is *like cures like*: the idea that a disease with a given set of symptoms can be cured with some other substance that causes similar symptoms. There's no objective reason to believe this to be the case; Hahnemann didn't bother to confirm it: he assumed it was true.

He did know that giving somebody a substantial dose of poison was probably not really going to do them any good, so he gave them very small doses. Hahnemann didn't really know enough to figure out how small a dose is really safe, so he went overboard. Diluted the poison in water. A lot of water. He took a drop of that water and diluted it in a lot more water. And again and again. He concocted the loony notion that the more you dilute it, the more effective it becomes. There's no objective reason to believe this to be the case, and Hahnemann didn't bother to confirm it. He just assumed it to be true.

It can be shown that most homeopathic remedies are so diluted that they are statistically unlikely to contain even a single molecule of the medicine. Modern practitioners claim that the water retains some sort of ""memory"" of the medicine. There's no objective reason to believe this to be the case, and the handful of modern experiments that have attempted to prove it have either failed miserably to do so, or been so poorly-designed or conducted that their results can't possibly be taken seriously.

The whole ""water memory"" thing is really quite absurd. In the billions of years since water molecules first formed in the universe after the first generation of stars died, those molecules have been in contact with all sorts of crazy stuff. Stuff you don't even want to think about, let alone drink. The idea that they're remembering the things we want them to remember and forgetting all the other things is just ridiculous.

Homeopathy is placebo effect from top to bottom. It's fine to take it in conjuction with evidence-based treatments. But it's dangerous to promote it, because gullible people may choose to take it instead of actual physiologically effective treatments.

To some degree, drug companies are their own worst enemies. They are guilty of all sorts of abuses, I won't try to deny that. To some degree, government regulatory bodies like the American FDA become complicit in the abuses, because of the seemingly-inescapable reality of regulatory-capture. But ultimately, science is self-correcting. That is it's great strength over traditional sources of knowledge. Reality does not bow to our traditions; eventually the truth will come out. Science will correct itself and move on.

The self-correcting process may start slowing down in the near future, however, as some politicians have decided that it doesn't make sense to repeat an experiment that's already been done. They don't seem to understand that reproducing results is at the very heart of the self-correcting process. If repeating experiments is a waste of money, then perhaps those politicians can explain to me why I haven't yet seen a cold-fusion power source for sale at Future Shop.

I think that with the foundations of the Scientific Method and evidence-based medicine now quite well-articulated, we are much better at not fooling ourselves than we were in the time of Hahnmemann. It's a shame that what we teach as ""science"" in schools tends to focus more on teaching a laundry list of ""science facts"", and less on teaching people how not to fool themselves or be fooled.

Now on the [Health Canada website](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/branch-dirgen/hpfb-dgpsa/nhpd-dpsn/index-eng.php) it is written, ""Our role is to ensure that Canadians have ready access to natural health products that are safe, **effective** and of high quality while respecting freedom of choice and philosophical and cultural diversity.""

[Homeopathy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy#Efficacy) has never been shown to be **effective**.

If Health Canada promotes ""natural health products"" that are **effective** and homeopathy has never been shown to be **effective**, then why is Health Canada promoting homeopathic remedies, such as [Influenzinum](http://webprod3.hc-sc.gc.ca/lnhpd-bdpsnh/info.do?lang=eng&amp;licence=80006870), on its website?",22,23,2013-05-20,PHARMA,0.0954691544175148,0.8812946081161499,0.02323625236749649

Health,My boyfriend constantly has a blocked nose and has difficulty breathing due to it which makes him cough and be sick.,"Hi  

So my boyfriend seems to constantly have a blocked nose and produces a lot of mucus in his nose and throat (he's always having to blow his nose or do that hucking up mucus from his throat thing). He often breathes through his mouth because his nose is so blocked. It even gets to the point where it makes him cough so much he throws up (and this happens about once a month).  

Yesterday, for example, he was brushing his teeth and then I heard loads of really violent coughing. I figured out what was going on and went to check on him. Turned out a bit of toothpaste got stuck in his throat, he couldn't breathe through his nose and choked a bit, setting off the coughing and then vomiting. Obviously, this is not normal AT ALL.  

I'm really worried that there's something seriously wrong with him and that he might be doing permanent damage to his oesophagus due to being sick. He gets heartburn a lot, about 3-4 times a week, usually if he's not had anything to eat for a while (not sure if it's related). He doesn't have any known allergies to food or animals (we don't have pets), but he does get hayfever (although I think it's more exacerbation of what's going on already). I vacuum once a week, so dust isn't too big of a problem. He also smokes (about 5 cigarettes a day that he rolls himself).

Health,Grandma is killing me.,"My grandma was great and sassy when she was alive, but she's dying of cancer now. I've been taking care of her for over a year. She cant walk, she's heavily medicated, incontinent, etc. She cannot do ANYTHING. She is just existing. And I'm tired of taking care of her. I want to quit, but I'm wracked with guilt over quitting. I'm in school full time and I can't handle it. We could get a nurse, but I feel lazy for not just doing it myself. 
She doesn't have much longer, and the rest of the family is 2 hours away, working, etc. Her son is here to do the lifting and I get all the messy work because I'm a girl. 
They don't want to put her in inpatient hospice because ""she'll go faster."" At this point though, to me, it doesn't make a difference because her quality of life is shit. 
I've always been on the fence about voluntary euthanasia, but I'm all about it now. Years ago my grandma jokingly told her son to buy a gun after finding out she was showing signs of dementia. ""I don't want to live like that,"" she said.

Health,"'Empty Nose Syndrome,' 'Secondary Atrophic Rhinitis', whatever you want to call it- please consider helping those of us affected","In my life, I have been plagued by some rather annoying medical issues, but nothing serious. These have included GERD, chronic sinusitis, and very dry eyes. These issues have been manageable for a long time, but as I have grown older my sinus issues grew worse and worse. In 2012, two small colds left me out of commission with sinus infections for three months. I knew I had to do something.

I visited four different reputable ENT surgeons to get their opinions. There was one common denominator in all of these surgeons’ opinions: My inferior turbinates in my nose were very large and needed to be reduced. Each surgeon also recommended different procedures to open my sinuses. In medical terms, the procedure that I ended up choosing was a bilateral submucous resection of the inferior turbinates with outfracture, a bilateral maxillary sinus balloon sinuplasty, and a bilateral frontal sinus balloon sinuplasty. I scheduled this in December 2012 and hoped for the best.

Recovery went fine, but I almost immediately noticed terrible dryness. I had read that the risk of nasal atrophy, sometimes also called the Empty Nose Syndrome (more on this later), was rare, but possible with a procedure such as mine, as the mucosa that warms the inspired air was preserved and only the internal veins were sucked out (Think about the turbinate as an orange- the theory stands that sucking out the ‘fruit’ guts while leaving the rind in tact is the safest way to shrink things down while maintaining function).

Unfortunately, I began to notice more and more that I was becoming part of a very small percentage. My nose was dry as a bone to the point that every single breath burned, and nosebleeds were constant. I was extremely scared. I found support from my doctors, and from the Empty Nose Syndrome Community. It was here that I learned of different medical treatments that would make me more comfortable, although I am far from feeling great. I am forever in the debt of those kind souls on that forum for their words of hope while I suffered.

Doctors out there- ENTs, primary physicians, cosmetic surgeons. I beg of you. As an educated individual in the sciences, these turbinate reductions can go absolutely sideways. Please take care when doing these procedures, and please let me know if there are any new treatment options for these sort of issues. I never realized how many times a day we breathe. I would do about anything to stop my nose from literally bleeding in 85 degree humid weather.Before my turbinate reduction, I had absolutely no issues.

Thanks again for listening.

Health,Weird experience at work - what happened to me?,"I had a strange episode at work. 

Throughout the day, I started to feel more and more groggy. I was planning my vacation and had increasing trouble focusing on what I was doing. I had so much trouble making sense of the calendar that I went over to a co-worker for help. He had to help me count the days of the week out for me, I was so out of ıt.

When walking back, things got really weird. Everything got really spacey and 'slow-motion,' like I was walking through a dream. Everything people were saying to me or things that were happening felt far off and distant. I had trouble focusing on what people were saying to me.

I got to my office and sat down and start feeling really agitated and still unable to focus on anything. I start breathing deeply and got really fidgety and I felt really clammy and kept running my hands down my face. 

I ended up fleeing the building and taking a walk outside where I briefly felt a vague urge to throw up. I took a walk, found a quiet place in the grass, sat down and just closed my eyes and meditated. It was a very mildly trippy experience.

Now its passed and I am feeling back to normal. I still feel a little bit off.

So my question - what the hell did I just experience?",22,24,2013-05-27,PHARMA,0.10383290797472,0.8632575869560242,0.03290952369570732

I just need some assurance of this could it be true or not? I don't really care if she can't get pregnant or get her period, but I would love to know if what she's saying is true or not.

medicine,Inside the patient experience. I encourage you to watch this film.,"*Oh god, not another cancer movie.*, was what I thought when *Wit*  popped up in the auditorium instead of a dermatology slide presentation.  

It's not that I think cancer is unimportant or even boring (It's fascinating actually.) , but let's just say I wasn't excited to see yet another movie exploiting the suffering that cancer entails in order to emotionally move the audience.  

Little did I know, that the main character, played by the brilliant Emma Thompson, would be an scholarly woman that eloquently narrates her point of view as a hospitalized patient. I don't want to give too much away, but by the end of it I looked around and every single person was drenched in tears.
I think it's no secret to anyone on the medical business that dehumanizing patients is a common ocurrence. Another patient, another bed, another illness to diagnose and treat. And I know, I understand physicians can't go around grieving about every terminal patient, but *compassion and kindness* are overlooked as truly an important aspect of the medical profession, and I think this film reminds us that in a very real and humane way. It reminded me to never forget what patients go through (not only the cancer ones), and to not become a diagnosing robot.  (Also to be noted, is that the script is great. More so if you're a fan of John Donne.)

I don't want to post the trailer because it's sucks, but here's a small promo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vZNOIiX_l8

pharmacy,What will be the most stable pharmacist position in the next 10 years?,"Hey all, thanks for reading this. I appreciate your time. 

I'm a pharmacist, graduated from KU several years ago with my PharmD. I did a PGY-1 residency in the VA and then moved into a private hospital. I'm currently employed as a clinical pharmacy specialist at a private hospital in the Midwest. In the last couple years I've seen some troubling changes:

1. Upper management does not respect pharmacists anymore. The vast majority of times that I receive positive feedback are when I do something that saves money. They literally make all pharmacists sign-in each morning when we arrive, and I was written up for 3 tardies in which I was literally 1 or 2 minutes late. I couldn't believe it. 

2. When clinical positions become available, upper management is obsessed with hiring PGY-2 candidates. They won't even interview anyone else. This doesn't scare me now, but in 10 years? What then? Will they be trying to push me out so they can bring in someone who's a PGY-2 PharmD and also a Physician's Assistant? I'm serious, that seems to be the new trend. 

3. Raises don't even keep up with inflation anymore. 

4. Health benefits have been diminished practically every year. 

5. I'm in a state that is not passing the Medicaid expansion, and everyone in management is flipping out. They have literally told me ""We're in big trouble if the state doesn't pass this Medicaid expansion.""

My current options are:

A. Stick with current position and try to weather the storm.

B. Move and get back with Veteran's Affairs. I actually really enjoyed working in the VA. How competitive are these jobs now?

C. Try and get some other federal position such as FDA or BOP.
