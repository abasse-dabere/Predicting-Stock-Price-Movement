VACCINES,Do I have to worry about contracting rabies?,"Hey all, I’m going to give a quick story about when I was “bit” by a random dog.

About a month ago I was in Champaign at the time (college town). My friend and I were walking back from the bars when we saw a dog with no leash accompanied by 3 guys (it’s owner and friend). When the dog saw us he/she moved towards us, and began biting at our feet, (a form of protecting its owner)? The dog couldn’t be caught by its owner, total dumbass by the way, so the dog kept moving in circles around us and biting near our feet. As I moved away one time, the dog bit my calf, although it wasn’t really a hard bite it was more of like I said, seemed to be protective. A little red mark no significant bleeding. My friend and I at the time were just trying to get the hell away from the dog and we were intoxicated, obviously didn’t think about asking if the dog had a Rabies shot. Do you think I should be fine? The only reason I bring this up is because I’ve had back pain / neck pain on my right side recently and can’t find a diagnosis, getting an MRI soon. Curious to hear what others think. I know rabies extracted from a dog in the US is extremely rare so just looking for some reassurance/advice.",12,9,2019-09-01,PHARMA,0.08914592117071152,0.8768873810768127,0.03396674245595932

pharmacy,We need to unite before we lose our profession!,"This is solely my opinion but if chain pharmacy and independent pharmacist agree and unites I believe there is a fix to our situation. I think the independent pharmacist already know the issue but need the chain pharmacist on board to do something about it. Why the chain corporations don’t make this a priority and let the chain pharmacist know what’s behind the lack of raises, bonuses, store closings, and lack of tech hours I don’t understand! 
When we are not making any money, don’t get raises or enough techs hours we tend to think I instead of the bigger picture. Why are the big pharmacies cutting hours, firing pharmacist, not giving pay raises, not giving bonuses, closing 24 hour locations, closing stores? This is not a sign of too many pharmacist! This is a sign of a lack of money and greed! 
I have been a pharmacist for 21 years, 14 years at WAG and 7 as an independent. In those 21 years 17 were as PIC. I am going to mention my perspectives from both independent pharmacy and chain pharmacy as well. Everyone stay with me. 
Everyday as an independent pharmacist I run claims that lose money, have DIR fees that are through the roof and then chargebacks!  We don’t have a chance to survive if things continue as they are now. I don’t think there is an independent pharmacist that will disagree. 
My chain pharmacy perspective starts in 2001. I know starting between 2001 and 2008 Walgreens and CVS couldn’t open enough stores. They obviously were making money doing this or they would have stopped after the first year or two. I know my bonuses in those days were very good! The bonuses started decreasing in about 2012? What year was the big Tricare issue with WAG? 2012? What happened? After a couple of years WAG caved and accepted the lower reimbursement. I have heard that the PBMs do not affect the chains because they can buy so much cheaper than the independents. I agree they can but a cut is a cut and what happens when the CEO doesn’t make as much money as last year? He/she is replaced! Do you think he/she is going to cut his pay to make projections? He cuts your staff hours, bonuses, stores and etc. 
We have to remember it’s not just a your pharmacy problem but a nation wide problem. 
We have the same problem as independents and chains but because of the differences in title and separation of groups there is no union. I don’t think we need a Union to fix our problem but a government to get tough against the PBMs! We need to band together, write, call, email and fax our US and State Congress men and women about our issues. 
I believe it is unite and act or our profession dies! Do you agree?",145,181,2019-09-02,PHARMA,0.11503320932388306,0.8509345650672913,0.034032270312309265

medicine,"What is the right thing to do here? Hospital personnel with ethical concerns for a violent, disoriented geriatric pt who is now, out of necessity, almost always restrained.","I'm on a floor where the population post-leadership/administration transition has been changing. Many beds have been closed and all staffing has become bare bones: RNs, MDs, CNAs and security. We've always had tough patients (many indigent, overall extremely noncompliant). Pts used to be mostly CHF, ESRD, COPD, sepsis, EtOH, with significant psychosocial issues, but not as severe as they are currently.

 As the year has progressed, it's as if we have been slowly accumulating (gero)psychiatrically unstable pts in the area while having fewer and fewer resources to address them, as personnel flee this situation. We've been unable to find placement for some of these pts due to histories of violence, even in nearby tertiary/quaternary care facilities. 

We're a small hospital without any locked wards. We can't even close the doors to some rooms as some have MCI/dementia and require bed alarms to keep them safe, particularly overnight.

I've expressed to nursing leadership that this has become a significant ethical issue, and they've said some variant of, ""I agree! You should bring that up with someone."" Mentally I respond to this with, ""I thought I just did.""

Although we've had several disturbing incidents, what troubles me currently is a pt who is almost continuously restrained now. He's not a sympathetic character: he's either hit, kicked, spit on, or tried to do some variant of those to all of our staff. He cannot be let out of restraints because he is a serious danger to himself or others: he immediately tries to escape and falls, attack staff, or worse, attempts to enter other pt rooms.

For whatever reason his care seems to get delegated to the midlevels, who don't seem to be confident or experienced enough to change his inadequate medication regimen. According to one of the RNs who has recently cared for him, telepsych said his issues weren't psychiatric in nature (??) so a psychiatric placement was not possible. He has been medically cleared for months to my understanding. 

He is terrifying the other pts with his constant screaming of threats and profanity. One pt called 911 because she thought there was a fight going on. Apparently several law enforcement officers rushed on to the floor, hands on guns, ready to go. 

I have offered earplugs to patients so they could sleep. One of them said, ""No, I need to be able to hear if that guy is coming to my room."" I thought this was chilling, and totally INSANE. It's not like I wouldn't throw my body in front of a pt to keep them safe, but for one, what if I'm not nearby? And more importantly, why should this even be happening??

There are other pts like this, honestly some incidents with others are just as, if not more, concerning (bomb threats, suicide attempts). But this guy has to be restrained and some personnel have started closing the door to his room so others can rest. It makes sense, but how disturbing is it to close the door on a restrained individual?? No matter how often you check on them.

Please help with your advice. We're trying our best, but I just feel like we have no backup.",57,59,2019-09-02,PHARMA,0.14174506068229675,0.8329179286956787,0.02533698081970215

This post pertains to an earlier thread that has a lot of information, questions answered already.  Please see this thread  [https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/cwmdlc/would\_you\_be\_willing\_to\_sign\_a\_union\_card/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/cwmdlc/would_you_be_willing_to_sign_a_union_card/)

Would you as a pharmacist be willing to sign a union card? Union sign up cards are by nature never released to anyone except the National Labor Relations Board who determines if there are enough cards to require a vote to unionize. Please see below what will happen to your snail mail submission.

WHO AM I SENDING THIS TO?

My name is Jaleh Sharify, but I go by the nickname Amy. I am licensed in the state of Wisconsin and my license number is # 17662-40. I use to work for CVS and would never again. I am not afraid of them.

WHERE AM I SENDING THIS TO?

You can print out this form and mail it to me at 1515-B W. Fullerton Ave, Addison, Illinois 60101.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THIS?

Once I receive your signed card I will assign it a number, I will log information (no identifying information just non-identifying information) then take it to my bank which is Chase and store it in the safe deposit box that I already rent. I will report back to you all via this reddit site how many cards I have received in total, how many from each state, and how many from each company. Hopefully that will spur more people on to send in their card. If your company / hospital is small and there are not a lot of pharmacist employees then I will refrain from listing this information as I do not want to take a chance that there could be any repercussions. After receiving at least 250 cards I will come back to begin discussions regarding what needs to be in the agreement. The more cards that come in the more I will ramp up activities. Send in your card and let's get this ball rolling.

EDIT:

Pharmacists have more power than they give themselves credit for, but I know you are all aware of this power. If you are in a Right to Work State or a Non Right to Work State you still are in a state that requires a pharmacist licensed in that state to have an open pharmacy. If you are a factory worker in a Right to Work State and your union facility goes on strike for economic reasons can they just hire a number of people off the street to replace you while you strike? Yes. If you are a pharmacist in a Right to Work state and you go on strike or threaten a strike or imply a possible strike can they just hire a number of people off the street to replace you while you strike? No. Do they have enough licensed pharmacists for that state in upper management, as floaters, available in the area as unemployed or underemployed to replace you? Depends on the number they would have to deal with. The more people they have to deal with the less capable they would be in overcoming the situation. Many companies recently have replaced their pharmacist DMs or RMs with non pharmacy personnel. So, could chain pharmacy operations be slowed or even totally shut down if a percentage of pharmacists in a state threaten to strike? Probably not in one state unless it was a high population state such as Texas, California, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania. But if it was in two states, then I would say yes, and if it was in three states, most definitely. More than three states and I think you could throw a massive monkey wrench in the works....get more than one chain's pharmacists to participate and we would be unstoppable. How long would something like this have to go on before a huge economic pain would be felt by the chains? I believe not very long. Imagine a state like California with its chain pharmacy operations cut by 30%. Imagine now that both California and New York participated. The chains would be overwhelmed very quickly. Now add Pennsylvania and few smaller states and they would be totally at the mercy of the workers. Please start spreading the word. Talk to two or three pharmacists and let them know about this thread and how to find it. That is all people have to do to help propel this movement.

pharmacy,I'm in HIPAA/patient privacy purgatory at pharmacy.,"I'll start with the basics and work my way up from there.  I work in retail pharmacy.   I've been in pharmacy for since 2005.   I am also HIV positive (have been for around 35 years).   I've been on medication to treat HIV since January 2000.  In the 4 years I have worked at this particular location, I have missed no days at work and am pretty much considered the go-to senior tech to solve issues, but this one has me stumped.

Now comes the fun part.  I have managed to keep a wall of privacy up that keeps my team from being aware of my HIV status through the use of a third party pharmacy to fill my HIV medication (or at my previous pharmacy job, only certain employees had access to other employee health information).  Now the third party pharmacy is telling me I have to use my own pharmacy to fill my medication which means that literally everyone at my pharmacy is going to find out either in the course of filling my prescription for anti-retrovirals or otherwise.  

This feels a lot like forcible disclosure at work and I am at a loss as to how to handle the situation.   Should I get out ahead of it?  Wait until someone brings it up?  

There seems like there should be a better way to protect employee privacy, but I kind wanted to see what others thought so I could formulate a plan for dealing with this.",59,140,2019-09-06,PHARMA,0.0397707000374794,0.9213662147521973,0.03886306658387184

pharmacy,Board of Pharmacy visit,"Please be patient, my story is long.

A few days ago my hospital had the visit from hell.  The auditor came in, took a look around, Then went into the managers office and spoke with her for several minutes.  Meanwhile, Our order entry pharmacist got up from his desk to remove Versed from the CSM for a drip.  The auditor comes out and yells, Where is the pharmacist who was just sitting here.  The other technician and I had had our backs to the desk so we had no idea where the pharmacist was.  At this point, the director comes running into the pharmacy, and the auditor begins to lay into him. Didn’t you get my message that I was coming? Yes, but I was at (the other hospital) and came right away.  Couldn’t you drive any faster? He berated.  Startled, my director said, no, there are three schools between here and there.  You should have been here! He said, then yelled again, where is the pharmacist who was sitting here!  You are supposed to have constant supervision of these technicians!! They could be picking their nose!  If you aren’t watching them, you don’t know what they are doing!  They can’t be trusted!  

The abusive tirade continued, but I had to mentally close my ears off because I wanted to defend my my place of work and the good characters of all of my coworkers, but I also respect and admire my colleagues and place of work and we need that clean room certification!

What he did was wrong. I understand we need to adhere to cleanliness and that my labors are to be performed under the direct supervision of the pharmacist, but he was cruel, abusive, and harassing.  His distaste towards technicians was palpable.  The patients AND my pharmacists depend on me to perform to the utmost of my ability, and I know that I am a valuable member of my team, but he left me feeling like worthless trash.

Yesterday, I also found out two things:  at a neighboring hospital he actually made a tech cry.  After their certification, she brought in a cake for everyone that said f””k you Joshua.  Also, I found out he has a track record for taking techs to court.  I think he REALLY hates technicians.

This man came in and bullied us one by one, but I will not be bullied and feel I should report him. The saddest part of all?  Everyone is afraid of retaliation if I do, and we need that certification!

I would really appreciate any input on this!  And please answer this:  is the divide between RPh and techs really that bad?  If I decided to go to pharmacy school ( I live one mile from one!), would I magically become trustworthy???

medicine,Differences in human and animal vaccinations,"As I'm sure you've seen on the news, the east coast has recently had a number of cases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis and today someone died. This got my thinking a bit because there's quite a few diseases my animals are routinely vaccinated for that there is no human vaccine available for. 

&amp;#x200B;

My horse is vaccinated every spring for Eastern, Western and Venezuelan Encephalitis and West Nile. Dogs on the east coast get vaccinated for Lyme and some dogs also get vaccinated for lepto. Clearly there is the ability to make these vaccines so why is there no human equivalent? I'm sure part of it has to do with exposure and risk--an animal spends more time outside and is more likely to be exposed to some of these diseases. And I'm guessing the testing for human vaccines is a lot more vigorous than animal vaccines.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thought or experience? Apparently at one point there was a Lyme vaccine but fear caused it to be pulled from the market.

Instead of being eligible for state medical board certification after completion of intern year, new MDs will have to complete 3 years of residency training in order to apply for a full license. 

I am having trouble seeing this change in anything other than negative terms. First, this rule only applies to MDs. As far as I can tell, some providers such as NPs will still be able to obtain full prescribing privileges immediately after completing their graduate programs. 

Second, this would prevent MDs who decide not to continue with residency past intern year from obtaining prescribing privileges. Before, MD's with an intern year completed could choose to pursue other career paths, while retaining the ability to work part time in something like urgent care to help pay off loans or on a volunteer basis. This will no longer be possible without 3 total years of post-graduate training.

They just started the program this week and it’s been busier than she was told to expect. She’s rounding on 25+ patients each day, and doing 6-8 admits &amp; 5-6 discharges each day, plus the occasional consult. She’s also responsible for all the ICU patients during the day, there’s no in-house intensivist. 

She has some midlevel support, but they are all new-grad NPs. Additionally, the hospital’s policy is that the MD has to attest all of the midlevel notes, so they don’t really help cut down on the workload too much just yet.

medicine,"To those of you entering the profession or working your way here, the art of medicine is more important than the science of medicine","There is no doubt you will be well educated and well trained in the science of medicine. Statins post stroke, pneumovax to reduce lung abscesses, CAR-T for cancer, but I want you to start focusing on the human condition. This is not an exhaustive list by any means but is a start at how we should think of our fellow humans. I’m a hospitalist so I will try to only speak to what I know. Other specialties feel free to add.

Alcohol is not a problem. It is a solution to a problem. Don’t get frustrated that the alcoholic won’t stop if we don’t help with the problem.

On hospital day three of their pneumonia admission, your ten point review of systems is a lie. I propose a ten point review of who they are. Knowing who they are can sometimes give you better insight to their illness and sometimes just make the relationship stronger. Example, my dying cancer patient loved Texas hold em, playing a couple hands on day 20 before he died was more important than any ROS, exam, or meds I could give him.

Everybody around you is unique with their own anxieties and problems. That person who just got off the elevator, they might have just lost their newborn. That person who slammed the bathroom door might have just found out their spouse has cancer, that angry nurse might have a kid with special needs at home, that person holding up the cafeteria line might have just been told that their partner has Alzheimer’s. Be kind to everybody, the hospital is a very special place.

Don’t turn your back to the patient and type. Don’t stand up hovering over the bedside. Don’t not give silence a chance. These things are way more important than an S3. 

Don’t overvalue the risk of death. Specifically speaking about PEGs. Sometimes it’s ok to accept aspiration if death is not valued over eating. Better yet, don’t villainize vices at the end of life.

Opiates treat pain but cause suffering. Unless you are dying. BZDs cause way more anxiety when you try to remove them than the anxiety you were trying to treat in the first place.

Don’t lie to your patients. If they don’t take their asa, they won’t die. Learn how to couch it better or analogize it better. The odds are in their favor if they don’t take asa, but if they didn’t take it and got an MI would they regret it? Then it’s a discussion about regret mitigation. Whatever their choice, you’ll both be less frustrated and they will feel more respected and you will get more respect. Don’t lie.

Short of physically assaulting you, any abuse you get from patients or families is usually not personal and is the expression of the vulnerability and fear. Do stand up for yourself but give them the benefit of the worst of ourselves when dealing with the betrayal of our bodies.

Your career is an ongoing prospective trial with an n of one. Your value is standing up for the 95% of your practice that you can back up with your own well reasoned decisions. Don’t be dogmatic. 5% of your value comes from the margins of cognitive dissonance. If you don’t look, you will never see.

You are the right person for the job.

Last but most important. On death. We all die. We don’t all die the same way. Sometimes we die slowly on a vent and suffer to give our family the time to come to peace. Sometimes we take chemo for regret mitigation other times because we want our kids to know we didn’t quit even though we know we are dying. Sometimes our lives are robbed in the night and our families never get to say goodbye. The discussion around and about death is the most nuanced discussion you will ever have. Put your values aside. Ask questions and listen. Their motivations for delaying death are sometimes very meaningful and understandable even if you don’t agree with it. Don’t place the burden of removal of life support on the family, it’s not fair. Love and fear cannot hear reason.

The day you have no anxiety walking through those hospital doors is the day you hang it up.

Edit1: none of this is to say 95% of our job is not science a delivery of sound and safe practices. It’s in the margins of our job where science doesn’t explain the humanity of us all that we strive to excel and are called upon to deliver compassion. For the health of our patient yes, but also, more importantly, for our own health.

Edit2: my take on the abuse of residency isn’t a justification of other docs shitty behavior towards residents. If we accept the reality of shitty people and focus on learning how to face it we will have trained more resilient physicians. If you get humiliated during morning report, GOOD, take inventory of your ability to present and the holes in your knowledge. But it isn’t  advice to not stand up for yourself. Standing up for yourself doesn’t always mean going toe to toe with a curmudgeon, sometimes you stand up for yourself by being a better version of yourself. I have worked with all kinds of attendings, the ones with pure animus are far and few between. But on the wards in a high stakes environment tempers will fly.

There's some neurosurgeons who do 100% spine. They have absolutely zero interest in anything in the cranium; however, some of them take general neurosurgical emergency call. 

Anything cranial becomes a watch and wait with some, when a trip to the OR is clearly in the patient's best interest. Fortunately at one referring facility, in their ED, most of the time the EM staff and/or neurologists (unfortunately later) initiate the transfer for surgery.

It grinds my gears to see these neurosurgeons dilly dally instead of rapidly transfer a patient when they're uncomfortable with operating.

medicine,Learning opportunity: what is the solution to abuse in residency?,"So I posted a different topic yesterday and let’s just say it went a little sideways. Did some reading, called some attendings, feel like this is a worthwhile discussion.

Where my bias comes from is a product of my generation and training so let my lay my framework and see if we can reach some mutual understanding. Grew up in the eighties, it was a different time. Words back then didn’t carry the same social stigma now that they did then not to say the people hearing it weren’t hurt by it. Also, as a guy, ribbing each other was constant and could get cruel and mean but most everybody got along. Bullies were usually physically intimidating or small guys with larger than themself personalities. Trained in a community hospital and now work in a University hospital and community hospital. 

In training we had three abusive attendings and one I didn’t get along with. One, let’s call him Dr R would get off the handle and berate some of my seniors. I never saw the wraith but after commiserating with a colleague we could see how bad it could be for some people. My response when I had interns was to prepare them for his pimping and step in and take the fall if they didn’t have the answer. He once yelled at an intern who was 6+ ft and when the intern stood up he walked away. The other was a Dr J, he was just a cantankerous little doc and he once berated an attending from behind thinking it was an intern and was mortified when they turned around. Still remember what she said, you shouldn’t apologize to me because I’m an attending, you just shouldn’t talk to anybody that way. There was a Dr C who wasn’t ever verbally abusive but you wouldn’t get the same teaching if he didn’t think you werent interested. Amazing teacher though if you got his teachings. The only one I didn’t get along with, not to say people got along with me, was a Dr M who started yelling at me when I shielded my interns. Well, we got into it, told her that the only people with a right to yell at me are my parents, that ended with a meeting with the associate program director and a truce. We never really got along after that but remained professional. Program director never put up with it and let’s just say they won they lost the battle but won the war. 

Now at work, there are some people who are, who carry a reputation for being real tough/mean. Most trainees who finish that rotation actually love them and remain in correspondence in their professional careers. Most others are generally nice and well-liked. Definitely there are surgeons around and senior fellows who carry unbecoming dispositions but by and large it seems things are ok. Here’s where my gap in understanding this comes. We have been having memos going around about abuse and microaggressions and so it must be an either large group of residents or a very vocal minority who don’t feel how I do. I’m about ten years out of training. 

As for me, my teaching style is best described, from my reviews, as not hands-on enough to gives great autonomy. I do morning rounds but don’t bedside round on all cases. I give short related talks to the case at hand. I give afternoon teaching sessions on Bayes theorem and the mathematical nature of diagnosis, biomed stats talks, ethics talks, billing, and whatever clinical stuff they are in to. I never make them feel small at the bedside, I don’t round in front of other teams, and I lay out very concrete expectations. I don’t generally give feedback at the end of the week but pepper it along as we go. I don’t sandwich. I take a more coach athlete approach. I’m a very happy person but have been told by friends I may be mean sometimes. I like Dr Cox from scrubs but no better than to be him. 

So surveys from 1990 and more recently show basically the same thing. Residents feel abused, about 20%, consistently, and 80% of graduating residents feel they have been abused at least once. Work hours remain long but are down from the past. Doctors continue to commit suicide at much higher rates then the public. I won’t even begin to speak about sexism since I’m not a woman but I’ve seen it and heard about it and it remains a problem. 

So thanks for getting this far, that being said:

To what extent is the abuse a systemic problem? To what extent is it a problem of individuals?

At what point does the feelings of the abused an internal problem and not an external problem? This is not a generalization and I understand it’s a very nuanced problems.

What factors such as sleep deprivation, large quantity of material to learn, emotional stress of practicing medicine/surgery play into augmenting the feelings of being abused?

What is the true role of medical education?

What does my generation not understand? Not speaking for all of us. 

Is physician burn out a system problem or a personal problem? Since it isn’t a binary problem, where on the spectrum are we?

My sister was a straight A student in undergrad and her P1 year, but she’s struggling this year.

I think it’s because 1. she moved out from my parent’s house (now she has to pay for her tuition, rent, and other expenses herself &amp; she has to do housework) 2. she’s an e board member of three different clubs 3. Is an ambassador 4. is an intern at two pharmacies (Walmart and hospital) and 5. she knows the bad job market, so she’s even thinking about dropping out of pharmacy school.

She told my mom she cried in the school library while studying, and my mom thinks she might have depression and I’m very worried.

I am thinking about stopping by her apartment to bring her some food and gifts to let her know we care about her, but don’t know what she’d like.

It doesn’t have to be pharmacy-related. Any gift suggestions for someone who recently moved out?

pharmacy,As a Nigerian Pharmacist.,"I graduated this year and will begin my Internship this year's end or next year. I am working as a retail Pharmacist for the mean time just to get familiar with patients and how things are practically, while i scout for Internship centers which isn't easy as there are not enough.

After reading posts here about how messed up the system is all over the world, it makes me wonder.

Over here, things are in dire need of being fixed.
Drugs as basic as antibiotics can be procured without a prescription, which has become the norm.

In my Retail Pharmacy, i have two sales girls (no training of any sort) who help pick the drugs, cost them and give out reciepts. One day, i left for a couple of minutes. In that short time a woman (foreigner) came with a complaint that her baby of 2 months had diarrhoea for a couple of days and wanted something to help.

Apparently, one of the girls actually gave her 4% Metronidazole susp, and the woman was adamant that unless a doctor gave her a prescription she wasn't going to collect an antibiotic.

Luckily, i arrived on time and just gave her some electrolyte replenishers and informed her to see a physician in three days if it continued.

This kind of situation is not limited to just our Pharmacy, because not all of them have trained personnel to attend to patients properly.

The problem was if the woman was not a foreigner and wasn't familiar with the norms of prescriptions, i definitely knew that she would have taken it ignorantly and given a wrong dose to her baby.

Before i became the Pharmacist in charge the girls were the ones running the Pharmacy, and it scares me the amount of drugs they have sold (i can't in good conscience use the word, dispense) to patients.

The situation is so bad anybody can just erect a shop and call it a pharmacy. Every once in a while the government closes an illegal pharmacy but it's not enough.

Patients are surprised when i tell them that antibiotics should be taken for at least a week to ensure complete chemotherapy.

The positive is that some are responsive to my counselling while some are just so stubborn its infuriating.

Considering the 1:8000 Pharmacist to Patient ratio in the country i hope the profession is more marketable and actual Pharmacists take charge, because i fear for some patients honestly.

medicine,Do you ever check in on your grandparents or parents records? I decided to check on mine after a long demise,"My grandfather passed away approximately a year ago.

Today I decided to go through some of his items. I decided to thumb through some of his previous medical records in a file I found.  

He is always been pretty private about his medical conditions. Didn't ask for much in terms of advise and....well I didn't want to ask too much since he didn't want to talk about it. He would always want to drink a Lone Star when I would come visit him and bullshit with me. So, we drank beer, ate some cheese, and talked about life / women / guns / cattle / religion (The Texas pentad as we can call it) .  He was 87 when he passed away, had COPD on 4 L of home O2, A. fib, CAD with previous stents.


When I entered medical school and throughout my training his COPD really started advancing.  He spent the last 3 to 4 years of his life more or less bedbound and could only walk between the couch and the bed without significant shortness of breath.


Thumbing through the records were a bit eye-opening.  It looks like his primary care doctor was more or less giving him monthly to semi-monthly methylprednisolone injections, he had a sleep study done, he had 5 echoes outpatient, an MRI brain for tremors in his last year, he had for stress test EVERY YEAR in the last 4 years of his life, and had a few CT scans of the chest when he had bronchitis.  Keep in mind, he could not walk more than 50 yards.

So with this I couldn't help but think of how everything could have went so wrong.

I remember having end of life discussions briefly while talking about religion with him and he would always tell me, he is ready when it is his time to go. But looking at the advanced directives portion of the primary cares note.....this part is left blank. 

Even at the end of life this man was ready to go but had only talked about end of life care with my mother and my grandmother. My mother happened to have MPOA. 

He fell, broke his hip and you all know the rest of the story. He was then intubated, was hard to get off the vent, sent to a LTAC and for weeks my family argued over how things would go while the brothers and sisters of my mother filed lawsuits against my mother since she was MPOA and my grandmother did not want to make a decision since they claim they never heard those wishes and that he was on benzos when he filled out any legal paperwork. Some of them kept leaning on data like his stress test looked good a year ago or his MRi brain was perfect a year ago.

In the end, my grandfather died of pneumonia, never woke up, and it ripped a family apart. Not to mention about 2 months worth of ICU stay.

I tried to speak up during this but only got pushed away and eventually legal contacts from their lawyers to basically stay out of this or else risk being sued and even a phone call where he threatened to report me to the board for offering medical advise without being the attending physician. 

Looking through the bills from the hospital stay that medicare paid for, it totaled well over 200k for the last month of his life. That doesn't include the stress tests that were done and all the other Rxs he had prior to his death.

This whole situation has really hit home for me for my elderly patients. Now I don't wait to their annual physical to ask about advanced directives. I have seen first hand how it ripped an extended family apart and caused the slow painful death of a man who for years would tell me and my mother that he didn't want that.

I don't blame any particular individual in this case. Everyone including myself could have done better and in a way contributed to the eventual outcome. I just wanted to share my story for you fellow docs can put a bit of realness to what happens when shit isn't documented and hopefully it might make us all take a second look rather than clicking that button (discussed advanced directives with patient to hit those medicare metrics).",100,589,2019-09-17,PHARMA,0.0917612686753273,0.882112443447113,0.02612624503672123

pharmacy,Dear pharmacists: please don't berate your techs. I'm begging.,"Dear pharmacists,   


We understand you're stressed. We understand about quotas, the increasing demand of patient adherence, all of the important aspects of making sure everything is regulated and thoroughly verified. We try so fucking hard to be the backbone, to help you out with the small meticulous things that would facilitate the process of slinging out pills for the patient easier. And I'm sorry that we're in such a high-stress, high-demand to make sure every prescription gets processed, every label gets printed out, all interactions are safe, that everything is peachy keen for anybody who walks into the pharmacy.   


But please understand us techs aren't your punching bags. Especially some of the community pharmacists who have it harder because of also managing a small business. But please understand that spitting at us, snapping your fingers at us, berating us and calling us dumb or retarded isn't going to help us improve as technicians. This isn't going to be a #notallpharmacists mantra but for some of those pharmacists who aren't good at coping with stress, please don't take out your frustrations at your colleagues.   


Truth be told, I'm a licensed pharmacy technician and had two externships, and recently resigned from a tech position at a community pharmacy. I was berated, belittled, undervalued and my boss, the lead pharmacist, ridiculed me for every little mistake I made. And god forbid I actually did do my best. I did my best to journal notes, ask questions, and bottle up every time my boss used me as a punching bag. I was the only technician working there and processed +200 scripts alone at certain times. I apologize if I am whining but I really did try my best. What broke the straw on the camel's back was when my boss spit at me, snapped his fingers at me, and would whistle at me like a dog whenever a patient came into the pharmacy and he was busy being in a phone call with his friends. I didn't even put in my two weeks notice, I just left the letter of resignation on his throne, his chair that he had in one of the aisles of his pharmacy that he retreats to whenever he goes into hour long calls with his friends while I'm multitasking a lot and he would aggressively react whenever I had to interrupt his phone calls because a patient needed his consultation.   


I tried my best man. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm venting like this but this is months and months of trying to cooperate with pharmacists who at the end of the day, saw me as an inferior lowly slave tech. I did my best to not let it affect me. I really didn't. I tried to grin and bear it but it became too much. Today I was just bawling in front of a patient after my now recent ex-boss shooed me away when I tried to ask him to help me with this patient needing some crucial information about their medication history. And I apologize for making them feel awkward. I just couldn't bear it anymore.   


I cried in the bathroom multiple times. I understand in this line of work you're supposed to just grow desensitized over time, but when enough is enough? "" Maybe pharmacy just isn't for you. ""   


Maybe I'm just some sensitive fairy but I'd like to think kindness can also be expressed in a way where it isn't perceived as weakness.   


Just please. Please don't use your fellow techs as punching bags. Because some of us just can't take the punching anymore and just leave.   


I don't know if I ever met his expectations of being a competent technician. It was my first pharmacy technician job. But I can only hope that this experience isn't reflective of pharmacists as a whole. Please tell me, since many of you are pharmacists yourself, that there are workplaces that doesn't display power imbalances and abuse of it. I don't want to give up working in the pharmacy field. I really don't. Maybe it's too much of me to ask of this, maybe it'll just be argued with the idea of social darwinism but only in a pharmacy. But overall, I can only hope someone on here can relate to what I experienced and somehow tell me everything will be okay eventually.   


So please. Please be kind to your techs. That's all. Because in my case, I just left because I just couldn't handle it anymore.

medicine,Mental burden of residency,"Holy cow. Just now reading an email from a couple of months ago (combination of being behind in email and avoidance coping).

For background, I tried to start 2 research protocols in residency. I spent about a month right before residency started writing up the first one. We lost the therapeutic capability needed for it as I was finishing it up and it went down the toilet. The 2nd one was a study to validate a screening questionnaire. I was going to recruit several hundred volunteers over the course of 3ish years to see if this screening tool worked. I was supported in both of these by an incredibly kind and patient mentoring doc who works for the hospital's research department. He held my hand every step of the way and never pressured me unduly.

This protocol went to the IRB multiple times. They shot it back at every step with a bunch of concerns, some of which were valid and some of which felt \*very\* much like contrived roadblocks to prevent anything but an absolutely \*perfect\* protocol from making it through. This protocol has been sitting on the back burner for the past year since graduating. I added a resident 2 years behind me and he has done just about nothing for the project. I haven't put in much more work because a) still \*really\* busy since graduating b) avoidance bias (see above).

I got an email from the nice mentor doc a couple of months back. I've tried to read it a couple of times but haven't been able to bring myself to do it. I knew it was going to say, essentially, that the protocol is dead. I feel like I let him down. I feel like I let the other attending whose idea this whole screener was down. I feel like I didn't adequately prioritize this work during residency (even though I \*know\* that I, like my classmates, was dying under the crushing load of residency and didn't have anything left to give).

So now I just opened up this email and started reading. It says pretty much what I thought it would in the same kind, supporting, non-judgmental tone I anticipated.

\*\*And I am freaking the fuck out\*\*

This feels like a low-grade panic attack. My hands are shaking. My heart is racing. My thoughts keep running to suicide, an oldie-but-goldie coping strategy; yes, I know it's bad and counterproductive and yes, I've been trying to work my way out of it over the past year, but holy cow did it ever come rushing back like a freight train. I am \*\*amazed\*\* at how strongly these feelings came out of nowhere. I don't really know what to do with it (other than the obvious answer of ""go seek the mental healthcare that you fear will jeopardize your future"").

Anyone else have any sudden flashbacks like this? Anyone else out of residency but still struggling with the weight of it? Anyone else wondering if they'll ever be able to have a ""normal"" career in medicine?

For those who read this far, thanks for listening. I'm honestly just typing this out because I feel like I need to put words down somewhere and it helps to feel like somebody's listening.

P.S. no, I'm not actively suicidal; like I said, an old inappropriate coping strategy that I recognize is bad.",14,57,2019-09-17,PHARMA,0.09015972912311554,0.8789650797843933,0.030875172466039658
pharmacy,Pharmacist to District Manager question?,"This is a question for anyone who has been working as a pharmacist for a chain and then transitioned into being a DM.

In all seriousness, how do you take your job seriously? Making sure all the stores are meeting their metrics and goals...

it seems to be that anyone who has been trained to critically evaluate statistics and numbers could see clear as day that the performance metrics of the chains don't have any correlation to most anything in reality.

pharmacy,Do your nurses do these things?,"I’m a pharmacist at a critical access hospital.  Our nurses run the place and are never held accountable for their actions.  We had a patient who was in severe pain from an accident.  He was on fentanyl q1h PRN, and Norco PRN. The patient had received 9 doses of fentanyl over 24 hours, plus 3 doses of Norco.  Our nurses called the attending doctor asking for a fentanyl patch.  They told him the patient was getting fentanyl every hour (he wasn’t).  He ordered a 50 mcg patch.  The patient was opioid naive.  The nurse pulled the patch on Override before I had even seen the order (they’re not supposed to override when I’m on duty).  I saw the order and was looking more into the patient’s history to decide if it was appropriate- it wasn’t.  I knew I needed to call the doctor.  I called the nurse and told her not to give the patch, as I need to call the doctor.  She said she had already put the patch on the patient.  I asked them to take it off because I need to talk to the doctor about it.  They said ok.  I documented the conversation.

I left a message for the doctor.  He came in a few hours later to make rounds.  The nurses had refused to take off the patch.  It had been 4 hours since I told them.  They were telling the doctor that the patient needed it. I talked with the doctor in private and he argued a little bit saying this is a big patient and he needs the patch for pain control, even though he’s opioid naive.  I remained calm and gave him the alternative options.  He finally agreed to change the meds.

Later, the nurse (whom I had earlier asked to remove the patch) was at the nurses station complaining and ranting about how the patient should be on the patch and these other pain meds just weren’t going to work.

I don't know how they could have imaging more advanced than a CT scanner or 2 on site. Are these just glorified urgent cares?

medicine,How do you deal with rude/unprofessional managerial staff?,"Having an issue with a nurse manager who is now getting other staff members upset and I am unsure what to do.

A nurse brought a concern to me about a patient being severely fatigued during the day on an ongoing basis and was concerned it was their medications. After looking at their history and finding this was unlikely the issue, I observed the patient having a 10 second apnea episode while napping and decided to order a sleep study to rule out sleep apnea as the issue making him fatigued during the day.

The nurse manager questioned the respiratory therapist about why this was ordered, who would be paying for it and made a comment to the effect of me not knowing anything and we have the same degree and clearly I did not learn anything during my degree program (nurse manager has an MSN....in administration, so not clinical). 

The sleep study ended up getting done which showed severe sleep apnea and their fatigue was greatly improved on the CPAP. Nurse manager wanted the RT to not show me the results of the test and instead show someone else instead because again, I don't know anything. The RT told her even if she showed the pulmonologist, the results would be the same. The nurse manager said all of this stuff at the nursing station in front of a whole bunch of staff.

Last week as I was getting on the elevator, she went up one side of me and down another for changing someone's diabetes meds ""when the patient has been stable for so long."" I am a certified diabetes educator and board certified in advanced diabetes management, so I definitely know more than a little about diabetes management and wanted to get the patient down on insulin as much as possible (patient was only on insulin and nothing else with great renal function which made no sense where they have T2DM). She accused me in front of other staff in the elevator and at the nursing station of not knowing what I am doing and not knowing how to manage diabetes and I had to painstakingly explain the labs I checked to show they're still making endogenous insulin and we should try sensitizing them to insulin to lower their weight and insulin requirements and the patient was fully on board with this and wanted it.

I am unsure what to do at this point. Other staff have reported her to the Director of Nursing, I told my practice medical director today and he was very supportive and said the manager has had lots of personal conflicts in the past and doesn't get along with anyone really. I've never run into this problem and every other manager and DON I work with I have a great relationship with. She is constantly second-guessing my clinical decision making and if those sleep study results had been hidden from me and tucked away, it would have affected the patient's care. She also doesn't want us ordering vaccines for patients who need them ""because they're all going to die soon anyway."" I don't want her to undermine my clinical decision making or make nurses not trust my clinical judgment but I am not a confrontational person unless I absolutely have to be. Was hoping to get some advice/guidance here how to approach this.",116,342,2019-09-23,PHARMA,0.06343507766723633,0.9062504172325134,0.03031451813876629

pharmacy,Tour of Hospital Pharmacy After Interview,"So, this has happened after two hospital interviews and I'm completely confused about it. 

What the hell do they want from me during the tour? 

A tour is, in my understanding, a way to get more interaction with the candidate in a different setting to get to know more about them. 

My problem is, the tour is always them dragging me into a completely new environment (hospitals are like mazes and it's my first time seeing each facility) then bombarding me with info about their workflow that I have no idea what to do with. 

I just nod and say okay, but what are they even looking for? Am I supposed to be finding and pointing out mistakes? Am I supposed to be going ""oh yeah, I know all that already""? How do I engage with the material when it's obviously all new? None of it is ""actionable"" information to me. 

""This is the vestibule where everyone has to gown up before entering the clean room. You can see Brenda over there getting into her gown and putting on her face mask""

Okay

""New orders and supplies all come through this room, they need to be wiped down with cleaning solutions before being passed through this window into the clean area""

Alright, cool

""And this side of the room is used to prepare any investigational drug solutions that any of our research teams order, if you end up doing any of that kind of work""

Ok, interesting 

""Do you have any questions for me so far?""

You just gave me a brief overview of a work area that I dont yet have hands-on experience with, so no, I don't have any questions right now. 

But since I've had multiple interviews, multiple tours, and no job offers, I can't help but feel that something is going wrojg at the touring step of the process.

I smile, nod, pay attention and try to absorb as much of the new info as possible, but I still can't imagine what they would want from a candidate at that stage besides someone saying they are already knowledgeable in what they're being shown, which isn't really possible since they already have my application and know this is my first hospital position after retail and claims processing. I do have background working with clean hoods and with aseptic technique because I have a biochem degree, but it doesn't seem appropriate to try and just 1-to-1 apply my previous knowledge to this new setting.

That's all my complaining. 

Anyone that actually does interviews: what is the purpose of the facility tour and what do you want to see from candidates during it?",17,23,2019-09-24,PHARMA,0.04721884801983833,0.9216316938400269,0.03114941343665123

pharmacy,I'm in the unenviable position of having to fail a student,"Attention pharmacy students.  If your preceptor tells you he wants a draft by Monday, that does not mean he wants an outline that is maybe half filled in.

So why not just use etomidate or ketamine?

medicine,osteoporosis-mediated effects of space travel,"hey [r/medicine](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/)!

I'm doing a presentation on the effects of spacetravel on the human body. One of the things i'd like to highlight is the higher risk of kidney stones as a result of osteoporosis releasing quite some calcium in the blood. (further reading: [https://www.iofbonehealth.org/news/link-between-space-flight-and-osteoporosis](https://www.iofbonehealth.org/news/link-between-space-flight-and-osteoporosis) )

What I was wondering: could the elevated calcium levels in the blood have any effects like cardial arrythmias or other symptoms?

pharmacy,I don't know if this kind of post is allowed but sometimes I just get so unreasonably mad at pharmacy work. Is there a rant thread?,"It keeps me up at night when I get triggered thinking about it. Why the hell do we have to lose money to fill medications that patients actually need? And before you say that high paying claims balance it out, medications shouldn't be such astronomical prices anyways. It's like CEOs giving themselves huge raises and then ""taking"" pay cuts to give a bit of a raise to employees who were underpaid anyway, woo fucking whoo.

Fuck goodRx. I feel bad denying them when they're literally the only way pt can afford life saving meds but wtf do we do when we literally have to pay them to fill the scripts? They only serve as bandaid to the messed up system the US healthcare is, and I feel like it's predatory to try blind the people from being motivated to find real solutions.

Dont get me started on lawmakers. Wtf did the ""you must display price of medication in your ad"" do anyway? I just started watching TV again and all I can see is ""you may pay as low as $0 in copays with our coupon visit our website to learn more"" which probably they dont qualify anyway, or if they do it's some *trial* coupon that's only valid for first fill or something. They dont care about fixing the problem, they care about getting some pr points by addressing what general public thinks is the problem.

 Cheap ass insurance that needs to get PA for every single new script of the maintenance meds that patient has obviously been taking for a while, it's obvious they know pt needs it, or why would they grant PA every time? It only prolongs when the patient gets the med when they run out of refills and somehow it's always pharmacy 's fault. ""What, again? You know I've been getting this medication for years! Why do I have to wait for your lazy ass to do your job so I can take my LIFE SAVING MEDICATION on time? I'm gonna be OUT"" - well, maybe you should call ahead if you know this is gonna be a thing every new fill Karen??

Dr.s that send prescriptions for medications that's been discontinued for years. Then not answering phone calls. Why???

I don't know if it's just my area but our wholesaler delivery is wildly unreliable. We frequently get orders 3-4 hours late. Guess who gets yelled at by customers for that? Hmm.

Like honestly, I love working at pharmacies. Seriously. I can't think of doing anything else. But it's just so frustrating if something like orders being hours late, or dr not sending PAs, things going on back order and such prevents me from providing care to keep people healthy. Sometimes I just think there needs to be an outlet to rant about it to get it out.",58,111,2019-09-28,PHARMA,0.11855969578027725,0.8531160354614258,0.028324313461780548

medicine,Job Interview - who pays for what?,"Current PGY4 in Anestheisa on the west coast - looking for job on the west coast. In prepping for interviews, I had read some articles about how typically the potential employer will pay for the resident to come out and interview.

Some even go so far to say, a practice not paying for travel and lodging for a potential physician should be considered a ""red flag."" Thus far, I have reached out to, and received interviews from 5 separate private practice groups in SoCal. None have offered travel and lodging. I spoke to an alumni and she laughed when I asked if KAISER would pay for travel and lodging. 

Any previous experience with this? Is this something I have to ask for? I think it's kind of absurd that they DON'T pay for it.
