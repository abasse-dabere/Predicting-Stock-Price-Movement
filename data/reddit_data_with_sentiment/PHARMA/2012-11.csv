Health,"poisened wheat gluten- In 2007 my best friend, my dog, was killed by tainted dog food. In 2012 more dogs died. Pigs and other edible animals are also fed this poison.","My dog was only 7 years old (very young for a mini dachshund) when he died. I was devastated, heartbroken, and confused.  When I found out he was killed by tainted dog food I became angry. With the recent spike of dog deaths from a similar cause in 2012 I want to raise awareness so no more dogs die.  Also humans are at risk.

I learned that Chinese manufacturers were adding Melamine to the wheat gluten in dog food.  As the admittedly sensationalist ABC articles below points out, the chemicals were added intentionally. They wanted to save costs and boost apparent protein content.
From 2007
http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=3058844#.UJHoYWdL2RI
I was veg. at the time (so not too worried about heating Melamine- fed pigs) but I hoped that none of this made it into food for human consumption (wheat gluten is not just in animal food obviously).  

I thought, stupid me,
""this will never happen again, the FDA is aware of the problem and they will hold the dog food manufacturers responsible, carefully test ingredients and products brought from china""  NOPE

This past summer I realized more deaths have occurred over the years, as I heard that more dogs were dying after eating certain dog foods and treats.
""The FDA has issued three separate warnings about Chinese jerky treats in the past four years [but] it has yet to find a ""definitive cause"" for the mystery ailments, it hasn't blamed Chinese treats for the illnesses, it hasn't named any of the well-known American firms like Purina that sell them, and it hasn't recalled any of the products.""
From 2012 (warning; cute pug)
http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/toxic-treats-china-killing-us-dogs-pet-owners/story?id=15927579

The CDC noticed that from '05-'10, human people have been affected with thousands of illnesses associated with imported food, 45% of which came from asia.

The first story made me cry- so similar to mine; we ran out of our pricey (but healthy) dog food and got a local brand (made in china) to tide us over the weekend. I still miss him.

They can't even test for the poisons, because they can't identify the toxin(s) causing the dogs deaths (other than melamine).

medicine,Flair has been enabled - details inside,"Hello Medditors,

Due to popular request, flair has been enabled. Since it's impractical to create flair templates for every possible specialty and location, you'll be able to edit your own flair. In an attempt to have some consistency, I'd recommend that people stick to the following template:

Degree or title - Specialty (if necessary) - Location (if desired)

For example:

    MBBS - Pediatrics - London
    RN - Emergency
    MS2 - Cleveland
    Paramedic - Los Angeles

Feel free to leave stuff out if you like, flair isn't required. Shorter is better. Please recognize that these designators aren't verified at all, so while they may appear to grant authenticity, they do not do so in any way. Also, people may do more than what their title would initially imply, so inquire before you judge. Lastly, judge primarily on submitted content, not title.

Health,"Suffered from IBS for nearly 4 years.  32f, otherwise healthy.  Tested negative for celiacs.  Spent the past few months cutting out gluten and most carbs and have seen some overwhelming benefits!","Hi everyone.  Just wanted to pass along this personal success in case it helps anyone. 

I have suffered from IBS for about 4 years.  32 healthy female aside from this.  It came about after several courses of the medication Accutane (acne treatment) which has been later implicated in several digestive disorders.  I can't specifically say it's the cause but never had any problems before taking it.  

I had every test possible and the only conclusive evidence was that my digestive track was inflamed but no cause has ever been identified. So, I was slapped with the 'catch all' IBS.  I was tested for gluten sensitivity twice (years apart) and both came back negative.  

In my constant attempts at getting better and after a conversation with someone else who experienced success, I finally cut out carbs and gluten even though the doctors didn't think it was a cause.  After 1 month of being diligent on this (I have a few cheats), I have found near total success.  My stomach issues are soooo much better and most days have zero problems.  And, each time I have cheated with carbs, I have noticed that my symptoms come back but at a much lesser scale.  And I feel better, cravings are limited and I have lost a few pounds even though I wasn't trying :) 

So for anyone that may be in the same position and tested negative for gluten sensitivity/celiacs, it could be worth your efforts to try to give them up for a few months to see if it helps!  I know this won't work for everyone and it may not work for anyone but I wanted to pass along in case I could help.  I can't tell you the frustration I have felt over the past years and if I only knew this cutting these out would help, I would have done it!

Health,Avoid a cold this winter with these steps!,"5 Steps to Avoid Getting Sick - My Proven Methods

I used to get sick at least two times a year during college. Everyone knows the common cold just sucks.  After my last cold I changed some basic habits, and since I haven't not had a cold for almost two years. With the following steps you won't have to avoid your sick loved ones or friends; your body's immune system will be a fucking god. 

1.  Wash your hands. Yea, every parent and teacher has told you this, and most public restrooms have a goofy sign reminding you to do so, but I know a lot of people first hand that just don't do it. Don't be ashamed, just start washing your hands from now on, and even do it between bathroom breaks (especially before eating or prepping food). As a bonus you will prevent your disgusting bacteria-infested hands from touching things I might encounter. Bitch.  

2. Don't touch your face. Just don't do it. It took me a while to refrain from rubbing my itchy eyes or nose, but I stopped doing it completely.  Do you want the contents of every door knob or handrail you encounter to be deposited into your body? 

3.  Sleep. I've gotten 8 hours of sleep or more almost every single night in the past two years.  I've kept track of people I know who get sick often, and most of them are people who stay up late and sacrifice 8 solid hours of rest.  If it's past midnight and you work at 8 tomorrow, stop reading this shitty, pointless reddit article and go to bed. 

4. DRINK ALCOHOL and have fun on the weekends (or on your days off during the week). I know this sounds like a joke, but I'm 100% serious on this one. Our bodies need a break from the daily stresses and the endless bullshit we encounter at school and work.  Sit back, smoke a joint and crack open a cold one or two.......or eight.  Just avoid sharing drinks with others and get those 8 hours of sleep afterwards :)

5. Eat right and take your vitamins. I've always been a pretty healthy eater, but I stepped up my game the past couple years and began taking a daily multivitamin.  Buying fresh fruits and vegetables requires does more frequent trips to the grocery store, and perhaps some extra prep time. However, buying fresh food is really not more expensive, and there are many associated health benefits. Microwave meals and canned foods are full of preservatives, fat, and mounds upon mounds of sodium. Cut your intake of freezer food  in half and replace it with vegetables, nuts, white meat, and fish. 

6. Open up your windows. I live in Central Coast CA, so we can leave our doors and windows at open during the day all year long (some of you may hate me for this unfair advantage as you look out your window into cold , rainy sorrow. But give me a break, I just moved here little over a year ago from Oregon.  Let me enjoy it).  So, when possible, let some fresh air into your home and office. Breathing warm recycled air saturated with everyone else's exhaled CO2 can't be good. This seems like a great way to for viruses to spread and for bacteria to grow.

medicine,Guess the illness! Symptoms inside. Will update with diagnosis.,"Hi All,

   A patient (27, F, Caucasian, no children) complained of intense stomach pains and went to the clinic. Clinic found leukocytes in urine*, assumed UTI. Patient got sulpha-related medication for UTI. Later culture shows no UTI. Patient has itching of the extremities which proceeds into an entire body rash (hot, itchy). Patient then becomes jaundiced. Blood test shows very high bilirubin count, gets admitted to ER. Patient has ultrasound of the liver, no blockage of bile duct detected. Patient does not engage in high risk activities, however she spent 3 years living in Japan (came home August). 

The tests are still ongoing with her. Blood tests don't indicate an allergic reaction occurring. Both the liver cell levels and liver duct levels are high, but duct levels are slightly higher. Bilirubin has remained steady and elevated for the past four days.

What do you guys think it is? The doctors at the hospital are all disagreeing with each other (internal medicine, auto-immune and allergy specialists are involved so far). If any of you guess it correctly, I'll update the original post with the winner. Brainstorm away!

*previously wrote glucocytes, my apologies.

**EDIT: I am compiling all the answered questions into an edit of the OP for ease.**

-Hep tests are coming back today, I'll let you know.

-Conjugated bilirubin is high 

-urine is dark yellow and foams bright yellow when shaken

-Abdo exam came up with no pain or enlargement of liver

-The rash originally resembled petechiae, then formed raised red plaques on the torso

-PT was born with a poorly functioning kidney causing intense pains that were onset at puberty. 70% of kidney was surgically removed in 2003, PT no longer has pains.

-Family history: PTs father had Sarcoidosis (of the lung), sister is allergic to sulfa

Health,How to submit a good question.,"Typically health professionals use a standard set of questions to resolve a medical presentation. For doctors this can be based on the acronym COPMAPS. If you submit a question try and answer the following:

Chief Complaint: What is your main problem and question? 
(i.e. I have X that I am trying to get rid of or that I'm worried about)

Onset: When did this problem start and how long has it been going on for? (Also, if you know what caused it then that will help as well.)

Progression: Has the pain gotten better or worse? AND On a pain scale of 1 to 10 what would you say it is now?

Mitigating Factors: What makes it better? (Taking aspirin, walking vs. not walking) What makes it worse? (laying down vs sitting up)

Associated Symptoms: What other parts of your body are bothering you?  (Well my chief complaint is a headache but my nose is also running)

Previous Occurrence and Pertinent Other: What is your past medical history? Childhood diseases? Surgeries? Have you or your family experienced this in the past? Lastly: Do you smoke? Drink? or take recreational drugs?

And of course pictures help greatly.

Now, I know this is long but if you submit questions in this format your disease can be narrowed down to a select few, instead of the hundreds that go through our heads when you just say ""I cannot get my headaches to go away."" Hope this helps and happy hunting.",0,6,2012-11-05,PHARMA,0.06365126371383667,0.8955869078636169,0.04076177999377251

Health,Help me figure out what is wrong with my mother.,"I've asked everywhere and I don't know what else to do, so here I am.

*Please keep in mind that she is already getting mental help and it does not seem to do anything. The doctors just prescribe more and different things for her to take to ""solve"" the problem easier. 

*Also, I do help her as much as possible when she is thirsty, hungry, etc. but she seems to fall asleep or drift off while im trying to get her to drink something. I also do not think its just because she is tired that she drifts off, she will sometimes sleep 16+ hours and still doze off as if shes been awake for days. It's almost like this is tranquilizing her.

My mom was hit in the head with a brick when she was 16, she is now 50. (I feel that this is useful information)

She used to be a prescription drug abuser a while ago. Around age 45 she started having seizures and the doctors prescribed her neurontin. Once a month she goes to the doctors and she says that she gets a ""shot"" to help prevent her seizures. This is where it gets weird. She is okay throughout the day, until about 5pm. She starts slowing down, her eyes get all droopy, she cries VERY easily, you can hear how thirsty she is because of how her words come out. She seems very dehydrated and she falls asleep doing everything. While eating, standing up, sitting up, on the phone, drinking water. It's not like a deep sleep or even a ""sleep"" if anything. Her eyes just roll back and she shuts her lids and when I call her name to ""wake"" her she claims shes not sleeping. You can see her eyes slowly roll back to open when this happens. She walks very slowly and hunched over as if shes sad. Everything is just slower and she seems to be very drousy. She can not do anything on her own it seems. Also, i've noticed that her throat seems to get smaller because she has a hard time swallowing anything at all.(Goes with dehydration) I've tried to get her to eat soup over and over but she always wants something with bread, or something you have to chew. It's always bread and chocolate ice cream. (I doubt that has anything to do with it, but its those two specific things that she really wants)
Everything is just so much slower and shes so ""out of it"" so to speak. 

The next morning when she wakes up, she comes in my room crying and says she doesn't remember almost anything or its very very feint from the time that I said above. About 5pm. 
It's like her brain is just shutting down certain parts at a certain time of the day because of this ""shot"" 

Does anybody know what shot this could be doing this to her, or what else is happening? 

I don't think its alzheimer's, but I also don't know much about it. Like I said, it only goes on for a few days and then shes fine the rest of the month until she has to go get the ""shot"" again. 

*She DOES want help and doesn't know where to go or what to do. 

Also, one more question. Would the Doctor be liable for this? She says that he did not tell her any side effects, or what it was called, or even why she gets it. All she knows is that is supposedly helps prevent seizures.",13,13,2012-11-09,PHARMA,0.10012258589267731,0.8738250136375427,0.026052378118038177

Every day (especially afternoon and evening) I feel that I have enormous amounts of energy, I feel happiness without any reason, my friends are asking if I was drinking energy drinks or esspresos cause I can't stop talking, telling stories, expressing myself, my speech very usually becomes very rapid and energetic, when I'm explaining something to someone I do feel very emotionally inspired even ecstatic very often. Even after short sleeping nights (4-5 hours) I usually feel pretty upbeat and enthusiastic for the whole day. Honestly sometimes I do feel more like on drugs than just healthy.

Health,Feeling weak/bad after waking up. Find it hard to get out of bed,"Heyho redditors,

I'm a 21 year old male who is said by his doctor to be as healthy as one could be.

But I think something is wrong: Waking up in the morning seems very hard - independently of how long I've slept.

Showering, drinking water, eating something and airing the room as soon as possible after waking help me to make me feel awake and better. But for me it seems that something is wrong in the first place and I should be more awake after waking up even without having showered, eaten and aired. 

Read that this could be possibly be blood pressure, blood sugar or sleep apnoe related or also be cause by something like a B12 deficiency.

It's believe it's no psychological problem, because I had this getting awake problem for years regardless whether I'm feeling overly happy or bad.

If someone has an suggestion I'd be pleased to know.",22,9,2012-11-10,PHARMA,0.17669743299484253,0.7825610041618347,0.040741585195064545

Health,Help! I've developed an excruciating lump on my ass! (info inside),"I hope that this is the right place for this, and that I can get some help. This is seriously driving me crazy.

I might as well give you some background about myself. I am 12 years old, male, I'm pretty healthy. I am slightly overweight (if that's relevant). I eat a very healthy diet, I avoid fatty, sugary and processed food. I eat lots of fruit and veges and I ensure I consume lots if fibre.  I also wash every day, especially down there.  Normally my metabolism is pretty lousy, once every other day on average. I get a lot of exercise and I go running every other day.   Last week however, I was very constipated for some reason. I took a massive shit on Friday, then I anxiously waited until Tuesday until I finally managed to push a reasonable amount out. I was straining, A LOT. I strained so hard I had a migraine for the rest of the day and a very sore back. I was very puzzled why I was constipated though, I exercise lots and I eat a fuck-ton of fibre, but, oh well. 

Anyway, as the title says, I have a huge lump on my ass, RIGHT next to the actual..... hole, a VERY sensitive area. It is EXTREMELY painful and it impairs me from doing a lot of things. It is very red and large, I don't know how hard it is because its too painful to touch but I think it is very hard. It is the size of a large coin 
and........ sticks up... quite high. It hurts to do ANYTHING, it hurts to stand, to sit, to lie down, to walk even (I have to limp really slowly), to fart, to shit (I have avoided shitting for two days so far due to the immense pain it brings me). It sort of just 'appeared' out of nowhere over the course of Wednesday. By then it just seemed to me like I had some painless boil on my ass that would go away. On Thursday it wasn't very noticeable either, it was painless, only I could feel blood? going to it every now and then. Friday was when it started to hurt, it hurt a little in the morning, but by the afternoon I could bearly stand. I tried to take a photo of it, and from what I managed to see, it was pretty inflamed. I also noticed that there was some blood on 
it, really thick, pale red blood. I cleaned it with some wet toilet paper (which hurt like fuck) then put some anti-bacterial cream on it. That night I had some green tea and managed to get to sleep without painkillers. When I woke up on Saturday, it hurt, but I could relieve it by sitting or lying on my stomach. I can imagine sitting is bad for it though. I was sitting for a big portion of the day. I missed out on Tennis practice, I could hardly move at all. Around about 6pm I put a gauze on it and took 2 painkillers. I went to bed with it on then I took it off around 10. At the moment it is 3 AM. I have had very little sleep, my lump hurts no matter how I lie. I'm just lying here withering around and complaining to myself. I feel like I want to cry. 

I did a Google search yesterday and I narrowed it down to two things I think I might have. I am almost certain it is a blood blister, one that developed while I was straining. It could also be Hemroids,  but it's certainly not likely. However I could relate to all the early symptoms. A lot of the treatments I read for both of these include exercise and pooping. Neither of which I can do without irritating my lump. I just want to speed up the healing process,  so that I can shit, play sports and go to School.

Health,19yr old man chest pain,"So. I am a healthy collegiate cross country runner. This morning, I woke up, ate a little breakfast, and ran an 8k. Afterwards, we went to shower and I felt exhausted. Just super tired and sleepy. Then it began getting hard to breathe and I had short breathes. We went to Chipotle, where in the bathroom, I hyperventilated for about 5min and then it subsided. I then went to the airport to fly out to go home and I again went to the bathroom and started freaking out about my chest again. My chest felt tight and my head felt tingly and my hands went numb and rigid. Some paramedics came and told me to calm down and said I needed to eat (I didn't eat at Chipotle) and that I was dehydrated. I shook it off, got some food and drink, and then got on my airplane to leave about 20min later. Once we got on the plane, I freaked out again on the plane. I used a paper bag and ended up sitting in the back of the plane and had some ice. I calmed down again and made it through the flight. We landed and I took a bus back to campus and on the bus my chest was still tight like it had a cramp. In the last 5minutes I started feeling better. I got off the bus and went to my apartment. I've been here for about 3hours now. I'm not freaking out but I can definitely still feel my chest when I focus on it, but it's not as bad as it was. I've been eating and drinking a lot of fluids as well as taking some ibuprofen. I was also sick last year with a sore throat so that may have something to do with it. Any thoughts or advice and what is going on would be greatly appreciated.
TL;DR I have some chest pain after I ran an 8k and not sure what to do about it.

EDIT: I decided to just try an sleep it off. I got about 10 hours of sleep and I just woke up. From what I can tell right now all the pain is gone and everything seems normal. 

EDIT: Went for a 65min run today. No chest pain, maybe a shortness of breathe. Afterwards I had trouble breathing deeply but that has been subsided. Still no visit to the doctor.

Health,"I have this roommate I find extremely unsettling, but I feel like there might be something wrong with him. does anybody recognize connections within these behaviors?:","* Probably the most creepy thing is how he whispers to himself in front of the mirror for extended periods of time. If I come out of my room he just stares at me through the mirror and goes back to it when I've been out of sight for a few seconds. When it is loud enough for me to hear, it sounds like he is giving an angry speech, in manner similar to the stereotypical high school football coach (lol I hope reddit can conceive that)
* He sometimes sounds like he is singing to himself, which wouldn't be weird if it didn't sound like he was trying to imitate a whale song sung by a whale on helium (I have tried really hard to describe this noise to my friends and this is the best I can come up with sorry). I'm no psychologist but if i had to guess I would maybe think he was experimenting with his vocal cords or something.
* His facial expressions rarely change at all, he almost constantly has a deer caught in the headlights expression on his face
* When I seem him leave the dorm he is always hustling wherever he goes
*  The way he laughs is very inconsistent, sometimes he giggles like a little girl and sometimes he explodes with a babbling guffaw.

I confronted him a couple days ago about the whispering, I said ""hey man you need to stop talking to yourself, its creeping me out and im trying to sleep."" With a blank face, he apologetically replied ""oh, your trying to sleep?"" and that was the end of it. He still goes at it though.

medicine,Potentially safe and effective but unpatentable drugs are being screened out by Big Pharma at the pre-clinical stage. The drug development funding model is broken and it’s costing lives. A simple legislative amendment can solve this issue.,"Did you know that the pharmaceutical industry regularly screens out potentially safe and effective drugs at development stage due to unpatentability? This happens every day behind closed doors and is never publicized. This may sound like a conspiracy theory, but [as this recent paper from a Harvard law professor explains](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1127742), it is not. 

Have any researchers experienced funding issues for a potentially safe and effective medical treatment which is 'unpatentable', 'unprofitable' or 'unmarketable'?

I realised the fundamental problem is not a lack of research, but that the funding model is broken. There are political solutions which can give researchers a chance to get funding to develop cures. I believe in directly raising money for clinical trials by donations/grants, but without a change in the system, a drug will never get the (approximately US$1 billion) funding it needs to get regulatory approval.

A simple solution is to change the law so that major regulatory agencies (e.g. FDA/EMA) can grant 12 years market exclusivity for new drugs (they currently grant only 5 years, which is insufficient). This exclusivity will allow researchers to raise the funding to conduct clinical trials, irrespective of patentability. We should also establish a new medical funding model of using prizes to be paid for successful outcomes in clinical trials, which can be used to incentivise development of 'unprofitable' medical treatments for third world diseases.

We need to fix the broken system, and properly incentivise development of safe and effective treatments by doctors and researchers.  

Hopefully we can get some industry insiders to start talking about this issue, which is costing lives every day. If this gets enough interest, I will establish a charitable organisation to raise public awareness and lobby for change. Would you support this organisation through a crowdfunding campaign? The goal is to reduce reliance on patents for drug development. Big Pharma's only concern is to prevent generic competition, and there are existing market exclusivity mechanisms already in place. All that is required is raising awareness and get political will to support this simple legislative amendment. 

I don't have a lot of faith in Reddit to help publicise or be sympathetic to this issue, but maybe this can get in front of the right people by chance. 

**TL;DR: Unpatentable drugs never get funding for clinical trials. Thousands of drugs are abandoned because of patent issues and the public never finds out. Granting 12 years market exclusivity for new drugs will allow researchers to raise the funding to conduct clinical trials, irrespective of patentability.**

EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes! 

Just to give some more details, there is also a need to allow some kind of exclusivity/priority for the sponsor of the clinical trials, in the absence of patents (because drug companies will be unhappy with relying on trade secret protection for their clinical trial data  - which will be difficult and expensive to enforce). 

A method to accomplish this could be a special clinical trial registration system for otherwise 'public domain' drugs/treatments. The registration of a clinical trial using a treatment protocol (which is published at the same time) would create a ‘priority date’ for that company, whereby the sponsor must start a new clinical trial using the same (or similar) protocol within a certain period of the registration (e.g. 2 years), or they lose that priority date. The drug company which obtains market approval for a drug treatment protocol with the earliest priority date will get the 12 years market exclusivity for that treatment protocol (so it will not be possible for a second company to 'free-ride' on previous clinical trials conducted by the innovator company - unless the innovator delays in conducting new trials). It may be possible to provide that the results of the trial using that protocol must also be published in a peer reviewed journal and also, the sponsor of the original clinical trial has a time limit to achieve regulatory approval (e.g. 8 years), otherwise priority is lost. At the same time, the company could file new patents on any 'surprising' innovations discovered during clinical trials. This system would allow a researcher to register their clinical trial and have a chance of getting private funding, even without a patent.",9,34,2012-11-13,PHARMA,0.026631928514689207,0.8365096747875214,0.1368583794683218

Keep it up, guys! 

I had another idea though...is it possible that I pulled a muscle or something like that during sexual activity? I am rather sexually active with one partner, and was wondering if you could indeed be having too much of a good thing X-D. Just wondering, because I feel like i'd feel some sort of pain or show some urine symptoms SOMEWHERE if it was urinary tract related. Thoughts?

I was thinking of going in for one last check up with the urgent care, maybe check my blood and make sure everything seems normal/in balance, along with just catch their updated opinions. Thoughts?

Also, sometimes can get a dry mouth, but not sure if that's perhaps just related to dehydrating myself from peeing so much.

Hi there Reddit! 

Just looking for some advice/suggestions as what to look for next based on my title, seeing as I have no dedicated doctor and no proper insurance. I am 24/M, no health problems ever until now. 

I have had some overall minor UTI-like symptoms, mostly limited to a frequent need to urinate, which varies in urgency and frequency (anywhere from 2-5 hr windows, wakes me up at night). It comes with a light tingling sensation in my pelvic region. No pain, though. The groin area feels a little tender overall, and there is a slight tenderness to my testicles. **EDIT 1** Tenderness/sensitivity in the testes increases when laying on my stomach. Standing generally reduces my need to urinate over an extended period of time (not a relief from feelings when i get them, just lowers my frequency in general). **\end EDIT 1**

I have been feeling most of these symptoms since 10/25...testicle tenderness has more so developed over the past week. I originally was prescribed Doxycycline Hyclate (100mg dosages 2x a day for a week), even though urine tests for UTI-related bacterias came up negative, as an at-home test i took suggested my Leukocytes levels indicated a potential infection. 

The medication seemed to have helped, but symptoms re-emerged a few days after I finished it off, and so I went back and had further testing for syphilis/gonorrhea AND bacteria related to UTI's again, only to all come up negative as of yesterday. I am currently finishing a second prescribed week-long dose of the Doxycycline Hyclate, which ends in a couple days. 

So, what could this be? I am not experiencing any other really tell-tale signs of anything, and I'd hate to just let it sit to and observe more symptoms, even if it may help pinpoint the issue. What would any of your recommendations be? Anyone else experienced these issues?


**EDIT 1** Because this is probably useful, my diet is moderately healthy by most standards consists of a lot of dairy in general (fat free milk, cheeses), eggs, peanut butter, almonds, chicken, fruits, homemade veggie soups, salads, the occasional microwave burrito (hahaha), and ~6oz coffee 3-4 times a week, cream only . I very, very rarely drink soda, and I occasionally have a small glass of wine every couple nights (~4 oz). I drink some teas as well (green, black). I drink a decent amount of water at work because I talk and run around all day. **\end EDIT 1**",15,22,2012-11-14,PHARMA,0.07736065983772278,0.8904352784156799,0.032204072922468185

 Before you go off and think I'm some gross dirty shitkid let me tell you that I am VERY VERY hygienic. I shower every night before I go to bed, before I go to work in the afternoons, and I always shower after I have a bowel movement. I use normal soap and I always make sure my area is clean and properly dried after showering. Laundry is done once a week, fresh clothes are a must.

Back to my poop... It's rarely solid and sometimes I don't go everyday. Back to my diet, I drink a lot of water and eat fiber cereal for breakfast in the morning so I don't understand why I can't go sometimes.

Health,"r/health, can you help? Flatulence is ruining my life...","Apologies for the wall of text and unpleasant subject matter... I realise this isn't a forum for medical advice - I have been thorougly examined by several doctors already and I'm only looking for anecdotal evidence...

So, I know farting is a hilarious and sometimes embarrasing normal occurence for most people, but it's really the worst thing about my life. I'm a 24 year old guy and for the last 3 years or so, I've been passing wind a lot, and it smells awful. A really stroung, sulfurous, clinging smell. It always smells the same. My room has a nasty smell all the time, and it's got to the stage where I'm really worried about having someone over or staying at someone's house. The smell is terrible all the time, but I don't really fart much during the day, it's mostly in the evenings and at night.

I seem to have periods where it gets a bit better for a few weeks, then goes back to normal.

It doesn't seem to matter what I eat all, though drinking beer seems to make it twice as bad as usual. At about the same time this started, I started getting a localised pain directly below my right ribcage, pretty much where the gallbladder is. This pain is pretty much constant, but varies in intensity and doesn't seem to be related to food or stress. I've pestered doctors for the last 2 years, but they've all told me it's ""just IBS"" and told me there's nothing they can do. I've had blood tests for liver function, ultrasound scans to look for gallstones, celiac test, a barium swallow, ECG, chest X-ray, bacterial overgrowth breath test and stool test for parasites.

However, I don't really believe it's IBS - I don't really have either diareah or constipation (though tend towards constipation, if anything) and the pain is very localised - it feels like a large marble is stuck under my ribcage, not the cramping or bloating pain that I've heard IBS described as. I've tried every IBS drug going - peppermint, mebeverine, hycosine, alverine, tricyclic antidepressants etc, but none has had the slightest effect on the pain or the gas at all.

Supplements I've tried:

Fybogel (no difference to pain, made gas smell worse)
Charcoal (doesn't really do anything)
Digestive Enzymes (ditto)
Probiotics (ditto).

I've tried cutting out dairy and gluten and tried a paleo diet for a couple of months, but nothing made any difference. 

I was hoping someone has had a similar problem and has worked out what was causing it, or at least how to deal with the symptoms. My theory is that there's some problem with my gallbladder which isn't caused by gallstones, but which is preventing it from releasing bile properly. The fats in my diet aren't being broken down and are being digested by the bacteria in my gut, hence the horrible smell. I would like to have a HIDA scan done to test this, but the doctors I've mentioned it to said that it's a very rare procedure that they wouldn't usually consider. Does this sound reasonable? If it was a gallbladder problem, would having it removed be likely to fix the gas problem to some extent? I'm considering paying for a private consultant and specifically requesting this test.",23,16,2012-11-16,PHARMA,0.25455614924430847,0.719609797000885,0.025834016501903534

I'm currently a P1 student and I'm very interested in doing a psychiatric pharmacy specialization after graduation. I found nearby hospitals that offer residency programs for this specialization on the CPNP.org site; would it be appropriate to request information from these places on possibly doing some kind of summer internship to get an idea of what the job is like? Or is it too niche for them to have opportunities like that?

I would like to know what kind of pharmacist I want to shoot for before I head off to college next year. I currently have a pharm tech internship in a retail pharmacy and while I like it a lot, I don't think retail is for me in the long run. My questions on hospital are:

1. Do you have to deal with people as much?

2. Do you have higher ups breathing down your neck like the big chains do? 

3. Do you use more of what you went to school for? 

4. Is there extra schooling needed? 

5. What are the main responsibilities?

Health,"My doctors have no idea what is wrong with me, so now they are desperate (as am I). I am being sent to the Cleveland Health Clinic. any ideas as to what is wrong with me? Any comments about the Cleveland Clinic? Good? Bad?","Background: For the past three weeks, (Going on 4 this next monday) I have been having severe chest pain, beginning in my sternum and it spiderwebs left into my side and shoulder. (It is a constant pain, hovering in the 4-6 pain scale of 1-10) I have nausea, headache, extreme fatigue, my heart rate has not dropped below 100 in three weeks (even while sleeping) . Basically, my body thinks it is having a heart attack. I have all of the symptoms, except for the fact my heart is fine. THere is nothing wrong with it. It is anatomically correct, it pumps blood fine, the walls are the right thickness. The only strange things are I have palpitations, and my heart rate is high. The pain is constant, staying mainly around a 5, and then I have these 'attacks' of high pain spiking up to 9, or even 9.5. I have been on an array of medications, been to the er twice, had tests run. Chest ct with contrast, head ct, chest xray. I've had over 30 vials of blood taken, and multiple tests run on those. My white blood cell count is fine, my enzymes, thyroid, ect, ect. The only thing that came back a little off was my blood was more coagulable, so more prone to clots, so they ran the chest ct. I've seen multiple doctors, multiple specialists, and at this point they are spinning their wheels. I was taking 500 of vicodin, then 750 4xa day, and that barely touched the pain,, so now i'm on 7.5 of oxycodon, and it helps more than the vicodin, but the pain is still there. I'm on celebrex, a beta blocker to bring down my heart rate, and skelaxin. No one knows what to do, and I haven't been able to attend classes or work for three weeks. I am desperate, and at the end of my rope.
So, I am going to try to get into the Cleveland clinic to see if they can do... something? anything! Does anyone know anything about them? Are they good? anyone have any idea what the fuck is wrong with me? any ideas? Message me and let me know if you have an idea. It isn't a torn muscle, an inflamed rib/sternum joint, or spasming esophagus.
I didn't know where else to post this, so just let me know and I can move it. anyway, thanks for reading, and let me know if anyone has any ideas what this could be, if the Cleveland clinic is a good place to go, or what you think...... thanks.

EDIT: I went, and They have no idea what is wrong with me. They had/have no diagnosis, and I'm still in quite a lot of pain. They ordered a lot of tests, but they didn't really take me seriously, and I was only there for 2 days, seeing 2 doctors, and then they told me that my last visit was ""my exit visit"". I can't say I am really impressed. they didn't really do anything. Quite a disappointment. And still, no one has any idea what is wrong with me.",6,8,2012-11-18,PHARMA,0.14268362522125244,0.8292586207389832,0.02805773727595806

medicine,EM Doc here. Need medica/legal advice. I think a death of a friend could have been prevented,"FYI- I originally posted this in r/legal. So, this is mostly in lay terms.
So, first off. I am an Emergency Medicine Physician. So, I know the medicine aspect of it, and I am pretty sure there was gross negligence. Here's the story. This friend of mine is my MIL's best friend, has been like a mother to my wife through her whole life (and for a couple years of mine now). The story:  Relevant past medical history- A doctor incidentally found a cyst in her ventricle 4 years ago. She was followed by a neurosurgeon for 2 years w/ serial head CTs every 6 months to follow this cyst.  In 2 years there was no change in the cyst. So, the NS advised them that they probably did not need to follow-up every 6 months if they didn't want to. However, if she ever had really bad headaches with intractable nausea/vomiting, she needed to seek medical attention.
For the past month (or two), she's been having terrible headaches. The first one happened a 2 months ago. She thought this was a migraine (however, no history of migraines before this), with this migraine she had 1 episode of nausea/vomiting. A month passed, and she began to have some dizziness and headaches. She was seen by a doc who told her she had vertigo (this was a month ago). She then had severe headaches on and off for a month culminating to 2 days ago. She woke up with an awful headache, not made better with anything (vicodin/tramadol/rest). She developed intractable nausea/vomiting. At this point, she called her neurosurgeon and left a message (didn't call back).  After not hearing back for a couple of hours, they went to the ED down the street. There, she was seen by an EM doc, who called and reached the neurosurgeon who said ""she could schedule an outpatient MRI"". She did not get a CT. She was given IV morphine and told to go home and rest.
    The next morning, her husband tried to wake her up and she was acting lethargic and said she couldnt get out of bed. So, he let her sleep another 30 mins to an hour, and went to go check on her. At this time she was found unresponsive and not breathing. EMS was called. She was taken to the hospital and a CT revealed that she had herniated secondary to hydrocephalus from the cyst blocking her villi (CSF drainage). aka brain dead
I feel as a physician, this was gross negligence and failure to diagnose. She had all the symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, and they were written off.
 So, reddit, what are my options? How to I go about this? What role can I serve in helping the family?

Update #1: The autopsy was done today. The results showed that she did have a medium to large colloid cyst obstructing her CSF outflow tract causing moderate to severe hydrocephalus. However, what they actually think caused the death was a Arterio-Venous malformation near her caudate nucleus. They think this started to ""leak"" on the night they presented to the ED, got progressively worse, and finally ruptured when they called EMS.",50,44,2012-11-19,PHARMA,0.12666527926921844,0.8467455506324768,0.026589149609208107

medicine,Scenes from the Emergency Department/My Personal Life: Follow up with your primary care in the morning,"Today's patient is a very interesting one indeed; me. Believe you me, I'm pretty damn interesting, to say the least.

For a few months now, I've been experiencing some neck and shoulder pain, which I simply shrugged off as a repetitive stress injury from sitting at the computer or maybe a muscle strain from rolling a heavy patient off a backboard. The other week the pain suddenly went from mild-moderate to moderately severe. It made it difficult to sleep, it would wake me from sleep, I just couldn't find any position that provided relief. I again assumed that it was a bad strain, and my refusal to baby it like I should have resulted in me aggravating it, so I took 5 days of Robaxin, did some stretching, and bought a heated neck wrap. No relief.

I finally caved and made an appointment with my internist. We sat down, I explained my assumed mechanism of injury, my failed attempts at self medicating, the standard OPQRST mnemonic, etc. I also explained that I'd checked for Phalen's signs to R/O carpal tunnel causing the radiation, noted a positive Sulcus sign, couldn't palpate any trigger points or AC separation, and did the various range of motion checks you'd do with a patient who presented with a shoulder injury.

His solution: work backwards. Coming from the ED, my mind automatically thought traumatic injury, something acute and most likely musculoskelatal, so I worked up achy 4th finger to my sore trapezius. Coming from primary care, his first instinct was to instead look for something chronic, not traumatic but medical. He checked the range of motion in my neck and noted what was most painful, then palpated each cervical vertebrae. There it was. My perceived musculoskelatal issue was neurological, and the Sulcus sign was just incidental. He pressed on a spinous process, and along with a pop came searing pain in my shoulder that radiated to my last two fingers, a prescription for Vicodin, and a trip to radiology.

**Lessons learned**:

* When we discharge a patient from the ED and tell them to follow up with a specialist/PCP, they really really should.

* Correlation is not causation. A busy shift with lots of lifting patients resulting in increased pain does not mean the source of the pain is the use of the shoulder.

* They're head to toe exams, not toe to head/point tenderness, whichever comes first.

* The ER is not staffed by orthopods, gastros, cardiologists, derms, rads or any other specialty outside of EM and FM. Ortho, gastro, cardiology, dermatology, and radiology are not our specialties and we'll often miss something if we pretend it is.

* When in doubt, refer to specialist.

* When certain, refer to specialist.

* You still can't convince me to take oral steroids ever again. I'd probably wind up with less heartburn after drinking the contents of a car battery.",5,22,2012-11-20,PHARMA,0.15692414343357086,0.8141776323318481,0.02889827825129032

medicine,Dealing with septic IV drug users on the ward as a junior Doctor (intern),"Any senior Doc's have any advice on how to deal with a septic IVDU (Heroine) on the ward?

How do you guys rate an honest approach?

For example:

""It is the teams believe that you need for Opiate drug, whilst partially due to real pain, it is also due to psychosocial issues and addiction/withdrawal.""

""We will not let you out of the hospital with a PICC as we belief that you will continue to inject H - which is introducing further pathogens/junk into your body and putting you at risk and making our treatment ineffective.""

""We are not doing investigation X because even if it shows condition Y you are not a candidate for treatment due to your continued IVDU.""

And then when they repeatedly try to go off the ward with a myriad of excuses - 

""We cannot let you off the ward with the PICC, if you leave the ward we will remove the PICC and we will/cannot put another one in. If that happens you can no longer receive IV abs and we think it is highly likely you will develops an overwhelming infection and their is a very real chance that you will die.""



The issues with this approach are - 

Patient my get angry/aggresive
I can't make the call to make the decision to to pull the PICC - and sometimes senior colleagues aren't prepared to make that call/we are required to get input from multiple departments which takes a long time.
Is the patient competent enough to understand the repercussions of their actions/decisions.


so any Senior Docs use this approach? How does it work? Had someone shot up into their PICC/CVL and die - what happened?

In my limited experience my Seniors have held some information from patients in an effort to avoid provocation - e.g. expected length of stay, why they are not receiving investigations - and they may sugar coat why someone is not to leave the ward with the PICC insitu e.g. you are very sick and we need to keep an eye on you?

I'd appreciate any advice you guys have

At the moment I'm thinking the best approach is to be honest and hound your seniors for a plan of action for when the inevitable threats to self discharge begin.

Thanks for bearing with wall of text.

Health,Worried about my mother. What can someone with neurological or brain tumor experience tell me?,"My mother who is in her mid 40's called me this morning to drop some new developments in her life. She possibly has a brain tumor, or some other neurological disorder.

 I immediately drop what I doing to drive an hour to see her in person, I am a grad student. My heart breaks and all I can do is stand there telling  her to do what she has to. I tell her I will do all I can to be there, so she is not alone. Its the most I can do for the woman who loved me and let me go so I could pursue a college degree. 

I left home in hopes of making it to a stable life for her and myself. Through gaining a higher education. Its been a long hard road and I have yet to help my mother all that I want to. 

Life has been so cruel to her for so long. My father  left us while I was still in high school. Left and divorced my mother, for another woman leaving heavy debt and no remorse. My mother never got to go to college.

She still works at a low paying job. Years down the road the house is under foreclosure. My mother stressed and over worked. 

Now added to the stress is the possibility of a brain tumor ,or something else. She has a dilated pupil, pain, headaches, weight loss, poor sleep, and when she tries to bring her fingers together..her pinkies automatically separate. There are a few other symptoms, and she is going in for tests that she cannot afford.

 What can I do for my mother? I sit here in tears wondering what I can do, who can I turn to? I work part time and go to school full time, I am stressed by that alone , and on the inside I am a wreck wanting my mother to be ok. I sat with her today and cried and told her how much she means to me. We spent the day together. It was simple and wonderful. 

I want to help her through this financially as well as emotionally. The emotional support is in no question, yet how to I find aid for her?

medicine,thoughts on doctors having tattoos?,"So I'm only a medical student at the moment but I wanted some views from the medical community (who are not involved in my education - besides i haven't seen any consultants or even juniors with visible tattoos yet). I have, for a long time, wanted a tattoo but never been sure what to get so it's always been in the back of my head. During summer I decided to seriously think about getting one, and I'm still not sure of designs or locations for the reason in the title.

So how appropriate is it for doctors to have tattoos these days? Especially in locations where it may be visible by patients/staff. I was thinking of something small on the inside of my wrist, thinking it could be covered by a watch easily, but then I remembered that docs can't wear watches on the ward for infection control reasons (same as the no tie thing). But even if I were to get it in that location, is it still looked down upon? I suppose in interviews it can/will be covered by a watch, but I also don't want to get it and then realise I've made a mistake. 

I know this varies depending on location so ideally I'd like some more UK/NHS viewpoints, but everyone is welcome to comment.",43,11,2012-11-22,PHARMA,0.02455654926598072,0.9214895963668823,0.053953900933265686

My brother the past month has been telling me about how he believes everyone at work is conspiring against him to get him fired. How there's so many signs that connect. He's been on a gambling/smoking cigarettes binge out of nowhere to. (We live in Nevada so gambling is easily accessible) A few days ago when he was at the casino he said someone put down a business card and he knew it was for him but didn't touch it. And they were everywhere at the casino and came to the conclusion they were trying to hire him. This morning he woke me up saying he found this plastic thing in the dish washer and when he googled it, it was for testing on rats. And went about locking my windows and unplugging everything. Telling me all these weird signs and how if anyone shows up to call him at work. To not use any of the appliances or even shower. Soon after he leaves he comes back. He instantly walks in and asks who else is in the house. He tells me to go stay at where he works and soon changes his mind to just drop him off. (He's borrowing my car since his is in the shop until next week) While doing this he won't let me where my hat telling me he doesn't trust me with it on. So I drive him to work and on the way he says he doesn't know why but he's tripping and he knows something is going on. He then says I can use the appliances when I get back.

Health,I feel like I'm crazy and I don't know what to do with myself anymore.,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to be doing this but I don't know what else to do. I'm 18 years old, I'm a female, and something is very wrong with me but I don't know what it is and I don't know where to start.

I have high anxiety (I have not been diagnosed with any anxiety disorders, however). I put off going to the doctor because I'm worried about what I'd find out but I am 100% sure that I have some sort of anxiety disorder but a lot of the things I do seem out of place for any anxiety disorder I've researched and I need a bit of insight.

I have severe panic attacks (I think they are panic attacks) when I am fighting with family or friends. I shake extremely badly and become freezing cold and nauseous and if I'm not wrapped in blankets I throw up. I get light-headed during these episodes and my legs give out if I try to walk because my knees buckle so badly. I have trouble taking deep breaths when this happens as well and this causes me to panic more. These last about 10-15 minutes depending on the severity of the fight. 

Aside from the episodes, I also have nervous ticks I guess you could say. When I am sitting or laying down, I find myself very restless. My foot is always bouncing or my toes are always moving. If they aren't, I feel very uncomfortable. I pull out my eyelashes when I am wearing mascara and once I start I cannot stop and I must finish both eyes. If something prevents me from finishing or I try to stop myself, I get extremely upset and on the verge of tears before I go back to it again. I bite my nails and pick at them, too, as well as my toe nails. I do this obsessively and it has resulted into chronic ingrown toenails and I've since had surgery to correct this. When I have scabs, I must pick them. If I don't, I'll stare at them and not focus on anything else until I give in and pick it. If I am wearing nail polish and one nail chips, I chip every other nail until all of the nail polish is off. If I don't, like the scabs, I will stare until I give in. 

I tell my parents and friends what I go through but they all coin it as typical nervous habits but I know what a nervous habit is and those aren't it. My friends will try to stop me if they see me biting my nails or picking my eyelashes and when I tell them I can't stop they roll their eyes at me and let it go. No one understands and that causes me even more stress and anxiety.

Has anyone gone through something similar? Can anyone point me in the right direction maybe so I can bring it all to a doctor and see what they have to say? I'm so sick of living like this...I would love personal experiences from you to know that I am not alone and that I am not crazy. 

Again I apologize if this is in the wrong place or if I did anything wrong. Just give me a heads up and a budge in the right direction and I'll fix everything immediately.

EDIT: I also forgot to mention that I have extreme paranoia that keeps me up at night. It does not focus on one particular thing; sometimes it could be I am worried about the oven being off or sometimes it's me checking out at a cash register and leaving thinking that the cashier is thinking bad thoughts about me. It's all immature, annoying stuff that I hate worrying about.

**EDIT 2:** Thank you all for your advice. I guess it was silly of me to not immediately go to a doctor but I was scared of what I'd find out. Now that I see most of you understand what I mean, it makes me feel a bit at ease. I don't know about my insurance covering CBT or what CBT even consists of but I will take the first step to figure all of it out on my own. Thank you all so much. Maybe you all don't think you offered that much help but you did and I'm super grateful. Thank you.",10,18,2012-11-25,PHARMA,0.18128244578838348,0.794715940952301,0.02400166727602482
