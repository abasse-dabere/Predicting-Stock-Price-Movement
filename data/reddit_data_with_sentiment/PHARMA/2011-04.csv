medicine,To all the Health Professionals on Meddit,"Hopefully you guys can help me out, I'm currently working on a project for one of my classes.  One part requires me to have at least 4 interviews for people working in the medical field.  I've gotten a couple, but I live in a small town, there's not much diversity here.  So I figured there has bound to be quite a different array of health professionals on Meddit.  So here I am hoping you guys can give time to answer a few questions.

-Describe you education, how tough was it? (Also how many years did it take, and the typical starting salary)
-What are your typical duties for your career?
-How many hours a week do you have to work?
-How long did it take you to find a job after school?( Was it difficult, what are the different work environments you can work in)
-What would you say is the best and worst part of you career?

Here's some tougher ones:

-Out of all the career paths, why medicine?
-Do you have any regrets for choosing this career?
-If you hadn't chosen medicine what would you be doing?
-What are some common skills you think one needs for your career?

Health,Developing a seabacious cyst on upper back. Anything to help it out?,"I've had 2 before in the same general area, and have had them taken care of. However, I generally waited until it really started hurting.

This particular one isn't too painful, it's just itchy. It's a little red, but it's hard to tell because it's in the same spot as last time. It hasn't really gotten overly bumpy or ya know, obviously infected.

I'm gonna give it a few days. Even when my shit was infected last year at this time, it was obvious, but I still had to take 3 days to just give it constant wet heat so it would liquefy.

Should I put lotion on it?

I'm also thinking it just might be couch burn because I have skimped on exercising. I think once I go for a hike or something, it might work itself out.

I'm always overly paranoid about that part of my back anyway.

So can anyone with professional background comment on this ?

It turns out pills are indeed  not digested at all, and fill our sewages by thousands of pounds. Amazon sells lots of pill crushers (i am going to buy one). They help with absorption rates.

Health,"Doctors of Reddit, I'm worried about my girlfriend.","She has been admitted to a hospital (I'm outside the US) on Friday (5 days ago). She had some stomach ache and since then she's on a drip and not allowed to drink or eat (anything including water). There is still no diagnosis but the doctors say its either vermiform appendix or a kidney stone. I know that these two are hard to differ based on symptoms, but 5 days without drinking? 5 days without a diagnosis? I'm afraid that this is not the end because they did no examinations today. 
I usually trust all kind of specialists, because they certainly know more than me in their field. The reason I'm worried this time is that this is a public hospital and in my country the NHS pays hospitals on the patient/day basis. The longer she's there (and she's not a big cost), the more money the hospital earns). I sort of understand this kind of actions because if not for them there would be no money for any operations by the end of the year in the hospital. Now, to the point: the question is- is it safe to be a 5 or 7 days on a drip, not drinking or eating anything without any diagnosis? She has lost some weight by now and is very weak (which is why I made this post)
Thank you in advance for your answers. 
Cheers :).
  
Edit: thank you for your answers, I'll try to respond in few hours. Today they allowed her to drink and eat yogurt and cream cheese. She feels much better because of that. To all those writing about hospitalization costs: it's in Poland. The Hospitals have contracts with our version of ""NHS"" (or not really as it is a fund), and receive funds based on these contracts. Just some funny facts:

* The hospital gets no money if they discharge a patient within 3 days (seriously...)
* After three days, the ""NHS"" pays for every day. 
* At the end of every year hospitals are short of money for basic operation.

Genital/groin pain, full body itchiness","For about 6 months or more now I have been experiencing random itchiness all over my body including genitals, scalp, really everywhere.. You name it. this appeared out of nowhere. It is with me on a daily basis though some days definitely more noticeable than others. There are no rashes, bumps or anything at all. 

I have random pain in my testicles, penis, bottom of my feet and inner thighs. I have gone to a urologist for many visits and they can't come up with anything. I even had a bladder scope and he found nothing and no inflammation of the urethra, etc. I keep thinking i have herpes somehow but I have never experienced any blisters anywhere on my body in the time I have had these issues, and from what I know, itchiness from that is not something that stays with you ever day. I had full blood work and STD scan done months back as well that came back negative. 

I do have lumbar disc herniations and I was informed that sometimes this can cause groin pain. Due to the fact that i do sometimes notice when i workout at the gym some things I do cause ever so slight pain down there, I'm starting to think it really might be the discs causing the issues after all, but the thing is that this itchiness started around the same time and I can't help but think they're connected. I brought all of these issues up to the doc and he just said try an antihistamine for the itch, or maybe its the cold dry weather, etc. 

I'm just kind of getting depressed and I notice myself sleeping more and more because to be honest it's like living in this body anymore and putting up with these unknown issues is becoming a hassle; like the less time i spend awake in this body the better. It also sucks finally getting motivation to finally take the time to go to the docs and get the problem checked out and being seemingly dismissed.

Health,Anyone have experience with Wellbutrin?,"My doctor warned me that the first week was going to be really rough... irritability and depression are going to sky rocket.

It's been 5 days and this is getting fucking ridiculous.  I have absolutely NO control over my temper and little things send me into a rampage.  My bf has been so understanding, and forgiving me instantly, which, in fact, makes me feel worse because I feel like I owe him but can't look past my stresses to figure out anything more than a blow job and good sex (which doesn't solve everything, you know, lol).

I just want to get some reassurance that this is probably going to ease up... cuz I'm making myself and those I love miserable.

Edit: For those who experience depression, I want to tell you a trick that has helped during those times where fantasizing about hurting myself or ending things has popped in.  I've dealt with severe depression for about 10yrs now, attempted to end things when it first started.  After therapy, puberty, and taking control of my life, I live by one though: ""I want to know what happens next.""  And I have a few goals I keep that I have to accomplish before I die... get married, have a dog, pet a lemur, etc.  Basically, I made a list of things that make me happy that I want to do, and I cling to the thought of doing it to stay alive.  Things may royally fucking suck for me right now... but I want to see what happens next :)

EDIT: New occurences are going on, and I think I've figured out why.  Before I started Wellbutrin, I was on a OTC diet pill regimine, something I didn't want to tell my Dr about because he'd yell at me, lol.  I thought there might be some issues, did not expect them to be this bad.  As of today, I've begun having physical problems... strabismus, shakey, sweats, along with all the mental stuff.  The last time I took a diet pill was last night, and I don't plan on continuing them.  Also, I will not be drinking any sort of caffeine until things level out.  Fuck, I even had to call my boss today and tell him I needed to do something about work (having random outbursts of screaming doesn't work when you are involved with customer service).

I will let you know what happens, if things get better, or if I have to switch.  Im giving it a week.

UPDATE: Well, the intense ARGH GRRR KILL!! moods have died off and I'm more normal (yay).  But that first week was... deathly.  If my boyfriend hadn't been warned before hand, Im sure he would have left me.  I was very lucky to have him through this, I felt like Justin Timberlake in Black Snake Moan a couple of times.  About halfway through that week I started experiencing extreme nausea.  After 5 days of wanting to ralph, I called the Dr... found out that that is, in fact, normal, and can last anywhere from **2-4 WEEKS**.  At that point, I considered getting off of it because the nausea was causing anxiety attacks.  Well, it's about a week and a half into it, and while the dizziness is not completely gone and I'm still fairly irritable, I have no desire to scream at people anymore or vomit :)  So, it's getting better.  My dr called me back today and suggested I wait one more week just to make sure before I decide if I want to switch drugs or not. So, Im going to wait that week since things are getting better.

UPDATE: 2nd month into it... and I'm a horny bastard, lol!  I feel great, my motivation is back, I'm sleeping less, my head has calmed down IMMENSELY to a point where I can handle things step by step, I feel strong enough to be a support system for my love, and my sex drive has peaked to a point where my SO and I have had very insane, crazy sex 6x out of the last 8 days (and only because I was away those 2 days).  I still get nauseous almost every time I smoke (which is probably why it is a quit smoking drug).  But other than that, I couldn't be happier with the drug my Doc chose for me :)  Im just so glad that first few weeks is DONE.",17,7,2011-04-07,PHARMA,0.2342686802148819,0.7406888604164124,0.025042500346899033

Why did you continue to work the code on scene for 30 minutes without contacting medical control to call it? Why did you tell us she took Vicodin, but your run sheet doesn't say you pushed any Narcan? Why did I have spend the last 3 hours of my day with the remnants of a blood stain all down my leg because at no point during your seemingly useless attempt at pretty much doing nothing but sit in the back of the ambulance while an AutoPulse and a vent did your job for you, you didn't cut off her clothes to find and then warn us about the liter of bright red blood she had pouring from her rectum?

I know your name, I know what station you're out of, I know your Chief, and being that he's also the director of Emergency Medicine, I know your medical director. However, I'm not going to do anything with that info, because I'm hoping that the dirty looks that every nurse working the floor that day gave you as they did everything you should have already done already, the talking down you got from the attending as he intubated that ""difficult airway"" of your's in no time flat, and me telling you to ""read that bright fucking yellow book they gave you that tells you exactly how to do your fucking job"", gets you to suck just a little less the next time.

But in regards to facial hair in the operating room, I think the arguments about additional precautions seem to be hand-waving: there is dense hair on everyone's face and the most germ-laden parts of the hair will be near the follicle, not on the shaft. I did a little research. 

I have found [one article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2044.2000.055002173.x/full) showing an increase in bacteria shed from beneath the masks of bearded men and to a lesser extent women when compared to clean-shorn men. This is crap because it does not look at evidence beyond a petri dish and is prone to sample bias because it is small and non-randomized (obviously more data and more clinically relevant data).

But then I found that is no indication that wearing a mask benefits the patient [per a study 19 years ago.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1853618) In fact some other data speaks to the contrary.

Health,20yo woman with serious hair loss issues (Xposted from r/2xchromosomes),"20 yo female here, throwaway account.

For about a year now, my hair has been falling out, as well as breaking off. I used to have extremely thick, long curly brown hair. I probably have about 1/3rd of the hair I once did, and still losing. I'm losing strands all over, not in patchy, specific areas. This is so emotionally devastating- my confidence has been destroyed.

I've seen other posts on reddit with a similar complaint and the consensus was to see a doctor. I've seen about 7 doctors and 2 dermatologists. All of them have basically told me that since my bloodwork is fine, nothing can really be done for me. I don't feel like anyone I've spoken to has seemed like they were actually invested in trying to investigate the problem.

The only other symptom that is worth mentioning is that I seem to react very badly to eating larger amounts of food, especially sugar- I sometimes have heart palpitations, and generally feel really weird, almost high afterwards. I have mentioned this to every doctor, and they mostly just shrug and say it's unrelated. I'm not overweight- about 125 lbs at 5'6.

If the gods of Reddit can think of ANYTHING that these totally unsympathetic doctors haven't, I will be eternally grateful.

Health,Is my vacation over?,"A bit of background – I’m 19 and lived in Upstate New York for most of my teenage years. I went to Edinburgh after high school, and only recently came back to visit my friends for Spring Break. 

About two weeks ago, I noticed swelling in both my hands and my feet, typically in the morning when I got up. I thought nothing of it the first time, but it kept happening and gradually resulted in Hives. I assumed I was reacting in the same way as my sister did to grass and visited another friend.

Soon, I began breaking out spontaneously whenever I went outside. Up and down my arms and legs, usually wherever the air touched my skin. I assumed there was either a correlation between the air and my breaking into Hives, probably due to an unknown reaction to pollen. This was further reinforced by being fine in NYC during a sudden rain, but having the entirety of my arms covered in itchy Hives the day after (my friend told me that pollen is released more in days after a rain).

I started taking Benadryl for the problem, typically taking about 30 minutes to react. This has worked until I’ve come to Mexico. Down here, I occasionally break into hives (nothing like up north) until I touch the ocean water. The entirety of my skin broke onto into horrendous hives, large swells that concerned my father enough to take me to the doctor.

The doctor insisted that my reaction was the result of “Medusa” – as far as I’m aware, she was talking about jellyfish. However, I was on a jet ski and had no immersed contact with the water apart from what splashed onto my body. The front of my body was more severely affected than the back. Regardless, I received a shot in my butt to treat the jellyfish sting, and received a prescription for elica (some sort of cream to reduce itchiness) and allegra for the allegry symptoms. 

However, on the medication, I’m not allowed to swim, drink, or go into the sun, effectively ending my entire vacation. I have the medication in front of me, but I want /r/health’s opinion on if I should take the stuff. 

A final point to make is that the doctor said she was surprised at how long it was taking for the hives to go away after I received the shot, but I had already taken a Benadryl and it was about 30 minutes (aka when it begins to take effect). 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve never had anything like this before, but my sister breaks into Hives when she comes in contact with grass and my uncle is severely allergic to things like bees. Should I take the medicine and risk ruining the rest of my vacation, or not take it and risk medical complications?",1,2,2011-04-21,PHARMA,0.09503047168254852,0.8791249990463257,0.02584456279873848

Health,Food intolerances give me migraines.  Doctors are no help.,"Over the past few years I've discovered a number of foods that make me extremely fatigued and cause migraines.  I get this burning sensation behind my eyes and just want to sleep, usually followed by headaches.  The foods include:  wheat (maybe other grains), Zantec, and now apparently grass-fed ground beef.  The last 2 weeks I've had constant migraines and the only notable difference in diet was the beef, so I stopped for a couple of days and finally feel normal.  There are no digestional issues with any of these foods as far as pain or gas.  In the early 2000's I ate whatever I wanted with no problems at all.

Doctors look at me like I'm making it all up.  Earlier this year I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy.  That was $4500 for them to diagnose me with GERD (already knew that) and test negative for celiac disease.

Health,Auditory hallucinations that prevent sleep,"Hi Reddit,

I need help. I haven't been able to go to bed without the help of drugs or alcohol since October. Whenever I lie down, and try to drift off to sleep, I am startled suddenly by some sort of noise. Sometimes it's someone saying ""Hey,"" sometimes it's the sound of a weight dropping at a gym, sometimes it's just a buzzing noise. I do not have these sensations at any other time besides when I try to sleep.

There have been a couple of instances where I've felt someone pat me on the back, and another time when I felt a ""vibrate"" like a phone vibrate through my whole body. 

I have seen my doctor and a sleep specialist without any luck. I am going to see a psychiatrist next week. Does anyone have a suggestion? Right now I am getting .5 mg of Klonopin, and I also take 5mg of Melatonin and 200 mg of 5-HTP to get to sleep. My symptoms are getting worse and worse though, and I am very afraid that something is very wrong.

[tl;dwatch](http://www.acupuncturebrooklyn.com/uncategorized/fructose-sugar-poison-and-obesity)

[edit] while the doc talk about fructose in his lecture, i'm pretty sure most of the emphasis is on high fructose corn syrup that's in junk food. 

* We have a worldwide epidemic of obese six month olds.  Yes, 6 months.  So it isn’t all about more food in and less exercise out.Baby with juice

* Americans now eat 141 pounds of sugar per year, 63 pounds of which is high fructose corn syrup and over half of which is fructose in all forms.

* A calorie is not a calorie.  Some calories are nutritious, some are merely empty, some are poisonous.

* If we are consuming 275 extra calories a day compared to 20 years  ago, it is because our regulatory hormones like leptin are not stopping us.  We had as much food available 50 years ago, but less obesity.  Something in us changed.

* And it isn’t our fat consumption, which has dropped.  Fat dropped significantly after 1992 when the food pyramid was established, suggesting we increase our carbohydrate consumption.

* Japan invented high fructose corn syrup in 1975, which was much cheaper than sugar and it is in virtually every processed food.

* At the turn of the last century Americans consumed 10.2 g daily of fructose, mostly as fruit which packages it with fiber.  Today we consume 54.7 g daily and adolescents 72.8 grams, mostly as soda and juice.

* Sucrose and high fructose corn syrup are virtually identical.  Glucose is less poisonous.

* Coca-cola used to be sold in 10 oz bottles, which would add 8 pounds a year if consumed daily, although it tended to be a weekly treat.  Now it is sold in 24 oz bottles as a single serving.   Your supersize 48 oz Coke if consumed daily will add 57 pounds per year.  Coke has caffeine to make you pee, salt to make you thirsty and sugar to cover up the salty taste so you will consume more.  And it no longer has glucose in it, but fructose.

* The WIC (Women, Infants and Children) program pushed fruit juice which is pure fructose, and is feeding those obese 6 month olds infant formula with 43.2% corn syrup solids and 10.3% sucrose, not to mention the inflammatory Omega 6 safflower oil.  It is a baby milkshake.  (The lactose in breast milk doesn’t do the same damage.)  Coke has less sugar than infant formula.

* Fructose is NOT like sugar, even if it were provided at lower levels since it is sweeter than sugar.  But we consume much more of it than sugar.

* Fructose makes 7 times more Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGE) than glucose.   These age your skin and arteries.

* Fructose does not supress ghrellin, the appetite hormone, but glucose does.

* Chronic fructose exposure promotes Metabolic Syndrome (Insulin Resistance.)

* Fructose tells your brain that you are starving, even while you are storing its breakdown products as fat.  It short circuits your appetite-regulating hormones.

* Fructose is metabolized like ethanol and it causes 8/12 of the chronic diseases that chronic alcohol consumption does.  Fructose is a chronic hepatotoxin.

* A can of soda has the same impact on the liver that a can of beer does.  Fructose is ethanol without the buzz.

* A high sugar diet IS a high fat diet, because sugar makes fat ( by de novo lipogenesis) and fructose makes a lot more fat.

* With 120 calories of glucose only 26 calories goes into your liver.  With fructose, 72 of the calories go into the liver, and in the process generates problems like gout.

* The uric acid from fructose that generates gout also increases hypertension.

* Fructose also generates VLDL, the really bad cholesterol and tryglicerides.

* If an elite athlete just ran a marathon and burned off all of his glycogen, fructose would increase glycogen stores faster than glucose. If we are exercising to lose weight, we haven’t used up our glycogen stores. But for the rest of us it causes the generation of toxins.

* In 6 days of high fructose corn syrup, normal medical students doubled their triglycerides, increased de novo lipogenesis (new fat) by 500%, and doubled free fatty acids which causes insulin resistance, and increased nonalcoholic fatty liver.

* You don’t exercise to burn calories, you burn to improve your metabolism, to increase your skeletal muscle which burns sugar, to reduce stress (which causes obesity) and burn off the sugar byproducts before your mitochondria can turn them into fat.

* Fiber reduces the rate of intestinal carbohydrate absorption in your gut, increases intestinal transit time so that your satiety signal is triggered earlier, and it inhibits absorption of long chain fatty acids so your gut bacteria break them down into short chain fatty acids which suppress insulin.

* Fructose inhibits the activity of insulin within the liver, giving liver insulin resistance and changes the way your brain recognizes energy in a negative manner.  High insulin generates obesity because you can’t burn fat, and at the same time you are eating more and more.

* We used to consume over 300 g of fiber daily in paleolithic times, now we consume 12.

* A mostly raw paleolithic diet, low in carbohydrates, low in sugar and high in fiber, can cure type 2 diabetes within a week.

* The more sugared beverages a child drinks, the less lifestyle changes will affect obesity.

* Get rid of all the sweetened beverages in the house except water and milk.  Eat your carbohydrates with fiber, as in fruit. Wait 20 minutes for seconds.  Set up an hour per hour tradeoff between active play and watching TV or using the computer.

* The FDA, by statute, regulates only acute toxins, not chronic toxins.  So although fructose meets all the definitions of toxins, it is “Generally Regarded As Safe.”",15,14,2011-04-25,PHARMA,0.057687897235155106,0.9108061492443085,0.03150595538318157

However, there has been a weird sort of bump in the tissue there ever since.  Is this a cyst wall?  Can I get it somehow removed, and if I don't does that mean the cyst will come back?

Health,"Any opticians want to talk about eyes, specifically nearsightedness?","**tl;dr** *Bolded text on the bottom*

I have so many questions I don't even know how to start..

I've done many searches online, on how to 'fix' nearsightedness or what causes it to begin with.  

My story started when I was young, in school I always remembered being sat in the back of the classroom, so it became quite obvious when things started to become blurry.  Throughout elementary school and early middle school, I've gone through glasses that became thicker and thicker each time I got a new pair.  I even recall one of them giving me headaches after wearing them all day at school, and I would take them off when I got home.  But the clear vision; not having to strain to see anything became addicting, and I would wear my glasses all day (lying on my bed watching tv, playing video games without having to squint or move closer to see specific details).

Today, I can not clearly read text that is.. I'd say.. 6 inches away from my eyes without my glasses.  (My contacts are -5.00[L] and -5.25[R])

With a couple of google searches, I have found a tremendous amount of support for both sides of the argument of ""Does wearing glasses worsen your eyesight?""  

Some tend to say that glasses and contact lenses are merely a tool that just helps you focus light better, which makes sense, but with my constant need for new pairs of glasses while growing up, it makes me believe the other side of the argument.  This of course, questions what the other side of the argument is.  Quite a few other websites, such as [this](http://products.mercola.com/vision-program/) tend to say wearing glasses actually make your eyes lazy, thus, becoming worse.


**So solely, my question is, **(to opticians, or anyone who has studied human eyes in general)  **does wearing glasses effect the growth of your eyes and nearsightedness?  **

Additional questions:

1. Without the advertisements of certain books or methods you need to buy, is there **any** method to better improve eye sight?  Growing up, my mother has told me that carrots have certain vitamins that help the growth of eyes. 

2. This question is kind of random, but do other animals suffer nearsightedness as well?  For example, cats are known for their keen eyes, but has anyone wondered if there are any nearsighted cats?

Health,19 year old with chronic back pain,"Hi all,

I've been dealing with moderate to severe lower back pain for about 5 months now. I didn't suffer injury from a car accident or any other event. This condition just came out of no where one day after work.

The doctors have figured out that I'm having severe muscle spasms that are pulling my spine out of alignment, to the point where my the lumbar portion of my spine is straight, causing pain and sciatica. I've been sent to physical therapists, massage therapists, and chiropractors for the last few months, and nothing seems to help. 

As of recently, the pain is not usually as bad as it has been in the past, but it's constant and flares up from time to time. My doctors will no longer prescribe me pain medication or muscle relaxers, so I've taken advantage of my state's medical marijuana, which seems to at least prevent my muscle spasms, but it does not really do much for the pain. Every time I attempt to skip a day of medical marijuana (be it lack of time or desire), I suffer from terrible spasms that cause me a great deal of pain and sets me back to where I started as far as my back is concerned.

I've considered getting an MRI or something of that nature to see if they can find a cause, but every doctor I go to discourages it. I figure being 19 and having not been in any sort of physical accident would be enough to raise some red flags?

---TL;DR---
I'm 19, have never been in any sort of accident, and I've been suffering from severe lower back pain, sciatica, and muscle spasms for 5 months.

Health,"My sister cuts, my mom is bulimic, they are both depressed... Please help me. I don't know what to do.  [x-post from /r/depression]","I am very worried about both my mom and my sister, and I don't know where to go. I figured this subreddit would be the best place. (As title says, I already posted this in /r/depression.)

Context: I am a senior in high school, my sister is a junior. We live with our mom.

My mom has had an eating disorder for a long time, I think since she was a teenager. She is divorced now, but her ex-husband (my father) was a narcissist and was very abusive. Whenever she has to talk to him for any reason (usually money for my sister and I) she gets very upset. In the last year of their marriage she went to rehab for her eating disorder (it was getting very bad with both my dad and her hostile work environment). About a year ago I used her bathroom (my sister and I share a bathroom, and my mom has her own bathroom in her bedroom) and I saw vomit in the toilet. I confronted her about it and she said she wouldn't do it again. Then later (I'm not really sure of the timeline) I saw vomit in her toilet again. This time I actually sat down with her and made her talk about it.  She was *very* defensive and denied it at first, and then after we started talking she opened up a little bit more but was still defensive, and also very upset. She said she hadn't done it in months, not since the last time I saw it, and it was because she was extremely stressed that week, especially because of something that had happened with my dad (I'm not sure exactly what). I made her promise not to do it ever again, and she did. Then just the other day I heard her purging. I confronted her again and, once again, very very defensive and denied it at first, and she said almost the exact same things - that she hadn't done it since the last time I confronted her, and that it was because she was stressed with my father and that she had had a hard week. I said I didn't believe her, that she was saying the exact same things she said before. She said she would call her therapist the next day. Obviously, I am very worried about her. Every time I use her bathroom I worry I will see vomit in the toilet. Almost every time I use it, there is not actual vomit but I can tell she had purged, there is a kind of sheen, a glisten, on the water. Her therapist specializes in eating disorders but I am still worried about her. And I am worried about confronting her because that just stresses her out more, which I am afraid will aggravate her eating disorder. As the title says, she is depressed, and she has very deep emotional issues after living with my father. I also don't like confronting her because it shows how worried I am, and then she feels guilty, which makes things worse. I don't know what to do.

EDIT: I'm also worried she's an alcoholic. Her father died of alcoholism and she always warns me that alcoholism runs in our family. Every night she has at least two drinks but I don't really keep a keen eye to see how many. Also her glasses of wine are very full and may very well constitute 1.5 drinks. She went to a couple AA meetings a while ago and said she liked them (she said the ones she went to were full of women like her - middle aged women with kids who maybe have too much wine at night), and I have tried suggesting she go back, but she gets super defensive and says it's normal to drink. And if I notice she's on her third or fourth she says ""Look, it's been a rough day, get off my back.""

That's only my mom. There's also my sister. She also has severe emotional issues from living with my father (I don't know why I don't -- somehow I am just very emotionally stable). She is also depressed. A while ago (not sure... maybe around a year ago, maybe 6 months) she was going through a really rough patch and she told my mom and I that she was cutting. I don't really remember what happened after that. I know she was seeing a therapist even before that but I don't think she sees one any more. Anyway, today I was surfing reddit and I heard her crying in the shower. I immediately got worried. There are razors in the shower, and obviously the water would wash the blood away, so the shower seems like a very dangerous place for cutters. I showered after her and saw one of her razors covered in blood.

Here's some more details I remembered after writing that... She recently broke up with her boyfriend who I think is maybe depressed and maybe bipolar.  When they were dating they were both going through really rough stuff and their relationship was really unhealthy.  She said he made her cut herself (as in, he made her feel like cutting herself, not like he forced her to).  Now they are broken up, but they both still like each other.  My sister has been hooking up with random guys to ""try to fill the hole"" as she told me.  And she's been partying a lot; she now drinks (I'm not sure how frequently) even though she never used to.  She's by no means a heavy drinker (I don't think, anyway) and I don't think she parties too much or drinks too much, it is just a change in character because she didn't used to do that stuff. But that might just be her being a teenager, I don't know.

I have never been on /r/health before. This is a throwaway account, obviously. But after finding out my sister is still cutting, I really don't know what to do. I don't want to confront her because that will stress her out and maybe make things worse. I don't want to tell my mom because then she will get worried about my sister and get stressed and that will maybe aggravate her eating disorder. I can't go to my school counselor because if she finds out any girl is cutting they make the girl go to rehab and they make a super huge deal of it. Plus the school counselor isn't confidential with anything. I don't know who to talk to, but I also feel like I can't just sit here and do nothing. I was considering asking my mom if I could see a therapist so I could get some advice? I just feel so immensely worried, so overwhelmed, so scared, so helpless. Please help me.
