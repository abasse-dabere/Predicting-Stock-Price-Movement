If this post gets some good responses I plan to post a link in r/Dentistry so more dentists will see it.

My specific question has to do with the number of pills to prescribe - when I'm writing a prescription for antibiotics for a patient with an artificial heart valve, for example, I will typically prescribe a few more doses than I expect the patient to need within the year (still usually only 3-4 doses for most patients unless we have a lot of treatment planned). My assumptions are that amoxicillin or clindamycin will last for at least a year before its expiration date, and that it is probably cheaper to get 16 caps once than 8 caps twice, or if not, that they are at least so cheap anyway that the minimal cost will be worth not having to go back and get another prescription if it ends up being needed.

I think this is both very surprising from a legal standpoint and very interesting in light of this sub's recent discussions on euthanasia.  I am just paraphrasing, but I think I read some comments here about how euthanasia is not practiced but high doses of opioids are given to terminally ill patients that inevitably have the effect of a slow fade.  How is this case charging a doctor with 25 counts of murder going to affect that?

I came in with my CPR card 3 days layer and my DM was there I showed him the card, but he said he was letting me go. Wtf?!?!?! I was given 3 days to get the cert and I met the deadline, but still got fired. He said it was because I gave a few immunizations while my CPR card was lapsed.

Is this a normal reaction on the part of the DM? I really enjoyed my job and I will miss my fellow employees and patients. I always put in a lot of effort and my reviews were good. This is the first time in my life I've been fired. I've been a pharmacist for over 20 years.

Icu nurse here with a dumb question- does anyone know why precedex has to be given in the icu? I work at a large trauma center, and patients can only be started on a precedex gtt if they’re in icu. Also, I understand hospitals are different everywhere, so this may not always be the case. 
I know it causes hypotension and bradycardia, so is it just related to frequent assessments/monitoring?

medicine,One Patient Seeking Assisted Suicide in Another State Is Pitting Everyone at My Hospital Against Each Other,"A patient was admitted to my ER for an unrelated reason to their terminal diagnosis -  while packing.  In talking with them, they gave me their history, their diagnosis, and the host of problems and suffering they live with.  It came up that they were moving from my State to a State where Physician Assisted Suicide was legal specifically to be able to ""end their life on their own terms"".   

Physician Assisted Suicide in my State is not legal, and we have pretty robust legal mechanisms for involuntary commitment, psychiatric holds, and forced social worker intervention for expressed or reported suicidal ideation.  

I chose not to do anything because Physician Assisted Suicide was legal where they were going, and once they left my own State, those laws didn't apply.  Well, one of the nurses decided to call Psychiatry who then called Social Services.  A forced 72-hour psychiatric hold was handed down, along with Court-ordered mandatory ""check-ins"" to the person's home.  If you're wondering how that's possible, Social Services fills out their own petitions and gets a Judge to e-sign within hours.  

Meanwhile, a massive rift has opened up on my service between just about everyone.  Nurses confronting physicians who support assisted suicide saying ""you should be ashamed to be a doctor""; physicians who don't support it berating nurses who do saying ""that's why you're just a nurse, you have no medical ethics"".  Pharmacy is nearly on the brink of open rebellion because almost no one down there will approve (eg conscience) any orders for sedation of this person when they try to leave AMA.   

I think they are probably going to fire a Resident who said openly they would drive the patient  out of State once they were discharged.

VACCINES,"I want to get vaccinated but my mom is antivax and Ive had an autoimmune reaction as a toddler, what should I do at 18?","(on mobile sorry for any formatting stuff yadayada; any suggestions on where this should be reposted would be nice)

Backstory: Im currently 16 and my 40yo mom is 
strictly antivax, saying things like ""Its an experiment, the government is hiding the truth!"" and ""Your generation gets way more than we did, why didn't we get sent back for more?!"" ""It causes autism and seizures!"" Etc. 
As a kid I was always taught that vaccines were bad, but all of the antivax memes and such made me really think... you want to believe the person who only wants to protect you but this topic doesn't seem right at all.
She's super strong and caring but she's really into conspiracy theories lol

When I was one years old a series of vaccines was said to give me a serious autoimmune reaction; doctors putting me on heavy antihistamines and hives that lasted a few years (I remember having a ton of uncomfortable hives pretty often). I got a waver from the allergist stating that any vaccines would cause this issue again. But the twist- when I got my overdue shot notice I saw that I received a polio shot FIVE years later! This was unknown by my mother and there was no known reaction either. Which gets me thinking, what's really the issue?

I snuck a photo of the mail with my immunization history since my mom would refuse to let me take one (because letting your daughter do actual research would be ridiculous!) I can't attach a photo so here is the list (I was born 08/11/02):

DTP-  #1. 10/28/02, #2. 01/07/03, #3. 03/17/03, #4. 9/19/03

*Now most of these vaccines listed were last given on 09/19/03; the last time I got mostly vaccinated.

QUESTION: Since there's no way of getting to my mom, Is there a way I can get vaccinated again? Who should I see once I am 18, an allergist? Which vaccines am I life-protected from? I want to be vaccinated but on the other hand scared that ill have another serious reaction.

medicine,Regarding the admittance of suicidal ideation in the Emergency Medicine setting,"Hello everyone, the above is a topic that has recently grabbed my interest that has recently grabbed my attention due to recent patient encounters and I thought it would be beneficial to introduce some discussion on it to hear opinions from medical professionals of varying backgrounds and localities.

First I'll expand on the title as I can imagine it can seem a little vague. Throughout my short five year career working in emergency medicine, both in EMS and in the Emergency Department, I've noticed one patient demographic that seems particularly prone to complications. Patients who are either introduced to the system with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation or admit to suicidal ideation during triage seem to be prone to escalating emotional distress and potential violence against healthcare workers, which can significantly derail the course of their treatment and potentially create a significant negative impact on the future of the patient and the staff.

Here's an example:
1. A patient checks in to the ER with a chief complaint of abdominal pain.
2. During triage the patient admits to suicidal ideation, oftentimes after prompting from a line of questioning that is a part of triage protocol. In my experience this patient would need to be medically cleared and would either be screened by a social worker in the room or transferred to a crisis block within the emergency department.
3. Over the course of the process of being evaluated and cleared by the social worker the patient becomes emotionally distressed from being trapped in an isolated and unfamiliar environment and begins to lash out emotionally and verbally. 4. If deescalation techniques on the part of the staff are unsuccessful it could lead to aggression from the patient and subsequent chemical or physical restraint.
4. Long term, the patient could face charges for assaulting healthcare workers and receive a treatment course entirely different from what they originally needed

Unfortunately this is a progression that I've personally seen occur several times from patients who were initially upset but cooperative and eventually descend into severe emotional distress and outright aggression. There are a few potential exacerbating factors that I can guess at:
1. Locked psyche wards in Emergency Departments that, while necessary, reinforce the feeling of entrapment in patients
2. Comorbidities such as anxiety and schizophrenia that make stressful situations much more unstable
3. The similarly necessary confiscation of personal belongings that introduces a sense of urgency and dehumanization
4. The psychological stress of not being able to track time if clocks are not present in patient rooms

This is an issue that I've experienced, however my experience is limited to a few hospitals and health systems in the Midwest and Southern United States. I'm curious what opinions you might all have on:
1. How patients who admit to suicidal ideation should be handled if it isn't the chief complaint
2. Whether these patients should be allowed to leave AMA
3. What can be done to make these situations less stressful for these patients
4. What factors may lead these patients to become distressed or violent
5. Any other thoughts you have on the issue: (If this issue is important in emergency medicine, If my understanding of the process is totally off base, If I'm talking out of my ass)

I look forward to reading all of your input!

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone who has included their input in this discussion. From the experienced physicians and upper level practitioners who can provide insight into the complexity of managing to these situations, to former patients who can provide their perspective on the process, and u/treebeard189 giving info on the EMS side of things. This has been a beneficial experience for me to learn more about this course of treatment and I hope it's been beneficial for you as well. There are many more topics like this that I would enjoy discussing on this subreddit if people are interested so please let me know if that would be worthwhile and maybe what topics people would be interested in.

In a few of the 15+ minute PEA arrests I’ve participated in which resulted in ROSC, the post-arrest rhythm was stated by intensivists to be an “adrenaline driven rhythm” and would be unsustainable.

Physiologically, what is going on here? What exactly is an “adrenaline driven rhythm” and what makes it unsustainable for more than half an hour? How can I tell if it’s adrenaline driven or not?

pharmacy,I'm getting sick of working at my pharmacy.,"So I'm a 20 year old tech that has been working for Kroger for almost 6 months. At first I was having a good time but now I'm realizing how shitty it is. 
The first thing that is so shit about my pharmacy is the store manager. I'll call her ""talki"". Talki is a manager that if you go to her to ask for something, she gets another manager to deal with it. I went without a legal nametag for almost 5 months (it didn't say Pharmacy Technician on it. I had to ask her daily and she'd push it off saying ""I'm not ordering something if it's just a nametag. No Talki, you will. It is because of a law. Talki also walks into the pharmacy unannounced and tries to talk to me when I'm on the phone with patients or giving them medication. 
Another problem I have is the pay. I only get $8.50 p/h as a licensed tech. I understand that I'm only 20 so I don't really need that much but I have no motivation to work if I get treated like shit with a shit pay.
The third problem is the pharmacy itself. it is filthy. dust EVERYWHERE. cobwebs. roach traps that has been there filled up for over 5 months. broken cabinets, same carpet and wall since the pharmacy was built over 10 years ago. broken lights. I've only seen someone vacuum one time since I have started in December. I am the only person that cleans and sanitizes the eyecon (automatic counter) with alcohol swabs. the other techs use cotton balls that come from chalky stock bottles. On Friday, I was cleaning up random shit and asked my boss if I could throw away over 20 stock bottle cotton balls that were in the little basket and he said yes.

pharmacy,Why consults after a new Rx is extremely crucial,"Been working as a lab tech for about 2 years now and I’ve realized the importance of a pharmacist’s consult is for a patient, even if they have “already used this medication”. 

Story time: patient’s young daughter is prescribed amoxicillin for an ear infection  pharmacist wanted to give the mother a consult to ask a few questions, ask about allergies, show them how to administer and how much to give of the amox, to answer questions and anything else. Mother is furious screaming at me saying she knows how to give amoxicillin to her kid she’s done it before and she doesn’t have the time for a consult. My pharmacist, seeing the patient’s anger, interrupts her and promises it won’t take more than 2 minutes. The mother says the same thing to my pharmacist that she knows how to use this, it’s a simple ear infection that’s it. So my pharmacist, being the badass she is, asks the patient to briefly explain to her what she already knows about this med and how to administer. So the patient reads the label stuck on the liquid amox bottle, saying “give ...ml x amount of times daily” so all I do is measure out the amount, and pour it into her ear and she’s cured. 
(Obviously my pharmacist corrected her)
And that is the reason why consults, even though they sometimes seem useless, can be detrimental if a patient forgoes their consult. 

TL;dr: patient not wanting to wait for consult, pharmacist asks patient how to give the meds, patient says since it is an ear infection, she needs to pour liquid amoxicillin directly into daughter’s ear",53,120,2019-06-11,PHARMA,0.07659163326025009,0.8968867659568787,0.026521556079387665

pharmacy,"""You WON'T be successful if you DON'T do a pharmacy residency""","I DIDN'T match for residency.

This was initially discouraging.  My other classmates had great match news to share, and I felt I was getting left behind.  In 2019, there were 2373 unmatched applicants for pharmacy residency.  These are pharmacy students and pharmacists that may have similar feelings.  The feeling of being lost and uncertain of what to do next.  However, when one door closes, MANY other doors open and were actually open all along.  I ended up landing my DREAM job that leveraged my true strengths and expertise because I took a different path.

Together with my pharmacy informatics colleagues, we tackle the societal norms of pharmacy residencies.  I had a resident tell me ""You won't be successful if you don't do a residency"".  By her logic, there would be thousands of unmatched and unsuccessful pharmacy students last year….including myself.  Our message is to really say, ""Hold your head up high!  You have a lot to offer in the world.  And, that it is okay to not match and that there are many paths of pharmacy, not just one.""  Don't get me wrong residency is fantastic and accelerates your clinical growth. It's great if you think that is for you.  But, if you don't match or didn't do a residency, there are many ways to get to where you want to be.  So don't be discouraged if you didn't match.

I remember who I am, and I’m not going to let this career torture me anymore and ruin what I view as the sanctity of medicine and the ability to truly provide care.

pharmacy,A PSA from your local Pharmacist - LOOK AT YOUR RX BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE DOCTORS OFFICE!,"This is a friendly reminder to all patients who look at this sub.

When you get a handwritten Rx from the Dr/PA/Nurse/Midwives/Janitor/everyone else who can prescribe in California but 99% of pharmacists; READ IT, especially if its a C2.

Look at the Rx, look to see if it half-ass looks right.  

* Do I expect you to decipher the sig? No.
* Do I expect you to notice that Duragesic 100 (that you've been on for years) has been written as Dilaudid 100? Yes... sorta.
* Do I expect to you notice that it says in huge letters ""DO NOT FILL UNTIL &lt;date&gt;""? Fuck Yes!
* Do I expect you to notice that the absolutely wrong name has been written on the Rx and the hardcopy was someone elses? Oh hell Yes!

Lets be honest here.  People make mistakes.  Wires get crossed and drugs sound the same.  MD's make mistakes.  We make mistakes.  However taking 2 seconds of your time taking a lookie-loo at your hardcopy can save you 20 min's of driving all the way back to the doctors office (or a wasted trip to the pharmacy).

medicine,Rural Africa: Removing Uvulas to Cure Diarrhea,"was living in a Sudanese refugee camp when stumbled across an old man who made a living performing uvulectomies on 4-8 infants every morning. The babies were generally 2-6 months old. Because the uvula looks like a worm, the refugees believed that it dripped down into the stomach and gave the newborns diarrhea. For the next three months I looked down several hundred (adult) throats and did not find a single intact uvula. This tradition is pervasive throughout rural North Africa.

I filmed [the man removing uvulas](https://youtu.be/EztSR1a_2PA) as part of a PBS series. The footage is unusual because foreigners are not allowed inside the refugee camps before 8AM and all of these surgeries happened at around 6AM while it was still cool out. 

I have found almost nothing in the literature about this procedure. I’d be very interested in your comments.

N.B: I filmed a whole series of stories on traditional medicine in Africa – including the local bleeder, burner, butcher-surgeon, etc. I would love to post some of them here – in every case there were aspects that I could not explain – but I don’t want to overstep.

pharmacy,Thankful Epileptic,"I have epilepsy and pick up at least one script every week. My pharmacy (a chain inside a grocery store) has the best pharmacists. They constantly check for discount cards, check on me when I don’t look like I’m feeling the best, and everything else that I could ask for. 

Joyce and Jeremy, you two run a tight ship, but it means the world. For someone with a chronic illness, it makes it that much easier to bear. You guys truly make it easy to pick up my meds. Not to mention, you constantly work to make my copays as low as possible saving me thousands of dollars a year. 

Everyone else, be like Joyce and Jeremy. They are amazing people. They make chronic conditions seem like nothing and make me feel welcome in a world that makes abnormalities feel unwelcome.

pharmacy,Original vs Generic: a battle to the death,"Lab tech here. I was curious about other people’s stance on original medication compared to generics. I am aware that certain generics (or even original) can act differently on some people but I wanted to know what your thoughts are on it. 
I’ve had patients come in before and start accusing us of a conspiracy theory to try and feed them “less efficient medicine” just because they were “less wealthy and they couldn’t afford originals” or their insurance plan may not pay for original medication (please note: that where I am there is Medicare, for most but not all, and private insurances are quite common in people working full time or if they pay for it). And on the other hand I have patients come in and just ask for the least expensive medications or for whatever their insurance (if they have one) will cover. 
So often people say “I want the real stuff” and I’m like well they’re both real medications, one is made by a different manufacturer than the original and may have different non-medicinal ingredients but it still is real medication.

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently started a new job and I am really struggling with second guessing myself and confidence at work. I left my last job because I was not fast enough and able to keep up with metrics of the retailer. I was not able to find a hospital job, and in order to stay afloat i had to make a pretty lateral move to CVS. I am in lower volume stores, however I don't have as much tech help so I'm trying to address these problems and start improving before I end up in the same position I was in at my last job.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody have any Advice for trusting in CVS's current system. I find myself struggling to trust the computer system, knowing that it is designed for catching mistakes. Specifically I am struggling with:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Trusting that its the right patient selected during the initial verification that a prescription is typed correctly.
2. When I get to the bottom of the first verification I have a hard time just entering through, and I tend to start re-verifying scripts a second time.
3. When product verifying, I know that there are a ton of barcodes, but I get held up at product verification on every script cause I look at the pill and quantity, and repeat myself so much.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I am dealing with undiagnosed OCD and maybe some anxiety, because I repeat myself over and over, and a tech asked me if I'm trying to commit the info to memory rather than just quickly looking at the script info. I am trying to stop my bad habits, but I was wondering if anybody has any advice for how and why they trust CVS's computer system, and things that might ease my mind about different parts in the verification process?

&amp;#x200B;

Also if anyone has any advice or tips they use for taking a second to calm down or stay calm at work. I tend to get very anxious and as the day goes on, my repetition and speed get worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance so much!

biotech,Are all small time pharmaceutical clinical research sites run like this? Should I be reporting the one I’m at?,"Throwaway account as I now see that this is serious. Please keep in mind that this took several months to write and compile and may not flow nicely.

I work for a local small pharmaceutical clinical research site as a clinical study coordinator. I’m slowly starting to figure out that things here aren’t run the way I thought it would be. Our site has about 2-3 studies going on at once (soon to be 7 total if we include both locations), with a total of 5 coordinators including me. We all get paid way under the national average. I previously tried to negotiate my wage at 17/hr, and my boss told me that it wouldn’t be possible at all at her location. Right now, I’m making 12/hr which is the minimum in our state, and our highest paid coworker is at 21/hr (this is kept a secret because she is aware of how much we all make and was only getting paid that much due to the boss's desperation of keeping her around. Our wages are 12, 13, 14,16, 21). I took this job out of desperation and lack of self-worth, even though I know I’m worth more than 20/hr, me asking for 17/hr was already lowballing it. We are understaffed and overworked. Our boss also seems to be someone who loves to micromanage.

Our studies involve phase 2 / phase 3 drugs, usually to relieve pain. We do some pretty normal things. We screen patients / do visits, take their vitals, their bloodwork, urine, and then fill out source documents &amp; enter it in an online database to match our physical paperwork. Normal stuff.

I have also learned that our site does some shady things and whatever we can to get patients through the trial. 

Here is a list that I have found that were questionable: 

· Faking patient drug compliance (boss asks us to take home e-diaries and do it ourselves in place of the patient), this is especially alarming since we have some studies that rely 100% on patients doing the e-diary 

· Faking visits (using our urine for blood tests so that excluded drugs would not show up in tests/ hooking us up to EKG to fake vitals for an unscheduled visit), 

· Not paying our patients for visits (boss doesn’t pay some of our patients because boss doesn’t feel like they should get paid for the telephone visits, boss has made it so that the patients don’t have to come in physically for visit 2 so they don’t get paid and boss pockets the money, or boss just doesn’t tell them about the pay at all), 

· Informed consent is shady. Most of our patients only speak a different language. Our boss is speaking to our patients in this language and they can’t read English so the ICF is signed upon her explanation of it in that language. Our boss doesn’t mention the e-diaries during the ICF screening visit most of the time which is why we have to take it home &amp; sometimes will not mention the compensation &amp; only goes over some details so boss picks and chooses depending on the patient). I have also noticed that if a potential patient (ones we get from Acurian or whatever recruitment site we use for the study) knows their rights slightly or is somewhat familiar with the process, our boss will find any reason to screen fail the patient. There have been times when the boss has forgotten to have the patients sign the ICF form during the screening visit and will have them sign it during randomization or forge it.

· Boss will often not inject patients with study drug but on books will say it was done (because patients experience adverse reaction and wish to discontinue from study but then boss will tell them they can continue with study and boss won’t inject them and boss will continue to pay them for the visits), etc... 

· Boss often coerces patients to stay in the study, as stated above. Most patients are unaware that they can leave the study for any reason.

· Our office is located within a clinic building that has a general practitioner’s office (our PI) + exam rooms, a pharmacy, and us. Technically our PI is supposed to assess our patients (physical and neurological examination) but they do not and we just have him sign the books according to the dates we put saying that the PI did. We also rush to get books done as well as the online data done before the monitor visits, because no one seems to get things done on time (but I’m sure the deadline thing is just a normal office thing). I realise now that this is pretty shady of our PI's as well.

· The site has gotten in trouble before for inconsistencies (faking drug compliance / accountability; years later the sponsor came back and asked why some patients were marked as taking the drugs but their lab test show they haven’t taken the drug). This is just something I heard from a coworker.

I’m assuming all this goes on because it gets my boss more money if there are more patients going through the trial.

Recently something happened that has made me realized that I have to report this site. Subject A was coming in for one of their visits (5th) but was out of the visit window (due to some discrepancies with having a coworker do the e-diary but I cannot get too specific with this). So our boss had us process the patient as visit 6 instead and came up with a fake reason as to why the last visit was missed. If I remembered correctly, patient A had no longer wished to be in the study a few weeks prior and refused to come in for the visit. I was suspicious when I came into work and the boss said that patient A is coming in. I am bad with faces so I did the visit vitals / source documents but I had a hunching feeling that the patient who came in was not subject A. I look through the patient confidential ID files and looked at the ID we had on file for patient A. I then realized that the person who came in as patient A was NOT patient A at all. My coworker then told me that she had heard the boss say that the boss was going to bring someone else in, in place of patient A. Coworker had told me she recognized the patient that came in for the visit was someone from one of the previous studies they had done. Add fraud identity / theft to the list of shit this site has done.

Furthermore, in regards to patient safety, the take-home pill form of the study drug was incorrectly dispensed to a different patient, patient B, and we had notified the boss of this (as the boss was the one who incorrectly dispensed the kit due to being careless in nature). This was brought to our attention when trying to dispense Patient A’s drugs. Instead of reporting this serious mistake, the boss opted to use alcohol wipes to erase the patient B’s information off the bottle and replaced it with the “correct” information with Patient A’s info. This is concerning because now there’s a possibility that Patient B got a double dose of the study medication because of the incorrect dispensing. The study procedure is double blind and there is an injection / take home drugs. If the injection is a placebo, then the take home drugs aren’t. If the injection is the study drug, then the take home pills are placebo. Since patient B was dispensed and incorrect kit number, there is a chance that they received a double dosage of the study drug, which would explain all of the adverse effects that patient had endured &amp; why they had dropped out of the study. This makes me sick to my stomach.

All of us lowly coworkers talk amongst ourselves about how we resent the pay and lowkey resent our boss and how we can run the site better if our boss would just stay home etc etc. We scoff at the idea of being our boss’s business partner in the future (something our boss hints at as they want to open more locations) because of how our boss refuses to pay us a decent wage now. We are not dumb. We know this is a lucrative business and that each screening, the sponsor pays the site thousands &amp; more with each visit. There is much more that I cannot express here. I personally have not partaken in any of the questionable activities mentioned, because since this job pays less than I would care for and I am familiar with clinical trials, I literally say no to any of my boss’s ridiculous requests. I have also notice my boss refuses to hire males, but that’s a whole different issue. My other coworkers are struggling students and need the job for references / experience and my boss is taking advantage of that. They were also hired when they knew nothing about the field. My boss tends to not hire anyone who seems to know what they are doing / are familiar with the field. (I’m certain I was hired because the boss heard I had a degree and was willing to work for minimum wage).

I quickly realized that I actually love doing this type of work and interacting with patients as well as doing the clerical work and interacting with monitors etc etc; I just don’t love having a boss that’s terrible at communicating, makes us do things out of order, makes us do questionable tasks, falsify documents (forge ICF forms when there’s a dating error or write ‘not clinically significant’ when our PI forgets to write it in) etc. I have thought about opening my own research site in the future, but before I think about it any further, I wanted to know if some of the minor things mentioned were normal thing for clinical research sites to do (ex: not paying for the telephone visit because the patient didn’t come in). I would love some insight into what a (legitimately?) run clinical site is like for a clinical research coordinator. I would love to open my own site in the future. I love seeing patients’ quality of life improve during the duration of the studies.

And if this is something I should be reporting, how would I go about that? Do I still have to work here to report the site? Would I get in any trouble? Would my coworkers get into any trouble? I am sure that no one has reported this site, even though there are plenty of disgruntled ex-employees, because all of us coworkers have such a tight bond with one another. There are a few clinical sites in the area that won't hire from our specific company because the boss was a past employee and knows of the shady things that go on here...",38,56,2019-06-18,PHARMA,0.11869060744841893,0.8561323086420695,0.025177056590716045

pharmacy,Vent away! Let’s here some of your recent crazy patient interactions!,"Title pretty much states it all. On mobile so sorry for any typos I miss. I’ll start off. 


Today we had a new patient come in, flustered. She had a prescription for 120g of clobetasol. She mentioned we were her third retail pharmacy that day and the other two were acting entitled and crappy towards her by overcharging her and her insurance. Regular stuff per usual. She didn’t want to wait 15 minutes for us to type it up and fill it, so just stood at the front counter watching us....staring (while we helped people the next register over, with constantly butting in with “it’s not done yet???”). Price comes out to something like $150 through her insurance; predicted she’d flip out so I printed the claim information showing she had a deductible and that it was applied to it as I brought out the medication. 


Well of course, she started screaming at us, saying we were taking advantage of her. Etc etc etc. I calmly explained the deductible and the pricing, and asked her if she wanted to get a 30 gram tube instead to try it, and to save money. After some heavy sighs and grunts and mutters, she said okay. Okay, cool.  

Went back to change the quantity and to re-process through her insurance. As I was still within earshot, I heard her say to her husband that I was an idiot and should be working a laborer job with “the mexicans” (I’m located in CA, so I hear the latino/a hate all too well). Brushed it off cause verbal abuse of course is expected. Less than a minute goes by, and I hear her start making fun of every employee in the pharmacy. One tech is a little chubby, and pointed to them and said loudly for us to hear that “maybe THAT ONE lay off the cupcakes for a day, if you can make it”, followed by making fun of our PIC because she looked way too young to be in college let alone a pharmacist. Told her husband (which, by now, looked like he wanted to kill himself) that the staff pharmacist was too skinny and wasn’t healthy and doesn’t practice good health even though she’s in a medical role (yet, she’s fit as all hell). Told my PIC what I heard, so she told me to go out back to tell them we’d happily transfer the prescription to another pharmacy or they could have it back as we don’t tolerate body shaming here and unruly behavior. 

Oh my lord. She FLIPPED OUT. We are located in a grocery store, so tons of shoppers nearby stopped and gawked. She demanded my manager, so the PIC went out, explained what I had already said, with now a smaller tube for a reasonable price. The woman did not want her prescription back, she wanted it free of charge. My PIC said no, 3 options: we give the hard copy back, you pay out of pocket, or pay through insurance. Then she got even more mad. She went to her cart, grabbed a liter sized coke, and was mid-throw before her husband slapped her arm down while I rushed out to protect my PIC. My PIC (a smaller woman) got spooked naturally and ran back into the pharmacy with the prescription, while she hurled more insults about us. She then took our pens on the counter and threw them everywhere around the pharmacy, calling us all a POS, among many others. She got one last try to throw that coke at us, but luckily it got stuck in her cart. She left without the prescription hard copy or the medication. 


She posted on every social media site within an hour saying how we illegally held her lifesaving medication from her and to be expected to be sued.

medicine,"[Writeup] Hong Kong private hospital ""will not treat any people who are injured due to criminal activities"", sparking controversy","[reuploaded for a more accurate title]

*[updated on 21^(st) June, 1015 HKT]*

&amp;nbsp;

Hi! I know you guys are increasingly bored of Hong Kong politics flooding your Reddit headlines, but I guarantee that **this post has nothing to do with politics.**

&amp;nbsp;

###I repeat, in compliance with sub rules, this is an apolitical, medically-oriented post.

&amp;nbsp;

Make no mistake. Again, timeline time. But some basic info:

* **Hospital Authority**: Public statutory body, overlooking gov't-funded healthcare e.g. public hospitals. This time it is almost not involved.  
  * **Dr. Leung Pak-yin**: Incumbent CEO of HA.
  * **Yan Chai Hospital** (YCH): A public hospital under Kowloon West cluster, one of 7 geographical clusters.
* **Hong Kong Adventist Hospital** (HKAH): Hospital in question. Privately-run, thus outside the supervision of HA.

---
##Timeline - 2019 June, HKT (UTC+8)

* 9^(th), 1430: Protest against bill amending extradition laws.
* 9^(th), 2300: Gov't states that the legislature is to discuss the bill as usual.
* 11^(th) night: Protestors begin to occupy streets.
* 12^(th), 1500: First wave of conflict between protestors &amp; police.
  * Police designated conflict as riot
  * [Ammo](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/13/just-restrained-hong-kong-police-say-150-rounds-tears-gas-20-bean-bag-shots-fired-anti-extradition-law-riot/): Several rubber rounds, 150 tear gas bombs and 20 bean bag rounds were spent
* 12^(th), evening: [Some protestors were arrested](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3014356/teacher-prominent-hong-kong-school-among-four-arrested) in public hospitals after telling the staff their whereabouts.
* 14^(th) to now: Physician-lawmaker Dr. Pierre Chan publicly questions policy of patient privacy in HA, and its relationship with the police. (This controversy itself is worthy of another post, and I haven't completely caught up with the entire development yet).
  * **The following exhibits may provide additional context to the recent controversy within healthcare circles**
  * Example: Development on [17^(th)](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/17/police-can-access-full-details-injured-protesters-hospital-says-medical-sector-lawmaker-following-patient-arrests/)
  * Example: Development on [18^(th)](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3014931/hong-kong-hospital-authority-denies-leaking-data) - note the involvement of medical student groups
* 20^(th): [HA CEO Dr. Leung conducts press conference (Cantonese snippet from i-Cable News)](https://www.facebook.com/icablenews/videos/705052359941784/), in which he confirms:
  * **A patient was arrested at YCH, after being referred there from HKAH upon arrival. HKAH contacted the police shortly after the referral.**
  * **On inquiry from i-Cable, HKAH states it ""will not treat any people who are injured due to criminal activities (不會治療因為犯罪活動而受傷的病人)""** and declines to comment on whether it contacted the police.
* 20^(th), night: No arrested protestors have been formally convicted of their charges yet.
* 20^(th), night: [Press release (Chinese only)](https://www.hkah.org.hk/getfile/index/action/images/name/5d0bb57374315.pdf) from HKAH. Excerpts:
  * No-one related to the conflict last week has attended the HKAH on Stubbs Road [*i.e. hospital in question*] (就上星期所發生的衝突，並未有相關人士到 香港港安醫院─司徒拔道 求診)
  * Although owing to limited resources, we cannot offer service to patients with serious trauma (e.g. suspected [...] gunshot wounds [...] etc. ) [...] however, we will offer utmost support and treatment immediately, so as to stabilise the condition [*of patients*] before referring to a public hospital for next level of treatment. (雖然受醫療設備所限，本院未能為嚴重創傷（如懷疑[...]槍傷[...]等）[...]等個案提供服務，但仍會盡力提供一切即時的治療和支援，穩定情況以轉介到公立醫院接受進一步治療。)
* 21^(st): According to [Ming Pao (Newspaper article in Chinese)](https://news.mingpao.com/ins/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/article/20190621/s00001/1561074046227/%E3%80%90%E9%80%83%E7%8A%AF%E6%A2%9D%E4%BE%8B%E3%80%91%E8%AD%89%E9%80%9A%E5%A0%B1%E7%96%916-12%E8%A1%9D%E7%AA%81%E6%A7%8D%E5%82%B7%E8%80%85-%E8%8D%83%E7%81%A3%E6%B8%AF%E5%AE%89-%E6%87%89%E8%AD%A6%E6%96%B9%E8%A6%81%E6%B1%82):
  * HKAH confirms that on 12^(th), it reported an injury suspected to be related to the Admiralty conflicts to the police, on the police's request (荃灣港安醫院發新聞稿證實，院方本月12日曾應警方要求，通報懷疑涉及金鐘衝突而受槍傷者的個案予警方) - flow:
  * 12^(th), 1800: Police officers arrived at HKAH, requesting the hospital to report any gunshot injuries suspected to be involved in Admiralty conflicts (約下午6時，有警察到醫院，要求通報懷疑涉及金鐘衝突而受槍傷者的個案)
  * 12^(th), 2230: A patient arrives at their A&amp;E. A nurse offers basic care, then suggests calling an ambulance to transfer the patient to the nearest public hospital, but the patient leaves on his own. Then, the manager at post reported the incident to the police for suspected gunshot, on the police's request. (同日約晚上10時半，有病人到該院急診中心求診，護士提供基本護理服務，再建議為該病人召救護車轉到最近的公立醫院求助，他選擇自行離開。院方確認，該院當值經理其後應警方要求，通報懷疑槍傷個案。)

##(1) Do private hospitals in Hong Kong turn away certain patients?

####Here is where I feel like I need legal advice.

I am not completely sure.

Lawyer Melody Chan [stated](https://hk.thenewslens.com/article/120676) on 13^(th) June that ""private hospitals may not be willing to treat gunshot wounds (私家醫院可能不肯治療槍彈傷口)."" I have yet to find verification on this statement, because it seems to be the only relevant result upon Googling.

&amp;nbsp;

##(2) What's the condition of the arrested protestors?

As of [20^(th) night](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/19/hong-kong-police-release-eight-anti-extradition-law-protesters-arrested-unrest-loitering/), 32 have ever been arrested. 5 were charged with ""rioting."" 8 were unconditionally released, their charges of ""loitering"" dropped upon insufficient evidence.

Nobody has been formally convicted of their charges.

&amp;nbsp;

##(3) When do *public* hospitals contact the police during this kind of mass incident?

####I do not recommend taking this as official guidelines.

According to Dr. Leung's conference, translated and edited from Cantonese to written Chinese by i-Cable:

* Definitely not upon discovering injuries inflicted by tear gas bombs. (在[發現]催淚彈[傷痕]的過程中，不會在這方面報案，一定不會)
* With clinical basis for rubber rounds, because they [*possibly refering to clinical presentation of wounds*] are hard to distinguish, but grey areas still exist for that requirement (但橡膠子彈有時候比較難分[…]當時要看臨牀決定如何，當然有時候是灰色地帶)

- Over 500+ RPh fired nationwide (Float, staff, PICs, whoever it is above PICs, etc) 

- Over 1K pharmacy staff overall (including techs) fired

- Mainly people who have been with the company for many years and are now getting paid 'too much'

- Pharmacy departments have been losing increasing amounts of money, OTC departments have been keeping most pharmacies afloat bringing in over $50k/month

- Corporate is looking to hire new grads for much less pay (some have already confirmed $30-35/hr in Texas and Florida) to 'balance out' their losses

- WM is looking to eventually, in the near future, get rid of their retail pharmacy model and implement a revamped version. They're trying to put in clinics at most/all locations where you can go for PCP visits, urgent care, dental, opto, etc. Pharmacy will be more focused on MTM, or so they say.

pharmacy,Differences between pharmacies in Denmark and USA?,"Hey, I've been a long time lurker of this subreddit, and despite being a pharmacy student (I have a B.Sc.pharm, currently pursuing a Master's), there are so many posts here that I can't relate to or understand at all. This has led me to creating an account and writing this post: What are the differences between pharmacies (and pharmacists) in Denmark and USA? I'm going to list a few things about our profession in Denmark, and hopefully you guys can enlighten me as to how it's done in the US.

* You become a pharmacist in Denmark upon receiving a Master's degree in pharmacy (M.Sc.pharm), which usually takes 5 years. A 6-month internship at a pharmacy is included in the curriculum, and is the only time away from school during the entirety of the study.

* Around 70 % of Danish pharmacists work in the pharmaceutical industry, with Novo Nordisk being the biggest workplace. Only about 18 % work in ""primary pharmacies"", which I believe is the equivalent of working retail. The rest are employed at hospital pharmacies.

* Primary pharmacies in Denmark are privately owned, and only a select amount of pharmacies are allowed exist. The amount is decided by the government, and only pharmacists may own a pharmacy.

* The price of medicine is the same in the entire country, so it doesn't matter which pharmacy you go to or where you live. The prices change bi-weekly to keep prices competitive. Prescriptions are written electronically, and can be filled in every pharmacy in Denmark (and in most cases, the entire EU).

* Medications are divided into substitution groups, meaning that products with the same amount of API and route of administration can get substituted for a cheaper option. So even if a patient has a prescription for Selozok, they can choose to get another product containing metoprolol for a fraction of the price. [Example with Selozok (""depottabletter"" means extended-release tablets](https://gyazo.com/65b46e6380322ce1290dede93ba5ac94)

* Pharmacies are legally bound to offer the cheapest product in a given substitution group, unless the price difference is less than what amounts to a dollar. They also make the same amount of money whether they sell the brand name or a knock-off. This does not apply to OTC meds.

* Another profession than pharmacists, called pharmaconomist/""medicine knowledgeable"", is allowed to fill prescriptions. In a mid-sized pharmacy, there are usually 3 pharmacists and about 10 pharmaconomists. It takes 3 years to become a pharmaconomist, and most of their education happens locally at a pharmacy. Both pharmacists and pharmaconomists are also required to (attempt to) engage in a discussion with the patient about safe use, potential adverse side effects if relevant, etc.

* Every Danish citizen is given an automatic grant to help finance their use of medicine. If a patient has purchased for more than 980 DKK (150 USD) in the span of a year, all prescription meds are 50 % off. This scales to 100 %, ensuring the maximum amount spent per year is around 4300 DKK (650 USD). This system is tax-funded, and is in the same budget as our universal health care. One caveat is that the discount it calculated based on the cheapest option in a given substitution group, so if a patient insists on a brand name, they will have to pay the difference themselves.

These are the things I could think of off the top of my head. I hope you're as curious about pharmacies in other countries as I am! If you have any questions or want me to elaborate on anything, please let me know.

There's an option for you to select a significant decrease in salary, but you'll have to give an estimate of what your yearly earnings may be. This is a safer option than deferment to prevent unpaid interest from capitalizing on your loan balance when you come out of deferment. It will also keep you in the clear with making consecutive payments in the off chance your loan balance will not be paid off in 25 years.",41,146,2019-06-27,PHARMA,0.410380095243454,0.535512387752533,0.054107438772916794

medicine,My attending is making me give everyone dextrose.,"I’m doing medicine nights this month and every morning I staff the new patients with my attending. A very high proportion of these patients are chest pain and urgent surgery candidates, so many of them end up being NPO for several hours. I usually start LR, especially if they are volume down. But yesterday she asked me “what does LR not contain that the patient needs?” My answer was phosphate; her answer was sugar. She then asked me to give all my fasting patients D5 NS or D5 LR, despite my protests that gluconeogenesis exists. Her response was that everyone will become hypoglycemic and “go into ketoacidosis” after a few hours. I’ve NEVER witnessed this. 

My question is does anyone have a source that D5 is neutral or even harmful in otherwise in non-hypoglycemic hospitalized patients? Ive heard in passing that it is indeed harmful. I’ve tried searching but there is too much noise out there.

Edit: she specifically asked me to send her an article that supports the notion that IV dextrose isn’t necessary in a fasting state. Maybe I’ll ask r/ketoscience",92,84,2019-06-27,PHARMA,0.06908953189849854,0.9005688428878784,0.030341561883687973

pharmacy,Let me tell you about pharmacy in New Zealand,"Inspired by the very interesting and informative pharmacy in Denmark thread, I thought I would tell you about pharmacy in my country.
* Pharmacy is a 4 year undergraduate degree and to become a registered pharmacist, you must also complete a year of supervised practice (called internship but it is paid) and pass both written and practical exams during this intern year.
* Most pharmacists work with in hospital or community pharmacies (similar to the US retail pharmacies). Most community pharmacies are owned and operated by a pharmacist, our law requires least 51% of a pharmacy to be owned by a pharmacist. We are just starting to get big chains moving into the market and there is talk of changing this law.
* We have a public health system funded by our taxes. There is a national formulary of funded medicines and three months supply of a funded medicine costs NZ$5 (US$3.36) (and free for children under 14). There is a NZ$100 (US$67) cap on prescription charges for a household so over the family has 20 prescription items, it is free until the end of the year. This only applies in the community and there is no charge at all for any medicines given in hospital
* Generally only one brand of a medicine is funded and a patient will have to pay if they want a different brand (eg Ventolin costs an additional $4.50 over generic salbutamol). There is a central agency (PHARMAC) who negotiates with the drug companies for the best prices and consequently we have some of the lowest drug prices in the world.
* Medicines can only for supplied for up to 3 months on a single 
 prescription (30 days for controlled drugs) and the patient must get a new prescription for any more.
* Pharmacies tend to treat a lot of minor injuries and illnesses to try and free up the doctors for more serious cases, we do a bit of triage by checking rashes etc.
* Some medicines can be prescribed by a pharmacist in certain circumstances eg. ECP, trimethoprim for uncomplicated UTIs in women, OCs, sildenafil, codeine containing pain relief combinations etc - these medicines require a consultation with a pharmacist and I believe are similar to 'behind the counter' medicines in the US.
* Most pharmacies are open normal business hours eg 9am - 6pm during the week and shorter hours (if at all) on the weekends. Definitely no 24 hours or drive through pharmacies.
* The average salary for a community pharmacist is around NZ$80 - 100K (US$53 - 67K) annually and more if you own the pharmacy
