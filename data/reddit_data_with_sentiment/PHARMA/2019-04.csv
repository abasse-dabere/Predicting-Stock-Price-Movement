medicine,After becoming a physician - do you feel like your daily interactions with people changed? I feel like people are constantly trying to “test” me and they relish the moments they can pull one over on me.,"Maybe this is all in my head, but I am a young physician. I feel like since being christened with that title, that my every day interactions with people have changed for the worse. 

It’s usually from people that are slightly younger than me and I imagine that they feel like they have to prove themselves. I feel like people are constantly trying to test my “value” either cognitively or in other aspects of my life. Then, when someone finally finds a chink in that chain they are elated and they relish those moments. I know that there is a certain level of this with any interaction with people, but since becoming a physician it has become quite explicit and damn near constant with certain types of people especially.

It’s become rather exhausting. So much so that I avoid interactions with certain people. I believe I’m usually pleasant and amiable in talking to people but there are times when I’ve consciously changed my personality to be more stern, demanding and short with people so as to avoid any of the above interactions (and it’s worked).

Anyone experienced similar issues?",226,535,2019-04-01,PHARMA,0.1578206717967987,0.8164307475090027,0.025748563930392265

medicine,"How can actual healthcare providers help push back against the rise of pseudoscientific ""professions""?","EDIT: Some really interesting points so far. If anyone also has suggestions about addressing the political side of it (i.e. petitions to limit scope, add 3rd party regulation, etc), that would also be great.

Something I've been thinking of after watching the news recently. It seems that pseudoscientific professions like ~~chiromancers~~ chiropractors and naturopaths are getting more and more rights and impact in government, usually through lobbying politicians that don't know any better.

However, aside from some meek attempts from some colleges/associations, there's not a lot of push-back against this sort of BS. And the problem is that once these fields get certain rights, it's just not realistic to reverse them, [no](https://nationalpost.com/news/college-of-chiropractors-of-ontario-anti-vaccine) [matter](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/naturopaths-discipline-unnacceptable-claims-1.4982339) [how](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/chiropractic-treatment-children-bc-review-1.5042864) [many](https://www.redding.com/story/news/local/2019/03/15/palo-cedro-chiropractor-facing-criminal-charges-has-license-reinstated/3181698002/) [cases](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/naturopath-rabid-dog-saliva-zimmerman-1.4897090) [of](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/25/naturopaths-are-snake-oil-salespeople-masquerading-as-health-professionals) [incompetence](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2018/12/31/state-takes-action-against-physician-chiropractor.html) [or](https://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2015/07/10/this-is-what-happens-when-you-trust-a-naturopath-to-treat-a-real-disease) [harm](https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/body-work/examining-ties-between-chiropractic-treatment-and-vision-loss) [we](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-naturopath-found-guilty-of-manslaughter-as-quebec-court-of-appeal-overturns-acquittal-1.4686317) [see](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-29/evidence-based-care-experts-and-patients-question-chiropract/10952074).

What I'd like to know from any of the readers here is realistic ways healthcare providers can help push back against this. I do a lot of patient education as is, but I just feel like I should be doing more. Most patients I see don't even realize that the majority of actual health care providers think naturopaths and ~~bone wizards~~ chiropractors are charlatans.

medicine,Financial Advice for Third Year Med Students,"On rounds this morning we started discussing physician compensation rates (and how atrocious PedsID pay is) and our med students started complaining that they get little to no education about financial aspects of being a physician. Specifically, making specialty decisions, but also about post residency: single vs group practice vs hospital based and how that affects pay, negotiating contacts, opportunities outside of clinical practice and how to add income, financial advice (minimize loans, loan forgiveness etc). Basically all the financial stuff many of us learned the painful way. 

What financial/career planning advice would you all give these students?

pharmacy,Graduated 2 years ago and haven't worked since--do I have any options?,"Hi everyone,

I graduated from pharmacy school almost exactly 2 years ago, and I have not had any work experience since, and I have not even taken my board exams. I know that sounds really bad but I am trying to change for the better. I am writing to ask what my options are for employment, and what the best way of going about that would be. I am worried that my lack of work these past 2 years has totally erased the possibility of finding a job

&amp;#x200B;

My work experience during pharmacy school has been 6 months at a retail chain and 4 months interning at a pharmaceutical company as a medical writer. I am most interested in doing something that does not involve making clinical decisions. I am also interested to hear if there are any jobs that don't specifically require a pharmacy degree but where such a degree would be very helpful for employment.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to respectfully request that when replying, please do not unnecessarily criticize me or tell me what I ""should"" have done. I was unable to work for mental health reasons that I do not want to go into, but now I feel that I am ready to face the challenges. I decided that instead of committing suicide I will rise up and try to transform my life, and I am willing to do anything to make that happen. Anyway, it is what it is right now, I cannot go back in time, and I just need a little help to see if I can become a functioning member of society again.

2 guys came into the store this morning.   Fortunately we had about a 3 second jump as we saw them back in all crazy right in front of the store.

Demanded ""All the stuff"".    After 2 rounds from me  and 7 rounds from them they fled.  No injuries except for the walls.  They didn't even get back into the pharmacy.  It was a 20yard shot, getting (friendly) crap that I missed.

I'm not planning on leaving this store, its my baby.  Fuck living your life in fear.  People need medications, we're a service to the community.  Closing the store just punishes the legit people in my area.

This profession is dangerous.  Be safe everyone.

Edit: Clarification - sorta frazzled.

Edit2: Woke up to random gold.  Thank you kind stranger x 2.  I also want to thank you all for all the support.  Pharmacy is indeed a small community and having the support really helped me a ton last night.

Now that I have time to think clearly after a shitty nights sleep second guessing myself; to all the people who said that I shouldn't have missed, or I put innocent lives in danger, etc.  I respect your opinions, and I really agree with most of them.  However, its easy to armchair SWAT a situation like this after the fact from the safety of your computer. When you have about 3 seconds to prepare, less than 2 seconds to think, and 1 second to react during a situation that really cannot be planned or prepared for, its hard.  Add a bunch of screaming, yelling, adrenaline, and you have a big pot of suck.  Did I do the right thing? Maybe so, maybe not.  I did the best I could.  I have a /ton/ of range-time under my belt, but nothing, absolutely nothing can simulate the gut wrenching environment of an armed robbery.  Thats all.

pharmacy,I turned in my notice. I’m done.,"A day next week will be my last at CVS. I’ve worked on and off for them for well over 20 years, this last stretch being almost 5 years. I have never seen a company care so little about their patients or their employees. I feel like I’m letting my patients down, but when a major mistake happens due to the lack of technician help, and it will happen, I can’t have that be because I failed to protect them. I think that would destroy me. I love my profession. I remember the exact moment that I knew I wanted to be a pharmacist. It changed my life. It gave me purpose. This company has almost destroyed that.

I’ve tried to explain the risks of the current state of my store to my district “leader”, but they don’t want to hear it. We just get told that this is the new CVS. When I tried to explain that I almost missed a dosing error in a medication for an infant because I was so busy worrying about ringing people up, I got the response of, “What does that have to do with me?”  I was left speechless. Why are people that have zero concerns about patient care in charge of how I help protect my patients?

My resolve was finally broken when I had to start working weekends by myself.  Working a seven hour shift with no breaks for food or the restroom is just too much for me. I left over 50 prescriptions in QP last Sunday because I just couldn’t do them.

pharmacy,"I’m proud to be a retail pharmacist, how can I help defend our profession?","Hi all! 

I’m a new graduate pharmacist who’s been in the community setting for almost 8 years now (tech turned intern turned rph) and even with all the bs metrics and occasional disgruntled patient I think being a community rph is a rewarding job and serves a huge purpose in society. 

Even though I don’t trust/believe in APhA and especially distrust academia (they don’t have our best interest at heart) I am also in support of provider status and expanding clinical roles for pharmacists since at the end of the day we’re all in the same profession. However, I also enjoy community (granted, I’m in a target store so it’s more relaxed) and when a pharmacy is adequately staffed/has good techs and you open and close on time instead of working off the clock, it’s really a sweet gig that offers a unique flexibility imo. 

With the increasing saturation, exorbitant student debt load and decreasing work opportunities it’s easy for community pharmacists to get burnt out and let community be a “sinking ship”. What can I/we do to help? I apologize if that question sounds naive but I actually genuinely will do whatever I can to make a difference and recruit friends/colleagues with me to help save community AND even clinical/expanded roles since were all in it together. 

And to all the rphs out there please know your work is appreciated! I have 195k of student debt as well and I know how intimidating it seems but realize beyond the corporate demands and flaws with our job we really can make an impact on people and the appreciation is wonderful.",18,50,2019-04-06,PHARMA,0.024205652996897697,0.9039773344993591,0.07181695848703384

Pharmacists are now allowed to prescribe tobacco cessation and PPD skin tests but perhaps the biggest change is allowing the prescribing of drugs, drug categories, or devices that are prescribed within FDA approved labeling AND do not require a new diagnosis, are minor and generally self limiting, have a test that is used to guide diagnosis or clinical decision making and are CLIA waived.

See, here it's fairly simple... there are nurses and their assistants, doctors, paramedics and administration personnel. 

Doctors can be in training, already specialized in something and some of the latter have direction/management roles, usually with one or more deputies. 

A portion of nurses are specialized (say critical care, anesthesia, psychiatry, ward management,...) and perform more advanced duties, sometimes doing what was done by doctors in specific tasks and fields, usually with physician supervision (I really never understood why this way of practicing has been developed but it's fine by me, most specialized nurses are freakin' cool and they really know their stuff, I am learning a lot from them too).

In the last months I read about physician assistants, respiratory therapists, emergency medical technicians, nurse anesthetists, advanced practice nurses and so on... I tried to keep track of everything but I quickly became lost. Would someone have the patience and the kindness to shed some light on this matter for all of us simple-minded european folks? :)

These include serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, psychological distress, and suicide.

So let me get this straight.

Theres an Opioid crisis.  You (the DEA) want to curb opioid use/dependence by making us jump through hoops with 7 day supplies, override codes, etc.  Yet FDA warns of serious harm with sudden discontinuation or reduction of dose.

What are your thoughts?,"Recently found this clinic in Florida who are treating ""Burnout Syndrome"" with ketamine infusions. Anyone tried this? Thoughts on its future viability?

I'm feeling that burnout hard (spring of MS-2), but I exercise a ton, which keeps any debilitating anxiety &amp; depression from manifesting.

medicine,Do you continue to see patients in primary care who are seeing another doctor for high dose controlled substances that you feel are not indicated?,"I've turned down many patients for a refill who are on ambien and xanax 3 times a day including one Xanax ER a day. At best I'll offer a weaning schedule so that we don't stop them cold turkey. Many times they will refuse. 

There is a doctor near where I practice who has switched to direct medicine or concierge medicine. Ever since the switch, we have had a flood of new patients who are all on the same meds. Without fail, every patient I have of his is on the same regimen. Ambien 10mg nightly, xanax 1mg tid, and xanax ER once daily. Sometimes a norco or muscle relaxer will be on their profile too. 

I've noticed that this direct pay doctor will not fill anything but those meds for them and leave the DM II management with A1c of 13's up to me their new insurance taking primary care doctor. (me)

On one hand I want to help their medical problems but on the other I find it hard when they have two different primary care doctors, one of which seems to only be treating anxiety or insomnia with high dose benzos. Since I do treat those disorders but not with benzos long term, these patients will flock to the cash pay doctors near me to get their fill.

1) stay late to finish notes on time
2) go home, see kid, sacrifice quality of time/precious sleep and try to finish notes at home on time
3) go home, see kid fully, sleep, finish notes in a slightly delinquent fashion (our clinic does not have a rule about timing and many physicians leave charts open for longer than I do/shittier notes).

I will say : all my orders, diagnoses, and almost always my HPIs are fully completed shortly after leaving the room, so others see this even if my ROS/PE/plan justification is not.

medicine,"[meta] Let's talk about subreddit content, midlevels, and moderation.","A few times a year, we meddit moderators like to have a meta thread to discuss general moderation trends, content issues, and to invite feedback from the community about moderation. These threads help us get a feel for what the community enjoys about the subreddit and what they'd like to see change.

It's been a little while since our last one, so I'm sure there's a lot to talk about. Let's start with some stats:

We have eight moderators for this subreddit of ~228000 subscribers, a ratio of roughly 1:28,500. In 2019 so far, we've performed a collective 5320 moderation actions exclusive of discussions in modmail. This amounts to almost exactly 50 moderation actions per day. Being generous and assuming each takes about one minute to read in context, judge, action, and document, that's 50 minutes of moderating required between us in a 24-hour period. March 2019 was our busiest month ever in terms of traffic and moderation and that continues a trend of increasing traffic each month this year.

In terms of content, I think we need to start with the issue of this community's approach to midlevels. I believe that this is a pretty USA-centric problem, and so I'm not bringing much experience to the discussion here, but this has definitely been a recurrent issue on this subreddit.

This subreddit was founded to be a 'lounge' for medical professionals but has standards of civility that effectively amount to ""if you wouldn't say it to a new colleague you're just meeting in the break room, don't say it here"". Since the last meta thread, and probably even before then, we've been seeing a significant increase in [sweeping disparaging remarks](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/bd5ggv/north_dakota_passes_bill_allowing_pas_to_practice/) putting down entire groups of healthcare professionals. This is typically aimed at mid-levels (PAs, NPs, CRNAs, etc) from doctors and medical students. I have been approached privately and [on the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/b66ilq/what_will_keep_the_amas_ama_on_burn_out_from/ejoxsr3/?context=3) by a number of midlevels who feel that this [atmosphere](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/bd5ggv/north_dakota_passes_bill_allowing_pas_to_practice/ekwagv0/) makes it very difficult for them to participate in the subreddit and who are increasingly viewing meddit as an unpleasant place to visit.

I don't have the pleasure of being a part of a system where increasing midlevel autonomy is a hot topic or a 'threat', but I think that the tone of this subreddit with respect to these topics has certainly become increasingly toxic. This is, of course, on a background of the subreddit nearly doubling in size over the last year and globally polarised polemic becoming an increasingly common method of default communication. At the moment, we moderators have to balance censorship with civility, and regardless of our approach, we will be upsetting someone. Our steering approach has often been deliberately quite heavy-handed on this professional subreddit but we do recognise that this subreddit exists primarily for the benefit of the users, not the moderators, and to a certain extent we should tailor our moderation strategy around that.

So, that's the main reason this post exists. We'd like to hear your (constructive) thoughts on whether we should be more overt in prohibiting and removing content that is disparaging to midlevels (and where the lines should be, or whether it's best to leave it in our nebulous but hopefully capable hands), or whether the best plan is to trust the community to police itself with upvotes and downvotes alone. It would be really helpful if you could provide links to examples with your posts if possible to help us quantify the problem.

In other news, we are still seeing a fair amount of politics creeping into this subreddit. We've been removing content that is not explicitly and primarily related to the practice of medicine but, as with everything we do, there are people who feel that we allow too much and those that feel that we censor too much. What's the consensus on that recently in terms of community feeling?

We've been able to run a few AMAs this year and are looking for more. If you're an interesting person (sorry, 99% of you) and want the undying adoration of a quarter million people, get in touch.

Lastly, any and all other suggestions or comments are welcome here. This post will remain stickied for one week and we moderators will try to reply to things on a daily basis. As always, this is a subreddit that relies entirely on international volunteers with full-time day jobs, night jobs, and on-calls to moderate in their spare time and we couldn't make this subreddit work without our moderation team's efforts. If you've got a suggestion - or if you'd like to genuinely offer your help to the team (bearing in mind it can take up about a full hour each week), send us a modmail. If you've got a long history of good posts in meddit, we can even pay you in salt.",619,230,2019-04-17,PHARMA,0.059382143430411816,0.8565656840801239,0.08405218180269003

medicine,Let's generate a guide for effective email communication with a busy professional,"We are all drowning in work, and when we get irrelevant, inane, or poorly-written email it really stings.

Help me generate a practical list of actionable tips on ""**How to communicate with a really busy person**"".

Examples on from my own experience are

* **never reply ""thank you"" to an email** - if you are genuinely thankful, send a card. Otherwise, the most sincere thanks is letting their inbox stay empty for an extra 15 minutes
* **send anything that can be answered by the secretary to the secretary** - the administrative assistant knows exactly what the doctor needs to see, and can respond to many questions directly. You will get a faster answer, and the physician won't have to pay your attention tax
* **one issue per email** - since the inbox functions as a defacto ""to do"" list, don't put a long email with four different things you need in a single message ; make each one a message, and make them all succinct
* **make the subject meaningful** - the best email is the one you don't even need to open, because the subject says it all
* **use (NNTR) in the subject** - when you *have* to say something, but also don't need a reply back, put (NNTR) as the very first item in the subject. This tells the recipient that there is **N**o **N**eed **T**o **R**espond, which is an emotional gift when the inbox is full.

medicine,Why do we s**t on other professions?,"I’m in the healthcare personally for more than six years. I was raised by a mother who was a nurse for something close to 40 years, and one things bothers me to this day… actually almost every day: why a lot of people working in healthcare have a tendency to dismiss other professions and make themselves look better?

Let me explain, starting from the bottom:  

- **CPR instructors:** when I was doing a CPR training the instructors were describing how neither EMTs nor nurses can provide a good CPR and how much they’re better at this.
- **Phlebotomists:** I had an occasion to audit parts of the course as well as encounter phlebotomists both in the field and also drawing me. Due to limited SoP the main point of contention is how nursers are unable to draw, don’t know the order of draw, use too big of a needle etc.
- **EMT-Bs:** I went throughout the program and I currently teach it. I see a tendency of saying how paramedics or (especially) nurses are incompetent and how EMT-B will do a much better job at e.g. CPR or assessment. 
- **EMT-Ps/Paramedics:** Here I could write an essay but in short it’s a daily occurrence to complain at the nursing personnel. I constantly hear how capno, FAST, or intubation are some sort of black magic which paramedics excel at. Additionally there’s a constant finger-pointing about nurses being tethered to a physician with everything while paramedics are free to do almost anything (?!).
- **Nurses:** Here the complains are both downward facing (EMS) and upward facing to PAs and MDs/DOs. I constantly hear how the process of diagnosing patients is so much better while performed by a nurses, since they are able to spend more time with the pt. Additionally the drug dosing and tests results interpretation seems to be the biggest advantage of NPs over PAs/MDs/DOs.
- **PAs:** I don’t have a big exposure to that group, but a number of times (sometimes publicly and/or on social media) I’ve encounter Physician Assistants presenting doctors as money-grabbing machines with just „slightly more wasted years“ (an actual quote).


I deliberately left MDs/DOs out of the list, since the issue there seems to be way more complicated (e.g. fights between specialties, trying to prove that one residency is better than the other etc).  

### Why, just why we s**t into our own bed?!
I just wonder what’s your opinion on that? I personally think this is really inappropriate and simply selfish - we **are a team**, when even one of the preciously crafted gear of the medical machine is missing the work becomes harder and patients suffer as the result. Not to mention such behaviors simply look bad in the eyes of patients.

My family members -- most specifically my mother and father -- are constantly inserting me into their healthcare scenarios, but not in a way that I feel is okay.

&amp;#x200B;

My opioid-addicted father calls me 5 minutes after any healthcare professional leaves the room, most recently, IM and Surgery teams, to get a confirmation bias that ""they aren't doing everything they can"" (read as ""they didn't give me dilaudid"").  He has also called me to vent about the limitations of the number of Percocet his insurance company will let him have per month and to ask me ""what should I tell my pain doc?"" I don't have any intention of aiding his habits and have only ever tried to provide the idea that there are far better solutions but this is going on 20 years, almost as long as I can remember and I'm afraid ""precontemplative"" would still be a generous description. He has verbally stated, ""I'd rather live pain-free and die from my liver/kidney/heart/lungs than do anything else.""

&amp;#x200B;

My mother, on the other hand, is a pain-in-the-ass-by-proxy. She is a physicians worst nightmare as she has accompanied my step-father through his cancer diagnosis and subsequent surgery and his heart attack over the last 10 years. Everything is questionable with google at the ready. She has an astonishing, Dunning-Kruger-like level of confidence in her medical knowledge and is dismissive of anything other than what she thinks is best. She fires physicians regularly and my step-father long ago realized arguing with her is futile.

&amp;#x200B;

To make things worse, they mention me in these interactions. I happen to have good marks and am doing pretty well, which they use as ammunition in sort of a ""let me check with my son, he's an honor medical student"" way or a ""well I think my opinion is valid, my son is a medical student"" way... even typing that is cringeworthy. They put me on speaker and ask my opinion but only in the ""\[medical team\] wants to do X but I think Y is more appropriate, don't you?"" way. 

&amp;#x200B;

There could be so much more I could get into, with other family members my mother has represented in healthcare scenarios, but you get the gist...  I've attempted to avoid these scenarios but the not so subtle, yet honest ""please stop doing that"" has so far been fairly ineffective.

&amp;#x200B;

medicine,[Discussion] Is there something uniquely bad about health reporting?,"As an embarrassingly basic, upper middle-class, educated, urban liberal, I consume news from the New York Times and NPR in unhealthy amounts. I find their healthcare coverage tends to range from not-great to appallingly bad.

A recent [example](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/health/candida-auris-fungus-chicago.html?login=smartlock&amp;auth=login-smartlock) is a case of the so-called ""superbug"" _Candida auris_ at Northwestern University's hospital. In an unfortunate series of events, a women with pulmonary manifestations of worsening SLE ended up on ECMO -- due to uncontrollable bleeding s/p lung biopsy -- as a possible bridge to a lung transplant. After a month-long cannulation, she developed drug-resistant candidemia and died shortly thereafter. The article implies that had she not developed drug-resistant candidemia, she would have been completely fine. It never mentions that the odds of successfully treating even non-resistant candidemia while remaining cannulated were very close to zero, or even if she never developed candidemia, the odds of her getting donor lungs and surviving transplant after a month in an ICU were very close to zero. It also never mentions that people without prolonged immunosuppression and/or long-term indwelling catheters are not at risk for candidemia, whatever the drug resistance profile.

The article spins the whole thing as a lurid and unhelpful story about a cover-up because the state public health department isn't whipping up panic and naming every hospital with an identified case of _C. auris_ (it's every big medical center with complex patients in the ICU). They quote the family as wishing the hospital had told them what they were doing to prevent _C. auris_ before she got it (...?). The involved hospital unsurprisingly declined to comment, and the reporter included only a brief line from a CDC doc saying, ""yep we are seeing some of this"" without tempering any other elements of the story with, I don't know, expert commentary.

Anyway, this is far from the only example. I don't think I've ever heard or read a story in my preferred news sources on healthcare that left me thinking, ""what a good article."" Which got me wondering -- are all the stories on all the topics so distorted, superficial and sensationalized but I just don't know enough about international politics or finance to know better on non-healthcare topics? Or is there something uniquely difficult about reporting on something so personal and emotionally fraught as healthcare? Are there any sources in mainstream news media that tend to do a good job with health reporting?

My impression is that all news is imperfect, especially the short-form, 4th-grade-reading-level article which need to drive clicks, but that reporting on the complexity of healthcare is inherently more difficult than reporting on a military skirmish or political disagreement. Is that just my bias showing (healthcare is special because it's *my* thing)? Your thoughts, meddit?",31,65,2019-04-24,PHARMA,0.09971190989017487,0.8778918981552124,0.022396234795451164

medicine,What's the dumbest thing you've done in your training?,"A few examples have come to mind that shock me to this day

&amp;#x200B;

1. I was in a family medicine setting, I was going to vaccinate a 9 month old but didn't put the needle in the syringe correctly. As I injected, half of the vaccine leaked out. The mother started crying (and the baby), and wanted to apologize. The nurses vehemently discouraged me to do that. The staff doc laughed and said ""it happens all the time"".  I still regret not talking to the mom and apologizing.

&amp;#x200B;

2) On IM , we were individually rounding and was told a patient had a fall that AM and was anti-coagulation. I saw them and everything seemed fine. When running the list, the senior said ""she must be on anticoagulation for a while given the senile purpura"". I then realized it was the wrong patient -- mine didn't have any senile purpura. I told my senior in confidence and instead of scolding me said ""good for you to apologize and realizing your mistake. Not many do that. I hope to work with you again sometime"". It was truly bizarre feedback since it's a major fuck up

&amp;#x200B;

3) I was on IM rounding as a very very junior clerk. A guy just randomly fell to the ground and claimed his left arm went numb. I thought I was clever and called the code stroke before telling the resident.  The neuro team came and noticed he has chronic pseudo-seizures especially when he's about to be discharged :S.

pharmacy,Questions for an old pharmacist,"Hello Reddit Pharmacy,

My father has been a pharmacist his entire life. He is still working part-time now and belive it or not he started his apprenticeship about 60 years ago, in the 1950s. He has worked primarily in New Zealand but also briefly in the USA (NY) and UK (London).

He has such a wealth of experience and knowledge about the 'old days' so I am thinking of getting a video camera and doing an 'interview' where I can ask him questions about his experiences. Kind of an 'oral history' project.  (Also, demonstration of manual compounding, tablet making etc!)

So my questions to you are:

a) Does this sound worthwhile, and

b) Any particular questions you would like me to ask?

If the video goes ahead I will post it on youtube for everyone to see.

Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

pharmacy,CVS seems sketchy?,"CVS keeps texting me for refills (auto-refill is turned off) for any brand name drugs I have refills on. I have a prescription for Flonase that I used once for a cold but don’t need it. I don’t reply to the texts since I find them intrusive. 

Last week CVS texted me that they are still waiting for my Dr. to approve a refill. Then a few days *after* that they ask if I would like the pharmacist to refill it. Which seems to be the pattern - they act like they are waiting on the Dr or something is being processed then it loops back to asking for my permission again.

Last night my Dr’s office emailed me that they sent in the refill. I checked and sure enough, CVS had requested a refill for the drug and was processing it for me to pick up.

Maybe it’s a glitch in their system but it seems very aggressive/unethical  - how can they contact a Dr. for a refill that I never asked for. The pharmacy said it was all automated and they get tons of complaints about it.
