medicine,Is allowing a fistula tract to form before repairing an intra-abdominal perforation acceptable practice?,"I posted this question to /r/surgery without a reply.  Let's see if there are takers here.

---

I seek guidance from the esteemed surgeons of this subreddit regarding this question. I've recently seen several cases where a patient developed a perforation of a hollow viscus in the abdomen. Instead of immediately taking the patient to the OR to repair it, it was allowed to continue until it formed a fistula tract, such as to the skin or perhaps another hollow organ, such as the bladder or vagina, and only then would exploration commence. Meanwhile, the patient would rage with sepsis, often for weeks on end, causing no end of headache to my service (critical care). Is this an acceptable practice for hollow viscus perforations/leaks, and so, under what circumstances is this the preferred surgical strategy, as opposed to immediate repair?",20,40,2016-08-01,PHARMA,0.09181360900402069,0.8812803626060486,0.02690601721405983

medicine,Good luck to all those starting their first jobs as doctors in the UK tomorrow,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/3fs83w/good_luck_to_all_those_starting_their_first_jobs/) a year ago today, the evening before embarking on my first day as a doctor.

For those not familiar with the UK medical system, tomorrow is 'Black Wednesday', the day when all newly qualified doctors start their first jobs and everyone else moves up a grade and usually starts a brand new job in a new hospital.

For you guys just starting tomorrow,  good luck! It's terrifying but you'll do great. Although busy, stressful and emotional at times, it is a really good year and you'll be amazed how quickly it goes.

My one piece of advice, which I'm sure you've had drilled into you over the past week, would be to always ask someone senior if your not sure what you're doing. It is far far safer to annoy your boss with stupid questions than it is to be unsure and give the patient the wrong treatment.

medicine,Am I not allowed to be proud to be a doctor anymore?,"I'm about to graduate medical school within the next year. I’ll be 30 years old, and I’ll have been in school for 25 straight years, from grade school to middle &amp; high school to college to graduate school and medical school. It’s been years of hard work, delayed gratification, and overcoming challenges all finally so close to paying off. 

I’m excited, and I’m proud, and in my mind, justifiably so. And yet, as I've gotten closer to finally beginning this next working phase of my career, I’ve had this growingly uncomfortable feeling. That feeling is, everyone hates me. Not me personally, but me as a doctor. They hate me, they blame me, and they think I’m useless. 

Objectively, I'm very smart, and I’m willing to work hard. I could have successfully pursued a wide variety of careers. I chose medicine because it's interesting/challenging, because I want to make a difference by helping people, and because I want to be able to provide for my family. I was proud of that decision. 

What I’ve found, though, is the American public believes I am the one directly responsible for any healthcare shortcoming - whether it's high cost (I'm greedy), long wait times (I'm lazy), bad outcomes (I'm negligent). Nobody can convince them otherwise, and I just feel absolutely helpless about all of this. 

So how do I explain this to my 60 year old neighbor who doesn’t hesitate to initiate every conversation with me about how all his doctors are quacks and incompetent? How do you deal with the flood of negative comments about doctors in any health-related article? Am I allowed to be proud to be a doctor anymore?",27,59,2016-08-02,PHARMA,0.07849593460559845,0.8915901780128479,0.029913872480392456

medicine,Performing phlebotomy on inpatients with altered mental status who refuse consent?,"Hi all,

I'm a phlebotomist at a hospital in Washington state. I perform the routine inpatient AM phlebotomy rounds (no emergency or STAT phlebotomy).

I recently had a situation where my patient clearly had altered mental status - she could barely string together three words, she appeared confused and it wasn't clear whether she was aware of what was happening to her. According to the nurse, she had advanced dementia.

My first attempt at venipuncture failed. I was preparing to make a second attempt; the patient was exhibiting typical behavior for someone with dementia who doesn't want to be poked again (upset noises, withdrawing her arm, etc). I was just about to insert the needle when the patient became lucid enough to look directly at me and say ""I don't want that.""

I am a strong advocate for patients' right to refuse consent, and  I stopped the procedure and informed the nurse that the patient refused and that I was declining to perform the draw.

She wrote me up for it, and I ended up talking to the lab manager, who seems to believe that I have no right to do that; the doctor must have wanted that blood drawn, and it's my job to draw it and I'd better do it!

Well, I think I do have that right. I'm the one performing the invasive medical procedure, I'm the one with an ethical and legal duty to respect the patient's wishes, and that makes it my call. If the nurse doesn't like my call, she can draw the patient herself, or get someone else to do it.

Now, of course I'm aware that some patients have just enough marbles to say ""no"" but not enough to understand what's happening to them. The line between ""crazy, but capable"" and ""just plain crazy"" is subjective and difficult to draw.

What would you have done in this situation, or what would you expect a phlebotomist to do in this position? Are you aware of any established procedure or unwritten rules at your workplace that tell you how to proceed in cases like this?

medicine,How to respond to patients who ask for advice about homeopathy/alternative medicine?,"I reasonably often get asked by patients (or indeed, just people I meet) about my opinion on homeopathy/various different alternative medicine. They usually have a story about a neighbour/friend who visited one with a particular ailment similar to their own and was helped significantly.

Just today my dad (no medical background) was telling me that my uncle went to an ""alternative medicine"" man in my town (feeling generally unwell, no specific complaint) and the man took him off his statin (saying they cause Alzheimer's) and his ace inhibitor (saying they cause balance problems). My uncle feels great apparently, will not go back on the meds and is recommending this man to anyone who will listen.

So my medication will be delivered at my address, away from where I will be seeing family. 

How could I go about getting a 3-4 day supply to brig with me to my family?

pharmacy,Processed my first end of life drug to the first patient I ever helped in the pharmacy.,"I came in today and the first thing that popped up on my screen was for Seconal which I've never heard of. Asked my floater what's it's used for and she says it's an end of life drug which became recently legal in California to do. Alright, that's terrible to hear but I'm glad the person won't be suffering anymore from their ailments. Then I look at the patient and it's for the first patient I ever helped in the pharmacy years ago who comes in ever once in a while.  This elderly individual would come in and be the nicest guy ever and would never be a hassle to any of us and my heart literally dropped knowing it was for him. He was literally in my pharmacy a week prior picking up a normal maintenance medication. 

Anyways, my pharmacist calls the physician to verify that this is going to be used for that and OKs it so she gives it to me to order and since it's the weekend we can't order it til Monday/Tuesday since we weren't first aware it was a C-II drug. The patient recently went to hospice and they wouldn't pay for the $3500 for the drug, but the doctor verified the patient would pay for it.  That's that, ordered it to be l paid by the patient and it would be delivered to us. Im usually a real cheery guy in the pharmacy, but today I just couldn't stop thinking of it even though it is what's best for him. The biggest annoyance to me was that the patient/patients family had to pay $3500 since it wouldn't be paid for and here I am kinda sad, but kinda glad for the first patient I ever helped in my pharmacy career is moving on to better things.

pharmacy,Patient looking for advice on something nice to do for pharmacy team!,"Disclaimer; this was originally posted to R/talesfromthepharmacy but I figured I would get more luck posting here as well to get as much input as possible!
Hi! Patient here, I was over in r/pharmacy and while responding to a post that referenced how the poster gets judgmental vibes while filling his/her C2 prescriptions I started to reply how I'm so glad the techs and pharmacists at my local CVS where I fill have never been judgmental or anything towards me when I fill every month- especially because I have scripts for (30)70mg Vyvanse, (30)20mg Adderall, and (60) 0.5mg Xanax and (30) 30mg remeron. 
It got me thinking about just how many of these stories I hear from patients about either obstacles in refilling or the feeling of being judged as a junkie. I know that there are reasons why pharmacists need to use caution and discretion when dispensing these substances and I in no way blame or fault a pharmacist or tech who listens to their gut when issuing these drugs, however I have come to notice it happens to a lot of my fellow ADHDers among others and I just want to express my vast appreciation to my pharmacists and their crew for never giving me any horror story of my own to tell! 

They've always been so nice and helpful, I've filled there every month for the past 5 years and from day one have always treated my prescriptions as if it were any other drug like antibiotics or Tylenol. They never look at me sketchy when I always fill the allowed  2 days early (I like to prep in advance as I procrastinate and will likely forget if I don't do it as soon as possible) and they always greet me by name as soon as I walk up to the counter. I am so appreciative of that especially reading so many tales of other ADHD adult patients frequently getting ""the side eye"" 

OH! And I've never had to wait for anything to be ordered they've always got my prescriptions in stock and on the once or twice occasion that there have been insurance hiccups (shout out to tricare young adult south!) they go out of their way to help however they can on their end when dealing with the insurance company for me. 
Now that I think of it I really want to do something nice for the whole team there to express my appreciation- any pharmacy employees have suggestions on what i could do as a gesture of appreciation for all they do?! Would this be weird to get them all a gift or something? Or do you think it's something they'd likely appreciate the acknowledgment? Any advice or suggestions would be so helpful!",5,8,2016-08-07,PHARMA,0.06567388027906418,0.9070838689804077,0.027242278680205345
medicine,"Physicians who were pressured by family to go into medicine, how did it turn out in the end?","Next year is my last year of high school and I've seriously been thinking about my future this summer. My parents have been trying to convince me to go into medicine basically since the moment I left the womb. I, however, was never interested in medicine and always dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist. As a kid I could never picture myself as a doctor. It just never interested me. In fact, biology is my least favorite science subject in school.

End of sophomore year my parents were really putting the pressure on me and it caused a big fight. After a lengthy talk with my parents, I finally agreed to become a doctor. This entire summer I've been basically trying to mentally trick myself into thinking that I want to become a doctor out of my own free will. I had the opportunity to shadow physicians at 2 different hospitals thinking that getting a first-hand view of medicine and talking to people in the field might spike up an interest in medicine. At the end of it, while I did find it very interesting and gained a new-found appreciation for the hard work you guys do, I just didn't feel that spark or passion that pushed so many of you to enter the field. And the 13+ years of gruelling education do scare me. Funnily enough, literally every resident and med student I talked to told me not to become a doctor.

I do like the idea of dedicating my life to the service of others and of helping others. I feel like medicine, in spite of its many hardships, is a very satisfying career. You could look back on your life and honestly say that you made a *difference*. But I still have my doubts.

Sorry for the rambling. My point is, I'm just scared that I might be wasting my life away if I go with this medicine thing. To all you doctors who didn't have medicine as their first choice, how did it turn out in the end? Do you regret it? Did you learn to love it?

pharmacy,New Tech having trouble with Pharmacist (Update),"[Original Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/4uyjlw/new_technician_having_trouble_with_the_pharmacist/)

I spoke to the store manager the day after posting the original thread, explained to him the troubles that I was having with the Pharmacist (and then on top of that, them telling me that I wasn't allowed to transfer for 8 months) and asked him to please go ahead with the transfer if possible. He told me he would get the process started and that he understood that I wasn't getting any appropriate training and would make sure that I was getting more.

Last week my hours jumped from 9 to 26, which I thought was good progress! I was able to start learning data entry with the lead tech. Once the lead tech left for the day (this was on Tuesday) I was supposed to be in control of that 'station'. Pharmacist would not allow me to do any of the data entry at all. Instead, he left his station and came over to do it all himself with no explanation other than ""you don't know what you're doing."" Even though I had already been doing it with little to no trouble. Later on that evening I was helping a customer who had come in for some insulin needles. I got the pertinent information from the customer and when I turned to go retrieve them the Pharmacist stopped me and said loudly ""She doesn't know what she's doing *other Tech, take over."" By this time I had already gotten what was needed. I was confused, other tech was confused, and even the patient was confused.

That night before leaving I stopped the store manager to see how things were going with the transfer, let him know the troubles that I was having now such as learning something and then not being allowed to do it, and how I felt embarrassed in front of a patient for no good reason. Worked the rest of the week with the other pharmacist (who is awesome!) with no issues. Saturday rolled around and my upcoming 26 hour week is cut to 4 1/2 hours, today being the only day for me to work. Lead Tech texts me last night asking me to come in for a meeting at 11am today. I was a little nervous but thought that maybe my hours got cut because I was being transferred. Couldn't have been farther from the truth.

I went in with Store Manager and lead Tech today to find out that they hadn't even bothered to TRY and transfer me. I was told that Pharmacist doesn't want me in his pharmacy any more, that I was free to resign my position but that they had someone to cover my hours and I wouldn't be put on the schedule any longer. They basically refused to fire me pretty much, like they were holding me hostage or something. I don't know how to explain it other than that really. I'm a little floored still, pretty upset. I feel like I've been bullied out of my job and the people I thought would help me out pretty much didn't care. Pharmacy Technician is something that I really wanted to pursue, but now I'm second guessing myself about everything I've done, even though for a time I felt secure in what I was doing.

Anyways, I just thought I'd give an update and a thank you to everyone who gave their advice originally.",23,28,2016-08-10,PHARMA,0.07009456306695938,0.8968533873558044,0.03305201604962349

Had many people in the pharmacy field tell me that the beard was unprofessional. Then again, I've had people tell me my dress was unprofessional.

pharmacy,This man got 48 million dollars by revealing wrongdoings of a pharma company. Meet a real Pharma Crusader,"Can you believe that a man got $48 million (242 crores Indian rupees) just because he revealed the misdeeds of a pharma company?

Yeah you heard it right, it’s a truth.

The company of which I am talking about is Ranbaxy Laboratories and the man is Mr Dinesh Thakur. The Pharma gaint went from riches to gags and finally being acquired by Sun Pharma.

Ranbaxy Laboratories  in 2013,was exporting its products to 125 countries with ground operation in 43 countries and manufacturing facilities in 8 countries. Ranbaxy was amongst the top trusted brands in India.
But when  the news of acquisition of Ranbaxy by Sun Pharma came on 7 April 2014, the entire Pharma world was shocked. Do you know what was the reason for Ranbaxy’s downfall?

But before elaborating the facts let's know about the real pharma crusader who revealed the wrongful activities of the company.

Dinesh Thakur received his Bachelors degree in Chemical Technology from Osmania University, Hyderabad and  a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering from University of New Hampshire, and graduate training from Syracuse University.

Dinesh thakur joined Ranbaxy in year 2003 as the  Director &amp; Global Head, Research Information &amp; Portfolio Management at Ranbaxy Laboratories in Gurgaon. Thakur was tasked to scrutinize the data that Ranbaxy submitted for approvals to the US and other foreign markets during 2003-2005 .While at Ranbaxy, Mr. Thakur discovered that the company was falsifying drug data and violating current good manufacturing practices and good laboratory practices. He found that test results were being falsified for HIV antiretroviral and other drugs; he also came across sloppy manufacturing processes. In 2004, the engineer reported his findings to his superiors. But his evidence was ignored by his superiors and he was accused of watching pornography on his company's computer. He resigned in 2005 and left the country for US.
But then Thakur, dared to do what very few corporate executives dare to do. He gave evidence to the US authorities about the company falsifying drug data and violating good management practices, triggering a massive investigation. Two years later Thakur made a complaint in the US under the False Claims Act (FCA), also known as a ‘whistleblower’s law’. This enables private individuals to file cases against government contractors if they have information that the contractor knowingly submitted fraudulent claims to the government.
As a result, on 16 September 2008, the Food and Drug Administration issued two warning letters to Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. and an Import Alert for generic drugs produced by two manufacturing plants in India. By 25 February 2009 the US Food and Drug Administration said it halted reviews of all drug applications including data developed at Ranbaxy's Paonta Sahib plant in India because of a practice of falsified data and test results in approved and pending drug applications. On 8 February 2012, three batches of the proton-pump inhibitor Pantoprazole were recalled in the Netherlands due to the presence of impurities. On 9 November 2012, Ranbaxy halted production and recalled forty-one lots of atorvastatin due to glass particles being found in some bottles.Also in 2012, an apparent dosage mistake was reported in which 20 mg tablets were found in a bottle of atorvastatin labeled as containing 10 mg tablets; this led in 2014 to the voluntary recall in the United States of some 64,000 bottles. Thakur worked with US authorities for nearly 8 years.

In May 2013 the US fined the company US$500 million after it was found guilty of misrepresenting clinical generic drug data and selling adulterated drugs to the United States. In September 2013, further problems were reported, including apparent human hair in a tablet, oil spots on other tablets, toilet facilities without running water, and a failure to instruct employees to wash their hands after using the toilet. Ranbaxy is prohibited from manufacturing FDA-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility until the company complies with US drug manufacturing requirements.

Thakur, who worked for Ranbaxy for two years from 2003 before turning whistleblower, is now chief executive of Florida-based MedAssure Global Compliance, which advises drug companies on quality and safety.

Unusually for a whistleblower, Dinesh Thakur got a $48 million reward. During his career, he held senior positions at Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Ranbaxy Laboratories, and Infosys Technologies.

In context of India it is said that Whistleblowers are often harassed and threatened. Mr Thakur succeded because he had the backing of very strong USFDA.

So its my humble request to all pharmacists who are working with a pharma company. Please don't ignore the wrongdoings of the pharma company. Whether you are working in manufacturing, QC or QA ,be sure that the medicines which you are preparing there is also for your family.

My understanding is that the current absurd cost of albuterol inhalers is due to the CFC ban in '05 or so that has allowed brand manufacturing of albuterol inhalers with HFA (propellent).
With this in mind, is it to be expected that generics will become readily available again once the patents for these inhalers expire?

I know this seems like an obvious answer, but I'm confused about a couple other components of this... 
There are 16 patents protecting Ventolin inhalers (according to DrugPatentWatch.com anyway) - why is this? Is there potential for manufacturers to still maintain market control by pulling their products and creating inhalers with subtle differences protected by new patents?

I have similar questions regarding corticosteroid and LABA inhalers (combined and single therapy). Were these inhalers also affected by the same CFC ban? How are all of these inhalers still patent protected?

If anyone could point me to some sources to help answer these questions I would greatly appreciate it! I'm having trouble finding good data.",15,18,2016-08-15,PHARMA,0.04846500605344772,0.915549635887146,0.03598535433411598

pharmacy,Lets talk about Salary,"In regards to the 2016 pharmacist salary guide that was posted on Pharmacy Times, I thought it'd be interesting to see what pharmacists actually make. Since it's totally anonymous, don't hold back. 

Experience: ~1 year


Degree (Really don't know if this matters or not): PharmD, MBA 


Board certifications: none, studying for BCPS


Base Salary: 115k

I thought it'd be interesting too because from what I've heard from more experienced pharmacists, they top out quickly. I'm currently at 56/hr. What's ""top out""? Around 62/hr?

Edit: Add Sector too


Full time clinical/hospital with PRN at a chain. Did not include PRN as it's not steady income


Edit: love the additional data provided by /akcom 

Current stats: ~50 salaries reported, 17 in hourly wages, 33 in annual. Assuming a 40 hour work week for those in hourly:

min salary: 70k

If a patient asked you to do one would you or would you prefer to do a normal GA?
Im having my lap band removed in two weeks and am intrigued by the thought of watching my own surgery.

edit: update. Thanks for all the input. Yes it was an odd question. Yes I am slightly odd myself. I've had quite a few surgeries and have seen a few too hence my question. Unfortunately (fortunately) I haven't had anything orthopedic done apart from a wedge resection under a GA aged 10 so unless I miraculously get pregnant and convince them to let me watch the c-section I don't think I will be watching my own surgery any time soon.

medicine,How is homeopathy legal???,"I'm a current third year optometry student in the US and have several friends in medical school, and we are pounded with evidence based medicine all day every day. Constantly told to practice to the current standard of care and to always stay current to the research out there in respected peer reviewed journals. A good family friend has been having headaches, some weight loss, generalized fatigue among a whole host of other symptoms and sought out care from her ""PCP"". Her ""PCP"" apparently sent her to physical therapy who then sent her to consult with a homeopathy group based out of Arizona, which I just learned today allows Naturopaths (quacks) to practice telemedicine! Mind you my friend lives in NJ. They ordered all sorts of blood work for her and found TSH levels fluctuating from low to high, fluctuating blood glucose among some other hormonal variations, and to treat this she had to buy hundreds of dollars of supplements from them. We just found out she has been doing this and now have her set up with a legitimate PCP to figure out what really is going on. 

Are naturopaths not held to same liability standards other healthcare professionals? If I as a future optometrist simply prescribe ""supplements"" to my patients with diabetic retinopathy I would lose my license so fast you couldn't even say presbyopia! (rightfully so).

I have goals, such as buying a house soon, and kids in the future, as well as aggressive retirement saving. I am pretty frugal and have managed to pay off my student loans and carry no large or high interest debt. But, after going from being a frugal, poor-ish student not making much, to a pharmacist working 50+ hour weeks making much more in a couple months than I made in a year in school, I noticed I have become lax in areas of spending that probably would have sent me into shock when I was a student. Even though I haven't been impulsive with large purchases, I spend more on a day-to-day basis than I really need to. 

How do you other pharmacists deal with it? I am beginning my career and it is difficult talking with my colleagues at work because they are all accomplished from years of work and it feels embarrassing when I am still living in an apartment, driving a car with 100k+ miles with paint chipping...

pharmacy,Nurses or receptionists providing authorization?,"A few times a week I'll be calling an office with an issue on a prescription and the person on the phone will attempt to authorize my solution without consulting the prescriber.  The receptionist or nurse will say ""yes that's fine"" or some variation indicating they are expecting me to change the part of the prescription I'm calling to clarify. They don't even put me on hold or pretend to speak with the doctor. Am I crazy strict for thinking this is unacceptable? They always seem confused when I ask them to double check with the doctor, or get huffy and act like I'm asking a lot. More than once I've had someone try to give me one answer and after they checked with the prescriber it turns out to be a different answer. Just wondering what you guys do because I'm sometimes viewed as a hardass or a bitch for wanting to avoid an error and cover my own ass.

pharmacy,Has anyone ever had a Suboxone film patient report white dots appearing on one of their strips?,"**Update**: contacted the manufacturer. They assured me that the film had no problems with it and that it's an anomaly they expect to happen in the manufacturing process from time to time but it is still safe for the patient to take.

**Original post:**

I had a customer come in today who had brought in one of his Subxone films.  I'd never actually seen one out of the packaging before, I had no idea they were so small.  Anyway, he showed us the film and it did have lots of tiny white dots all over the film.  While it still had it's natural orange color, the film itself did seem a bit washed out looking compared to the picture of a normal film I compared it against. It still had the ""N8"" logo printed on it, and the white dots looked to be a similar color as the logo but it wasn't exact.  I told the patient that I thought it was probably just a stamping anomaly but I couldn't be sure so he obviously didn't feel comfortable taking it and I don't blame him.

I wish I'd taken a picture of it that I could upload here but I just didn't think to at the time. I told the patient I'd look into it tonight and get back to him on it tomorrow since it was a pretty unique issue that I'd need to look into.  Our other store pharmacist had never heard of it before but thought he shouldn't take it. I don't believe the customer was trying to scam me or anything either, he's been a customer for a while and never given us any trouble. He's well spoken (which is a rarity among Suboxone patients around this area) and it seems unlikely he was trying to screw us out of a single Suboxone film.

I'll probably just call the manufacturer tomorrow if no one here has any insight but your time is appreciated nonetheless.

medicine,Mid air emergency turns into multiple....,"My wife and I , both internal medicine residents, were on a long haul flight recently when a woman nearby had an reaction to the food. She vomited, flight attendants came by and took her to the galley. My wife and I looked at each other and then they asked for a medical professional.....

 By the time we got to the Galley she had hives, but was breathing at a normal rate. Checked some vitals, she was tachycardic but doing well. Asked a few questions. She has a bunch of food allergies and has reactions frequently, no epipen with her. So I listen to the patients chest and she has diffuse wheezing, can't hear much air. It's really loud on airplanes btw! I start discussing we may need epinephrine, albuterol, benadryl, prednisone (incidentally, the kit had it all!!!) with the other MD who showed up. This is when things begin to go sideways because the patients voice seems a little different. Then she has a little bit of stridor. The other MD, A Pediatrician is concerned about giving epi IM and is thinking about diluting for a drip.... At this point I checked my own pulse. I looked at my wife we strongly suggested we the give her IM epi. The situation became obvious and we gave her some epinephrine. Things start to look better pretty fast.

30 minutes later ANOTHER woman comes to the Galley, flushed, diaphoretic, nauseated. Her BP was 230/110.... For fucks sake.

medicine,Managing diabetes in the hospital setting,"Hi guys. I'm a new intern in internal medicine, currently on my night float rotation and have been getting a lot of calls about blood sugars on the wards, and asked to make certain management decisions on it. I usually ask my senior if I'm unsure, but I'd like to work out a good way to reason through these situations so I can make these calls more confidently on my own and bug them less often.

(1) So on night float, patients are often NPO at midnight for a minor procedure in the morning such as stress tests, TEEs etc. Nurses will often call me, noticing the patient has a large QHS glargine dose and ask whether to give it, give less of it, or place the patient on D5.

I've looked online for any sort of guidelines and can't seem to find anything clear and concrete about cutting the night time glargine. Some places say you leave it alone, while others seem to say you halve it, others are saying you only reduce it to 70-80%.

Is there a concrete, evidence-based consensus I can refer to? 

At least two of my residents have badgered me about halving it the night before, but one of my co-interns was recently yelled at by her attending for doing so. She was told that one should never touch the glargine dose. I understand the reasoning for that, since glargine is the basal dosing and theoretically, if it is dosed well, you should only have to hold pre-meal aspart on the day of the procedure, and the night time glargine should be left alone. However, people seem to do different things and I'm unsure of the best call to make. Is there anything I can lean on help me make a decision and support it?

Some of the nurses are also consistently asking me to place the patient on D5 1/2 NS on night float for patients NPO for a procedure the next day. My immediate concern is that this would simply provoke hyperglycemia. Considering from midnight until procedure, the most they will miss is one meal or two during the day of the procedure, it makes most sense to me intuitively that I'd just hold the pre-meal asparts. Is it common practice to put NPO-at-midnight patients on D5?


(2) I got called one morning about a patient who was due for a pre-meal aspart, however his blood sugar was 128. The patient had not eaten yet. My initial thought is that if the patient was going to eat, with that blood sugar it should be totally fine to administer the aspart. My resident at the time advised I hold it, however. The timing of the call was also strange, since it was at 7 am, yet breakfast would probably not be for another hour or two (per the same nurse)...which makes me wonder if they're timing it right. Naturally, nurses are busy, especially in the morning, and perfect timing is not realistic, but my understanding is you should administer pre-meal aspart 0-15 minutes before meals or immediately after.
So my question is, when do you hold the pre-meal aspart in the person who is about to eat? If it is common practice to give the pre-meal aspart so way in advance of the meals, what do I tell the nurses?


(3) I get called a lot about high blood sugars in the middle of the night. The other night I got called for a blood sugar of 340. I usually just give them the equivalent dosing I'd give off the sliding scale as a stat dose at that point. However, is that the right decision? Should I be giving anything at all? What are your threshold for these calls and what do you do?",12,11,2016-08-27,PHARMA,0.05845918878912926,0.9145115613937378,0.027029260993003845

biotech,Reg affairs 101: What you’ll actually do all day (x-post drugs_and_devices),"Hi everyone,
So I recently posted this over at /r/drugs_and_devices, and was told that it would be interesting for everyone over here as well. 
Basically one area which has a lot of open positions in biotech is regulatory affairs - but most people don’t know what the job involves and thus whether it would interest them. If you’re interested in the field, but aren’t really sure what a regulatory affairs manager actually *does*, then this might help out…

**TL;DR: Communication, organisation, managing, and a lot of writing**

**Communicating**

At the most basic level, you act as a *trader in information*. You’ll stand at the midpoint between a vast variety of departments, experts and regulators – and you’ll be keeping information flowing between each and every one of them. Emails, reports, meetings, phone calls, the job involves keeping people up to date and in the loop. Communication lies at the heart of regulatory affairs, so expect to do a lot of it. 

**Organising**

Are you organised? You’d better be – you’ll be juggling multiple projects at any one time, plus various meetings and whatever emergency has come up this time. Being able to keep track of these requirements is a must. You’ll need to be able to plan both in the short term (today’s chaos) and the long term (what is our 4 year development plan?). This is where the typical scientific background, with its multitasking of experiments, writing, and meetings, really comes in handy.

**Managing**

The job title is *Regulatory Affairs Manager*, and so it’s fairly clear that there’s management involved. But it’s not ‘management’ in the sense of having people reporting to you and doing the tasks you assign them (well, not until later at least). Instead it’s managing people without actually having any formal authority over them – you can’t give orders, you’ll have to persuade, wheedle, nag, bargain, compromise and trade your way to your goals. This is not to say that people won’t want to help you, but each expert you approach will have a ridiculous number of demands on their time. Why should they help you? You need to be persuasive, and this is why interpersonal skills are one of the main talents HR looks for when hiring.

**Writing dossier modules**

Want approval to market your miracle drug? First you need to show that you know what you’re doing – that your product is safe, effective, and made in a (consistently) high-quality way. This is done via the *dossier*, a vast document split into numerous sections covering every stage of the development process and the future plans. As you’d expect, working on a product’s dossier takes up a lot of time. Whether it’s putting together the initial application or making updates to a previously-approved one, a regulatory career will revolve around the dossier. 

**Working with source documents**

This is a pretty big change for people coming in from academia or research: you’re done with laboratory work. Others within the company will be doing protein analysis, clinical studies, purity checks – that’s not your job any more. Instead, you’ll take the work produced by these people (studies and reports), and use that as a basis for their own writing. You still need experience dealing with scientific data and methods (to understand what you are reading!), but the data is produced by others. Your job is to understand these source documents so that you can decide how much of it ends up in the dossier.

**Providing regulatory advice**

You aren’t just reading reports and writing dossiers. Because companies are always changing their methods (trying to optimise for cost and yield), you’ll be part of the change evaluation process – saying how much regulatory stress is involved in any given change. That clever idea to increase yields by a few percent is less worthwhile when the FDA demands several years of stability data first. Likewise, your advice will be needed to plan these changes. What will be needed to get approval for your drug? What kind of studies will be needed in the final submission? This is where regulatory affairs comes in.

*Kind of interesting?*

medicine,Distinguishing between left visual neglect and left homonymous hemianopia in right TACS?,"Hi! My understanding of a right total anterior circulation stroke is that it requires all three of the following (presuming patient is alert):

1. Left sided face, UL, LL weakness (LL weakness may be less)

2. Cortical signs (in this case left hemineglect, often accompanied by Prevost sign in which the eyes deviate left, possibly also visual agnosias)

3. Left homonymous hemianopia.

What I'm not too sure about is how the left hemineglect manifests, and whether this affects testing for the left homonymous hemianopia.

Q1: If a patient has a left hemineglect *without* optic tract/ radiation lesions, can we distinguish this from a patient who has both left hemineglect and a true left homonymous hemianopia?

Q2: In a patient with Prevost gaze deviation, does the field of hemineglect ""move"" with it? Or if for example a patient with left hemineglect but no Prevost deviation and no visual field defects turns his head to the right, will he be able to see more/ experience more of the world?

pharmacy,Quality of pharmacy students on rotation (P4s),"So I've had at least 4 students come through my hospital on rotation that make me weep for the future of this profession. Here are a few examples of interactions with students who are literally a few months from being called ""Doctor"":

*One student stated that men cannot take a prenatal multivitamin since it has ""hormones in it""

*One student asked me how to use a pill cutter (he literally held it up to me with a confused look on his face)

*A student stated that nitrofurantoin was for ""skin infections"" upon doing a little teaching moment when she was watching me counsel

*After watching me verify meds for ~20 minutes, a student I had shadowing me asked me if I was a pharmacist (we had only been introduced by name prior to this)

medicine,Severe DKA in pt w/ EF &lt;30% question,"Im a medicine resident and was consulted on a patient who was in DKA essentially my question boils down to at what point would you dialyze this patient ie looking for nephrology and ER. 

Pt presented in DKA BG 44 (mmol/L or 800mg/dl), BHB 17 AGAP 44 HCO3 6.

Pt had only received minimal fluids (500cc NS) due to her low EF and risk of fluid overload. 

I assessed the pt and discussed w/ the ED doc the case as the pt was way too sick for the ward and I felt ICU was warranted but that they should also speak with Nephrology. 

Only had VBGs to go by but two consecutive:
pH 7.1 CO2 21 HCO3 9  --&gt;
pH 6.8 CO2 31 HCO3 6

Vitally BP stable, tachycardic 1teens, and ++tachypneic. Pt has a normal Cr. 

I suggested Bipap but also that they would probably benefit from dialysis given the inability to fluid resuscitate as well as the profound academia that clearly was not getting better. 

Just your thoughts! Much appreciated. 

edit: insulin infusion was running appropriately

2nd edit: I only briefly saw the patient as they obviously required MICU. The pt was definitely dry and needed more fluid but I wasn't the staff/person handing out the orders. Also complicating things they did not want CPR or intubation as they were elderly and had multiple other comorbidities. 

edit 3: seems most people here who have pts w DKA go to MICU. Is this the standard for you guys? Where I am they regularly come to the ward unless requiring ventilatory support or profoundly acidotic (even then sometimes). 

edit 4 and final: thanks for all the help! The pt did go to ICU, I was only briefly part of the care but was curious should this arise again. The bipap was suggested because the pt was tiring out not because they were already in edema. They had a hx of COPD and after MICU arrived they also had a pneumonia.

medicine,Family doctors of Reddit: which procedures do you perform routinely?,"I am a 4th year med student trying to accurately visualize my future and could use some help. After much internal struggle, I have decided to pursue a family medicine residency following medical school; most likely in a rural setting.  I was also very interested in General surgery, GI, and Derm because I very much enjoy procedures. In the end, I found that I could not give up one specialty for another and my hope is that if I become a generalist, I can focus my practice around procedures from all these specialties. Maybe have a room set up for minor Derm stuff, gain credentials to have an upper and lower scope day, perform joint injections...that sort of thing.  

So my question  1.) is this possible and feasible?  2.) what are common procedures that family docs perform that are worth your time doing vs sending them to a specialist?  3.) should I pursue a different specialty that would better prepare me?
