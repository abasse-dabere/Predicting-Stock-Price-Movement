Health,Excruciating stomach pain. Anyone had anything similar?,"Over the weekend I went away with my family to help my brother move. On the Saturday evening on the ride back I got a severe pain in the stomach area above the belly button. I could barely speak or breathe from the pain. This lasted about 5 mins max and the suddenly subsided and I was fine again.

Fast forward to 4am Sunday morning and I get awoken by some more stomach pain which I assumed was indigestion so I got up and had some water with bicarbonate of soda hoping that would expel any trapped gas. The pain then became extremely worse and way more so than Sunday evening. It was, in fact, the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. I lay on the floor unable to walk and in absolute agony. I made my way up to my mum's room and collapsed on her bed. I was then shouting in pain and begged her to call an ambulance. I then proceeded to throw up all over the floor which did not seem to make the pain go away. I was sweating profusely and was very hot. I then made my way outside onto the driveway in my boxers a was lying on the drive way doubled up, as my folks were about to get in the car to take me to A&amp;E. That is when all of a sudden within about 30 seconds the pain just went.

Sunday mid-day I went to the Doctors who told me it could be an infection but nothing too helpful. He felt my abdominal area for any tenderness but there was nothing. I informed him I was vegan and have eaten nothing but healthy foods with plenty of fruit and veg and lots of water. On the Friday evening I did go for a vegetarian curry with my family so he suggested it could be food poisoning, but that was Friday early evening and this pain came about early Sunday morning. I would have thought I would have digested it all by then and my family ate the same thing with no issues. The restaurant also had a good reputation so I think it's safe to rule that out. I have not felt sick or had any irregular bowel movements. I am going for a blood test later in the week, as advised, just to make sure it is nothing serious.

I just wanted to know if anyone has had anything similar and if so could give any advice. My worst fear is that it is going to happen again and I don't want to experience anything like this ever again.",14.0,8,2013-07-01,PHARMA,0.09383264929056168,0.8773831725120544,0.02878420241177082
pharmacy,Zostavax: what you tell patients,"Frequently I had patients come in who ask about the shingles vaccine.  I have lots of patients who claim to have never had chicken pox (or so they think).  They ask if a person who has never had chicken pox can get the shingles because so many of them think they have never had chicken pox.  The answer is no, you cannot get shingles if you have not had chicken pox.  What I tell them is they should get it anyways because over 99% (according to the vaccines.gov) of Americans over the age of 40 have been infected with the chicken pox even if they were unaware of it when they were younger.  The case could have been so mild that they were unaware of it at the time.

Health,"My chest and left shoulder/arm hurt, and when I lay down, I start breathing heavily and I don't know what to do and it's really scaring me.","It started last Saturday night (June 22), and then it was a little pain, like a slap. Over the week, it's gotten worse. Every time I go to lay down, my chest hurts (middle) and I start breathing heavily, like after taking a run when you haven't for a while. 

My shoulder started hurting Saturday the 29th after I woke up. I thought I slept on it wrong, but almost 2 days later it should be gone by now, but hasn't. At the moment, it feels like an arm should after getting a shot at the doctors.

Feel free to ask questions to try and narrow it down.

Edit: After a few minutes, the pain in my chest goes away and I start breathing normally (though my nose is my way of breathing) like nothing happened. The only pain I have is my shoulder/arm, like I just had a shot.

Edit: I haven't seen the doctor yet. I have an appointment tomorrow.

Edit 3: I'm on my way to urgent care right now, and I'll keep you guys updated.

Edit 4: Ok so my mom and I went to urgent care yesterday [June 1 (don't know why it's called 'urgent' care if i had to wait 2 hours)], and the doctor listened to my chest, stomach, back and said it sounded fine. So he sent me to the radiology department to get an x-ray of my chest. He said my lungs looked fine, so he got a nurse to get me a breathing treatment of albuterol (sp?) and that didn't help much. He sent me to the lab to draw blood (they gave me Toy Story 3 sticker. It's pretty kick-ass) for 3 tests. The first was blood cell count, with good results, the second was for amount of minerals in my blood, w/good results. The third one is to see if it's linked to JRA, which I had as a child, but they'll call when they get results. The doctor gave me a prescription to prednisone for a few days.",8.0,5,2013-07-01,PHARMA,0.04851564019918442,0.9106531143188477,0.04083118960261345

medicine,Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome,"I'm reading some journal articles for school about FAI, and defining and treating this condition seems all over the place. From what I can decipher, FAI is classified into cam, pincer, or mixed type deformities, which pretty much adds up to how the femur head doesn't quite fit into the acetabulum as a perfect ball and socket joint. Signs and symptoms include hip pain radiating into the groin and adductor region, and a positive ""impingement sign"" where flexion and internal rotation of the hip can create pain. Also, because of the deformity, there is supposedly increased incidences of labrum tears and wearing out cartilage earlier.  

However, there are controversies to diagnosing and treating the condition. For example, some studies use alpha angles to define positive findings on radiography (especially for cam deformities), while others use femoral head and neck ratios (I think its for cam and pincer types), while still others use a combination of clinical presentation and radiographic findings. Some articles say there is an association between FAI and osteoarthritis, while other articles are less inclined to associate the two conditions. And most of the articles on treatment and outcome were extremely limited case controlled studies with short term follow up, with some advocating arthroscopic labrum repair only, arthroscopic labrum repair and remodeling of the femoral head or acetabulum, and some saying we should just treat the condition as an early form of OA and do a hip replacement when conservative treatment fails. It all seems like a confusing mess to me. 

Can any orthopods/sports med/radiology docs help define FAI and its significance? Thanks in advance.

I asked about night sweats and those were dismissed as ""if it's real night sweat you can't stop them by changing room/lowering temperature"". Also it turns out the nodes are not supraclavical, it's posterior cervical - which is marginally less ominous.**

**I'm still not fully convinced, but I'll be satisfied that I'm not going to drop dead soon and I'll be seeking a second opinion with my family doctor in 2 weeks when we have our first meeting.**

I'm male, 27 yrs old.

Near the end of the winter, at the beginning of the year, I've started hard-core exercising with long jogs and pushup and situps mixed in.

I've started to eat late on many occasion (9-10pm) due to getting off work late (6pm) and then exercise and recoup for around 2 hours and slowly increased my level of exercise.

However for the past 1-2 months I've started to have occasional night sweats (l think 5-6 times, never consecutively). At first I don't even know they are a problem, but 2 weeks ago I had another episode which causes me to think it isn't normal and started Googling.

I immediately found out that it could be cancer, infection, or hormone changes for women and men in their late 40-50s.

So of course, I immediately felt up and down for lumps and GASP, found 2 on my neck, in the supraclavical area (base of neck), a jelly bean sized (left) and a M&amp;M sized (right), oval shaped, firm (hard-ish, I rather not squeeze hard on them) and smooth lump that seems to be connected to tissues underneath, but is loose enough to move around when trying to poke it.

No pain, no discomfort.

This scared the crap out of me and I immediately went to the doctor and got blood test and chest X-ray done; now waiting for results.

In the meantime I found out I had eye infection for quite a while now - I just thought I got dry eyes; and I got anti-biotic eye drop for them. I dared to hope it was due to my eye infection, but my gut is telling me painless, firm lumps coupled with night sweats is a ominous sign.

I have lost 3kg in the past week, I think it's purely anxiety related.

I ate a lot less, isn't digesting well and I had been working out feverishly in an attempt to calm down and to prepare myself to what I'm convinced was a fight for my life ahead.

I've had no night sweat at all since then, but I start to feel hot and feverish (no fever though) in the night and I have trouble sleeping - I think it's hot weather (27c in my room) plus anxiety. At least I hope it is anxiety related - I don't want it to be some kind of aggressive symptom.

I have been reading on the internet and I have to force myself to stop. But when I stop reading the fear of unknown kicks in instead.

People are telling me it's going to be all right, but my mind refuses to listen. Everything I've read made it scream ""suspicious!!!!""

My test results is due back today or next week. My mind is in shambles.",6.0,4,2013-07-05,PHARMA,0.16865572333335876,0.8056635856628418,0.02568071521818638

It's been a nuisance for awhile, but lately it's been affecting her mood and getting in the way of her life. It keeps her up every night. She can sleep for maybe a half hour at a time, but the discomfort wakes her up and keeps her up. She winds up lying in bed rolling around or getting up and walking around all night until she can finally sleep for about three hours. Because of this, she spends 12-14 hours in bed per day. It's been stressing her out a lot, but she doesn't have the money to see a doctor about it.

She's not on any medications, and we don't really drink coffee or alcohol very often. Everyone that she's talked to recommended that establishing a better sleep schedule will help. The issue IS that she can't sleep.

When we first started dating, I didn't like using condoms and would pull out. After a few weeks, she wasn't feeling too well and wanted to take a pregnancy test. The second line was faintly pink, but definitely there. So she took 3 more and they all had the same results: a faint pink second line.

So she went to the gyno without me, but in hindsight, I'm not too sure she did. She claimed the doctor said she miscarried and her body hadn't yet flushed her uterus, so they gave her antibiotics (which I never saw her take) and didn't request a follow-up appointment (I didn't find this out until two months later.)

So we start using condoms and everything seems fine. Two weeks ago, she says she wants to try another pregnancy test just to see what it says. 6 pregnancy tests later, and the same faint pink line is there. It hasn't darkened at all. She hasn't gained any weight in these five months, and I saw a pic of her at 5 months with her first kid and she was pretty big, then. 

I don't believe she's pregnant. I think she was too scared to go to the doctor originally, lied, and hoped it would just go away (this is its own issue which I'll deal with once I know she's okay). For whatever reason though, she seems to have the same level of HCG in her urine as she did 5 months ago. Google tells me this could be anything from an ovarian cyst to uterus/ovarian/cervical cancer. She's worried as shit (as am I) and can't even sleep, so I was wondering if someone had heard of something similar.

Now the other end of the collarbone has separated from my sternum, and it's truly busted. I'm a glassblower, or WAS, because without the use of my left arm, my career is over. I will move anywhere to get it fixed as soon as possible, but it may be too late.

medicine,CRO - does a confirmed case in a HCP mean the end of a career?,"Background - UK anaesthetist.

Quick chat from our Microbiology boys today during our audit meeting; in essence CROs (Carbapenem Resistant Organisms) have just started to light up on hospital radars here in the UK.

During this chat they covered a few topics; for those of you like myself who have forgotten the majority of our Infectious Diseases medical school stuff I'll summarise it here

1) no current decolonisation regime

2) CRO transmitted via plasmid exchange to other G -ve bacterium

3) Intermittent shedding of these bacteria means that the stance our Micro guys take is ""once infected - infected permanently""

Out of interest I asked Micro on their stance should a HCP acquire CRO. They said that this would effectively mandate (as they generously put it) *""significant absence from hospital areas""* that *""may not be recoverable""*.

Hmmm.... 

And so I ask the title question of you all here - particularly focused on US/Indian/Sri Lankan folk (as I believe CROs are endemic in some areas of your respective nations). What're the options should a HCP have a confirmed case?",13.0,7,2013-07-11,PHARMA,0.030692387372255325,0.9317626357078552,0.03754498437047005

Health,My brain sometimes starts spewing random nonsense. Is there a name for this?,"Hi!

Psychology question here.

In the context of a severe depression, one of the most limiting symptoms is that my brain sometimes starts losing focus to an extreme degree. I get dizzy and vertigo, completely dadaesque thoughts appear in my brain, sometimes forcibly derailing legitimate ones. That can also happen to actions. I lose focus to the point of wandering off somewhere else a lot - like an extreme version of constantly ending up in front of the fridge. For another example, I'm constantly looking back up at the screen to make sure my fingers still hit the right patterns, even though I was a fast and secure typist half a year ago, now they sometimes end up spelling random strings or words or completely screw up the orthography. I also sometimes lose the ability to comprehend what I'm looking at - everything just suddenly makes no sense any more for a few seconds, like a random accumulation of geometric shapes.

Was is even more striking is the way my dreams work now - they are completely random, sometimes to a terrifying degree. Half a year ago, when the depression was lighter I loved sleeping because I would dream what felt like amazingly constructed, hour long movie-like plots. Now, while there is often an underlying theme, there is no consistency - I end up being teleported, time keeps skipping and rewinding, things are replaced by completely wrong objects without anyone acknowledging it, my actions are completely random without me even remembering that inside the dream (feels like the psychotic rages I had during my last episode), and more things like that.

Is there a name for this? The condition is both terrifying due to the dreams and the fact that I constantly fear losing control in public, and very fascinating, so I'd like to read about it.

I have been having reactions like this to apples, oranges, and tomatoes since my freshman year of college (for 5 years).  For about a year, I tried denying it and continued to eat those things and (of course) continued to have the reaction.  Since that point, I have been trying very hard to cut those foods out of my diet.  My mouth had been clear for quite some time, but it has recently flared up again. I've gone to allergists and dermatologists, but everyone just shrugs it off.  The reaction has gotten more intense over time and it seems like I am having reactions even when I know that I didn't eat any of my trigger foods.  It is incredibly painful.

Health,7 years of chronic fatigue and still going :(,"tl;dr
Have had very little energy for the past 7 years
doctors have no idea why.

the story:
Have had chronic fatigue for 7 or 8 years (27 now), it sucks really really bad. Hardly ever have any energy at all. Sometimes sleep 12-18 hours a day. Taking naps even after sleeping 12+ hours through the night. Started out a diagnosis of Mono but never really went away. Doctors said the virus sometimes just sticks around.

Trying to get ""treatment"" and opinions from doctors on why I still have this in the past year has been really frustrating for a variety of reasons.

Starting with a more naturalistic doc, got a blood test and she noted my testosterone was quite low. Also warned of Black Mold in my house, which I highly suspect I have since there is a lot of water damage to our roof. 

Was referred to another doctor who mainly dealt with testosterone treatment and he said I would feel much better once I got it up over 800 (although I think the norm is somewhere around 350). First series of injections (3 months long) was to try and get my body to make testosterone naturally, via injections twice a week of HCG to my stomach (get in mah belly!). After that treatment was over my testosterone was half of what is was before. So then I was put on course of pure testosterone injections (in the buttocks this time. Ha, ""buttocks""). 

After doing 2/3rds of the testosterone injections I still wasn't feeling any better at all. So I went to my primary doctor and he thought my lack of energy might be due to allergies, so he referred me to an allergist but also recommended me to a urologist. Allergist was really cool and helped me out with my bad allergies, but I still had chronic fatigue/no energy.

Urologist said my testosterone was fine and highly recommended quitting the injections immediately to avoid permanent damage (mostly my baby making abilities, which I don't care about at all, I want to get a vasectomy anyways). Didn't really offer any opinions on to what was causing my great lack of energy, though.

So, a lot of injections, a lot of money spent, a lot of blood tests, a lot of time seemingly wasted. That's just from this past year, not mentioning all the other doctor visits I've had in the past 7 years.

The ""solution"" I have the most faith in is the black mold all over my room/house hiding in the roof is what is causing all the problems. But even of that I'm very skeptical. Looks a lot like a health scare scam. ""Black Mold, the silent killer!"". The main website for it (surviving mold dot com) charges $10 just to look at the frequently asked questions, and they have an online screening test to see if you're affected, but they charge $15 to take that test. Definitely looks like a money grab. I dunno though, it wouldn't hurt to get my crappy roof fixed and see if it makes a difference to my well being.

Health,"I just had the weirdest experience....do hemorrhoids detach? Maybe it was a cyst? I dunno, details inside. I'm weirded out!","I'm 34, never had any major health problems in my intestine or anus, ever.  Sunday night I noticed my anus hurt badly.  It felt sore, like I'd stretched out my sphincter or something.  I'd had food poisoning the week before that had come out that end, so I figured maybe I just pushed too hard and pulled something?  I dunno, I wasn't sure.  I don't have insurance, so a doctor/hospital is out of the question.  I'm still in massive debt from a kidney stone a year and a half ago.

The pain persisted the next few days.  When I went to the bathroom I noticed it didn't hurt to poop, but whatever was sore hurt more when I clenched my anus than when I pushed out.  In the shower, I felt around...found something swollen.  It wasn't inside or on the sphincter, it was just above it.  So I looked up symptoms online, and it seemed like I'd had my first external hemorrhoid.  The pain was easing up though, so I thought it was going away.  I've made sure to clean the area extra every time I've showered.

It's now wednesday night at 4am.  I work at a bar, so I just got home, was all sweaty, and decided to take a shower when I got home.  I went to scrub my anus (gently so as not to irritate anything), and I noticed it was...well, I don't know how to phrase this NOT grossly, but it was slimy.  I figured it was just sweat from work, so I cleaned it until it felt like normal skin.  

Then I looked down.  On the floor of the shower was this dime sized...mass.  It looked like blood, only solidified.  I picked it up out of curiosity, and it was tough, solid, not a gel.  It was then that I noticed...my anus didn't hurt anymore.  No pain whatsoever.  I took the glob and looked at it in the bright sink lights, and it was solid tissue, or at least looked that way.  I flushed it, and immediately came here.  I'm literally typing this still wet with a towel around me.

What the heck came out of my butt?!   Was it a hemorrhoid?  A cyst?  Something else?  I'm not freaking out here, cause I'm not in any pain anymore...but I am a little weirded out!  Kinda regretting not taking a picture of the glob for you guys to analyze, but...I described it pretty well, I think.

medicine,"Residents and attendings of Reddit, how many of you just got by in medical school, and did it impact your confidence and enjoyment of medicine? Does it get better? (MS4 in crisis.)","EM Hopeful here.  Got a Pass from my home institution in EM that is based almost entirely on evaluations.  With a comment that stated I had knowledge gaps.  

I have to admit, I am pretty bummed.  I left the rotation feeling like I had done better than pass-quality work, and that I had come across in my interactions with my evaluators as appropriately knowledgeable, but the people evaluating me disagreed and it's just a serious blow to my confidence. I used to be able to rationalize my sea of P's with the knowledge that in other clerkships, test scores make the grade, and I know I don't take tests particularly well.  What kills me is that this rotation's grade is based almost entirely on evaluations, which have historically been a strong point for me, and I still only passed.   I'm concerned about being found deficient by people in the specialty I've chosen.  At this point, it's not even about whether or not I'll match.  My worry is that I won't ever be as good as I need to be to care for patients well and to feel good about my work.

Has anyone else who underperformed in medical school felt this way?  My confidence is shot to shreds, and I feel so inadequate relative to my peers.  Will that ever resolve?

Health,Stomach issue = Stomach Virus?,"Back story: I have anxiety, and panic attacks. I've been to the ER for gall stones and heart issues in the past 2 months. Everything checks out just fine.

Medications i'm on: Lexapro 5mg daily, Wellbutrin SR 100mg twice daily

Symptoms: Nausea, loss of appetite, lost 10 pounds in a week, lack of energy. I went to the Dr about those symptoms last week, and thats when i was diagnosed with Genral Anxiety, saying that's why i had those symptoms.

Last Tuesday i felt great, then after i ate dinner i had almost immediate diarrhea. Nothing to worry about, but because it was dark green, the anxiety kicked in and i started to panic. I went to bed. I woke up the next morning, again dark green diarrhea. Then the nausea came back, lack of appetite, fatigued, and now i have a stomach ache.

I make an appointment with my MD, but i had to wait until Friday.
Thursday and Friday, i was pretty much constipated. I had to strain and hardly anything came out but at least it was brown again. Just a couple of thin brown snakes. Dr said i just have a stomach virus and it'll pass in a few days up to a week. Ok, great, nothing big. He said it's the stomach virus, which is making my anxiety spike, which isn't helping with the symptoms.

Last night i took lots of fiber, hoping to pass something, and hopefully a lot of something. I just want this out of me. I woke up this morning and had to go to the bathroom. I went, and looked. It was pale/clayish  mixed with brownish yellow. color, and it had a couple spots of red blood.

Is this a sign of a stomach virus? or something more serious? There wasn't a whole lot of blood, just a couple of red spots on the outside of the outside of it. Not enough to make the water turn color. Could this just be an anal fissure or a hemorrhoid or something caused by the straining of constipation the past couple of days?

If you don't know what spot I am describing, sit down on the toilet or on the edge of your bed and lean to the left. That spot where the pressure is, is making my leg completely numb and causing pain.

Health,19F about to have a tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy. Nervous.,"Thursday I go for the surgery. I have had three different doctors tell me that my tonsils are chronically infected and I need to have them out ASAP and that it should have been done years ago. I have tonsillitis and strep B at least four times a year, and I am constantly sick. Being already immunosupressed due to my rheumatoid arthritis and medications to treat it, my tonsils have added to the issue. I joke and tell people if someone sneezes five miles away and I am downwind, I will catch their.illness. I catch EVERYTHING. The ENT specialist I saw last Tuesday said I may also have fewer kidney infections after the surgery.  

  Enough rambling. The only other surgery I have had was oral surgery (wisdom teeth extraction) at 16, so I am very nervous. They also said recovery is very painful, especially in adults. I am very nervous. Has anyone undergone the surgery as an adult? How did it go? How painful was the aftermath? Did it help you? What can I expect? Is there anything I should know or ask the doctor?

pharmacy,"Can pharmacists from Calgary, Alberta, or any other provinces in Canada please advise a US citizen with a pharmacy degree how to become a pharmacist in Canada?","Hi.  I am trying to find out information to help two family members so that they can help me.  One has a BS in Pharmacy from the Philippines and is not licensed in the USA but has US citizenship.

The other has a a Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) from the University of Georgia but is not licensed either.  

What would be the best place to start to look for information about becoming licensed in Calgary, Alberta?  

What is the procedure?  

Is a residency required?

I understand that one's pharmacy degree has to be evaluated by the PEBC, and that PEBC exams must be passed, but then what?

As far as transcripts from the University of Georgia, where would they be sent to?  PEBC?  Would Alberta also have an office that would require official transcripts to be mailed to?

Does anyone have experience with a similar situation or advice?

Is Calgary still the best city to find work?

What exactly is the 1000 hours of Structured Practical Training?  How would a US citizen go about this internship?

Thanks in advance for any helpful posts.  Any personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Health,Is the chance of inheriting early onset Alzheimer's really 50%?,"My grandfather had the disease.  I never knew him as a person, just the man who couldn't speak who walked around and we had to watch him all the time so he wouldn't walk off.

It killed him at 59.

I think that constitutes ""early onset.""

I knew that it's possibly inherited, and today I read some Reddit thread about it, so for the heck of it I looked up what the inherited chances are.

According to [this site](http://www.mindinmemorycare.com/2011/06/13/the-fear-of-inheriting-alzheimers-disease/), 50/50.

Okay, that actually terrified me.  I had absolutely no idea.  Does that mean my mother has a coin-flip's chance of being in diapers by the time she's 55?  Does that mean *I* have a quarter of a chance of that?  If my mother doesn't get it, are my chances *still* 1/4, or am I much safer?

I just want someone to tell me that website must be wrong, that there's no way.  Because my grandfather had three children, and each one had three children.  Does that mean that the odds are at least one of my aunts (along with my mother) will die from it by around 65, and that it could then extend into my generation of cousins and siblings?

I know there is no definitive answer, but I feel like my casual googling of ""chances of inheriting early onset alzheimers"" became a death sentence in the worst possible way for *at least* several people in my family, including myself.

I swear to god if I am ever diagnosed I would prefer death.  I am being totally serious.

Sorry if that took a dark turn, but I'm suddenly in a very bad mood, and at least that wouldn't happen until somewhere between 30-60 for me, if at all.",1.0,5,2013-07-30,PHARMA,0.1585310995578766,0.817564845085144,0.023903997614979744

Health,"Went to ER for MRSA, he squeezed it and made it worse... what should I do?","I tend to get MRSA quite frequently due to having Crohns and being on remicade.  I developed an abscess on my back and lymph nodes in that side's arm pit are super swollen.  When I went to the ER, he literally just squeezed it (without numbing it and nothing came out) then gave me scrips for antibiotics.  Normally, to have these treated I have to receive a dose of IV antibiotics then they have to cut it open and drain it.  I have never had one get better from just getting oral antibiotics without draining it.  Now, it's gotten about 3x bigger and my back is really hot to the touch.  It also hurts really, REALLY bad and now I'm throwing up and I have a HORRIBLE headache...  Should I go to a different ER?  Like now?

[Picture of back](http://i.imgur.com/V0yOIka.jpg)  Please ignore shitty ink... a mistake from 8 years ago.  Just because you drew it and it has meaning to you doesn't mean it isn't every goth girl's college mistake.

FOLLOWUP:  I went back to the ER, my pulse was 130 and my temp was 100.5.  They gave me IV antibiotics and something for the pain while I was there.  If I don't keep down my antibiotics I have to be admitted... but I'm not throwing up as much anymore so I may be able to avoid that.  He didn't want to lance it because when the other doctor squeezed the abscess, it created new pockets of bacteria so he would have had to make around 3 cuts... which would open up a chance for a worse infection.  They pretty much said the doctor before screwed up... it was right at shift change and he just wanted to leave.

Health,Problems with inability to gain weight,"Hello reddit!

So, first off, I want you all to know that I am seeing doctors and such, the problem is we have hit a wall. So I figured I would chime in here and see if anyone has any thoughts or suggestuions, or perhaps ideas I could bring back to my doctor that they might have missed.

Here is what is going on. I am 24 years old, male, 5'11"" weigh 120 pounds and have 0.6% body fat.

I am a toned individual, and moderately excercise via calesthenics. However, due to years working with the military, my lower back is constantly in pain, and I have other random physical ailments that pop up. Symptoms such as my right side going completely numb, sudden instantaneous muscle failure in the abdominal region (being able to rock rns and situps one day, literally can't do a sit up the next). Consistant back pain, sky high heart rates (after a few minutes of activity my heart rate is averaging 180boms, can spike all the way into the 220's

If I find myself in any heavy strenuous activites, my body physically HAS to go to sleep. If I say do sprints, when I am done, I must go pass out. 

My doctors have given me MRI's, CT scans, fat absorption tests, a million and one blod tests, and everything comes back normal. They have me working with a dietician now, and refuse to try and do any more tests for a few months. The problem is this has been going on for two years, and I am starting to see a very large impact on my job being in the military.

The dietician has put me on a 3,000 calorie a day diet. It is incredibly hard for me to eat this much, but I have been trudging along and trying my best to do so. Over the alst month I would say I am on average a 2500 a day person, though many days I will meet the 3,000. Some days I don't even get 2,000 though.

Since I started the diet, I still havn't seen any results. I have been this weight since I was a teenager though.

I am tired of feeling sick, being in pain, and being underweight. Is there any tests, or suggestions you might all have to help me out?

TL;DR: Help a 24year old male, 5'11, 120lb 0.6% body fat individual gain weight when nothing seems to work and all tests have came back negative.",13.0,4,2013-07-31,PHARMA,0.15765631198883057,0.811432957649231,0.030910689383745193
