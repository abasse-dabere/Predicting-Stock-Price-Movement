Health,I'm a 24 year old male who's constantly tired with no medical diagnosis. Help?,"Hey Reddit.

I'm a bit stuck. For the past few years I've been constantly tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I wake up around 6:00am each weekday morning and get to sleep around 10-10:30pm, but even if I get more sleep I still wake up tired.

I went to the doctors and they did blood/urine tests and a medical exam through which nothing unusual was observed apart from a very slight, insignificant heart murmur (they sent me to a specialist for further tests and he determined that it was nothing to worry about).

The only thing that they suggested to me was my diet, which they didn't actually give me any help with. This was about a year ago and I've tried to change my diet to help but to be honest I have no idea what I'm even meant to be doing with it.

So, apart from any diet advice, does anyone have any experience of this or any other advice? And yes, I have tried coffee/energy drinks but they don't seem to have any effect on me and if anything they're a temporary workaround.

Thanks!

Health,Are there any particular complications that may affect overweight folks getting the flu vaccine (shot)?,"I'm not trying to pull a McCarthy here, and am well aware that correlation does not equal causation, just trying to gain a little understanding.

This morning I received word that a buddy of mine was found dead in his home.  He was late 40's, morbidly obese (probably 6'2"", 400-450lbs) but still pretty mobile and steady health.  I saw him on Sunday and he was a mess...his skin seemed a bit 'dark', he was disheveled and a bit groggy/disoriented.  He said he had received a flu shot at work on Thursday, felt 'off' on Friday and things had gradually deteriorated since then.  I was around him for a couple of hours, and by the time we parted, he seemed to be regaining a bit of energy...but was still clearly hurting.

Apparently he spoke with his parents on Monday and tried to go to work (not sure if he was successful).  He spoke with them again on Tuesday, still not feeling well, but not congested or anything...just weak and tired.  His boss called his parents Thursday morning saying they hadn't seen him, so the parents went over to his place and found him sitting in a chair.  The coroner said he had probably passed Tuesday night.

The family isn't getting an autopsy performed, so I don't think there will ever be any conclusive evidence of a particular cause of death.  Given the man's weight and age, he was obviously a candidate for a heart attack at any given time.  It's just that I've known the guy for nearly 10 years and aside from a blown out knee and some sleep apnea issues, he kept plodding along.

Health,"Reddit, about a week ago I posted about my gf who is sick for unknown reasons. After heeding your advice, I have an update.","Last week I posted about how my gf was very sick and no doctor could figure out what was wrong. Reddit stepped in and suggested Kounis syndrome, Churg-Strauss, and Takayasu Arteritis. Folks on Reddit also suggested that I take my gf to a teaching hospital, such as UCSF or Stanford. 


Last Sunday, my gf started to have a lot of chest pain and needed to go to the ER. I took a risk and decided to take her to UCSF without preapproval from Kaiser. She had elevated troponin levels, so UCSF got Kaiser to pay for her treatment in the ER. Kaiser then requested that she be transferred to their hospital in San Francisco, but UCSF refused because they said my gf was not well enough for transport. Kaiser then agreed to pay for my gf’s stay at UCSF. Phew! 


The next day (she was admitted Sunday night), I mentioned the elusive Kounis syndrome to her cardiologist at UCSF. He was aware of it, but said that my gf’s medical history suggests that it wouldn’t be Kounis syndrome. He didn’t elaborate on what specifically led him to that conclusion, though. Vasculitis or ateritis were suspected. An order for a myocardial biopsy was put in (despite the obvious risks) to be done same day. The biopsy went well. After the biopsy was performed, Kaiser called UCSF saying that they would not pay for any treatment beyond the biopsy. My gf would either need to be transferred to Kaiser, or discharged. We opted to have her rest until the next morning (Tuesday), and then be discharged. 


Wednesday night we had to go back to the ER for chest pain. We went to Kaiser in Oakland, and had a unbelievably terrible experience (possibly even negligence on Kaiser’s part), which I can describe more fully if there is an interest. Long story short, gf had a minor NSTEMI (non ST elevated myocardial infarction/heart attack) and breathing difficulty/asthma/wheezing. She was given intravenous Diltiazem and Solu-cortef and nebulized Albuterol. She was stabilized and discharged several hours later, at 5 AM. 


Thursday night, again, back to ER (Kaiser Richmond—never, ever going to Kaiser Oakland again). This time for asthma only (no chest pain). She was given 60 mg of Prednisone and some kind of steroid in her nebulizer treatment. She had a number of blood tests done:

* **Neutrophils %:** 35  *(normal range according to Kaiser is 50 – 70)*
* **Lymphocytes %:** 16 *(“ 20 -50)*
* **Monos %:** 4 *(“ 1 – 11)*
* **Eosinophils %:** 45  *(“ 1 – 5)*
* **RBC’s, morphology:** Normal
* **Platelets:** Adequate
* **WBC Count:** 15.4 *(“ 3.5 – 12.5)*
* **Red blood cells count:** 4.70 *(“ 3.60 – 5.70)*
* **Hgb:** 12.5 *(“ 11.5 – 15.0)*
* **Hematocrit:** 36.8 *(“ 34.0 – 46.0)*
* **MCV:** 78 *(“ 80 – 100)*
* **RDW, RBC:** 13.2 *(“ 12.0 – 16.5)*
* **Platelets count:** 266 *(“ 140 – 400)*
* **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate:** 42 *(“ 0 – 20)*
* **CRP (C-reactive protein):** 0.3 *(“ &lt; 0.5)*
* **Rheumatoid factor:** 60.1 *(“ &lt;14.0)*
* **C4 Complement:** 37.0 *(“ 10 – 40)*
* **C3 Complement:** 130 *(“ 83 – 180)*
* **ANA (Antinuclear Antibody):** Negative
* **IgE, QN:** 382 *(“ 0 – 130)*

She was not admitted in Richmond; discharged very early (2 am or so) Friday morning. Friday midmorning she had an appointment with her primary care physician in Richmond. Her PCP suggested going back to ER for her asthma, which she didn’t. That evening, her asthma worsened and I took her to Kaiser San Francisco at her request, hoping yet another new set of doctors might be able to shed some light on what’s going on. She was admitted, given Prednisone, Morphine, and Solumetrol. Prednisone seems to help with her chest pain now (she’s taking 60 mg), but it causes her to be extremely itchy all over all day and all night, so she’s just as miserable as before.


It’s now Sunday morning, and she’s being discharged because the myocardial biopsy had no abnormalities.

Health,Possible tetanus?,"Hi /r/Health.
I'm a 19 year old youth who is in a low income situation and am not insured. I scraped my left shoulder on a rusty bar from a metal grating that is small air conditioner is housed in. It wasn't that bad of a wound, although it formed a small scab I shook it off because it scraped my shirt, but hard enough to cause said bleeding/scab. It has been a week since the incident and no major symptoms have occurred other than some recent left arm and neck stiffness. I don't know if I'm exaggerating this stiffness. 

Anyway my questions are,

Should I go get it checked out?

It's been a week so if I happen to have tetanus wouldn't I have to pay a lab fee to check my blood or something? Or would it just be a simple fee for a shot?

Next month he's turning 80. Now, the hospital itself is not doing anything to celebrate his life or his work, but it fells really wrong to let all that pass unremembered. So me and some coworkers are planning to do a small homage for him.

Health,My belly button is... Open. It's a hole.,"Today I was experiencing discomfort in my naval area and realized it was bleeding and had a foul discharge. I shower regularly and have had funk issues before but this was different. I asked my partner to help me see where the blood was coming from after sterilizing it with peroxide, and he proceeded to explore. I'm a little overweight by about 20 pounds but I'm not gross, I can fit comfortably in a size small but he couldn't find the bottom of my bellybutton, as if it went on forever. It looks normal at a glance because it's perforated, but when he used two quips to push the skin back it was just blackness. I thought it was a joke, but he used a flashlight and a camera and there is indeed a hole. I'm doing research but not finding anything, although I've read a little on urachal fistulas. What is going on? I'm mortified.

**Edit: I'm growing more puzzled every second as I look through these endless posts of people who have been dismissed by doctors who have never seen this condition. Is this an emergency? So many people seem to go on, even with persistent bleeding and the doctor never finds the condition...**



**UPDATE: went to an urgent care facility and found out I had bronchitis an that I had a soft tissue infection deep in my umbilichus causing it to open and was told it would heal up on its own. I got prescribed antibiotics for the bronchitis and an ointment for my navel. I'm a little worried about this ""diagnosis,"" however, because he didn't look at my belly button, just felt for a hernia and sent me on my way.

Health,What's the best thing you can do to prevent scarring after a scab (accidentally) gets removed before healing is finished?,"A while ago I had a few identical wounds on my forearm, and they all scabbed-up as healing wounds normally do. However I accidentally scraped the scab of one of my wounds against something which caused it to mostly peel-off. So I ""grafted"" the scab back on, put Neosporin on it, and covered it with a bandaid for a few days.

Now, a few months later, all of my other wounds are completely healed-up (you couldn't even tell they were there), but the area where the scab got peeled-off now permanently has scar tissue on it.

Are there any other methods, or just general knowledge, I should know about to help prevent scars from forming in this circumstance? Clearly, the often-said ""use Neosporin and a bandaid"" combo didn't really work.

Also, I've heard that applying Vitamin E (eg, Vitamin E oil) to wounds, both when they're healing or after they've healed, can help prevent scarring or at least make them less noticeable. But I've only ever seen anecdotal layman testimonies saying they swear it works, and health experts saying that using Vitamin E for this purpose is inconclusive.

I love the university itself, but I don't think I was ready to leave my home city.  I'm considering transferring home to Boise State University (a pretty good computer science/engineering school)

Health,Does this mean I am infertile??... :-(,"Hi there everyone,

About 2 weeks ago I got kicked in the testicles and the right testicle bruised up and hurt. I iced it and napped and it was ok a day or two later. Then again 2 days ago I got kicked there again, but no bruising, just a 'continual' feeling of pain in the right testicle again.

I went to the ER today and they gave me the following report after the sonagram, and examination:

- ""The testicles are normal in echotexture and symmetric in size"".
- ""Blood flow to testicles is normal and there is no evidence of torsion or epididymitis""
- ""There is no focal testicular lesion"".
- ""Symmetric arterial and venous flow to testicles"".

However it also adds this:

For right testicle:
- ""Complex right hydrocele appears suggestive of blood products"".
- ""Nonspecific focal ovoid hypoechoic lesion in right epididymal head measuring 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.9 cm""
- ""Focal area of increased echogenicity in right epididymal head measuring 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.4 cm.""

For left testicle:
- ""Nonspecific echogenic lesion in left epididymal head"".

I am worried - I have tried googling a lot of those terms but I want to be sure - does this mean my testicles cannot produce sperm?? 

I am slated to call a urologist Monday but I am so scared at the moment from this infertility possibility.. (I am 29 y/o btw). The testicles seem normal but what about all that other stuff? :-(

Health,Should I be worried about my heart?,"Hi, I'm a 23 year old male who eats quite healthy but doesn't exercise often. I have a large belly (about 30 pounds overweight). Last year, I felt chest pain and a numbness in my left arm. I went to a doctor who did an electrocardiogram and said that it looked like I was having a heart attack. After going to the hospital, the cardiologist said she doubted that because of my age and weight. An angiogram showed that my heart was healthy. They suspected I had myopericarditis, due to a flu I had just recovered from.

They gave me some beta blockers, a bunch of NSAIDs for a few days, and sent me on my way. They followed up a week later to make sure I was normal. I had some arrythmia, felt my heart beat or skip a beat daily for a while, but then I forgot about it. 

Over the past month or so, I've noticed arrythmia a little more frequently. Every couple of days, maybe more (since it freaks me out when it happens) I feel my heart beat awkwardly for a split second. I had a panic attack while taking marijuana a few months ago, though I was having another heart attack. Today, I've felt my heart beat really hard two or three times. It scares me, my heart beats harder, I almost have a panic attack. I did have a night of heavy drinking, but this isn't the first time this happened.

I'm wondering, should I go to a doctor? Should I check my blood pressure? Is this most likely just panic? If your heart beats and you can hear it, or feel it in your neck, is that a problem? I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, but once something affects your heart, life gets a bit scarier.

pharmacy,Questions on pharmacy school,"I am a current freshman at an excellent school that has a pharmacy program (on the first page of the College of Pharmacy Rankings link on the right), and I have a guaranteed spot in pharmacy school provided my math/science grades average to a 3.5 or better.  The problem is a TON of people (hundreds) are pre-pharmacy majors and drop it due to the insane coursework (the class of pharmacy students admitted last year was well under 200, and was probably around 150ish).  Right now I am doing fine in my classes (have a 4.0 or something around it in chem, despite not paying much attention in the lectures) and have around a 2.7 to 3.0 in biology (not my strongest subject).  I am very good at math, and seem to be doing well in chem.  So my questions:

* How hard is it to keep up with the work in upper levels of undergrad (organic chem, physiology, cell bio etc), and how much harder is the work when in pharmacy school?

* Despite being guaranteed a spot in pharmacy school, if when I apply for pharmacy school my grades are below a 3.5 or if I withdrawal from a class (there's a list of qualifiers) I can't get a guaranteed spot, but I can still get in.  What would give me an edge over the other students applying?  I did an internship at a hospital my senior year of high school and had an amazing experience that confirmed to me that I wanted to go into pharmacy, but what else should I have?  Should I look into getting a job as a pham tech? (Also worth noting, a lot of the people that I know that want to go into pharmacy are obviously doing it for the money.  I am one of the people that doesn't mind how much it pays, though after 7 years of college this might change, I am really interested in this stuff.  I genuinely want to know how the stuff works, why it works and all that stuff.  How can I convey this to somebody that would potentially be interviewing me?)

* What advice (if any) do you have for me?",15,6,2011-11-17,PHARMA,0.08130407333374023,0.8894214034080505,0.029274532571434975

Health,Jock Itch - some advice/opinions on recovery signs and time,"I have had jock itch before and the symptoms are identical although less severe this time. It got quite painful as the skin was cracking pretty deep and the infection was oozing a clear liquid. The infection is only on the right side of my groin (no sign at all being on the left) and it is the surface area of roughly 3/5ths a palm of hand.

 I went to the doctor but being in China there was obviously a language barrier, nonetheless the doctor said it was a fungus and prescribed me with ""compound ketaconzel"" cream. 

I applied it and the infection has become pretty much painless and no longer pussing over the past week as well a slightly lighter pink colour (inside of vagina pink). There were also a few red dots in my pubic hair region that have disappeared. I have also been blow drying it a few times a day to dry it out, my blow dryer doesn't have a cool setting so I am hopefully not damaging it.

Nonetheless, I may be imagining this, but I think the infection is growing in surface area, but very slightly... This happens after I wear tight underwear or pants and it gets irritated, is this normal? It is painless but still pink. If it is growing in area but is not itchy or painful, what does this mean? 

When I blow dry it some parts (on the edge of my scrotum) gets flaky while the original infected area gets dry but not flaky. Do these flakes mean the fungus is dying, and should i brush them off? And blow drying with hot air, could this damage the skin and cause spread even further?

When I put on the cream it is absorbed pretty quickly and the infection seems pretty dry. This is good right?

The infection goes about a centimeter into my thick pubic hair and there is one red spot that feels like a pimple/ingrown hair. Should I be worried about this or is this normal for jock itch?

My scrotum has also become quite pink and clammy with definitive border strictly on the scrotum only. This happens after a shower and blow dry and I don't know how long it lasts but in the morning it is usually fine and at the moment it is completely normal. Why is this? and should I be concerned?

Are the disappearance of itch and pain signs that it is dying? Or does it mean it is maturing more?

Sorry for all the questions but being in a foreign country and not knowing the language nor access to an english doctor is fairly daunting especially with an infection around the groin area. I can't quite remember from my last infection how long the recovery time is but do you guys have any estimates? I've read 2 - 4 weeks but given the symptoms do you guys think longer?

Any advice or anything would be greatly appreciated.

Health,Tested negative for Celiacs but still bothered by grains?,"Hello all, been going through some health related issues as of late and I thought maybe you could be of more help than my Dr (who is a useless one at that). About two months ago I stopped eating grains for a new diet and I saw a tremendous change in my mood (depression and anxiety specifically.) I soon stumbled upon a bunch of Celiac websites and was convinced that I must have it. Fast forward to last week I find that I tested negative for it and have in the past two days  have convinced myself that it must have all been plaebo. By not eating grains its harder for me to get all my carbs in for the day which led to other problems so I switched back.

Is this all placebo from your perspective or could I still have a grain sensitivity even if its not Celiacs?

Health,Do any of you think this is alopecia?,"Before I get into this in depth heres some background information: I'm 15 years old and female. Despite always having a high forehead,thanks to my fathers genetics, recently my hair line has started to recede and become slightly patchy. The past two years has been very tough on myself and family (please don't make any naive assumptions that these ""difficult times"" were of a weak nature). I have no family history of alopecia. I don't manage stress very well. I suffer an auto-immune disease (non-serious).

Okay, here we go. Since last year I have noticed my hair line slowly becoming more thin and far back and I fell to be very self conscious about it. I ended up becoming petrified of windy weather as I was scared it would blow my bangs backward and that my friends or even random strangers would see how ridiculously far back it was. Jumping ahead to these last three to four months and I'd been under a painful amount of stress. I noticed my hair was clumping out in the shower and didn't think much of it as it's winter. Then today I was clearing up my skin and checking I wasn't getting any dry patches and I noticed that my hair line had started to become patchy and uneven. I don't have any pictures from before it became how it is now but I do have ones I took not long ago. My hair is rather strong but also rather damaged at the ends of most hairs and is generally rather thick and ""poofy"" besides the front where it's very thin. My scalp has psoriasis patches on it and hasn't ever really been in good condition because of the condition and it does cause irritation though this is at the back of the scalp not the front. Please excuse the censoring.

I'm hoping some of you guys have some hints and tips besides a hair transplant and learning to cope with stress.

Any ideas?","So basically my boyfriend is a podcast freak, and in an effort to listen to the ridiculous amount of files that he has downloaded he insists on listening to them in double-speed. I don't know what it is about the double speed but it causes me to get severe headaches and eventually nausea. He puts on headphones when he can, but for instance right now he's cooking so he can't. Also since he thinks that this is made up he's not too inclined to be accommodating. In related health history, i do suffer from vertigo and motion sickness, and what i experience when i listen to his podcasts is a milder form of what i feel during say a vertigo incident.

Any help or theories would be much appreciated!

Health,Doctors have been unable to diagnose my condition for years. Can you help?,"Hey everyone!


I’m a newcomer to Reddit, but I could really use some help – a friend told me that Redditors frequently assist in providing insight towards tough “mystery diagnosis” medical cases. I have been struggling with a myriad of issues for a long time now and I’m desperate for any assistance you might be able to provide. 


First off, thank you for taking the time to read this; I know it’s long and a bit hard to piece together because it’s a little all over the place. A little about myself: I’m female, 24 years old now and this has been going on for about 4 years. I’ve been to several doctors except towards the end and have only recently stopped pursuing a correct diagnosis due to lack of financial means. I was very healthy prior to getting ill and it really hit me out of nowhere. 


Current symptoms: chronic fatigue, chronic pain, lack of appetite (though that may be due to pain) lack of concentration, seizures (haven’t had one for over 6 months though), instances of mobility/balance issues, incontinence at times, spamming of the back (which I am assuming is due to back issues), often cold (and its not unusual for my core body temp to be 97.6 regularly – not sure if that is abnormal or not), tremors, forgetfulness and I’m off the cane now but still can’t go for long places without it. 


I’ve had no prior history to illness except being born prematurely and detached retina of both eyes which was reattached with surgery at birth to 1 year. I also want to note that I was in the line of work of fitness and I was very healthy at this time as part of my career both in nutrition and exercise. Four years ago I was admitted to the hospital with a possible TIA which was confirmed but not figured out to cause and delirium. Heart was erratic but had no problems in terms of EKG or any other tests. The slurring of words and periods of problems with mobility continued to be erratic and I was kept for tests and observation. Blood tests over time showed antibodies for CMV and mononucleosis (which I had as a child). Other blood work was normal. 


I continued to deteriorate and had trouble walking, chronic pain, migraines and it eventually went to partial paralysis where I was unable to sit up or walk on my own. They continued to do testing and still could not find anything wrong in my C-Scan and only saw minor spinal injuries at the time. Psychological was ruled out as well as a source and this continued for 2 weeks. They were going to send me to a teaching hospital but once I stated I had no insurance and no ability to pay, 2 days later they released me with the CMV as my walking had somewhat improved. 


I checked in with a doctor a week after for a follow up and explained I was still having pain and balance/mobility issues. He asked if I was better than I was in the hospital and I stated I wasn’t paralyzed but I was still having the same symptoms. He stated I was fine and said I should continue the antibiotic (for the CMV ) and rest. I did as he stated (who am I to argue?) and the pain did not diminish. Over the months as I still didn’t have insurance and didn’t qualify for free insurance, I was in and out of ER due to pain if absolutely necessary which he finally sent me to a rheumatologist for chronic myalgia. I went to him and he did a cursory exam and said if I had fibromyalgia, it was the worst case he had ever seen in his 20 years of practice. He stated he did not want to diagnose on the first visit and prescribed lyrica to see if it helped with pain. It did not but I kept trying. I was unable to see him again due to financial problems but he stated that until I got insurance, he really wasn’t able to do more tests for me due to cost and what not (I worked min wage part time at a job at this time). 


I basically went through a lot of pain meds, ER visits if I couldn’t take it, self physical therapy through my prior martial arts training, meditation etc to deal with the chronic pain that had over taken every fiber of my body (and hence why they felt fibromyalgia). 


Fast forwarding a little, I finally got insurance and because during all this I had been having eye trouble (which unknown to me at the time was due to premature cataracts and the vitreous pulling from my retina since I had eye problems at birth) they told me to see a neurologist just in case. So I went in for that, told her of my previous history along with my medical records, she got immediately concerned and did MRI’s. Her concern was possibly having complex partial seizures, (due to instances of slurred speech, trouble remembering etc) and a few other things she wanted to rule out. Blood work at this time showed heavy Vitamin D deficiency and mild celiac disease but nothing else. MRI’s showed herniated discs and a host of problems of my lower back which I was sent to a spinal specialist for. Over the months of testing, I developed symptoms of having trouble walking due to balance and some pain. I ended up at on a cane and I was walking 3 miles to the bus and 3 miles back at this point every day so I wasn’t sedentary. Plus it helped me to stay active and stretch in terms of my back from a fitness level. In any case, the neuro told me I need to see a rheumatologist and an MS specialist as even though plaques hadn’t showed up in my MRI and spinal tap, it could possibly be early signs of MS. Spinal doctor also began pain mgmt with non narcotics and after everything was tried, he upgraded to narcotic, which I eventually went to long acting opana from the short acting nucynta (which works well ot not cause a “high” effect). 


MRI’s from the spinal doctor showed herniated discs (though not horrific), spinal stenosis, spondylosis, facet hypertrophy (which I am understood is similar to arthritis of the spine) and some other problems. He wanted me to go back to a neuro which I did who did a EEG and ruled it non-epileptic seizures but couldn’t find a cause. Again I went to a psychiatrist and psychologist to rule out mental and they both concluded that it was NOT mentally related. After doing this, the neurologist ran a EMG (which HURTS) and stated I did not have muscular dystrophy. I saw an MS specialist as well who stated that it COULD be MS but without plaques, he couldn’t diagnose. He encouraged me to see a rheumatologist again to make sure that lupus was ruled out with additional testing. Unfortunately I went to another rheumatologist who saw my blood work (which was normal) and therefore wouldn’t do more testing. When I started having more of clonic tonic type seizures, I also ended up in a wheelchair for four months. Eventually I was able to work back up to the cane. No idea what caused it though spinal doc is thinking maybe a variety of things or if its auto immune, maybe its flaring up? 


My spinal doctor felt that this wasn’t wise so he wanted me to go to the Mayo clinic to see a neurologist and possibly a rheumatologist. Unfortunately at this time I had financial difficulties due to not being able to work (and can’t get disability due to not knowing what is wrong) and had to stop seeking a diagnosis and treatment. Due to financial reasons I’m also off all medication except for allegra 24 hours due to allergies and occasionally 10 mg of baclofen one time a day if my back gets too out of hand. 


 I’m getting insurance again soon (have a work from home job now) and just am looking for anyone that has heard of anything like this. I know it’s hard to believe and if I hadn’t been living it for 3 years, I wouldn’t either…but I need any help someone can offer me so I can tell them my thoughts and theories and they can test for them.

Health,Huge hangover after consuming only 2 or 3 drinks?,"I have started have massive 12 hour hangovers after i drink maybe 2 or 3 drinks the night before. This has all started only recently, as i used to be able to drink all night without getting any hangover. 

I drink plenty of water after drinking, and that hasn't made the hangovers go away. I usually drink liquor (don't drink beer or wine), cocktails usually with well alcohol. Rum &amp; Coke, Vodka &amp; Sprite are the most common drinks i order, usually these are well drinks.

If i go out and over the course of 3-5 hours consume even 2 or 3 drinks, the next day i experience symptoms of a severe hangover that can easily last 8-12 hours before they go away. Symptoms include: super nausea, dizzy, can't get out of bed, wet shits, ect...

I really enjoy going out with my friends on the weekend and having a few drinks, I don't drink more than once or twice a week, but i do want to continue to do that with my friends and so the solution of ""just don't drink"" isn't really what i'm looking for here. 

Is there anyway i can narrow this down to what is causing this? any ideas for a solution? Help would be greatly appreciated reddit, i'm not an alcoholic, but i do enjoy the occasional drink and don't want to give it up.

**EDIT 2:** Here are mum's responses:
First off, she is extremely grateful, and thinks this is a wonderful resource. She also wants you to know she has been looking after this man for ten years. In view of that, she knows it is not: Hepatic Encephalopathy, Multiple Sclerosis, Myasthenia Gravis. She also has real trouble believing it's partial seizures.

* She will be sending off for all the autobodiess and ANCA antibodies.
* She will be checking for zinc, magniesum, iatrogenic cushings, and anything atherosclerotic is being considered and investigated, but it takes time.
* In terms of infective endocarditis, it was considered and rejected because: no fever, CRP normal, and full blood exam normal.
* Did anyone consider cervical spine abnormalities or brachial plexus damage in a fat, asthmatic, diabetic man?

medicine,"Spent 20 years in school, $150,000, finally graduated med school, now I'm 5 months into internship, and I hate hate hate medicine. Now what?","I got into medicine because I wanted a career where I could feel like I was helping people while using science.

I decided this in high school, then I did biology as an undergrad, then went straight to med school. I did pretty well in the ""preclinical"" years (lots of ""honors"" grades, 250s on step 1, etc) but during the clinical years, I struggled a bit. Turns out, my ability to understand intricate things isn't quite as important as having an ability to decipher what patients are saying, figure out their (usually mundane) problem, and then decide on a course of action.

Being truly shy, and also very introverted don't help either, when making hospital rounds, seeing patients in clinic, and talking with nurses, therapists and consultants is basically my whole job.

Anyway, I'd always thought that I wanted to be a surgeon, but gave that up in my 4th year because of the hours, the additional stress, and to be honest, some degree of not enough self-confidence. I ended up getting into a family medicine residency, which I started last July.

I guess it's OK. I do really believe that primary care is a valuable thing, I mean, I believe in the specialty. I CAN perform my duties. I'm convinced that my problem has a lot less to do with my specialty in medicine than being involved in medicine as a whole.

But now that I'm actually ""doing"" some real medicine, I hate it. I don't like being in the hospital, I especially don't like being ""on call"" just waiting around to have to go admit another alcoholic in DKA, and I don't like clinic (too quick, too much paperwork, too many drug seekers).

I keep telling myself that, once I just get used to it, get through the first few months, get past intern year, that it will be better, and I'll start liking my job, getting better at it, and I'll love medicine.

But I'm not so sure. I have a hard time thinking that I'll instantly change my personality to be compatible with doing medicine well. Its hard to believe that the nature of the work changes substantially after intern year. I worry that I've wasted so much time and energy and years of my life learning something, only to realize that I despise it, and given the chance would run far, far away from.

I don't know what to do. Part of me knows that I can stick it out, get used to this, just put my head down and do it for the next 30 years. There's another part of me that tells me I need to listen to my gut and find a different career. Obviously I'm torn. Like a lot of people, I want a career that matches up with my interests, and let's me feel like I'm doing something important for the world. I've thought a lot about the possibility of getting into more of a bench research type of career (though more schooling would probably be needed for that). 

I don't know what to do. Do any of you have any thoughts or suggestions?",60,46,2011-11-30,PHARMA,0.04027730971574783,0.9249061942100525,0.034816425293684006

Health,My two year old daughter has elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase in her blood work. I'm scared :(,"I'm not sure if anyone out there has experience with this or can answer any of my questions, but I figured I'd give it a shot. 

For months she's been having issues with her digestive system. At first we thought it was a food intolerance, but when it came frequently every 5-6 weeks and lasted 12-18 hours, we decided to seek more in depth medical attention. The first doctor we took her to said ""kids get the flu"" and passed us off, but once we found a new doctor they did urine tests and blood tests for multiple things. The only symptoms she's had are the vomiting issues which present themselves in the form of reoccurring once every 5-6 weeks, inability to get out of bed, cries in agony, and she has projectile vomiting that occurs about 10 times an hour. These episodes last between 12-18 hours and then she goes back to normal like nothing happened. During them though, she can't move, eat, or drink. 

Anyway, we got her urine test back on Monday. They said she had a UTI. So we got antibiotics. Yesterday we got her blood work results back. They said that a normal toddler has levels of alkaline phosphatase up to 300, but hers is at the 4000 range. The doctor couldn't tell us much of anything other than the fact that hepatitis or liver issues could be a big factor, though she's not had any other symptoms. I'm terrified to say the least and our next step is waiting to hear back on hepatitis and get an ultrasound done on her liver on next Tuesday. Of course, that's a long wait, and considering I'm pregnant right now and extremely stressed out/googling very bad results, I feel insanely nuts. 

So I was wondering if anyone had experience in this. Does is usually mean liver problems? Would there have to be other signs and symptoms? Could the UTI have set something off to make the levels high? I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone has answers before I go in and do more waiting... My doctor just doesn't really respond to any questions, which I guess is understandable, but :(
