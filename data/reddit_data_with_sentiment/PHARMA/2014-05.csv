Though whenever I go to a specialist whether Neurologist, Gastroenterologist, Otolaryngologist they ask for $150 and get about $95 from United healthcare,  My copay in these cases is still $10.  The only doctor who actually gets paid more is the Ophthalmologist who claims around $900 and comes out getting around $400.

pharmacy,Confusion on fill date for CII pain medications,"Hi all, I'm a chronic pain patient that is constantly confused about when my CII meds can be filled.

I have a degenerative condition and have been prescribed opiates for about 7 years.  I'm really confused as to how many days it must be before a new month's supply can be filled.  Usually after I visit my doctor I will drop my prescriptions off with the pharmacy, and ask them to let me know when I can pick them up.

I'm using insurance, and know that they give the pharmacists the ok on if it's too soon or not.  I've seen inconsistent dates over the years, and for the life of me can't figure out why.  In some cases, they will not fill until it's been 27 days.  Sometimes 29 days.  I've even had cases where they filled at 25 days with no issues, which surprised me.  In each of these cases the medication strength and dosage is exactly the same as it was the previous month.  So what's the deal?  Is there a standard?

If it's relevant, I'm located in Texas.  Thanks!",19.0,8,2014-05-07,PHARMA,0.04711934179067612,0.9221205115318298,0.030760060995817184

I have answered a bunch of basic to challenging personality questions that really make you think in my notes, and have studied them all night and today.

I focused on time management, going above and beyond to be precise and make sure everything is at 100% quality. Detail oriented. When I set out to complete something I always make sure the work gets completed.

I feel my past jobs give me relevant skills (other than working with drugs), such as stocking, keeping track of orders, what's in stock, where my stock actually is, checking dates of what is out of code, keeping a clean and organized workspace, having to fit in and cooperate among a team, organizing my time correctly to finish the job at my best possible accuracy, etc.

pharmacy,"Adderall XR: How does the state of consumption (i.e. fed or fasted) affect the first elimination half-life and/or specific plasma concentrations at (*t*^hours = (1, 2, 3, ...10)?","Hi all,

I'm currently prescribed 30mg Adderall XR/day for my ADHD. I'm curious as to how consumption in a fasted state vs. a fed state would affect the length of the first elimination half-life. 

My understanding is that consumption of the d-amphetamine in a fasted state allows for an absorption rate where peak plasma concentration is reached at 5.2 hours, whereas consumption in a fed state significantly slows the rate of absorption, delaying time to peak plasma to 7.7 hours after administration.

The mean elimination half-life for d-amphetamine is reportedly ~10 hours, but I'm curious as to if/how the state (fasted or fed) of the subject (me :D) at the time of administration could affect the elimination half-life of the drug. And, if the elimination half life would not be affected, how would the graph of T*max*/*t* for Adderall XR administered in the fasted state compare to [this graph](http://imgur.com/bjV8d5D) ([source](http://pi.shirecontent.com/PI/PDFs/AdderallXR_USA_ENG.PDF)) of the drug taken in a fed state?",5.0,7,2014-05-14,PHARMA,0.09228673577308655,0.880836546421051,0.026876764371991158

medicine,What is the lowest hemoglobin level that you have seen in a patient that was still alive?,"Just out of curiosity and for fun.

The lowest I have ever seen was 2.1 gm/dL in a lady of about 55 years of age with aplastic anemia who had missed a few of her regular transfusion appointments. She was shockingly healthy given her low Hb levels. She was admitted with a chief complaint of cough with sputum and much to my shock she did not complain of any severe fatigue etc. Only had loud heart sounds and a ejection systolic murmur from hyperdynamic circulation. No other cvs findings.

According to one of my professors, the lowest he had ever seen was around 1.7 or 1.8 gm/dL in a lady with IDA and menorrhaiga.

medicine,What are your craziest investigation results (in a living patient)?,"Inspired by the [haemoglobin thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/26121x/what_is_the_lowest_hemoglobin_level_that_you_have/), let's all show how cool we are with crazy blood/other test results. I'll start you off, most of these come from ICU/renal jobs.

K+: Crazy guy who went off to Africa after his transplant and didn't bother to have any checks (looked like Gandalf/a garden gnome) was chilling out in the waiting room with a potassium of 9.5. Lived.

Creatinine: Big black guy with HIVAN presented with a creatinine of 3400µmol/L (about 38mg/dl). Lived.

Na: Psychogenic polydipsia, found unconscious on psych ward 95mEq/L. Developed central pontine myelinolysis. Died. 99 is the lowest I've seen who lived.

CK: Over 1.5 million. A very unfortunate guy basically infarcted his body. The lab decided to continue to dilute as an experiment but stopped once they got above 1 and a half million. He obviously died.

pH *in someone who lived*: 6.4 in a 15 year old girl. Young people have astonishing physiology. We've all seen worse in arrests but this girl made a full recovery.

My best Hb was 2.8 (not as good as some in the other thread) in a 24 year old Sri Lankan girl with von Willebrand disease type III. Lived. Had a huge troponin rise as well.

CRP: &gt;499 (top of assay range). This 30 something guy apparently just had a virus. Lived.

Left ventricle: 12cm. You see some insane things on transplant. Volume was something like 400+ml.

Temperature *in someone who lived*: 30C? Not that impressive (for those that don't know the story of [Anna Bågenholm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_B%C3%A5genholm), check it out. Now a radiologist, she survived several **hours** without a cardiac output at 13.7C and made a full recovery. I know we're taught no one is dead until they're warm and dead, but so many places would've just pronounced her dead. It's a real testament to the treating doctors that they persisted.

medicine,"What exactly is ketosis, how does it differ from lipolysis?","I'm looking for a technically correct but lay-person understandable explanation of ketosis and lipolysis.

After having read many online explanations and dictionary definitions of ketosis, I'm seeing it used to describe three different things.

* Some sources define ketosis as the **process** by which fatty acids are turned into ketone bodies.
* Some sources define ketosis as an **abnormal buildup** of ketone bodies in the body.
* Some sources say that ketosis is **synonymous** with ketoacidosis.

Despite what those third sources say, I believe that ketosis and ketoacidosis are different things. But I'm very confused as to whether strictly speaking ketosis is the process of creating ketone bodies or the buildup of ketone bodies.

I'm also finding it confusing to distinguish lipolysis from ketosis. Some sources say they go hand-in-hand, others suggest they are completely unconnected.

Assuming that one is attempting to reduce body fat via a long-term sustainable diet, it seems that by definition lipolysis has to occur.  How would it be possible to sustain lipolysis without causing ketosis to also occur?

P.S. I know there is a r/keto forum, but reading there has helped cause some of this confusion, and I'd prefer a medically correct explanation of the precise definition of ketosis and how it differs from lipolysis. i.e. I'm looking for technical understanding, not diet advice.",11.0,6,2014-05-23,PHARMA,0.05108103156089783,0.9275723099708557,0.021346621215343475

I'm well versed in the KRAS/BRAF reflex testing and it's implications. I started reading about BRAF inhibitors for melanoma and it went down a CRC wormhole. A quick survey says to me that BRAF inhibitors in CRC cause a reflexive upregulation of EGFR which negates any anti-tumor effect. I saw people supposing that pairing EGFR and BRAF drugs could have a CRC response, but I didn't see any clinical data about that drug pairing.

medicine,"I'm translating medical acronyms so students can better understand information on the wards, and I need your help!","I run mediwikis, a UK-based wiki for med students to share notes and information.

I'm not the sharpest med student around, but I know I'm not alone in experiencing that initial intimidation on the wards when acronyms and eponymous names are flying around, and I can see how much these get in the way of learning.

To get over this, I've started a project on mediwikis to translate these non-words, and link to relevant content on and off-site. Students can then search for the acronym on the website, or via our free apps:

* Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mbbswiki.webapp110113
* iPhone: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mediwikis/id763799721

I know there's some great services already out there in the form of med lexicon, or even google, but I think this will be a bit different; for starters, it's medical-specific, so searching an acronym won't bring up stock listings. It's also geared towards students, for the right amount of information at the right time.

There's rather a lot of acronyms out there, and we could really do with Meddits help to catalogue these :)

We know for Nexium to be most effective, it has to be taken an hour before eating.

But what if the user had already eaten 1-2 hours beforehand? How long must they wait before they can take their Nexium for max effectiveness? Assuming they're on a 2 dose a day schedule.

**For Example:**

**1.** User eats at 5 PM.

**2.** Takes their Nexium at 7 PM.

**3.** User then eats again at 8 PM.



Is this the proper procedure? Can a user wait an hour or two after eating and still have the Nexium be effective as long as they wait another hour before eating again?",16.0,5,2014-05-30,PHARMA,0.03440284729003906,0.9260200262069702,0.03957710415124893
