Health,"Swollen Ear, canal is fully blocked now. Seen a doctor yesterday, was told to put olive oil to soften the wax so he could remove in a week","So i dropped few drops of olive oil and this morning it was much worse.. It's alot more sensitive, the canal is fully blocked (i can't hear anything from that ear), but any mouth movement or pulling on ear lobes 'pops' the ear canal open (literally with a pop sound).. I haven't looked at it yesterday but today (using 2 mirrors) i looked at the ear, and the inner part of ear that you can from outside is quite swollen and that area is really red..

Doctor yesterday said he wasn't sure if it was an infection but ear wax was blocking it.. If it was only wax blocking, would it be swollen also?

What should I do? I don't want to waste doctor's time, but should I go back to him, should I ask to see a specialist (that's what my dad suggested since a slightest mistake could seriously damage my ear)?",15,4,2011-03-02,PHARMA,0.36844947934150696,0.598334789276123,0.033215753734111786
Health,Reddit i need advice for my stomach ailments. I am getting desperate.,"Hi Reddit, I was wondering if you could help me. I have been suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) for the past two years, or at least that is what the doctors told me I have. When my symptoms were really bad I had such awful pain and cramping that I literally couldn't go to class, affecting my grades as a college student. After going to a number of gastroenterologists, they all concluded I had IBS. They ran a number of tests including stool samples and blood tests, and concluded it must be IBS because I am not allergic to any specific food as far as they could tell. They also tested me for things like crohn's disease, celiac, etc with no luck. After being given a few options by doctors, I have literally tried everything, from changing my diet to trying various probiotics, even taking SSRI's to try to lessen the severity of my IBS related symptoms.  
Nothing was working until i started smoking pot more. i instantly realized that on the days I smoked the bowel movements were still bad, but the pain and cramping was almost nonexistent. Over the past 6 months or so I've been smoking weed almost daily. I have a newfound appreciation for weed on top of what I already had. Whenever I take a sobriety break however, within a day or two the symptoms come back with a vengeance. When I told my current GI this, he told me that he could not give me THC pills as a legal substitute, as I live in Illinois where medical marijuana is not legal.
Over the past 10 days or so i have not smoked marijuana, I have been incredibly swamped with school and have been really broke. Between all the medications I've tried and being a broke college student I can't afford marijuana right now. I've also realized I don't want to be completely dependent on a drug that is still illegal and costs a fair amount of money, especially when you smoke every day. While I love pot, i don't want to be dependent on it the rest of my life.
Over the past week or so because of my sobriety my symptoms have come back with a fury. Not only is it hurting my grades, but it is hurting my social life, and leaving me in emotion distress. I don't really know what to do, I've been in incredible pain and discomfort.
Reddit please help, if you can offer any advice on what I can try please do, or if you suspect it is anything other than IBS let me know as well. I am getting desperate, I don't trust a lot of the IBS forums and help sites I look at, and I know Reddit is a great resource, i just hope this is the proper place for this.",17,4,2011-03-02,PHARMA,0.11185804009437561,0.8597954511642456,0.02834656834602356

medicine,Adderall... or Diet Coke...               #WINNING,"I read a few posts on adderall and I thought I could offer some insight. I posted 2 at the end.  I've been taking Adderall for about 8 years now and before that I had taken Ritalin, Dexadrine, Concerta, Stratera, Welbutrin, Adderall, etc...  While I have been recently giving myself 40mg a day, I’ve been there and back.  I’m have been at the point where if I don’t take it I will sleep indefinitely for years and CONSTANTLY struggling to find that equilibrium… you will never find equilibrium with adderall. It is ups and downs, feeling good, feeling good and being afraid you’re about to feel bad, feeling bad, sleeping…  

Some Points:

- The best way to think about adderall addiction is like a coke addiction, with the differences being around how it's taken as far as situations, reasons for starting it, reasons for abusing it, and length of effect. other than that it's the same feeling, effects and side effects and I'd imagine treatment would be similar

- The key to taking adderall for an extended period of time is CONSTANT monitoring of your tolerance... It takes a lot of self analysis to know what dosages make you feel what and how many days in a row you've felt that... whether you are starting to feel less, do you need to feel that way today, maybe cut back for the day.  Try to take 1x to 2x days a week off completely.... try to keep the dosage as low as possible, taking hiatuses as necessary and when possible.

- start to analyze how different pills and ways of taking the medicine makes you feel.

  * i know if I'm going to work a long day (which is every day) the best dosage for me is an adderall instant in the morning and then when it starts to wear off an XR.  I also take equal amounts even though the xr dosage is comparable to half an instant dosage… this works in two manners: 1) if you take the xr first you may be disinclined to take the instant in the evening as it will you hard and inhibit your sleeping 2) the XR will wear off in a friendlier manner, causing less of a comedown.

  * I know if I take a dosage and go back to sleep in the morning I'll wake up feeling awake. if I wait until i'm awake and take it without going back to sleep I'll probably be groggy... In this manner I know I can achieve the same feeling by taking a low dose and waking up to it as I would if I woke up and then took a large dose once already up

  * once you start to overload your dosage and take large amounts you start to increase your tolerance dramatically.  If you do that you should take a hiatus after otherwise you’ll have to step up your dosage mildly to achieve the same feeling, and once you get used to the new dosage it will harder to get back down.  I feel that people that end up abusing it don’t realize that you CANT always get that high feeling, in 5-6 days that large dosage that gives you that feelin will stop working and you will have to up the dosage indefinitely…
Examples:

1)	you take 20mg a day every day for a month, the weekend comes and you want to feel good, go out, talk to people, etc so you take 40mg.  The next day 20 won’t do much, and the day after that even less… Therefore you will need to up your 20mg dosage to 25+ to feel what you felt previously on 20mg

2)	You take 20mg every day for a month, now it doesn’t work as well… take a break and come back, if you want to wake up on the weekend take zero on Saturday and mg on Sunday, it may feel like crap but if you don’t you have to indefinitely up your dosage

- I've taken adderall for so long now that even if I went 2 months of not taking it I would STILL sleep all day.  Maybe I’d wake up with a lot of energy for an hour, only to pass out for 5 hours if I lied in bed.  With my new job I've been taking about 40mg a day.  This is about half my prescribed dosage and under what I was taking in prior jobs...

- if I don’t take adderall I feel tired but okay, if I take 5 mg, I feel like CRAP.  If I drink a coffee I feel like crap. The same with cigarettes, there is a threshold of uppers that if I don’t reach I feel like I’m coming down immediately

I've been through a lot in that time and as a success story of ADHD medicine I can offer some advice.  I've recently seen a friend start to abuse adderall, going from 10mg a day to 80mg a day in a short period and currently she's away in a rehab place (IDIOT).  I'm no longer friends with her because what was once doing her favors became her stealing from me and getting me into fights with my gf (now ex) because my gf didn't believe she stole from me

I also agree with WolfManZack that the 30-40 prescriptions you wrote for yourself is BS.  Not only would it not make sense because insurance wouldn’t cover it therefore would be few hundred dollars a script but you must have been going to a braindead pharmacist in an unregulated state.  While addy scripts are thet same as other scripts now, they used to be different. Normal scripts would have 2 copies via a duplicate carbon copy, while adderall had a triplicate.  In addition to the patient and the pharmacist copies the 3rd copy would go to a regulatory agency.  This was to stop someone from going from one doctor to another getting multiple prescriptions, let alone the same doctor prescribing unlawful amounts.  You’re very lucky you didn’t get busted as you could see prison time

Health,I'm pretty sure that I have a fairly rare eating disorder... and I have no idea what to do about it.,"Throwaway account.

I'm 90% sure that I have [orthorexia nervosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthorexia), and I have no idea what to do to fix it.

I used to have problems with both anorexia and bulimia, and I thought that I had eating disorders behind me...

I read ingredient labels righteously, looking up terms that I am unfamiliar with to evaluate their safety. I try to eat organic all the time, I don't touch any partially hydrogenated oils, I count saturated fat righteously, I do not eat anything with preservatives that I don't recognize, and I only eat a very limited list of items that I consider ""safe."" It isn't about calories, it's me afraid of getting cancer, or dying of heart disease, and so forth.

I've found that this is preventing me from going out and living a normal life. If I'm going out to eat with friends, I end up asking the waiter a zillion questions about the food, and even then usually end up ordered only something that I deem as ""safe"" (ex: white rice, plain bread, side salad with no dressing, etc.) I'm currently mildly underweight (5'4"" and 107 pounds), and my live-in boyfriend is really concerned about me.

I have no idea what to do about this. There is an eating disorder clinic in my area, but it appears that it only treats anorexia, bulimia, and compulsive eating. I just want to be a normal person, be able to eat something without asking 20 questions about it, and be able to enjoy food again.

I realized that I had this problem about an hour ago, when I induced vomiting so that I could get rid of bread in my stomach that had the artificial coloring azodicarbonamide in it (I was stupid and only thought to read the label after I ate a small chunk of the bread).

medicine,Describe your worst patient.,"The other day I had a woman with chest pain, hypertension, and A-fib who was the craziest nervous wreck I'd ever seen. When I went through her medications with her, she tells me she ran out of Zoloft about a week ago, and hasn't felt like picking it up. She was also on ""Something for blood pressure, but I went to the health food store and they told me the natural pills there were just as good"". Yep, homeopathic and 99.9% cornstarch.

She then starts running down a list of excuses why her heart rate would be irregular and why I shouldn't have her admitted to the cardio floor. My favorite was when she swore to god that it must have been the one Excedrin Migraine Formula she took 3 hours ago that did it. ""It had 65mg of caffeine and caffeine is really bad for your heart right?""

""Do you drink coffee ma'am?"" 

""Yes"" 

""Any problems then?"" 

""No""

""That's about the same as a weak cup of coffee. I would worry less about the Excedrin and more about those heart medications you haven't been taking. You also really need to pick up that Zoloft refill when you get out of here, because suddenly stopping it can make you feel real icky.""",26,33,2011-03-06,PHARMA,0.10452665388584137,0.86442631483078,0.03104706108570099

medicine,For those of you wondering what it's like to live with gout (partly NSFL).,"I started getting attacks when was I 16, I am 37 now.  In the last 6 years, it has gotten to the point where major surgery was necessary.  It started with my right ankle, then my left foot, mostly around the big toe.

Back in early 2010, I had the biggest piece taken care of, I decided to throw out some pics to help you better understand it.

[Here is my right foot the morning of surgery](http://i.imgur.com/I9xeH.jpg)

[Here is my right foot following surgery](http://i.imgur.com/VFBt0.jpg)

[Here is me enjoying the benefits of morphine as I came to and the pain started kicking in.](http://i.imgur.com/CO7hL.jpg)  Imagine being in the worst pain possible and having someone tooling around in the same painful joint.  It was just like when I would get cortisone shots in my joints prior to having surgery.

[Here is my foot all wrapped up a couple days after surgery](http://i.imgur.com/7IusR.jpg)

[Here is my initial doctor visit sans bandages.](http://i.imgur.com/xqHyk.jpg) [NSFL] The huge blister between the toes was caused by the bandage constantly rubbing.

[Here is what was removed from the joint](http://i.imgur.com/GA3W6.jpg) (yes, those are Sham-Wows in the background)

[Here is a closer look at what was taken out](http://i.imgur.com/ZoAF2.jpg), this cauliflower-like material is what builds up between the joints and causes most of the pain.

Unfortunately, all of the things I enjoy in my diet (wine/alcohol, fatty foods and shellfish) are some of the biggest reasons behind excessive buildup of gout deposits.  I am on track to eventually develop arthistis due to the deterioration of my joints.  I am already have problems in both elbows as well as my knees, in addition to my fingers.  Sometimes, it makes me never want to have kids for fear of passing this on to them.

medicine,Depression and ED,"Note: This will be one long rant about my libido, and in turn, my penis. If you don't care to discuss this stuff, why in the hell are you on /r/medicine, let alone clicking a link that has ED in the title?

Depression is known to cause ED (which in of itself is rather depressing), as are several SSRI's. Keeping this in mind, I made sure I settled for nothing other than Wellbutrin to treat my major depression and anxiety. It did the trick and after 2 weeks of treatment, I was easily aroused and had nocturnal penile tumescence daily. 

However, my sleep patterns have failed to return to normal, and after a month on Wellbutrin, my psychiatrist prescribed Ativan as I don't always have time to sleep a full 8 hours with Ambien. Suddenly, the erections disappeared, and I discontinued the Ativan. Three days later, still nothing beyond partial erection unless I wake with a full bladder. 

There's also been zero ETOH use since a week into the Wellbutrin. I had a couple beers after the first few days and became dizzy far too quickly for my liking.

How long does the libido change associated with benzos last in your experience? I've met a new potential mate, and being that this issue has ruined a night with sexual partners in the past, I'd like to know when it's safest to make a move and not have the night be a, well, flop...",5,3,2011-03-12,PHARMA,0.10511050373315811,0.860226571559906,0.03466294705867767

My current treatment works well for the emotional side of both issues, and a good deal of the physical reactions as well; however, the blushing remains.

Health,"So how about that Melatonin, folks? (I certainly approve)","I heard here on Reddit that Melatonin could be triggered by certain glasses, low-lighted home areas, and synthetic doses and it helps sleep *and increases the remembrance and intensity of dreams*.

So I got some last night, 3mg dose, and I did indeed have the first dream that I've remembered in some time, even after I woke up and usually forget right away.

So I had a string of dreams from the ~11PM-7AM sleep period, most notably getting to see Tool perform LIVE in my home while I was doing dishes which was a blast, and I wanted to shake Maynard's hand and giggle nervously at him for a bit so I went to wash/dry my hands properly in the bathroom but they were gone when I got back =/.

Here's the kicker: I snoozed from 0700-0710, and had a fully fledged cradle-to-grave dream in that time. 

I was working at a gun shop and some pleasant group of cowboy-type figures were browsing our selection and bullshitting with us over nothing and I go rearrange something in the back closet... I come back and see the main dude has bought a gold-plated add-on ridden AK-47 and I quickly think ""Hey, that type of display is for people consumed by ego-- evil folks..."" and sure enough when he walks out to his truck he turns around, loads the AK-47, and starts shooting and we hit the deck. We tactically exit the back using hand motions but they chase us down as we're running away with some sort of mounted chaingun from a nearby building. Eventually after ducking and weaving for some time, I finally feel some painless bullets ""thud-thud-thud-thud"" through my chest/spine and I wake up... 0709, my alarm's just about to go off.

Anywho, if there's anything we've learned here at /r/health, it's that correlation = causation and we can now say 100% that melatonin, **along with the expectation of remembering dreams**, will always trigger some vivid, awesome dreams.

I want nothing more than to help her but we aren't financially stable enough to pay outright for it and she doesn't have insurance. I'm especially worried about it because I know she won't take the initiative to take care of it. So I turn to you, reddit. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

A few days ago I was running a 10K and I know that my toe (that one) hurt a lot, but I kept on until I finished.  I then examined my toe and there appeared to be no damage, no blood.  So I went on.  

Fast forward 4 days, and a couple hours ago I was clipping my toe nails and it was all - clip clip clip HOLY SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?!  

I still have feeling in my toe, I can move it, it doesn't hurt, it isn't colder than my other toes.  This is on my actual toe, not the toe nail.  Really, if I hadn't started clipping my toe nails, I wouldn't have even noticed this i'm sure.  The ER is very expensive.  I'm going to wait until the morning and see what happens.  

I've read it can be an infection, blood clot (WTF scary!), and my friend mentioned it might be a bruise, but the symptoms don't match.

If you know what this is, or may be, please let me know.  I am still thinking (hoping) it's a minor bruise.  I'll monitor this and if it doesn't rapidly spread that's good.",22,11,2011-03-21,PHARMA,0.12356353551149368,0.8306183815002441,0.04581800475716591

Allright, so first off i started having problems with my bowel movements starting around june of 2010.  I went camping in the states in washington at a music festival for about 4 days at the end of May. Shortly before my irregular bowel movements in june i woke up one day with some slight pain in my stomach.  After about an hour the pain in my stomach slowly got worse to the point where i started growing faint and thought i was going to pass out or throw up from the pain, then shortly after that the pain subsided.  Shortly after this bizzarre episode  i would have soft and loose stool mostly since june until now.  

My frequency of bowel movements has been anywhere from 0 to 5 or 6 times a day, on average about 2 or 3 per day. The days where i dont have any bowel movements are fairly rare, maybe 1-3 times per month.  Also some weeks/days are worse than others.  Furthermore, my stool seems to always be changing from loose to soft to somehwat formed, as well as the size/shape of the bowel movement itself.  Anyways after about 2 or 3 months of this my doctor finally ordered blood and stool tests done.  Stool tests found nothing but my doctor concluded that i have celiac disease from my blood tests.  Also i had a lactose breathe test done and it found that im very lactose intolerant as well.  I have never had any problems with milk products prior to June.  I have always known that i am allergic to some nuts, extremeley allergic to cashews, and i also recently found that im allergic to soy products as well. 

After a few months of being on a gluten free and lactose free diet, my symptoms did not change in the slightest.

My current diet is as follows:
Meal 1: gluten free waffles / fruit / veggies
Meal 2: rice / fruit / veggies
Meal 3: eggs/ fruit
Meal 4: Chicken breast / rice / fruit
Meal 5: Steak / rice / veggies

Snacks: Rice Works rice chips/ occasionally starburst / skittles / other candy and coke

I also have been working out 4-5 times a week and drink one bottle of gatorade per workout.
This has been my diet for the last 5 months or so.  I have tried taking out things one at a time to see if any of these foods bothered me and saw no change in my bowel movements. 

At this point i would like to introduce my irregular heartbeat.  Since after highschool i have noticed an irregular heart beat occasionally.  It feels like my heart skips a beat, then beats really hard once and continues normally.  In the last year or so I have noticed that it does this twice in a row.(skip a beat, beats hard, skips another beat, beats hard).  It sometimes literally feels like my heart explodes.  I have had an ekg and a halter monitor come back with everything normal.  Of course when i wore the halter monitor for the day my irregular heartbeat did not occur.  

Also about 3 years ago I woke up one night ( didn't drink or do drugs the night before) around 6am feeling very light headed and faint, could barely see anything but managed to get up and get to the bathroom before passing out and indenting my bathroom tub with my head. (would have loved to see that on video).

Last week when i laid down in bed to go to sleep i had an episode of my irregular heartbeat followed by a serries of irregular heartbeats for about 5-10 seconds which i have never experienced before ( heart palpatations maybe?) accomponied by the feeling of being light headed / slightly faint.  After this happend i immiediately got up and sat down on my chair and felt fine right after.  

I finally have seen a specialist last month and had an upper endoscopy done.  The doctor said my small intestine looks fine and now im waiting to hear back on the results from the biopsy.  He has already scheduled me in for a colonoscopy next month as well.  

During this entire period i have been oversleeping a lot, as well as having troubles sleeping and staying asleep.  Usually if i don't force myself to wake up ill sleep for about 11-12 hours.  And i have been a lot more tired than usual.  However, in the past month or so things seem to be getting worse.  I'm constantly feeling tired/ weak and dehydrated.  I'm constantly thirsty no matter how much water i drink.  My skin is getting drier.  Lastnight i slept for about 13 hours and still felt like i could sleep for another few hours.  I have been finding it hard to concentrate on my studies and also have noticed my mood has been changing.  I seem to get frustrated and angry quite easily for no reason at stupid or insignificant things.  Also i think i have been just frustrated and slightly depressed with this situation since it's been going on for so long.

Anyways i thought it couldn't hurt to post this and see if anybody can shed some light on my problems.

And also im a 24 year old male 6""1 165 lbs and i have exercised and ate healthy all my life.

-5'5"" and 165 pounds; smack in the middle of the 'overweight' range
-last time I went to the doctor, which was 2 weeks ago, all my vitamins and hormone and cholesterol levels that he checked for the standard fasting blood test were okay

-pretty fucking sedentary

Why I mention Dad:

Last summer I decided 'I'll mow the lawn to get some exercise!'

Bad idea.

I started sweating profusely and puking after 15 minutes.  I had to lie down for the rest of the day.

Dad, on the other hand, is a 60-year-old diabetic and smoker who does absolutely bubkes about either of these conditions apart from taking injectable gila monster spit (exenatide/Byetta) twice a day and is 90% disabled and has a crap sleep schedule and he can mow the lawn for HOURS.  His cholesterol is high and at one point he was described by his doctor as a walking heart attack.

Googling a little more I'm reading about surgery and gaping wounds INCHES in diameter and depth, that have to heal by just being left in the open and cleaned all the time. That's so 
fucking terrifying, holy shit.

If it's my first one, are they just going to lance it? How long is that going to take to heal? Am I eventually going to have to have this huge gaping wound surgery? And shit, apparently those take 3-6 months to heal, what the fuck who has that kind of time?

I'm right on the start of my last semester of college, I can't miss the first 3 weeks of school because I cant come to class because its so painful to sit and walk. Jesus, I'm just getting high and popping tylenol all day just to manage how painful it is right now. And the earliest I can possibly see a doctor is on Monday afternoon, and then what? Can some family practitioner just lance it himself? Is it that easy? Fuck I want a specialist on this shit doing it right, with drugs and fucking anesthesia and a nurse.

Ugh, if you can share something to help me out here, I'd be mucho obrigado.

Health,Are any of these nutrition books worth reading for a beginner?,"So, I've found some nutrition books in my house. I know there are better books (as in /r/Fitness [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/Fitness#Diet1)). Do these (listed below) offer valid information? I have to change my nutrition (and I lack knowledge).

**[Pretty useless; see the list below]** I'm going to the gym (for gaining strength and muscle weight). I used to eat all kinds of crap and still be skinny. Sometimes I wondered if I've had health problems. I've also been told to eat everything I could find (for gaining muscle). But since I've joined the gym I started putting on weight and now it shows (a little) as abdomen fat. It's not much (145 lbs, 5' 9"", 22  yo) but I still have to lose some of that fat. Also, I'm sure that my daily protein intake is too low for my gym and other physical activity.

I want to take control my diet (healthy, sustainable, muscle growth).

Anyway, too much talk.** Here are the books:**

These are all the translated versions in Romanian.

I've read the 2nd listed book, but he advices to only consume fruits and vegetables. I tried to apply that, but it made me sick instead. I was mostly probable doing it wrong, too. He also says that sickness would occur naturally with drastic nutrition change, but I couldn't bear it. Also, it's very hard to consume the protein I need for the gym activity only with mostly fruits and (lesser) vegetables.

I also have one popular (in my country) nutrition book, but it's only in Romanian. The author is a TV celebrity nutritionist. He offers cool information within shiny pages. 

P.S. None of these books are written in a rigorous manner. They all seem to bend the facts to match their beliefs. I've never had a nutrition book (or any source) that explained things in much detail, in a scientific way (neither too complex, for pro's). If anyone has a suggestion, please share!

Health,"Neurological problem?  I'm certainly not asking for medical advice, but if there was a doctor, nurse, what-have-ya who wanted to give me some ideas about what to ask my doctor next time I see him, that'd be cool...","For years and years I have had these weird intermittent symptoms that my doctors have shrugged off.  I suggested vertigo and one basically just said, ""Yeah, maybe.""   After being misdiagnosed with cancer for four months (which allowed a not so huge thing to turn into something that would've killed me within the week had I not gone to the hospital) because my doctor was lazy and criminally incompetent--telling me my very real symptoms were hypochondria and anorexia (rot, ""Dr."" Coombs), I have lost all faith in any doctor besides my oncologist.  Back to the point (sorry, I tend to babble), I have three specific symptoms that seem related and I really do think it's an inner ear issue, but if there are any doctors out there willing to NOT GIVE ME MEDICAL ADVICE, but maybe a suggestion on what to ask the doc next time I see him, that would be awesome.  So here they are:

1. Feeling of whole body toppling over head first in a wheel-like motion.  Vision is also sometimes affected.

2. Feeling and vision problem where I get the sensation that my head alone is doing the above spinning wheel thing.  When it's just the head, vision is always a big part of it.  I can't focus on anything, and it lasts for a long time.  From less than a minute to about an hour with the average being about five to fifteen minutes.  It's a total spin, but I lose points of the motion.  Like, mostly it's head facing the ceiling feeling, moving to feeling like I'm gazing at my chin with barely any upside down return to the ceiling feeling until I feel like I've reached the point where I would be craning my neck backwards.  My head IS NOT actually moving.  And it's pretty fast.

3.  This is the weirdest one for me.  I don't have any sensation of my body moving with this one, but my vision does some weird crap.  Imagine looking to your far left, and then without your eyes or head moving (you aren't physically moving anything, but you can see everything moving in front of you), your vision moves to the far right side, then, without your *vision* moving left, you are back at the left and it's happening over and over again.  You're looking from your left to your right without moving your eyes or head (again, I'm not actually moving), and you never return your gaze to the left, you only see right-movement motion (sorry that's phrased weird, but I'm tired).  It never happens in reverse.

If you remember that cereal Triplex from the late 80s/early 90s, the commercials were EXACTLY what I'm describing for no.3.  I can't find any clips, or I would post them.

All of these symptoms make me dizzy, and it doesn't matter whether I am lying down, standing up, sitting, reclining, or anything.  There is no correlation with moving from a sitting to standing motion or anything like that.  Although it doesn't happen as often when I am moving.  It's usually when I'm still.  It just happens at random times about once every two weeks on average.  Sometimes a lot more often, Sometimes I'll go for two months without it happening.  I can do nothing to stop it once it has started.  I should mention that I have sinus problems, but it's mostly (ugh) post nasal drip (ugh).  Oh, this occurs mostly in the evening and at night.  Not sleep deprivation, either.
