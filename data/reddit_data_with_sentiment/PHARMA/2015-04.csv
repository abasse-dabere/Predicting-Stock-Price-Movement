medicine,"Physicians that went to medical school as non traditional students, how do you feel about your career?","I read a lot of different articles about how many doctors are frustrated, and one reason might be because they never worked in a different setting, so they don't have anything to compare medicine with (this is just stuff I've read, I could totally be wrong though). I was wondering if nontraditional students fare better in that regard or if it doesn't really make much of a difference.

So physicians who were non-traditional medical students, these are my questions:

1. What was your undergraduate degree in?

2. Did you have any other degrees before entering medical school?

3. What were the different jobs you've worked in before considering medicine, and how did you feel about those jobs (liked them, hated them, etc)?

4. Why did you consider medicine, and not anything else?

5. Did you also have any other experiences which helped solidify your decision to go to med school (volunteering, traveling, personal stuff, etc)?

6. How old were you when you entered medical school?

7. How was your experience in medical school? What'd you like or hate about it? Was it completely different from your expectations?

8. What type of doctor are you (psychiatry, pediatrics, surgery, Etc)?

9. How was residency? The work hours, the stress, environment..

10. How were your relationships throughout your journey (family, friendship, etc.)?

11. Do you enjoy your job? Do you feel that it was worth it to go through this long path?

12. Do you think you could've been happy doing something else or are you perfectly happy picking medicine?

13. Do you think you would've been better or worse off if you went to med school directly after undergrad?

14. Anything else you want to mention that I didn't cover?

Sorry for the multiple questions I had!! I'm just a confused undergrad student who is contemplating like 10 different careers I could go into",44,71,2015-04-01,PHARMA,0.05590282380580902,0.9159019589424133,0.028195170685648918

It's a recurring theme in the idea of ""be a doctor only if that's only what you could ever do,"" since the debt burden eats up nearly half of your life.

medicine,New EMT with question for experienced practitioners in Emergency Medicine.,"Some quick background about myself: I am a new (less than 1 year) experienced Emergency Medical Technician working on the ambulance. 


(I'll try to ask the question without posing any FOIP issues) 
Today I was doing a 'routine' patient transfer to a DI appointment at an area clinic. My patient was an alert and oriented 51 year old gentleman who unfortunately had a recent diagnosis of esophageal cancer but an otherwise clean medical history.


The 30 minute transport was unremarkable, the patient remained completely alert and oriented, with normal vital signs for a gentleman of his age. We dropped off this patient at his appointment and went outside to finish up some paperwork, less than five minutes later our dispatch called us to inform us that the patient had coded with the clinic staff and they needed our help.


Staff stated the patient had suffered 3 seizures and had not regained consciousness. On arrival we found the patient unresponsive with agonal respiration and a weak thready pulse. Further assessment found his pupils fixed and dilated at 6mm left and 4mm right. 4 lead cardiac monitoring showed him in a low perfusing sinus bradycardia (35bpm) that was quickly becoming slower and slower and ultimately resulted in an asystole rhythm.


We worked on him for 20 minutes before the doctor called his death.


I've been sitting here, trying to think what may have caused this patient who was completely stable; with no complaints 15 minutes prior, to have such a sudden and catastrophic change.


Obviously an autopsy will provide the only definitive answer. Does anyone have inputs into what may have been his cause of death? Initial thoughts from my partner and myself may have been a massive stroke and/or aneurysm.


Edit, thanks for the replies. 


(Some further info):


- The highest BP we managed to get was 74/36, trending downwards from there which threw me a bit (I was under the impression that some form of a CVA would increase BP). Before dropping off this patient he was trending normotensive somewhere around 136/76.


- This patient had an advanced care desingation (our fancied up version of a DNR) which he opted out of certian advanced resuscitation methods such as drug therapy, intubation, and chest compressions.


- This patient should not have been very hypoxic, staff on scene started bagging him (albeit without a proper airway) within a minute of downtime.

- The patient had a pre-existing PICC line which we ran a NS bolus during the call.

The acronym is obviously useless for searches, and when I search for the full name I just get results saying ""tell your doctor what you're taking when you have a TIPS"".

Specifically:

- are there any particular medicine safety issues after a TIPS that don't already exist in moderate hepatic impairment? I'm aware that TIPS bypasses first-pass so that's problematic for prodrugs, are there any other rules of thumb I should know about?

- does TIPS affect Child-Pugh classification at all? I presume the answer is no unless the person's lab values/ascites etc change?

I'm a California pediatrician who loves preventing disease (surprise) and can't stand all the anti-science nonsense that is spread about vaccines. A fellow pediatrician introduced a bill to require vaccines for school, period, no excuses other than a valid medical excuse. Parents will have to either vaccinate or homeschool. No more putting other kids at risk.

California bill SB 277 has it's first subcomittee hearing this Wednesday and the hoard of worried parents along with anti-science/pro-disease cranks, quacks, and chiropractors are converging on Sacramento this Wednesday. The anti-science crowd is coming out from around the country to protest. We need your help!!!!

If you live in California, please contact the members of the Senate Health Committee. A 10 second, I support SB 277 should suffice: http://www.vaccinatecalifornia.org/today_s_call_to_action_make_calls

No surprise it was going to show up again. Regardless of a position on the appropriateness of physician dispensing in general, the rhetoric is what is primarily frustrating for me in that the people pushing the bill are the extremely lucrative specialty practices (e.g., dermatologists, ophthalmologists) and then trying to play it off as 'improving access to care' to politicians that are desperate to solve the huge issue with horrible access in the western parts of the state.

There's also another bill moving through that basically would force all pharmacies to fill any prescription. It came into existence because a politician's wife is a semi-retired practitioner and let her NDI number lapse, and became frustrated pharmacies wouldn't accept the scripts she was writing for her friends. Obviously, that one most likely won't pass - but it demonstrates just how easy it would be to bury the profession with a little bit of political magic.",24,30,2015-04-08,PHARMA,0.11483683437108994,0.8537268042564392,0.03143634647130966

1  Oops. Mistake! Won't see many X-rays like this. Young girl complaining of abdominal pain. http://i.imgur.com/HoQRfAE.jpg. Yup, several of you got this right and a few described the exact same thought process I had. A colleague showed this to me (I am not the guilty party here!) and I saw the baby's spine at first and thought ""has she inserted something up there?"" because I guess I've seen a few too many crazy cases in A&amp;E. Then I saw the baby's head. It seems obvious when you know but like chest X-rays of tension pneumothoraces, you should never see this! Baby and Mum are fine :)

2 - 7. [Deleted]

8 - 9. Teenager waiting for heart transplant. Recognise everything you see? http://i.imgur.com/Qr7cayu.jpg. Unlucky lad with DCM and deteriorating whilst waiting for a heart. First one shows a complete white out and after we drained it, you might not see many chest films with more pipes! I've just realised I haven't put up the X-ray with 5 chest drains, here you only see 3. 2 on the right and 1 on the left, all at the apices. The other pipes are BiVAD cannulae.

10 Post heart transplant. Bowels not opening. Not that exciting. http://i.imgur.com/OB1Gdd1.jpg. Just a nice example of post op ileus giving an obstruction picture. You can also see pacing wires, mediastinal drains and an NG tube.

11 - 12. Stills don't do this echo justice. That thing was jiggling around like a cat in a bag. There were multiple ones, unusually in both R and L ventricles, but this was the biggest. Severe heart failure. http://i.imgur.com/AghJk0L.jpg. Referred this guy for consideration for transplant. His ejection fraction was about 5-10%, his ventricles barely moved but these pendulous masses were dancing around inside - majority consensus is they're all thrombi, but I've never seen ones so mobile and bouncy, nor in both right and left.

13 - 15. Three scans of two patients soon after lung transplant. This one's the best http://i.imgur.com/J3w6P0U.jpg. Thought you'd like to see some surgical emphysema pics - these are unusual due to the degree of air under the skin but also the shape of the lucencies. In pic 13 and 14, the air has essentially formed cavitations which are well-circumscribed, as opposed to the more typical diffuse pattern seen in 15.

medicine,Question for fellow surgeons: Do you palm your needle driver?,"I'm a urology intern finishing up my year of general surgery.  I was taught to palm my needle driver rather than putting my fingers in the holes. I used to think that all/most attending surgeons did this as well, however, I was recently operating with a plastic surgeon who trained in Canada.  He said, ""I know immediately you're from __(my medical school)___ based on how you hold your needle driver.  They put the holes there for a reason, so use them! Everyone else in the country teaches people to suture with their fingers in the holes.""

medicine,Absurdly high pain tolerance,"So a few days ago, I was working in the ER on a pretty slow day. Most of the patients were just your average run-of-the-mill sutures, closed fractures, concussions etc., and I wasn't really expecting anything to happen. 

At about 2:30, I had no patients, so I was just casually strolling around near the reception, chatting to the nurses. All of a sudden, EMS rushes a kid into the hospital, and I took over the case. I went to take the handover from the paramedics, and noticed that both had WTF expressions on their faces. They told me it was an open radius/ulna fracture, and I'd better take a look at the patient. So I do.

Get this: on that EMS stretcher is a ~12 y/o male, who's holding his fractured radius in his hand, and wobbling it like a loose tooth. He's smiling like there's nothing wrong with him at all, and he's ignoring everyone telling him to leave his arm alone.

pharmacy,Waiving medicaid copays,"I work at a specialty pharmacy and yesterday I took a call from a NP/case manager we work very closely with calling in a somewhat urgent prescription for one of her patients. I told her that if we couldn't get the med delivered by today, we'd transfer it to a local pharmacy so she could pick it up. NP tells me that the pt is worried about the copay. I tell her that she has a medicaid plan and pharmacies are legally required to waive copays if the pt can't afford them. (We're in Massachusetts.)

I make sure we have the drug in stock and we'll be able to make the delivery and I call the patient to schedule. I ask her if other pharmacies have given her a hard time about her copays. She tells me yes, that she has been refused her **HIV medication** because she didn't have seven fucking dollars. She sounded so ashamed. I was so angry for her. This is a seriously ill woman and some asshat ignorant of the law and/or on a moral high horse withheld medication where compliance *really* matters. And they were probably already judging her poorly for being HIV+.

Now, I'm hoping this is not going to devolve into a bunch of stories bashing people who abuse the system or scream about waiving copays while buying cartons of cigarettes. This was a pharmacy that broke the law and made a patient who probably was already very embarrassed about picking up those particular medications even more embarrassed. 

So if you didn't know, in Massachusetts you legally must waive a copay for medicaid patients if they cannot afford it. You must still ask for the copay. You can still bill them for it. But you can't not give them their medications. If you refuse, you can get reported to the Board of Pharmacy and probably get a nice fine.

medicine,"How to correct friends, respectfully, on medical topics?","I asked this question on a different sub and received some good feedback. I would like to hear the perspective of medical professionals who I would imagine encounter these types of situations with their patients regularly.

I have many friends who do not trust vaccinations, doctors, or modern medicine but instead subscribe to sketchy herbal ""doctors"" and ""natural"" remedies. Often I initially challenge their perspectives, but I find these are often fruitless discussions, and I do not wish to make them feel disrespected or unintelligent for their views.

However, lately I am concerned that these may be too important to pass over when they are brought up. For example, a female friend of mine refuses to see a doctor after having nonstop vaginal bleeding for months, and another friend is refusing treatment for diabetes despite being told that they have it, since a herbal ""doctor"" told them otherwise. Also I have a friend who spends ridiculous amounts of money getting ""allergies"" healed by a herbal ""doctor"".

medicine,Response to D.O. surgeon discrimination,"Hi everyone.

I wanted to take a minute and share a few of my thoughts regarding the post earlier about patients refusing procedures based on the fact that I'm a DO.  In case you didn't read the other thread:  I'm a DO gen surg attending for a touch over 25 years and this hasn't happened to me or any of my DO colleagues that I had time to ask.

What I wanted to briefly touch on was the DO discrimination thing.  First of all, yes it's a thing, and yes it's on its way out.  The old guard MD's are the ones that have given me and my colleagues a hard time in the past, and rightfully so.  Some of the DO schools were a complete joke around the time they (and I) were being trained.  But, that's not the case anymore and the appropriate belts have been tightened.  

I've probably been asked 40 times if I've experienced discrimination as a DO.  Hell yes I have.  We *all* have faced discrimination as physicians.  MD's discriminate against MD's, against DO's, men against women, one specialty against the other, etc.  For some reason in this profession we have made a conscious effort to be assholes to one another instead of playing on the same team.  So my answer to any DO students or premeds or ANY medical student in the USA or the world to discrimination - you will face it early and face it often.  I used to work in New Orleans, and I heard the bullshit of ""Oh you went to LSU?  Why not Tulane?"" more than I'd like to remember.  Who the hell has time to give a shit about any of this?  My old boss was a female Harvard trained general surgeon, and she DID have patients shoot her down for her gender.  She was the 2nd or 3rd most talented surgeon I've known, and received her training in the best hospitals and schools *in the world*.  And people still treated her like shit.  I think my point is clear.

We, as physicians, MD's, DO's, MBBS's etc (I'm sorry ND's but stay over there in Washington) need to figure our shit out and band together.  The nurses have their shit together!  We think the problem is where we all went to medical school.  Nurses are taking online courses and moving onto our turf more and more each year.  Every year the local Nursing school calls my group asking if they can rotate some NP's through with our physicians.  I've been asked by local NP's when do I think they'll let nurses start training to operate.  

Anyway, this old man is stepping off of the soap box.  My generation of doctors were dicks to each other.  We have great jobs.  Be nice to each other.  Figure your shit out. 


TL;DR - Regardless of school or gender you're going to face discrimination.  It's just part of the medical field.  It doesn't happen as much as you think once you're an attending.",122,135,2015-04-15,PHARMA,0.060449257493019104,0.9087167382240295,0.030834000557661057

medicine,Well this is horrifying Part II (chiropractor + ear infections),"The yelp page of Billy DeMoss, (the anti-vax Chiropractor) was posted yesterday in the thread. Reposting one of the reviews here, since it's pretty shocking:

&gt;It's been awhile since we went to this office, but I couldn't bring myself to actually write the review until now. My child has recurrent ear infections, had already gone through 2 sets of ear tubes + adenoid removal and was now facing a 3rd set of tubes because of continued ear infections. I read a lot of info online that suggested chiropractic adjustment can help improve drainage of fluid out the eustachian tube and avoid surgery so thought it was worth a try before going under again. I figured there was nothing to lose if it didn't work, am a big believer in addressing the cause rather than the symptom and support bringing traditional and alternative methods together to treat a condition. Unfortunately we had quite a bit to lose. The office is very nice with super attentive staff. Everyone works hard to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Dr. Bill is the only chiropractor we saw.

&gt;He told us that almost 50% of his adjustments are on pediatrics and that he was just going to be using a tiny tool to make minor adjustments. After calling around to other facilities and asking their % of pediatrics and # done for this reason, Dr. Bill seemed to be the most qualified. Traditional ENTs thought we were crazy, but I was willing to take that if it would avoid another surgery. We were told there was definitely a problem after completing the exam and xrays so we came a few times per week for at least a month. Instead of using the gentle little tool to adjust my child, he did the same big cracking type adjustments at the top of the cervical spine on my pre-schooler that he did on everyone else I saw lying on the tables. I didn't see any differentiation in approach, which concerned me, but I figured there must be minor differences that I'm not skilled enough to notice.

&gt;Within a month of adjustments here, my child had an adjustment where it hurt afterward and within 24 hours could no longer feel feet or fingers, was spiking a fever, dizzy and eyes were almost rolling back in the head. I obviously called the pediatrician and immediately began an almost year-long battle to rectify this. We went through neurosurgeons, neurologists, hematologists....countless appointments. The best guess is that the adjustment tweaked the brainstem and the inflammation led to these symptoms. It was a terrifying year and although we still have the rare bout of vertigo, we are so thankful that most everything has resolved and our child is happy and healthy once again. And, yes, we still had to do the 3rd set of tubes. I think all of us wish we could have had a different experience and I could be writing a much more positive review.

pharmacy,Feeling a little sad about work.,"I've been working in retail as a tech for a little over 5 months now (the big 3 letter chain). Every day I go to work, I can never do my job right and I feel really burdensome on everyone and really useless. I have no idea how to fix insurance rejection claims and I can't even find the right insurance in our system depending on which card the customer hands me. There are a million different types of United Healthcare, Cigna, Aetna, BlueCross, savings cards, ect. And I can't even type the numbers in right, because some insurance requires letters in the ID, some require different person codes, without letters, ect..I spend so long trying to figure this out, all of my other stations get backed up and the pharmacist is like ""What are you doing??"" and then he tells me to hand it off to someone else. At the production, I'm so slow because it takes me forever to find the medication and then I'm behind and things start turning red and then the phone rings and interrupts me and I slow down then someone comes at the drive thru then the pick up and everyone has their own separate set of issues. Then by the time I'm supposed to go back to my station it's backed up. I was working this morning and it was just me and the pharmacist and he calls the lead tech asking ""Who else is coming?"" which probably meant he didn't want to be stuck with me; the slow tech. It kind of stings a bit because I am trying so hard to figure everything out but it's just so hard because everything is in such a rush and so stressful. I've been stuck at the pick up/drive thru for the past 5 months because it's the only thing I can do half-decently. As soon as I get put into a new station I get replaced by someone because I'm too slow. I don't like being the slow stupid tech who no one can count on. This is my first job and I don't know why I can't do it right.

I used the subheadline instead of the main one to tone down the inflammatory political attitude a little.

Bottom line:

&gt; A North Carolina bill introduced this month would prevent state medical school departments from allowing employees to perform abortions or to “supervise the performance of an abortion”. Essentially, the bill’s sponsors and supporters wants to make teaching how to perform an abortion – a safe, legal and necessary medical procedure – illegal. 

edit: Like so many ill-advised bills, this one probably won't pass, but if it did would North Carolina medical schools be able to even get students?

medicine,"Anecdote From India - I Change My Mind, I have seen Homeopathy Save a Life","Wait! Do not downvote me yet! First? Read! 

I am a newbie doctor. A British doctor who studied and qualified in India currently working in rural India. 

And I know of a patient who was saved by homeopathy. 

There is a specific weirdness in Indian psychiatry. The ""non-depressed attention seeking suicide attempt"". The difference between the two is that the attempt is meant to make people guilty. See? This is what you made me do! I am so mad I could swallow a bottle of pills. 

If Indians REALLY want to kill themselves it's normally poisons such as organophos or hanging. 

This 20 something year old had swallowed a whole bunch of pills. Unknown ones. Ones I couldn't recognise. Irritated we start the standard procedure. Gastric Lavage + Activated Charcoal... 

Then a thought occurs to me. Maybe we cannot identify the pills because they aren't medicine. I ask the family to go home and get me the bottle. They didn't think it was important because ""medicine = medicine"". 

We keep treating her though. What made me think was the fact she had no derangements associated with common medications. 

The box was from Amway. Homeopathic Vitamin C. 30 C concentration to boot. It was pretty much neutral filler capsules. Suicide by homeopathy and the entire ""symptoms"" were the Placebo effect. 

I referred the patient for psychiatry care and evaluation after noting the tablets had no active ingredients that could hurt anyone. But now I am torn. What do you say to people? That the reason the woman's life may have been saved was because the pills were bogus? Would that not encourage her to try some other pills?

medicine,How do practitioners in the USA feel about all the new Medicaid under the ACA?,"I'd just be curious to read and participate in a conversation about this with the community.

I learned the other day that a friend of mine went to her usual physician (a cranky old private practice guy), and when it came up that she no longer has her former insurance and is now on Medicaid, he promptly cut short a previously helpful and in-depth conversation about an issue, gave a simple and unhelpful answer, ended the appointment, and told her not to return.

Obviously this is an extreme case and not representative of how most practitioners would ever behave, ever. It just got me wondering about the overall spectrum of opinions out there among various practitioners, and I'd like to hear how the changes have impacted you and your colleagues and what you think of the patient universe right now.

Personally, I had a minor injury recently that is requiring some follow-up care, and I've been incredibly fortunate to be back on Medicaid (it's the first time I've been covered since I aged out of Medicaid in the first place years ago), and have had a really great experience at the hospital facility I've visited. Of course, hospital context is completely different from small practices, but that's part of what I want to learn more about, the factors influencing that and influencing practitioners' attitudes.

Personally, I've only noticed improvements as far as the kind of treatment available since I've been covered again. I/my family work in peripherally related fields and are respectful to practitioners, so I tend to have good experiences/conversations with staff and get really helpful treatment under most circumstances anyway, but I still think that there's something different and more pleasant about being a Medicaid patient today than the way things worked when I was young; there's more consideration, as if (hopefully) practitioners aren't as screwed by having to treat us as they used to be. (Though I guess that doesn't go for everyone, based on jerkface-anecdote above.) Or maybe there's just been a mood/ideology shift in the industry? I don't know how the behind-the-scenes of all that looks, and I would appreciate any enlightenment. My long-term goals require learning a lot about how doctors/practitioners feel and think about things, and learning what you all need to practice the best medicine possible, so I'm happy to listen to anything anyone wants to say.

medicine,How exactly are non-private practice doctors employed?,"Please don't crap on me if this is a dumb question, but I just realized that I'm not exactly sure how working as a doctor works. I was always under the assumption that doctors go out and get jobs the same way most people do...but after some research I'm finding that doctors are largely autonomous and operate more like independent contractors given the rights to practice in a hospital. In other words, doctors don't work *for* hospitals, but rather *with* hospitals. With that said, is your average ICU, for example, just a bunch of doctors standing around grabbing the cases they want? 

In other boards, a lot of people ask about work week hours for various specialties, especially when they're making lifestyle considerations, and many will reply to the tune of ""it depends on how much you want to work"". What exactly does this mean?

&gt;It is my understanding that in the US if you are prescribed a certain drug that it is put in one of these ~~orange pill boxes/ tubes~~ amber RX vials with the prescription info on it. Why is that? I seems to me a very inefficient and dangerous system.

&gt;If I am mistaken please describe how prescription drugs are dispensed in the US.

&gt;Example here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/33oo6u/seriouswhy_are_prescription_drugs_dispensed_the/cqmxcen

&gt;EDIT: Also if prescription drugs are dispensed differently where you live than in the mentioned examples, please feel free to comment how it is done where you live.

The example:
&gt;If a US doctor prescribes you 2 150mg placebo pills a day for 30 days the doctor would give you prescription that says exactly that and you would get a pill tube with 60 150mg placebo pills, telling you to take 2 a day.

&gt;Where I live the doctor would give you a prescription for 2 boxes of 50 40 150mg placebo pills and they would come individually sealed in a plastic sheet.

* How difficult is it to open child-proof pill bottles (as in approximate age of child)?

* I've read somewhere that in the US drugs that are transferred out of their original packaging are automatically reduced to 1 year useability as a matter of law, is this true?
