pharmacy,Metoprolol and EpiPen,"My fiancee also works retail pharmacy and was recently screamed at by a mom about how the other pharmacist (floater) told her cardiologist it was ok to be on metoprolol and have an epipen. The mom sees an immunologist for allergy shots and carries an epipen, but the patient disclosed to the immunologist that she is on metoprolol and flipped shit on her. So she flipped shit on my fiancee threatening to sue her and the pharmacy for putting her in harm. 

So pharmacologically, I don't see a problem being on both? Metoprolol is a beta blocker with no alpha antagonism. Epinephrine at the dose from an epipen is mostly alpha agonism with some beta. During an allergic reaction, the principle mediators are cytokines causing vasodilation, not cardiac arrest. Thus an epipen is used to cause vasoconstriction in an allergic reaction and not stimulate the heart. 

Any thoughts?

TL;DR: Mom on metoprolol and has an epipen, immunologist flipped out, mom flipped out on pharmacist for allowing it. Pharmacology suggests there is no serious contraindication. What do you think?",26,41,2015-03-04,PHARMA,0.0932861715555191,0.8839971423149109,0.022716637700796127

medicine,"Dad Od'd yesterday, considering changing degree.","Hey guys, I'm a first year nursing student. Yesterday my dad Od'd on heroin, and my reaction has me considering changing my degree. I could really use some advice from medical professionals, and maybe someone could shed some light on how I'm feeling right now. Warning; not that any of you aren't used to it, but I'm not skipping out on any details.

My dad and brother have been heroin addicts for over 4 years now.  My brother has overdosed in the past, but I've yet to see something this gruesome. I couldn't find my dad while I was at work (family business- I run a bar to pay my way through school, he was doing work in the adjacent restaurant). I go into the back office and I see my dad completely blue in the face, slumped backwards in a chair. You know what I did? I ran away. Despite the medical training I've learned so far (I'm by no means a professional, but surely I can help someone overdosing), I ran. I gathered enough sense to call 911, but was hyperventilating and screaming to the extent that it took her a few minutes to get the address from me. 

I go back to try and get him off the chair, but he was to heavy for me to move. I push his head up in an attempt to clear his airway because he was completely slumped backwards, and then he starts hemorrhaging from his ears and mouth. So what's my reaction this time? I start vomiting all over the place. At this point he has no pulse (that I could find), and he's obviously not breathing. He's to heavy for me to get onto the floor to administer cpr despite my best efforts, he's hemorrhaging from his mouth and ears and I have NO idea what to do about it, so naturally I just loose my mind. I start screaming, punching, cursing, and tell the 911 operator I think he's to far gone. 

So that's pretty much what happened, and I did everything 100% opposite of how I should have done it. Not to mention I panicked to the extent that it interfered with anything I could have done to help him. I just have this pit in my stomach and I can't get the image of his blue face out of my head. I couldn't sleep last night, and I can't go to school because I can't stop crying when I think of the blood. I'm heavily considering changing my degree now solely based on my reaction. I don't know if it was because it was my own dad, or if my reaction with a total stranger will be the same. I've worked in hospice as a side job for a few years as well, so I'm no stranger to death. Maybe I'm just not cut out for the emergency department? Have any of you been in a similar situation?

pharmacy,"Express Scripts, a Pharmacy Benefit Manager, is gaining ground on killing your local pharmacy.","My company has provided a prescription benefit, which has worked well...until now. Express Scripts just dropped a bomb on my family. Use their mail order pharmacy or pay a penalty to Express Scripts.  After hearing this, I began to investigate further, and argue with them over this penalty.  They say we were notified. We weren't as they wouldn't discuss my wife's prescription with me even though I am the primary on the account.

Upon looking further, I find they have over 1500 BBB complaints against them along with nearly 800 one star ratings on Consumer Affairs. I've found numerous attempts by over the last 10 years to stop them from becoming a monopoly.  

Consumer complaints include medication mistakes and worse, missing deliveries that aren't replaced despite assurances to the contrary.  Obviously if some people don't get their medications, their health will take a turn for the worse.

There are 411 billing issue complaints filed with the BBB.  I believe I would be in violation of my credit cards' and bank's business agreements if I knowingly enter into a transaction with this disreputable company. 

Furthermore, how can we wait for mail order for items like antibiotics?  Do we just sit around becoming sicker while we wait for a 5 day delivery?  

Evidence has been presented to my company's HR Dept. but honestly, executives no longer care about the health and welfare of their employees.

medicine,A question for medical professionals that have dealt with euthanasia.,"Hi, I'm not a doctor, but my wife is a GP at the beginning of her career. There's this situation that has come up in her practice that I'd like to get your opinion on.

One of her patients, an elderly woman, has expressed she wants to die and she wants my wife to start a euthanasia procedure. I don't know the details of the patient's condition, but I do know that my wife takes it very seriously and has indeed taken it upon herself to help this woman. This is going to be her first time, although she's been present at one during her internships.

Now, while my wife's job is to take care of her patients, it's mine to take care of my wife, so I'd like to know as much as possible about what it is like *as a doctor* to be a part of this procedure. I want to know what I can expect my wife to go through. I'm especially curious about actually administering the drug and dealing with the aftermath. Was it easy or hard to do? Did you have any unexpected mental blowbacks? I can imagine the reality of having taken someone's life (even from one that desperately wishes for death) being a tough pill to swallow.

pharmacy,Pharmacist making a lot of mistakes...,"I am a tech, in Australia. Let's say the owner of my pharmacy owns about 5 pharmacies, let's call him Turdledove.
Turdledove is busy visiting all of his pharmacies, asking dumb questions, getting in the way, then leaving.
He will come to my pharmacy and ""help out"" dispensing scripts for maybe 3 hours a week (I believe this is something to do with keeping his Pharmacist licence or something.)
He fucks things up consistently. When I started I was told to check the Pharmacist initials when giving out a script and if I saw it was dispensed my Turdledove, I would need to recheck it myself!
We have a few customers who get free scripts for life after they received either the complete wrong medication or an incorrect strength.

Example of a simple antibiotics script:
The directions were ""1bd ibf uaf"" In Aus pharmacy world, this means ""Take one tablet twice a day immediately before food until all finished.""
He labeled it as ""Take 1bd tablet tablet""
The customer returned it the next day because it was dispensed under the wrong person (same surname, wrong first name) and because she didn't have any idea how to take the meds.

Since he never works, he rarely gets pulled up on these errors.
I am uncomfortable handing out these scripts.
I am only part-time so I am not aware of each individual incident in order to record it.
Can I do anything?

EDIT: Should have mentioned I am actively seeking a new job as I have been paid under the min wage and they are taking weeks to correct it. Also a bunch of other reasons including not paying overtime.

medicine,Physical exam findings: what you should find versus what you actually find.,"So I was writing a case H&amp;P for one of my clinical experiences, and it included a very thorough ""if it wasn't explicitly stated you didn't check it"" physical exam section. I have a pretty tough professor who wants everything to be exact and well done which is fine. The assignment was to treat this as a very thorough H&amp;P write up that you would do after an ill child/urgent primary care visit. 

I know that for smaller children, on cardiac exam there is a physiologic S2 split due to increased pulmonary pressures on inspiration and the differing resistance of the aortic versus pulmonary valve. Or, rather, there should be. But on this particular exam, I did not hear an S2 split. Also the kid was coming in for PNA and was crying during the entire exam. So I documented ""S1, S2, no S2 split, no murmurs, clicks, rubs or gallops"" under cardiac, because that's what I heard. 

My professor made a comment that S2 should be split, and that this was ""wrong"". I know that typically this would be the case, but I didn't hear it. I wasn't going to document something I didn't hear. If this was an actual write up, I wouldn't have even mentioned the S2 split not being there. 

As a student, I'm just learning, and it's not that I don't know (or can't look up) what I *should* be hearing/seeing/feeling on exam, it's just that I'm not as good at it yet because this is my first semester in clinic. I don't want to say that I heard something when I didn't. 

My question is this: how would you approach this with your students? How do you approach this in your own practice?",32,11,2015-03-07,PHARMA,0.043304696679115295,0.9073633551597595,0.049331922084093094

Edit 2: Thank you all for the advice.

medicine,Management of Atrial Fibrillation (relating to NICE Pathway),"Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this:
The NICE Pathway for managing this condition is unusually confusing.

As you can see in the pathway, leading from the initial **""Personalised package of care and information""** step are four other steps:

- *Preventing stroke*

- *Preventing and managing postoperative atrial fibrillation*

- *Acute atrial fibrillation*

- *Atrial fibrillation with stroke*


1)Aren't the first and last section both the same or they somehow different, considering this is a pathway for people with atrial fibrillation?

2) Couldn't stroke still be present in acute fibrillation despite those two being separated into separate sections?

MOST CONFUSING:
3) The pathway shows that *Controlling heart rate and rhythm* should occur after *preventing stroke*. Is this an error in the arrows as it  seems that rhythm and rate control is also important after some of the other steps such as acute AF?

medicine,Mirtazapine and sedation,"Hi all. I know this isn't the usual fare here, but I just wanted to mention something I see overlooked quite a bit. 

I work in retail, where I see a lot of prescriptions for Mirtazapine qHS, presumably for sleep. A lot of my patients /customers / guests are on Mirtazapine 30 or 45mg qHS, often with a Zolpidem / benzo HS as well. Several times I've even asked patients about this and they'll tell me they've used the mirtazapine for sleep but later had to have other medications added on as the mirtazapine started losing effectiveness, especially at higher doses. 

The problem is Mirtazapine is *more* sedating at *lower* doses, and **more activating at higher doses**. I've called several offices about this, but I've rarely seen the issue resolved. I'm not blaming the offices at all (I know how people are about alterations to their drug regimen) nor am I fully aware of the patient's needs, but it's just something I feel never gets brought up. If someone is on 15 mg of mirtazapine and is still 
having trouble sleeping, lowering to 7.5 might be the answer. At 30-45 mg, it becomes activating, and should be taken in the morning if being used for depression. 


I just wanted to mention it, and sorry if this isn't exactly the right place. I just get concerned when I see a lot of sedating medications HS along with a high dose of mirtazapine HS, and wonder how many were added on because of the mirtazapine.

pharmacy,"We have a patient who has an extreme response to opiates and like medications. Can anyone give a better explanation than the doctor saying, ""It's damn near an allergy?"" (It isn't an allergic response).","We have a 59 year old woman who is in our hospital after being admitted septic and unresponsive. Eventually, it was discovered she had a colorectal tumor and multiple ulcers that were bleeding in her GI. We pumped 700mL of blood from her stomach the first day. She ended up falling and breaking her hip in the hospital, so she required pain meds for that.

Anyway, she was first given Fentanyl 100mcg as anesthesia for her endoscopy and went into respiratory depression quickly. They had barely started the procedure. Her reaction to any pain med is very extreme. She is barely conscious, impossible to rouse for days. She also is clearly disoriented. She has a glossy look in her eyes and can barely hold more than a sentence conversation. We had a pain specialist up who started her on 2.5mg Oxy, but that caused this effect too. As did 0.25mg Dilaudid IV. There was an error where the patient was given 5mg Oxy every few hours for two days. The daughter (not the nursing staff) noticed her altered mental status and found out one of the hospitalists put her on it even though they had it listed as an allergy at this point. The med was given Mon and Tuesday. It was stopped on Wednesday. When the daughter came to visit on Friday, she noticed the patient still had altered mental status and couldn't even swallow her food. She said she kept zoning out and forgetting she was eating, so she choked on the food. They called a physician up and tried naloxone just to see if it would work because of the patient's exaggerated response in the past. The patient was unconscious when they gave the dose and she woke right up after. So it had been three days since she had a dose of Oxy and she was still experiencing the effects.

She has never really needed these meds in the past so she had no remarkable history that the family knew of. The only thing they could think of is when she was prescribed Skelaxin for muscle spasms. She apparently woke up screaming and often would fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up thinking the entire day had passed. It was dc'd shortly thereafter.

The doctors have no idea and called us. The pain specialist is useless and said, ""It's damn near an allergy."" No one has seen such a serious response to these meds before. Does anyone have any better idea? I'm truly curious as to what could cause this.

medicine,Of Homeostasis and Homeopaths,"I am not a homeopath.

Now that you have breathed a sigh of relief, let me tell you of a problem in India. See? In India there are ""alternative"" medicine providers but the problem is they are allowed to call themselves doctors. 

I am an ""allopathic"" or western medicine practitioner. Indians often don't realise that there is one school of medicine and the rest of quackery. It's a problem of a lack of education and one of pride. See? A post colonial society that has been told for centuries that they are inferior to the west now has to regain pride. Both India and China do this by promoting their traditional medicines as an opposite and equal version of medicine. While India has 300 Plus Medical Schools there are a large number of these quacks. 

And I have charted everything from homeopaths to even quack bone setters. (http://bonefracture.net/ourservices.php) No seriously, there are quack orthopaedicians out there. Yeah I know the jokes (How do you tell the difference?). Of course these places have few side effects. After all? Patients tend to come to our hands. 

I have logged everything. From toxic medicines (no seriously? One cure had eucalyptus oil in it. Cue. One Dead Child. How was a child supposed to know which medicine was for local application and which wasn't when it's been given out in a coca cola bottle?) to actual pharmaceuticals being prescribed by people whose knowledge of the human body is frankly ""magical"". 

In this case? A middle aged man came in. He had a mask like face, his jowls puffy. He complains of abdominal pain and nausea. We quickly look through his medication. He's got powders, our hearts fall. We don't even know what's in the powder. And finding out is an extra cost. We keep it aside, hoping it is something simple. Maybe gastritis. 

It isn't. The patient gets worse and worse. He starts having poedal oedema. We get an idea on the second day when a Junior house surgeon doing the morning rounds catches a fall in BP. I am the senior house officer/junior resident (I do resident work, but my rank is SHO). I call the lab to rush electrolytes. 

We start with hydrocortisone and electrolyte management. It's Addison's. 

The patient has been using steroids for 10 years to control a dust allergy as prescribed by a ""homeopath"". As there is no body regulating quacks beyond the fear of a mob reprisal, the quack goes free. The patient has to undergo careful weaning. The patient ran out of medication on a trip and thought it would be okay if he skipped a week since he wasn't coughing ""right now"". 

Iatrogenic Addison's Disease doesn't tell the story. From where I am sitting, it is easy to blame the quack. But how much of the quack's deadliness comes from a drive to do harm? Could it be this quack genuinely thinks his medicine was helping? At the core is the quack a cynical man who works for profit or is genuinely trying to help people but is let down by a flawed education?",14,23,2015-03-14,PHARMA,0.09217812120914459,0.8782827854156494,0.02953905612230301

medicine,Nurse refuses to push calcium in a code; what would you have done?,"Yesterday I witnessed a situation where a senior resident was second-guessed by an RN during a code.

The patient in question was a middle-aged man with ESRD on HD (MWF) who had missed a week of dialysis.  He was enroute to an urgent session on Saturday when he became pulseless in the back of the BLS transport.

He arrived in PEA arrest with compressions in progress but nothing else.  As soon as a PIV was established in his AV fistula, the R3 running the resuscitation asked for the RN to administer epinephrine and calcium chloride.  

At this point, the RN asks ""are you sure about the calcium?""  When the R3 confirmed the order, the RN said ""that's not in the ACLS guidelines and we don't know what the patient's electrolytes are.""  The RN pushed epinephrine but wouldn't push the calcium.

Ultimately, the resident administered the calcium themselves and an iStat chem8 came back with a K of 8.8 (shocker).  Ultimately, the code went on for 25 minutes before the patient achieved ROSC and was transferred to the neuro ICU for post-resus care and emergent dialysis.

Afterwards, the R3 tried to educate the RN in question about the importance of treating the cause of arrest, but this RN was adamant that they weren't going to push the calcium without a lab value for potassium.  They said that doing so would expose them to legal liability and could result in the loss of their license for not following established guidelines.  They even suggested that the R3 was opening themselves to liability by acting ""like a cowboy.""

To me, the case seems pretty clear.  Even the AHA guidelines state that you need to identify and treat the causes of PEA arrest in addition to providing quality CPR and using the indicated ACLS drugs.  The obvious reason for this patient's arrest was hyperkalemia; the clinical suspicion for which was so strong that it would be reasonable to make the diagnosis on history and ECG alone.

What this really illustrates to me is the difference in thinking between physicians and nurses/support staff.  When a doctor makes a clinical decision, they can back it up by stating it is their ""medical opinion.""  When a nurse wants to make a clinical decision, they defer to guidelines and back it up with the threat of legal liability.

I'm curious what meddit has to say about the above and perhaps how they would have handled the situation.",284,357,2015-03-15,PHARMA,0.07074914127588272,0.8972295522689819,0.03202138841152191

medicine,"A clinical dilemma, maybe someone here can participate.","Just something I encountered during yesterday's shift:

2015.03.09: Male, ~65 years old, brought to emergency department with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome, inferior wall STEMI is confirmed, thrombolysis performed. Initial Troponin I is &gt;8. Quickly after he develops right side hemiplegia, gets transferred to my university hospital's intensive cardiology care unit, where head CT reveales a left hemisphere intracerebral hemorrhage with blood in the ventricles. Angiography is not performed. Gets a neurosurgery consult, who decides that he shouldn't operate. Patient is conscious, sensory and motor aphasia. Also, he has a permanent AFib in his history.

2015.03.12: still in the ICU, patients consciousness gets worse according to other doctors' records, but unclear how worse. He get's a neurology consult, head CT is repeated that shows the hematoma is disintegrating, smaller, edema is milder as well, no structural disclocation, however, there's a subarachnoid hemorrhage frontoparietooccipitally, subtentorially. Surprisingly, nothing is done at this point, he just gets a neurology consult and is transferred to Neurology department, still with worse consciousness. Attending resident who is not from neurology admits him, does not prescribe anything needed for a patient after acute coronary syndrome, basically, just liquids.

2015.03.14 (my day shift): Patient does carry out commands on demand (might be due to sensory and motor aphasia), does not open his eyes in response to painful stimulus, tries to localize painful stimulus. Pupils are equal, reactive. Right hemiplegia. Bilateral Babinski signs (unclear when they became bilateral). All in all, seems to be getting slowly worse according to previous records. I repeat a head CT - everything's more or less the same, not worsening, SAH signs are still there, get a neurosurgeon's consult (1st time after the consciousness worsened) - operation is not indicated. Troponin is still high, &gt;5. I start him on an ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, can't start him on statins because we don't have them, then comes the usual dilemma about anticoagulants and antiaggregants. Patient's immobile (thromboembolic prophylaxis is needed), has a permanent AFib and just had a STEMI, however, now he has an intracerebral haemorrhage with protrusion to ventricles and SAH (which is probably the same blood from the ICH, just circled through the whole CSF system).

So, would you give him small molecular weight heparin subcutaneously? Aspirin, Clopidogrel?

...discuss..!

medicine,"[Update] Former surgery resident changing to IM, no success in the match. What are my options?","Hey meddit. I made a post several months ago about my plans to switch to Internal Medicine from Surgery. I got a lot of great advice in that thread and I was hoping for some more of the same. The breakdown was basically this:

I graduated from a US medical school in the second quartile, great board scores. I decided really late on Surgery and matched into a good prelim spot that I worked at for a year, then moved into a categorical position this year. I performed well at both positions, but I found that surgery really isn't for me. I wanted to switch into internal medicine as it was the part of my residency so far that I'd enjoyed most and I found it very engaging and interesting.

I had gotten a lot of positive feedback from my institution, as well as calls from my PD and some senior staff that I was a lock for a position in internal medicine at my home institution. But we all know how match-related promises go, so here I am without a position. 

I have a degree and a couple years worked with a completed intern year. I'm pretty sure I did well on step 3 but won't find out until April. I'm going to try the scramble, but I know that if I can't get a position at my home institution with senior staff here vouching for me, I don't have much of a chance someplace where no-one's ever heard of me. As a side note, due to the time course of changing my field, the only program that would offer me an interview was my program here. 

I'm wondering what my options are. Are there any positions for someone with my background that I could do for a year while I retry at the match again next year? I have an unusual partially-done-but-not-really residency education, but that's all. I know that I have the option of another preliminary year in medicine through the scramble, but I've already had a prelim year and thinking about another year for no credit makes me seriously depressed.

medicine,Any other doctors considering early retirement?,"Brand new throwaway account for this one. I'm in my early 40's in a surgical subspecialty. Been practicing for 10+ years. Super busy practice -- I'm pretty good at what I do.

The thing is, I save a lot of my income, and have been since I've started. Have enough that I should be able to retire now, and I want to.

Tired of the work. Tired of the responsibilities. Tired of the demands from patients (some of which are completely legitimate ... some of which are less so).

So ... crazily enough, I'm thinking about walking away. Just ... stopping. It seems completely crazy, though. I've spent 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, and 6 years combined in residency/fellowship (14 years). If I retired now, I'd have spent more time training for my profession than practicing. And the job does have its moments - when patients do well, they truly are grateful, and there is definitely a level of satisfaction that comes with a job well done. I don't suspect that I would ever be able to find a second career at this stage in my life that I could either A. make even close to the income I make now, or B. have as much of a positive effect on people's lives.

On the other side, the hours are kind of killer. And I'm tired. And perhaps most importantly, I am financially able to retire.

I see my colleagues working into their 60's and 70's, and I just can't understand it. So I guess my question to /r/medicine is, am I alone here? Am I crazy? Are all of you still in love with medicine, passionate about what you do, and planning to work until you drop? I feel like I've made a terrible life choice -- everyone else seems to love their career, and I feel like I'm the only one desperate to get out.

Or is this the new face of medicine? Are doctors in my age range just less satisfied with their careers (perhaps due to all of the changes in medicine that have happened over the past 20-30 years)?

medicine,Transgender patient history and disclosure; Am I being insensitive?,"I'm currently having a discussion on another thread that basically stemmed from this highly abridged story: 
A female to male transgender patient was given a ID band that said ""Female""; their birth sex as opposed to ""Male""; their current gender.

I understand how that could upset a patient but in an emergency situation I think clinicians need to know that they have a biologically female patient. But, others feel that by asking these types of questions and forcing transgender patients to disclose this history, clinicians in some way denigrate the patient and furthermore, that once a patient has transitioned to a certain point, disclosing they are transgender in unimportant. 

For me, the need for accurate patient history outweighs the need for someone feelings. For a patient not to disclose such important information just seems irresponsible to me. 

My question is, where do you as clinicians, draw the line in these situations with regards to the transgender community? Is my thinking out of step with current practices? I am active in the lgbt community and would greatly appreciate your input.",145,146,2015-03-23,PHARMA,0.04861252382397652,0.9160411357879639,0.0353463739156723

medicine,"Physician thoughts on nursing in general. Relevance, need, purpose etc. (better explanation in comments)","I'm currently taking an online bridge program from ADN to MSN. Right now the class I'm enrolled in is all about various nursing theories. I'm about to lose my mind. Rogers theory is all about how patients and nurses are energy patterns and how nurses need to create an energy pattern and intuitively treat patients. Other theories are all about our role is separate from the medical aspect and should have a holistic gestalt approach to the patient as a whole and how nurses ""grow in caring""  etc. Some of it seems like nursing in general is trying to justify it's very existence. Much of it seems laughable to me. I personally view nursing as essential to the Healthcare process because physicians have many many times the number of patients in their service compared to me (in the ER I have up to 4 patients at a time, physicians sometimes have 30-40 depending on time of day and patient volume).  I see it as the doctor is the captain of the ship and the nurse is the pilot. Physicians know boatloads (heh)  more than I do, but I know the individual patient better because I can focus on them. What do you guys feel about this? This theory class is implying that my job is to be warm and fuzzy to every single person and bond with them, and seems to downplay the medical aspect. What is your view? Also, any nurses who have an MSN or a BSN please tell me that I need to just grit my teeth and get through this crap and hold out for the advanced pathophysiology and pharmacology courses later.

medicine,MS4 who also didn't match. I could use some advice.,"Hey everyone. I’m posting a little about my story as an unmatched student because of the recent blog post from the OHSU student. I noticed there was some great advice there and I was wondering if people who are somehow involved in academic programs might be able to help me given the fact that I’m receiving a little conflicting advice from people I trust.

For the sake of your sanity, I’ll include my relevant history [here](http://pastebin.com/P2pzw166)

If you would like to read it I would appreciate it. However, I think these questions are broad enough to hopefully apply to anyone else in my situation.

I have a few questions:

1.	Do additional degrees look good on an application? MPH? MBA? One mentor recommended Teach for America. This seems unusual.

2.	Do you recommend I do realistic away rotations?

3.	Would a prelim year look better than remaining enrolled?

4.	Any additional strategies that have helped those who unmatched the first time succeed the second?

I also wrote my feelings down to share with some of my closest friends and family. Putting what I feel down on paper helped and I’m glad I did this. The support has been overwhelming.

Also not allowed and will be removed are posts by lay people asking general or specific questions about medical conditions, prognosis, medications or other treatments.

Please post those kind of questions to /r/AskDocs

Posts by redditors who rarely post to /r/medicine and whose history suggests they are mainly concerned with pushing their own agenda will be removed. This subreddit is for medical professionals primarily, not for lay people with an ax to grind about a particular health issue.

I am a student in my clinical rotation semester (my last of undergrad) pursuing my degree in medical lab science. After which I'll take my BOC and be a Medical Laboratory Scientist certified by the ASCP. In my experiences as a student (I'm in the lab 5 days a week 8 hours a day) I have heard a complaints fairly regularly about other hospital personnel. Nurses, doctors, basically anyone. From my limited experience outside of the lab, I haven't heard much criticism of it. I was curious if you all could explain any complaints you've had with a lab and how they could have been better resolved. I understand that every place of employment is different, but I've noticed some themes in complaints of other staff among my classmates at other hospitals. I would definitely like to understand the stresses of everyone else so that I can work cohesively with my fellow healthcare professionals at my first real job. How can we, the laboratory, better assist you?

medicine,Please considering joining the newly created /r/trauma,"Hi Meddit, I've made a subreddit - /r/trauma - for the multi-disciplinary field of traumatology with the goal of including pre-hospital providers, emergency medicine physicians, surgeons and intensivists.  I'd love if you'd come join in and help make this community thrive.  My goal is to grow the subreddit to include a journal club and maybe discussions around specific podcasts and rounds sessions, such as the EMCrit blog or the AAST grand rounds seminars.

Why make a new subreddit?

Sometimes, a question can have such a narrow scope that a broader medical community has no interest.  For example, what is the existing evidence in support of laparotomy for abdominal decompression in the management of increased ICP?  Does remote ischemic conditioning minimize secondary brain injury in TBI?  Is pre-peritoneal packing in the OR superior to external fixation in exsanguinating pelvis trauma?  Should EMS personnel deliver TXA to every trauma patient with a transport time greater than 3 hours in case they later go into shock after the therapeutic window is closed?

Furthermore, modern trauma is a team-sport by design.  ER docs, surgeons, paramedics... we're all spokes in a wheel.  I'd like /r/trauma to be a community for all of these players to share their experiences, pet peeves, and gratitude for one another so that we can improve as a team together.

Thanks for considering it, I hope to see you there!
