medicine,I don't know who to talk to about this. I keep getting erections while examining patients and it's making me want to quit medicine,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've been practicing medicine for 3 years now and this has been a problem for me since the start of medical school. Every time I perform an intimate examination on a female patient, I will get an erection.

Whenever I perform a breast, PR or PV examination I always make sure to have a chaperone with me and this still happens. I do not think anyone has noticed yet but the day someone does it will completely ruin me. I originally thought this was just due to nerves, and as I got more confident and did these examinations more often they would go away, however this has not been the case.

To clarify, in no way do I find the situation ""sexy"" at all. It's not something I fantisize about or play out in my head. These situations terrify me more than anything and they are not something I look forward to.

I grew up in a very sheltered home and I've never had a girlfriend or had any sexual contact with the opposite sex. I believe this may be partially responsible but I would have thought with repeated exposure, this would be less of an issue as time went on.

I'm not sure what to do regarding this problem. I guess what I'm looking for is advice from anyone who has gone through something similar or any practical tips I can use. Flexing my thighs to get rid of an erection has had some success but I'd prefer not to get them in the first place.",42,40,2014-06-01,PHARMA,0.061705101281404495,0.9034742712974548,0.034820642322301865

medicine,Apple Healthkit and Apple Health ties to EMRs,"I don't know if anyone else is a big enough Apple fan to watch their WWDC keynote speech, but they are releasing a new app in the near future that consolidates health information from the multitude of iPhone and iPad accessories into a centralized program on their devices/account called Apple Health. You can [find the keynote here](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2014/) and he talks about it around the 70th minute.

I am getting ready to start medical school in my thirties and have an extensive background in Web/App development so I'm constantly daydreaming about how I would build an EMR to the point that I have several screens designed and quite a bit of the functionality documented. This new application and some of the other features that tie devices together brought up a new fascinating idea for me: 

&gt;Physician: Here are the results of your CBC and other blood work. Everything looks good with a few exceptions...

&gt; [discussion continues]

&gt;
Patient: Can I get a copy of that?
&gt;
Physician: Sure. Do you happen to have an iPhone?
&gt;
Patient: Yes.
&gt;
Physician: Turn on Airdrop real quick and I'll send it and your last two tests so you can have them for your records. Grab the Apple Health app and it will automatically store and graph them for you so you can see how you're progressing.

Many of our patients are worried about cloud access to their records and this would be a much more secure way to allow the patient to travel with their health information in my opinion. The patient could always lose their phone but phones can be wiped remotely.

After working with an EMR at various positions throughout the office for the past five years, I know how the rest of the office flows. Obviously I need more experience before I know how I want the note building portion to flow, but I've trained three physicians and PAs how to use our current one so I've got some insight there as well. 

I've been reading some of the other posts looking for suggestions as well and many of my critiques line up with much of what I'm seeing.

I also have a PhD in neuropharmacology which I've not really done anything with (I was a bit burned out after my MD/PhD program). With my mother having been diagnosed with Lewy body dementia I've recently developed an interest in dementia research. I already have some ideas for research projects, but am unsure how to make the transition. I suppose I could look into joining a teaching hospital that permits research opportunities. Otherwise I could look into a geriatrics fellowship.. heck, it's just one year and hospitalist medicine is 90% geriatrics anyway. It would feel very odd however, being back in the position of student.. particularly when I may be more experienced than my supervisor. Does anyone have experience with transitioning from attending to fellow?

medicine,I’d like to rant about how everyone is telling me I’m drowning in debt.,"Hey Meddit,

I’ve finished my residency in physiatry, a dream come true at a price of 550K. No typos and including my undergraduate debt. I’ve learned to keep this number secret because once I tell someone, they panic and ask, “Why is it so big?” Well…

I went to an expensive undergraduate institution. My parents were going to make payments until I was done with professional school; then I could pay the rest. Unfortunately, my parents fell into financial trouble. I refinanced so that they were no long cosigners and could eventually help my brothers through college. I had to defer my undergrad loans for years, allowing the interest to have a large party all over the principal. Then I went to medical school, which was also all paid for in loans. Voila. And that’s how it happened.

But my reason for this post is not to complain about why my debt is the way it is. Rather, I’m being told in multiple ways that my life must suck and I made a terrible mistake. Society’s reaction makes me feel far more insecure than the actual debt itself. The debt simply says, “Hey, live resourcefully and pay me.” But everyone else says, “That’s ridiculous. You’re going to be miserable.”

Here’s my current financial breakdown: I make 10k per month after taxes. Of that 10K, 2.5K goes into my basic living expenses and savings. 7.5K a month goes into loans. In essence, I’m living on a 30K per year salary (after tax) by dedicating 75% to repayment. In seven years, I’ll be debt free. And honestly, 30K per year is very comfortable for me. After those 7 years, I will probably continue to live on 30K and invest the rest.

I wish I had better planned for unexpected financial hiccups but it’s what I pay to do what I absolutely love without compromising my sibling’s pursuit of higher education. I should also add that I am not interested in ever having kids or buying a family home.

TLDR: I have a lot of student loan debt and I’m dealing with it. No pity parties.",124,236,2014-06-06,PHARMA,0.06883581727743149,0.9053847789764404,0.02577938325703144

pharmacy,Next Steps as Community/Retail Pharmacist,"I have been working as a retail pharmacist for about 4 years now and have been a manager for the past year. Coming out of pharmacy school, I thought I would hate retail, but turns out, I love it. I f*ing love it. I am, of course, lucky enough to work in a retail chain that allows me enough help and time to actually know my patients and them to know me. I have been the manager for the past year, and it has been okay, but I have had to give less time working with my patients so that I can handle the administrative tasks (script count, schedules, etc.). I do not think this is where I want to be long term (ie, going up the corporate ladder or even staying a manager). I am looking for advice on how to further my career. I want to do more with patients on an out-patient basis. I am considering getting my BCACP as an option, but as far as I can tell, in my state it doesn't amount to much. We have no way for pharmacists to be prescribers or see patients and we have very few clinic-based pharmacists. I see some schools offer dual degrees with a Masters as a Physician Assistant so I was thinking maybe that would let me do more direct patient care. Any thoughts on how I can do more of the best parts of community pharmacy?

medicine,What do you think of this situation? 16 mexican doctors of the national social security institution were arrested for 'culpable homicide' of a 16 year old child. I translated the story for you.,"Here is the original [news article](http://www.lajornadajalisco.com.mx/2014/06/05/por-homicidio-culposo-16-ordenes-de-aprehension-contra-medicos-del-imss/) (in spanish)

Which states: 
&gt; Four years after the trial, last May 20, the ^long-ass-title federal judge issued 16 arrest warrants and a detention order for culpable homicide arising from medical malpractice against the doctors and those responsible for the unit of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) Intensive Care Unit on the *Centro Médico Nacional de Occidente* for the death in 2010 of Edivaldo Roberto Gallardo.

&gt; The child's father, Sergio Valente Ramos Gallardo said that despite this, still four arrest warrants are still to be issued, against Dr. José de Jesús Dávila Arriaga, general director of the IMSS; Dr. Miguel Leon Raymundo Guzman, Medical Director of the Medical Unit of High Specialty (UMAE); Carmela and Irma Rodríguez Rodríguez, head of the Intensive Care UMAE and Rosa Elena de la Torre Gómez, responsible for carrying out the medical certificate, 

&gt; In January 2010, medical malpractice caused the death of the child Edivaldo Roberto Gallardo Rodríguez, who was admitted on November 15, 2009 at the pediatric emergency department of the Medical Unit of High Specialty IMSS affected by an asmathic crisis.

&gt; While in the hospital, he underwent seven surgical abdominal operations (exploratory laparotomy), placing two subclavian, these catheters pierced lung and intestinal sections. Roberto recovery wasn't allowed during the process, causing abdominal infection and death due to deteriorating health. [*wtf? where the fuck did the get this from?*]

&gt; Apparently, and according to an autopsy requested by the parent to the Forensic Medical Service (SEMEFO), the minor was actually admitted with an intestinal tuberculosis was not detected from the beginning, which was complicated because of all processes. The results of the autopsy were partially different from those contained in the death certificate issued at the IMSS, where sepsis (infection) abdominal transcribed, omitting the origin of it.

&gt; To the coroner Alfredo Rodríguez García, authorities and medical personnel committed negligence, omission and incompetence by acting improperly and skip processes: ""Here was a situation of neglect and omission, combined with a bit of imperice. What should have the medical coordinator who was in charge done? He must have met the medical team and review the case; a collegial review it should have done. ""

&gt; García Rodríguez explained at a press conference, which should have a pathologist present during all surgical procedures and have been so from the first intervention could have pointed out that he had an intestinal tuberculosis.

&gt; Also reported that although the 16 doctors covered and presented to the authority to sign, does not necessarily trample prison for crimes that reach be bond or bonds by suspending this staff.

&gt; With the support of José Luis Guizar Abarca, representative of the Association of Criminal Lawyers of the State of Jalisco and the coroner Alfredo Rodríguez García, Sergio Valente Ramos Gallardo, father of the child, waiting to be cleared, and justice for all will lift the voice about the medical care of that institution.

&gt; ""What I want is to set a precedent for the beneficiaries have another deal. The next step is to ask them to withdraw their card and their dependents. ""In addition, Ramos Gallardo said he felt"" morally worn and sad because I'm fighting a monster. ""

&gt; They stated that this is one of the largest cases in the history of IMSS, to sue 16 employees of that institution medical malpractice. 


What every article is **NOT** stating: The child had asthma since 4 years old, with no care from his family, he was helping his father on his job with wood varnish. The child was over 100kg of weight, and also suffered from diabetes mellitus type 2, with no adhesion to treatment. When the child ingressed hospital he wasn't having an asmathic crisis, he was shock secondary to perforated intestine.

It's all fuzzy on details of his hospital admission and what happened during, but it's all slowly being made public.

Personally, I was curious if there's any real difference from one topical antifungal to another. I usually recommend Terbinafine (Lamisil®), but I've seen other pharmacists who always recommend Clotrimazole (Lotrimin®). Does it matter?  
  
I found this document, apparently prepared for the Oregon government, that summarizes a bunch of data: http://www.oregon.gov/oha/pharmacy/therapeutics/docs/ps-2010-02-antifungals-topical.pdf  
  
My takeaway is that the Allylamine antifungals (Terbinafine, Amorolfine, Naftifine, etc) work a bit quicker and might work a bit better, but on long term followup cure rates are pretty similar between these agents and the Azole antifungals.

medicine,NP to MD?,"All right. I've been lurking on this sub for a while. I was just accepted in to a Nurse Practitioner program for Acute Pediatrics. I'm really excited to attend, and learn more about medicine. I've wanted to be a midlevel for the last three or four years. 

However, I don't think it'll be enough for me. I'm in my last semester of an accelerated BSN program, and I've been spending a ton more time in the hospital. As a result, I've seen what attending physicians do, and what midlevels do, and the former is where I want to be. I've also become a bit disillusioned with NP school (I'm going to a major state university with an excellent NP program- no diploma mills for me), and the type of practitioners that it tends to produce. 

I love medicine. I love differentials, and pharmacology and anatomy and science. 

However, in order to attend medical school I'd have to re-take all my pre-requisites and take the MCAT. This is not an insurmountable task, but it is an obstacle. 

Currently, my plan is to attend NP school, get my masters (1.5-2 years), then practice while taking pre-requisites for med school and the MCAT. I'm not looking for shortcuts, and I know that I would have to pretty much re-learn everything I've learned in nursing school, practice, and NP school. 

Physicians and midlevels alike, I'd like your advice on this. I know the time requirement is an issue, but does this sound like a good plan? Midlevels- do you wish you had gone to med school? Why or why not?

pharmacy,Question about pharmacy longevity and pursuing other careers (i.e. med school).,"I'm a current P4 student and I'm a little concerned about pharmacy as a profession, the longevity of my career, and my financial future.

I'm currently starting my rotations and I'm wondering what current pharmacists opinions on this matter is. Pharmacists that I've talked to are not 100% in agreement with what the outlook of the career is and I'm starting to get a little nervous.

My current options that I'm looking into are: 

1)Residency

2)Retail + med school

3) Residency, job, then med school

4) Other? (PA school?)

I guess I will have to disclose a little information for you to get a better picture. I have a lot of pharmacy work experience, have decently hard rotations (i.e. clinically oriented), GPA ~3.8, undergraduate degree (BS in Bio, GPA ~ 3.7), organizational leadership, and mostly geared my pharmacy student career towards obtaining a residency. (I am lacking in the research department, however. )

The competitiveness of residency and the lack of jobs that follows concerns me. I wouldn't like to completely commit myself to a residency and then find myself working retail afterwards. Additionally, I'm not entirely interested in anything but the clinical aspect of pharmacy. If I was to do something that isn't clinical, I would like informatics, but that is another residency-acquired position. i thought about doing med school after pharmacy, but I would have to work first because my financial situation does not allow me to go right away. I also do not want to apply to med school as a pharmacist (in retail) and get stuck there either. I guess I'm between a rock and hard place and I'm not really sure what to do. I figured that if I were to do a med school route that I would do retail, get paid more, and then shorten my time to getting into it. I've also heard concerns about MDs being overly saturated in some areas, but I'm not entirely sure about what is going on in their field. I've also thought about getting a PA, but spending thousands of dollars to get another degree to earn the same pay (or less) does not seem enticing. One benefit, however, is that PAs are more in demand and have a more rewarding job (in my opinion). What is your opinions everyone? Sorry about the long post and thanks for any responses!


ALSO: for those who know a pharmacist who ""switched"" to med or some other field, were they able to work part-time as a retail pharmacist?

medicine,"I posted this question on ELI5 but perhaps it belongs here: If $2.8 trillion is really being spent on health care in the US, where is the money going?","I found the document put out by CMS [itemizing all health care expenditures they could find for 2012.](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/highlights.pdf)


 Going over it, it appeared to be rather comprehensive yet, the numbers just didn’t add up. I’ll show you what I mean:

* Hospital care- Total amount spent towards all hospitals including inpatient and outpatient costs: $882 Billion

* Physician and clinical services- How much doctors are paid including the overhead for their practices: $565 billion

* Other professional services- Physical therapy, occupational therapy, podiatry, optometry, chiropractors: $76.4 billion

* Dental services: $110.9 billion

* Other health services: School nurses, ambulances, substance abuse treatments, etc...: $138.2 billion

* Home health care: $77.8 billion

* Nursing homes: $151.5 billion

* Prescription drugs: $263.3 billion

* Durable medical equipment: $41.3 billion

* Other products- OTC medicines, bandaids, gauze, etc...: $53.7 billion

Add all of this up and it totals $2.3604 trillion! That’s $440 billion less than than the $2.8 trillion they claim was spent that year.

Now I could argue with some of these numbers. For example, was $565 billion really spent on physicians in 2012? according to [the kaiser foundation](http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-active-physicians/) there about 835,000 physicians in the US in 2012 which means about $675,000 was spent on every doctor in 2012.

The average spent on each doctor was $675,000? Even if you assume that a third of that went toward overhead for the doctor’s office that leaves an average of over $400,000 going to each doctor. That’s more than [twice the average](http://healthland.time.com/2012/04/27/doctors-salaries-who-earns-the-most-and-the-least/) doctors in the US actually make (and well over twice what I make and I'm a doctor).

But even if these numbers are true, what happened to that $440 billion? That’s half the pentagon budget.

Looking at it another way, page 2 itemizes health care spending by source. Again, lets do the math:

Total Medicare spending: $572.5 billion

Total Medicaid spending: $421.2 billion

Private health insurance premiums: $917 billion

Out-of Pocket spending by patients: $328.2 billion

Total for all: 2.2389 trillion! Now we’re missing over $560 billion. I assume CMS knows how much money is spent by Medicare and Medicaid because it’s their money. So... $572.5 billion is all that was spent on taking care of the elderly and disabled in the US? Only one in five dollars spent on health care was went toward those most likely to get sick?

What am I missing here? Could someone please explain this?

**Update:** Someone provided [these tables](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/tables.pdf) which show the missing numbers that weren't in that itemized summary. They're really worth going over since they show how the cost of health care in the US exploded between 1970 and 2006 but has slowed considerably since 2008.

medicine,I wrote a short 'story' about my first year at medical school.,"Or perhaps it would be more classed a 'blog'. Regardless, I made a new reddit account for the sake of anonymity and I plan on doing entries at least once a year, unless an event motivates me to write more! Let me know what you think.

**1**

 The years of hard work that had led up to my first day were filled with delirious fantasies of what it would be like when I finally started medical school. I was convinced that I would be excited enough to burst out of my skin and greet my teachers and colleagues a translucent bag of muscle, bones and organs. Instead I found myself completely calm, on reflection I think it was disbelief that I was finally here. A little older than most people would expect a student to be entering medical school but nonetheless here I was. Standing in this absolutely magnificent building. I was half worried that they’d be a flustered red-faced admin bursting through the doors of the lecture hall as I sat, in awe, surrounded by other excited baby medics, the air dense with emotion.


 In the past I’ve had my share of battles with my own mental health and it shows its effects even now, despite that now I identify as someone who is not an active sufferer. I do not think they are all negatives, in fact I think most, if not all, are positive, at least neutral. Firstly, I’m a sensitive person, in this I mean I am not constantly crying or screaming but I can’t help to tune in to what other people are feeling and, though I conceal it well, I take things said about me personally. I can’t break promises and am fiercely loyal and I struggle NOT to forgive. I have an overwhelming desire to help those that are suffering and I am a very patient and receptive listener. Unfortunately, and perhaps not wholly negative, I find myself lacking in self esteem greatly and feeling insecure. In some respects it means I am cautious and don’t take or make decisions lightly but it means some nights are spent with red, wet eyes, damp cheeks and a tired heart. 


Until you go home after a long day at medical school, your clothes thick with the potent odour of spending hours in a sterile room filled with a dozen, or more, embalmed dead bodies you will not fully appreciate the ‘smell of death’. Formaldehyde and the other chemical lovelies used in the preservation process stick to absolutely everything and a 45 minute scrub was essential to feeling clean afterwards. But what also stuck with me, especially when I first entered that room, a terrified ball of uncertainty and left at the end of the year, a slightly-frayed-around-the-edges ‘veteran’ was that they were not ‘dead bodies’. They were people.  I remember vividly how I felt during the dissection of the upper limb as I assisted a colleague who was dissecting and I couldn’t help but feel sadness when I touched the hand of the body. wondered how many people had held their hand in their lifetime especially in their, and shortly after, last moments of breathing. 


For me, sometimes it really hurts to be a medic. Don’t misunderstand me, I am already painfully aware of the amount of responsibility that I will bear on my shoulders during my career and how critical it is that the decisions I come to are right. But it’s not that. It’s the suffering of the others around you that makes it hurt. I read in the book ‘Do No Harm: Tales of Life, Death and Brain Surgery’ that doctors can’t suffer enough. And I think they’re right. No matter what stresses and pressures medics face it is nothing comparatively, is it? Patients and their families are often feeling their lives spiralling out of control. They are burdened with pain, uncertainty and often confusion about their situation. Communication from medics is so fundamental, a helping hand as they feel themselves sinking.


I wrote a letter to myself on my first day, and I intend to carry on this tradition for every year of medical school, maybe even my medical career. I included the quote ‘I told you to be patient, I told you to be kind’. I hope that this year I have followed through with this, taking a minute to ask a colleague how they are, smiling at people, making time for those that are struggling. I don’t know what lies ahead, this year has already been one full of overwhelming highs and crippling lows. However, I will remember to be kind and I will strive to be patient.",4,33,2014-06-18,PHARMA,0.10838475078344345,0.8664875626564026,0.025127656757831573

pharmacy,"Pharmacy Workers in the USA, what's the deal?","I'm an Australian pharmacy tech. Our government has a scheme that involves subsidizing medicines for ""life-threatening"" conditions. For low income earners, they pay $6 per medication, for everybody else they are $36.90, this cost goes up every January. After you buy a certain number of medications per year, you pay a reduced amount ($6 for general patients, free for low income earners.)

Medicines that aren't covered cost varying prices depending on which pharmacy you go to. $10-$15 for general antibiotics, $30-$80 for contraceptive pill, etc.

The customer comes to the pharmacy and hands in their script. We check the details and place in the cue. 
The techs usually gets the script and scans the barcode, this brings up all information, patient details, doctor details, medicine details, etc. we check it all and press enter. We print a label, go get the item, scan the label and then the item to verify it is correct. We label it up, sticker the government copy of the script and then staple the repeats with the original script. The pharmacist then checks the script, and it is handed out. The customer takes their item and their repeats.
When they need a new prescription filled, they take the repeat to any pharmacy and they fill it.

Obviously things can go wrong, handwritten scripts that aren't readable, items out of stock, odd dosages that need to be checked with doctor, etc. It may not always go that way but that is a general description. 

I just wanted to understand how it works in the USA.
From what I've seen on Reddit, your script stays at one pharmacy and you need to call to transfer it, and everybody has to get ""insurance"" but don't seem to know what they will be paying. It seems a lot more complex than what I'm used to!
Could somebody please explain it to me? Thanks!

EDIT: Wow, much respect to you guys! You should be paid more!
We have it so easy here... We don't even ""count pills."" Doctors write scripts for a box of 30 Lipitor 20 so we go to the L Section, find the box marked Lipitor 20 30 tablets and put a label on that.

pharmacy,Awful float shift,"I had a call today from my scheduler and went to a local pharmacy to cover for the usual pharmacist for a few hours for a family emergency.  
  
This was my first time working alone as a pharmacist in 3+ years and it was a bad experience. It seemed like every other prescription was for narcotics, so I was running back and forth to the safe, the log book, etc. The scanner was broken so my tech couldn't scan any new Rxs and so I had an extra step in my workflow to scan the hard copies while doing product verification. I don't know if the techs were being lazy or this is how it is supposed to go, but it seemed like they didn't count anything. The prescriptions would come to me with the labels and bottles in the baskets, but still needing to be counted.  
  
I got really backed up and one guy was waiting for his Rx for like an hour. It was truly ridiculous. I felt a bit like I was having a panic attack, my face was flushed and I could feel my heart beating rapidly. I took a few deep breaths and carried on.  
  
I'm trying to do a bit of a ""postmortem"" to figure out what happened, exactly.  
  
First, I think I need to be more assertive. I think the tech (just one tech with me most of the time) knew that I was new and took advantage of the situation. When labels and bottles come down to me, I need to tell the tech to count them if I'm backed up.  
  
Second, I need to keep calm, even if I'm overwhelmed. People might get mad if they have to wait a long time, but I can't rush things and make a mistake. I know some pharmacists who just don't give a sh!@ anymore and just rush through verification and make a lot of mistakes... I don't want to be one of them.  
  
Any thoughts? How do you deal with feeling overwhelmed? How do you be assertive and let the techs know what you expect them to do? I feel like I sort of dropped the ball today and would love any constructive input. Cheers.",28,16,2014-06-20,PHARMA,0.12497708201408386,0.8409976363182068,0.03402528539299965

PRO: I love the science. I took parisitology in undergrad and loved it. I've loved all the micro I'e taken in med school. I like immunology. I could happily spend hours a day reading about the subject.

PRO: The diagnostic aspect and the multi-systemic nature of infectious diseases. I feel like this would be intellectually stimulating. 

PRO: Working with underserved populations. I speak French and Spanish, and I feel like this is a field were I might be able to use these abilities to communicate with populations that are both most at risk of infectious disease and also most in need of medical care. Also, HIV/AIDS work provides a chance to help people who are routinely discriminated against.  Also would be super useful to do MSF of volunteer in any international capacity (I'm Amurican by the way)

PRO: ID docs have a comparatively high rate of people who are satisfied with their jobs and would chose medicine again.

CONS: Well, its two extra years of training and then you make less than a general internist...which is obviously bovine manure but c'est la vie. Honestly though, I've lived out of a motel next to a trailer park eating peanut butter out of a jar for nutrition, so ""only making"" a hundred and fifty grand a year doesn't seem like a travesty, even though I am massively in debt. I figured I would just consolidate loans when I graduate, do IBR, work for a nonprofit, and have the govt forgive my debt after 10 years. Also, when push comes to shove, lifestyle and respect are way more important to me. I want to be able to have weekends, enjoy hobbies and travel. Also it seems the ID docs are well respected for their breadth of knowledge and ability to help out in hard to treat cases. (To be clear, I don't need constant validation from others, I just want to take pride in my work and be useful to those around me)

I couldn't find any ID specialty threads on reddit, so here is the the sort of info I think would be helpful. 

What do you do on a day to day basis?

As you see it, what are the pros and cons of your job? What do you find fulfilling, what aspects do you hate?

What traits are good traits to have in this field?

How is the lifestyle?

What educational experiences would you recommend to someone interested in this field? (What elective rotations would you recommend other than ID? any great books to read? anything one should be doing for the last few years of med school?)

pharmacy,"Help! Illinois medicaid denying lost medication for HIV patient, how to proceed?","One of my HIV patients lost their month of meds which amounts to around 2-3k worth of meds. I called Illinois medicaid up for a lost medication override, the pharmacist there refused to do the override since I was not descriptive enough with how the patient lost their medication. The patient doesn't know where or how it was lost, but they can't find it. I really don't understand how that logic works anyway, if they lost their medication, how can we describe where and how they lost it? Wouldn't they find it if they knew where and how? To complicate matters further patient is losing their memory, has very limited social help, has no money, has limited education, is not coherent half the time, and has been infected 30+ years. I got in a heated argument with the pharmacist; she said i was  bad pharmacist for wasting tax payers money, I said she was a bad pharmacist for denying a lost override for an HIV patient, who will surely be hurt without a month of anti virals. She also said all patients are solely responsible for their health, which you would have to be insanely heartless and ignorant to say. 

Be aware our pharmacy has only done one other lost override in the past 7 months for a 10 dollar medication. Should i just chalk this one up to another one lost to apathetic humanity? Or is there a way to help this patient, I have already spent so much time and resources on the patient that is not cost effective for pharmacy, but I feel there is a moral obligation but at this point I am about to give up, I can only do so much and am at a loss at what to do now.",27,16,2014-06-23,PHARMA,0.365522563457489,0.6082395911216736,0.026237867772579193

medicine,Advice for new interns on night float,"Hey guys, I started my intern year a bit early and I've been on trauma-acute care-general surgery-vascular night night float for the past two weeks now.  I just wanted to share some things that I've learned in that time for other new interns starting on night float.  I am by no means an expert so if I say something wrong here feel free to chew me out (everyone else is doing it).

1. If your hospital uses Epic, create some smart phrases for common ""scary"" calls.  So far I've made ones for chest pain, SOB, a fib w/ RVR, fever, low urine output, and tachycardia.  These are at least a few of the more common calls I've gotten so far.  These smart phrases remind me of what questions to ask, what labs to get, what to look for on exam and what a good starting differential is.  They also help me keep an organized presentation for when I call my junior resident. Which brings me to point #2

2. It seems obvious to stay calm, organized and have a plan when you call your junior resident about one of the above issues but it's easier said than done (at least at this point intern year).  I know I have a tendency to call immediately when something bad is happening and say, ""Ohmygod, Peterson vitals bad, chest pain, HAALP"" And then they calmly ask me for everything that I should have presenting first anyway. In these situations it's helpful for me to treat it like a trauma.  Run the ABCs.  If they're talking, breathing and have peripheral pulses you have enough time to collect your thoughts before calling your junior and/or staff.  

3. Sign-outs.  I actually still haven't figured this one out yet and any advice for me would be appreciated.  I can count the number of times on one finger that information signed out to me about ""do this if this happens,"" actually came in handy.  So far the best practices I've come up with is A) If you are signed out to follow up on something, immediately ask, ""what you want me do to with it?""  B) Ask if there's anything specifically you should NOT do with patients.  For example, if this patient calls with pain is it okay to give IV narcotics?  Perhaps in the medicine world this isn't as painful because medicine notes tend to be more verbose and helpful when you need to look up what's going on with a patient. In the surgery world the progress notes seem basically useless.

Anyways, these are just a few things that have helped me out so far.  Feel free to add your own or throw in your two cents about my tips!",56,72,2014-06-26,PHARMA,0.10733076184988022,0.8701496124267578,0.02251962386071682

medicine,Emergency eye clinic puzzle.,"We had a young patient attend our emergency eye clinic today for a routine follow up with us due to a recent episode of Hyphema. He was a 7 year old boy who got hit in the eye with a football (I believe) and was just attending to ensure his treatment was going well and there were no complications. 

But that isn't what's interesting, he attended clinic with his mother who was really anxious upon arrival. First thing in the morning her vision had suddenly deteriorated in her left eye.

In the eye clinic the nurses see the patient first. The nurse came to us and said ""I have the boys mother here; she has said that since she woke up this morning she has had visual loss in her left eye.""

She came in to our clinic room (with myself (the medical student) and the SHO) and sat down. 
She was a 32year old black woman. 

We asked her to explain her story and she said (I've translated to less broken English as her mother tongue was French)

""I woke up this morning at 6am and had my shower. I then got my son up, and ready for school. I went into my bedroom and got dressed for work and put my make-up on. I then went downstairs to leave and looked in the mirror. I couldn't see my face very well, I knew it was me, but it didn't look quite right. I thought nothing of it, and took Timmy to school. My phone started ringing and I looked at the phone and I couldn't read the name on the screen. I figured the visual loss was something I could get sorted here later in the day when we came for my son so I just brushed it off.

We tested the woman's visual acuity and it was 6/60 in her left eye. She couldn't distinguish any shapes and she could only distinguish changes in light levels. The right eye wasn't affected at all and was 6/20.

Upon testing with a pinhole the visual acuity in both eyes improved to 6/6. She normally wears glasses for hypermetropia. Left pupil was unresponsive to light. 
She is not diabetic, she does not smoke, has had no jaw claudication/facial sensitivity. She does not have hypertension. 

She has sickle cell trait, as does her son. 

We sent her home without follow up. We said if it didn't resolve in 48 hours to get herself checked out further.

.

We eventually worked out what was going on, but I put it to you, what happened? What is the diagnosis and what treatment should be offered? 
If you have any questions I might have missed out please ask and I'll try and answer (I'm still a 3rd year medical student so my knowledge probably isn't sufficient to know without you asking)

Edit: if somebody gets this I'll probably give them gold, I'm feeling generous. I've given everything needed to work it out, but it's tough.


Yeah, people got this in the end. She had woken up and showered, gotten her young son ready for school, including putting his Atropine eye drops in his eye. She'd then go straight to her room to dress and put on make-up, including mascara and eye liner. This acted as the vector, she carried the atropine on her fingers and put it into her eyes. The ciliary muscles and the sphincter pupillae relaxed due to atropine being a competitive antagonist at the muscarinic receptors.

pharmacy,Medicare Opt-in/Opt-out in 2015,"Apparently in 2015, as a dentist, I will need to register with Medicare either as a provider or as a non-provider (opt-in or opt-out  believe it was phrased).  As Medicare covers very little of what dentistry does, it's tough to justify opting-in.  But, if I read my information correctly, if I do not register one way or another, when I prescribe meds for patients with Medicare, they will not be paid for.  Meaning, the patient will have to pay out of pocket.  Some dentists have an ambivalent attitude towards this.  Granted 90% of what I prescribe is either antibiotics or analgesics.   I'm wondering how much of a PITA this will be for you guys having to deal with this for patients who expect meds to be covered.",28,12,2014-06-30,PHARMA,0.0337698720395565,0.9125151038169861,0.053715046495199203
