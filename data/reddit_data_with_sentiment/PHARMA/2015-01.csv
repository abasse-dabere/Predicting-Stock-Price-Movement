pharmacy,Bioavilability,"Assess with explanation the bioavailability by oral route of the following drugs with the specified properties. 

Also suggest ways to achieve the therapeutic concentration if the bioavailability is not favorable. 

(Note: change of route of administration should be considered as the last option of resolution) 

i. Drug A will be hydrolyzed to 30% of its therapeutic dose in an acidic medium within an hour. 

ii. Drug B has a hepatic extraction ratio of 50%. 

iii. Drug C is a biopharmaceutical of protein nature. 

i i think acidic medium =stomach, so drug interaction can be applied in this case?using some drug to alter the motility rate of gastric emptying? 

ii I think the drug is OK because extraction ratio is not too high,but I have no idea to explain in detail 

iii it must change the rote of administration because the drug will be digested by gastric acid.

pharmacy,Question about Brand name and Generic Drugs.,"I recently started taking a new medication.  My doctor did not want them to substitute for generic.  The medication worked but not as well as he had wanted.  He wrote me another prescription for a double dose.

After fighting with my insurance company for 6 weeks they finally reluctantly approved paying for it.  He is prescribing it for a reason, but my insurance company doesn'y either believe in his diagnosis (cause yeah, they're Doctors too) or they think the high dosage is too much.

Anyways, they agree to pay and I transfer my prescription from a brick and morter pharmacy to a mail order pharmacy.  This way I would spend $70 every three months instead of $70 a month.  

I get my new prescription from the mail order with the increased dosage and I'm confused.  It says on the bottle that it's the generic.  Ok, not good.  Then I look at my bill and its $20.  That's what I am charged for 3 months of generic medication.

But, then I open the bottle and they look exactly like the brand name ones I was taking before.  Same colors, shape, markings.  Every drug identifier online has told me its the brand name drug they sent me.  Did the mail order just mess up with labeling and cost? 

I basically just want to make sure I am not taking the generic one.  The pharmacy is closed today, so I thought I'd give here a try.",39.0,4,2015-01-04,PHARMA,0.02582005225121975,0.9300681352615356,0.04411185160279274

Patient 5: Diagnosis?

Patient 6: The CXR isn't the most interesting imaging for this guy - I can't upload his echo - but he was asystolic for several months with a motionless heart!

Patient 7: Five stars if you get this one, ten stars if you can explain how it happened.

pharmacy,Industry: HEOR vs Clinical/Pharmacometrics?,"Hi all,

I'm in need of some life advice right about now.  I'm a P3 student who has, up until this point, focused my career on health economic outcomes research.  I have a paper that will be published (2nd author) in the next month or so, and a summer internship lined up at a pharma consulting firm.  The paper will probably lead to presentation at ISPOR or AMCP.  So far, I think I'm on the right track.

Recently though, I've been trying to use my computer programming skills and I've found pharmacometrics as a wonderful niche where my programming has been very useful in model development (SciPy/R/NONMEM/etc).  My school offers a MS in Pharmacometrics and the graduates seem to love their job and make excellent money.

My concern is this: if I do the MS degree it's going to add on an extra semester to my schooling.  But if I go the HEOR route, I can get a job right out of school (admittedly, I'll probably have to go back for a second degree sometime later in the future).  I really enjoy both, so I don't think job satisfaction will be a factor.

pharmacy,Pharmacy Tech here with a weird question...,"I hope this is the right area to ask this, let me know if it isn't.  I'm a pharm tech working for a big mail order company in the midwest (won't name names but there's only so many).

My question regards actually verbally taking prescriptions over the phone.  One of the job aspects is taking a script over the phone from the doctor/NP, etc: It is limited to taking a Brand to Generic (Lipitor to simvastatin and so forth), but the pharmacy tech actually enters the rx into the computer, and it becomes a new script.  

My question is this: is this legal?  Does it skirt the laws?  I know sometimes we techs enter in wrong info concerning daily doses, refills, etc, and that can cause major problems--the supervisors write people up for that (and rightfully so), but is the very fact of a pharm tech inputting these rx's breaking the law?  I do it because my job requires it, and you certainly get in some trouble if you refuse, but I feel very wary of this, I'm not trained for it and I think it's only a matter of time before someone's prescription gets really messed up in a dangerous way.

pharmacy,Any experience with the PharmD/MPH dual degree?,"There wasn't a lot to be found about dual degrees (and in particular the MPH degree) on this sub. (And forget Googling because all it did was provide me with pages of colorful results straight from pharmacy school websites.) So I thought I'd ask to see if anyone has either pursued this path or knows someone who has. In what sorts of positions would it be beneficial to have? How has it helped in practice? 

My mental cost/benefit analysis: 

Pros: the cost is lower than if I were to pursue the MPH on its own, I'd graduate in the same amount of time, I'd potentially be more attractive to employers, I'd have experience in population mapping and perhaps figuring out which areas are most in need of which clinical services from a pharmacy? I'm still fuzzy on the pros, obviously. 

Cons: would cost around $15k more. I am fortunate in that generous scholarships, two decently-paying jobs, and supportive parents will allow me to cover the basic 4 yr PharmD+living expenses, but the 15k I'd probably have to borrow on my own. Also, the opportunity cost of ""losing"" summers, since having to take MPH classes would make it very difficult for me to get summer internships for P2 and P3 years that I had my eye set on.

I guess the main issue for me is that, as a P1, I don't know exactly what I want to do out of pharmacy school yet, but if it ends up being something where the MPH would be useful, I wouldn't want to miss this opportunity. On the other hand, I don't want to waste my time and money on a degree I'll never use. Some real-world examples of how this dual degree can be put to use would probably help a lot in my decision! :)",10.0,7,2015-01-12,PHARMA,0.052930522710084915,0.8982301354408264,0.04883936047554016

medicine,Public perception of comas and critical care medicine,"Partly provoked by this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2s2nac/redditors_who_have_been_in_coma_for_a_long_time_1/) 

""Comas"" are probably the best example of it I can think of, but it also extends to a lot of primarily intensive care medicine and a very skewed public perception that doctors generally don't seem to make much effort to debunk.

I've spent a fair chunk of my professional life in cardiac and general ICUs, and while the effort is always made to explain what's happening to the patient, it doesn't seem to do much to correct pre-existing perceptions of care. 

A lot is obviously coloured by media (fictional and non-fictional). It took me a while to realise that calling someone in a ""stable but critical condition"" wasn't an expert clinical judgement but rather a commentary on their current bed-card.

I would love to hear an anaesthetist explain ""your hernia was so severe that you were in a coma for the duration of the surgery"". Or the cardiac surgeon explain ""you were dead for 82 minutes during that surgery, but then we warmed you and shocked you back to life."" 

People (patients and their families) seem to wear it as a badge of honour; it seems to indicate a level of severity that justifies their suffering and gives them pride to have survived it. It provides a level of sensationalism to their medical care more than the routine. 

It also seems like an easier way of communicating the complex web of disclosure and quasi-consent in critical care medicine: it's a lot easier for a patient family to think ""he was in a coma for days after those pills and doctors weren't sure if he'd make it"" and be thankful/proud that they survived rather than to hear ""he was way too aggreesive and behaviourally difficult to monitor. We over-did the sedation, had to intubate him and then had to send him to ICU because it was going to take over four hours, then he became a little bit hypotensive from the propafol so we put in a line for some vasopressors but he got really agitated so we had to bomb him out, then he was very slow to wake off sedation so we ended up scanning his head just in case"". 

So what does everyone think about the public perception of comas/life-support and related non-medical terms? Do you think more effort should be made to educate patients? Do you think the misperception is dangerous or dishonest? Do you think it's any better or worse than other fields of medicine?",18.0,45,2015-01-12,PHARMA,0.0736168771982193,0.9020437598228455,0.02433936297893524

medicine,"Kind of far from Pre-Med, but need advice.","I am currently in the military (Army Medic) and I am extremely interested in going to school to apply to med school in the future. I get out next year and I am starting to plan my out of military future. Here is where I need advice.

I didn't do too well in highschool. I was aimless, and sure I was never going to make it into college so I was like ""Eh.. F'it"" and my grades showed it. But I joined the military and fell in love with medicine. I have been a medic for over 6 years, and by time I get out I will be at 7.5 years. Providers I have worked with have all encouraged me to pursue schooling to become a provider, and it is my goal to get there. What I am worried about though is 1) I have been out of school for 6 years, but I have been learning since then, mostly medical research, and such though. 2) Seeing as I didn't do amazing in school (in fact though I made it through to my senior year, I got dismissed during summer school of my senior year and got my GED [with high honors] before joining the Army), how will that affect me when I go to apply to a medical school?

This is something to I want to pursue more than anything. I love medicine, I love working with patients. I love treating and going over diagnosis, explaining what certain procedures have to be done to reach our goal, and so on.

Longtime Medditor here (this is a throwaway for some degree of anonymity for my main account). For the last few months, I've been working on a short podcast called Bedside Rounds, focused on interesting narrative stories in medicine, a la Radiolab and 99 Percent Invisible. I'm a resident, so my time is quite limited but I've slowly been learning audio editing (just yesterday got a real mic, so the sound quality will be dramatically higher). I've done episodes recently on the Nocebo effect, the medicine of Star Wars, and using the physical exam to solve the death of a Roman Emperor (among others). I'd love some feedback!

I think it was called traching or something?). Another example being using gunpowder to cauterize a wound closed (or any other combustible material).

EDIT: just some background on my doctor character. He's a genius, and retains Doctorates in biomedical engineering, molecular biology, and organic chemistry. His career in this post-apocalyptic setting is a cybernetic engineer. A nuanced version of the cyborg-implanting mad scientist popular in lots of science fiction.

pharmacy,Mannitol for celiac patients: anyone have any solid info?,"We just had a new patient come in requesting Lannett brand levothyroxine, because an Internet database of gluten-free drugs said that it was the only brand (which we can obtain) that the manufacturer would verify is gluten free. We ordered it for her, but it got me curious.

As far as I can tell, the only reason our usual Mylan brand didn't make the list is because of the inclusion of mannitol as an excipient. Apparently manufacturers tend to play it safe and say their products may include gluten if they have mannitol in them, due to the industrial sources or extraction processes or something.

Now, here's my question. I'd imagine that mannitol being extracted for a pharmaceutical product would be pretty pure and not actually be contaminated with gluten. Does anyone have any good source pointing one way or the other on this issue? It's nice to have a list of gluten-free meds, but I'd like to know enough to make decisions for myself as well and if everything with mannitol is left off the list that's a lot of meds I might potentially tell people they shouldn't use.",4.0,6,2015-01-15,PHARMA,0.035188332200050354,0.9374396204948425,0.02737201191484928
medicine,Malpractice insurance for volunteer medical care,"This is a hypothetical question regarding retirement and volunteer medical care.

Say that a doctor is financially independent and no longer has a need to work for income.  If this person wanted to give back to their community and volunteer to provide free medical care, how would they carry malpractice insurance?  Are there exemptions for providing free care?

My best guess is that you'd need to pay for an individual policy and you would not get a break on pricing, even if you only worked 1-2 days a week.  I can't imagine practicing bare, because a single suit could bring down your whole financial house of cards.  

I imagine that MOC would also be a thorny problem.  Do you need to be board-cert'ed if you aren't even charging for care?

Of course, I am nowhere near financial independence, but I anticipate that one day I will be there and I will want to continue practicing medicine for its own reward.  Part of this process is planning for eventual expenses, which is why I am asking these questions.  Maybe it would make more sense just to say eff-it and volunteer in another field.

I feel sometimes that we are not able to be as efficient as we should be considering we are all brand new! And I fear for mistakes...we are all still training, no one has their license, and it is extremely overwhelming at times. I try to learn things as quickly as possible but I feel as though people do not understand how much we are doing. I am not complaining, I just want people to understand that pharmacy technicians and pharmacists are working extremely hard to give you the best service possible and to fill your prescriptions as quickly as possible. There us a lot more to do than you may think. In addition, when it is just one technician and one pharmacist, it is very difficult to work at Production, Drive-Thru, Pick-up, Drop Off, and do a million other things.

I feel like I'm terrible at feeling these situations out and since I work retail, the structure for talking to my direct supervisor and contributing to the company is very different from my friends who work in more office-like jobs. Right now I want to ask to be transferred out of my store to a specific store that has an opening but I'm not sure what the right way to go about it is. My current store has a very toxic environment but insofar I feel like things I have done to remain positive and keep morale up are ultimately futile. I would like to try and address these more openly but it just feels like I'm inevitably going to be either vilified or seen as an annoyance. As such, bailing feels like my only option to keep myself sane. 

Basically, I'm just asking for advice on 1) giving negative feedback to colleagues and up the chain of command and 2) etiquette on asking for transfers in retail pharmacy.

pharmacy,(TW:Dumb question) Do you feel like you are well off or just making it by?,"Hey, I'm a fresh pharm student and was chatting it up with my buddy who is in med school for neuro surgery. Small talk ended up with me mentioning I wanted to buy a small fishing boat when I was finished with school and he laughed it off saying that 100k really isn't as much as I was expecting. 

""*Don't expect to be driving a BMW, 100k isn't much better than upper middle class really*""

I know this is a dumb question, and probably better suited to a sub about financial stuff, but I'm really curious if a 100k salary isn't as much as I've always pictured growing up. I'm not having children and don't plan on having anything lavish, but low six figures still feels like I'd be really well off. I never expected to be rich; but a nice house, a decent car, and a fishing boat are something I've pictured possible on 100k salary.

medicine,Looking for some help with understanding two kidney goldblatt hypertension,"I just finished up a PBL case where the patient was eventually diagnosed with two kidney goldblatt hypertension. There are just a few things that are a bit confusing.


For some back story of the case the patient was on a  thiazide diruetic and a beta blocker for 10 years controlling his hypertension. 

Two weeks ago he went to his gp with a cold and was found to have a bp of 190/100. He was then given captopril and nefidipine. He stopped the nifedipine after two days but kept taking the captopril.

Two weeks later his bp is 220/125.

Various tests came back as normal and eventually an ultrasound found the stenosed renal artery.

My first question was about his chem 7. Everything was normal except for a slightly elevated glucose and creatinine. Shouldn't his potassium have been low from the excess aldosterone?

My other question is why the ace inhibitor didn't prevent excess angiotensin 2 from being formed. I think maybe it could have been too low of a dose.

I'm expecting the solutions for both of these to be simple but I really haven't been able to find the answer on my own. Thanks!",3.0,5,2015-01-24,PHARMA,0.03494029864668846,0.9064239859580994,0.058635737746953964

I see a ton of geriatric patients at my retail pharmacy who take a lot of these older medications with the high sedation side effects just because they're cheaper.

Things like:
Hydroxyzine/Promethazine
Doxazosin/Prazosin instead of Tamsulosin
Clonidine vs something else like ACE inhibitors for BP control
Amiodarone/Fleicanide vs rate control drugs for Afib
Digoxin
Ambien
TCA's for depression rather than SSRIs
Phenytoin for seizures

medicine,"Practicing Doctors, what level of supervision/collaboration should NPs have?","States vary heavily on their legal requirements for NPs. I'd love to hear from practicing MD/DOs what they envision as the best system. No offense to med students, but until you're working it's very tough to estimate what's practical in terms of supervision. Some regulations that exist across the country:

* Requirement that they must be able to reach a MD/DO if needed.
* Requirement that a MD/DO reviews a percentage of charts each month. (percentage varies by state)
* Requirement that a MD/DO is physically at the address of practice for a percentage of time (percentage varies by state)
* Requirement that a MD/DO cosigns each chart that is done.

I understand MD/DOs on this sub largely do not like NP autonomy, so instead of simply railing against autonomy, I'd like to hear the opinion of practicing physicians as what they feel is the best way to work with this type of mid-level provider as a supervisor/collaborative physician.",170.0,62,2015-01-25,PHARMA,0.03849339112639427,0.9299163222312927,0.03159026801586151

medicine,ACEP posts updated TPA Clinical Policy for comments,"Anyone who is involved with the ""business"" side of ACEP or even follows some of the ""names"" in EM is well aware of the controversy surrounding the ACEP Clinical Policy on TPA.

ACEP released a new draft policy, [which can be downloaded here](http://www.acep.org/Clinical-Policy-Comment-form-Intravenous-tPA/), for comments. The [old policy is here](http://www.acep.org/Clinical---Practice-Management/Clinical-Policy--Use-of-Intravenous-tPA-for-the-Management-of-Acute-Ischemic-Stroke-in-the-Emergency-Department/). For those not familiar with this controversy, [Why we can't trust Clinical Guidelines](http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f3830), an editorial in BMJ, describes some of the issues.

Highlights, as far as I can tell:

1) Administration of TPA for acute stroke is now a Level B recommendation. This is a downgrade from the previous Policy from level A

2) The risk of ICH goes from 1% to 7% with TPA and must be taken into account when deciding on TPA with Level A support. This is totally new.

3) There should be shared decision making between Patient and physician for if the patient should receive TPA. Level C and totally new.

4) The level B recommendation regarding TPA between 3-4.5 hours is unchanged.

5) While the recommendations don't reflect it, there is a substantial section talking about harms and mortality. The policy makes it quite clear the TPA doesn't increase mortality.

**Edited in:** I think it is important for clarification that the Level A, B, C are an evaluation of the strength of the evidence. **ACEP is still recommending that EPs give TPA**. ACEP just can't give the highest level of recommendation anymore. 

This is both huge and not, as far as I am concerned. It does acknowledge the TPA nay-sayers while knocking down those who really overblow the TPA benefits. It acknowledges that TPA isn't an awesome miracle drug. It also gives the ED an ""out"" for the lower stroke scale patients where the numbers look good, but the risk of bleeding is potentially devastating, compared the living with some mild deficits. The new draft policy also implicitly admits that the policy making process for the old policy probably wasn't clean.

At the same time, it still recommends giving TPA and for most patients with a Stoke Scale of around 14ish, the numbers will still fall towards giving TPA. I don't think this will make a big change in how most strokes of less than 3 hours are going to be handled. With the focus on mortality related issues, there might even be a harder push with less ""out"" for higher stroke scale patients. Plus, I'm not really sure how significant it is recommend giving TPA but with a lower level of evidential certainty. It gives more wiggle from to defend one's management, but the recommendation is still to give TPA.

One thing to consider is that this policy is slightly different than what the Neurologists recommend. I doubt that the Stroke Center Certification process is going be friendly to ED docs not giving TPA without robust reasoning. Hospital administration will not be friendly to this policy if it potentially risks the magic certification.

medicine,Are new grads really having a hard time securing a residency.,"I teach a few classes at my local pharmacy school and am also one of the heads of their admission's committee. Within the last 3 years i have noticed a disturbing trend of new medical school grads applying to pharmacy school as a alternative to a residency or just to fill time. This year we received a record 26 MD's applications while last year was only 10. Most tell us that medicine was not for them in their interview but we really know whats going on they did not match. We have had to implement a policy where we don't accept MD""s due to the last 2 dropped out after their first semester after matching on their 4th attempt. So whats going on and why is this happening",24.0,5,2015-01-29,PHARMA,0.044282011687755585,0.9052852988243103,0.050432708114385605

pharmacy,How proper documentation can screw you,"One thing the other pharmacist I work with always stresses is documentation, documentation, documentation. But proper and correct documentation can screw you. This is an actual case from Texas, names and personal info changed (even though this report is a matter of public record, it's kind of sketchy on reddit's personal information policy so I'm gonna play it safe).

&gt; On or about 2011 , a pharmacist, while acting as an employee (pharmacist-in-charge) of a pharmacy in Texas, failed to properly label a prescription dispensed to patient X.X. The prescription was written for ""Humulin R 500/ml vial 30 units U-500 three times a day with meals, give with U-100 insulin syringe."" After attempting to clarify the prescription with the prescribing nurse practitioner's collaborating physician, the pharmacist dispensed 40 ML Humulin R 500u/ml vial with directions to ""inject 150 units three times daily with meals (inject 30 units with U-100 syringe)."" Later the patient injected an unscheduled dose of 150 units of U-500 insulin, five times the amount that had been prescribed, and was hospitalized.

So the logic of the pharmacist makes sense but that documentation didn't properly translate to the patient. Patient is injecting 30 units of Humulin R 500 BUT that's 30 units as measured in a u-100 syringe. So technically, the patient is injecting 150 units of u-500 but those 150 units are measured out at 30 units in the u-100 syringe. Patient didn't understand that and it yielded a license reprimand.",14.0,8,2015-01-30,PHARMA,0.10228357464075089,0.8683242797851562,0.029392212629318237
