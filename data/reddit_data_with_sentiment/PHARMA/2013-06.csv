medicine,"I'm considering MD/PhD, and would appreciate your opinions on how medical school and the MD changed your perspective of what's doable or worth doing in research","First off, I know everyone's not MD/PhD!

I got that. I've always told myself that I wanted to do a PhD after undergrad, but now I'm starting to think more about the potential benefits that an MD could afford me. I'm not thinking (gasp) as of yet that I would want to do a residency, but there are many people in biomedical research I've seen that get an MD/PhD and then go into a post-doc.

So mainly, I'm interested in hearing your opinions on how the MD changed your opinions on what sorts of technologies can be valuable in healthcare, or how change can be implemented, or what sorts of research are worth doing.

Vague questions, much? Sure, but I appreciate responses.

medicine,My Primary Care Experience,"This is an interesting thread but one that seems to have few actual voices from practicing primary care doctors.  I wanted to add something about my experience to the discussion. 

I am a 43 yo general internist and have been in practice for 15 years in a large multispecialty group practice. I work and live in a metropolitan area with a population of half a million, with another million in the surrounding metro area.  

For the first 10 years of my career I worked on call to the ER a few nights a month and rounded in the hospital a week every 6-8 weeks in addition to running a clinic practice.  I gave this call schedule up voluntarily 5 years ago when I got married and we started to plan kids, as I found sleeping in my bed every night to be increasingly compelling.  Now my work is all clinic based.

My salary, plus bonuses, at this point is 240k, and I do not pay my own malpractice out of this (just taxes, which is enough).  I take every Wed afternoon off (and take a 10% pay cut to do so, this is reflected in my salary above already), but to be honest I spend half of that time catching up on work.  My typical work day is between 10-11 hours, and I do not take lunch.  I also work a few hours every weekend from home to keep caught up. 

Because I work in a large group practice, I do NO insurance paperwork.  Yes, you did read that correctly.  That does not mean I do not have all kinds of BS to put up with, just not that particularly irritating kind.  The BS I do put up with includes all sort of Dilbert-esque level large corporate nonsense, but none that has interfered with what I do inside the exam room. 

My visits with patients are typically 20 minutes.  I carry a panel of about 1900 patients, who vary from homeless people with drug habits to a serving congressman.  Over 85% of the patients I see daily are on my own panel, and many of them I have known for over 10 years.  
As this is a diverse area, I see people with a very wide variety of ethnic backgrounds (including recent Hmong, Russian, Nigerian, and Brittish expats) and use language line phone translation not infrequently during exams. 

In addition to visits, I spend about 2-3 hours a day managing lab results, replying to patient emails, establishing followup plans from hospitalizations, etc.  I also serve on our quality assurance committee (I highly suggest getting involved in this if you can; it is an education in and of itself). 

Since I work in a large group practice where there are no barriers to communication with specialists, I find that the medicine part of my job can be as complex as I want it to be.  I send patients out to see specialists when either I need their expertise or to do a procedure I do not perform.   Often times I collaborate with them via the phone or email,  often times in real time while the patient is in the exam room (video derm consults included here).   

I manage my own heart failure, CAD, asthma, COPD, etc.  I treat a lot of common ailments, but also spend a lot of time working up new complaints. Because my nurses are great, we can handle some things that might go to the ED otherwise (put fluid into the potentially septic patient while waiting on their lactic acid level, for example, or get same day cat scans done with stat labs on a RLQ abdominal pain). 

When word got out my wife was expecting, I received from my patients something like a dozen home made receiving blankets, including ones that (from watching my wife do similar projects) I know must have taken twenty or thirty hours of work to create.  Jokes, inquiries about my family's well being, and other small gifts are common occurrences (and things I greatly appreciate).  The vast majority of my patient interactions are pleasant or downright fun. 

Because I get up early every morning (well, I'm at work at 7:30, so that will not sound early to you poor slobs still in training, sorry!), I am home in time every night to eat dinner with my family, do bath time and story time with my daughter, and spend time with my wife before going to sleep.  If you do not have a family now, believe me, this will be VERY important to you later. 

My undergraduate degree was from an ivy-league school in molecular biology, and I finished in the top 1/3 of my graduating class in medical school.  I initially thought about going into gastroenterology (endoscopy is cool) but lost interest along the way, and did not like the idea of being a trainee for another two or three years after residency.  I have found in no way that my interactions with specialists have left me feeling like a second class citizen; many of them are not just my colleagues, but my patients as well!

Personally, I like my doctoring to be a 50/50 mix of biomedicine and personal interaction, which is why I think primary care works well for me as a career.  Of course I do see tons of colds, and also have repeated the information about colorectal cancer screening so many times it is a loop tape in my head now that I probably mutter in my sleep.  But last week in clinic I also had a new spontaneous pneumothorax (my diagnosis, pulmonary clinic put in the catheter), a new dx of nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain in a 42 yo (missed by the ER two days previously, due to her near complete lack of focal neurological findings despite her significant midline shift, a real tragedy for her family), and a follow up appointment with my gent with a thoracic stromal cell tumor (good news, surgeon felt likely to be nonaggressive, we await final immunohistology to find out).  And also saw the patient who has lost 80 lbs in two years without gastric bypass because she listened to me that she needed to get more exercise and stop eating so damn much.  :)

I have no idea how typical or not my personal experience is among primary care doctors nationwide.  Personally I am quite happy to be practicing as a general internist and have no regrets about my decision to not pursue a subspecialty.  

To the medical students and residents reading this forum - I wish you all the best of luck making this choice.  Finding out you picked the wrong specialty after the fact is a hard pill to swallow, but there are certainly worse mistakes you can make in life.  Go investigate your options on your own as vigorously as you can (including getting outside of the academic world) and do not take anyone's word over your own judgement on something this important.",71,401,2013-06-02,PHARMA,0.05917331390082836,0.9096701741218567,0.031156512908637524

medicine,Thinking about going back to school. Advice?,"Hi guys,

I'm not sure if this question gets asked a lot, but I'm considering going back to school to study medecine.  I've been very unhappy with what I do for a long time, and feel the need to make a change.  I wanted to be a doctor or psychiatrist in the past, and have a friend who has the same plan to go back, so it's really gotten me thinking.  However, there are always complications:

1) I'm 28, so a little older than most, but probably within reasonable parameters.

2) I will have to go to back to school for nearly all of the pre-med courses since my undergraduate majors (accounting and Chinese) were non-scientific.  There seem to be programs that will handle that, but it will add time.

3) My college GPA was only 3.5, from a good state school in the Big Ten.  I was a lazy partier at the beginning (hence not pursuing pre-med then) so my good grades were mostly in my later, more difficult classes.  A lot of medical schools have very high admissions standards.  Would I be able to get into a decent med school with that sort of grades and a work history in entrepreneurship?

4) Med School debt.  I already have about 40k in outstanding student debt, although it's all gov't loans.  If I entered med school at 29, I'd probably not have a high paying job until I'm closing on 40.  This would complicate having a family (no plans yet though) and/or being able to afford a house in a timely manner.  This part I think I can accept, assuming I get a good job in the end.

I've also heard that many Physician's Assistants and some nurses have a very high skill level and can do quite well financially also.  Would this choice offer any advantages to a slightly older student in my position over med school?

BTW I can't exercise too much because of the fissure, but I do walk for 30-60 mins daily. I usually go to bed around midnight, which may be too late, so I'll sleep earlier this week and see if it helps.

medicine,I'm thinking of a career in the Medical Radiation Sciences - good idea or not?,"Hello

right now I am contemplating a career change into the medical radiation sciences -such as radiation therapy or nuclear medicine, or radiological technology. Just so I'm clear I'm not talking about becoming an MD but a four-year standalone degree, like what the [Michener Institute](https://www.michener.ca/ft/radsci.php) has offered in Toronto (not sure if this is called a 'technologist' or 'therapist', sorry if I'm getting the terminology wrong).

I'm asking for feedback, if this is a good idea or not. Obviously I don't know what it's like actually doing one of these jobs. The science-y side of things interests me, and it's good to help people in your work. I'd like some feedback to know what it's like doing this kind of work and whether these days, these might be good career choices or not. 

Any comments on salary, too? I've seen surveys, but as I'm a health care n00b I'm wondering if this type of position is considered high or low salary, health-care wise. For those doing this type of work, does your salary rise rapidly over time, or is it fairly static? Is salary based on experience moreso than geographic location, or place of employment? Are you satisfied with the wage?

Or anything else you'd like to add...

Health,I am a medical oddity. Please help me find some answers.,"I'll try to make this as chronological as possible, haha. I am an eighteen year old girl living with what my immunologist has referred to as an ""uncharacterized immunodeficiency"". Basically, it is known that there is something wrong with me but I don't match perfectly the profile of any immune disease.

1997 (2yo) ~ Tested positive for strep for the first time. Tested positive for the next twelve years. Not a single negative test even though I was tested nearly every month.

1999 (4yo) ~ First ranula removed.

March 2003 (8yo) ~ First contracted appendicitis. Pediatrician dismissed it as a viral infection not once but twice.

June 2003 (8yo) ~ My appendix finally ruptured. Emergency surgery followed by a weeklong stay in the hospital.

September 2003 (8yo)  ~ Stopped showing all symptoms of strep except for the rash.

January 2006 (11yo) ~ Started twitching. Around this same time, my hips started popping. Soon after I began seeing a neurologist &amp; was prescribed a slew of medications.

March 2006 (12yo) ~ Stopped sleeping. At most, I got three hours in a given night. Never felt tired.

May 2009 (14yo) ~ Passed out for the first time. Experienced sleep paralysis for the first time.

May 2009 (14yo) ~ Started sleeping anywhere from 12-18 hours a day. Never felt awake.

November 2009 (14yo) ~ EEG confirmed Temporal Lobe Epileptogenesis. My Dad got laid off &amp; we were no longer able to see my neurologist. 

May 2010 (16yo) ~ One final appointment with my neurologist. He does not mention my test results to me.

Around this time things started happening really quickly. Online I discovered P.A.N.D.A.S. &amp; was encouraged to visit an immunologist. In preparation for this appointment I retrieved all of my previous medical records &amp; discovered many results that my neurologist had never mentioned. On multiple occasions he described a cervical dystonia that had never once been mentioned to me or my parents. He also never told us that he had been testing for strep the entire time &amp; that my ASO titers were astronomical every time. He prescribed antibiotics to me once when I was going to camp in 2007. He also failed to mention the conclusive epileptogenesis, telling me nothing other than my results had been ""slightly abnormal"".

In September of 2010 I started getting crippling, debilitating headaches.

Found a new neurologist in 2010. A follow up EEG showed no signs of Epilepsy. A polysomnography/MSLT proved inconclusive because I received chemical burns on both sides of my head due to the electrode ""glue"".

In December of 2010 I had a second ranula removed. It was not a recurrence of the first one.

Tested seropositive for Lyme Disease, Mycoplasma, &amp; Babesia in 2010. Started antibiotic treatment for these &amp; other minor bacterial infections in March of 2011. Chose to end treatment in February of 2012 despite still being positive for Lyme &amp; Babesia. The treatment was honestly worse than the disease.

Found an immunologist in the middle of treatment. Discovered that I had shed all of my vaccines &amp; tested insanely positive for Rubella &amp; HHV6. These were both cleared over the course of a few months. Contracted my first case of MRSA shortly after. Then discovered that despite my T/B cell counts being perfectly normal, my T cell function was less than half of what it should have been.

In June 2012 I was taken to the ER with a fever of 104. It was determined to be strep &amp; it was the first time that I have shown any symptoms in years.

In November 2012, I got kidney stones for the first time at 17 years old. The CT scan also showed pneumonia.

There are plenty of other things that I'm sure I'm forgetting to mention, but in short I am in constant pain &amp; constantly sick. I've had a plethora of infections &amp; incidents that were not quite significant enough to make this list.

My primary complaints are...

Unavoidable infections. With everything that everyone around me ever has &amp; so much more.

Joint/muscle pain that is suspected to stem from the Lyme.

Headaches that have no known cause.

Sleepiness that is suspected to stem from Narcolepsy (my Dad has it &amp; Stanford recently established a connection between Narcolepsy &amp; persistently high ASO titers) that remains unconfirmed because of how traumatic the first test was.

Basically... I know that there is something wrong with my immune system. But there are so many other weird, seemingly unrelated things wrong with me as well. We have tested for what seems like everything in the book &amp; come up entirely empty handed. I am about to start college &amp; I am tired of feeling this way.

Health,What is wrong with my water?,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this so let me know if there is a better subreddit to post this.

When I moved into my new rental a few months ago, I noticed that my skin dries out real badly, most noticeable on my face and around my nails. The skin becomes dry and brittle and starts flaking.

This only happens at this rental. I lived in this city before (just down the street) and I had no issues there. When I stay at my boyfriend's for the weekend, my skin starts clearing up. When I return home on Monday and take a shower, my skin starts drying out almost immediately after exiting the shower. I recently spent a month out of town, and my skin looked great! I returned home two days ago and one shower later, my skin is already starting to peel around the fingers, and today my face looks all flaky.

At first, I though I was unintentionally taking hotter and longer showers in the comfort of my home, so I made a point of timing them and even edge the temp towards the colder side. That doesn't help. I only use coconut oil no matter the location, so that doesn't change. My towels are washed regularly and I use the same detergent as all my other clothes. The bathroom looks pretty updated, no sign of mold, and I always have the vent on. I am starting to lean towards it being the actual water. Any ideas?

Health,I jump out of bed for no reason in the middle of the night. It freaks me out. Story inside.,"I do not know if this is the right subreddit for this, so excuse me if I'm posting this here when I shouldn't.


I'm in bed typing this right now, because I still can't sleep from the adrenaline rush I just had for no reason. This has happened before, but not as severe. I was lying in bed, drifting somewhere between sleeping and being awake. All of a sudden something scared the shit out of me while I was asleep (not something in my room, just something in a dream, I can't remember what) , and made me jump straight out of bed with my pillow in my hand (no idea why), almost smashing my face on the ground because of the clothes beside my bed (messy room), and had me running for the door in my room. All this happens while I'm not really conscious, but not really asleep either. I stopped at the door and apparently turned on the light switch, which I cant remember, and just stood there for a few minutes thinking ''What the fuck did I just do?'' My body is pumping adrenaline and I don't even know why. The last time this happened I can recall that while I was asleep,  I thought there were spiders in my bed, which made me jump out of bed and stand in my room. That's when I ''wake up'', and kind of feel embarassed because I just jumped out of bed for nothing. 


I have been sleepwalking as a child, but that stopped when I hit puberty. I'm an eighteen year old male, if that helps.


I have a few wounds on my arm from hitting the wall while jumping out of bed, and I'm concerned I might hurt myself or my SO with this weird shit. I was wondering if maybe anybody has experience with this and could enlighten me.

Thinking I sprained it, I took my shoe off, didn't really see anything, continued on in pain.  Iced my ankle, whatever.  Eventually a perfectly circular bruise formed, and wouldn't get better for like, 5 days.  Went to , doctor, she was weirded out by the circle bruise and wrote a prescription for Naproxen(a painkiller, it hurt to walk), a x-ray(I thought it was a stress fracture, I run a lot), and a blood test ""just in case"".  Found out today I had elevated...something, my mom didn't remember, and they were doing further testing, but they prescribed me Doxycycline Hyclate.  Gives me a horrible headache.

So, what should I expect?  When is my ankle(the pain/ache has traveled up to my knee) gonna be good enough to run on again?  And how the hell did I get this?

Health,I was misinformed about medical costs - what can I do?,"I recently had physical therapy for about 6 weeks.  I had gone to an office to see the orthopedist, he eventually got me an MRI (which they told me would cost $500 out of pocket).

He recommended PT for 6 weeks, 2x a week.  To be done at the same location, or I could go somewhere else.  I went to the PT there, because it was convenient, AND they told me it would be completely covered by my insurance.

Come to find out much later that it costing me about $90 a session.  So now my HSA has been destroyed and I still owe a few hundred dollars.

This kind of mistake is unacceptable, and I was not fully informed when choosing their department.  Do I have any recompense at this point?

medicine,Dying neonates,"I'm a doctor; I currently work at the blood bank. I have done research on the genetics of breast cancer. 

A recent article in the journal for Dutch doctors describes the current protocol for medical abstinence in neonates (premature or not) who will either die shortly or will live a life with extreme handicaps. At the time of this procedure, they have first been resuscitated and kept alive to evaluate their chances of living; and then after careful deliberation and with consent of the parents, the decision to stop treating them has been made. Please, do not think we in the Netherlands kill babies with just Down syndrome or learning disabilities, these really are the very very ill babies who stand no chance in hell to ever live or to ever live without suffering immensely.

It describes how these neonates will be taken off the ventilator and will be left to die, just suffocating. It describes how the doctor should prepare the parents for the gasping of the baby (due to low oxygen) and that this is normal. It describes the use of muscle relaxants in case: 1. the baby looks very unhappy 2. the movements of the baby make holding it by the parents too dangerous (I guess that they will drop the baby) 3. the parents can't stand to see their baby suffocate anymore. 

To my knowledge, these muscle relaxants will then cause the baby to stop breathing completely sooner, because its muscles can't function anymore. In short: you're just making sure the suffocation doesn't take that long.

I ask thee, fellow doctors: why do we not kill these kind of babies in a more merciful way? Why do we not put them in a deep deep coma and then give them muscle relaxants and then take them of the ventilator? 

The, to me idiotic, difference is that in the first case, you are only abstaining from using medical tools (the ventilator), while in the second you are actively ending the life of that baby a bit quicker by giving certain medication before taking the baby off the ventilator. But the end result is completely the same, but without minutes to hours of suffering by that baby. 

Don't tell me a baby can't suffer. I think these babies suffer more than the average animal being slaughtered.

I'm mad at this; and I want to write a letter to the magazine about this, but I don't know how. I'm just a nobody, aren't I? I heard that we, in the Netherlands, are more liberal towards euthanasia than other countries, so I wonder how neonates who are unable to survive are treated in other countries?",815,164,2013-06-18,PHARMA,0.08835412561893463,0.8888692855834961,0.02277654968202114

medicine,How to deal with unruly physicians?,"Hi guys, I'm going to be an M1 starting August and had a few questions.  During the past year, my gap year between undergrad and med school, I decided to work as an ophthalmic technician with a group of ophthalmologists in NYC.  Out of the five doctors in the practice, two of them were rude, but one was the most unpleasant person I have ever come across.  The things that I came across were very unprofessional and I wanted to know how I should deal with those types of people in my future career in medicine.

The head of the practice, I will call him Dr. R, would scream at his staff (technicians, fellows, research physicians, and front desk) all day, and to make matters worse, it would mostly be in front of patients.  Examples of things he would say would be, ""Are you learning disabled?!?"" to the technicians, he told me multiple times in front of patients ""You don't have the common sense to make it in medical school,""  he told the international fellow from Iraq, ""this isn't the streets of Baghdad and you should be more hygienic,"" (when a technician forgot to clean the slit lamp), and also told the international fellow ""You would be better off strapping a bomb to yourself and blowing yourself up"" in front of the patients.  We have several members of the staff that are not native speakers of English, and he often mocks their English in front of them when they make small errors.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, and I wish I had written down more of what he said during the time I was working there.  How would you guys deal with a person like this?",89,50,2013-06-20,PHARMA,0.1097010001540184,0.8624232411384583,0.027875758707523346

medicine,Any IRs in the house? I would really appreciate some insight (Rads too!).,"I will be starting med school at a pretty average state school this fall. As of now, I feel like IR is what I want to do. I enjoy some hard science (undergrad in physics) and also enjoy being creative. This characteristic, along with my desire to be involved in clinical procedures and the potential for IR to continue to grow and develop makes the field very exciting. 

I know there is the DIRECT pathway and then the clinically focused pathway, but it seems like no matter what I need to match into radiology first. All of these programs are interesting, but who knows where they will be in 4 years, so I'd rather focus this discussion on what I can do as a med student to make sure I have a residency spot waiting for me 4 years from now. 

As of now, I honestly don't have much of a plan except kill grades in school, kill step 1 and seek out radiologists (hopefully I can find an interested IR) at the university hospital to get involved in research with. I am a little apprehensive though since I was told not much rads research is being done. 

Should I be shooting for # of publications? Or go for broke on pursuing some research with good substance to it? Any advice on what to do over the summers besides research? Would summer research be enough? I've heard of some people getting involved in research since the beginning of MS1. Are there opportunities available for some sort of ""internship"" that could boost my application?

Health,Got a nuclear bone scan today. This is what happened.,"I was a bit nervous about getting it done so I thought I'd post a description of what happened in case anyone else out there is nervous about it and wants to know what happens. 

First thing's first: **Don't be worried about it, nothing that happens is scary.**

So I got there at 9:30am and went into a small room with the scanner and spoke to a doctor for about 5 mins. He asked a few questions about my symptoms and explained the procedure. Then he left and a nurse told me lie down on the scanner. [This is what the scanner looks like.](http://www.whatisnuclearmedicine.com/upload/SPECT%20scanner.jpg) 

The nurse injected me with the radioactive substance. It was just a small needle in my forearm, not a catheter, and it took 5 seconds. I was worried it would make me feel funny but I felt no strange effects at all. The scanner took some pictures for 10 mins then I was told to go away and come back 2.5 hours later for the full scan. I could eat and drink as normal during this time. 

When I came back I laid down on the scanner again and this time they took 2 scans, the first one took about 20 mins then a few minutes later the second one took about 15 mins. I had to lie still the whole time but it was comfortable enough and not claustrophobic at all. You're not inside a tunnel like an MRI machine. I could listen to my iPod during the scan, and I wore my own clothes not a hospital gown (just had to take off jewellery in the location they were going to scan, I could keep my nose ring in). I could pick up my results that afternoon.

Then that was it. Apparently I'll remain radioactive for 24 hours and I was told that I will emit low level radiation during this time and should stay away from pregnant women and small children. The radiation is a small dose and is not really harmful.

That's all. Hope this description is useful to anyone out there going to get a bone scan.

1) Small red bumps filled with clear liquid (pin head sized)
2) They ""pop"" after they form
3) Intense itching sensation
4) Primarily on feet, also on legs. Primarily attached to hair follicles. Had some on my hands, but they're almost always in crevaces such as between my fingers or in the wrinkles on my knuckles
5) No bites on my torso or arms, just rarely in the armpits and/or hands
6) The bites leave the skin discolored for a few weeks and stop itching after a few days
7) I'm 23, male
8) This has been recurring now for 2-3 months, but it's more intense currently than it has been
9) They stop itching after a few days, but they leave a discoloration on the skin.
10) They stop itching when sealed with either scotch tape (when I'm stuck at work) or clear nail polish. Heat tends to help too
11) I've moved since having them, and there was no change

Patients who argue with you over why they can't get their prescriptions.  As if there is some grand conspiracy against them by the pharmacist to deny them their medications.

You want the drugs, I sell you the drugs... and that is how the free market works.  Pretty fan-fucking-tastic.

SOOOOO... if for some reason you cannot get your prescription filled, there is usually a pretty damn good reason why.  There is some barrier between us preventing this transaction from occurring.  Something legal perhaps (I cannot authorize three months worth of refills without the doctor approving it).  Or perhaps there is something wrong with the insurance like a prior authorization (because Lord knows you are not going to pay the actual price of all your medications... so somebody has to and that somebody is your insurance company).

But Kaiser, unlike every other insurance company out there, doesn't tell anyone! 

A way to find out if Kaiser health plan covers proton therapy for prostate cancer is to obtain prostate cancer, get diagnosed, ask for proton beam therapy, and then get rejected. Only then is Kaiser forced to say ""this is what we think about PBT for prostates and this is the research we cite"".

So, does anyone on /r/medicine have access to these rejection letters? I'd be interested in any rejection letter and its citations but especially anything w/ radiation therapy. 

Please PM or comment if you have inside information on this shadowy corporation.

Btw, I don't mind managed healthcare overall but the information gap is terrible (and deadly).",9,21,2013-06-27,PHARMA,0.03769811615347862,0.9328691959381104,0.02943263202905655
