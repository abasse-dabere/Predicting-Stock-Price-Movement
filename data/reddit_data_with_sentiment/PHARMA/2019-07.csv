medicine,To all of the interns starting tomorrow...,"I know some of you have already started, but nationally July 1st is a big day for many in the U.S. Make sure you have a good support system in place, any survival handbooks available to you on hand, don't be afraid to state that you don't know the answer when you don't, and always be respectful to both patients and any staff you are working with. Don't forget to arrive on time with a nice caffeine boost and (even though you may be tempted to) don't get too detailed about any patient encounters you have on social media, in the halls, or even at computer stations if you are within listening ear of patients. Some of you will have your first 24 hour shift or night shifts this week. You might get tested by the nurses while you have the pager, but just make sure to take a quick look at how your patients are doing by laying a quick eye on them. Don't be afraid to look at Medscape, Epocrates, Uptodate, etc. Utilize them whenever you can! Don't get flustered when the EMR is more daunting than you first though of. Check with your attendings or seniors before placing orders and double check them and make sure they are on the correct patient. You have made it so far and tomorrow marks a new day in your journey.

medicine,GARDASIL-9 in patients having received GARDASIL,"I'd like to hear your perspectives about pretty controversial topic that has yet to be studied extensively.

With the emergence of the GARDASIL-9 vaccine, a lot of patients who have previously received GARDASIL ask about whether or not they should get the GARDASIL-9 vaccine as well.

The CDC claims that this should not be the case but I can't find the studies that they have based this statement on. Regardless, I feel like there can be lots of benefits if it is done, particularly if a patient isn't sexually active yet or has multiple sexual partners, (i.e. is not monogamous) or is immunocompromised.

I feel like there isn't information out there for those who are interested in getting extra coverage with GARDASIL-9, particularly in regards to how many extra doses should be given (should there be 2 or 3 doses?).

Opinion: PharmD Quality vs Quantity  
 

Peter Vlasses, PharmD  
 In my 20 years as executive director of the [Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE)](https://www.acpe.edu/),  and more so recently, we have been asked why we don’t call a moratorium  on opening new pharmacy schools, or why we don’t better control the  number of students enrolled and graduating from accredited programs each  year. Or, why isn’t ACPE acting as the “gatekeeper” for new schools and  pharmacists entering the marketplace to help manage and preserve jobs  and salaries in the industry?  
 We live in a free market society. When I started in my position,  pharmacy had 78 accredited schools, and we were graduating approximately  7,000 students a year. Because projections were made of an upcoming  pharmacist shortage due to an aging population with increasing  medication needs, existing colleges and schools of pharmacy expanded  their class sizes and/or opened branch campuses. Many new schools began  to apply for accreditation.  
 Now we have 143 accredited schools and are [graduating approximately 14,500 students per year](https://www.drugtopics.com/pharmacy/are-there-too-many-pharmacists).  Until recently, this dramatic increase in graduates has been  accommodated by the job market, with almost all students having  employment options, although lately, not always in their preferred  geographic area. As the urban job market started to saturate, enrollment  numbers to pharmacy programs have begun to take a downturn.  
 This is the type of market response I learned about years ago in  economics. Had ACPE acted to limit the growth of existing programs or  new ones, many of the new graduates would have been robbed of the  opportunity to practice pharmacy.  
 Educational program accreditors do not exist to control the employment  markets of their associated professions. ACPE’s standards are based on  quality, not quantity. Our focus is making sure students have the best  information to make career and program decisions at the time of  application.  
 Unfortunately, sometimes a market shifts quickly before a cohort of  students graduate from a four-year program. As ACPE monitors licensing  exam performance and the employment of graduates, it is important to  ensure students are properly informed about these market shifts. We have  noted that program sizes have begun to “right size” on their own by  accepting fewer students and ensuring acceptance of only qualified  candidates, and by closing branch campuses. These actions are the  responses seen in a free market system.  
 By monitoring enrollments, graduation and employment rates, and  information available to applicants and students, we as accreditors  allow the market to respond based on the availability of relevant  information. However, if a program continues to accept students when  their graduation, licensing, and employment rates fall, we can (and  have) engaged its leaders in serious conversations about their need to  better inform prospective students about these rates and/or adjust  program size. If the pharmacy program is unable to meet ACPE  accreditation standards, that is a different story that requires  different considerations.  
 I have great compassion for those pharmacy students who struggle to find  employment after graduation while trying to manage substantial student  loan debt. On the other hand, I believe there are jobs for pharmacists  in rural America for people willing to relocate, even for a few years  until the job market opens up and as more baby boomers retire.  
 Although I feel bad for those students facing job placement  difficulties, ACPE is unable to change its review process that would  either close programs or stop accrediting new programs as a means of  protecting them.",62,96,2019-07-01,PHARMA,0.06204446405172348,0.9066312313079834,0.03132430464029312

medicine,"A great interview with a Stanford med professor - ""Her Famous Student Didn’t Listen — and Is Paying a Big Price""","A fascinating interview with Phyllis I. Gardner, a Professor of Medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Teaching moral values is the most important thing indeed.

""Before Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford University to start the blood-testing company Theranos, she asked one of her professors for advice. That professor, Phyllis I. Gardner, told her that the science wasn’t there, that it wouldn’t work. Holmes didn’t listen, and the rest is history — headlines, really. In 2018, Holmes settled civil fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And this month a federal court will hear from Holmes and her former business partner, who [have been charged](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/health/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-fraud.html?searchResultPosition=1) with deceiving investors, patients, and doctors. Holmes has denied wrongdoing.

Gardner said it wasn’t going to work. Lots of people didn’t believe her. Now, one blockbuster *Wall Street Journal*[investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901) and a book, documentary, podcast, and federal lawsuit later, Gardner, a professor in the School of Medicine, was proved right.

As Holmes’s story unfolds, and onlookers, including universities, try to glean lessons from the bad blood, Gardner said they should emphasize to students the importance of developing values rather than chasing a billion-dollar idea. She spoke with *The Chronicle* about her role as an adviser and why it’s not enough for students to pay lip service to empathy, honesty, and the other virtues they should have learned along the way — they have to live them. ""

medicine,How do I explain the danger of false negatives in screening tests?,"Background: An older close relative of mine has repeatedly had fresh and clotted blood in his stool, so I've been urging him to go to the doctor. However, he doesn't like going to doctors in general and is concerned about the cost, so he wants to do a stool-based screening test first as he's been suggested those in the past. I think he believes that if it came back negative he would not need to go to the doctor. I tried explaining the concept of possible false negatives by saying that it only makes sense for people with no symptoms, but that he should go to the doctor anyways because he's seen the blood. He mentioned the stool test again today, so I feel like I need to try explaining it in a different way.

On a more general note, I am wondering how to explain the issue of possible false negatives in plain english? Is there maybe a simple analogy which will be readily understood by most people?",28,38,2019-07-01,PHARMA,0.04890250787138939,0.9162459969520569,0.03485140949487686

medicine,Cooking the books,"Over the years I’ve seen a lot of this. Health care organizations as a whole and administrators bending or breaking the rules of what’s ethical in order to meet some quality measure set by CMS, MDS, JCAHO, etc so they can get their gold star, five stars, approval, blah blah blah. 
Some of issues I’ve come across recently have been blood pressure targets that don’t take into account whatsoever the patient’s background: 

“We brought the patient back for a blood pressure check because their top number was high”

“They’re a medically fragile 91 year old who’s 2 points over her target with cognitive impairment, no home support, already taking 10 medications, and their diastolic is in the high 50’s we’re not doing any additional medication”

“Ya but it counts against your numbers and our quality measure.”

Another one is antipsychotic use in rehab facilities:

“I recommend a low dose antipsychotic since the patient has had good response to this one in the past.”

“We’d prefer it you didn’t prescribe antipsychotics since bipolar disorder isn’t an approved CMS/MDS diagnosis and it’ll count against us. Have you tried some other antidepressants.”

“I don’t think you understand bipolar disorder and we’ve tried a lot of other things already this is it for options.”

“We’d still prefer you don’t prescribe it.”

And recently I overhead talk of administrators passively suggesting to clinicians to just diagnosis them with schizophrenia so it doesn’t count against them. 

What it is this shit? It’s incredibly unethical and unsafe. Has anyone else experienced this? Who are we supposed to report it to when the very organizations putting forth these measure are the ones that are supposed to be safeguarding patients?

If any of you are interested, feel free to try it.","I'm a radiation oncologist, so I obviously get many questions about all aspects of cancer. I found that many patients were particularly concerned about the exact causes of their cancer and wondered whether the same causes could provoke the development of another cancer or could provoke a similar cancer for the people around them. So I decided to create an app to adress those concerns!

The aim of the application I have developed is estimating the risk of cancer for any individual based on all the risk factors that can be found in the scientific literature. It includes 250 different risk factors and can calculate the risk for 26 different cancers. This includes an entire section on different medications and another on supplements. It also gives you a breakdown of each of those risks by showing you all the risk factors influencing it (both positive and negative) with detailed figures, possible lifestyle changes one could make and references. It is completely free and does not transmit any medical or personal information to us or any other party.

To be clear, the app is **strictly educational** and all information contained within **cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician**. It is aimed at the general public, to clarify exactly what causes cancer and give some idea which risk factors have a larger or smaller impact.

The app is called 'Cancer Risk Calculator' and is available for both Android and Apple devices. If any of you would like to see the effects of a condition on the risk of cancer or would like to calculate your own risks, please feel free to try it.

medicine,Anyone ever go to patient’s funerals? Wanting to know if it’s acceptable,"I work in a NICU at a fairly large hospital and I had a premature baby come in at 23 weeks. And that baby stayed with us for 6 or 7 months and in that time I took him almost exclusively on the weekends. So I got very close to the family and the baby in that time. They were so nice. If I had time I would always stop and chat in between doing things. They played jokes on me, we laughed, we talked for hours, we would help them get him up to hold. God I loved that family and that baby and I really think they loved having me there. 

He was always a little bit of an under dog. He had a lot of health issues and his lungs were a big one. We tried alot of things with him. Some things worked and some didn’t. He ended up getting a trach and  at our hospital they usually will go to the PICU once they get one and that’s what happened. So he went down and I haven’t seen him or his family for probably a month or two. But he passed away this week in a kind of a freak way that I won’t elaborate on but it wasn’t expected. 

I’m having a hard time processing his passing as I really thought he was going to make it out. By the time he got his trach he would smile and play and started doing baby things and it was amazing seeing his progress. I’m deeply saddened by his passing and I’m not going to lie and say I haven’t cried. 

So what this post is really about is have any of you been to a patient’s funeral/viewing? I have talked to a few of the nurses and I get very mixed responses. Some say if you have that kind of connection with them then you should go and other say it’s best to let to go. I think it may help me but maybe it’s irrational but I have this fear that seeing me is going to make them relive their NICU experience. Am I being irrational?",80,422,2019-07-05,PHARMA,0.05747127905488014,0.8958632349967957,0.04666551575064659

pharmacy,I've been put on an Employee Performance Plan at CVS. Am I being pushed out the door?,"A little background. I started w/ CVS as a grad intern last May in a district an hour from my home. Busted my ass and did very well as a pharmacist and garnered praise from all my stores/DMs. I put in for a transfer to a district within my house radius and was approved and placed in a store immediately (to my surprise).

I thought this was going to be a great transition but the store has just been my own personal hell since starting here. THe store was previously ""the best in the district"" but had been on a slow decline since before I arrived. In the beginning I was very confused becuase the store does alot of practices i'm not familiar with and really wasn't doing well. I was so stressed I amassed a few customer complaints as well. After a conversation with my manager about a possible write up if things do improve I decided to change my interactions.

My interactions with customers has done a full 180 and I haven't gotten a complaint in over a month. I've steadily gotten better at clearing q's and managing my techs and i've personally felt a great improvement. I'd even ask my PIC every other split shift how I was doing and to keep me updated with feedback but she wouldn't offer anything specific and would state things are going well.

Well we had our end of July review and apparently we're the ""worst in the district in everything"". My PIC said she's write up a plan for the store so I thought we'd discuss it late. Well one day my DM walks in, pulls me out the pharmacy, and states I'm ""improving"" but not at the rate he wants and wants me on a EPP to ensure I get where he wants me to be. 

I read through the plan and it STILL has events from the first month where I was stressed and had a few bad interactions that havent occured in months. I'm just very frustrated and at a loss at this point.

TLDR: I was put on a EPP. What's going to happen? AM I being shoved out the door? What do I need to do to keep my job. Is this basically just the end of my career at this company and I should start looking for another job?",53,84,2019-07-07,PHARMA,0.059288930147886276,0.8797110915184021,0.061000049114227295

I seem to go through periods teetering on burnout where it seems like almost every patient is a Spanish speaking, dramatic patient who schedules for a single complaint or an annual and then unloads 40 minutes of what I feel to be psychosomatic complaints after what I feel is an objective assessment, or on the other hand, the ultra rich housewives who seem somewhat histrionic about their small symptoms that I feel are related to their anxiety and demand expensive and unnecessary tests (MRI for 1 day of toe pain) and insist their cousin/friend’s husband is a chiropractor and told them they needed this.

How do you all stay unjaded- any tips or suggestions on how to adjust my attitude and thinking?

EDIT: to be clear, I acknowledge that psychosomatic symptoms are real and deserve treatment and am willing and able to treat them.

pharmacy,Paying off your student loans quickly is probably a mistake.,"I wanted to make this post to explain why paying off your loans too quickly is most likely a mistake.  With the instability and lowered salaries that we’re seeing in the field having a payment option that adjusts to your income is very valuable.  If you’re not familiar with Pay as You Earn (PAYE) the terms of the program are pretty simple, you pay 10% of your discretionary income for 20 years and your student loans are forgiven.  As the program stands right now the forgiven amount will be taxed as income to the extent that your assets exceed your liabilities.  This is known as the tax bomb and I tend to think it will be fixed in the coming years.  One important point to remember is only federal loans are eligible for PAYE, so refinancing your loans with a private lender to save a few points on interest can be disastrous.  I put up a spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-fMlT7JXYsAllSEvchDvCzZZ8H7JpsSQVia07x94aMU/edit#gid=0) so you can put your own income and family situation in, but here is a common scenario:

*You start out making $120,000 and graduate with $200,000 in loans at a 6% interest rate.  Your income stays flat for 20 years, but you max out your 401k ($19,000) every year to lower your adjusted gross income (AGI) and reduce your PAYE payment.  If you try to pay off your loans in 5 years your monthly payment will be $3,867 and you will have paid $231,994.  If you go for 10 years your payment will be $2,220 and you will have paid $266,449.  On the other hand with PAYE your monthly payment will be $686 and you will have paid $40,750.  The last 3 columns are the cumulative payments for each plan.*

*Another scenario is you start out making $120,000 with $200,000 in loans again.  This time after 2 years you get laid off and can only find a job making $60,000 but receive raises every few years.  This time I lower 401k contributions to $6,000 to reflect your lowered income.  If you would've committed to paying your loans off in 5 years you would've put $92,000 towards your loans before getting laid off and would now be in a situation where that extra money would've been very useful.  If you would've committed to paying them off in 10 years the number would be $53,000.  With PAYE you would've put $19,000 towards your loans after two years and your monthly payment would flex down to a manageable $288 the next year.*

pharmacy,Pharmacists save lives,"As a Walgreens Pharmacy client, I am sadden to see how pharmacists are treated by both their employers and clients.  

A doctor “practicing” medicine nearly killed my two year old daughter by prescribing an incorrect medication.  That was 20 years ago, and many times since then a pharmacist has intervened and saved her and my life (I always discuss a medication now).

I am deeply indebted to your knowledge and commitment to protecting the health of people you may never meet.  Many people are unaware their doctors do not understand mechanisms of action, (or even the term).  

I cannot adequately express my gratitude.  last night a pharmacist consult confirmed my concerns with two medications for another daughter (complex medical diagnosis) the doctor refused to hear.  Her aorta will remain attached a little while longer than had I blindly trusted a doctor.

pharmacy,Why I continue to work retail,"This is a reflection of the last week:

Hours cut and my techs do 30 scripts per tech hour. I barely have any time to do anything except pick up the phone and ring people out. I had to wait 2 hours to use the bathroom the other day because my front store was busy giving their employees lunch breaks only to return to 4 patients angrily waiting for me. Havent had a bite to eat at work in a month. And a slough of other frustrations.

Highlights:

Two patients I've been working with for 2 years along with their doctors have told me they are now opioid free. That makes 5 patients this year! They have gotten the help from either dependence therapy or weaning off current opioids. Its shocking to see how much they've changed and how much they seem to ""glow."" 

Refused to dispense amiodarone for another patient discharged from the hospital, it was not supposed to be prescribed to this patient anyway (why is it always amiodarone accidentally prescribed for the wrong patient?). Patient was upset at first but thanked me once the nurse told him what that medication might have done. 

Lost 10 lbs and now overweight instead of obese per BMI scale. 

Back to work, can already see my drive through is backed up and can tell by the parked cars some patients are waiting to talk to me. Happy Monday everyone!

Thankfully, ya boy here has been a pharmacy tech for the last 5 years and has spent countless hours counting out drugs in a retail setting. Upon close inspection, the jelly beans in the jar appeared to be roughly the same size and shape as Metformin XR 500mg; the jar they were in was actually the same size as the 500ct stock bottle we carry them in, with maybe a 60 dram-worth added.

medicine,The Bactericidal vs Bacteriostatic myth,"So recently I was lectured by an internist regarding an antibiotic choice due to the antibiotic's bacteriostatic properties (clinda). He preferred an antibiotic that is bactericidal (vancomycin) along with Zosyn. We will ignore the fact that this was a patient stung by a wasp the day before, with a fairly large local inflammatory response to his arm that I've seen frequently in the ED. The patient was afebrile, normal VS, the was no induration, no tenderness, and this internist was requesting we admit him to monitor for possible necrotizing infection (eyeroll), but sure as long as you are the one doing the admitting.

I tried to explain to him that bactericidal and bacteriostatic are laboratory definitions and are clinically meaningless, but he was adamant regarding his antibiotic choices. I eventually relented, as he would be the one caring for the patient while he is admitted, but did advise that he read [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5905615/) article from *Clinical Infectious Diseases* regarding the myth of *-cidal vs -static* antibiotics. Its a systemic literature review which demonstrates 56 RCTs comparing -cidal vs -static antibiotics, of which 49 showed no significant difference, 6 which demonstrated superiority of the -static agent surprisingly, and only a single RCT that demonstrated superiority of the -cidal agent (although the -static antibiotic was underdosed). 

To be fair, I was taught this in medical school as well, and even in residency I had an intensivist try to explain this to me, although I had never actually seen any convincing literature on the subject. I posted this story and article primarily to address dogma that appears to still be present today, and the importance of doing literature reviews on widely held knowledge, as much of what we were taught in medical school and residency have very little evidence base.

I get quite a bit of these scripts a week in my area (I’m a floater) so I don’t bother calling the MD every time to make sure the patient got the injection first. I have tried before, MD just gets mad and tells me I’m wasting their time. So I just cap it for mandatory counseling, making sure they got the injection first, and tell them about the black box warning if they didn’t. Apparently pharmacists around my area are also clueless. They either don’t know about the black box warning about getting the IM injection first or they don’t care. I have spoken to a few about it and they shrug it off like it’s not a big deal

Anyways, I refused to let one go because when the guy came to pick up in drive, I did the usual cap to counsel and found out 1) he never got the injection 2) he is currently taking Eliquis for PE and clots in his leg 3) he gets his meds through mail order so his med history is blank 4) he had a history of stomach ulcers 5) he has active shingles so he went to urgent care and the DO wrote him acyclovir and ketorolac for pain

So the ketorolac was for shingles pain. Wtf! Did the ER doc not check his med history or anything before prescribing? What if I didn’t work yesterday and the staff pharmacist just filled the script without checking anything like they usually do. And the poor guy would have been taking it for 10 days, even though it’s supposed to be 5 days max usually. I’m just glad he understood why I didn’t let him go home with it. He said he will have to call his PCP for something to help with the pain

medicine,What’s the rules in general for trying to date another physician,"I am a big fan of doc marriages. I love what I do and love being able to share those stories with an understanding audience. I also find intelligence to be highly attractive. While it’s not a firm requirement, I would love to date another physician. 

I am starting as an attending in a teaching hospital / med school. My previous relationships with other docs were results of online dating as I had a personal policy of not wanting to connect with people in the same hospital.

Now I am in a smaller town, just wondering how does meddit handle this type of situation?

pharmacy,Transitioning from retail to hospital - ramblings from a hiring manager,"So I wanted to take a moment to talk about making that retail to hospital transition. This seems to be a constant source of discussion that occurs on this sub as people try to escape community pharmacy. Many of the posts do a terrible job actually explaining how people make that transition however. There's a lot of talk about having connections through networking, being persistent and applying to every job listing in existence, dropping $600 to get BCPS certified (lol), but nothing really about how to really sell yourself as somebody suitable for hospital work. 

The reason I wanted to write this post is because I was out having drinks with a pharmacist I had the opportunity to bring on board to an academic medical center 2 years ago. This guy was highly experienced with 6 years working in retail, staffing a pharmacy that did about 3500 scripts a week, and lots of experience with operations and managing a pharmacy team. He thought we hired him because we were desperate, and it blew his mind when he found out he beat out newly graduated residency trained pharmacists. He kind of made me promise to write up something that walks through how to approach getting a hospital job. So here we are...

First things first, if you're considering a position in a hospital with a background of your run of the mill community pharmacist, you're most likely going to fit best into a STAFF PHARMACIST position. This is because the job duties of a strictly staff pharmacist is very similar to a staff pharmacist in the retail setting. The background you have from pharmacy school has provided you with the clinical background required to staff, everything else (technology, operations, etc.) is stuff you'll pick up on the job. This isn't to say you can't slot into any of the other numerous positions available like clinical staff pharmacist, clinical specialist, sterile compounding, manager, director, informatics, drug info, med safety, etc., but with a retail pharmacist background, you can most strongly speak to the job requirements of a staff pharmacist, which is a great place to start. This leads to my second point, actually addressing the job duties and requirements with your resume/cover letter and interview.

I pulled a random staff pharmacist job posting from indeed.com and I'll go through and talk about how you can equate your retail experience to the job duties. I did this with my buddy and I think that was how I eventually convinced him he was the most qualified for the position since his previous job experience made him a much more seasoned candidate then new grads, even if they're residency trained. 

&gt;Perform Staff Pharmacist duties in the hospital pharmacy with an outpatient infusion center. Verification of medication orders, medication monitoring, inpatient medication reconciliation, discharge counseling, attending to codes, IV preparation, Pyxis management, ancillary staff oversight/support and various other projects pertaining to hospital pharmacy.

1. Verification of medication orders - verification between retail and hospital is essentially the same thing. The drug may be different but you're still checking the same factors, drug interactions, dose, route, adverse effects, and appropriateness. During the hiring process, we're looking for a pharmacist that is able to quickly evaluate meds for issues and then be able to communicate succinctly to the prescriber. With how simple most EHRs make ordering now a days, the vast majority of orders can be verified with a brief glance at the patient profile, and the tricky ones will require a little digging in Lexicomp like on the retail side. You'll probably have some standard personality questions to gauge your thought process when handling an issue, and how you communicate the issue to coworkers and prescribers. STAR and examples are your friends here. 

2. Medication monitoring - again, fundamentally there's no difference with the process between retail and hospital, it's just the drugs and disease states that are different. Brushing up on common health conditions you'll see in the hospital and basic PK/lab monitoring and being able to intelligently speak to it will make you more than qualified in this regard. What probably trips up most people here is the disconnect from pharmacy school where you were taught how to manually calculate PK doses for common drugs, most of the time, the correct answer will be to simply say you'll follow hospital policies/nomograms for dosing. 

3. Medication reconciliation and discharge counseling - This is exactly as it sounds. Hopefully as a pharmacist you're able to collect a medication history and reconcile it and be able to counsel patients on medications. You probably are better off than most pharmacists since you are also familiar with the insurance situation for the area so definitely talk about that as well. 

4. Attending codes - The hospital will provide ACLS training and hopefully you already have BLS from providing immunizations. The importance of this is also highly dependent on the staffing model. If you want to seem on top of it, ACLS materials are available online for you to brush up on.

5. IV preparation and Pyxis management - IV preparation is something you'll unlikely have exposure to in retail. However, unless the position requires you to actually be involved with hands on compounding, just seeming like you have a high attention to detail is generally enough as teaching a pharmacist to verify sterile compounds is a simple process. Again, USP 797 and 800 training material is online if you want to pick up some basics. Pyxis management, carousel usage, technology in general is something you will pick up on the job. If you happened to have a box picker or auto counter at your retail location, you can talk about vendor relations and technology usage to underscore you aren't a luddite. 

6. The rest - working with pharmacy technicians and buyers and administrative stuff. This is stuff you hopefully know how to do. 

So overall, I hope you can see that there are a lot of similarities between hospital and retail. Ensuring that your CV highlights pertinent aspects of your career to the listed job duties and how you have experience performing those job duties will place you in a competitive position. This isn't to say you're the most ideal candidate that we're looking for, but you're not bottom of the barrel either.",41,259,2019-07-22,PHARMA,0.03680759947746992,0.931900292634964,0.03129211626946926

medicine,How do you deal with the dreadful knowledge of having made mistakes?,"I’m now through the 6 first months of EM residency. I feel like I’ve become a good doctor, and that I can finally contribute and make my own decisions. At the same time I’m increasingly weighed down by a small handfull of incidents where I either made the wrong decisions, was forgetful due to being busy, or could have simply just done better. It has started to increasingly affect the way I work (I slow down the department due to double or tripple-checking everything, calling in maybe not so necessary consults, or ordering extra unnecessary tests- juust to make sure) - I feel like I’m becoming way to defensive in my approach to medicine in order to avoid mistakes, which sometimes just slows down or completely paralyzes progress of certain patients. It has also started to affect me personally - when I’m off work and should just enjoy being with my family, I spend an increasing amount of time worrying about whether this patient is going to be OK, or whether that incident will end up in a complaint, or eventually end up affecting my residency or ultimately my license. I need a healthy and good way to deal with this, otherwise I feel like I’m not going to last long in this career, even though I love it and feel like I’m good at it! Any help is appreciated!

### BACKGROUND:

There are increasing concerns about risks associated with aspirin discontinuation in the absence of major surgery or bleeding. We investigated whether long-term low-dose aspirin discontinuation and treatment gaps increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

#### METHODS:

We performed a cohort study of 601 527 users of low-dose aspirin for **primary or secondary prevention** in the Swedish prescription register between 2005 and 2009 who were &gt;40 years of age, were free from previous cancer, and had ≥80% adherence during the first observed year of treatment. Cardiovascular events were identified with the Swedish inpatient and cause-of-death registers. The first 3 months after a major bleeding or surgical procedure were excluded from the time at risk.

#### RESULTS:

During a median of 3.0 years of follow-up, 62 690 cardiovascular events occurred. **Patients who discontinued aspirin had a higher rate of cardiovascular events than those who continued (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-1.41), corresponding to an additional cardiovascular event observed per year in 1 of every 74 patients who discontinue aspirin.** The risk increased shortly after discontinuation and did not appear to diminish over time.

#### CONCLUSIONS:

In long-term users, discontinuation of low-dose aspirin in the absence of major surgery or bleeding was associated with a &gt;30% increased risk of cardiovascular events. Adherence to low-dose aspirin treatment in the absence of major surgery or bleeding is likely an important treatment goal.",35,65,2019-07-23,PHARMA,0.12534166872501373,0.8487041592597961,0.02595413848757744

pharmacy,Procedure regarding touching dropped pills?,"So we recently had a customer put in multiple complaints because they saw a technician touch a pill. The pill had apparently fallen off the counting tray onto the counter, so the tech picked it up and placed it back on the tray. Unfortunately, the customer who witnessed this deemed it unacceptable and has since been repeatedly calling the pharmacy manager asking about our policies, putting in customer complaints, and requesting contact info for higher ups in the company. They haven’t put in a complaint to the Board that we know of yet, but I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if they do. 

Anyway, due to this whole situation, I’m now very curious as to what other pharmacies do in regards to touching pills. We actually called our State Board to ask about it, and their response was not really practical, in my opinion. They said that while there are no laws about it, best practice is never to touch a patient’s medication, and you should use the spatula to pull the pill off the edge of the counter back onto the counting tray. They recommended that you could put on gloves to pick it up, but that you would need to change gloves between each medication that you touched. Same thing for a checking pharmacist pouring pills into their hand to check. They also said the counting trays, spatulas, boats for the scales, and anything that touches medication should be cleaned between *each and every* prescription. Obviously in a busy pharmacy we don’t have time for that. And tossing out every dropped pill would result in significant loss. Honestly as long as everyone is washing their hands, keeping clean, and minimizing the pill touching as much as possible, I don’t see the issue.

TO WHOM IT CONCERN at ACGME;

Im writing this to inform you of some severe injustices being done to residents at *****Medicine Program.  This is done on part of many residents here who concern.  I have talked to a lot of the people who completed training from this program and they share the same concerns 

OUr daytime attendings are mean to interns and expect too much out of us; we need to learn how to do orders and present and how to do things like read EKGs and except patients before we can actually present like second years and it makes rounding take too long.  THis impacts patient safety issues. 

A nattending is trying to make senior years violate ACGMEregulations by doing admissions for interns and saying we did them at rounds if admitted overnite.  They make the senior write the admit order and things for serious things we need to know how to do to save lives. We have no way of learning.

People get singled out to give answers during rounds and it is unfair and creates an oppressive place to learn.

**** Medical Company uses residents to make extra money.  They bill intern notes as resident notes and it is fraud,.

Specialists are abbusive and this is harassment and abusive behavior.  They do not want interns calling which is not fair and we cannot learn.

pharmacy,"New medical residents, bless their hearts .","July is almost done, and some of us in the hospital setting have come to meet the new medical residents. Pharmacist interventions seem to always spike up this time of the year due to order clarifications, medication optimizations, and therapeutic recommendations. I don’t know about some of my inpatient colleagues, but it’s nice (at least most of the time) to call the new medical residents and have teaching moments with them, let them know to avail the pharmacists for medication-related queries. 

Sure, sometimes we roll our eyes and think “wtf is this order?” but then I realize as I talk to my med school friends, their pharmacology curriculum can be lacking. This is where we insert ourselves with our super power medication knowledge.

“Oh you wanna replete patients’ phos prior to surgery that’s scheduled in 2 hours, so you want to run the infusion faster than 4 hours? No can do, gotta be concern for extravasation and phlebitis”.

“Oh you ordered polyethylene glycol for hyperkalemia? Nah, I think you meant to order sodium polystyrene sulfonate”.

“Oh you wanna order IV morphine prn pain for ESRD patient? I wouldn’t do that, active metabolites can accumulate, do dilaudid instead”.

Just some of the joyful phone conversations I had today in the first hour of my shift.

I can tell though that they are very thankful for these recommendations. Also helps them shine during rounds with their team and attending.

medicine,Medical ethics- direct patient care/contact while under the influence of benzodiazepines,"I want to first start off my apologising if this is not allowed. I am aware of the medical ethic group, but it does not seem too active and I need an answer soon, as I face this issue daily.

I work in a doctor's and one of the medical assistant takes xanax like it is candy, she has proven to be addicted to it and non functioning (even more so than now) without it. It's my personal opinion that her use of the medication has directly resulted in the lack of patient care. She has become forgetful of simple task and has proven she can't keep up with the work required. She has given wrong medication injection and vaccinations, due to forgetfulness. She has been extremely rude to staff, management, even patients. Her inability to meet the minimum expectations for her provider was made it so everyone else has to pick up her slack, so her patients get what they need. Each provider in mu practice has their own MA, so when she doesn't do her stuff, it falls to the others. In my opinion this causes the other providers patients to get the level care they should, because the MA's are spread thin trying to cover the one in question. The issue has been reported to my office manager, by our assistant office manager, but the manager does not see the effect.  I'm tired of patient care being effected, because she wants to pop xanax. I believe when at work, patient care about ALL else. Patients first, afterall that why we go into clinical healthcare. Is direct patient care under the influence of benzodiazepines ethically (if not legally wrong)? If it is ethically wrong, should I report it to our partners company (I work for a hospital in a primary care office)?",41,68,2019-07-30,PHARMA,0.09936320781707764,0.8781153559684753,0.022521449252963066
medicine,Trying to make sense of a code we had today.,"I'm a scribe in an ED and today I saw the weirdest code. There was a lot of speculation about the possible causes behind the patient's presentation but since we're not going to get any answers, I figured I'd write about it here to see if anyone has any ideas or can help me make sense of it. I've changed the details of this case to protect anonymity.

A patient in his 40s with zero PMHx presented via EMS after a syncopal episode preceded by multiple episodes of vomiting at breakfast. Pt's mom states they'd just finished eating and he just doubled over, vomited for about 20 minutes, then passed out. When EMS got there he was A/Ox3, 12-lead showed sinus tach, O2 sat in the 80s. He presented super diaphoretic and about 2 minutes after arrival he syncopized again. EKG at this time showed sinus tach. Breath sounds were clear. Blood glucose 122.

At this point they became hypoxic, O2 sat 70s, and would go in and out of apnea even with vigorous sternal rubbing. When he would wake for brief periods of time he was very agitated, trying to remove his NRB and get out of bed. This lasted for about 5 minutes before the final LOC at which time he stopped breathing, was cyanotic, and HR dropped into the 30s. Then pulse check: none. Pupils were found to be dilated to 8 mm but equal and reactive. No hx of benzo/stimulant use. Pt was moved to a bigger room, bagged, compressions started.

8 rounds of epi, 2 rounds of bicarb, 4000 of heparin, and an epi drip later, the patient had ROSC 6 times only to lose it a minute later. At one point the monitor looked STEMI-ish so another EKG was done showing ST elevations in V3 and V4, but depressions in I, aVL, V5, and V6. He was coded for about 45 minutes total.

Talking to family, it seems they have a strong history of sudden cardiac arrest at a young age. But what's up with the EKG findings and the dilated pupils? This was a perfectly healthy person; no DM, no CAD, no HTN. It was just so weird how quickly everything went from a vasovagal-sounding syncope to a code.
