medicine,[Serious] Can I ask a question to the American doctors in this sub? What happens to psychiatric patients without insurance?,"So I'm from UK, and as you all probably know, our healthcare system is funded by the taxpayer with little-to-no cost at the point of care. Because of this the issue of insurance/payment is very rarely seen. But I really have very little idea about how your system functions, so some insight would be nice.

Often when somebody has severe mental health issues, they tend to drift down the socioeconomic ladder and wouldn't necessarily have the means to afford insurance or pay bills. Also other patients can of course refuse seeing medical attention so as not to pay, but there may be some mandatory inpatient stays - be it through lack of capacity, safety or through the courts - which can obviously be lengthy and costly. In the community psychiatric patients can need lots of costly care as well.

So I was wondering with these patients, do they fall under something like Medicaid? Or do they have to pay out of pocket? Or are they just not treated?

I would just like to know how it's handled in the US, as it's something I've always wondered about.",38,38,2015-02-01,PHARMA,0.03407425433397293,0.929184079170227,0.03674161806702614

pharmacy,"A coworker posted this to her facebook. I find it hilarious. Management, not so much.","Ways customers can impress their local pharmacy technicians:

1) Bang on the counter when you want service. It looks smart and makes you feel tough.

2) Be sure to stare at us when we're filling your prescription. It makes us work faster.

3) Make sure you save all your old insurance cards. One of our favorite games is to guess which one is current.

4) When your refill for maintenance meds have expired, always question why we need a new prescription from your doctor, when you have been taking them for years. It's only a myth that medications must be ordered by your doctor.

5) When you drop off your prescription, tell us you'll pick it up in 20 minutes, or tomorrow. That kind of clarity really helps us plan our daily workload.

6) Always complain about your copay. We set them at our discretion, and they have nothing to do with your insurance company.

7) When there are several people in front of you at the pickup line, go straight to the second register and glare at us. We will know how important you are and hurry out to wait on you first, instead of the people who were there before you

8) It isn't necessary to give us your new insurance information. We are psychic and know everyone's different information

9) Never remember the name of the medicine you want refilled. By calling it 'the little yellow one', we will know which one that is, and will not fill the wrong order by accident.

10) Come in 5 minutes before closing to drop off a prescription that was written 10 days ago, and tell us you desperately need the medication tonight. Then after we stay late to fill it for you after the pharmacy is closed, demand that we give you a flu shot.",38,118,2015-02-09,PHARMA,0.05347421392798424,0.9125721454620361,0.03395365923643112

medicine,Solo practitioner family medicine... barely treading water and going under,"Please don't be harsh. I'm writing this because where else can you share these problems and someone may understand, on some level? Perhaps this is a warning to the newbies. Maybe I'm just releasing some of my stress and concern because I can't share this with my husband.

My husband. We stayed in the town of his residency because the FP population was aging and we thought we could serve. We opened a private practice that was high in demand. The hospital promised to launch a hospitalist program but it never happened. The time away from our family was too much for too little so, after many emails and attempts to find a solution, my husband gave up his privileges which turned the hospital against him.

Eight years later and today we're making over $100k less than we used to. I have no problem tightening the belt-- I'm not a stereotypical ""doctor's wife."" But we have $140k in student loan debt, we're behind on property taxes on a house we bought before we saw the changes coming (I'll get to that), we're already on a payment plan for federal taxes... We're trapped inside a small cage that's sinking and we can't escape. We can't borrow money to fix things because there's no more money to pay loans back. 

The hospital, that has literally turned their back on us, now has a hospitalist program. They also have purchased all but 4 of the local FP practices, the other three are close to retirement. They insure their own staff and have large financial incentives that keep their employees in their own system. We're losing patients... not to mention the deductibles going so high that the ones we have aren't paying their bills.

I'm writing this because this morning I watched my husband in his chair, rubbing his head, looking at our bank accounts on his iPad. We have $4k in our accounts and bills that you can't imagine. Payroll is next week so we have to pay what we can and start preparing for payroll next week as we do each week... over and over and over.

It's only going to get worse. But we have this house that we can't afford (don't think it's grossly expensive-- $340k), we can barely afford to fix it up but we hope to sell it/get out from underneath it. We want to relocate to another state where he can work for a larger entity... but can we extract ourselves from this situation? This morning my sweet husband said ""I can see why physicians kill themselves."" He has been talking about all of the other choices he could have made for his life: engineering, research, even making furniture... 

There's no way out of this, it seems... And what once made him happy he now loathes. My husband hates and resents his job. His patients adore him and he's a talented, good, honest man. He's been generous to a fault and now it's killing him. It's so hard to watch. He has gained weight, has chest pains regularly... but he keeps moving forward.

Anyway... just sending this out there into the abyss because I don't know what to do. Maybe there's a suggestion out there? Someone who can commiserate? I certainly can't cry on any shoulders in real life... how do you complain to a friend about finances when your husband is a DOCTOR.",142,265,2015-02-11,PHARMA,0.0742676705121994,0.8994598388671875,0.02627248503267765

Are there common tests/treatments that are a ""blind spot"" for cost?","As an internal medicine intern, I do a lot of electrolyte repletion on the wards. I had been getting daily Magnesium serum levels on all my heart failure patients, in addition to their regular labs (CBC / chem8). I learned a few days ago that my hospital bills the patient about $120 for each Mg2+ check, so I stopped doing that daily - now I do it like q72h, unless my attending gets upset about that and wants me to check it more frequently.

Something else I had no idea was expensive: Amlodipine. Apparently a 30-day supply costs about $80, according to ePocrates. Compared to all the $4 alternatives, this is an arm and a leg. This first-line drug for Htn just became a second-line drug for me. I will preferentially start Hctz in treatment-naive patients now that I've learned of the expense of Amlodipine. Previously I had been using them about interchangeably. Of course, if a patient is already on one and uncontrolled, I'll start the other unless there's a good reason to prefer BB/ACE-I.

Im an undergrad and I've been working as a tech for almost 8 months now at a pharmacy about 25 minute drive from campus. I go to school in a very secluded area of my state so theres not a lot of pharmacies in the area, and I took one of the only available jobs at the time.

However, I just got a call from one of the only pharmacies in my college town (less than 5 minute drive) for an interview. Now I realize I haven't go the job yet, but in the case I do, my question is:

What could I do, as a tech, to make life easier on the pharmacists (the entire staff actually) of the pharmacy I may quit at? They're understaffed (like most retails) and the people I work with are some of the absolute nicest people and I want to make sure I don't screw them over when I leave, especially because they had a really hard time finding techs before I was hired. Also, I kinda would really like a letter of req from them for pharmacy school so I have to leave on good terms lol.

medicine,[US] Can doctors get jobs pretty much anywhere?,"Really general question. Probably general to the point that it's useless.

I know it varies by specialty and location but **how's the job market for physicians in general? Is it easy to relocate, perhaps even without connections in the area you're going to?**

I ask 'cause I'm from Austin--went to college there and everything--but in August I'll be going to a Tx med school not located in Austin (theirs doesn't open till 2016). I'd like to go back to Austin some day after residency. My question is really .... is relocation easy for MDs/DOs? I know you get roots where you do your residency and fellowship. There's obviously demand but does that demand hold in marquee urban areas?

If it helps right now I picture myself as EM (volunteered a lot in that dept.). That'll change, of course.

---------



I know it's way too early in my career to be asking. Just getting some perspective on it from people who've been in the job market.

pharmacy,Tech trouble... Not sure how to handle.,"Relatively new pharmacist looking for some advice from those of you who have been in the game longer than me. Techs, feel free to chime in. 

Background: our only full time tech went down to one day per pay period because she got a better job in a hospital. We had been borrowing a tech (I'll call her Karen) from a nearby store since we had more hours but no one on staff to work them. My pharmacy manager decided to transfer Karen into our store full time and hire another part time tech. I've had a hard time working with Karen from the start because she's unreliable and has a tendency to call out a few minutes before she's supposed to start a shift - usually when I'm working - or will show up and ask to leave an hour later. I also suspect her of drug use because some days she is completely erratic and seems to have a totally different personality. Her default setting seems to be half-assed on most of her shifts with me and I find myself doing half the tasks she should be doing as well as my own job. 

The store we transferred her from was glad to get rid of her because the (young, female) pharmacy manager there had all the same problems with her that I have. Oddly enough she got on well with the staff pharmacist there, who is an older male. Here she seems to have a problem working under me - a younger female - but is a completely different employee when she works with the pharmacy manager here, who happens to be an older male. Karen is in her late 40s and my theory is she has a problem taking direction from someone young enough to be her daughter. My theory is supported by what I've heard from my other tech, who says it's like night and day difference when Karen is working with me vs the pharmacy manager. 

I've tried being more assertive with her but even when I give a direct order she will find a way to ignore it. A recent example is the other day when she was hiding around the corner texting and I told her she had a customer at the counter. She looked right at me, then looked back down and finished her text before helping the customer. She's insubordinate as hell and I hate having to treat her like a child to keep her focused. I've never had these types of problems working with other technicians. 

I've also discussed her behavior at length with the pharmacy manager who has discussed it with her in the past, but it never seems to stick. It doesn't help that she works harder when he's there, so I'm afraid that he's starting to think it's a personal vendetta against her. 

Today I was very close to a breaking point with her. A few weeks ago I got onto her about using my computer to do an emergency supply for a patient without asking me (only a pharmacist is supposed to do an emergency supply), and I found out yesterday she did the same thing when a floater was in over the weekend, except this time she gave out an entire box of insulin pens as an emergency supply. When I told her it wasn't her decision to make she tried to argue then ended up pouting for a long time after. I didn't think anything else of it until I came back for the evening shift today. She waited until the other technician was nearby and out of nowhere said ""by the way, I talked to (pharmacy manager) today and he said he would have loaned out the insulin and it was ok that I did."" I told her that I disagreed and that regardless she needed to check with the pharmacist on duty. I'm 100% certain that it was meant to be a challenge and that she wanted the other tech to see it go down. 

If we were in high school I would've already been past the point of slamming her up against her locker and telling her off. Obviously that's not something I can or will do but I am really at a loss on how I can continue to work with her. I don't care if she likes me but I hate all the tension, and her insubordination just gets worse the more assertive I try to be.
