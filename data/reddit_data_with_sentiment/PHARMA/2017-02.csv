medicine,"Naturopaths painting themselves as primary care providers in Canada: ""Medically Trained. Naturally Focused""","I work in Canada as a family doctor.

I'm sure most of us have experiences with naturopaths misleading our patients with pseudoscientific testing and selling them snake oil like IV vitamin infusions.

In many parts of Canada, they have prescription rights, can do minor procedures and order investigations. In order to get certified for these things, they literally complete an online module and do an open book multiple choice exam. No joke.

Then, two hours later, we draw another sample and recheck immunoglobulin levels. 

Will the immunoglobulins be ""diluted"" in the new blood, resulting in lower ig levels than baseline? What about after 24 hours?

Does the immune system sense the decrease in circulating blood/increase in new blood production and amp up its immunoglobulin production to make up for what was lost?

medicine,First week as a doctor and I couldn't be happier,"Hi! 

This week has been a rollercoaster. I started my very first job as a doctor this Monday morning. I got a pager, a phone and a key card and was basically let go to roam free in a hospital I've never been in before, working with a computer system I've never used before and more importantly making decisions about things I've never made before.

I've been stressed, swamped with patients I didn't know what to do with and confused by the system and by how the hospital was organised. All week long a steady stream of nurses have been asking me questions I haven't been able to answer with confidence, at best only mildly annoyed by how slowly I process my patients. Me getting lost on my way to whatever ward or department I'm paged to hasn't helped.

I left the hospital this Friday afternoon, having the luxury of the weekend off, and for the first time this week I've been able to take a step back and process the experience. I've had a large grin on my face since. Despite all the stress, anxiety and self doubt I've experienced this week,  I can't wait to go back on Monday. I love that I'm no longer a med student, with no real responsibility. I love that I get to make decisions and stand by them. I love that I get to learn from my mistakes, of which I've made a handful of already. I love that I get to try to help patients, even though their gratitude in many cases is non-existent. I love that I get to come back, knowing a little more than the day before. Obviously, I know that difficult times will come and they will be tough to deal with. I'll try to do my best to deal with them when they come, but for now I'm gonna kick back with a beer and be grateful for having the best job I could imagine. Have a good one people!",57,555,2017-02-03,PHARMA,0.07434365898370743,0.8890044093132019,0.036651983857154846
medicine,Letter from the CEO of ACGME re: the recent immigration executive order,"Just received this email - I felt it to be powerful. The numbers are larger than I expected.

""February 2, 2017


Dear Members of the Graduate Medical Education Community,
 
Since the Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,” was issued on Friday, January 27, the ACGME leadership has been working with the leadership of the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), and other organizations to understand the details of the policies announced, and the implications for our current and future residents and fellows.

There are over 10,000 licensed physicians in the US who graduated from medical schools in one of the seven countries named in the Executive Order (EO). Some of these physicians practice in underserved communities through the Conrad 30 Waiver Program that permits International Medical Graduates (IMGs) to remain in the United States after graduation in order to provide care to medically underserved communities. They are a valued and welcomed group of colleagues.

There are currently approximately 1800 physicians enrolled in ACGME-accredited residency and fellowship programs who graduated from medical schools in the seven named countries. These physicians are providing much-needed medical care to a conservatively estimated 900,000 patients in urban, suburban, and rural communities across the country annually. They too are a valued and welcomed group of colleagues.

The ACGME, through its requirements and eligibility standards, articulates the values of our profession. Discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, or other factors is a violation of our personal and professional values. To this end, we have worked with the AAMC and others to co-author a letter to President Trump representing the values of the profession, and concerns over these actions.

The ACGME is committed to programs in support of their residents, fellows, designated institutional officials, program directors, and the entire GME community through the disruption and uncertainty created by the EO. Our function on behalf of the medical community is to create an optimal clinical learning environment for residents and fellows in order to ensure that patients receive the highest quality of care. We will provide, as soon as we have it, authoritative information to you, through our combined efforts with the AAMC, ECFMG, and others, through our website and links to other authoritative sources.

Most importantly, we will continue to point out to the public and the profession the profound moral distress this EO has provoked within the health care community. We all know or know of individuals who have been directly affected by this event. What is not often as obvious is the anxiety and frustration it provokes in others indirectly impacted by the event. We might have concern for a colleague or friend, concern for family members, concern for contagion, or merely anger and frustration over the affront to personal and professional values. We encourage programs to spend time discussing these events, respecting all viewpoints, and deciding on actions where indicated to reaffirm our values, and support those in distress. This is a “teachable moment” for all of us. Let's use it to make ourselves more committed to our values, less tolerant of discrimination and disparities, more supportive of inclusion, and more courageous in our pursuit of equity and excellence, kindness, compassion, and quality medical care for the American public.

We will continue to work with the ECFMG, which serves as the “IMGs' Dean's Office,” while residents apply to US residency and fellowship programs, as well as with the AAMC, which operates the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS®) program for applicants, to provide the best available information. A set of FAQs is in the process of being finalized. We will post those as soon as they are ready, and continue to update them as information becomes available. We greatly appreciate the work of our colleagues at the AAMC and ECFMG in crafting responses to these questions with us.

We also greatly appreciate the response we have received from individuals and groups who are concerned about the physicians impacted by the EO, and the ultimate impact on patient care in the United States. We will continue to monitor the situation, assess the implications, and provide updates on behalf of our residents and fellows, GME programs and institutions, and the broad GME community. Updates can be found at on our website and on our Twitter feed.

In closing, please use this opportunity to reaffirm and articulate our values. This should include “not giving up” on our international graduate applicants this year. Our colleagues from other countries have cared for America and Americans for generations. We must not abandon them now, as they search for the American Dream we often have taken for granted. 
 
Sincerely,

medicine,"""I Had to Get Cancer to Become a More Empathetic Doctor""","**Ann Intern Med. 2016;165(7):525-526**

--- 

Listen to the patient—they are telling you the diagnosis. I first heard these words, apocryphally attributed to Sir William Osler, from the white-haired senior physician at Harvard who greeted us on our first day of medical school in 1956. For the last 50-plus years, I have taught this as a guiding precept to medical students and residents. “Listen, you learn from what patients tell you, both spoken and unspoken.” I still teach that to the fellows at Temple Medical School and the medical students at Drexel. I am 80 and a retired infectious diseases physician. I've always thought of myself as a caring, compassionate, and warm doctor. I thought I knew what patients were feeling, but it has taken being a physician with a life-threatening illness to understand what it is really like to be a patient.


Two and a half years ago, my new primary care doctor told me, “You have a 7-centimeter mass in the left kidney.” My wife and I had just returned from a vacation in Spain. I had microscopic hematuria, but I had put off the ultrasound until we got back. I had not expected these results. “I am a physician—I should be immune to this.” Denial is a common defense mechanism when shocking news like this hits a patient. There was little doubt in my mind that the 7-centimeter mass was cancer.


Self-recrimination and anger at my previous doctors arose. There'd been 5 to 10 red blood cells in my urine for at least 5 years—why no ultrasound before now? Was it too easy to believe, as did my doctors and I, that the red blood cells came from my enlarged prostate? Over time, the anger at all of my doctors who ignored (or wrote off) this abnormal test result dissipated as I realized I was equally complicit (as a knowledgeable physician) in not wanting to pursue further testing. Lesson One: Wishful thinking is not reality.


The first phase was diagnosis. Things moved quickly; I scheduled an appointment with the head of urology. He was middle-aged—I felt old. He was calm and reassuring. “Kidney cancers are slow-growing tumors,” he explained. The urologist scheduled an MRI and said, “You know, this is not an oh-my-God moment.” I thought then of how often as a physician I had minimized my patients' fears with such facile reassurances.


The MRI showed spread to the ipsilateral adrenal gland. The second phase was treatment for cure. Surgery followed quickly to remove my kidney and adrenal gland. After about 6 months, I began to feel better and had my first follow-up MRI and chest radiograph. Both were clear. My wife and I were elated and started making plans to travel until the radiologist looked more carefully and saw a small shadow on the MRI just above the diaphragm. A subsequent CT scan dashed our optimism when the urologist called to tell us, without preamble, “You have 15 metastases in both lungs.” Lesson Two: Telling a patient the truth is important, but there are ways to soften the blow of bad news without minimizing it. However, in my experience, there is no way to tell it without inflicting some pain on the patient.


I soon met my role model for a caring and competent clinician. The head of solid tumor oncology was thoughtful, reassuring, and kind to my wife and me. He looked us both in the eye, listened to us carefully, and answered our questions. The kindness that he did not hesitate to show was welcome and makes all the difference to a patient. He told us that five chemotherapeutic agents were available to me; 5 years ago there was only one, which was very toxic. He said, “I favor Votrient: It has been effective and has fewer side effects.” I appreciated his stating his clear preference for a therapeutic agent rather than cataloging them and asking me to decide. Like most patients, I knew very little about this area and could not have made an informed choice among all the therapeutic options. I was grateful to have a plan for treatment and to move forward. I also appreciated the importance and impact of clear and effective communication in a warm dialogue.
We now entered the phase of treatment without potential for cure. It was not easy. I had diarrhea and vomiting for 5 days, lost 10 pounds, and soiled myself. I felt ashamed and humiliated and scared of what was happening. Because I couldn't reach the doctor, I called the oncology nurse who told me to stop the chemotherapy, rehydrate, and go on the BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, and tea) diet. “It will get better,” she said.


“What about my taste? Everything is metallic.”


“Maybe it will reverse, but that is less likely.”


Now I understand what my patients who took antibiotics and got taste perversion were complaining about. It had been all too easy for me to say, “But this drug is saving your life,” with the unspoken, “Stop whining.” Lesson Three: Side effects are only minor if they are not happening to you. As a physician, don't minimize patients' discomfort.


When nothing is working and you feel miserable, desperation sets in and you will try anything for relief. I used to grow impatient with patients who wanted me to do something else when I was doing all I knew possible. But so much else was possible, even if unproven. I began to understand the lure of alternative and holistic medicine. My subsequent experiences with acupuncture and herbal medicine have taught me their value. They also offer hope, a quality that patients need to cling to if they are to survive. Lesson Four: Don't dismiss alternative therapies just because you don't know much about them. Even if some of the benefit is placebo effect, the patient is happy that something is working.


I now see that the medical system is layered to shield the doctor from direct contact with the patient (except at appointment time). I had considered myself accessible to patients; I returned telephone calls as soon as I could, but they weren't my highest priority. Triage demanded that life-threatening infections be handled first.


A patient's burning anxiety over a “less severe issue” could wait. I am now a patient, and I have learned to rely on the oncology nurses; however, it is still galling that I cannot easily reach the doctor when I am scared or anxious or just want to hear his voice. If I, as a fellow physician, can't easily get through the secretaries and nurses whom we, as doctors, have interposed, what happens to most patients who can't “work the system”? They are left with their anxieties.


“Scan anxiety” is real. For the week preceding the scan, my wife and I traded our anxieties even as we tried to mask them. I was in constant fear of new lesions or that old ones would have enlarged, that this would be the beginning of the end. We don't get the results until the day after the scan. Until the oncologist says, “The scan is unchanged,” I am in full fight-or-flight mode, and I barely sleep. What were my patients' feelings, lacking medical knowledge and perspective? I have come to respect and understand scan anxiety now in a way I did not previously. It is a dread that is common to all patients with cancer who are followed with scans. I am not sure there is any way to minimize it.


I once told one of my many physicians, “I hate being a patient—it is a loss of control for me.” The paternalism that I grew up with in medicine in the 80s and early 90s has ostensibly diminished, but partnership with the patient is never totally realistic when one partner (the patient) lacks information, expertise, and experience. Even as an experienced physician, I know I need to rely on the oncologist's skill to make an intelligent decision. I have learned how anxious this inequality in our relationship makes me feel; it has taught me to empathize more with all patients. Despite my tremendous advantages of knowledge and experience compared with most patients, I still find myself overwhelmed at times. My oncologist's ability to deal with my issues in communications that are clear, tactful, considerate, helpful, and realistic in a free and warm dialogue helps immensely but doesn't completely mitigate the sense of giving up the control I once had as a physician.


I am a better doctor and human being as a result of enduring this illness—I just wish there had been an easier way to get to that place.

PD chewed me out, saying if the patient died I would be fired. Went on to say contracts would be renewed soon and mine would not be renewed if I was not happy with my decision to do surgery and to do surgery at my program. I told PD I regretted it almost every day because the hours are terrible, 80-100/week, and this is not the life I envisioned. I like the operations but I dont know that I can deal with the complications of the procedures. PD states the hours don't get better and while theres more satisfaction with actually getting in the OR, the responsibility increases and family time isn't something really compatible with the job. I have really felt down but don't know if this is just what every surgery resident is supposed to feel intern year.

medicine,Having some issues with a nurse. Could use some advice.,"Hi there -- I am having issues with one of the nurses at my clinic and I need some advice on how to best approach the situation. 

Background: this nurse is an LPN. She has been in trouble in the past -- has gotten written up, has almost gotten fired... etc. She is difficult to work with, and most people have expressed concerns about working with her. In a nutshell, she is very disrespectful, appears ""bothered"" when being asked to do things that are part of her job (e.g. give vaccines), and has also made racially-charged comments that have made me feel quite uncomfortable. She has also undermined my authority on several occasions. The job has truly become quite hostile -- she is talking to other members of the team complaining that I ""ask her to do stuff"", and encouraging others to complain about me and the fact that I ask them to do their jobs. 

I have brought up these concerns in the past and the nursing supervisor has said that ""because my concerns are hearsay, she can't really do much about it."" Today, I said -- okay, then please do not pair me with this particular nurse, because she makes my job extremely hard and I don't want any part of that. Then the nursing supervisor said ""well why don't you switch clinics?"" to which I replied ""you want me to switch clinics... and take my full patient panel with me, instead of moving a support staff member?"" Her response was that the other nurse ""had been there longer."" 

I am baffled. 

I know this is going to sound elitist --- but I feel like that comparison is completely ridiculous. It doesn't matter who has been there longer, because our jobs are not the same.

I spoke to my medical director about it and he also seemed baffled at that response. I am hoping he will be able to make something happen. 

Basically, I'm just looking for some advice, because I'm feeling pretty down at the moment. And for some reason, I really can't seem to be able to let that comment go. I honestly am getting to the point where I want to go work somewhere else. I feel insulted. 

Thanks for reading me. 



***********UPDATE***************

1) I wrote a letter to the nursing supervisor following-up on our conversation to make sure everything was documented. I sent it to my medical director first and asked for feedback prior to sending it to the nursing supervisor. He said ""Well said. Our bar should be a high one with respect to patient care and working team environments. I believe (nursing supervisor) is out today, but you should get a response as soon as she returns.""

2) I had talked to the union last week. Today I got a text from the union steward saying that ""the employee had been talked to and that I should notice a change in my interactions with her, and that if that wasn't the case, I should let him know so that we can talk about what additional steps could be taken to ensure that I had a safe and respectful work environment.

3) I barely interacted with her yesterday, but my attitude towards her has shifted from ""hey, can you do this?"" to ""hey, this person needs to be put in a room and they need this and that.""

4) I have not heard back from nursing supervisor yet... (Shocker)

5) If I don't hear from nursing supervisor by the end of the week, I will talk to medical director again. I think things are slightly beyond the point of ""the union rep talked to her and told her to chill."" She's been talked to plenty of times. 



Extra... here's the letter I wrote, in case anyone is interested: 

(Nursing supervisor), 

I am writing to follow-up with you in regards to the conversation we had on Wednesday, February 8th in which I inquired as to the status of the concerns I had brought forward involving (LPN)’s inability to perform the functions that are required of her, in accordance to her job description and role as a licensed practical nurse. 

You relayed to me that there was nothing you could do to address said concerns, and that the staff member in question was “doing her job and just giving me an attitude about it.” You also asked me why I needed this staff member’s help, considering that my primary assistant is (Nurse 2), even though you are aware that support staff is required to assist the team as a whole, particularly when her primary physician out of the office, as it is the case on (days her primary person is out.)

As a response to my request not to have me paired with this staff member in the future – because her attitude and unwillingness to assist are interfering with my job to provide high quality care to patients – you suggested that I switch clinic sites. I asked why you thought that would be a good solution, and your response was that this support staff member had been here longer than I have. I am sure you can appreciate the complexity surrounding moving a physician – the only bilingual pediatric physician who is taking great care of a multitude of patients – to a different clinic, in response to a support staff member who is hindering the delivery of that care and not performing the job that she has been hired to do. There are many patients – families – who come to this clinic to see me, and with whom I have formed a therapeutic relationship. Suggesting that I move to a different site is certainly damaging to my team – but more importantly, it is damaging to our patients, and my commitment to them is of utmost significance. 

I have discussed with you, on multiple occasions, that this staff member is failing to fulfill her duties and compromising patient care. She is undermining my medical decision-making and overstepping boundaries. You may remember that episode in which she took it upon herself to advocate for a patient’s controlled substances being refilled, even though I had already expressed that the refill was not appropriate and could put the patient at risk; or the several other scenarios in which patient care was compromised because (LPN) was unable or unwilling to fulfill her obligations.

As I mentioned previously, you expressed that this support staff member is “doing her job but giving me an attitude about it” – but part of her job description is to “maintain effective working relationships” and to “carry out nursing services as a member of a team.” I am certain that you will agree that these are not functions that this staff member is performing – and I base this not only on her difficulties fulfilling her duties in regards to my patients, but also on the many complaints from other physicians, staff members, and patients; and the many documented conflicts in which this staff member has been involved. 

You may also recall that I approached you to discuss concerns of retaliatory activity from this nurse after it became clear that I had attempted to make a formal complaint. I explained that (LPN) was encouraging (Nurse 2) to “complain that I ask them to do too much.” Attached is a list of the functions that I have requested of (LPN) in the past. As you can see, they are all extrapolated directly from her job description. You said that unless  (Nurse 2) comes forward to confirm the behavior, there is nothing you can do. Fortunately, I am able to provide you, if needed, with written evidence that this is, indeed, something that is happening on a regular basis. In addition to this being against the clinic’s policy on retaliation, I am sure that you can understand why this type of behavior is damaging on several levels. Not only does this create more tension within the team and create a hostile work environment, it also compromises my working relationship with Nurse 2, and it encourages an excellent, hard-working support staff member to stop performing her job functions, which in turn puts the delivery of high quality, efficient patient care at risk – once again.

It is my hope that the ongoing concerning behaviors with (LPN) will be properly addressed in a timely manner. I believe that this support staff member is unable to work effectively as part of my team, and I believe that our patients would be better served if this employee were transferred to a different team. According to the union contract, the only requirement for transfer is to provide the employee with five days’ notice. Furthermore, I want to make my expectations of her – and all support staff - clear.  As a physician, I expect her to do the job that she has been hired to do.

My hands/individual fingers twitch about 1-2mm when  i try and hold them steady. It does get worse with stress/coffee but even when i am calm and caffeine free it is still slightly present. I can even tell my pulse form it as my hands bump to the rhythm of my heart. Is this level of steadiness manageable to be a surgeon (particularly an orthopaedic one or should i focus my attention on being a physician.

pharmacy,Why I resigned from my job and other pharmacy-related thoughts for pharmacists and managers,"I've handed in my notice at the retail pharmacy that I've been at for about three months. I've been a Pharmacy Assistant for about six years. Now I will have a glass of whisky and list my grievances.

***Grievance the First: Don't drag me down with you***


I know that I am not a pharmacist. That does not mean that I am not a human being with my own professional and ethical standards. If I refuse to do something that I feel is illegal, unethical and would not meet professional standards, respect that and **do it yourself**. I am not an automaton. I want to take care of our customers and I've been in this game for long enough that if I feel compelled to refuse to do something, you should probably stop and think twice. 

I am not being insubordinate if I refuse to prepare your narcotic advances under my ScriptPro credentials and log them under my software credentials. **You** decided to do this customer a favour, do it yourself. That doesn't mean I'm going to call the cops and turn you in. It just means I want nothing to do with it. When you do these things without a paper trail --  and everyone who does it is meticulous that there be no paper trail -- my name is the only name attached because **everything is logged**. Sure, you saved yourself from having to put your signature and license number to the advance but my initials are right there: I dialled out narcotics without a valid prescription, I logged an advance with no paperwork to speak of, and certainly without any documented authority from a pharmacist or physician. I'd like to think that during an inspection you would own up to it, but how could I be sure that you wouldn't roll over on me to save your license and your six figure salary? Do you expect me to gamble my livelihood based on my trust in you? I know you certainly (and rightly) wouldn't trust me to dispense a prescription for you to sign sight unseen. So fuck off and do it yourself.

***Grievance the Second: Don't make me do stupid shit***


For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of this old false economy: some dumbass pharmacy owners insist that staff prepare and package maintenace drugs for pick up and fax the doctor for a prescription after filling. This is ridiculously illegal and inefficient and absolutely does not lead to better patient care.

The first principle of this job is that you require a prescription to obtain prescription drugs. I've been in this game for long enough that I am perfectly capable of professionally telling a customer that their doctor hasn't gotten back to us yet. If your team can't handle telling someone we are waiting for their doctor, it's because **you are shit at managing customers and their expectations**. I'm in a jurisdiction where pharmacists have the authority to issue bridging supplies of chronic medications with a long-term stable history. If you're so goddamned sure that the doctor is going to fax it back, then issue a bridging supply. Except I bet that you won't do that because you don't want to take on the liability, because you're really not quite that sure.

**Pharmacy Owners**: Fuck off and let me do my job. If this is going to be a free-for-all fucking candy store, you really don't need me here. If ""just give it to them so they keep coming back"" is your patient retention strategy, I have bad news for you: your customers probably don't even notice, your staff resent you for it, and you're going out of business.

**Pharmacy Managers**: Stand up for yourself. When the owner comes up with batshit insane policies like prefill-by-default, do the store a favour and tell him to go fuck himself and **let you manage the pharmacy**. It really is readily apparent to everyone when the Pharmacy Manager is cuckolded by the owner. And it's really sad to work with an impotent DM. Do you know those doctor's secretaries who don't seem to be able to do anything other than put you on hold for the doctor when all you needed was to confirm a license number? Yeah, that's how the pharmacy team sees you when you parrot off dumbass policies like prefilling and we know you're a good pharmacist and you don't believe in it.

**Pharmacists**: I've been in this business long enough that sure, I have a good handle on guessing what you're likely to OK an advance on and what you're not, but **I will never give out anything without your OK**. And I bet you'd be pretty irritated if I just went ahead and presumed you'd be OK with it and gave it out without checking. Now imagine how a physician feels when you do exactly that to them. I work for you, the manager, and the owner **in that order**.

If you're not OK with any given dumbfuck store policy, just tell me! If you are the Pharmacist on Duty, consider me your First Officer. That means that if you want to throw any policy that you're uncomfortable with straight out the window, go for it. I'm not going to stop you, I'm not going to undermine you and I'm not going to report you. As far as I'm concerned, that's between you and the manager/owner. I will continue to do my job according to your instructions. **IF YOU ARE THE PHARMACIST ON DUTY, YOU ARE THE BOSS. ""I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS BUT THE MANAGER/OWNER SAYS I HAVE TO"" is a bullshit cop out.**

***Grievance the Third: Stop undermining me***


We've all worked in stores with maybe a couple of pharmacists including the owner. If I make a judgement call and my Pharmacist on Duty concurs, don't roll over on us the second the patient decides to call you because they know you. Don't say ""Yes, they should have just given it to you"" or ""I'll make sure they just give it to you next time"" or any of that other bullshit. You make us look like fucking idiots -- and by us, I mean you too -- because you're essentially saying that we fucked up. Don't get me wrong, sometimes one particular pharmacist is a hardass about dispensing exactly on the due date. Your response to the customer should not be: ""They were wrong"". Be a fucking professional adult and say ""Dispensing a prescription is always at the discretion of the pharmacist on duty."" Go a step further and trying being a businessperson ""I'm sorry that you couldn't get that on Friday, what I can do is go ahead and set you up with automatic refills. I'll keep an eye on the queue and make sure that I fill your prescriptions when I'm on duty to make sure it doesn't happen again."" Just don't be a cunt and throw me under the bus because I don't know the person as well as you, or that he fixes your car or whatever reason you have for sucking this particular customer's dick. Deal with it yourself and don't expect the rest of us to do your favours for you. When something like this happens, it's usually a good time to stop and think, ""Hm, the entire pharmacy team thought this was an inappropriate thing to do. Should I encourage the customer to expect them to do it anyway, or should I manage their expectations?""


That's it for now.

tl;dr: Your pharmacy staff want to do a good job. Help us help you. We're on the same team: respect our boundaries and help make sure that customers respect us too.",29,53,2017-02-16,PHARMA,0.10444126278162003,0.8686030507087708,0.026955675333738327

medicine,Road traffic injury – what should I have done?,"Yesterday, I encountered a road traffic injury casualty (somene was hit by a car on a pedestrian crossing). Being a healthcare professional with scarce knowledge of proper management in such cases, I did my best to support the victim, who was extremely agitated and suffering from head trauma. I noticed a rather nasty femoral fracture, estimated her GCS: E4V2M4 and waited for the ambulance to come (~15 min), trying to restrain her from movement. She was in extreme distress, unable to respond to any question, and one of the bystanders reported she had a seizure following the impact. Having no background in trauma management, I realize this must have been suboptimal. Can someone answer the following questions?

– What is the right thing to do in the event of a road traffic accident, when the victim is hit by a car?

– What kind of endeavours should be avoided?

– When it seems plausible to attempt to stabilize the fractures in such conditions?

medicine,How do we get the ball rolling on a physicians' union?,"Everywhere I look, it seems like scope, salary, influence, leadership, and autonomy of MDs and DOs are increasingly threatened now in the future by encroachment from larger, more active, and thus, more powerful lobbying bodies of RNs, NPs, PAs, chiropractors, and NDs.  It also seems that most MDs and DOs, while there may be some ""yeah, good luck with that!"" attitudes, agree with the notion that we must unionize and lobby just like they do to protect our interests.  Having achieved our high status, leadership, and financial compensation long ago, we have all just sort of sat back and let everything happen, content with where we are instead of safeguarding our careers for the future.

The AMA clearly isn't serving its purpose in protecting our interests.  Most physicians in America don't even belong to it.  If the majority of us are willing to support a legitimate physician union or lobbying group in America, then why do we continue to watch as other professions encroach on us?  When will we do something about it?

I want to bring back some teeth to the political presence of physicians in America, but I don't know where to start.  I am aware it is not nearly as simple as it may seem, by far.  I know that private practice physicians would not be able to participate (at least, as far as I know at this point), but there has to be something we can do other than WATCH as other professions threaten our scope of practice, our territory, our financial compensation, and our hard-earned position as the leaders in healthcare.

medicine,Let's say I wanted to approach the prep fo my internal medicine inpatient rotation by learning the 10 most common diseases/conditions as well as possible; what are they?,"My premise is this: I have a 4 months internal medicine inpatient rotation coming up (intern year). At my institution that means primary floor management with support when shit hits the fan. I do  not know before hand which inpatient services I will be with so in-depth preparation is out of the question. Instead, I would like to figure out an approximate list of the top x most common clinical scenarios; i.e. diseases, conditions and their management. I will learn this as well as possible which will free time to tackle specifics during the chaos of inpatient medicine. 

I'd like to hear meddits views on what that list should be. 

In my mind the criteria would be something on the lines of: 

* a) Common condition in inpatient medicine. 
* b) correct management is at least semi-acute. 
* c) does not normally require sub-specialty consults or interventions

Examples of what I was thinking of (+ suggestions so far)

1. Logical approach to chest pain
 - ACS / MI
1. Logical approach to SOB 
 - Decompensated heart failure
 - COPD exacerbation
 - Pneumonia
 - PE
1. Management of renal failure
 - AKI
 - ESRD / Dialysis
1. Logical approach to electrolyte and acid/base abnormalities 
1. Intravenous fluid do's and don'ts
1. Logical approach to inpatient fever
 - Pneumonia
 - UTI 
1. Making sure my patients survive sepsis
1. Logical approach to fluctuating cognition / neurological deficit
 - delerium
 - stroke
 - polypharmacy
1. Logical approach to: this [vital sign] is suddenly abnormal.
1. Logical approach to tachyarrythmias
 - New onset a. fib w/ or wo/ RVR

1. Management of DKA / HONK

Recently, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ruled in favor of the Broad Institute of MIT over UC Berkley in a row over the patent rights to the amazing Gene Editing Machine: CRISPR/Cas9. This is going to have consequences far and wide in terms of monetary compensation to use the technology in research, biomedical applications, medical clinical applications, agriculture, and the creation of superhumans. Okay, I’ll admit the last one is a bit of an overstatement, but there is already some research being conducted in human embryos (CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes). This dispute underscores the potential of this technology to have far-reaching consequences, and that the monetary rights conferred by patent control will be of the utmost importance.

medicine,Endotracheal Intubations during Pulm/CC fellowship,"First year fellow here. Our program is 24 months clinical and 12 months research. We don't routinely intubate at our hospital. All code blues are answered by anesthesia and often times they will come intubate in the MICU if the MICU attending isn't there such as overnight. A lot of our attendings aren't very comfortable intubating and will almost always use a glidescope. I therefore have very little DL experience. Paralytics are also not used during intubations in the MICU. If a patient can't be adequately sedated with propofol alone and needs paralytics, we have to call anesthesia.

We do have an airway rotation that is 2 weeks long every year where I go to the ORs to practice direct laryngoscopy. I am able to get about 6-8 intubations a day on these rotations so about 60-80 DLs a year and hopefully about 180-240 over the course of my fellowship. Although these are mostly skinny people with good anatomy under very controlled settings. Anesthesia won't let me touch the patients perceived to be difficult intubations.

medicine,The Future Of Surgical Practice,"I'll keep it short and simple so that we can focus primarily on the discussion rather than a million of my questions:

For those of you who are practicing general or subspecialty surgeons, would you mind providing some perspective regarding where you think your field will be in 10-20 years?  Some things that I am interested in (other students, please feel free to provide your own questions as well!):

* How much of your practice is spent doing open cases vs. minimally-invasive cases (ie, laparoscopy, VATS, endovascular, robotics)?  How can you see this changing in the future (if possible, please provide ""ballpark"" percentages; ie, open:minimally-invasive 60:40)?
* Which subspecialties can you see being replaced almost entirely by minimally-invasive approaches?
* How many (and which) of the current treatment modalities that you provide can you see being replaced (or reduced) by optimal medical management or other interventions (ie, Surgical Oncologists and Vascular Surgeons, do you see the future of pharmaceutical therapies for cancer, atherosclerosis or stroke as an issue for aspirants of your field)?

Forgive me for my ignorance; medicine is like a moving target and I'm doing my best to see which field I will be most happy with in 10-20 years.  I want my training to pay off and medicine is a very dynamic discipline with new discoveries being made every day!  Please remember to provide us with what your specialty is!  Thank you very much in advance, your responses are very helpful for medical students who are coming close to the point where we have to make our decision regarding specialty choice.",42,25,2017-02-19,PHARMA,0.036160506308078766,0.9274174571037292,0.03642194718122482

medicine,How much would a first year anesthesiology resident make in the US?,"Hey guys,

so I came across a thread about wage differences between the US and Europe. I'm German and I tried to find out how much I would make in the US, but I'm not sure if I've found the right numbers.

I have finished med school (including one year of practical training at the end) and have started working in anesthesiology about 9 months ago. I mostly work on my own, but there's always a supervisor somewhere in the background in case I run into trouble and I also get training/instruction for procedures I'm not yet familiar with. Would that be comparable to a first-year resident?

I currently make around 48,000€ a year (before taxes). Every year, I get a small raise, about 2500€. Once I finish my training (about 5 years from now), I will make 63,600€, so not all that much more. It's really a small, gradual increase with every consecutive year of training and there's no really big difference once I'm finished.

For the US, I found hugely different numbers. About $55,000 a year for residents and more than $300,000 for someone who has finished training. Is there really a six-fold increase? Are those numbers realistic? Does a first-year resident make less than someone who has almost finished training?

I would be really glad for any insight, since I'm really curious.",35,17,2017-02-20,PHARMA,0.03587204962968826,0.8747732043266296,0.08935467153787613

pharmacy,What is the pharmacy job market like?,"Hi stranger,

Maybe you're here because your wondering about the pharmacy job market.  Maybe your in undergrad, fretting about the future and thinking ""hey, pharmacy... that doesn't sound so bad.""  Maybe you're a P2, the veil is slowing lifting from your eyes and you're starting to wonder if you made the right choice.  Or maybe you're just sadistic, and you're wondering what it's looking like for pharmacists.  In order to avoid the endless and repetitive threads on the pharmacy job market, I've created the thread to end all threads.  

The links below are curated list of recent discussions regarding the job market.  The first two make a very succinct point: the job market for pharmacy is terrible.  There has been an explosion of new schools pumping out thousands of new grads a year with no increased demand for pharmacists.  Some people are graduating with $200k in debt and having trouble finding full time work.  Others are moving to the middle of nowhere to find jobs.  Landing a gig in (New York/San Fran/Boston/DC/etc) is hard and it's getting harder.  You shouldn't even *think* of going to pharmacy school if you haven't worked as a tech because you have no idea what you're getting into.

Likewise, as /u/legrange1 noted below, a study by the [National Center for Health Workforce Analysis](https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bhw/nchwa/projections/pharmacists.pdf) projects a substantial over supply of pharmacists by 2025.  This will make things harder for new grads and current pharmacists alike.

&gt; HRSA predicts by 2025 Pharmacists will have a projected oversupply of 48.9k, 16% above projected demand. Among similar healthcare professions, NPs have a projected oversupply of 42.5k, 62% above projected demand; PAs 19.7k oversupply, 66% above projected demand; CRNAs 10k oversupply, 19% above projected demand.

Please use this thread as both a place to ask questions and to post your own experience with the job market.  If you think there is a thread that should be on this list, please provide a link and the /r/pharmacy mod team will review it.  Ideally we will update this annually with the latest information.

**TL;DR:** The job market is really bad.  Do not go into pharmacy just because your parents want you to be a Doctor, but you failed the MCAT.  You will seriously regret it.

pharmacy,"Seriously, what is with MDs and Ketorolac with 99 refills!?!","Had two prescriptions today for Ketorolac both with enough refills for a year. I see this kind of thing at least once a week it seems. One doctor I called and told him I'm not refilling it because of the black box warning and he asked why. I told him to read the black box warning. He said ""I don't want to read the black box warning, I want you to tell me why."" 

So, for those of you that don't know, ketorolac is an NSAID drug that for some reason prescribers hate reading the warnings on. I want to post this to make sure everyone is aware of this issue and to prevent anyone from harming a patient.

**The black box warning for ketorolac is as follows:**

* Short term use only (up to 5 days in adults) for moderately severe acute pain requiring opioid level analgesia

* Only to be prescribed as a continuation of parenteral treatment

* Total combined duration not to exceed 5 days

* Not for minor or chronic pain

* Oral treatment not indicated in pediatric patients

* Then it goes on to list high risk of GI, cardiovascular, renal, and bleeding risks.

Ketorolac popped on my radar a couple years ago when the NFL started seeing lawsuits from players because of side effects they were experiencing. It was then looked into and it turned out that some teams were giving all their players toradol injections before every game. I'm not sure how these lawsuits turned out or if they were settled in arbitration, but here is a detailed story on the issue if you're interested: http://www.sbnation.com/2016/8/3/12310124/comfortably-numb-the-nfl-fell-in-love-with-a-painkiller-it-barely-knew

**So why do prescribers use toradol at all?**

* From what I hear, its mainly anecdotal evidence (often from patients) that it works better than other NSAIDS or is ""stronger"" than others. 

* It is also the only IM NSAID (at least in the US at the moment that I am aware of, there are some IV ones but they are more expensive and require IV access), which may be convenient in the emergency department for administering a dose to someone unable to take an oral dose due to vomiting. 

* There is also the way it was marketed when it first came out. The drug company was pushing it to be a replacement for opioids, something many providers could appreciate. They were touting its equivalence to opioids such as meperidine or morphine. This definitely had a big effect on prescribers to believe that it was the biggest advance in pain treatment at the time.

* They meant to write ""tramadol"" /s

**What does the evidence say?**

* IM vs PO Toradol (ketorolac) shows no difference in blood levels, so it isn't a more rapid onset if given IM: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1485566/pdf/cmaj00266-0036.pdf

* IM ""placebo effect"" is a myth. IE thats a bad reason to prefer ketorolac IM over anything PO: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10958124

* Oral ketorolac has been shown to provide analgesia that is the same or better than aspirin, acetaminophen, and dextropropoxyphene with acetaminophen, and equal analgesia to most other commonly available oral analgesics, including ibuprofen and acetaminophen with codeine. Intramuscular ketorolac provides analgesia equivalent to commonly used doses of meperidine and morphine. http://www.jem-journal.com/article/0736-4679(95)02052-7/abstract

**Why should I care?**

Well ignoring a black boxed warning like this is a bad idea. I found an article on a great pharmacy law blog that explains it in more detail (https://petercohronrxlaw.com/2014/07/23/when-there-is-no-law/) but basically it is an open and shut case if a patient were to be harmed by this AND your liability insurance may not defend you for ignoring a black boxed warning. 

A post a while back from an expert witness on the topic: http://i.imgur.com/45a1Row.png

Since the evidence has established that a) ketorolac is NOT more effective than other NSAIDS and b) it IS more dangerous, there is almost no excuse for willingly disregarding a black boxed warning like this and you could end up in major legal and financial trouble if you were to do so.

medicine,[meta] /r/medicine mods are looking for subreddit feedback.,"/r/medicine mods are looking for any feedback or recommendations to help keep this subreddit a high quality community. Specifically, we’re looking for community input on the subreddit rules and enforcement, as well as for suggestions for improvement about the content or moderation of the subreddit. We’d like to know what you like most and least about /r/medicine, what you’d like to see changed, and how you think we ought to do that.

A couple things that have come up since [the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/4s0pne/meta_rmedicine_mods_are_looking_for_subreddit/):

1. The elephant in the room is recent developments in politics and submissions related to these developments internationally. Putting aside your political leanings, should /r/medicine allow submissions that are related to politics? What's the line between a submission that's mostly political and a submission that's mostly medical? What's /r/medicine's opinion on this, and is that opinion limited to US politics? If you can, please provide recent examples to support what you'd consider a valuable (or not) submission to the subreddit. Bear in mind examples in recent memory besides the obvious include the British junior doctor contract strikes, the Latin American doctors falling asleep, etc.

1. We're continuing to remove threads related to careers and specialties, but have started a weekly Thursday '[Careers Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/5vptte/weekly_careers_thread_february_23_2017/)' to allow this community to help medical professionals by sharing experiences and wisdom. We hope this is a generally acceptable change but we're open to feedback, of course.

1. The moderation team made a deliberate decision to remain part of /r/popular when it was launched eight days ago. Anecdotally, we're seeing a lot more posts from laypeople as a result of this and an increase in low-quality submissions that tend to get trapped in the modqueue before becoming visible to the general subreddit, though some slip do through. Please do continue to report submissions that you think are in violation of the rules as it helps us out a lot. For the curious, the week before /r/popular was introduced, the moderation team removed 168 posts. In the seven days following introduction, we removed 235 posts.

I'm happy to hear your thoughts on the above points or any that you'd like to bring up - this post will remain stickied for at least a week and we'll try to reply to as much as we can. It would be particularly helpful if any suggestions, if possible, were accompanied by a link to a submission or a comment that illustrates the issue.

Please bear in mind that this is a community of over 84,000 people and this subreddit is moderated by a few volunteers with day (and night) jobs. Proposed changes should be both philosophically and practically acceptable and should take into consideration this subreddit’s target audience of medical professionals.

Thanks,

medicine,How to avoid getting pages in the middle of the night,"I've seen this come up fairly frequently in the last few weeks in Meddit, and while I know that this might be a controversial post, I think I can offer some advice that will, depending on your facility, reduce the amount of random-ass pages you all seem to be getting from nurses in the middle of the night. Personally, on our unit, we only call between the hours of 12am and 6am if a patient is doing poorly, and we will check amongst ourselves to see whether it's appropriate to wake you up. Not because we like you (although we usually do!) but because it's not safe.

- Call us/visit us about an hour you go to sleep. ""Does anyone have anything for the Medicine team? Any patients you are worried about or orders that need to be cosigned or bullshit paperwork?"" Then maybe you could say something like ""I will be back at 6am before handover to go over any non-urgent issues that came up overnight."" 

- Make sure your patients have at least one (preferably more than one) PRN pain medicine, and a sleep aid (if appropriate). And something for agitation/withdrawal (again, if appropriate). 

- Set parameters on your VS/telemetry etc. ""Call MD if HR &lt; 50"" so someone doesn't decide to call you about a stable HR of 55. ""Call if UO is &lt;200mls in a 12 hour period."" Write an order that says ""Bladder scan q6, if PVR &gt;400mls, do I/O catheter x 1"" if we mention that someone hasn't peed in a while.

-How often are we checking your patients' VS? If we are checking it Q4 on a stable patient, you might be called about something at 12am that could probably wait until morning. Of course, you'd need to trust that the nurse recognizes when a patient LOOKS bad and might need an additional set of VS taken.

Any other random things you're paged about?",151,255,2017-02-25,PHARMA,0.07798954099416733,0.8930864930152893,0.02892399951815605

medicine,What are the rules of thumb for a leukemic patient's white count as they go through treatment and relapse or remission?,"I'm a lab tech in a hospital small enough that I see the same patient's bloods repeatedly and can see the changes, in both raw values and in their diffs. What I don't see is the story behind their blood, and I'm very curious. I have the theory, I can see the main diagnosis if it shows in that one line in the lab screen (it doesn't always show their cancer, we usually remember them once we put the slide on the scope), and I can/should/it's part of my job to check previous values on any critical or delta numbers. What I would love to know more about is what it looks like as a clinical picture. A patient who's a new diagnosis and crawling with blasts, that is pretty clear, and we assume people with white counts through the floor are having chemo. But pretty much anything else is a mystery, like patient Jones this week with a climbing white count, or patient Smith who is inpatient with a white count that should be normal soon. Are they getting better, did they have an infection, are they on chemo? (for those not in the US, it's illegal for me to look at any info related to the patient which I do not need for my job, and highly illegal to track a patient. If Jones comes in for draws on Wednesdays and I haven't been on cbcs on Wednesdays for a month then that patient essentially dissappears.)

Do you know of any good, simple explanations of what changes happen and what they mean from the doctor/patient/clinical side? I know the biology, identifying features and the cells, but I don't know the clinical picture or what happens over time.

I have to suffix this by saying that previously to working on the floor/ER k would get sick once every 2 to 3 years once, and never as bad as it gets now. I am just wondering if any of you guys experience or have experienced something similar. My friend who graduated with me and is working in another hospital is experiencing something similar but it is not as bad as I am having it.  

Also I think I must add, I always ALWAYS wash my hands and clean them with alcohol when I go from patient to patient. I am not an animal okay?

medicine,Primitive camping: suture/first aid kit,"So I've always enjoyed camping and recently I've made some new friends that are into really primitive camping (though we will car camp if we have a larger group). I'm off tomorrow so my plan is to start assembling a good, compact kit to take with us. I have a few specific questions for anyone who is interested in similar things, has made a kit, or has experience/training in wilderness medicine. (I hope to do wilderness CME later this year but we want to camp again before it gets too hot).

1. **Suturing**: is this a reasonable idea in the field? Obviously I'm not going to get a sterile field, but most minor lacerations can be sutured in a ""clean"" field without increased infection risk. The question is whether a ""clean"" field is feasible, or whether I should just pack steri-strips and plan to leave the site if the strips aren't enough. (I know this answer will depend on the duration of the hike, i.e. if we plan to be out 3-4 days and a long distance from a clinic it's more practical to do a suture in the field).

2. **Betadine vs. hydrogen peroxide**: which is better antiseptic for field? If I had my choice I would go with H2O2 because it's more versatile and doesn't stain clothing. However I'm honestly not sure of the effectiveness for infection prevention. I'm also aware that sterile saline is fine for cleaning minor wounds in a pinch.

3. **Splinting**: How much splinting should I bring and what type? I'd imagine I can make a decent splint by bringing bandaging/tape and finding the right pieces of wood. But is there any specific material that is compact enough to justify  bringing along, rather than scavenging for the support materials?

Planned kit so far: ACE bandage, cloth/athletic tape, antiseptic (betadine/H2O2), saline (100-200cc), hemostats/forceps (versatile for sutures, foreign body, etc), splinting material (vs. finding materials in the field), suture kit? (4-0 nonabsorb, needle drivers, 20cc syringe w/ angiocath for irrigation, lidocaine pre-filled)

This is early spitballing so any and all suggestions are appreciated! 

**EDIT**: Thanks for all the suggestions! We have the best suggestions, don't we folks? As usual, something else came up so I won't be kit-building today. But soon! I'll try to post the kit when I get it finished. 

The consensus seems to be that unless I'm really going out in the bush for a while or avoiding apocalypse I shouldn't plan for suturing. Glue is the best bet for weight and ease of use, but steristrips and/or duct tape are a good alternative (and duct tape is multi-use). As mentioned, hemostasis would be the only reason for suturing and most of the time we'd be leaving the field for something that extensive.

I'll look into SAM splints (thanks to u/JimJimkerson and u/evilqueenofnumbers, as well as others for bringing them up)

There are a lot of opinions about cleansing/antiseptic so I will probably go with small amounts of betadine/h2o2 and see which one ends up being more versatile. Or drop both of them in lieu of clean water, my only concern being that if a water source is a long distance I might need that water more for cooking/drinking.",40,29,2017-02-26,PHARMA,0.03745310381054878,0.9222093224525452,0.04033752158284187

v  I’m only a few minutes late. I don’t even need long with the doctor.

v  Can’t you just squeeze me in?

v  It will literally only take a couple of minutes.

v  It’s not my fault I’m late.

v  If you had given me better directions to the office, I wouldn’t be late.

v  Oh my god, don’t tell me I’m late. I had a nightmare getting here!

v  I am just sick of this cold, I want to get rid of it.

v  I never go to the doctor usually. Actually I have a few things to ask you about now that I’m here.

v  My co-worker/manager insisted I come to see you (about this minor issue not visible to the naked eye).

v  I don’t feel right. I can’t be more specific. Can you do some tests?

v  I know my body, and something isn’t right. When I was younger I never felt like this.

v  I don’t think this is lifestyle-related, I think it’s rude to ask me about that. Next time I’d prefer to see another doctor.

v  I thought I should have a full blood count/colonoscopy/body scan/MRI…just for peace of mind.

v  Hayfever season just started and I have all the symptoms of hayfever but I definitely don’t have hayfever.

v  I was drinking heavily last night but that has no bearing whatsoever on my condition today which coincidentally has the same symptoms as a hangover.

v  I brought my children along, that’s absolutely fine isn’t it? I have troubling symptoms. Ssh darling, Mummy is talking to the doctor.

v  I don’t have an appointment so I thought I’d pop in to see if anyone could see me NOW? I was just passing.

v  I have an potentially alarming symptom which I never had before, what do you mean, the records say I have had it many times before?

v  How long have you been practising medicine?

v  The last doctor I saw didn’t seem to want to give me any medication.

v  The last doctor I saw didn’t want to give me high-strength drugs, but I was hoping you could give me some of the “good stuff!” I just want to get sorted out, you know, and get well! That’s reasonable isn’t it?

v  The last doctor I saw didn’t have any suggestions for me so I was hoping you could help (notes have long list of suggestions).

v  I saw somebody a few days ago but there’s been no improvement, so here I am back! (for a viral infection)

v   “Yeah, I know! That is so funny. And you know…oh, hang on. They want something. Oh, I’ve got to go, the doctor is calling me through! Yeah, I’m at the doctors office! Oh I’m alright, just something I need to ask them about…I’ll tell you later…oh, I should go. Yes, the doctor is calling me through! Yeah, see you later! Oh, I’ll survive! OK, ‘bye….yes, I’ll tell you later!” (patient hangs up phone).

v  You look very young to be a doctor.

v  Goodbye – bet that was the easiest/quickest consultation you ever had!

medicine,What do you tell patients about tests you order on them?,"I'm a phlebotomist at a fairly busy hospital, and last night I was drawing labs on a charming gentleman when we had this exchange:

Patient: So what are these labs for?

Me: Well this one is a renal panel, it's looking at how your kidneys are doing, this one is an HIV scree-

Patient: HIV YOU MEAN LIKE AIDS I DON'T F**** HAVE AIDS WHY THE F*** ARE YOU SAYING I HAVE AIDS

etc

which got me wondering, do y'all usually tell patients what tests you're running on them? My job description includes explaining routine tests in generalities to patients if they ask, but when it's something specific and possibly sensitive, what would be best to say? Like I already pretend that I don't know that CA19-9 or alpha fetoprotein are tumor markers, I'll just say the name of the test and that they should talk to someone on their care team with questions. But for an HIV test it's in the name, so... Do they usually know about the workup, and this guy was just being ridiculous, or is that kind of thing often a surprise?",81,143,2017-02-28,PHARMA,0.06501460075378418,0.9113622903823853,0.023623038083314896
