""Well, I've never been in the movies, just on TV, and I'm the former Miss [State], and 195[X] Miss America.""

medicine,"How can I teach my family members the importance of empirical scientific research in medicine, and help them see most forms of alternative medicine for what they are: quackery?","About 3 years ago my oldest brother began having a strong interest in alternative medicines. More specifically, he was very interested in acupuncture, and herbal medicine, both part of Traditional Chinese Medicinal practices (TCM). About 2 years ago, he enrolled in the Five Branches Institute in Santa Cruz, CA. You can google it; its a large ""university"" that teaches TCM and apparently (according to my brother) western scientific doctrine as well (basic chemistry, some anatomy, etc). He will finish in a year and will be licensed to open his own practice and treat people using TCM, mostly acupuncture and herbal medicine.

I'm not too concerned about him, because he is so stuck in his new-age ideology and I know he will probably make a decent income based off of his practice. I know there is almost no way I can penetrate his defense mechanisms in order for him to increase his scientific literacy. I know the people he surrounds himself with and they all share these new-age beliefs (disbelief in scientific integrity, just see the wikipedia page for ""new-age"" to know what I'm talking about)

However, I am concerned about my family members, who are increasingly spending money at this institute to receive ""treatments"" such as acupuncture treatments, and herbal remedies. 

My mother was experiencing some negative symptoms of menopause about a year ago. After my brother's recommendation, she went to see one of the 'doctor's at his institute, the Five Branches place, and they prescribed her this nasty concoction of herbs that she would mix, cook, and drink daily. (it was very expensive)
The result was that her symptoms were apparently relieved (or some of them), or so she believed. After this confirmation, she, as well as my father, began to use their services more and more. More recently, my father used some herbal remedy to 'overcome his seasonal pollen allergy symptoms'. However, I also share the same allergic responses, and my symptoms fluctuate a great deal from day to day, so I'm not convinced that the herbs are what caused his symptoms to die down within a matter of days.

My question is this: **How can I (or should I?) go about explaining to them why they should avoid using these 'remedies' and treatments.** I could go about explaining to them that they are likely reinforced by the placebo effect, and that little to no scientific/medical research has been done on the efficacy of any of the methods (except for acupuncture, which has shown that is equivalent to a placebo)... but I don't believe this will persuade them to stop using them.

**TLDR:** My family is using alternative medicines, and I think it is a waste of their time and money. The trend I'm seeing is worrying because it is the gradual acceptance of what was once believed to be quackery in medicine.",8,4,2011-06-03,PHARMA,0.0566939152777195,0.9150927066802979,0.02821338176727295

Health,Having an asthma flare up - Inhaler NOT working,"A few days ago, I ran out of my Singulair and Advair. As usual, I forget to get new stuff until I'm actually out of it. So I was without my medication for a few days. Usually this isn't anything, but lately my asthma has been bad all day long for several days, and the inhaler only lasted 2-4 hours before I'd need to take it again, which is not normal.

Today, my inhaler is practically useless. It provides acute relief for 20-30 minutes or so, but then the symptoms return. I've probably taken about 20 puffs today.

Recently, the weather has changed and has been a bit hot and humid. But it was a bit cooler today and yesterday so I'm not so sure if that was the cause. I've been eating a high-protein diet to accompany my lifting program, but I've been doing that for around a month without problems. I lifted a bit today which provided slight relief. The nebulizer didn't do much either.

**What can I do to relieve my symptoms other than medication?** For now at least, until I get to the doctor tomorrow if it's still bad. I've been doing some Buteyko breathing exercises which is helpful to an extent. What else is there to do?

I just hate taking these medications. I'm a healthy, active guy, but I am absolutely terrified of what the side effects must be in the future. Steroids are bad, I know that much.

Health,What would cause an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep during the day?,"Background info: I'm a 27 year old computer programmer with an average weight. Currently my diet isn't the greatest, but I attempt to eat well. Typically get 6 to 8 hours of sleep a night. Normally drink one cup of coffee in the morning before work and smoke 7 - 10 cigarettes a day. I've been taking Adderall under a doctor's supervision for the past six months[first daily prescribed medication in my life] to treat adult ADHD, but the symptoms began occurring several years ago. When they began appearing, I started to change my lifestyle and habits gradually in order to deduce what the problem was. First I stopped drinking coffee at work during the day, then changed my diet to cut out any sort of excessive carbohydrates and sugar and included plenty of greens, fruits, and lean protein. Then after that still didn't work, I changed how I ate at work by eating 3 or 4 mini meals while working (ate an apple around 11, tuna salad with crackers at one, then a protein bar around 3). This helped, but still didn't elimanate the sleepiness. So I began excersizing for 20 - 30 minutes in the morning 4 days a week before work. This helped alot more, but still I felt an uncontrollable need to take a nap at work. Finally, and this is the only thing that eliminated the symptoms completely, I switched when I excersized to the evening and increased the duration to about an hour and half to two hours (running/biking, weight training, stretching). I enjoy excersizing alot, but the time it took to excersize each day so that I didn't want to sleep while working began affecting my personal life, hobbies, and relationships with friends and family. Recently, my lifestlye has slid a bit and no longer exercise as much as I used to. While at work, I get up every hour or two, stretch and walk around for a couple minutes and this helps also, but doesn't solve the problem. No history of depression (other than normal teenage angst when I was younger) but friends have mentioned I'm more anxious than the average person, but I don't believe it's enough for me to warrant seeing a doctor and is something I'm able to reason through. Normally a pretty well-adjusted and happy person and have a sense of purpose. Whew, that was alot of background, but just wanted to make sure I covered all the bases...

So, while at work I sit most of the day in front of a computer, programming. Typically eat a light lunch and snack all day on fruit or nuts (not an extreme amount of snacking, just enough to keep hunger from being a distraction) and maybe a granola or protein bar. But everyday around 2 or 3 pm, I get an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep. It's like my body is saying ""go the fuck to sleep"" but my mind is like ""you can't go to sleep now, you're working, stay awake!"". No matter how hard I attempt to stop it from happening, I wind up taking like micronaps which is a really strange sensation. I'll be in the middle of trying to solve a problem and all of a sudden I'll 'snap out of it' and realize I'd essentially been sleeping for maybe 2 seconds. I can sense when this is about to occur, I begin to really drowsy and eventually it devolves to the point of these micronaps that continue at pretty high frequency for the next hour or so. Finally I'll come out of that fog and still feel drowsy, but at least not ""micronapping"". I enjoy my work and am passionate about it, so I'm typically not bored while at work. Since beginning to take Adderall on a daily basis, the symptoms stopped occurring for maybe a month, but have only gone away once since starting the medication and that was when my doctor upped my dosage and the symptoms eventually came back.

It really is a pain in the ass and I don't know what to do, other than excersize 2 hours a day, which cuts into time I'd rather be practicing my instrument, hanging with friends, or reading. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Also, if anyone out there has experienced anything similar, if you would describe it and what steps you took to fix it, that would be awesome also.

What triggers it?

Share stories!

For me it started in college, the trigger was I had to give a public speech, had bad anxiety about it and realized I had to go to the toilet immediately. Since then a lot of the things that are pretty normal are a hassle for me - driving around through a new city (no sure way of knowing where toilets are), any kind of travelling (especially in buses, trams...), going to clubs, whatever... there's always that nagging thought an attack might happen. I can't really eat what I want, especially if we go out to a restaurant I'll always take something pretty bland so I don't have an attack.

Throughout the years it has made my life pretty miserable/depressing. I did find something that helped with the spasms (Aloe Vera pills supposedly made without the laxative ingredient) and it has made day to day life much easier. I went from having watery stool a couple of times per day to a somewhat loose stool to a somewhat loose stool once or twice per day.

Btw. I am self-diagnosed and am preparing to go to the doctor for the ultrasound, colonoscopy etc just to be sure. I did talk with a doctor and he said that judging by the symptoms it's IBS but he has to make the test to be sure.

So, let's hear what you fellow IBSers are going through!",95,10,2011-06-06,PHARMA,0.0714433342218399,0.8952236175537109,0.03333298861980438

The punch I barely even felt because of adrenaline and drunkenness but the bite left a circular and slightly bloody bite mark that I went and washed with water and window cleaner (it was the closest thing to soap that they had in the house).

Health,Does the fructose contained in fruit cause the same problems as eating normal sugar or HFCS?,"Dr. Robert Lustig asserts that any kind of sugar is basically poison: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM

But I've read elsewhere that we can eat fruit safely and not worry about blood sugar problems.  I've also heard advice stating that the only way to maintain a healthy diet is to cut out all sources of sugar (including fruit).  Searches on the internet yield the same sampling of conflicting opinions.  Can anyone link some definitive articles or cite sound reasoning one way or the other?  

EDIT: thanks for the responses guys.  A lot of you point out that the video discusses fruit.  But the amount of fructose in certain fruits does not seem to be offset by the relatively little fiber.  Fruits vary wildly from fatty avacado to sweet pineapple.  Surely not all are as safe to eat as others.  Lustig does not distinguish here or give any further guidance.

Health,"Have a spinal problem, need someone to talk to","I don't know if this is the best place to do this, but it's been building inside me for years.

I'm 24 and I have scoliosis.  For those that don't know, it's a curvature of the spine.  I was diagnosed with it when I was in junior high, and have been kind of lost ever since.

I'm in pain every day, not severe, but enough to have my struggles.  Standing up for long periods of time hurts - I have to tense my muscles constantly to hold myself up straight because my spine doesn't do it for me.  This causes me to get fatigued quicker than most, and if I stand too long I can start to get dizzy or lose the ability to focus because I've been tensing my muscles for so long.  I'm always leaning on something when I can.  When sitting, I have to have arm rests to hold myself up straight otherwise my spine wants to force me to lean forward.

I know this sounds like complaining, and that's because it is.  I don't know any of you, and I keep this bottled up in my daily life.  I don't ask for pity, and I don't tell anyone I have a problem, because the truth of it is there are people out there a lot worse off than myself.  I'm a construction worker and very much a 'suck it up' kind of person.  I just need a place to get my thoughts out there, and maybe get some advice in doing so.  My apologies if it comes off as pandering.

Aside from the physical side of things, my biggest struggles are with the psychological effects.  I very much feel like I'm deformed, and it's a constant struggle to consciously make myself appear normal - atleast as normal as I can.  Every waking moment that I'm around any human being I'm tensed, thinking about whether or not I'm standing up straight, trying to find a mirror to check my posture in, etc.  I just feel exhausted and I don't want to live like this anymore.  

The bad thing is - my problem also affects others perception of me.  I'm a hard worker, but I have the appearance of someone who's lazy.  I look like a sloucher or a slacker, and it comes across in how people treat me all the time.  I won't go into specifics, but I've come across it enough to identify how I'm perceived.  It's a strange thing to do the same work as someone else and be treated differently because of how you look. 

I don't know if the gravity of my feelings really comes through in my words, but I'm really looking for any advice or help reddit might have here.

Health,Are there any TMJ treatments that actually work?,"I've been experiencing TMJ issues for about 2 years now (which can cause some pretty nasty headaches), and found out one of the meds I'm on for another condition was making me clench my jaw in my sleep (I've since lowered the dose and my TMJ issues improved).

My dentist then recommended I have my wisdom teeth removed, which actually seemed to make my TMJ worse, and so then I was told to wear my retainers from when I had braces. They worked for a few months, but now I'm wearing through my retainers, my TMJ issues are back, and my dentist wants to fit me for a night-guard (which my insurance doesn't cover and I will have to pay out of pocket for).

I've researched TMJ online, and I've tried all of the exercises, stretches, and other supposed treatments (including supplements and diet). I've come across some horror stories about surgery, and read just as many articles for night-guards, as I have against. At this point I'm not sure what to try, or what kind of doctor to see. I'm considering canceling my appointment with my dentist, and making an appointment with a TMJ specialist (which will likely have to be out of pocket as well). If I'm going to spend $500, I'd rather spend it on something that will actually help.

Any suggestions? Advice? Anyone actually find a solution that works?

So far I've tried: Jaw exercises, retainers, yoga, trigger points, supplements, anti-inflamitory diet, contour pillows, removed my wisdom teeth, and drugs (pain killers, anti-inflamtories, muscle relaxers, hypnotics - the muscle relaxers and hypnotics work the best, anti-inflamtories are hit or miss, and usually can't get a doctor to give me a continual script for any of these drugs).

TLDR: TMJ issues, tried retainers, removed wisdom teeth, still having issues / getting really bad headaches. Not sure what method of treatment to pursue?

Update: Made an appointment with a new dentist who is also a surgeon (not planning on surgery, and he only does it if everything else fails). Even if he just recommends a nightguard I'd rather have someone who knows what they're doing create it, rather then my dentist who I get the feeling doesn't know what shes doing.",18,5,2011-06-09,PHARMA,0.14134584367275238,0.8302608132362366,0.02839341200888157

Health,Is Bromelain safe to take pre surgery?,"On the 20th of this month I'm having surgery(for facial paralysis on one side) done by a plastic surgeon. I received a list of medications I shouldn't be taking, with a couple medications that I should take. It's a fairly standard list, with aspirin, ibuprofen, alcohol, etc.. on it. My problem is with the two things I should take 5-7 days before surgery. one of them is Arncia Montana, which is a homeopathic medicine. Obviously I am not getting that one. The other is [Bromelain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromelain), a plant extract from pineapple. Researching Bromelain, It seems like it might have some medical use for healing wounds after a surgery. After I picked it up at some GNC store, I was reading the bottle and under 'WARNING' it states : Discontinue use prior to surgery. Some more researching, and I found out that it is a anti-coagulant. Reading both papers about what to take/discontinue prior to surgery, there seems to be a contradiction.  

I guess  I actually have two questions.  With questionable and homeopathic medicines recommended to me, It's giving me some doubt about this doctors other decisions. But after looking at other plastic surgery websites, those two substances seem fairly commonly advocated. Maybe they are standard teaching in plastic surgery courses or that paper I got was a generic surgery one that is out of date. Some advice/feedback would be gladly accepted.

Health,"Hey, r/Health! Need help to quit smoking","So, I've been a smoker for the past 3 years, and have been meaning to quit smoking for the past 3 months. 

I switched from smoking Marlboros, Camels, to smoking strictly all natural, additive free tobacco, Nat Sherman brand cigarettes.

I was hoping to gradually ween my self off the habit by smoking less of the amount that I'd smoke on a day-to-day basis. I've gone from smoking 2-3 packs every two days, to smoking 10 cigarettes a day. 

The change from the normal intake to something drastically less was terrible, the withdrawals from it were just AWFUL. I tried quitting completely cold turkey, but that I could *not* handle.

Right now, since my consumption of cigs are way less, I find it easier to hold my self off from smoking even when I have a craving (however I still succumb and go out to do it anyway, but I can withhold my self from doing it for a long period of time).

I was wondering, smokers of r/Health, what have you done to successfully quit smoking? Did you go cold turkey, did you do what I'm doing? did you do any activities to keep your mind off of smoking, if so, what?

Health,Need advice remedying my recent Gastritis/Stomach thingy.,"Hey r/health, hope this is a proper place to ask advice on this issue.

I've recently been going through a rough time dealing with a number of coinciding pains/ills/health concerns. The one most urgent being my stomach recently having a very painful time digesting foods I've eaten without problem for as long as I can remember.

I went to a low income clinic recently and they diagnosed me with Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which sounds fancy, but my impression is that my stomach lining is worn out/inflamed/torn/breached - something along these lines.

Symptoms are severe pain and discomfort after eating hearty foods or drinking only one beer. My bowel movements have been more sparse, and I've have copious amounts of gas. And this all has arisen in the last few days or more. I've experienced a similar episode like this a while back but much less severe and did not last.

What I'm hoping to find out is how I can tune my diet to be conducive of optimally healing and regeneration of the stomach and digestive tract, including food type, portions, time intervals and regiments. So far I've been prescribed ranitidine (ZANTAC) but decided to go with a local nutritionists advice of taking chewable Licorice extract (Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice Root Extract). I've stopped smoking and stopped drinking in the mean time.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and for your consideration. I really need to sort this out for many reasons. I have other health concerns that need addressing, I'm broke as fuck and can barely pay the bills right now and need to be able to work proficiently soon, and I just found a really nice girl with lots of energy that I want to be able to keep up with and perform well in other areas.

Health,Started eating less calories and I get hypoglycemia symptoms all of a sudden.,"Hello,

I will go to my family doctor with this in two weeks, I'm not home right now, I just want to get some opinions from r/health.

For a couple of months I was on a low carb diet, I didn't really care for it, didn't give the results I wanted so I switched to counting calories. I'm 173 cm, I weight 86 kg and I try keeping my daily calorie intake somewhere around 2000 calories, this started last Monday. For the past week I had episodes of significant anxiety, couldn't sleep so well, tired and some times I'd just get a bit light headed, dizzy, nausea. I had none of these symptoms before, not even while I was on the low carb diet.

After some googleing I read about hypoglycemia and the symptoms it has and they seemed to fit very well with what I'm going through. I took a tablespoon of honey during my last episode of dizziness and the symptoms went away so I am pretty confident I suffer from this. Plus my father had type 2 diabetes so I probably inherited some insulin problems from him, maybe I even have diabetes although I don't really seem to have the symptoms of diabetes at this point, but I will definitely get tested.

For the last week I usually ate a variety of things, for example today I ate a sandwich, eggs, vegetables, chicken breast, biscuits.. I am very confused why hyoglycemia was triggered at this point.

Why did this occur when I'm counting calories and not when I was on the low carb diet? Should I go back to the low carb diet until I go to the doctor in two weeks?

Health,Have trouble losing weight.,"I'm guessing this is the best place to ask this. So here is the back story. Me and my girlfriend live together. We both work from home. We usually eat between 1300 to 2000 calories a day. And it's usually towards the 1500 on the average. We really don't get much exercise. Now, I'm 6foot2 and weigh 160lbs, she is 5foot2 and weighs about 300lbs. From everything I have read, even with no exercise, she should be losing almost a pound a day with that diet. It's mostly home cooked good quality foods, low in carbs. She even drinks water, I drink pop with every meal.

When she tried going on a diet, she was eating around 1000 calories a day. I was with her the whole time and she wasn't sneaking out to snack. She lost 5lbs throughout the course of five months. And she was doing yoga for an hour four times a week.

Do you guys think that maybe she has some sort of metabolism problem? Exercise is out of the question, so no comments about that please. Is this normal for someone of her weight and calorie intake to gain weight instead of lose?

Health,"The girl I've started dating just told me she has genital herpes. I need some help, reddit.","I've only been on two dates with this girl so far, and she is spectacular. I mean on a real level, I can see this one going the distance. At the end of the date, she works up the courage to tell me she has an STD; more specifically, she tells me she has herpes (presumably HSV-2). My honest reaction was that I didn't want that to decide whether or not we were right for each other, and that I wanted a third date regardless. 

However, I do have to look out for my own health and safety. I realize I can't be having sex with her all willy-nilly, I have to be smart and take precautions. I perused many web sites and texts to learn more about the disease to protect myself, and some made me very scared. For example, reading that it can be spread just through kissing (which I'm not sure is 100% factual), that many infected people don't even show symptoms, etc.

I really like this girl. Not only is she physically attractive, but her personality is a rare find. Let's be real here, though, I'm only human and I do want to engage in sexual activity (preferably with her, of course). If anyone out there on reddit has herpes or is with someone who has herpes, please give me your best advice on how to make this relationship work. Is oral sex out of the question (and I mean both ways, her to me and me to her)? Do condoms really provide adequate protection?

I appreciate any insight and honesty. Thank you.

So: what insurance company would take me on? I would guess none. There are some welfare programs I have looked into but I have been rejected because I just started a new job. I will have insurance from my new job but not will not take effect till October. I mostly concerned about IF surgery has to happen, how would I pay for it.

Health,"Severe dehydration.  PLEASE help.  Was in hospital yesterday.  Visiting foreign country, can not tell if I am getting better","hello, I am working in India.  Long story but I ended up falling very very ill to the point I could not walk because I had no balance (would fall into wall even walking one step).  Full body pain, terrible pain.  Someone came and got me to doctor.  Doctor said I was severe dehydrated, blood pressure was dangerously low and I was sweating too much, to go to emergency room and stay in hospital 2 days getting IV fluids.


Took rickshaw to hospital, they put me on IV drip, then 4 hours later said ok go home.  What could I do they needed the bed.  Got back and have medicine.  Today I can walk, but my head is so pain that when I move the bottom of my head and neck just feels like someone is twisting it off.  Plus all day my eyes are super super dialated.  I have terrible diarea as well (sorry that is gross) so i am loosing a lot of fluids that way


I am supposed to take a long train ride.  Please if there is someone with medical experience, how do I know when I am getting better?  I am worried for my health and worried that even if I'm getting better I'm just maybe maintaining minimum and will just become dehydrated again.  How will I know?  Dr. said 2 days hospital, hospital said I was fine.  I am at a loss here because I don't speak the language.  


Should I go back to hospital, how do I know when I am getting to that emergency stage again.  I can walk now but right now honestly since I fell sick its that high feeling kind of where you look to the side but say your eyes don't catch up with you for a second?  I don't know how to explain.  I am in a haze.  The dialated pupils scares me.  Is that normal.  There is no AC anywhere so here I only have fans.  It is hot here


EDIT:  yesterday after coming home from hospital there was a cou[ple moments where I felt y throat kind of I'm not sure closing up, almost like having an asthma attack.  Not sure how to describe because I get heart palpitations and this sounds weird but I could not entirely figure out if it was my heart or my throat.  It is extremily difficult for me to get back to doctor or hospital because it involves walking and that is extreme difficulty for me so thats why I want to keep it only if I have to go back",33,21,2011-06-24,PHARMA,0.07443200796842575,0.8890331983566284,0.03653476759791374

It's been there for going on 3 years now about halfway down my inner right thigh. It developed to full size (about the size of half a dime) within the first few weeks and has stayed the same since then. No pain. Some discomfort when I twist my leg in tight jeans.

A nurse practitioner told me it was a staph infection (two years ago) and to bring it to a head with heat and that it would burst to expel the infected pus. No amount of heat ever did that.

It feels solid, like a small, irregularly-shaped mass. You can see the redness around it.

I have never had anything else like it and currently don't have medical insurance (and probably won't for another year). I've tried poking into it with a sterilized needle a few different times, hoping to pop it but the needle never breaks skin, no matter how hard I press. It just pushes the ""mass"" into my thigh.

----------------------------

**Could this be a staph infection? After this long with no change in size? Or some kind of benign cyst? Any way I can remedy this at home?**

Health,Need help staying calm,"Hello reddit.
I have huge final exams in a couple of days, and I kind of need help on staying calm and focused during them. I am really nervous about them, and my problem with this is that when I get nervous i need to pee. Like, really really need to pee. And the problem is that we're not allowed to exit the room to go pee during the test, not without some sort of medical condition...The exams take 2 and a half hours each, and I'm really nervous as to if I can hold that long without going to the bathroom.

Maybe this sounds silly, and I know it's ""all in my head"". If I am at home doing nothing I can be 10 hours without peeing, but not on school because I get nervous.

So if anyone can give me some sort of tip on how to stay calm and focus on my test, I'd really appreciate it, because I'm scared that I panic.

It is well known that stress is bad for human health. Is it possible the opposite is also true? Is it possible that part of the equation to being healthy, vibrant, and strong is just to consistently **FEEL** healthy, vibrant, and strong? After watching the video I meditated on these feelings and I can honestly say after less than a minute of this I felt more alert, vibrant, and had a great sense of wellbeing that literally brought a smile to my face - right now I feel better than I have almost all day. Is this just a basic emotional response? Does my body know something I don't? Or is this just the placebo effect I am feeling?

Edit: I know this sounds new agey and all but I encourage you guys to at least attempt this for a moment. After all, we as a species are still learning what *really* works and who we should trust.

pharmacy,Advice for a pre-pharmacy student looking for a pharmacy tech job.,"I'm a recent college grad who plans on going into pharmacy school. But because I'm passed due with registration, I have to wait for the next cycle. In between studying for the PCATs and volunteering at the hospital, I figured getting a job as a pharmacy tech would look good on my resume.  However, even though I'm certified, I've been having difficulty finding a job. Most mail-order pharmacy look for 1-2 years of real-life pharmacy experience, which I don't have. I've also had little luck with in-patient pharmacies at hospitals. My only chance, I figured, are retail chains (where most of my friends got their start), however because of the summer session, it seems that they've slowed down the hiring process. I know it's only been a month, but I'm just itching for a pharm tech job (not just for money and experience, but for a recommendation as well). I know there's some luck involved, but is there anything else I should be doing in order to increase my chances? Should I lie about my experience (I've been volunteering at a hospital pharmacy for close to 3 years now, but apparently that's not considered real-life pharmacy experience)? I was also told not to tell my employer that I plan on going to pharmacy school, is that something I should do?",15,6,2011-06-30,PHARMA,0.02836974710226059,0.9233639240264893,0.04826631024479866
