medicine,Frustrating encounters with outpatient docs who prescribe expensive meds without considering cost.,"I'll preface this with the fact that I'm a PICU NP. I don't do outpatient, and I could be better about considering costs when discussing medications or therapies, but often my patients are so sick there aren't really alternatives.  I know healthcare costs are a big point of discussion in this group. I got a phone call from my sister (26 years old, no PMH/PSH, very healthy), crying because she's had this mild persistent stomach pain with textbook GERD/chronic gastritis symptoms (very likely gastritis from NSAID/stress) for a while and finally went to a doc about it. 

This doc told her she needed an ultrasound, labs, *colonoscopy and endoscopy* to rule out stomach cancer (?!) and also here take this super fancy PPI (dexlansoprazole). She called me because she has basically no disposable income to pay for the copays on these things, and her PPI was going to cost her $200/mo out of pocket. 

In contrast, when I went to my own PCP with my stress induced chronic gastritis, he tested me for H pylori, did some routine labs, then put me on omeprazole for a month and tapered off. Boom, fixed. 

It was so frustrating that this doc had scared her into thinking that she needed all these invasive tests prior to even trialing any kind of medication. And prescribed her something expensive. If I hadn't been there to recommend something else she just wouldn't have been able to take the original one and would have continued to be in pain until her next doc appt in 4 weeks or so.

**What's the MRI show? What's your initial differential?**

&gt;!The non contrast T1 (which I didn't show) doesn't show the tumor as bright. So what we have is a homogenously, avidly enhancing about 2.5cm mass that appears to be intraventricular. Its at the junction of the atrium and the temporal horn on the right. It results in an outflow obstruction and ""traps"" the temporal horn as best seen on the T2 image (image #3). There's extensive FLAIR signal through the right frontal, parietal and temporal lobes reflecting probably mostly vasogenic edema and this results in significant brain compression and nearly 1 cm of right to left midline shift.!&lt;

&gt;!An enhancing intraventricular mass like this should give concern for a choroid plexus papilloma or (considering all the edema what I was worried about) a choroid plexus carcinoma.  Although his age doesn't fit. The differential also must include a meningioma, ependymoma or, less likely considering his lack of systemic disease and history, but not impossible, metastatic diseases.!&lt;

**What's the next step in management? Any other studies?**

&gt;!I'm not sure we need much more in terms of work up. The treatment for this, as even a layperson might deduce, is surgery. There's nothing amongst the differential diagnoses where gross total resection would not be a our goal. He has considerable associated edema and mass effect which he's tolerating well but could certainly cause issues if progressive and so something like a biopsy and then consideration for non surgical control treatment, like radiation, would not be appropriate. I'm not sure we need to subject him to, say, a metastatic work up, preoperatively. The pathology from the operative specimen will tell us the diagnosis and if it is metastatic we can go looking for the primary afterwards. !&lt;

**Any anatomic considerations during treatment?**

&gt;!This is almost certainly on the non-dominant side in this patient. Even if we were on the left side we will be safely away from major cortical structures of concern, namely !&lt;[the language areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernicke%27s_area#/media/File:BrocasAreaSmall.png)&gt;!. But it is good to be cognizant of them. More importantly will probably be the white matter tracts we're going to violate on our way to the lateral ventricle. Namely !&lt;[the optic radiations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18981826)&gt;!. You may be able to limit this disruption by splitting the sylvian fissure and coming from above. We went through the middle temporal gyrus and limited the size of our working corridor and used no fixed retraction in taking this out. Disruption of this white matter pathway along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle may give you !&lt;[a superior quadrantanopia](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Disorders-of-the-optic-tract%2C-radiation%2C-and-lobe.-Fraser-Newman/6273cb2620588412a53288a0c8689814b6bb8231/figure/0)&gt;!, in this case left. !&lt;

It was a gross total resection. The patient did well. He probably has a left superior quadrantanopia on chairside testing. He has not been through formal visual field testing and like a lot of patient's with this he himself doesn't really appreciate it in everyday life. But otherwise he's recovered great.

pharmacy,How to Handle a Domestic Abuse Victim,"Hi all, I am a pharmacist at a popular chain. Tonight my last patient was a woman who was visibly relieved that we had her difficult-to-come-by medicine in stock. The first thing I noticed about her was the amount of mascara it looked like she had on and the fact that it had obviously been wet at some point recently. While we filled her medication, she rambled nervously the whole time and mentioned some disturbing things: her husband doesn‚Äôt let her drive, keeps the SIM card out of her phone, has broken her ribs before, was yelling at her about having to drive to multiple pharmacies to find it, to name a few.

I felt so much for this woman and looked up a local domestic abuse help center. I wrote down the phone number on the small Rx verbal pad sheet so she could fold it and hide it easily. I said, ‚Äúhey, maybe it‚Äôs none of my business but if you give these people a call, they may be able to help you.‚Äù Her: ‚ÄúDomestic abuse?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes‚Äù

She took the slip and thanked me and left. That was the end of a 12 hour shift, and also the closest I‚ÄôVE ever come to tears at work. Upon leaving, I am now wondering what more I could have done for her. I want to help her. I know it‚Äôs difficult for abuse survivors to even pick up the phone since they live in a constant state of fear. I wish I‚Äôd given her my personal number, or offered to drive her, or just told her to wait and took her to my place and then drove her to the center in the morning. It was severe, y‚Äôall. I have never seen anything like this. I know there‚Äôs a professional line and I‚Äôm sure ‚Äúkidnapping‚Äù her so I could help her get the help she needs is probably crossing it.

pharmacy,CVStressin' to the max,"Apologies for the somewhat long post in advance. Been a long time lurker.

Been at the three letter for a few years. Floated for a few months. Staffed for about a year. Filled in as temp PIC at a couple places. Then took a job as PIC about a year ago. Not the busiest/not the slowest store in the district. Do about 500 scripts/day. Overlap 2 days/week for a couple hours. Was made all sorts of promises at the time...""fully staffed"" ""great staff pharmacist"" ""we'll support you."" BIGGEST MISTAKE I COULD HAVE MADE. 

Fast forward to now. Staff pharmacist was moved within a couple months of me taking over. They were smart enough to leave the three letter for greener pastures after that move. Have had dreaded floaters ever since. They suck. No other words. Leave 99+ in the red in all the queues every shift and still get to come back. Every couple months I get a steady one for about a month, but they are usually untrained/no three letter experience/very slow and eventually leave. Haven't had a steady staff pharm in 9 months.

LT left beginning of this year on a leave and never came back. Store never had an inventory specialist. No certified techs. The techs there could barely QT, but have been trying to train them up. Had signed two of them up for the certified classes. Spent my own time going over the math with them. Helping them study. Then the day they get their certificate they leave for new hospital jobs.  

So now...no staff rph, no LT, no inventory tech, still no certified techs, and life is about to suck big time for cold/flu season. I call plenty of people to come in for interviews, but they don't show up or go to training and then don't show up for work. I don't understand.

Is it like this everywhere/anywhere else? It appears I'm the only sucker in my district doing all of this. Or I'm the only one who is getting tired of it? I go in hours early and stay hours late. No extra pay. The sh\*tty floaters do practically nothing and I only make $1/hr more than them. I do all the LT jobs, spend a good deal of my own time doing the schedules, do all the inventory jobs(process all the returns, IARS, out of dates), am the only one who checks the HUB/email. Spend one of my off days on my off weekend going through all the shelves for out of dates and filing/back-tagging scrips to be boxed up. I can't keep doing it. I can't ""train"" techs that I already have because now I really only have 2 with experience and everyone else is brand new. They can barely get scripts filled on float days (hence the 99+ reds).

DL continues to feed me the koolaid that it will improve. They are ""trying"" to help. And I keep falling for it. But it isn't. How do you ""recruit"" techs? The local fast food places pay more even with our ""new raises.""

medicine,"California Supreme Court may have just banned independent physician contracting with hospitals, possibly requiring physicians to be hospital employees. Thoughts?","Hello everyone,

For years the Borello test was used to determine whether or not someone was an independent contractor. On April 30th, the California Supreme Court rejected this in its *Dynamex* decision, and in its place created the ABC test. The test states the following:

* To meet its burden under the ABC Test, a business must establish each of three ABC factors:

A. That the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring  entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the  contract for the performance of the work and in fact;

B. That the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity‚Äôs business; and

C. That the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.

* Under the ABC Test, the failure of a business to establish any one  of the three factors means that a worker will be determined to be an  employee and not an independent contractor as a matter of law.

Now, I'm not a physician, so the intricacies of how you all interact with the hospitals in which you work is definitely not my area of expertise. However, I do know that, for the most part, physicians in California are not direct employees of the hospitals in which they work. I believe it is even illegal correct?

Does this new ruling have the potential to fundamentally alter the manner by which physicians engage in work in California?

I took a job cutting meat for $12 an hour and saved over $10,000 in one year and went to university. He accused me of thinking I was better than him (he barely passed high school and has no post secondary) and refused to give me a single penny to help. He makes over $100,000 a year and had no debt and no mortgage(at the time, before my mom left him.)

I paid for my first three years of school in cash, working 20 hours a week while in school collecting my pharmacy prerequisites and I worked two full time jobs each summer to save up enough to pay tuition in cash. At one point I was $2000 in debt, working 30 hours a week, taking an extremely heavy course load, suffering from IBS and complications from that (non stop rectal bleeding) and still received no help.

He actively tried to sabotage me by providing me with no space to study at home, and emotionally, physically, and verbally abused me and my mother at home. I would be studying for finals and he would ask me to rewire the basement for him and go completely ballistic on me when I would say I dont have time but I'll gladly help after finals (apparently not dropping my studies to install a three way switch is disrespectful)

After my mother divorced him and moved out in September 2017 the abuse got even worse. I was getting my last 3 prerequisite classes to apply to pharmacy school and he would abuse me every day, sabotage me, watch me struggle to afford to feed myself and pay for gas to get to school and offer no help, etc. I am 23 and I have grown a lot of grey hair in the last three years from stress.

One night while I was playing xbox after writing a midterm he comes down and starts screaming in my face and going completely ballistic again for no reason, threatening to beat the shit out of me(he is a 6'2"" 250 pound hulk and I'm 5'9"" 200 pound man that is fairly muscular but nowhere near capable of defending myself from someone like him) and he would not stop threatening me and screaming in my face. I threatened to call the cops on him and he started freaking out even more so I drove away in the night and stayed at my maternal grandparents house overnight. I skipped school the next day and waited for him to go to work, came home with my grandpas SUV and loaded all of my belongings up and moved out. He has tried to contact me dozens of times now by sending random pictures of things, random messages like ""what's up"" but never any apologies or admittance of wrong-doing. I have not replied to any messages once. My last memory of him is backing out of my driveway calling him a piece of shit and disappearing in to the night.

I finished my last prerequisite in April and applied to pharmacy school, and this week I found out i was accepted. I have done this almost entirely on my own with absolutely zero support(my dad just refused and my mom just isnt capable since she doesnt make a lot of money) I am the first person in my family to ever go to university. I am 23 and have a butt load of grey hair from everything I had to go through. This is the most proud I have ever been of myself.

medicine,Neuro Case Tuesday #2,"Week 1: [Intraventricular grade II, chordoid meningioma](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/8vw30g/neuro_case_tuesday/)

I'm back with a 93 year old female, independent with ADLs although in an assisted living community. She's about 2 hours out from the onset of a mostly expressive aphasia. Her symptoms actually start while she's playing bingo. She's got a right facial droop and her right upper extremity is better than gravity but has a drift. Other extremities seem intact. She nods appropriately to questions manages a few ""yes"" or ""no"" but is otherwise non-verbal. She obviously follows commands briskly. She has a left gaze preference which she can't overcome past midline. She seems to not recognize people to her right as well.

**What are you initial thoughts? Differential Diagnosis? Next step?**

&gt;!An acute neurological change in anyone should prompt thoughts of something vascular (or perhaps seizure). By vascular I mean an stroke (classic ischemic event) or bleed intracranially from any source. This one is pretty easy; she has a classic left middle cerebral artery syndrome from a left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. Other considerations might be a  hemorrhagic stroke, but the lack of alteration in consciousness and the degree with the symptoms match up with an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, make that pretty unlikely.!&lt;

&gt;!We grade these strokes in the States, and much of the rest of the world, with the NIHSS!&lt;

|&gt;!Evaluation!&lt;|&gt;!Grade!&lt;|
|:-|:-|
|&gt;!Level of Consciousness: The investigator must choose a response if a full evaluation is unattainable. A 3 is scored only if the patient makes no movement (other than reflexive posturing) in response to noxious stimulation.  !&lt;|&gt;! 0 = Alert; keenly responsive.  1 = Not alert; but arousable by minor stimulation to obey, answer, or respond.  2 = Not alert; requires repeated stimulation to attend, or is obtunded and requires strong or painful stimulation to make movements (not stereotyped). 3 = Responds only with reflex motor or autonomic effects or totally unresponsive, flaccid, and areflexic. !&lt;|
|&gt;! LOC Questions: The patient is asked the month and his/her age. The answer must be correct - there is no partial credit for being close. Aphasic and stuporous patients who do not comprehend the questions will score 2. Patients unable to speak because of endotracheal intubation, orotracheal trauma, severe dysarthria from any cause, language barrier, or any other problem not secondary to aphasia are given a 1. It is important that only the initial answer be graded and that the examiner not ""help"" the patient with verbal or non-verbal cues. !&lt;|&gt;! 0 = Answers both questions correctly.  1 = Answers one question correctly.  2 = Answers neither question correctly.  !&lt;|
|&gt;!LOC Commands: The patient is asked to open and close the eyes and then to grip and release the non-paretic hand. Substitute another one step command if the hands cannot be used. Credit is given if an unequivocal attempt is made but not completed due to weakness. If the patient does not respond to command, the task should be demonstrated to him or her (pantomime), and the result scored (i.e., follows none, one or two commands). Patients with trauma, amputation, or other physical impediments should be given suitable one-step commands. Only the first attempt is scored.  !&lt;|&gt;!0 = Performs both tasks correctly.  1 = Performs one task correctly.  2 = Performs neither task correctly.  !&lt;|
|&gt;!Best Gaze: Only horizontal eye movements will be tested. Voluntary or reflexive (oculocephalic) eye movements will be scored, but caloric testing is not done. If the patient has a conjugate deviation of the eyes that can be overcome by voluntary or reflexive activity, the score will be 1. If a patient has an isolated peripheral nerve paresis (CN III, IV or VI), score a 1. Gaze is testable in all aphasic patients. Patients with ocular trauma, bandages, pre-existing blindness, or other disorder of visual acuity or fields should be tested with reflexive movements, and a choice made by the investigator. Establishing eye contact and then moving about the patient from side to side will occasionally clarify the presence of a partial gaze palsy !&lt;|&gt;! 0 = Normal.  1 = Partial gaze palsy; gaze is abnormal in one or both eyes, but forced deviation or total gaze paresis is not present.  2 = Forced deviation, or total gaze paresis not overcome by the oculocephalic maneuver.  !&lt;|
|&gt;!Visual: Visual fields (upper and lower quadrants) are tested by confrontation, using finger counting or visual threat, as appropriate. Patients may be encouraged, but if they look at the side of the moving fingers appropriately, this can be scored as normal. If there is unilateral blindness or enucleation, visual fields in the remaining eye are scored. Score 1 only if a clear-cut asymmetry, including quadrantanopia, is found. If patient is blind from any cause, score 3. Double simultaneous stimulation is performed at this point. If there is extinction, patient receives a 1, and the results are used to respond to item 11.  !&lt;|&gt;!0 = No visual loss.  1 = Partial hemianopia.  2 = Complete hemianopia.  3 = Bilateral hemianopia (blind including cortical blindness).  !&lt;|
|&gt;!Facial Palsy: Ask ‚Äì or use pantomime to encourage ‚Äì the patient to show teeth or raise eyebrows and close eyes. Score symmetry of grimace in response to noxious stimuli in the poorly responsive or non-comprehending patient. If facial trauma/bandages, orotracheal tube, tape or other physical barriers obscure the face, these should be removed to the extent possible !&lt;|&gt;! 0 = Normal symmetrical movements.  1 = Minor paralysis (flattened nasolabial fold, asymmetry on smiling).  2 = Partial paralysis (total or near-total paralysis of lower face).  3 = Complete paralysis of one or both sides (absence of facial movement in the upper and lower face). !&lt;|
|&gt;!Motor Arm: The limb is placed in the appropriate position: extend the arms (palms down) 90 degrees (if sitting) or 45 degrees (if supine). Drift is scored if the arm falls before 10 seconds. The aphasic patient is encouraged using urgency in the voice and pantomime, but not noxious stimulation. Each limb is tested in turn, beginning with the non-paretic arm. Only in the case of amputation or joint fusion at the shoulder, the examiner should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice. !&lt;|&gt;! 0 = No drift; limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees for full 10 seconds.  1 = Drift; limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees, but drifts down before full 10 seconds; does not hit bed or other support.  2 = Some effort against gravity; limb cannot get to or maintain (if cued) 90 (or 45) degrees, drifts down to bed, but has some effort against gravity.  3 = No effort against gravity; limb falls.  4 = No movement.  UN = Amputation or joint fusion!&lt;|
|&gt;!Motor Leg: The limb is placed in the appropriate position: hold the leg at 30 degrees (always tested supine). Drift is scored if the leg falls before 5 seconds. The aphasic patient is encouraged using urgency in the voice and pantomime, but not noxious stimulation. Each limb is tested in turn, beginning with the non-paretic leg. Only in the case of amputation or joint fusion at the hip, the examiner should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice.  !&lt;|&gt;!  0 = No drift; leg holds 30-degree position for full 5 seconds.  1 = Drift; leg falls by the end of the 5-second period but does not hit bed.  2 = Some effort against gravity; leg falls to bed by 5 seconds, but has some effort against gravity.  3 = No effort against gravity; leg falls to bed immediately.  4 = No movement.  UN = Amputation or joint fusion!&lt;|
|&gt;! Limb Ataxia: This item is aimed at finding evidence of a unilateral cerebellar lesion. Test with eyes open. In case of visual defect, ensure testing is done in intact visual field. The finger-nose-finger and heel-shin tests are performed on both sides, and ataxia is scored only if present out of proportion to weakness. Ataxia is absent in the patient who cannot understand or is paralyzed. Only in the case of amputation or joint fusion, the examiner should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write the explanation for this choice. In case of blindness, test by having the patient touch nose from extended arm position !&lt;|&gt;! 0 = Absent.  1 = Present in one limb.  2 = Present in two limbs.  UN = Amputation or joint fusion!&lt;|
|&gt;!Sensory: Sensation or grimace to pinprick when tested, or withdrawal from noxious stimulus in the obtunded or aphasic patient. Only sensory loss attributed to stroke is scored as abnormal and the examiner should test as many body areas (arms \[not hands\], legs, trunk, face) as needed to accurately check for hemisensory loss. A score of 2, ‚Äúsevere or total sensory loss,‚Äù should only be given when a severe or total loss of sensation can be clearly demonstrated. Stuporous and aphasic patients will, therefore, probably score 1 or 0. The patient with brainstem stroke who has bilateral loss of sensation is scored 2. If the patient does not respond and is quadriplegic, score 2. Patients in a coma (item 1a=3) are automatically given a 2 on this item.  !&lt;|&gt;! 0 = Normal; no sensory loss.  1 = Mild-to-moderate sensory loss; patient feels pinprick is less sharp or is dull on the affected side; or there is a loss of superficial pain with pinprick, but patient is aware of being touched.  2 = Severe to total sensory loss; patient is not aware of being touched in the face, arm, and leg. !&lt;|
|&gt;!Best Language: A great deal of information about comprehension will be obtained during the preceding sections of the examination. For this scale item, the patient is asked to describe what is happening in the attached picture, to name the items on the attached naming sheet and to read from the attached list of sentences. Comprehension is judged from responses here, as well as to all of the commands in the preceding general neurological exam. If visual loss interferes with the tests, ask the patient to identify objects placed in the hand, repeat, and produce speech. The intubated patient should be asked to write. The patient in a coma (item 1a=3) will automatically score 3 on this item. The examiner must choose a score for the patient with stupor or limited cooperation, but a score of 3 should be used only if the patient is mute and follows no one-step commands !&lt;|&gt;!0 = No aphasia; normal.  1 = Mild-to-moderate aphasia; some obvious loss of fluency or facility of comprehension, without significant limitation on ideas expressed or form of expression. Reduction of speech and/or comprehension, however, makes conversation about provided materials difficult or impossible. For example, in conversation about provided materials, examiner can identify picture or naming card content from patient‚Äôs response.  2 = Severe aphasia; all communication is through fragmentary expression; great need for inference, questioning, and guessing by the listener. Range of information that can be exchanged is limited; listener carries burden of communication. Examiner cannot identify materials provided from patient response.  3 = Mute, global aphasia; no usable speech or auditory comprehension !&lt;|
|&gt;!Dysarthria: If patient is thought to be normal, an adequate sample of speech must be obtained by asking patient to read or repeat words from the attached list. If the patient has severe aphasia, the clarity of articulation of spontaneous speech can be rated. Only if the patient is intubated or has other physical barriers to producing speech, the examiner should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write an explanation for this choice. Do not tell the patient why he or she is being tested. !&lt;|&gt;!0 = Normal.  1 = Mild-to-moderate dysarthria; patient slurs at least some words and, at worst, can be understood with some difficulty.  2 = Severe dysarthria; patient's speech is so slurred as to be unintelligible in the absence of or out of proportion to any dysphasia, or is mute/anarthric. UN = Intubated or other physical barrier !&lt;|
|&gt;!Extinction and Inattention (formerly Neglect): Sufficient information to identify neglect may be obtained during the prior testing. If the patient has a severe visual loss preventing visual double simultaneous stimulation, and the cutaneous stimuli are normal, the score is normal. If the patient has aphasia but does appear to attend to both sides, the score is normal. The presence of visual spatial neglect or anosagnosia may also be taken as evidence of abnormality. Since the abnormality is scored only if present, the item is never untestable !&lt;|&gt;!0 = No abnormality.  1 = Visual, tactile, auditory, spatial, or personal inattention or extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation in one of the sensory modalities.  2 = Profound hemi-inattention or extinction to more than one modality; does not recognize own hand or orients to only one side of space.  !&lt;|

&gt;!In modern practice the NIHSS and other pre-hospital scales can in help in making the most important initial detremination which is whether this is likely to be an ischemic stroke from blockage of a large vessel. But even if we didn't calculate an NIHSS we should have a high suspicion that this patient has an occlusion of her left middle cerebral artery. Small vessel lacunar ischemic strokes lack cortical findings (like aphasia and gaze preference and neglect) while distal cortical ""small"" vessel strokes would not have so many of them.!&lt;

&gt;!This patient, and I would argue in modern practice, every patient with any suspicion of an acute ischemic stroke, needs an emergent head CT or some sort of quick stroke protocolMRI with vascular imaging CTA/MRA.!&lt;

**Describe the Head CT. Describe ASPECTS.**

&gt;!ASPECTS is an increasingly popular way to score non-contrast head CT for early ischemic changes in anterior circulation strokes (actually just internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery strokes; although that represents the vast majority of strokes). It judges six convexity middle cerebral artery territories, in addition to the insula, internal capsule, caudate and lentiform nucleus for hypodensities (early changes implying dead brain). For each area with hypodensity a point is subtracted so a score of 10 is perfect and a low score is very bad. Ischemic changes can take a while to show up It can be used to judge how much brain is dead and unsalvagable, but in the era of perfusion imaging should really only be used to aid in excluding people from therapy although some evidence exists that with better CT scan techniques and viewing techniques NCHCT is nearly as good as perfusion imaging in delineating viable versus nonviable parenchyma in stroke.!&lt;

&gt;!This patient has some hyperdensity in one middle cerebral artery territory, so although I didn't give you all the images her ASPECT was graded as 9. Still its very hyperdense and may represent an old stroke, although en route from the outside hospital we didn't have all of the patient's history.!&lt;

https://i.redd.it/bgfyi312q5911.jpg

Our patient was at an outside facility that did not have quick capability of obtaining a CTA +/- perfusion imaging. Therefor the stroke neurologist, via telestroke, told them to [administer IV tPA](http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/47/2/581) (I'll let the emergency medicine physicians and neurologists debate that one in the comments) and she was sent urgently, with the tPA chaser still hanging, via med flight to our institution which is a comprehensive stroke center.

She rolled off the helipad directly into the CT scanner without stopping for triage or checking into the ER. Time is obviously of the essence. In the CT scanner she got a CTA in addition to a CTP. I'll discuss the merits of the latter in a fewparagraphs.

https://i.redd.it/c3pnxvrsq5911.gif

**What do you see on the CTA?**

&gt;!Reading CTAs can be tough sometimes when you first start in ischemic stroke because you're looking for something that isn't there. We should be focusing on the left middle cerebral artery or left internal carotid artery as that's where the patient's symptoms lead us.  She's missing the very distal left middle cerebral artery, just at the bifurcation from the M1 into the M2s. It can be difficult to appreciate because she clearly has very good collateral circulation and the distal middle cerebral artery branches opacify well on the CTA.!&lt;

https://i.redd.it/abl52i5ir5911.jpg

**Do we need anything else? What's the next step?**

&gt;!In 2015 evidence based stroke therapy dramatically changed. The New England Journal of Medicine published five RCTs with more than 1200 patients (what are we cardiologists?!) that all demonstrated the benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO). The trials: MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, SWIFT PRIME, EXTEND-IA, REVASCAT). Here's the meta-analysis.  There was no difference in mortality and no increased risk of IPH in the meta analysis. The results were definitive and impressive and mechanical thrombectomy is the standard of care with patient's with large vessel occlusions and viable brain and limited comorbidities.!&lt;

&gt;!Several of the five trials did not use perfusion imaging and limited there patient's to as few as &lt;4.5 hours from onset. As long as the ASPECTS didn't show a lot of already dead brain they included patients. Other trials used perfusion imaging as part of patient selection and extended the time frame out to as many as 12 hours.!&lt;

&gt;!Since those five trials, two additional trials have extended the time frame out to up to 24 hours using perfusion imaging - DAWN and DEFUSE 3 (small disclaimer, where I trained was a DEFUSE 3 site). !&lt;

&gt;!Perfusion imaging attempts to delineate viable but at risk brain tissue (the penumbra) versus that tissue that has already gone on to infarct. It can help identify patients with unknown time of onset or very late time of onset who may have very good collaterals and still have viable brain to save.!&lt;

&gt;!I do think a reasonable, nuanced, work flow would be to only get a NCHCT (and see the ASPECTS) and a CTA on patient's with stroke symptoms within 6 hours and to add a CT perfusion (or MRI) to those more than 6 hours out. However the CTP is quick, the patients are already in the scanner (for the CTA) and so at my institution everyone simply gets a CTP. But it would've been completely appropriate to take this patient directly to the angiosuite without a CTP and attempt a thrombectomy.!&lt;

Here's the TMax:

https://i.redd.it/dihngu54v5911.jpg

https://i.redd.it/0fujlop4v5911.jpg

I'm pretty simplistic but when looking for viable candidates for thrombectomy I roughly equate the penumbra to an area with elevated transit times but preserved cerebral blood volume (i.e. transit times increased and CBV roughly equal).

Here's how [RAPID ](http://www.i-rapid.com/)interpreted our patient's CT perfusion:

https://i.redd.it/j7ztrknwu5911.jpg

**What happened?**

&gt;!We took this patient directly from the CT scanner to the angiosuite to perform a thrombectomy. I won't delve too specifically into the techniques but we, despite some evidence, didn't use a balloon guide, just a long sheath (a 6 Fr Shuttle) and went up with an aspiration catheter (in this case a 6 Fr Sofia). We tried aspiration first and its become my go to practice to try ADAPT first . We literally took the aspiration catheter right up to the clot, turned suction on and let it suck on it for about five minutes and then, with suction still running, pulled the aspiration catheter slowly out. We opened the vessel up in one pass. From the time we got access to the femoral artery to the time we shot an angiogram to confirm we had opened the vessel up it was 21 minutes. !&lt;

&gt;!The patient regained strength in her right arm pretty quickly and recovered her neglect. By the time of discharge she had some mild work finding difficulties from a residual aphasia but was answering with full questions and understood completely. She was 93 years old and didn't make it directly back to her assisted living facility but was doing very well at discharge.!&lt;

medicine,Exclusion criteria for treating hepatitis C?,"Treating hepatitis C ... what are your exclusion criteria?

Hi, I have recently begun treating my own patients for hepatitis C. From a medical perspective, it is a relatively simple protocol-driven process ([http://www.hcvguidelines.org](http://www.hcvguidelines.org)). I can not seem to get any of my office colleagues to treat their patients for hepatitis C, so with their blessing I am looking into doing so, about 50 in all. Doing so is a medical ""no brainer"" - 90-95&amp;#37; cure rate for a potentially fatal illness.

However, given the cost of some of these medications, there are ethical issues. For example, most of these patients are on Medicaid. As a taxpayer myself, I would have a real problem asking my fellow tax payers to pay $94,000 to treat someone for hepatitis C while they continue to drink a case of beer daily, or continue to do IV drugs.

Those are some of my personal exclusion criteria to treat hepatitis C. Some of my GI colleagues are overly stringent ... they won't treat people with depression without a psychiatrist involved (current wait is &gt;12 months).

IDSA weighs in thusly: ""Treatment is recommended for all patients with chronic HCV infection, except those with a short life expectancy that cannot be remediated by HCV therapy, liver transplantation, or another directed therapy. Patients with a short life expectancy owing to liver disease should be managed in consultation with an expert.""",23,32,2018-07-11,PHARMA,0.05973402410745621,0.9135881066322327,0.026677818968892097

I work 40 hours a week as a tech and am proud to say I take part time classes in preparation to apply to pharmacy school. Unfortunately my hourly pay just isn‚Äôt enough for me to gross $1,000 in two weeks. So for a while I was able to travel to another store the next city over and work 1-2 days of overtime per pay period and I would magically make like $1,300 that check. That was working swimmingly for me as it provided just enough income to pay rent, bills, and not have to do meal prep thru Food Lion for lunch and breakfast every damn day. 

Suddenly overtime store gets in trouble with corporate for handing out so much overtime pay (which as far as I‚Äôm aware the pharmacy manager had been provided in his budget.) Mind you this store is notorious for high turnover in techs and is also high-volume itself. Needless to say the hours I spent there each month busting my ass/ putting on my cheery customer service face and generally contributing to stock and prescription maintenance (and even making insurance co. and doctor calls when time allowed) went greatly appreciated. So now this time is cut and every store I approach in my area immediately turns me down when I mention any time work would be overtime.

I know I could just ask for a raise, but I‚Äôm not sure that would be approved and it feels petty given the fact that I just got one about 6 months ago. However biannual performance reviews are in the works so who knows.

Is there any literature -- particularly a mission statement or manifesto-type document of an official governing body -- where the terms of this ""higher standard"" that physicians are held to are concretely spelled out, with examples? I'm sure there are plenty of opinion or editorial pieces by respected physicians in respected medical publications over the years that preach about this concept. But is there anything approaching *law* about exactly what it entails?

As anyone who knows me either on Reddit or IRL would suspect, I am very much a freethinker when it comes to the world of medicine, and as such approach the notion of a ""higher standard"" with a healthy skepticism. If this higher standard involves being unusually compassionate, I'm all for it. But I've seen this phrase trotted out to justify (IMHO) unjustifiable levels of corporate compliance, obedience to the hierarchy, overwork, workplace abuse, and tolerance of treatment and conditions no human being should be suspected to. In short, I think abuse of this nebulous cultural artifact of ""we're held to a higher standard"" is directly responsible for the immense rate of burnout and physicians leaving the profession. As I said, the only higher standard I care to be held to is one of great compassion. Other than that, I want to be treated, and expected to act, like a regular guy, and I think there is nothing unreasonable about this.",101,145,2018-07-22,PHARMA,0.03883611038327217,0.9294077754020691,0.03175605461001396

It appears that these companies are actually somehow forcing pharmacies to sell drugs below wholesale and then charge a service fee to the pharmacy.  If that's actually true, how is that legal?  Why can't pharmacists decline to honor the cards?

He was in his 60s. Someone thought he had a blood cancer so he was transferred in. Hypoxemic resp failure. Requiring more and more O2. He would whimper, literally whimper anytime someone came in to do a blood gas, or a venipuncture for blood, or even a physical exam. 

He had no family, no friends. Only a cousin across the country. He seemed like a normal guy, but his fear of not only us but the unknown thing going on inside him was always obvious. 

A CT scan showed diffuse metastatic disease. Not a blood cancer, but definitely some kind of solid malignancy. There's no way he was asymptomatic until the day of his admission. He simply waited until his breathing became affected. 

One of the fellows belittled him a bit for his whimpering. I wasn't there to see it, I only heard it. To his face, though, while doing some sort of blood draw. Something along the lines of, Stop it, it's not that bad. But a little worse. Avoiding specifics here.

He was intubated maybe the second day because he couldn't maintain his sats. He was so, so afraid. We told him it would be okay, that it was to help his breathing. He required more sedation than some other people, even for a smaller guy. That's how anxious he was.

I left for the night. When I came back, I learned the team withdrew care and he passed away. His cousin who was his POA had apparently found some advanced directive from decades ago that said he wouldn't want life support if he had an irreversible condition. 

My problem, aside from his crass treatment, is that we didn't have a diagnosis. We didn't have pathology. No primary. My bigger problem is that despite his maybe childlike affect, he was never confused and had never given any indication he couldn't make his own decision. He could have said no to intubation. But he just whimpered, looking terrified. 

One minute he was being put to sleep, and by that night he was gone. He had no time to say goodbye to life. No time to reflect. No explanation as to why this was happening to him. No chance for me, or one of us, to sit with him and listen so he wouldn't be alone. 

One part of me knows that he would have been a difficult extubation. That maybe he would never have really had the kind of time -lucid mentality time- to digest what was happening. There would only be sedation on the vent. But my immediate response on hearing the news the next morning was anger. It was all too quick, I felt. I feel like the fellow, the team was so jaded by all these people who are kept alive by machine and medicine for weeks without hope that they jumped at the chance to put this man to sleep quickly. I get the mercy angle. But I still feel like it was wrong. 

He had this tiny teddy bear with him. It's been sticking with me, this image of the sick scared man with his little teddy bear and no one else except a distant family member miles away. I knew he was going to die, but I didn't want him to die alone. In a selfish way I guess I feel like I was also robbed of my chance to at least fix that aspect of this scenario.

But it got buried and was, after all, a bit tangential to that discussion. My curiosity has not been satisfied: who *is* this company? How did they get away with their abomination of a service for so long? Do they still exist and ply their shtik in backwater hospitals? I figured someone in r/medicine has worked in enough hospitals long enough to know something about this phenomenon:

Many American hospitals I've worked at, up until relatively recently, had CRT televisions padlocked to some lunky looking swivel arm, with either a coin box or a key-operated power switch. Each and every morning, each inpatient would be greeted by a surly employee, often only slightly healthier than him/her, of this private company which owned and operated these televisions. The employee would either empty the coin box or collect a relatively exorbitant amount of money for one day's worth of a selection of ~13 channels -- cash only either way -- and then lumber up onto a rickety hospital chair and turn the TV on with their key. Or off if it was already on and you either didn't have the money or didn't want to pay it. It must have taken some serious business acumen, plus or minus a great asshole lawyer, a strong union, or some other kind of major ""in"", to wrangle these hospital administrators into multi-decade binding contracts with the provider of a technology -- particularly one for nothing but entertainment -- long after the technology's obsolescence and failure as a viable pay-per-use business plan.

New grad with three years of hospital experience. I didn't want to do residency but wanted to work in a hospital after graduation. I started applying for open positions in early April on Glassdoor, Indeed, and Google.

I excluded jobs that specifically preferred residency/board certs. Roughly 60% of the jobs preferred 1 year of hospital experience while the rest either didn't specify or were truly entry level jobs. I did apply to 1-2 jobs that were most likely out of reach but worst case they said ""no thanks."" I am very happy to have the position in rural GA that I was offered and couldn't be happier. The market is really quite rough though. Needless to say I'm glad the process is over.

medicine,How normal saline makes SIADH worse,"I generally despise hyponatremia cases, but this is a simple explanation why NS makes SIADH worse. Just want to share with anyone who hates low sodium cases as much as I do: 

&gt;On the surface, it is easy to think that giving normal saline (154 mEq/L) to a patient with hyponatremia from SIADH will¬†help raise the serum sodium. But in the case of SIADH, giving normal saline will actually lower the serum sodium even more. Here is why:  
&gt;  
&gt;Sodium and water handling by the kidney are regulated independently: sodium by aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide; and water by ADH. In SIADH, sodium handling is intact and only water handling is out of balance from too much ADH. Therefore when administering 1 liter of normal saline to a patient with SIADH and a high urine osmolality, **all of the sodium will be excreted, but about half of the water will be retained** ‚Äì worsening the hyponatremia.   
&gt;  
&gt;With sodium handling by aldosterone intact, in order to raise the serum sodium with IV fluids, the sodium concentration of the administered IV fluids must be greater than the concentration of sodium in the urine ‚Äì not the serum.

We changed the rules with the [last meta thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7i7a7a/meta_lets_talk_about_subreddit_content_and/) to require *all* posts (not just link posts) to have user flair. That's led to much more work for us moderators but, in my opinion, much less slipping through the net to have to be reported and removed later on from the subreddit front page.

Of course, anything else you'd like to raise is entirely fair game. This thread will remain stickied for at least a week and the moderation team will try to keep an eye on the thread and respond to queries and suggestions as they come up.

Please bear in mind that this is a community of nearly 200,000 people and this subreddit is moderated by a few volunteers with day (and night) jobs. Proposed changes should be both philosophically and practically acceptable and should take into consideration this subreddit‚Äôs target audience of medical professionals.

Thanks,

pharmacy,How do we start a real organization that advances pharmacists?,"How would one go about creating an organization that actually promotes the field of pharmacy? Could we do this as a collective? 

APhA/ASHP and other state organizations are supposed to do just that, but they are actually lobby'd by big chains to push agendas that benefit them such as delegating pharmacist tasks to technicians. Their rationale was that it would allow pharmacists more time to do more clinical stuff but in reality it would just allow them to hire less pharmacists. They also fought to block the Illinois requirement to reduce workload on pharmacists. The only thing they seemingly do is advocate for provider status, something that may or may not happen.

I would love to have an organization that actually fights for pharmacists the way the AMA/ANA/AANP does for their colleagues.

pharmacy,Wanting to get out of pharmacy at 40 yrs old. Insight needed.,"39 years actually, but who's counting.

Retail pharmacy is all I know. I've worked in a retail setting since I was 21. Graduated in 2003. Been a chain manager for about 13 years in small town America and I'm drained. I need a career change soon. 

Unfortunately, I feel that making a change now will be a lot more difficult than if I were 10 years younger. I also don't really have any idea what I want to do. 

We all know how the job market is. The only pharmacist jobs here are mainly corporate retail. Occasionally a hospital job will pop up an hour away, but I practically know nothing about hospital pharmacy at this point. 

I'm just seeking advice from anyone who has made a major change from pharmacy later in life. Is it feasible? Should I stick with pharmacy and just leave retail behind? What, if anything, does a PharmD help with besides being a pharmacist.

medicine,Sexist Hostility in Medicine + Correcting Patients,"John Oliver's most recent episode of *Last Week Tonight* focused, in its entirety, on sexual harassment in the workplace (great episode, please watch). It was an excellent reminder that men (myself included) often do not appreciate the number of small (and large) infractions that many women experience everyday at work. Medicine has an infamously bad reputation on this issue and it doesn't appear to have been remedied (much) in the recent years.

A forthcoming publication in the National Academies of Science/Engineering/Medicine offers a disturbing account of sexual harassment and 'sexist hostility' that female medical students experience, especially relative to other fields. 

You can see the main graphs here (terrible quality image; DL the PDF for better quality): https://www.nap.edu/read/24994/chapter/5#60

**Important points**:

(1) ~50% of female medical students answered 'YES' to questions about experiencing 'sexist hostility'. Sexist hostility is the least problematic form of sexual/gender harassment surveyed, but includes comments like 'women don't belong in medicine,' 'women aren't smart enough to be doctors,' and 'medicine is a man's field,' etc. Female undergraduate and graduate students also experienced significant sexist hostility, ranging from 30-40%; however, it was rated as even more common by medical students across multiple populations. 

(2) Studies find that harassment from patients and their families is one of the top sources of sexual/gender harassment that female medical students and female physicians experience in hospitals. 

**Conclusions**:

Regarding sexist hostility by patients and their families, I'll echo the authors of the forthcoming National Academies report: 

""This inappropriate behavior by patients and patients‚Äô families needs to be recognized by leaders in academic medical centers, and specific statements and admonitions against sexual harassment should be included in the ‚ÄúRights and Responsibilities‚Äù that are routinely presented to patients and families as they enter into both hospital and outpatient care in academic medical centers.""

I'd go further than that, for male residents and male staff (and a lot of us already try to do this at my hospital), be vigilant for 'sexist hostility' in the workplace. It probably seems like a minor inconvenience from your perspective, but if you speak to your female colleagues about it, they hear it all the time. 

Think about the last time that a patient or their family referred to you as a nurse (while wearing professional clothes, with a stethoscope draped around your neck, and an ID bade reading 'Dr.'). Or the times that you hear families who are shocked that a young resident could possibly be a doctor. Our female colleagues experience this weekly; many, every single day. You can ask them, that shit adds up. I suggest that when you hear a patient engage in something constituting 'sexist hostility,' correct the patient (that's actually Dr. so-and-so or, she's actually your Dr., etc.), that way your female colleague doesn't have to do it for the fifth time this week. It's incredibly simple and they will absolutely appreciate it.

And that says nothing about the much more serious instances of sexual harassment that women in medicine also experience. That discussion will have to be left to a future post.",231,376,2018-07-31,PHARMA,0.1099867969751358,0.864530086517334,0.025483105331659317
