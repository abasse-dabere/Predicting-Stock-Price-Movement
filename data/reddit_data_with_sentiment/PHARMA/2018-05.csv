pharmacy,[UPDATE 2] I failed my last rotation before graduation. Good news: I appealed my grade and passed the remediation!,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/8d8ffz/i_failed_my_very_last_rotation_before_rotation_i/)

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/8dq9xe/update_i_failed_my_very_last_rotation_before/)

Hi everyone. I am, at the moment, ECSTATIC about the result. I am graduating on time! 

Just to recap for everyone: I failed my last rotation (inpatient) rotation about 2 weeks ago, reasons being I was not ""clinically ready"". My preceptor was sure that I would not be a good pharmacist, so sure that she failed me on my last rotation - my Hail Marry pass to graduation. I appealed the grade to the school board. Their decision: to send me on another 2 weeks ""rotation"" and get a different opinion on my clinical knowledge. 

So the remediation rotation started last Tuesday, and I was informed that it would last 2 weeks. Today is Tuesday, exactly 1 week after I started, and they informed me that I have demonstrated enough of my skills, and that they would pass me and I would no longer need to complete an extra week. 

I don't know what to say. I don't know what to think. I am just extremely happy. I can't thank everyone enough for the support. I am just immensely relieved that I was given a second chance and I did not let it go to waste. So THANK YOU! 

Now to the million dollar question: why did I fail in the first place? Honestly? I don't know. My gut feelings say my past preceptor just had it out for me and she would fail me no matter what I did. But why did she decide to do that to me, and not to every of her student, I truly don't know. I'm not sure if I want to find out. On one hand, I can't wait to put this stressful experience behind me and go about with the rest of my life. On the other hand, I would like to at least know why some people decided against me - possibly due to my personality? Something that I said or did? I don't know. I was never a terrible student in school, and I didn't have any problem with most of my rotation. So why put me through this nightmare? I can't for the life of me figure out. I guess I will never know. But ... to new beginnings, yeah? :)

medicine,Should Trump's Doctor be held responsible if he allowed Trump to write Trump's own medical assessment?,"It is alleged by Donald Trump's former personal physician, Dr Harold Bornstein (Gastroenterology), that a 2015 ""medical clearance"" letter that was said to have been written by the physician, was in fact dictated by Trump himself. 

This is the body of the letter including typo in first line:

&gt; To Whom My Concern:

&gt;I have been the personal physician of Mr. Donald J. Trump since 1980. His previous physician was my father, Dr. Jacob Bornstein. Over the past 39 years, I am pleased to report that Mr. Trump has had no significant medical problems. Mr. Trump has had a recent complete medical examination that showed only positive results. Actually, his blood pressure, 110/65, and laboratory test results were astonishingly excellent.
            
&gt;Over the past twelve months, he has lost at least fifteen pounds. Mr. Trump takes 81 mg of aspirin daily and a low dose of a statin. His PSA test score is 0.15 (very low). His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary.
            
&gt;Mr. Trump has suffered no form of cancer, has never had a hip, knee or shoulder replacement or any other orthopedic surgery. His only surgery was an appendectomy at age ten. His cardiovascular status is excellent. He has no history of ever using alcohol or tobacco products.
            
&gt;If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.

I remember reading this when it came out, puzzled about the language used (""showed only positive results,"" ""test results were astonishingly excellent,"" ""unequivocally...healthiest individual ever"") and the content itself (PSA results? Specific mentions of no orthopedic surgeries?), and now it makes much more sense if Trump wrote it himself. I also remember reading commentary from other physicians who were also scratching their heads.

I'm not trying to spark a political discussion as these remain allegations despite the fact that I believe them. My question is, if this is true, should the physician have reported this to the medical board when it first occurred? Instead of allowing a patient to author their own assessments riddled with obvious falsehoods?

It seems Dr Bornstein is now speaking out soon after gaining media attention for claiming to be ""raided"" in 2017 by White House personnel that seized and stole Trumps original medical records, and he seems to be acting quite dramatic about it (he says he felts raped by the situation). Although, he makes an excellent point that unless he was provided with a signed form by Trump authorizing the staff to remove the records, which he says he was not, then HIPAA was violated. Regardless his motives for speaking out now may be called into question and I'm not asking who you believe, but instead my question is solely, if true, if he should be held responsible for allowing that document to be submitted under his name without speaking up.",33,101,2018-05-02,PHARMA,0.10229658335447311,0.8665540218353271,0.031149329617619514

A friend of mine believes she has ""chronic Lyme disease"" and (because May is apparently Lyme Awareness Month) recently put a post about all of the ""treatment"" she's getting, complete with pictures. I haven't been in close touch with her over the past few years so I'm not sure when she got the ""diagnosis"" and started getting ""treatment"", but I'm not surprised--she'd been having a lot of vague symptoms for a while and her mom has been a long-term ""chronic Lyme"" patient. 

From everything I've read, ""chronic Lyme"" is a BS diagnosis and my friend is getting useless and possibly harmful ""treatment"" (not to mention how much money it's costing her). I'd love to convince her that she doesn't have chronic Lyme, but I'd settle for persuading her to stop the ""treatment"" she's getting. It seems like that'll be really tough, though; I'm guessing she has a lot invested (psychologically and financially) in this diagnosis and ""treatment"". It doesn't seem like talking to her will accomplish much, but I really want her to stop getting all this useless and invasive testing and ""treatment"".

One side of the discussion was that atropine should not be used as it can worsen infarction due to increased oxygen demand.

I argued that the hypotension is a greater risk for worsening infarction and should be used, if patient doesn't respond to a small fluid bolus.

I've actually asked the same question to 2 cardiologists and heard both sides of the argument as well.

&gt; Do not use SPS or other resins — The most widely used cation exchange resin has been sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS). Although ""SPS"" is often used as an abbreviation for sodium polystyrene sulfonate, SPS is actually a brand name for sodium polystyrene sulfonate in sorbitol.

&gt; Cation exchange resins do not appear to be more effective in removing potassium from the body than laxative therapy. Although uncommon, cation exchange resins can produce severe side effects, particularly intestinal necrosis, which may be fatal. (See 'SPS in rare settings' above.)

&gt; Given these concerns, SPS or other resins should not be used in patients with chronic mild or moderate hyperkalemia who do not have a hyperkalemic emergency and who do not require a prompt reduction in serum potassium.

pharmacy,Trends in Retail Pharmacy,"I want to provide a super high-level look at some trends affecting retail pharmacy, from a business perspective, and then get the feedback of the actual retail pharmacists.

1. The one we all talk about here, there are more pharmacists entering the market than the market can currently employ at sustainable, high wages. It has led to shorter hours being offered to new graduates (and the veteran pharmacists) and elimination of raises and bonuses at some chains. This trend likely continues.

2. Specialty pharmacy is on the rise. A big rise. Estimates always paint gloom, but those estimates from the past are actually looking like reality in the present: specialty pharmacy as a number of scripts, as a percentage of total, and obviously for cost- is increasing.

3. Specialty pharmacy products are usually higher margin products than traditional pharmacy brands or generics. More and more of these speciality products are going through certain specialty pharmacies (the ones attached to PBMs).

4. Speaking of which, Optum, Caremark and Express scripts are now responsible for adjudicating about 70% of Rxs nationally. This trend is unlikely to grow, but also unlikely to shrink.

5. Mail order has receded. All of those annoying initiatives to switch people over to 90-day fills has been credited with the decline in mail order both in volume and as a share of total Rxs (in addition to laws and employers backing off mandatory mail order).

6. With specialty pharmacy being carved out to PBM-affiliated specialty pharmacies, retail is increasingly missing out on higher margin products. Specialty products are only growing in profitability while traditional pharmacy is declining in profitability.

7. Because of the costs associated with specialty pharmacy products, reimbursement is decreasing in the traditional pharmacy channel- but not so much, as you would guess, with their own affiliated specialty pharmacy channels. To balance increased payments in specialty channels, reimbursement is sliding in traditional spaces.

8. An increasing share of pharmacy profits, then, are being shifted away from traditional pharmacies and towards specialty pharmacies- despite volume picking up from declines in mail order. Retail pharmacies are becoming increasingly less profitable as stand-alone profit generators under the old (but current) model (I know many believe MTM, counseling and patient care will change that).

9. An increase in prescription volume, but a decrease in per script profit overall is causing strain on staffing and quality of work for pharmacy staff among other reasons. It's working more for less money.

10. Health insurance mergers and leverage from GPOs and wholesalers has created ""preferred network pharmacies"" which have accepted lower reimbursements for greater volume- something like with doctors' clinics a few years ago and preferred provider benefit designs. This has exacerbated the problem and forced many pharmacy chains to integrate with their distributor, purchaser or wholesaler to unforeseen (as of yet) rewards or consequences.

What do you think is the answer? Do any trends seem way off from your experience? What do you think the market responds with?

SOURCES: mostly taken from Drug Channels Institute's annual report, with some additions from my own commentary, KFF and ESI's drug trend report.

pharmacy,"Cannabis (Marijuana) possession infraction, license/employment ramifications","Please only respond if you have a real life example. Got caught with cannabis resulting in an infraction (no misdemeanor or felony). Looking to see if anyone has had this happen to them in the past and if one has to disclose it when applying for a pharmacist license renewal (IL) or if it will show up on a background check when applying for other positions. The internet is full of armchair lawyers and I am looking for a concrete example if this has happened to someone in the past.

Edit: Thank you all for all of the honest responses. I am mainly worried about the Board finding out when i renew my license in 2 years. It seems the safest course of action would be to spend a bunch of money on lawyers to get the infraction dismissed/off my record. It looks like it will appear on any real background check and may affect future employment opportunities. I will be sure to come back and update what happens in case any other redditors are looking for advice.

For those taking a rather draconian angle to this infraction and stating that I am an idiot. I am definitely an idiot, of that I have no doubt.

pharmacy,Pharmacist Refused to Provide Vaccine - Confused,"TL:DR - I went to get an MMR vaccine, the pharmacist refused because they weren't comfortable. Looking for suggestions as to why I would have been refused. 


Hoping a pharmacist can explain what happened and why:


I needed to get an MMR vaccine as I'm visiting a place with recent measles outbreaks. I called ahead to the pharmacy, made sure the vaccine was in stock, and went in to get it administered.


When I arrived, they had me fill out the release forms, processed my insurance and payments, then had me wait for the pharmacist.


When the pharmacist came in, they did not have the vaccine with them. They asked me if I was aware of the risks of the vaccine, I said yes, and acknowledged that I signed the release. They then informed me that this would be a live vaccine, and I could actually contract measles from it. I said that I am aware that there is some risk of getting ill, but had discussed it with my doctor and we felt that the risk of illness was lower with the vaccine than without it.


The pharmacist then told me they would not be vaccinating me. I asked why, and they just said, ""I'm not comfortable."" I asked for clarification and they refused. I then asked for the other pharmacist to administer, and they refused to ask them. I went to the desk to ask for the other pharmacist, and the original pharmacist started talking to them, and ultimately the other pharmacist refused as well, and said the same thing, ""I'm not comfortable,"" with no further details. I then asked to be refunded and have the charge to my insurance reversed, and they said it's already been cancelled. I don't see this on my card or insurance yet, but am withholding judgement. 


Any idea what happened here? I went to another pharmacy to get the vaccine with no issue, it was just a wasted hour of time and extreme annoyance. I'd love some insight on why I would have been refused for a vaccine. I've never heard of this happening.

I’ll be done with my B.S next year and was actually wondering if a PharmD would be something worth pursuing.  I understand that the market is crashing but I’m mostly considering it for more opportunity to progress within the company and the fact that it’s something I genuinely like.

I grew up around pharmacy with my dad being a DPR at WAG and my mother a staff pharmacist at Rite Aid so I feel like have solid expectations and an understanding of the pros and cons of it.

My big concerns now are my age and the workload to acquire said degree. I’m 24 so I probably would not graduate until I’m 30+. I’m also not sure if it’s something I’m going to be able to handle along with my current position. I’m salaried so not too worried about being able to work with the schedule. 

The general consensus seems to be that Pharmacy school is relatively difficult and I’m just not sure if I can do it along with this 50-60hr job.

In your opinion is this something worth pursuing? Should I step down to ease the load?

""I don't think this is Gilbert's. I've seen this once before - hyperbetacaroteninemia. How many carrots do you eat a day?""

""Well my dad has Gilbert's and I think that's probably all it is... I've had this for a long time...""

""How many carrots??""

""Um, a usually eat 1 carrot a day, rarely 2? But-""

""Yep, it must be it! Let's check for it!"" he exclaimed, as he scribbled an order for serum beta-carotene, as well as bilirbuin.

The next day I walked to my local generic commercial lab place and handed them the script. The quizzical look on the worker's face showed that she clearly had never checked someone's beta-carotene level and after some consternation and aggressive typing, she told me that the bilirubin is included in my insurance but the beta-carotene would be $850 (and remember, this is NOT the USA). I clearly deferred. 

Some time passes and the GP asks me eventually about the results. I relayed to him the above story and he paused and said, ""well, we can just check it here."" See, the preceding patient had been in the military and had some insurance where he never saw a bill, so the GP just asked his nurse to draw my blood and then ordered the lab tests under this vet's ID. 

A week later I'm back in clinic and I idly ask, ""so...did the results come back?""

""Yes. You have Gilbert's""

medicine,Mandatory corporate training on patient communication and deescalation - abusive patients. Really?,"About 15 year ago, a few years out of fellowship, I got trapped in a clinic exam room by a patient.  He started telling me about his gun, violent acts he had perpetrated on various people, sexual assaults he had committed,  pretended to swing a baseball bat at my head, and then described various sex acts that he would perform/make me perform after he ""found me later."" I had no idea if he had a gun or not, he was between me and the door, so I tried to stay calm, not scream because I didn't want anyone else to get hurt, and I tried just to let him talk himself out so he wouldn't get more agitated and shoot anyone.  After about 45 minutes, one of the nurses came to check on me.  I cheerfully ended the appointment, he left, we called security and the police.  Security walked me to my car for awhile, the police did extra drive trips by our house etc for awhile.  Then he came back and ultimately got tasered in my lobby for assaulting a police officer and hauled off to jail.  The police and security took it very seriously. A lot of the other physicians told me I overreacted and that I should have done X, Y, or Z.  I found out later that prior to these 2 instances with me this same person attempt to physically assault a very large male internist \(employed by the same health system\) and tried to run over a security guard in the parking lot shortly thereafter. 

In retrospect \(ie right now\), I am really really angry that I was not offered support or help or that admin didn't place boundaries after the first 2 incidents.  When he came back I had a full on panic attack in clinic and was crying in my office: I called my administrator telling him what was going on and he didn't offer to come over to help.  Admin didn't even bother to show up even after he got tasered \- I was left to deal with the police and the staff by myself.  A few weeks later admin did have a meeting on how we \(meaning me\) could have handled it better.  I wasn't offered \(but to be fair nor did I seek out\) any sort of assistance or counseling or whatever for this. 

I thought I was over this until I went to an annual, mandatory training today on handling challenging clinic situations.  One speaker was talking about how we needed to be in control and deescalate these situations on our own even if the patient is yelling and in our faces.  I finally raised my hand and asked what we were supposed to do if we were being physically threatened.  The response ""well, its not like we're cops walking the beat"" \(because clearly no one ever threatens physicians\) and I said ""what if a very large male person is in my face threatening to assault me?""  The response was ""I guess we should have been more clear about what we were talking about. But you should just leave the room if that happens.""  Yeah. Thanks. Super helpful if the guy has a gun or has me cornered with my back against the wall, him a few inches from me, and the door way way across the room. 

I am trying not to let this ruin my weekend but I am angry all over again about having to deal with this without administrative support, angry about being told it is my responsibility as a provider to deescalate what feels like a very dangerous situation, and angry at myself for essentially having a constant panic attack for the last 5 hours.  

I am so tired of being made to feel like I have to fix and take care of all my patients.  Why should I have to treat a non\-emergent patient who is threatening violence and to rape me? Why should I have been made to feel like it was my fault some jackass with felony convictions for violence got tasered in my lobby?  Why should we have to learn how to deescalate crap like this?  Why is it my responsibility to manage violent patients?

This was received with general bemusement all around.

The second was a case of an elderly patient with hip pain, unable to mobilise but no clear fracture on x-ray.

medicine,We have been completely lied to.,"I was reading a post on Sermo regarding physician burnout (no surprise), and came across this quote:

&gt;How we salivated at the idea of searchable records, of being able to graph fever trends, or white blood counts, or share records at a keystroke with another institution — “interoperability”! — and trash the fax machine. If every hospital were connected, we would have a monster database, Big Data that’s truly big and that would allow us to spot trends in disease so much earlier and determine best practice and predict complications. But we didn’t quite get that when, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, $35 billion was eventually steered toward making medicine paperless.

&gt;My A.T.M. card is amazing: I can get cash and account details all over America and beyond. Yet I can’t reliably get a patient record from across town, let alone from a hospital in the same state, even if both places use the same brand of E.H.R., for reasons that are only partly explained by software that has been customized for each site. This is not like sending around a standard Word file. And so, too often the record comes by fax.

I read that, and got angry.  Not because I disagreed, but because the author was completely correct.  I saw potential about 20 years ago, and was at least cautiously optimistic when large amounts of money and incentives were going to implement EHRs.  

Now, nearly 2 decades later, I see that we were sold a bill of goods.  It's all a bunch of garbage.  I am excited that I don't spend hours looking for a paper chart.  But beyond that, we haven't progressed much.  We were promised integration between health records.  I could see the clinic note from the PCM about the foot ulcer from 2 weeks ago, and get the culture results.  The echocardiogram from another hospital done 3 months ago would be a click away.  I wouldn't have to wonder what the discharge medications were from the pneumonia hospitalization last month.  I could even get the operative report from the washout of the failed total knee replacement done 2 years ago.

It's a bunch of crap.  We get none of it.  We are now chained to the computer, and in the name of ""quality"" spend hours adding phrases and codes to make sure that all ""core measures"" are met.  There is absolutely no interoperability to speak of.  Even EHRs of the same vendor aren't interoperable due to both differences in configuration and enforced segmentation which is done in the name of ""privacy and HIPAA"" but I suspect has more to do with limited patient mobility and keeping their information in their own house.

Data still comes and goes via fax machine.  Signatures are still on paper.  Interoperability, where it exists, is limited and expensive.  Want to integrate  your office EHR with Labcorp?  Sure.  You just gotta pay thousands (on top of the tens of thousands annually for the EHR) for the interface.  Same with Quest.  How do we get information for our own hospital system into our EHR?  Same way we did 20 years ago.  Print it out from the hospital EHR, scan it in, and then stick a name on it.  

And, to really put the cherry on top of this, an administrator very proudly rolled out a tool so physicians can track their own productivity!!   They spent thousands of man-hours on this thing.  1 hour of mandatory training (it's ok, I really didn't want to eat anyway).  And the module for automated outlier screening, promised &gt;2 years ago, is still nowhere to be found.

pharmacy,EMCrit/PulmCrit/FOAMed as clinical resources: A reminder to think critically,"I often see posters here and on /r/medicine post links to emcrit/pulmcrit as a way to provide an answer to a clinical question. My perception is that the emcrit/pulmcrit posts are viewed as evidence-based responses and thus are “true”. But I think we need to remember that emcrit/pulmcrit and probably many of the FOAMed sites are blogs, and at the end of the day what is presented the authors’ opinions. Yes, the opinions are supported by evidence, but the evidence is presented to support the authors’ opinions, not as a systematic look at the literature. Thus these blog posts represent evidence-based *opinion*, not evidence-based medicine. 


There was a thread here the other day about an alert firing for QT prolongation with azithromycin, and someone posted a link to a [pulmcrit post](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/myth-busting-azithromycin-does-not-cause-torsade-de-pointes-or-increase-mortality/) that reviews the evidence for azithromycin and cardiac risk. I’m going to pick on that specific pulmcrit post not because the information is wrong *per se* but because (a) it is at least somewhat in my domain of knowledge and (2) it is a good example of many of the issues I have with the posts I see on emcrit/pulmcrit.


The pulmcrit post in question starts with an explanation of the biological basis for a potential effect of azithromycin on cardiac conduction. Here the author notes that: 

&gt; “Azithromycin is not cleared by the CYP system, and has a low affinity for the hERG channel (27 times lower, for example, than erythromycin)(Giudicessi 2013).  Thus, from a molecular perspective azithromycin would be expected to be fairly safe… Azithromycin does not predispose to torsade de points, but instead it actually blocks the pro-arrhythmic activity of erythromycin.  The inability of azithromycin to cause torsade de pointes has been confirmed in two other studies using a dog model, even with enormous doses of azithromycin (Thomsen 2006, Ohara 2015). Thus, azithromycin seems to effect the heart in a fundamentally different way than erythromycin.”

These are valid statements, and indeed there are pharmacologic differences between azithromycin and the other macrolides which certainly cloud the discussion of whether or not QT issues and adverse cardiac events are a class effect or if azithromycin is spared. The author cites several animal studies that would support the assertion that azithromycin has a different cardiac risk profile from erythromycin. This is a neat way to sidestep all the cardiac issues associated with other macrolides. However, extending animal data to humans is not always reliable. A [conduction study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17088870) in a dog model of chronic atrioventricular block found “no proarrhythmic properties” for moxifloxacin, and yet few people would argue that moxifloxacin does not cause QT prolongation in humans. In fact, it is probably the worst offender among currently available systemic fluoroquinolones. Maybe the same is true for azithromycin.

The author then moves through a *very* brief “discussion” of case reports that is essentially devoid of meaningful content. The argument is that in every case of QT prolongation/TdP associated with azithromycin there were additional risk factors for QT prolongation present. The presence of concomitant risk factors does not mean azithromycin is not a risk factor itself. Perhaps no QT prolongation/TdP would have occurred in these patients if azithromycin was not added to the mix. Furthermore, the author makes the dubious assertion that:

&gt; “Given the millions of courses of azithromycin which have been prescribed, if azithromycin caused torsade de pointes one would expect to see more persuasive reports of this.”

While this assertion certainly makes sense, it by no means proves anything.

Next the article begins a discussion of two observational studies that examined the association between azithromycin and cardiovascular death and had conflicting results. In this section they present an alternative reason as to why one study ([Ray et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22591294)) found an association between azithromycin and cardiac death, namely that:

&gt; “…patients receiving levofloxacin or azithromycin were more likely to be undergoing treatment for pneumonia or COPD.  Such patients tended to have more comorbidities and receive more medications.  Thus, use of azithromycin or levofloxacin may have merely *correlated* with a higher risk of death, rather than *causing* death.”

Meanwhile, in regards to [second observational study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23635050) that did not find an association between azithromycin and cardiac death:

&gt; “Ray et al found a slightly *lower* mortality rate among the beta-lactam group compared to the no-antibiotic group, which doesn't make sense.  Patients receiving beta-lactams were acutely ill (unlike the no-antibiotic group), so the beta-lactam group ought to have a higher mortality.  Overall, Svanstrom's results seem more plausible, suggesting that there is no increase in mortality due to azithromycin.”

These “critiques” of the Ray and Svanstrom articles are particularly weak. In reading the sections I quoted above, the arguments essentially boil down to “correlation =/= causation” vs. “this makes more sense”. It is nice when results make sense, but just because they don’t sense doesn’t make them incorrect. John Snow’s findings regarding the epidemiology of a cholera outbreak were not biologically plausible at the time. Semmelweis was ultimately institutionalized because no one believed his handwashing ideas (among other reasons). On what side of history will the azithromycin debate ultimately fall? While plausibility is one of the Bradford Hill criteria for causation, it is by no means perfect.

Instead, the author could have presented a more in-depth critique of the methods of both articles. How were outcome definitions operationalized? Were outcomes similarly defined and captured between studies? Were the patient cohorts similar? What were the data sources? Are the data sources valid? How was azithromycin exposure assessed and operationalized? How was confounding addressed? Were all relevant confounders addressed? Are any major confounders not addressed, that could account for the findings? There are so many aspects to observational studies and valid criticisms of both these trials in particular without having to resort to “correlation =/= causation”.

From here, the author of the post goes on to discuss several RCTs and an associated meta-analysis of azithromycin for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease, noting the non-significant results. Certainly RCTs represent a high level of evidence, and these data present compelling evidence against the risks associated with azithromycin. However, the populations in the referenced RCTs may not be representative of those in the cited observational studies. For example, the [WIZARD Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13129985) included patients with stable coronary artery disease, and well the methods are sparse I assume the patients were not acutely infected at enrollment. So there may be some issues in applying the safety of azithromycin in these patients to the types of patients looked at in the observational trials.

The authors also note that perhaps the reason why the initial study by Ray et al. caused so much excitement and confusion because it was interpreted by many without the necessary clinical context related to the pharmacology, electrophysiology, and existing clinical data surrounding azithromycin and sudden cardiac death. The author claims that the Ray article is inconsistent with subsequent evidence, and suggests that study findings should be considered in the larger clinical context. Ironically, at the time of the post (July 27, 2015), the author failed to revisit the clinical context, or else he may have identified at least [three](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25409476) [additional](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24893087) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615307) had been published. Knowing these other studies were published when the post in question was created just reinforces the perception that the cited literature is used to support the author’s opinion, rather inform it.

Finally, the authors conclude that the study by Ray et al was:

&gt; “…inconsistent with preceding evidence, and has now been shown to be inconsistent with subsequent evidence as well.”

And that:
&gt; “At this point, the concept that azithromycin causes torsade de pointes and cardiovascular death should be discarded.  It is not supported by molecular, electrophysiological, or clinical evidence.”

What a strong conclusion! In the “About PulmCrit” page, the author notes that posts are “not intended nor advertised to represent the absolute truth or last word on the topic.” And yet the entire tone of the piece in question comes off as very authoritative, and the conclusions certainly sound definitive. But the content is just not enough to back that up. Honestly the entire post is a poorly argued, incompletely referenced, and weakly critiqued exploration of a few papers used to support what was likely a pre-existing opinion on the matter. And while the information is informative, I think it is presented as fact in a way that is disingenuous at best to possibly dangerous at worst.

Honestly this is mostly a moot point. For the most part, I agree with the author’s conclusions. In most, if not all patients, the risks of cardiac death with azithromycin were likely overhyped. The presence of several RCTs that did not find an association between azithromycin and cardiac outcomes certainly provides evidence against increased risk, although these were in different patients and looking to answer a different (albeit related) question. But I think there is sufficiently mixed results from observational data to give one pause. Plus we have avoided entirely the issues with other macrolides and whether or not that can be extended to azithromycin or not. I personally would still avoid azithromycin if possible in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation and TdP (plus most patients who get azithromycin probably don’t need any antibiotics at all, but that is beside the point). I would encourage all of us to remember to consider any presentation of evidence with a critical eye, do your own research, and reach your own conclusions.

59yo female with Type 2 dm, htn, hld presented with sore throat for a few days as well as significant dysphagia. She had been febrile, but no n/v/diarrhea. She hasn’t been able to eat well for about 48hrs. CT shows some soft tissue edema and inflammation in the oropharynx and a questionable soft tissue mass. At the outside hospital she was transferred from, labs were notable for anion gap of 22, lactate 0.7, bicarb 17.  Her vital signs were unremarkable. Med list was incomplete, but included metformin, glimepiride, asa, atorvastatin, Xanax. In our ED labs as follows:

Na 143
K 3.9
Cl 109
Bicarb 12 
Gluc 160
BUN 14 
Cr 1

Lactate 0.8


Wbc 14k

UA sg 1.044, glucose &gt; 500, ketones 80

From an infectious standpoint she was stable and improving  on Unasyn. She had also received 10mg iv dexamethasone at the OSH.

How would you work up this acid-base disturbance? 


UPDATE

so everyone pretty much hit on all the points but I’ll start from the top. At 1a I was most worried about her airway which thankfully improved, but I worked up the gap initially and because she was stable I didn’t go toooo crazy in the middle of the night, but here’s what panned out, pretty much what all of you collectively got:

—Elevated anion gap acidosis at 22; Normal osm gap, no salicylate, beta hdrodybutyrate 6 (pretty high)
—Non anion gap component as well (her delta delta is slightly less than 1)
—she had been on canagliflozin, ie your sglt 2 inhibitor!!
—for a nagma, check the urine gap. Hers was 20+, ie renal Lois of bicarb, thought to be 2/2 kind of an rta picture in the setting of sglt 2 inhibitor (this one I’m still not fully grasping)

medicine,Friday Case,"I know I'm just a student, so I hope this is okay, but I got to be involved in a fairly cool diagnostic case a while back. After reading /u/h1k1's case from yesterday, I thought maybe this would be a good one to present here.

An early 40's white male presents to his PCP with a c/c of dysphagia over the last 6 months. He says the dysphagia has been present for years, but has previously been mild, and has waxed and waned in severity. In recent months it has become progressively more noticeable and bothersome. He can still tolerate both liquids and solids, but says that food just feels ""funny"" when he swallows, like it takes longer than it should to go down. What's worrying him most is that he has recently developed some shortness of breath in addition to the dysphagia. 

PMHx is significant only for mild, intermittent heartburn which is well controlled with Tums PRN. Family history is significant for CAD and lung cancer, though he cannot recall any details past that. The patient works in a local factory and has been a 2ppd smoker for the past 25 years. He drinks socially and does not use any illicit substances. 

He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, or any recent weight loss. ROS is negative except as previously stated. 

On exam, the patient is a well-appearing male in NAD. Vitals unremarkable. Auscultation reveals some crackles in bilateral lung bases, otherwise no abnormalities. Heart is regular and without murmurs, rubs, gallops, or heaves. Abdomen soft/nontender without distention. Extremities acyanotic, mild pitting edema in the lower extremities. Gross neuro exam normal. 

CBC/BMP is stone cold normal. You get a CXR in the office, which can be [seen here](https://imgur.com/a/wkcU3FV) (note: these aren't his actual films as I don't have access to that EMR anymore, but fairly representative). 

What are your next steps? What's on your DDx? I'll update throughout the day as I take breaks from Step 1 studying.


**UPDATE #1** 

The patient was sent to CT given his CXR findings, which were thought to be suspicious for LA enlargement vs mediastinal mass. With his family history of cancer and his smoking status, lung cancer was at the top of the differential (and was how I got involved with his case).

Unfortunately I don't have his actual scan to post, but CT revealed a ~3x4cm subcarinal mass that the radiologist called ""suspicious for cancer"" (I'll try to post a representative image in a while). Pt was referred to pulmonology for EBUS, which was inconclusive (path report showed only normal respiratory tract cellularity). 

Now what?


**UPDATE #2**

His EBUS was repeated with the same result. Given his inconclusive EBUS’s, he was referred to CT surgery for a surgical biopsy with the hope of a definitive diagnosis. We saw him the day after his second EBUS, and scheduled his biopsy for about a week later. 

We got a call from the ED a day or two later. The patient presented to the ED almost in extremis. Tachy to the 110s, a bit febrile, systolics in the low 100s while sitting up but dropping to ~70s when supine. 

We got a repeat CT, which had to be done with the patient prone in order to maintain his BP and keep him from getting floridly dyspneic. His previous 3x4cm mass now looked something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/txUlSSE.jpg)

Now what?


**FINAL UPDATE**

After some anxiolysis and O2, the patient was doing okay. He still profoundly dropped his pressure anytime he laid supine, but he was maintaining his hemodynamics while sitting or prone, so we decided not to intubate him. At this point we were mostly focused on how we could get tissue for diagnosis without killing him, as we didn't think his cardiac function could withstand anesthesia and a stint on the OR table. 

We had IR tap the mass while he was prone, which pretty damn challenging--his intercostal/accessory hemiazygos system was in the way just about everywhere, and there was no good path to the mass. Still, they worked some magic and got access. We were hoping to get some tissue for biopsy, but we ended up getting about 300cc of frank pus out instead.

It turns out that the patient had a congenital bronchogenic cyst that had fluctuated in size for most of their life, and recently had begun to swell, causing his dysphagia and his CHF symptoms. We think the 2 EBUS's then led to an infection within the cyst, which is what pushed him into extremis so quickly. 

Draining the cyst resolved his symptoms pretty immediately, and we gave him some abx and a referral to a quaternary center where he had the cyst removed and ablated surgically, as our surgeon didn't feel as comfortable doing that themselves.",50,208,2018-05-25,PHARMA,0.09753252938389778,0.860205352306366,0.04226209595799446

medicine,Dresscode for doctors in different countries,"Greetings fellow students and doctors. I'm currently in my 2nd year of medschool in Sweden and we've started going on clinical practice, which means a lot of learning hygiene routines and such. 

In Sweden, the doctors coat has been removed from the dresscode because of hygiene (or to save money), and doctors are required to wear scrubs all the time (same for nurses, physiotherapists, and so on) while being in the hospital/healthcare center. If you are going into surgery, you change to another kind of scrubs with a different color. All scrubs are provided by the hospital/healthcare center, i've never heard of anyone bring their own scrubs. They cannot be worn outside of the hospital/healthcenter.

Now, to me this makes sense from a hygiene perspective, that when u are in contact with patients, you use appropiate clothing. But when watching documentaries from abroad, i see that in the UK, and also in the US, the doctors are usually using dress shirts and suit pants, sometimes a whole suit. I've also heard that in the US, nurses are supposed to bring their own scrubs, and sometimes wear them when traveling between home and work.

First of all, how does it work in your country/your place of work? And secondly, whats your take on this matter? Should doctors always wear scrubs when meeting the patients?

My rxm doesn’t speak to me unless it’s work related. When I gave her my letter of resignation she told me that the hospital was desperate enough to hire anybody.

From the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which this article also cites:

I do want to share that the concerns I had in this post were not issues on the NAPLEX at all &amp; I did end up taking the pre-NAPLEX which I found to be quite helpful in terms of setting up appropriate expectations. Good luck everyone!

Hi everyone! For those of who you used RxPrep to study for the NAPLEX - did you feel it accurately represented the types of questions and knowledge required to do well on the NAPLEX? 

I'm asking because several of my friends and I have been working through the book and aren't doing quite as well as we were expecting when it came time to do end-of-chapter questions and the practice test offered through RxPrep. We are solid on major concepts/DDIs/ADRs but getting questions wrong when they use an uncommon brand name, uncommon side effects, etc.

Question is: am I overthinking this? Does RxPrep make this more difficult than it needs to be? I'm tired of hemorrhaging money but I suppose I'll pay the $65 for the NABP practice exam too if that'll give me some peace of mind.
