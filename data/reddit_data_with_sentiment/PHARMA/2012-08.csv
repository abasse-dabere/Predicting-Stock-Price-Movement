medicine,What is a polite way to ask for rationale behind decisions in medical care?,"I'm an RN and I recently changed from a community level hospital to a level one trauma center. At my old job there were 3 nurses and one physician for the 8 bed ER and naturally we all knew each other very well.

This was never a problem before, but now that I'm in a bigger hospital it's becoming problematic.  I keep coming across as rude/arrogant without meaning to.

medicine,How to Manage Money in Residency &amp; How Do Your Loans Affect You Today as an Attending?,"Hi Docs,

My wife is a 2nd year OB/GYN resident and I manage the finances for our household.  We both work. We're both 29.  We matched in Honolulu, and it's super-expensive to live here.

I like to plan ahead financially, so I'm wondering if it makes sense to continue to invest for retirement or just save cash in residency because I believe (rightly or wrongly?) we'll able to max out retirement contributions when she reaches the attending level. We pay $740/mo in IBR on med loans, which I feel is significant. 

How much of your income do your med loans hamper you today as attendings? Would you recommend just saving cash for when we move back to the mainland because we can invest aggressively later on with a dual salary, one being that of an attending OB/GYN?

medicine,3rd degree burn question,"Hello guys, I just have a quick question as to why 3rd degree burns from a young age (for example this man was burned at the age of 3: http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/xhie2/21_year_old_man_gives_an_incredibly_candid/) don't heal after several decades.
Maybe it is just a myth, but doesn't the body completely replace all of it's cells within a seven year time span?  Let's stick with this guy (just as an example) - obviously a burn wouldn't mess with someone's genetics, so if the body's natural ""schematics"" or ""blue prints"", if you will, tell the body to grow normally - why wouldn't the new cells be just that, normal?  As that scar tissue he has really from when he was 3 years old?  
Sorry for the total noob question, I guess I just don't understand burns/how our bodies handle such trauma.

medicine,2 part question from someone considering going to med school. 1) Can any MD's that didn't start school until 26/27 give me some advice on how this went? 2) Are there any or does anyone know any MD's that had first gone through pharmacy school and then went to med school?,"Some more info about my situation. At 17 I made a quite uninformed decision to go into pharmacy school. A few years into my schooling I was about to switch to Pre-med but then made another uninformed/optimisitc decision that I would finish pharmacy school and then go to med school. After meeting with pre-med advisors I was informed that it would be quite difficult for me to go to med school afterwards for several reasons, one being that schools may not want to take an in-demand pharmacist out of the profession. Well seeing how there is quite a surplus of pharmacists in the field, this should no longer be an issue with that. I just finished my clinicals and graduated in May and am now seriously considering trying to go to med school. However since I still need to take some more pre-med requisites, take the MCAT, and I wish to work at least a year or so to help pay off some of my student loans I would not be going for another year or two. I am currently 24.

He said that I need to see a specialist and gave me a referral, but they setup an appointment for the last week in September. They cannot see me any sooner, and my doctor said I should just wait till I see them.

Health,Can anybody help me?,"I have a cochlear implant, which I have had since I've been 4 years old. But now I can no longer afford batteries for my implant.  My implant takes 2 batteries every 3 days which is costly to financial health. ( each packet of 6 air zinc batteries cost $7-9 AUD.

I've researched rechargeable batteries but they cost around $300 for one recharge unit that lasts around 24 hours and ( I estimate I need 3 units to swap them .etc) 

I would appreciate it any redditors could help me out as I'm at uni and struggling to make ends meet. 

I sometimes go days where I cannot use my implant and it affects my focus at uni and makes my life quite hard.

I'm happy to answer any questions about the cochlear implant of you have any!

Thanks for any assistance you (redditors) can provide.

Thanks

medicine,Career change: I need some advice!,"Background: I am 25, holding a bachelor's in economics and currently taking prerequisites for medical school (or pharmacy, depending on how you look at it).  

I spent my undergraduate time studying economics, working part-time at a hedge fund and upon graduating, went on full time at the same company.  I worked for about two years post graduating and pursued the CFA (chartered financial analyst).  I took the level one exam (you have to pass three levels - usually takes 3-4 years) in December 2010.  Throughout my time working as a financial analyst, I never felt stimulated, regardless of the amount of money I was working with.  The work quickly became mundane and it wasn't until after I took the first exam for the CFA that I seriously started considering switching careers.  It took about 8 months before I finally quit my job and went back to school.  As I did not have any prerequisites completed due to my previous area of study, I essentially had to go back ""redo"" my undergraduate work.  I am almost finished with the classes and will be by spring 2013, when I am planning on taking the MCAT/PCAT.  

Throughout this process I have been in a long-term, committed relationship and the career change to medicine has caused a lot of arguments as to whether pursuing this career is worth it or not, whether our relationship can withstand it (she is finishing her MA and then will be pursuing a PhD), and the implications it might have with regards to starting a family at some point.  

This has caused me to reconsider pursuing medicine and think about pharmacy as it would be a shorter time commitment before having a steady income again (school + residency in pharm vs. med school) and still be in an area that I am interested in.

I am wondering if anyone has any advice for me.  I am in a tough position because my SO does not want to continue our relationship if I pursue medical school for the fears that it will consume me and leave little to no time for her and our life together.  Is pharmacy a better route or are they the same?  Any advice is very much appreciated.  Thank you all in advance.

edit: I have shadowed 3 physicians, am volunteering at a children's hospital and working in a medical lab.  In addition I am starting a pharmacy technician job to see if I am interested in retail pharmacy.

tl;dr 25 y/o graduated in economics - worked in investments for a few years before deciding to go back to school to prepare for medical school.  In a long-term relationship trying to decide if pharmacy school would be a better route to have both a career in something I am more interested in and have my relationship.

medicine,Was it worth it?,"I've spent the past few hours scouring the internet, learning about Step One, how EC's will/won't help you find residencies/grad work.

All of it seems overwhelming, and I'm just reading this. I'm currently a senior in high school, and I've been shadowing an internal specialist (has his private practice) and it has been enjoyable. Obviously this isn't the whole experience, and I plan to expose myself to more professions (medical or not). 

Going through all these posts, many many people seem bitter and angry (with the time spent in school and effort). It's just making me really question if I want to enter this(these) professions.

So what am I asking, is was the work worth it? The countless hours studying for the MCAT, for Step One, etc. The sleepless nights, the stress, the pain, was it worth it for where you are now? (Or where you're heading).

I really appreciate any time and responses you guys can give me, I'm really interested in hearing more, and learning more. I hope my post makes some sense, and I hope I don't come across as rude.

medicine,Where is the creativity in medicine? (A personal question),"I'm a first year resident in Medicine. I want to be a doctor because I love to teach. I also love to create. But if this 1st year is a model of what the future holds for me, I don't know if my creative mind will be happy. I come home from work just starving for the smallest way to express myself.

Much of the appeal of medicine is being able to diagnose illness. If a patient has stomach pain, you turn on a series of programmed questions, like ""where is it"" or ""how long has it been going on"". If the patient answers them a certain way, it takes you down a path of more questions that allow you to narrow the differential list. There's a lot of gray zone in symptoms and criteria which is where the tough medical education makes the difference. And this variability in diagnosis is often the what allows doctors to call what we do an ""art."" But that variability is miles away from being creative.

So you may be thinking that treatments are where it lies. Procedures can differ drastically based on a doctor's personal style. Unfortunately, these are following increasingly stringent guidelines. As litigation pushes the blame around, every step in the chain from doctor to drug company and insurance company are being ever specific about the recommendations they make or under what conditions payments will be made. Creativity in treatment strategies is minimizing.

In summary, where are the creative outlets in this growing and ever demanding field?",41,12,2012-08-08,PHARMA,0.03669115528464317,0.926323413848877,0.03698543459177017

I do not take them anymore as I ended up being dependent on them to sleep.  Also on a side note my son told me her boyfriend puts benadryl in bread and doses the dog everynight as well.

Edit1- Thank you for all of your replies. I just woke up. I will read through all of them. 

Edit 2- I've gotten some really good advise from you all. I have never used /r/health before. Just to let you know, my relationship with my ex wife is as bad as it can be. She basically stole my son when he was a week old and I gave up everything to stay here and be a good dad.  That being said we do not talk on a personal level and any attempt of me to suggest a different way of raising him is percieved as threat to her. So I always have to pussy foot around things. You really have to be in one of these weird ex-relationships to understand, but you have to consider how you approach things very intelligently in order to maintain some kind of stability.
Having all of your input has greatly helped me approach this subject with some knowledge and reason. My son loves me dearly. I am a wonderful dad to him and fighting her to be that kind of dad has made me even better at being one.  He has agreed to refuse to take these pills, but I am afraid that she will punish him for doing something that I suggested.  She is just that kind of person. If it does escelate I will seek a legal remedy. Thank you all again for your help.",110,216,2012-08-11,PHARMA,0.036878012120723724,0.9150488376617432,0.048073165118694305

But before i start my name is kyle and i am 16 years old, not that would help i am just introducing myself. But i really want to know if someone can relate and help me! i get to the point when i break down and i just can not function. my main anxiety is when it gets to be night, i HATE seeing a day end. as weird as it sounds i want to cry when the sun goes down. (yes i sound like a wuss) but please spare me the rude comments i just cant take this sadness anymore. i mean sometimes i think if it was from my dad leaving me or im just a really sad person. i did go to a doctors to talk but she really did not have the capability to put me on meds..my point is stupid little things can set me off so fast...i cant even leave the house without my mom, i get reeaaally bad home sickness..and it can be just an hour out or 15 min down the street! i have no idea what is wrong with me. i am atheist but its time like this when praying seems nice. but ever since that bible camp 6 months ago i cant leave my house. it was a 4 day program and i cried the first night. (no one saw me or heard me) i called my mom telling me to get me but she would not come and get me cause it was 4 hours away. but the main reason i wanted to leave was because i use to be fat and most kids picked on me there. well at this point i really just stay in my room or go and run and thats what i do all day everyday because i do not hang with anyone or anywhere but my house. i need help. really badly! if someone can talk to me i am hoping it can calm me down until i get to a doctor.

Health,What would you tell someone to keep them from smoking cigarettes? I'll take anything.,"I am not a ""smoker,"" but a lot of my friends smoke, so I started having one at a party now and then while I drink. I promised myself I'll never buy a pack and am very confident that I'll stay true to that promise. However, I am noticing that I've made a habit of ""bumming cigs"" more often. Tonight I just realized I had two today and I am not okay with that. I am not addicted. I do not have a very addictive personality and if I make a conscious effort to stop, I'm not bad at it. So it isn't nicotine that's getting me (never craved a cigarette in my life) but simply the habit. I've gotten used to taking them when offered or sometimes asking for one, and I just lose track. It's like potato chips.

Anyway, personally, I am determined to make it through my life as a non-smoker, so I want you to give me stories, scary facts, or just friendly advice to help give me the extra push to watch myself.

This would be greatly appreciated!

medicine,"Depression, Sleep Ruining Chances of Becoming a Doctor (X-post from r/medicalschool","I’m not really sure what to do with myself. I am currently a fourth year medical student who should be getting my application ready to apply for residencies. Instead, I find myself languishing the days away in bed or in front of my computer. Throughout all of medical school, I have been struggling with major depression on top of a sleep disorder, and that has been difficult enough. But there are also weeks at a time, that occur every so often, when symptoms are more pronounced, and it becomes arduous and exhausting to even arrive on time at my clinical sites.

Currently, I am on my anesthesia rotation. This is an important rotation for me, because anesthesia is what I hope to do.  However, due to these problems, I’ve missed quite a number of days. I was hoping to use this as an opportunity to get some letters of recommendation, but I’ve squandered it. 

So not only do I feel like I have screwed myself over even as far as applications go, but I have also become really worried about the prospect of intern year. I know that it will be very demanding, and it will be impossible for me to fulfill those responsibilities it at this rate.

I’ve talked with student affairs in the past; they seem mostly interested in confirming that I am not suicidal (I’m not) and then refer me to a psychiatrist. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for 2 years now, and various medications have not really brought about much change in any of my symptoms yet. So I am not sure where else to turn. The idea of taking time off has been suggested, but since I need to be using this time to apply for residencies, this may be the worst possible time to take a leave of absence. Additionally, I’m not sure what taking time off would accomplish.

I guess my questions are: Is it impossible for me to be or even become a doctor? Have I kissed my chances at having an acceptable application goodbye? Has anyone else dealt with major depression or sleep disorders through medical school? How did they challenge you, and what helped you?

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their advice and concern, and I want to apologize for not responding sooner. I was able to talk with student affairs and the anesthesia clerkship director; I have moved some rotations around in my schedule to allow for some time off without having to take an actual medical leave (but the option is there should I need it). Additionally, I was offered some make-up dates for anesthesia, and the clerkship director is keeping these issues between us. I have to say, everything has worked out better than I thought it would. I was surprised at the understanding that everyone showed. Still, I have to focus on getting better--I've agreed to meet with a therapist on a regular basis (something I'd not been doing before) and I have a new appointment with a psychiatrist to adjust my meds.

Again, thanks for all your support.",24,36,2012-08-13,PHARMA,0.08627887815237045,0.883793830871582,0.029927285388112068
medicine,"As a US-educated physician who was deeply in debt after medical school, how would you feel if med school was made free of charge?","There are about 68,000 medical school students in the US. Tuition and fees vary a lot, but in Texas it's about $18,000 per year, so using that as a baseline, paying a stipend of $18,000 per year to each student would only cost $4.9 billion per year. Of course, most of the time people are given allowances for room and board too, which in Texas adds another $22,000, so the total is $40,000 per year. A stipend covering that cost would still only cost about $11 billion per year.

Assuming we were not strapped for cash at the moment, $11 billion is next to nothing compared to the entire US federal budget. We spend $18 billion per year on NASA. We're talking about cutting the defense budget by $55 billion a year for the next ten years, so $11 billion per year is easily doable.

Here's the problem: if you're a 3rd or 4th year right now, and then a bill gets passed in a couple of years that makes med school free, aren't you going to be a little pissed off? Or even if you're an intern or just made resident, I would think you'd still not be too happy about that, unless there were something retroactive in there to help you out with your debt too.

But I don't know, I'm not a physician and not in med school, it's just something I've been wondering about since med school is free in so many countries, and people are talking about making it free in the US as a solution to a possible doctor shortage.",77,33,2012-08-13,PHARMA,0.03313608467578888,0.9242913722991943,0.04257255047559738

Health,My girlfriend has a super-healthy lifestyle and gets sick all the time.  I'm a mascot for poor choices and rarely get a cold.  What's the deal?,"My girlfriend eats fresh and healthy foods in a varied diet, lots of vegetables, the only grains she consumes are whole, gets at least 30 minutes of outdoor exercise every day, nonsmoker, and is usually in bed by midnight for eight hours of solid sleep.  She's very clean, not obsessively so, but clean house/linens/clothes/plenty of showers.  She does drink more alcohol than most people I know, not sure what a good frame of reference is but last night she probably had four glasses of wine over the course of the evening, which is pretty usual whether or not I'm there. 

She is very frequently sick- stomach upsets, sinus and throat infections, low-grade fevers, seems to catch pretty much every cold that comes through. 

Meanwhile, I eat total garbage- whole days where I'll consume nothing but protein bars or peanut butter sandwiches, drink like 2L of caffeinated sodas or energy drinks a day, work an extremely high stress job and pull allnighters a couple of times a month.  I eat a lot of candy.  A couple of times a week I'll go to fast food restaurants, where I tend to get salads or other ""healthy-ish-but-not-really"" choices.  I don't cook, just microwave dinners.  When I think about it I try to work extra fiber into my diet, but I rarely think about it.  I smoke 4-5 cigarettes a day, though I'm trying to make the switch to an electronic cigarette.  My pedometer says I am sedentary.  I really only clean myself/clothes/house when other people will see them.  My weight is stable, I feel OK, have plenty of strength and not great but sufficient endurance for eg. all-day yard projects, and get mild colds maybe twice a year- nothing more serious other than a broken molar which isn't bothering me but should probably get pulled.  It's been like that for 1.5 years.

Only other factors I can think of are that I don't drink, and don't consume red meat or pork and almost no dairy. 

I guess the question is WTF?  I'm worried about her, and it's causing problems in our relationship because coming over to care for her with chicken soup and Advil and a romantic comedy is a little tiresome when you do it a couple of times every month.  Her whole family seems to think it's pretty normal, I'm not sure how often they get sick.

Meanwhile, I know my choices need to change, but what am I doing right?  Have I fully saturated myself in Vit. C &amp; B-complexes?  Trained my body to run on crap?  ...or am I Wolverine?",29,17,2012-08-15,PHARMA,0.134229838848114,0.8442709445953369,0.02149917371571064

Health,"My mother need a bone marrow transplant and should go to Germany, I need some information.","First, I'm sorry if its the wrong subreddit, *if I should post this somewhere else just tell me*. I tried to search but couldn't figure out were should I post.


**The story**: My mother have Acute myeloid leukemia (type M4) for about 9 months now. He had an Autologous Bone marrow transplant 4 months ago, which failed (blasts were back after transplant) and now her condition is worsening. Her doctor wants to do another transplant but this time with a donor (Allogeneic), but my mother doesn't have a brother or sister, only half siblings which are not matches.

After some searching and medical process we found a donor match for her which is in Germany and we are in a third world country in middle east. the costs of bringing the donor's cells is very high (about 40,000 euro) and it takes 3-5 months which her doctor thinks might be too long. (she is currently on Chemo).

The doctor suggest we take her to Germany (he talked about some hospital in the city of Wiesbaden) it would cost around 80,000-100,000 euros but it all would be done in 2 weeks. He believes that if we can afford it, it's the better option.

**So** I tried to search about the hospitals, or other info about a medical trip to Germany but I don't understand German and I can't find anything useful.

**What I need:** If anyone can help me with some information, about the cancer related hospitals, Bone marrow banks, doing the transplant in Germany or England (I have relatives in England), organizations that might help, the way we can reduce the costs and any other helpful advice I would be greatly thankful.",16,35,2012-08-16,PHARMA,0.03418373689055443,0.9185078144073486,0.04730842262506485

Health,Felt the most excruciating pain of my life.,"So, I had a holiday today and overslept. When I got up, it was fine but soon my head started paining. Not in a normal way, but only one side (left) . My eyes teared up, became red, my nose started running. It felt as if someone had shot me in the head and then driven a shovel through it. It just reduced after 4 hours where I felt I would die. I'm going to a doctor in the evening, but seriously, has anyone experienced these?
I've broken bones, had skin ripped and burnt but never felt anything as bad as this.


EDIT: Thanks for the concern guys. I did go to a doctor, he checked me out, asked if I had these headaches in the past to which I said no. He then prescribed paracetemol and said that if this happens again, he'll schedule me for a CT Scan, hopefully it won't. As for why I didn't call 911 or 999 in my case was that I wasn't thinking straight, I thought it was a normal headache when suddenly it exploded in pain and I lost the ability to think clearly.

Health,Thyroid-less mother in peril.,"My mother has lived her youth with a Hyper Thyroid, Depression and Ulcerative Colitis (claims the latter was healed by the hands of God.) She got her thyroid removed about 10 years ago and she is about 46 years old now. My family can't afford health insurance so we pay for all her medication cash, very expensive stuff. 

I am really concerned about her health. She always complains about her well being. Never has energy, she is dead if she exerts herself for more than four hours. Wakes up will extreme stomach aches and always has the most intense case of gas that I have seen in my life.

I talked to my male cousin which got his thyroid removed (runs on my mothers side of the family) about this and said he never feels that way. This left me wondering about her possibly doing something incorrect. I know she only eats about 1-2 small meals a day. The rest is either Mexican sweet bread, popcorn, kettle korn, candy, bagels, bread, ice cream, donuts, tortillas, chips with hot sauce and other various Sonoran snacks (my mom is Mexican.) Guaranteed she never makes it to 2000 calories a day. She also hasn't exercised actively since she was under 20 years old. She is not overweight or obese in any way so I believe this is why she continues this life style. What blows my mind is that instead of being proactive, she prays for her well being and only reads religious publications. She constantly talks bad about Science and supports her view with ignorant claims. 

Tell me Reddit, what do you do with somebody that is so deep in the gutter? I am a person of logic so it leaves me in awe seeing somebody let this happen to themselves. I spent two years of my youth sitting in a chair, not exercising and barely eating and saw my health rapidly decline. I took a step back and found the problem. Now I force myself to eat as much as possible everyday even though my appetite is shot (I am depressed also.) I need to exercise at least once a week or else my body starts to ache. I have a feeling I am going to have to be there for the time my parents failed to take care of their own health :(

Health,I think I have something wrong with my metabolism? Not sure what to call this.,"I have always had a fast metabolism. I'm 23, 5'1"" and about 105lbs. When I was 18 or so I started having issues. If I wouldn't eat enough during the day. (Say I just got too busy and didn't think about it or wasn't hungry) I would start dry heaving and breaking out into an instant sweat that night. That issue has continued and become somewhat more common as the years go on. This isn't normally a huge issue as I eat pretty well, but when I'm sick and don't want food, it causes a huge problem. When I get sick and dry heave, it takes about a day before I can eat normally again. I have to eat little bits of food here and there and slowly build my hunger back up until I feel okay again.

Recently it has taken the next step up. I can go from being not hungry and completely content to feeling like I haven't eaten in days. There's no in between from feeling fine and being shaky, feeling weak, and needing food that second. I eat, and I'm fine. 

Yesterday I felt fine, ate regularly and this morning I woke up feeling extremely hungry, yet nauseous. I ate a piece of dry toast on my way to class to help ease the nausea and got down almost a whole bagel with cream cheese when I got back. Since then my hunger has come back like crazy and I've eaten a full bag of Doritos, 2 grilled chicken salads, an ice cream bar, some mashed potatoes, and a candy bar. I usually eat quite a few small meals throughout the day because I get full quickly. But even now I'm already hungry again.

Basically, this is a long winded way of asking if anyone else has this issue? It doesn't seem normal to me at all but I can't seem to find anything online that sounds like the issues I have. Is it just a crazy fast metabolism or could there be something more going on?",7,9,2012-08-19,PHARMA,0.15675562620162964,0.8086003661155701,0.0346439965069294

I also hear people claim that they have a super immune system.  I'm sure some people do have strong immune systems, but the way some of these people talk, its as if they claim they can never get sick.

I'm not looking for advice or how to do this.  I do; however, want to know if this claim is actually true.  I know that certain minerals do help support the immune system, but  I don't think these would strengthen the immune system.

Question: Can an individual strengthen their immune system naturally without the immune system coming into contact with a pathogen?

Health,Reddit had my first session with a psychiatrist today and I've figured out what's wrong with the American health system.,"So had my first psychiatrist session with a Harvard trained psychiatrist and it was not what I expected.

The appointment was supposed to be 30 min but was actually 10.  He sits me down in his office with his laptop in front of him and asks me a few superficial questions such as what am I there for, how many siblings do I ahve, etc.  He does this all while reading the laptop, barely making eye contact. Also, there were like minute long pauses between him asking me each question.  It was super awkward silence.  He could have been looking at porn for all I know.

I asked him to help me cure my issue permanently and what sort of plan or therapy that would take.  He literally just ignores my questions and says these are the 2 medicines I want you to start taking. He writes me a prescription then and there, doesn't tell me the side effects or how these will help me.  His assistant then escorts me out the door.  

Is this what a psychiatrist does?  This guy came recommended by my doctor, had good yelp reviews, and a degree from Harvard. However, he didn't even discuss trying to solve my issue, or ask any real questions.  He literally just prescribed me some pills and sent me on my merry way saying to check back in a month.  WTF is wrong with the US when our medical system is just a bunch of pill subscribers?!?!  Is this all people who go to therapy really want, to be given a bunch of happy drugs??!?!

Health,"Okay, so I had low testosterone ...","tl;dr - testosterone and apnea treatments has led to super low appetite and rapid weight loss.  Is this normal?

I mean below acceptable levels.  On top of that I have a fairly big case of sleep apnea.  I've been to the doctor, I'm on a CPAP machine for the apnea, and the endo has me on Androgel for the testosterone.  And I feel about ten years younger (I'm 34) than I did a few short weeks ago ...

I'd also gained a buttload of weight, thanks to the apnea, testosterone, and hypothyroidism (also being treated with synthroid) and in the past three weeks I've dropped about 20 pounds without really having to try.

My issue is a complete lack of appetite ... I barely eat anything during the day when I used to eat full meals.  I can barely stomach a whole bagel for breakfast, I can eat a small pack of ramen for lunch and a few bites of dinner.  My stomach still rumbles, but I don't feel like eating.

Is this normal when on testosterone treatment?  I don't want to lose weight the wrong way just to have it pile back on.

Health,Had a wisdom tooth out and have been taking hydrocodone acetaminophen 5-500 for pain every 6-8ish hours for the past few days as recommended by my dentist and directed on the bottle. I think I may be developing an immunity?,"I've been on the generic medication for five days, taking about three pills a day as well as icing my face. I'm also taking penicillin every eight hours. When I first started taking it, it was working well and set the pain to a mild level. My face has been swelling a little bit and the medication does not seem to be working. I'm still in a considerable amount of pain once forty minutes to an hour goes by after taking the pill. 

The bone is supposed to take six weeks to heal. 

My wisdom tooth was removed by drilling and pulling, as well as separating the roots. It wasn't done by an oral surgeon but by my dentist, so no anesthetics or stitches were used. The socket and my surrounding teeth hurt to the point where I want to cry, and I usually take pain really well. 

I'm afraid that I'm developing an immunity to the medication and I don't know what to do. I obviously can't double up my dosages because that would probably destroy my liver. Should I suck it up and stop taking it for a while? Request a different pain killer? Any suggestions on how to handle the pain or things not to do?",13,7,2012-08-25,PHARMA,0.08969122171401978,0.8807405233383179,0.02956821769475937
Health,I broke down to my bosses wife.,"Hey my name is Russ and I'm a male bulimic. Last night I was a at friends wedding and was speaking to my bosses family enjoying a few beers and just socializing, I kept going back and to from the bathroom and was there a while most times at first people guess your doing business.

I came out of the cubical and there was a random guy just standing there and ask me if I was ok as a lady sent him in to check, I walked out the bathroom and though the glass door I saw her staring at me. I went over to her and she went I know what your doing and whispered in my ear ""Your a male bulimic"". After what seemed like a long pause I looked at her and with watery eyes and dropped my head onto her shoulder and cried.

We went out into the beer sat on a bench out of the way I know everyone was looking and wondering but I blocked it and admitted everything.

I have yellow nail's, Red knuckles, gum bleeding, no energy, I have trouble remembering, I get violently cold.

My Parents where also at this gathering but as I stopped at my bosses house without them they didn't question it. But I am scared to go downstairs as I know they want to confront but about what happened and why I broke down. So I have confined myself to my room with my headphones and many bottles of water :(",19,101,2012-08-26,PHARMA,0.12392297387123108,0.849590539932251,0.026486486196517944

Health,Embarrassing anal problem,"I have an anal fissure that I have been applying an ointment to for the last 30 days. Tomorrow is my last day, but I don't think it has healed. I got a whole tube of this stuff, but the prescription says not to use for more than 30 days. Thus, I feel compelled to go back into the clinic. The first time I went into one of those walk in places just because its faster. The doctor took one look down there and instantly said anal fissure. 

However, the real reason I went to begin with was that I was pokin around down there and hurt myself. The next day i went to the bathroom and felt a tearing sensation followed by a lot of blood. After work i went to the clinic. I didn't tell the doctor the real reason for it. I just said hard bowel movement. I didn't see blood until the bowel movement, but it was probably from you know what. Needless to say, is it possible that something else is entirely wrong? I know that a fissure can go along the wall of the anus. Yet the actual sore appears on the outside of the anus. I feel like the only way to know for sure is for them to go actually look inside the anus, but the first time I went the doctor just look on the outside.

I'm not sure what do at this point. It does not bleed. I have only seen trace amounts of blood on the toilet paper, which is probably from wiping too hard. Sometimes, it does not hurt. Other times I can feel like a slight itchiness and burning. Its burning today but I think I got too much soap down there ( I have to clean with soap and water before applying the ointment).

Do I have to tell the doctor exactly what i did? Or all anal fissures the same? Will they be able to diagnose by looking further into the anus?

EDIT. I'm going back to the clinic tomorrow to see the same guy who I saw the first time. I'm going to have to tell the truth, although now I feel like complete crap. I guess I deserve it. My only fear now is that I am supposed to be moving out of the country in November. What am I supposed to do if its a chronic thing? How serious is the surgery? I do have insurance. 

Edit 2. I went back to the physician i saw first on Monday. I told him what happened. Your right, they dont care. Anyways, he said it didn't matter how a fissure is caused. Other than it just happens. But he said he didnt have the tools to look in there so he didn't. I went to a primary care Doctor today. He looked about 4-5 inches inside the anus. And he said I don't even have an anal fissure. There was no pain at all when he went digging around in there. The best he could summarize was that I have anal pruritus which is basically anal itching. He found some slight tears, but he described them as healing from an anal fissure..",21,31,2012-08-26,PHARMA,0.11551558971405029,0.8590604066848755,0.025423968210816383

medicine,"healthcare providers of meddit - how do you deal with family members who like to ""play doctor""?","No one else in my family is a physician, but everyone reads wikipedia or WebMD, so they like to think that they can simply pick up what took me 8 years of training to learn in a mere minutes.

They are forever buying new supplements (they're natural!!) on the internet, or even swapping prescription medications with one another.  While I don't prescribe things for family members besides the odd acne cream or emergency inhaler, they often come to me with medical questions.  My advice is generally to talk to their own doctors, except when it comes to my own field.

I could see that my grandma's PCP was overmedicating her with benzos and TCAs (at grandma's request).  I attempted to get her to wean down on the benzos after letting her PCP know, because she's a fall risk and brittle as can be.  Managed to get her to half her dose of benzos before I had to leave town.  She then started to complain of dizziness again (code for ""anxious"" in our somaticizing culture), so my dad bought some weird ergotamine drug from Asia through my aunt.  Of course that made things worse, and she became delirious.  

Got a call from mom asking if it was normal for old people to start seeing things or getting days and nights confused.  They ignored my recommendation to seek medical attention.  My helpful aunt decided to mail some Ambien(!) to help grandma get some sleep.  

I am seriously at wits' end here.  It's one thing to screw around with your own meds, but to experiment on my grandmother is another thing.  I feel incredibly helpless being a thousand miles away (for residency) and won't be able to return home again to straighten things out for at least another month.

Health,Does anyone else get uncontrollable dizzy spells which are similar to falling asleep in boring meetings?,"I've noticed this for several years now.

I should start by stating that I'm a 26/m and I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was very little. I get normally 6.5-8 hours of sleep on a regular work night. I'm in the software engineering field now, and anytime I'm in a meeting at work or especially during intense training, I get stuck in these almost trance-like states that I find very hard to snap out of.

I've noticed that it happens when someone is training me and dumping lots of new information on me - so much that it overwhelms me. It also happens during really boring presentations that aren't very captivating. It's hard to describe, but I'll be sitting there listening to someone drone on about something I'm not very interested in and all of a sudden, out of my control, my vision blurs and I have to fight falling asleep with head-bobbing - all while trying to not get caught / not look disrespectful to the teacher/trainer.

I feel ashamed that people think I'm disrespectful for allowing myself into this state, but I have no idea why it's happening and how to force myself away from ever entering it. This was such a big problem at my old job, that I would fall asleep constantly even when trying to consciously force myself to stay awake - I ended up being one of the first to be laid off when cuts came around.

I want to make it clear that even during training that I'm desperately trying to force myself to concentrate on staying attentive, I still get caught in this terrible trance. My body feels lightweight and my vision fluctuates from blurring and clearing up as I fight to stay awake.
