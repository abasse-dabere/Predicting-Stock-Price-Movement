medicine,Surgeon here: started dating a fellow staff member and suddenly all the nurses hate me...why does this happen?,"So some background - I'm a female orthopod who started working at a new hospital about a year ago. At my previous workplace, I had great relationships with all the nurses - I'd done my residency there and the nurses really had my back during many a bad day in the OR. It was great to have female friends that could relate to me - we often spent time together after work and I had a wonderful working relationship with them as well. I am in fact still close to many of them, despite moving across the country.

Fast forward to my new job - I moved to be closer to family and am really enjoying my work. After being single for quite a while, I've met someone in the ortho department. It's a bit controversial as the old adage ""don't s**t where you eat"" is of course something to think about. However, it's been about 6 months now and things have been going well. Our chief of surgery is aware, as we had to disclose and he has no issues with it.

However, the nursing staff do seem to have issues. Originally the nurses were all very professional and nice when I first started working at this new hospital. However, a few months after I started dating my current beau, we were spotted out about town by a few of the nurses and the news quickly spread about our relationship. Ever since then, I've found their to be much more difficulty with the nursing staff. Many have made snarky comments and even downright unprofessional comments about our relationship. Most aren't quite so outright, but seem to be very cold and harsh towards me, despite having previously great interactions before the news got out. My boyfriend is a relatively new hire here too and he hasn't dated any of the nurses or caused any drama to explain this attitude towards me - in fact all the nurses seem to adore him and are always fighting over who gets to work in his OR. 

This is really bumming me out. I'm the only female orthopod here and many of the other female surgeons here are much older than me. At my old centre, my friendships with the female nursing staff really made my days a bit brighter but here I find working with some of the more cold nurses can really make a long day feel even longer. I've tried to reach out, but it feels pretty awkward at times when they are just so uninterested in getting to know me.

I know it's very much a first world problem, but I guess it bothers me enough. I can rationalize that maybe they're bitter that the ""eligible bachelor"" is now off the market but at the same time we're all adults here and I'd like to think we're past that! I have the utmost respect for my nursing colleagues and would really like to have at the very least a less strained professional relationship.

Any advice?",158,246,2016-11-04,PHARMA,0.11733709275722504,0.8472248315811157,0.03543800488114357

medicine,Taking blood distal to an AV fistula?,"Hi all,

Quick question:
I remember being told in medical school that we can't take blood or cannulate an arm that has a working AV fistula on it. I understand why we shouldn't cannulate and deliver drugs to it, but why can we not take blood from it?

We have a patient at the moment who has pretty poor IV access and we're struggling to get bloods off her. She has an AV fistula - right bracio-cephalic. The other ICU doc and nurses all told me I can't take blood from her hand (about 8 inches away from the fistula), but nobody could give me the reason as to why not. Does anyone know what happens? Just out of curiosity? The poor lady's left arm is not in good shape at the moment, and she's probably looking at a central line soon. 

Edit: thanks for all the replies guys. Lots of you are suggesting alternative routes. I'm practicing in Ireland, and while it's great we have free healthcare, it's not as efficient as private systems in the US. PICC line's take about 5-6 days to get done. We don't have midlines. Arterial lines = must be in HDU/ICU. Essentially when it comes to access, if you can't place the type of line yourself, you don't even bother trying to order it. Also, I'm more so asking because I'm curious, we've actually already put in a CVC.

medicine,Nursling trying to balance skepticism and keeping an open mind with alternative ideas?,"I'm 3 months in my BSN. I love medicine- I love getting nosy with med students and pharm students about what they're learning. I like reading research and studies- I just really enjoy exploring medicine. 

I have questions, and no one I feel 100% confident to ask. 

I've found myself here, in a challenging place, because I come from a family of alternative medicine. I was not vaccinated until I was 18 at my own choice. I went to a chiropractor who used AK, who I no longer see, again by choice. As I've learned more about the body and medicine, I completely rejected alternative medicine, probably too drastically as a fuel to a rebellious search for identity- you know how it is in college. 

Recently, though, as of today I guess, I noticed I have begun to swing back the other way, not consciously though. Here's my problem, and I really hope this finds people who are experienced in medicine and think ""outside of the textbook"".

Part of me sees alternative medicine as a desperation. When medicine says there is no cure, alternative medicine insists there is, and views mainstream medicine and predatory and hive-minded. But, part of me agrees with this. Now, you could never convince me of the power of crystals, and I will not see an AK chiropractor ever again unless studies can truly support it someday, somehow, I don't know, I'd like to remain open minded, but for today no way. But I've seen enough to convince me there is merit to acupuncture, and I find myself knee deep in information on nutrition that is seriously NOT supported in my nursing texts.

Sadly, I cannot admit my ""personal hobby-like"" exploration of nutrition has been purely reading study after study. I also listen to mass-testimony. It seems even in the body-building world, a general rule is net cal in and net cal out, with a set amount of protein, and then you can set the rest of your macros to whatever you want (and they all use science to achieve the same body compositions). I see nothing harmful in following high fat diets. But somehow, this is considered ""quack"" nutrition, and I've had several professors (and fellow students) launch into the dangers on high fat and low carb diets - I mean if you're diabetic, don't do keto because you could die, but not everyone is diabetic. 

So I'm sitting here thinking, who is telling you this? And why is everyone in the class so quick to shoot down unconventional ideas? Would it not be more reasonable to find many studies that lead you to conclude keto or atkins is dangerous, rather than writing it off as BS just because it doesn't correlate with a textbook? 

I worry specifically about nutrition because it seems there's a lot of lobbying going on, and when I stare at charts insisting people eat a certain amount of ""grains and dairy"" I wonder what percent of that is science, and what percent of that is cereal companies. And you could have 100 dietitians sitting in a room all in agreement, but didn't all those dietitians learn from the same textbook? 

I'm presented with an over-reaching worry that drug companies could be doing the same to my nursing textbooks, and I'm caught in a storm of paranoia that seems a little too similar to my parents paranoia over vaccines. It's not helpful I lack practical experience or clinical reasoning skills that would allow me to read research with a critical eye. I still read for the hell of it, but with the understanding that I'm not educated enough to fully read into dense research.

I know I'm naive and that's what frustrates me. I don't want to blindly accept alternative ideas, but I don't want to blindly reject them either. Moving forward, I want to feel confident I will eventually understand all this information better, but right now I feel skeptical of anything I'm told, from everywhere, and it's exhausting and making it difficult to learn. 

Sorry this post is so long. How do I find confidence in what I'm learning?",46,35,2016-11-08,PHARMA,0.04259445145726204,0.9269617199897766,0.030443841591477394

B. The actual content of the exam has not changed it will still be the same material. The only difference is its not adaptive. So easy, hard, ridiculous questions, they're all weighted the same.

C. The first test had a 10 minute break. This new 6 hour test you still only have a 10 minute break. THEY ARE WORKING ON TRYING TO GET THIS CHANGED. Cuz that's just fucking bonkers

medicine,Tips on how to read one journal article a day - strategies,"I am a firm believer in continuous education in the strictest sense. I have a FOAMed workflow that I have finished daily for a year, see below. Now I want to add a daily journal article into the mix. I believe the key to doing this kind of daily education is to eliminate decision fatigue. I know for a fact that I wont stick with it, if I have to pick an article myself. It has to be automatic, a checkbox on my list. I don't think I am alone in this. To summarize, what I need is to be sent a interesting, quality, new-ish article everyday that covers general medicine topics.

Has anyone here found a solution that fits the above description?
I have tried to use [qxmd](https://www.readbyqxmd.com/featured) but they don't remove articles you have already read, so the list is endless. 


Regarding my FOAMed solution. I aggregate blogs to [feedly](http://feedly.com/i/my) and use [feedity](https://feedity.com) to get non-RSS content into feedly (such as radiopaedia case of the day). This solution makes it so that all the FOAM blogs show up in one place (feedly), update automatically every time a new blog post is written and sync across all devices. This is also free. As you can see, there is no decision fatigue, all I have to do is open the app. I read everything that comes into feedly, some things I skim (e.g. rapid sequence intubation) and other things I read at a deeper level. But the point is, I have one constant rule; finish reading every blog in feedly everyday. It is well defined and has a non-ambiguous end point. I would never be able to keep this up if I had to decide which blogs to read, decide to go to each one and check if there was a new update and finally have to decide what constitutes being done for the day. I'm looking for a similar solution for peer reviewed medical journal articles.

EDIT: What about a weekly journal club? Does anyone know of a platform for MDs/DOs to discuss one single article weekly, where some of the leg-work has been done before hand to facilitate discussion (e.g. literature review, comparative articles, discussion questions).

medicine,Giving food to patients unsupervised - are the patients at risk due to my colleague's irresponsibility?,"Dear all,

I am posting this as a third year MBBS student currently going through the clinical / ward rotations while attached to several different hospitals. I have recently came across something particularly worrying when I was interviewing a few patients in the wards. A colleague / coursemate of mine who has been allocated to the same group as I am, and whom I shall refer to as Mr. F, has been going round the wards offering random snacks he purchased to the patients he encounters, all without checking the patient files, or consulting the staff nurses / dietitian / physician.

He claims that he is offering the snacks to the patients to develop rapport, and he claims that it helps to win favour from the patients, thus facilitating the history taking process (patient becomes more willing to talk / open up). According to his logic, as long as the patients are happy, everything is fine. He is even promoting his approach to my other colleagues, expecting my other colleagues to do the same.

His actions immediately triggered a blaring siren in my mind when I first heard about it. I immediately quipped back and raised the possibility of anaphylaxis (allergy), aspiration pneumonia (patient may have a surgery scheduled very soon), food poisoning (who knows where he got the snacks, chips, fries, cookies, etc. from). However, he may have immediately turned a deaf ear to my remarks. One or two other colleagues of mine also expressed their concern about his behaviour, stating the possibility of screwing up test results (e.g. FBG), and some patients may be under salt and fluids restriction (CCF). However, this dimwit is adamant that ""as long as the patient is happy, everything is fine"". He even challenged us by saying that none of the patients he has given food to / shared food with has died due to his actions.

I was informed that his behaviour of giving / sharing food unsupervised as a medical student has started since less than a week ago.

Dear Redditors of /r/medicine, am I overreacting in this situation? Given that nothing significant has happened in the past few days, is it actually safe to do so, or is his behaviour a ticking time bomb inviting a malpractice lawsuit? I am seriously concerned that his behaviour might harm a patient, and I am considering reporting his behaviour to our supervisors. However, I am now seeking the advice of the experts in /r/medicine before doing so, just in case my worries were excessive and unnecessary. Better be safe than sorry - that is what I thought.

***EDIT***: Oh wow, thanks for all the responses. I did not expect many people to reply, to be honest. I'm glad that my worries are not completely unfounded. Our direct supervisors will not be available in the next few days, so I might send them a mail and discuss this again when I meet them next time (they seldom check their mails). In the meantime, as much as I hate it, I'll talk to this [Mr. F](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fuckwad) again so he does not put the patients safety at risk.

For those who are curious about what types of food he has handed to the patients, refer to the non-exhaustive list below to know what I have found out. I believe the list will continue to grow as I ask around a little more.

* Chocolates (Hershey's &amp; Ferrero Rocher) - think of nut allergies!
* Steamed buns (may contain various fillings)
* Buns with sweet azuki bean paste (Japanese anpan)
* Leftover fries from his McDonalds lunch set
* Sweets &amp; candies of various types
* Sausage bread
* Cream crackers

***EDIT 2***: My other colleague tried to talk to him about this again. The response was ""Chill the fuck down man, why raise a big fuss over somethin' like this?

medicine,Hypertensive emergency/urgency? How do you manage it personally?,"Hi there I'm an intern rotating through medicine, on my first NF rotation.

I get a lot of calls about hypertensive urgencies (asymptomatic htn &gt;180/&gt;120).

What drugs are your general go-tos? What is your usual algorithmic approach on NF to these calls?

Usually senior NF is with me, and I would ask them, and they would tell me to push either labetalol and hydralazine. My experience with labetalol so far is that it does not seem to make a lot of BPs budge within about 3 hours, though hydralazine has felt more effective, but the BP drop tends to be too large.

Are there any official guidelines to this thing? Are there any oral meds you tend to go for?

I guess my confusion comes from each resident I meet approaching it differently (giving IV labetalol, some give IV hydralazine, some give PO labetalol, some give captopril), and I'm not sure in which order to attempt these drugs. Also, how long should I wait before adding on a second agent or retrying the last??


And lastly, I sometimes get calls for BPs from 150s systolic to 170s systolic. I usually leave it alone if the patient is asymptomatic. Is that the right approach??

Any advice? What do you seasoned doctors do? Any reference guidelines/articles you found useful?

medicine,What do you think about plans to reform healthcare under a Trump Presidency?,"My apologies for linking to WaPo; if you have trouble reading the article, I recommend opening ""incognito mode"" on Chrome or ""inprivate browsing"" on internet explorer to get around the paywall.

[Here's an article summarizing some of the GOP plans to reform healthcare in the event that ACA is repealed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/06/22/republicans-have-a-plan-to-replace-obamacare-and-its-costs-are-unclear/)

Personally, I find the whole GOP argument against ACA asinine, as Obamacare started life as RomneyCare which was a GOP-designed free-market solution for providing universal health coverage.  Right now, I think many American agree with the sentiment that Congress is more interested in playing political football than getting any real work done.

That said, ACA is not accomplishing it's goal of decreasing premium costs.  I can't imagine how that would be possible, unless the government made the system ""opt-out"" instead of the current ""opt-in.""  The average American is just too lazy* even to claim free money for health insurance so the only ones motivated to do so are unsurprisingly those that actually need insurance--the unhealthy!

One proposal to circumvent the ""death spiral"" of premium increases that really intrigues me is the plan to automatically enroll taxpayers in a catastrophic policy with premiums equal to the cost of subsidies if they fail to make another selection.  It's funny how the discussion about a public option has gone full circle back to a ""public option"" (obviously the default plan is going to be a private one, but still).

It's clear that the GOP also recognizes the popularity of guaranteed issue, the removal of annual and lifetime caps to spending, and tax subsidies among member of the voting public.  There's no way they can achieve a wholesale repeal of Obamacare without angering their constituency (who I am beginning to suspect are too uninformed to realize that the individual mandate they hate is part of the same law as the first three policies I listed).  Simply repealing the individual mandate would lead to the acceleration of the ""death spiral"" by causing even more healthy purchasers to abandon plans which would leave only the sickest and least profitable customers.  Maybe the GOP is actually trying to implode the system in order to earn the political coin needed for repeal of the popular parts of the legislation?  I would not put it past them.  Maybe they'll even kick down EMTALA and we'll start from square one?

Regardless of whether you voted or who you voted for, what do you want or expect to see happen to health policy now that Trump is president?

*Everyone is hung up on this word ""lazy.""  I'm a pinko-commie who believes in Universal Healthcare for all, but I calls 'em as I sees 'em.  Lazy is the best word to describe someone who refuses to fill out a 1040-EZ for free online and fails to enroll for government subsidized health insurance using that information (which is electronically imported!).  Lazy is refusing to fill out a single page application for free county-funded insurance when a case manager is willing to sit with you one-on-one and assist.  Human nature is lazy, though, so we should consider it when building a healthcare system.

Ultimately, the real fault rests on our spineless government representatives who can't even agree on a plan that mostly exists to enrich the coffers of the Health Insurers and Pharmaceuticals/Device Makers but as a side effect provided improved coverage for millions of Americans.  The GOP are especially at fault because, even though they got pretty much every concession they lobbied for, they still pitched a hissy fit and refused to advance legislation just because they wanted to discredit the president.  If they spent that time actually doing work, we might have a modern system of healthcare funding.  Instead we are left with more uncertainty than ever and more proposals that sound more-or-more *identical* to Obamacare!  Where's the master plan!?  You only had six years to scheme.

medicine,Have you thought about pursuing a non-clinical career or switching out of medicine completely?,"I'm an MD that switched early on in the game from clinical medicine to pursuing a non-clinical career in health insurance and more recently in entrepreneurship.

As a little bit of background, I was pretty certain by my third year of medical school that clinical medicine was not for me, but had little knowledge/opportunities/support to be able to explore fields outside of medicine. 

I loved the preclinical years - physiology, anatomy, pathology (perhaps not biochem so much..:) ) - and was extremely excited to be on the medicine journey. 

Then the clinical years hit - and almost immediately I did not resonate with the clinical application of the textbook information. I enjoyed being with patients, but did not get excited by clinical signs, was bored in surgery and thought the quality of life for the residents and consultants/attendees was poor (skipping meals/bathroom breaks, working 12+ days regularly, black bags under their eyes...). Managing stroke patients, palpating enlarged livers, assisting with appendectomies or working my way through overbooked outpatient clinics was not my idea of something I could realistically do for the next 40 years without dying of boredom. 

So lo and behold, I graduated med schoool with honours, but the unhappiness, tiredness and frustration mounted quickly. Eight-minute consultations with patients just to adjust their prescriptions had me feeling less-than-fulfilled to say the least (glorified pharmacist comes to mind), and it was frowned upon to spend any longer with patients in clinic or on ward rounds - the team, whether medicine or surgery, just had too many demands to get through each day.

I'm not even going to start with the on-call part - 30-hour shifts, beeper going off non-stop etc. etc. On my first call, I got four hours of accumulated sleep, and was told the next day that that was an 'excellent' call and I should consider myself lucky... again, the quality of life, health implications and just expecting better for my future certainly came to the forefront. Was I doomed to spend the rest of my life like an overworked, non-passionate, zombie-like doctor who thinks four hours of sleep is excellent? I shuddered at the thought.

When looking outside of medicine, any of the 'support' and 'information' available was if you couldn't 'hack' it in medical school or residency (roll eyes), then you could pursue a master in international health, public health, medical management etc. Again, after doing a bit of research, these degrees didn't offer a passionate career that I was hoping medicine would have satisfied.

What surprised me the most was not the paucity of information available on the world wide web for physicians looking to pursue a non-clinical career or quit medicine (there is a bit more information now how many years later), but instead what shocked me was the resistance from other physicians. I couldn't believe the amount of other MD's who made the following statements:

-""You're crazy for leaving medicine, look at all you have invested (time, $$ etc.)!"" - My response: Just because you're digging a hole and realize it's in the wrong place does not mean that you need to keep digging! Stop, climb out, and start again. We are not a tree, we can move.

-""You're going to waste over half a decade of training and knowledge, right down the tube!"" My response: Just because I am trained as a physician does not mean that my accumulated experience, skills and knowledge will be wasted. These can be applied to a multitude of clinical and non-clinical settings. Think of quality control and management (all those medical notes you write!), time management (getting through a 50-patient day clinic, hypokalemic patient on the ward and consults throughout a regular working day), prioritization, ability to handle (literal) life-and-death situtations with time constraint, incredible skill of absorbing volumes of dense, complex information in a short period of time for practical application... these are all skills that we have as physicians that *very* few people outside of the clinical arena in the corporate or start-up world have. Talk about an A-grade applicant!

-""You'll never make it. Medicine is the only thing we know."" My response: Dude, we've overcome insurmountable odds to make it through pre-med and medical school. We've pulled all-nighters, taken (and passed!) some of the most difficult exams in the world and dealt in life-or-death situtations in the workplace each and everyday. Relax, switching career is not like climbing Mt. Everest during an avalanche - it's just switching career.

I resigned from my clinical position, and my consultant/attending at the time, an incredible rheumatologist and all around gentleman, understood and encouraged me taking time off to ""travel and do what I need to do"". Then he closed off saying: ""You're a great clinician, so I would be happy to be your reference when you return to medicine."" I was more than grateful for the understanding and support. As I walked out of the hospital for the last day, it then struck me - he actually expected this to be a 'short break' and then I'll be back in the clinical field. It never occured to him that I would be walking away from clinical medicine permanently!

To make a long story short, I successfully nagivated a place in public health insurance for a few years and quite enjoyed it - developing policies and procedures that impacted thousands of patients at a time was exciting. However, alas and alack, bureaucracy (and politics) is the antithesis of progress and implementation and eventually became very weary.

Now I've recently started my own business, and really enjoying the journey - the ups, downs and wins, big and small, that growing a business from the ground up provides. Again, totally different from clinical medicine and health insurance, but exciting all the same.

What about you?

Have you ever thought that clinical medicine isn't what it has cracked up to be?

Have you wondered if you were meant for a different path in life?

Have you ever wanted to find your true purpose and passion, but you're married to medicine?

medicine,"What did a medical student do to you that made you write outstanding evals for them? And, on the flip-side, horrendous evals?","Share your stories.

EDIT: I’ve decided to compile a guide based off professional responses on this thread. I think this guide will be very useful to future/current medical students like myself. I’ll continue editing as more responses come in. ~ /u/TheDivineOne 

**A Guide to Achieving Excellent Evaluations During Medical School and Beyond:**

* **Show up on time**

    **The most popular answer on this thread** and it needs no explanation. It is important that an MS shows respect for his/her peers, patients, and medical institution. Don’t waste people’s times. If you have some sort of medical/personal emergency just let your mentors know that you can’t show up and they’re most likely to understand. Be sure to reschedule your assignment if you don’t show up. Otherwise, don’t be late.


* **Be useful/proactive:**

    Read up on your shit, read articles and research, definitely read your patients’ charts if you have access, don’t just look on UpToDate, be somewhat familiar with your surroundings and environment. 

    Offer to help when appropriate (**this is a big one**). (Ex: “hello Dr. X, would you like me to help you with tasks X, Y, and Z? Let me know what expectations you have and how I can help you to the best of my ability.”)

    Ask questions when appropriate. Your residents and attendings signed up for a teaching-ternship so they know they are supposed to be here for you and willing to help you.

    Understand that some rotations rarely have lunch breaks, so prepare accordingly and bring a snack or two. If you have extra snacks, share em with the nurses and students! Giving food = receiving better evals.

* **Don’t be afraid to ask questions. *BE Curious***

    You are first and foremost a student, not a real doctor and not expected to know everything just yet. Ask for help. (Ex: “Morning Dr. X, I was really intrigued by the patient we saw yesterday who had [disease]. I went home and did some reading on the diagnosis and treatment for my presentation in my clinical studies class. I was wondering if you could review my project or if I could ask for your professional opinion on it?”)

    What doctors do is emotionally taxing, confusing, scary, and there is no reason for you to feel that you must be 100% competent 100% of the time. If you’re unsure about a patients status? Ask a nurse or intern. Don’t know what to do during a rotation? Ask a senior student, resident, attending, at the appropriate time. 

    Explore with your patients and mentors what drives you, what you like/dislike, and the kind of medicine they practice.

    Even if you dislike the rotation/specialty, at least be interested in learning. Know the patients in the rotation, their problems, their labs, have an idea of a plan, and see how it might relate to your field. (Ex: you might hate neurology but you have to understand and appreciate how neurology plays a part in surgery/obgyn/path, since you’ll sometimes get patients with neurological problems and it’s important to learn some of the basic neurological skills during your rotation).

    Are you suicidal/depressed? Get help as soon as possible. No occupation, even medicine, is ever worth losing your life.

* **Be clean; wear something professional.**

    Don’t wear anything you would be ashamed to wear around your grandparents. Don’t come into the hospital drunk, smelling like weed, high, wearing a miniskirt or a see through shirt, or like you just went to a party.

* **Manners**

    “Please”, “excuse me”, “sir or ma’am”, and “thank you’s” go a long way. Offer to get patients water or blanket when appropriate. Don’t talk about religion or politics. Smile, nod, and act professionally in front of your attending and residents. 

    Be kind to everyone, from your fellow peers, mentors, administrators, and even the medical instruments.

    Keep your sarcasm to yourself. If a mentor makes a friendly joke, be cool, and act as colleagues rather than buddies.

    Don’t say “ewww that’s so gross” or “holy crap this patient’s dick is super tiny”
    Don’t bitch or complain, you’re here to learn.

* **Don’t look down on nurses, patients, or other students**


    Don’t speak about your patients’ experiences and motivations like you  know them because chances are you’re still very inexperienced and it will come off as cocky (ex: don’t tell your depressed patient that he/she needs to get some sunshine “in your experience”).

    *Be kind to nurses. They will make your medical school experience very hard or easy* depending on how you treat them. They are part of our healthcare team and probably know more than you do.

    Don’t talk shit about other students, patients, or workers.

    Being an “ivy-leaguer” does not give you permission to be a dick.


* **Have situational and self-awareness**


    It’s okay to ask questions, but sometimes it’s not the right time (ex: when someone is coding).

    Know when to STFU; be conscientious.

    Walk to the side of the hallways not in the middle; make space for codes and emergencies.

    Understand that as a MS you are part of the team, but not part of the gang. You leave in a month and these residents have been here for a year or more, so understand that you still need to walk the line of professionalism and personableness. 


* **Don’t lie**


    If you didn’t do it then you didn’t do it.

    Saying “I don’t know but I can try to find out for you” is an acceptable answer.

    If you hate this specialty and/or have no interest in matching this field don’t lie and say “omg im having a medical relevation and want to match this specialty” just so you can get higher evals—it won’t work and people can see through it.


**Rotation-specific advice:**

***In general:*** know the patients, labs, images, history, vitals, nursing notes, consults, etc.. Write it down and have it available if someone asks.

**Pediatrics:** be as nice as you can to the kids and parents. Offer them some toys, chairs, blankets, a sticker. 

**Ob/gyn:** be around, aware, and prepared— babies pop out randomly in general. Try not to miss out on all the deliveries sleeping on their call

**Internal Med:** show up, be interested, learn your patients’ H&amp;P if you have access. Get out of people’s ways

**Surgery:** like all the advice, be eager, curious, and grateful to retract. Retract is what many interns have to do so it’s good that you learn. Figure out what matierals you need to do the dressing change and gather it ahead of time.

**Anesthesiology:** similar to surgery advice but also show up during anesthesia time. If the patient is already asleep by the time you come in, then you've probably missed a lot of the good stuff. Don't be afraid to ask nurses for help.

**Psychiatry:** be respectful and watch what you say. Your words can trigger patients or disrespect the service. Psychiatry is a sensitive area with a lot of vulnerable people.

**Family:** basically a summary of all the rotation-specific advice

**Emergency Medicine:** arrive early (15 min is on time). Be eager, volunteer, don’t expect to actually do anything. Only leave when the resident leaves unless otherwise told.
 
**Neurology:** same as above.


**Pro-tips:**

Evaluations are no doubt subjective. Sometimes your resident or mentor will have a terrible day and you just happen to be the unfortunate student who has to take the lash. The best thing you can do is just follow these guidelines and be prepared. It is surprisingly shocking to fail in medical school once you pass your exams and boards, so don’t be too nervous— it is alright to make mistakes. Do your best, be curious, ask questions, have manners, etc. As a student, you are still learning the ins and outs of medicine, so you are not expected to be perfect. However, since you did get into medical school after all, you have to have a bit of competency, preparedness, and professionalism (ex: don’t smell like weed in the hospital). To conclude, do your best, be normal, caring, communicate, learn, and have fun in your rotations. After all, medicine is being more integrative and inter-connected, so it helps tremendously to understand and appreciate what each specialty does.",205,228,2016-11-26,PHARMA,0.07188228890299797,0.899709165096283,0.028408574871718884

Unfortunately, we were unable to locate the CE or whatever source they may have pulled that info from.

I was just seeing if anyone had any insight into this or had heard the same.

From the research I did, I haven't found anything that says it would be unstable. Flavorx has a recipe for it and states that all of their product/compounds have been tested via chromatography and all maintain their potency.

It came up positive for opiates, but he claims he took like 8 tabs of imodium (and a tab of clonazepam). 

I'm a PA in family med but this question was a bit beyond my knowledge. Looking at Uptodate and cross-reactivity guides, I'm seeing that imodium should not cross-react. I was hoping one of you fine folks might be able to comment on this? In the meantime, I have told her this is likely a genuine positive, but to avoid the witch-hunt until confirmed by send-out.

I wanted to become a pharmacist ever since high school, but multiple medical issues kind of halted my education and my life in general. I wanted to become a pharmacist (compound pharmacist to be exact) because I find all medications and their chemical structures and interactions/mechanisms of action very interesting.

medicine,Are there any American physicians here who practice abroad?,"Hello, I'm seriously thinking about leaving the U.S. and moving to either Ireland or England and am looking for advice from other physicians who have done the same. I'm an attending physician who completed medical school and pediatric residency in the U.S. and have been in practice for 6 years. Are there any U.S.-trained physicians on this reddit who can advise me on their process of leaving the U.S.?

I've done a lot of research but still have a lot of questions. It looks like I would qualify for a medical license in both countries, but I'm not sure where to begin. Do I look for a job and then begin the licensing process (here in the U.S., we give preference to applicants who have already applied for or have an active state license)? How do I go about finding a job (I've looked at some international locums websites but there's nothing in peds)? Would I have trouble obtaining a work visa in one of these countries with no personal or family connections there?

FYI, I'm working as a pediatric hospitalist and would love to continue working in that field. Does anyone know if this field exists outside of the U.S.? I spoken to a couple of doctors who are somewhat familiar with the UK health system, and I get the impression that most pediatricians work in clinic settings and that the subspecialists run the hospital wards. I've looked at the websites for children's hospitals in Dublin and London and there are some ""general pediatricians"" listed, but it doesn't specifically say if they are hospital or clinic based. Does anyone know what my options are in Ireland or England with pediatric residency training and no fellowship?
