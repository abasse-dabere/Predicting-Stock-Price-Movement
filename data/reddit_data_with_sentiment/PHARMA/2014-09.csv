medicine,Legal (board stuff) advice,"When I was younger (18 years old) I was charged with a felony for attempted promotion of a harmful drug. I hired the best lawyer I could get, and since the evidence against me was weak (I really hadn't done anything wrong) I was offered a deferred sentence with 5 years of probation. During that time, I did not even get pulled over once.
I live in the state of Hawaii and I am wanting to apply for medical school. I was always under the impression that because I completed the terms, the state dropped the charges, and I got my record expunged it was done and over with like it never happened.
I am very passionate about medicine and do really well in college, however I am now afraid that applying to medical school will be futile as I may never be able to get my DEA license?
Does anyone have any experience in this matter? I have a friend who swears his friend has a cocaine felony still on his record, but I find that hard to believe.

3) Do you ever work ""on the field"" or is that something that is only reserved for 3rd world countries?

4) I have heard that rural docs are always on call and that ""you are the doc"" . .. meaning that you get to do many things. On the other hand, they say that rural medicine is a bit slower than city. Which one is true? Why?

I was like, ""I don't think so,"" because I didn't think ProAir contained alcohol at all...the pharmacist and technician basically said ""That's what we thought, too"" but asked if I could look it up and check package inserts to be sure. 

Sure enough, I found out that ProAir does, in addition to its HFA propellant, contain ethanol. Is it enough to make someone fail an ignition interlock device breathalyzer, I have no idea.

A little while later, out of curiosity, I opened up the package insert for Ventolin, and found out that it was, in fact, alcohol-free. Its only excipient is the propellant. So, an interesting difference between ProAir and Ventolin is that Ventolin is alcohol-free but ProAir is not.

pharmacy,The issue of retail pharmacies getting away with medical errors for speed and metrics.,"I've been working at a pharmacy long enough to realize that upper management encourages employees to work at dangerously high speeds that will (and does) result in medical errors.

Fortunately, many of these medical errors don't always cause harm to the patient in question and from what I can gather on the net, the individual must have been harmed for any legal action to be taken against the pharmacy.

Upon talking to several retail pharmacists, they said that the pharmacists never get in trouble because it has to be intentional and if they did know about it after the fact, they just have to report it and they will be in the clear.

So my issue is, senior management is pushing employees to work at ridiculous speeds *knowing* that they can get away with any mistakes because it was unintentional ...

Am I the only one who noticed this or have others been bothered by this too? A friend of mines said they have 9 seconds to approve or decline a script for accuracy at her company. That's not enough time to check patient profile for interactions, allergies, verify dangerous dosage with doctors, etc. It's madness.",29,23,2014-09-07,PHARMA,0.17463889718055725,0.8035156726837158,0.021845422685146332

medicine,Last Day!! Essentials of Point-of-Care Ultrasound free on iBooks,"Hi All,

We are very excited to announce that our e-book titled “Essentials of Point-of-Care Ultrasound” will be free on the iBooks Store during the first 2 weeks of September.

Since 2001, The Emergency Department Echo Course and The EDE 2 Course have taught EDE (pronounced “Eddie”) to over 10,000 physicians worldwide, including over half of the Canadian emergency medicine workforce. The most distinctive aspect of the EDE courses has been the focus on image generation. When clinicians first began investigating the possibility of using ultrasound themselves, a big secret was concealed from them: image interpretation is easy. The real challenge is image generation: putting the image on the screen. Before the EDE courses, physicians learned image generation mostly by trial and error. EDE brought a rigorous methodology to the scanning of each area of the body, dramatically reducing the time needed to master this new skill.

“Essentials of Point-of-Care Ultrasound” combines the EDE course manuals which have been written and rewritten for over a decade to give health-care providers the clearest and most concise approach to bedside ultrasound. This “how-to” guide contains over 700 illustrations, photos, and ultrasound images, 40+ videos, slideshows, quizzes, reference hyperlinks to Pub Med, links to EDE blog content, an interactive glossary, chapter summaries, study cards and reader-defined notes.

Click here for more information about the e-book on The EDE blog. Click here for more information about the e-book on iTunes.

Please consider forwarding this to your fellow students, residents, other trainees, and faculty. We believe they will find our e-book useful. We will announce free updates (new chapters, added functionalities, etc.) on Twitter (@EDE_blog) and on our blog at http://edeblog.com/.

With kind regards,

Steve Socransky, MD, FRCPC, DABEM

medicine,"Teach a Medical student, ""Explain your condition/disease/ailment to me""","I am a medical student in my second year currently studying pathology of the body. 
In my experience I can increase my learning of a concept by making a social connection to it. (Example: I had a friend who had Guillain–Barré syndrome and I can always remember it because I connect it with him. I also believe that I am more conscious of the way the syndrome affects patient's lives because I saw how it affected him. 

It would be great if you could explain your condition to the best of your understanding and write a little bit about how it affects your life day to day. If you have any pictures of it that would be great too.

I think this could be really helpful in making me and other med students see not just the disease but the patient and person. 

I got this idea when I saw this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2ghkwa/xrays_of_my_metal_arm/

As I'm filling out these patients charts, I'm able to see that they have been to the ER 5,10, maybe even 20 times within the past few years. I understand that they are coming to the ER because they probably don't have a primary care doctor, but how on earth are they able to afford these visits?

If a patient does NOT have health insurance, but gets treatment in the ER, who picks up the bill? The patients are obviously not paying for it, as they certainly would be bankrupt by their 2nd ER visit. Even if they were on medicaid, I'd think there would be more strict requirements for ER visits. Can someone please explain?

medicine,An epiphany about medicine.,"I'll preface this with the fact that I'm a 4th year medical student in the UK.

Today, I had an epiphany about myself and medicine that I feel has been a long time coming. I thought others might appreciate what dawned on me.


I don't want to be a doctor, in the conventional sense. By that I mean, I do not want to work as a clinician in a hospital or as a general practitioner/family doctor. For the most part, I have not really enjoyed the placements I have had over the past 2 years. I find myself incredibly bored in clinics, wards and surgery, and am becoming increasingly frustrated at how much you have to sacrifice to be a conventional doctor. On further thought, I've yet to meet a doctor who I found to be an inspiration to me, or who I consider a role model.

 I have always struggled when I have been asked what I want to specialise in, though I now realise that's because no specialty really pulls me toward it. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 years of study because they were university based with occasional placements, rather than solely placement based. Now that I have realised this, I feel like there's a lingering dread that's been lifted. I hope now to finish medical school and then find an alternative career that involves more of the academic side of medicine.

If anyone else has had a similar experience, I'd love to hear what your thoughts are, and how you came to realise that being a clinician wasn't for you.",66,61,2014-09-16,PHARMA,0.04303009808063507,0.908320426940918,0.048649441450834274

medicine,"Need perspective on death, thanks.","I'm having a particularly hard time dealing with the pregnancy and labor of a friend. She's been under the care of a midwife throughout the pregnancy, has lost two pregnancies prior, and had moderate oligohydraminos and had a transverse positioning though this pregnancy. She's been very resistant to c sections and inductions and has sought care from a chiropractor for manipulations and turning. At 42 weeks she still hadn't had any sign of contractions so the midwife attempted to induce. At some point the heart rate of the baby dropped significantly and by the time she got to the hospital the doctor couldn't section her fast enough and the heart stopped entirely before she was opened. 

I'm so angry and I feel guilty for not talking her out of this. Now people are talking about God calling back another angel and it infuriates me. I never said anything initially because I didn't want her to react poorly to me and take it out on the doctors involved. I assumed the midwife would at least know when to call it quits and take her in but I also thought that would have happened before 42 weeks. 

I'm a third year med student and I obviously don't have all the answers but this seems unreasonable. Things happen and people make mistakes and you can't make decisions for people but all of this seems so preventable. I need perspective on this and how to deal with it professionally too. The doctor is going to have to account for this at some point and I can't help but wonder how much they're going to be responsible for.

We are trying to determine the best way to protect ourselves while handling &amp; transporting patients in a small aircraft as well as try to determine beforehand the likelihood of a patient being infected with Ebola (as opposed to yellow fever or malaria). 

We've discussed:

* How to protect against transmission during the evac

* Proper handling attire: a gown tucked in to gloves, mask, wrap around glasses

* Always using an oxygen mask on the patient to protect against oral transmission

* Whether Ebola is a virus with an envelope that can be killed with alcohol or the amount of time the virus can survive in the airplane before cleaning (we've been told 24 hours)

We are frustrated by the info provided by the CDC compared to that which doctors from Europe have given us that seem to conflict.

OPEN LETTER TO OPPOSE ANYTHING NATUROPATHIC: 

I am writing to convey my deep interest that [representative title here] [surname] does not support H.R. 508 for ""Naturopathic Medicine Week"".
[Change intro sentence to reflect current bill in any legislature]

Naturopathic medicine is only licensed in 17 states, across which there are wide disparities in scope of practice and regulatory oversight. Naturopaths who graduate from one of the 4-year accredited universities are taught pseudoscience, and only a small portion of modern medical science. They use words like ""accredited"" and ""4-year doctoral program"" to describe their training, but these do not bear truth on the quality nor content of their education. Accreditation by the US Department of Education is through a proxy organization which is private and run by naturopaths. Thus accreditation does not mean that naturopathic medicine has a seal of government approval. Rather, accreditation means that the naturopathic colleges meet administrative, student judiciary, and accounting criteria. The content or validity of naturopathic education is not evaluated at this level. Naturopaths describe their accreditation as ""government approved, and this misrepresentation belies naturopathic medicine.

There are very lax entrance requirements for a student of naturopathic medicine: they are not required to take the MCAT and typically have lower GPAs than pre-medical students. This effect can be seen by looking at the percentage of student's accepted by naturopathic medical schools. Many are over 60%, which is a number that would make any real pre-medical student cringe given they are selected for very carefully by medical schools at high levels of scrutiny. I want to highlight that naturopaths are opposed by every major medical organization, and naturopaths largely oppose vaccination and practice psuedoscientifc treatment modalities that are shown to be ineffective or utterly implausible. Yet naturopaths consider these ""real"" medicine, i.e., homeopathy, hydrotherapy, iridology, and touchless energy medicine. Despite this, many naturopaths have very liberal drug prescriptive authority but not the coursework or clinical hours training needed to safely and effectively manage pharmaceutical drugs for simple or complex disease presentations.

Please understand that naturopaths should be examined under a very careful lens. Naturopaths try to claim that they have the
equivalent education as medical doctors, but this is not true. They are taught highly implausible treatment modalities like homeopathy and
hydrotherapy as their core philosophy. They are taught that ""natural"" is better and less dangerous.  They do not need to finish a medical residency before earning the right to practice ""medicine,"" and those that do naturopathic residencies are rare and take place in outpatient clinics where they have insufficient contact with the range and complexity of diseases needed to make them effective primary care physicians. Furthermore, their licensing exam is not made public for external review, and thus it is not known on what medical topics and at what level of rigor they are examined.

For comparison of training between MDs/DOs and naturopaths please refer to the American Academy of Family Physicians chart: http://www.aafp.org/dam/AAFP/documents/advocacy/workforce/gme/ES-FPvsNaturopaths-110810.pdf

Naturopaths circulate their own ""comparison"" which widely manipulates their courses and clinical hours. Basically, it includes their pseudoscientific training as medical school course hours, when in fact, such topics are irrelevant to the practice of medicine. Medical doctors need a multi-year residency in order to become primary care physicians and advance with additional specializations.

Please help the public good and the advancement of medical science by opposing Naturopathic Medicine week and rolling back licensing for
naturopaths.

I understand that most naturopaths are good people, but they have been misled by their professional organizations into thinking they can function as capable primary care physicians. Advancement of naturopathic medicine is a threat to public health, and therefore the practice of naturopathic medicine should not be considered safe, effective, or affordable health care.

medicine,"UK doctor thinking about moving to USA: I have many questions, and would appreciate advice, especially from those who have done this.","Dear Doctors of Reddit.

I am looking for some advice as well as information about how the US healthcare system functions.  I have looked around reddit, but can’t find a straightforward answer to my questions.

I am a UK doctor in my second year of practice post graduation (in my second foundation year).  I also hold US citizenship, and although I left the US as a child, lately I have been thinking about coming back to the US to practice.  My partner of 8 yrs is a doctor at the same level as me, and a UK citizen.

My primary motivating factors are firstly, in either the East or North West coast where I would like to end up, the weather is much better than in Scotland where I am currently based.  There is also more scope for skiing and biking, which are my two main hobbies.  My second motivating factor is salary.  As far as I understand a starting resident’s salary is around $40k-50k, and tax is ?15-20% (not really sure about that).  Compare that to my starting salary last year of around £22-25K with tax of around 30%.

As I left the USA as a child, I have no idea how the health care system works.  For example in the UK, if someone becomes ill, they either go to the ED, or they go to the GP, who either sorts them out, or refers them to specialists at the local hospital.  I am working in a hospital at the moment, and we have the option of transferring patients to other hospitals, psychiatric hospitals etc based on their need and what can be provided on site.  Is this at all similar to the states? IE if someone presents to their GP who realises that they need to be referred to specialist care, does this happen, or does someone just present to, for example, a cardiologist, because they think they need one.

Then, how does the US system work for doctors? I think I want to be a medic, but still making up my mind as to speciality.  As far as I understand, after medical school, you become resident for X amount of years in your chosen residency.  What happens after that?  Is being a doctor akin to being a business person, in so far that you have to set up your own practice, find your own patients etc?  If I became a GP, who would my patients be, and what kind of salary could I expect?

Another big question I have is, are there UK trained doctors on reddit who have made this transition? If so, how did you do it?  How long does it take to do the whole process from starting to study for the USMLE, to starting your residency?  As I live in the UK, I can see a lot of time and money going into interviewing for residencies etc. (something which I don’t have too much of).  

As for me, I like working in UK hospitals and for the NHS.  I am familiar with it, and am comfortable with the options available to me.  I get &gt;28 days annual leave – is it around 15 days in the US for residents?

Anyhow, lots of questions, but I’m hoping I can get some answers here.  This is a really difficult decision that I am agonising over.

Ill be around for a while this evening to answer questions/ask more, as well as tomorrow evening.  Thanks!",71,63,2014-09-21,PHARMA,0.044833701103925705,0.9188134670257568,0.03635280579328537

  Yes, yes, I know, it's one of the best in the world or something. But it seems like we strive for mediocrity. We aim to hit the baseline, nothing more. The focus is **always** on saving more money. More work, less people. This includes everything, and maybe especially the nursing staff suffers because of it. I've been living a life where I'm constantly fighting to cope with the work amount, but where I'm being governed by people unwilling to admit that we are overworked, and unwilling to pay for the extra time my coworkers and myself all put in because of it.

  Is this really my life? Is this what I chose? Is the medical profession so ""altruistic"" that it means I can't marry my (also a doctor) boyfriend because neither of us will ever, ever, EVER have the time to have kids, pick them up from school, help with homework? 

Is the sacrifice really this fucking high?

  I apologise. I am disillusioned and angry. People are treated like shit, and I don't understand why. Please help me understand why. 

**EDIT** Thank you so much for your input, everyone. I'm so torn between protecting myself and my future career, or taking a stand right now.

medicine,The intersection of greed and medicine Why did Joan Rivers die? Let’s connect the dots..,"**The Intersection of Greed and Medicine**

Why did Joan Rivers die? Let’s connect the dots.

I loved Joan Rivers.  I never met her, but I loved listening to her on the Howard Stern show. She was an amazing guest. Listening to her over the years, I came to feel—as so many of her listeners did—that I actually did know her, that she had became almost a friend. I consider myself a humble but highly caring and ethical surgeon, and I cannot stop thinking about what killed Joan Rivers. I am convinced that she did not have to die. If things had been done in a proper and prudent fashion, she would still be alive and kicking.  

I had to try to figure out what went wrong in Joan’s care.

I think the answer is that the clinical decisions regarding her care were not made in her best interests.  Instead, her care was designed to make the most money for her doctors.  Gone are the days when I can say, “Trust me—I’m a doctor,” because too many of my fellow doctors can’t be trusted. Greed has warped their decision-making. Patients need to be better informed about how economic decisions affect their care.    

Dr. Karen Sibert has written an excellent analysis of the Joan Rivers case, “Anesthesiologist’s Review of the Facts in the Joan Rivers Case” (http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2014/09/15/an-anesthesiologists-review-of-the-facts-in-the-joan-rivers-case/). But what really happened is still a mystery. 

What follows includes some speculation, but it is my educated guess regarding what took place at Yorkville Endoscopy on 8/28/14 around 0930.  

Yorkville Endoscopy is in a miserable location on 2nd  Avenue in New York.  The construction of a new subway line is underway there. The subway construction and scaffolding erected at the entrance make it difficult to even get an emergency stretcher into the endoscopy suite!

Why did Joan have her procedure there?  Because Dr. Lawrence B. Cohen did not want to share his fees with Mount Sinai Hospital.  Joan’s procedure should have been done in the hospital, NOT in the ambulatory center.  She was old and fragile and precious.

Dr. Cohen is a super-smart doctor, but probably also an arrogant one.  By all accounts, he is a great gastroenterologist.  But he is also the main national proponent of having gastroenterologists capture the anesthesiology fees that would ordinarily—and properly—go to the anesthesiologist. These fees are a tempting target because the anesthesia provider will quite often be reimbursed at a higher rate than the gastroenterologist,.

Dr. David Dies has written a good analysis of Dr. Cohen’s effort to eliminate anesthesia personnel, “How Joan Rivers Might Save Your Life” (http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/opinion/guest-columnists/2014/09/18/joan-rivers-might-save-life/15793599/ ). Dr. Dies understands Dr. Cohen’s mindset. 

Even though an MD anesthesiologist was in the room with Dr. Cohen during Joan’s entire procedure, that anesthesiologist was most likely an employee of Dr. Cohen’s and totally subservient to him.  In such a relationship, the anesthesiologist could not have any independent judgment and had to do whatever Dr. Cohen commanded.  The administration of anesthesia was a process owned by or dominated by Dr. Cohen. Therefore the anesthesiologist couldn’t cancel or reschedule the case.  

There may have a three-way decision (or conspiracy) among Dr. Cohen, Joan, and Joan’s good friend Dr. Gwen Korovin to have her vocal cords “checked out” while she was under anesthesia so that Joan would not feel any pain during the procedure. Dr. Korovin took a now-notorious selfie while Joan was under anesthesia. Why was Dr. Korovin even allowed to participate in the procedure? Well, Joan had given verbal consent to let her check out her raspy voice and to perform any indicated procedures.  No truly independent MD or Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) would have permitted Gwen to take a selfie and then participate in the endoscopy. But there was no strong independent advocate for Joan at the head of the bed. 

From here on the rest of the story was inevitable.  Joan most likely had a vocal cord spasm that couldn’t be broken. The reason it couldn’t be broken might have been economic.

The only drug approved in the US to break a vocal cord spasm is an intravenous medication known as sux (*succinylcholine* or *suxamethonium chloride*).  Although sux itself it's not expensive, having sux available is expensive. If you buy sux, then you must also buy an antidote for a rare sux reaction termed *malignant hyperthermia* (MH).  An MH cart costs  about $2500 and is only good for 3 years.  My speculation is that Yorkville Endoscopy did not want to have sux in the building to save the MH cart costs.

But even without sux Joan could have been saved. 

If a simple tracheotomy or cricothyroidotomy had been performed quickly it could have saved her life—but neither procedure was performed, and Joan died. Why didn’t Dr. Korovin perform a tracheotomy or cricothyroidotomy? My speculation is that there may not have been enough equipment available in the ambulatory center to do either procedure and that Dr. Korovin became panic-stricken when Joan arrested. She probably wasn’t prepared for the crisis. In her panicked state she probably couldn’t think or function effectively. She may not have done a tracheotomy or cricothyroidotomy since her training days decades earlier. She was the ear, nose, and throat specialist to the stars, but she could not secure the airway of her brightest star patient.  

Joan probably consented to a very risky procedure. If so, her death was not really a case of “VIP syndrome” but rather an appalling lack of judgment on so many levels driven by greed and arrogance. Nobody had the courage or the incentive to stop the money train.  

Let’s make Joan’s death a teachable moment. There are several lessons to be learned from what happened to her.
Older and sicker patients should not be treated at an ambulatory endoscopy center. They should be taken care of in a hospital setting where there are abundant life-saving resources and there are always airway experts available within seconds.
 
Sux, an MH cart, and all possible life-saving equipment should be required and available whenever sedation is given for endoscopy or “minor procedures.”

The entrances and exits of any medical facility must accommodate an emergency stretcher.  

The standards of care for ambulatory anesthesia should be the same as that in the stringently regulated hospital environment.  When there are two highly qualified airway experts available to take care of you when you receive sedation (a board certified anesthesiologist and CRNA), then you are receiving true VIP care.

The anesthesiologist should be an independent and strong advocate for the patient and must be ever vigilant and stand up to a bullying or arrogant surgeon or gastroenterologist.  Joan was the victim of poor care and terrible judgment and she had nobody to protect her when she went to sleep for her last time.

What caused revolt among the medical community is that the doctor that came through this program did not have to take the test to validate their diplomas, like every professional who graduated abroad has to.
