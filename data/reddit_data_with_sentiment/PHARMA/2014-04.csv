medicine,What determines whether pulmonary edema or pleural effusion or both will develop in conditions like heart failure and pulmonary embolism?,"I believe that I understand the mechanism of both, but I don't understand why one or the other develops in conditions that increase pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and HF both increase pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure, resulting in increased filtration. If this filtration exceeds the capacity of reabsorption and lymphatic clearance, there will be accumulation of transudate outside of the capillary. If that capillary supplies alveoli then that fluid may end up in the alveoli as pulmonary edema, if the capillary supplies the pleura, then it can result in pleural effusion. But, why do patients with HF present with one and not the other? Is it due to the greater capacity of lymphatic clearance for the pleural space as compared to the alveoli? What about with PE? Does the location of the embolus in PE determine whether the patient will develop pulmonary edema or pleural effusion?

Starting salary for most FY1 hospital doctors is  £22,636.  http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/doctors/pay-for-doctors/

The first 4 years tuition fees and living costs for people studying medicine at undergraduate level are not supported by a bursary scheme as it is for nurses and other allied health professionals.  Medical students will run up debt through the student loans scheme from Student Finance England for maintenance and tuition fees in the first four years. http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/explore-by-career/doctors/training-to-become-a-doctor/undergraduate-medical-education/financial-support-for-students-on-degree-courses-in-medicine/

On average it takes about 10 years training to become a GP, and 14 years to become a surgeon. The average pre-tax pay for a NHS hospital doctor, 5 years post-degree, so usually in their early 30s,  is £40,000 ($65,000).  This equates to take-home pay of approximately £30,000 ($50,000).

medicine,ER nurse here- I found out today that a former patient committed suicide. How do I find peace/closure?,"The title is pretty self-explanatory.  I'm just wondering if anyone can offer some suggestions/support.

Our ER has been over-run lately with serious mental health visits.  We have also had two post-hanging patients brought into resus in less than a month. It has been a trying spring to say the least.

The kid I found out about today is one that I saw about a month &amp; a half ago,
who our ER doc absolutely refused to see for the duration of the night shift (he just kept putting his chart on the bottom of the pile &amp; actually told me ""I'm not seeing him"" while also telling his resident not to).  

I think it's important to mention that it was really not that busy of a night, &amp; this kid should not have had to wait that long.  However, this particular doc just doesn't like seeing mental health patients- so he let the kid wait all night long in emotional distress prior to passing his chart along to whichever doc took over in the morning.

I don't even know if a doctor ever saw him that day.  All I know is he was seen by one of our psychiatric emerg nurses &amp;
discharged with some community resources.

Of course the outcome very well could have been the same but I really can't help but wish we would have done more, or that I could have advocated better.

My heart breaks for this kid.  In emergency, why do so many health professionals see 'psych patients' as lost causes undeserving of care?   My colleagues were even judgmental towards me for spending so much time with him that night (while they sat around socializing since it was an unusually slow night). 

I just feel sick about it.  Can anyone relate?",77,64,2014-04-11,PHARMA,0.09847218543291092,0.8675142526626587,0.03401351720094681

pharmacy,I know it's futile to talk with some people about homeopathy...,"... but in this case I really feel like I should say something. Lately on my facebook, there have been a large group of mothers praising the use of ""Essential Oils"". (This is the brand they're making orders for: http://www.living-essential-oils.com/)

I know if they have the money, and they feel happy thinking that the oils are curing their UTI's and relieving their headaches, then I'll just roll my eyes and keep going. 

What I'm really concerned about are their children. They've been widely using it for treatment of asthma, to the point that two mothers were giving up the inhalers and putting their oil in humidifiers and rubbing it under their noses (the children's). Other uses like for colds and allergies aren't necessarily 'dangerous' for their kids, but it just bugs me that they're undergoing unnecessary discomfort because of their mothers' choices.

My problem is that I really don't know the exact ingredients in these oils. Googling wasn't very effective, and I'm assuming their anecdotal evidence is due to placebo-like effects.

medicine,"Just got accepted to PA school, seriously considering the MD route after what I saw last night.","Hi Meddit,
I am 22 year old female student, living at home and I need your advice.  I have always been on the fence about the MD and PA pathway, but after some considerations, I thought that the PA route for me. I love medicine, but I knew I wanted more time with my family. When I shadowed PAs in ER, ortho, and neuroncology, I saw that the PAs were less stressed, with less responsibilities. I thought that was really good, since I will be able to spend more time for hobbies. I also didn't want to be in school for so long, because I didn't want the financial burden. I have a low GPA (3.3) and thought I wouldnt be accepted to medical school, so PA school was an easier option.
But..last night, while volunteering in a level 1 trauma center, I saw a thoracostomy. I saw physicians and nurses rushing into the room to put on face masks and boot and shoe covers. I saw the amazing healthcare team operate to save the patient's life and I immediately felt a rush to do something. I want to be apart of this team. I want to feel this stress, but I then I remembered that i am an aspiring physician assistant. There were no physician assistants in trauma center. They were all in the slower parts of the ER. I don't mean to bash on physician assistants, but I think I want more responsibilities. Is this too late? Is this a dumb idea? Am I just glorifying ER physicians? I have never seen a physician assistant in the trauma area of an ER. 

Also, the PA school I was accepted into is one of the more expensive PA schools- putting me $120k in debt when I come out.",37,20,2014-04-14,PHARMA,0.049008678644895554,0.9139983057975769,0.036992959678173065

Everyone's heard or seen them in clinic or in the hospital. It can be as simple as the CHF patient who simply can't give up their ""fried X"" with extra salt, or the smoker who ""wants to do it without pills or patches"" to the patients who have nice flags next to their names in the EMR and may or may not require security.

medicine,Attending your patient's funeral,"A patient of mine died today. I generally keep a healthy, emotional distance between my patients and myself, however, for some reason I grew close with one patient in particular (perhaps it was that he was relatively young or that he was on our service for an abnormally long time). He and his family brightened up every time I walked into see him and despite the amount of stress I was under or how exhausted I was, I always left his room in better spirits. I felt comfortable enough with them that I gave them my cell phone number, which I never do. I started getting to the hospital 30 minutes earlier each morning just so I could have some extra time to converse with him and his family. I would fill them in on the plan of care, take any of their questions, and then it would often turn into him or one of his family members sharing a funny anecdote about his life. We all knew he was on borrowed time, but for those moments it was like his health was an afterthought, we were just people enjoying the company of one another. There were a few hard days when he was consumed with his mortality. He would tell me through teary eyes that he wished he had children or that he was simply just scared, and despite my attempts to hold them back, oftentimes, I cried with him, too. 


Things took a turn for the worst a week and a half ago, and we had to transfer him to the MICU. I continued to see him before rounds and before heading home, even after switching services. This morning before rounding on my patients, I was unable to find him in his room, so I asked one of the MICU nurses where he was, dreading the answer. He had apparently passed early this morning. Her statement hurt me, but it didn't really sink in. Later on today when I had some time off for lunch conference, I texted his wife to give my condolences and to tell her and her family how lucky I was to have met them. She responded almost immediately telling me that she, her family, and her late husband felt the same towards myself and that they would be honored if I attended his funeral. At that moment I started sobbing like I hadn't since I was a child. I accepted her offer, and told her I would be honored, as well.

But, my grades have been wonky during my undergrad due to depressive episodes. While these grades aren't fails, or even Ds, would mentioning my depression help account for these anomolous grades or is it a red flag for most committee members?

I've assumed it will hurt, but I would like to be completely honest and I'm wondering if it might explain myself instead of just ignoring these glaring grades. I have sought treatment and am now taking antidepressants which have completely changed my life. But these grades remain.

So, ignore them or talk about it?

  I saw an anaesthesiologist/pain physician giving out advice on how to handle chronic pain disorders with concurring psychiatric disorders. I got this weird sense that it would be awesome if this person did an AMA, perhaps joined by others of his specialization. 
  
  What does reddit think about this? Yay/nay?

  **There have been a few ideas floating around. Like weekly AMA's based on different specialities each week, or a long-running AMA thread. Personally I'm a fan of the weekly AMA idea. That way it won't blow over too fast, people can leave and get back to it, specialists can browse at their leisure for the best questions etc.**

medicine,Small Community Practice,"As someone interested in rural or other small community practice, I have to wonder, how does reputation or personal beliefs affect the success of a physician in either private or hospital practice?

For example, say the physician mentions they have liberal political beliefs in friendly conversation OUTSIDE a medical setting in a very conservative area (or switch around and say they're conservative in a liberal leaning area).  Does the quality of care given override word getting around or does the physician have to be held to a professional/personal standard of neutrality beyond that of someone who practices in a larger community?

I only use politics as an example, but other situations obviously apply.  I should also point out I'm not curious about extreme cases, as I can pretty much guess the consequences of a doctor, say, telling everyone to never get vaccinated or having prejudicial beliefs or that they're going to assassinate the president some day.",3,16,2014-04-27,PHARMA,0.036389678716659546,0.9174715280532837,0.04613879695534706

I assume these are defined around how providers receive their patients (referrals like HMOs, open access like PPOs, etc.), but what is it like to work in one versus another as a provider? Aspects like workload, schedules, non-clinical obligations such as paperwork, and (of course) pay.

pharmacy,Was pharmacist out of line ? controlled substance involved,"Just had a quick quick question regarding what occurred last week.

Here is what happened.  I have a prescription for ambien as part of my treatment for depression. I didn't have the bottle with me when I called so I didn't know when it was filed initially. I had a general idea, but I didn't know the exact dateI am going on a business trip for over a week. I just called and asked when is the soonest it could be refilled as I was going to be out of town. I couldn't get it refilled until May 6th. I didn't even think about having it transferred to a pharmacy where I am going up be staying until the pharmacist suggested it. I was fine with that situation. 

My wife has a bad back (going to need a fusion ) and had hernia surgery last Wednesday . She doesn't take it very often, but her doctor called in her own prescription for a few of them. The pharmacist then called my wife's doctor to tell him that I tried to get my prescription refilled early (out of context from our conversation $ and he felt uncomfortable dispensing it due to the fact we have same address. Doctor then rescinded the prescription and gave her something different that has not worked as well. She has not been sleeping well since then .

I went back to talk to the pharmacist in person. He said he was required to call the doctor as per Pennsylvania regulations. I explained what happened. It was nothing nefarious. I was going on a trip that would last through refill date, and my wife needed ambien temporarily due to her own medical issues. I was even more upset that my wife is suffering due to a phone call I made with a legitimate refill question ie going out of town. He made it seem to the doctor that she was trying to get a refill for me when that was not the case. He also divulged my medical information to a party without my per permission. Just really upset about how this all went down .",79,11,2014-04-29,PHARMA,0.2646400034427643,0.7128251194953918,0.022534845396876335
