medicine,Grief for a lung cancer patient: 1 month later he's seeing a naturopath,"I recently submitted my thoughts and deeply appreciated all of your replies regarding a patient in whom I found metastatic lung cancer. ( link https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/42vaza/currently_grieving_for_a_patient/ ) It has been a difficult, denial filled month for him. Since he and I talked, I have ordered more advanced imaging and consulted more sub-specialists than I had in the previous six months. He has had a 

&gt; CT of his chest (7cm spiculated mass)

&gt; CT guided biopsy (likely adenocarcinoma)

&gt; bronchoscopy (metastatic contralateral and ipsilateral lymph nodes)

&gt; brain MRI (2mm and 7mm suspicious lesions)

&gt; PET scan (confirms likely brain metastases)

&gt; multiple oncology and thoracic surgery consults

He is Stage IV, his chances for cure are zero as I understand them. The struggle is getting him and his family to understand this. I had a difficult conversation with him about a week ago in which we discussed what his staging truly meant. He and his family are in denial about his prognosis. They want second opinions, they are angry, they want a miracle cure.

I know I am taking this too personally because five years ago, I watched my child's godfather die from this same disease. It was found at Stage IIIa, he was treated up until the point when they found mets in his brain. Then he, his family and his oncologist decided together it was time to hang it up, get him comfortable at home, and take a more palliative approach. He died at home, surrounded by his wife of 50 years, his children, grandchildren, and godchildren. I want this for my patient, if it is possible, but I worry that it will not happen now.

Unfortunately when he and I talked about the option of ""doing nothing"" (his words, not mine), he took that to mean I thought there was a chance for a spontaneous remission. He thought getting no treatment meant that it could cure itself, whereas I meant to offer the option of no treatment beyond palliative care as a way to increase the quality of his remaining days while sacrificing some of the quantity. Instead of seeing palliative care or getting a second opinion, he has decided to see a naturopath. I don't know what it is they promised him, whether it was a better diet, less free radicals, chelating his cancer away...I dunno. But I worry that he has sacrificed both the quality AND the quantity of his days by ignoring both his oncologist and me. 

I am frustrated. I am frustrated by his oncologist who seemed to dismiss the thought of early palliative care consult in favor of aggressive experimental treatment. I am frustrated with myself because I could have worded my advice about quality of days vs quantity of days better. I am frustrated with the patient for being in denial. And I am frustrated that there is a naturopath vulture out there who is willing to lie to him and tell him there is a cure through tinctures and balms. 

I welcome your thoughts, as always.",100,151,2016-03-01,PHARMA,0.09984320402145386,0.8698241114616394,0.03033273294568062

1. Putting in a nasogastric tube in an obese woman with pancreatitis and she vomited bile all over me. Had to go home and change.

2. Did a PV exam on a patient as a medical student who had an STD. Took off the glove. Wrote some notes then realized I forgot to check something and did it again. New glove. Er... Actually old glove inverted by mistake. Washed my hand 5000 times.

3. Attacked by a Psych patient in a locked up ward. Put her naked breasts in my face and told me what to do with them. Rescued by fellow coworkers who mocked me.

Last one was due to me... My general surgery friend was about to start a hemorrhoidectomy and the patient coughed against the ventilator at that moment. When she stood up and raised her face I can't tell you how horrific it looked. I thought she'd been thrown head first into a chocolate cake. Change of clothes and shower, some tears, lots of silence after that, and a few weeks of being treated like a criminal.

Also had my aged Professor of anesthesiology working a cerebral aneurysm clipping with me. Nurse came to exchange the suction bottle. Prof went for tea. Nurse dropped bottle. Prof slipped on 2L of blood/wash and went sliding and fell on her back into the mulch. Hurt her leg, covered in blood....

medicine,Have resident work hour restrictions impacted the competence of surgeons coming out of training?,"So recently I was having a conversation with a senior surgeon at one of our larger community hospitals (US).

He felt they were inadequately trained and could not function independently, especially when alone at night/weekends on call. Now I know this is anecdotal, but have others had this experience?  It seems like the effects of duty hour restrictions could affect every specialty but would be most pronounced  in procedural fields like surgery where outcomes are directly proportional to the number of procedures performed. I thought this would be interesting to talk about in light of the recent [NEJM article](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1515724) that concluded there were no adverse patient outcomes associated with flexible, less restrictive work hours for surgical residents.",105,78,2016-03-04,PHARMA,0.3545573651790619,0.6174218654632568,0.028020834550261497

Yesterday I spent 27 minutes on the phone with a ""customer service"" rep from a pharmacy benefit plan (no medical training) trying to get one of my patients a medicine he needs.  Now I understand benefit plans trying to get me to use a generic or even a preferred brand to try to save money. I will always at least try that to keep costs down.  But when there is ONLY ONE FDA approved drug for a condition how in the world do you justify denying that medication when there is NO alternative and the drug isn't one that cost thousands of dollars ad year.   He'll get it eventually but not before me and my staff spend at least an hour on the phone appealing the denial. They do this just hoping I'll give up.  Why not, they are paying a $15/hr rep to keep me on the phone hoping I quit because if I do it saves the about $900 a year.

medicine,Low cost laparoscopic simulator that runs off a mobile phone,"Hi everybody, as the title suggests, I'm currently working on a low cost laparoscopic simulator that runs off a mobile phone.

Please have a look at the demo video on YouTube here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW1TJO74COc

I wanted to build something that individual students could afford, rather than the typical Simbionix simulators that sell for tens of thousands of dollars and end up sitting locked away in a simulation suite gathering dust.

Do you think this is something people want or need? Is there another application that you think would be more useful for surgical education?

For context, I've spent the last year working on applications of virtual reality in healthcare, having created the first 360 degree video of a surgical operation in London - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ALZkPoTYQ

medicine,Disclosing depression to your Program Director?,"Alt account for privacy. I'm a lower level resident in a relatively easy going non-surgical specialty and I was curious what others thought about disclosing medical conditions (particularly depression) that may impact performance/attendance at work?  

Backstory: I've been depressed for ~20 years but before medical school I did a relatively good job managing it without medication (plenty of exercise, some counsiling) but since medical school (primarily clinical rotations) and particularly since residency started things have gotten significantly worse as there hasn't been time for the self care activities I was using to manage before. Now I find myself 45 pounds fatter and without enough energy to do anything beyond going to work so I don't get fired. This, unfortunately, is causing increasing stress in my marriage because my wife would like to do things together when we have time off and I'll I can manage to do is sit in the dark in the house staring at a screen of some sort. Despite the impact on my personal life I have been able to perform at work (generally considered one of the top residents in my year) but I know this will catch up to me soon as I've been riding an excellent knowledge base from medical school but not improving upon it (zero motivation/energy) by doing outside reading. 

I just recently  took the step of seeing a physician to begin pharmacotherapy which I'm hoping will help enough to allow me to start helping myself again but I'm likely going to need time for intermittent physician visits in the future. Should I tell my PD what is going on or should I leave it general (needing visits for a medical issue)? Any other advice I may benefit from for dealing with depression as a resident?

medicine,Pharmacy refusing to fill pain medication prescriptions for my patient,"Anyone deal with something like this before? 


I am a board certified interventional pain management physician. A cornerstone of my practice is appropriate opioid prescribing for people who need pain medication so I do my due diligence in evaluating people and running screening reports. Not a candy shop, right? So the other day I get a referral from a spine surgeon and the patient tells me a few days prior Walgreens refused to fill the hydrocodone prescription he received on the basis of, the spine surgeon who wrote the Rx was no longer taking care of him. I talked to the surgeon's staff, and they verified that Walgreens had called snooping about the patient's plan of care, wanting the ICD 10 code - but Walgreens didn't tell them they were going to cancel the prescription. This guy is basically your grandpa and hadn't had to take any pain medications for 8 months, his prescription record was normal and his pain was real.


Ok, fine. I write a new prescription for him and he takes it to the same Walgreens. He's going to be seeing me on a monthly basis now so surely they will accept it, right? No, they reject it again. This time they don't even bother to call my office to ask about it. He gets the prescription back and takes it to a different pharmacy to fill.


I called the Walgreens to find out what was happening, and the pharm tech told me that their pharmacy manager makes the decision of whether or not they dispense ""those kinds of medications."" She told me only the pharmacist could say why the prescription was denied but there isn't a written record of rejected prescriptions. I've had pharmacists call to double check on early refills and altered prescriptions before, but I've NEVER had anyone flat out refuse to fill a perfectly valid prescription. Without even contacting me! My address and office number are clearly written on the prescription! She tried to tell me that Walgreens had a new policy on opioid prescriptions where they're not filling them any more but I called the neighboring store and they said that wasn't true. The other pharmacy tech hypothesized that the store didn't want to start giving opioids to new patients. 


I am incredibly angry. The pharmacist humiliated my patient, twice. I don't think it is up to him to decide whether a pain medication is appropriate when there are no red flags (like a record of multiple different prescriptions at different pharmacies - this guy hadn't fill anything in months). Obviously he did not do a physical exam on my patient or review his MRI.

medicine,Pharmacy refusing to fill pain medication prescriptions for my patient - UPDATE #1,"[OP here](https://redd.it/49xm3y)

Thank you for the discussion, I know some of you were interested in an update. I verified the pharmacy this morning and made another phone call. This time I was able to speak to a pharmacist in house. 


She verified that my patient did come by twice last week trying to fill the hydrocodone prescription from the spine surgeon (rejected) and then my prescription. She said each time the pharmacy manager looked at the hydrocodone script and followed his clinical judgment on whether it should be filled. 


She said this pharmacy manager (also a pharmacist) had been at this Walgreens for about 2-3 weeks and implemented a new policy regarding scheduled substances where they would be reviewed and he himself would decide if they should be filled. So in the last 2-3 weeks they've been getting a lot of complaints filed. **Also he had initiated a policy where the reason for rejection would be documented, however the pharmacist checked and he did not document either rejection.** She does remember the prescriptions being rejected because she was present at the time the patient was turned away. She sounded very unimpressed with her colleague's actions. He won't be there until after 2pm today so I will call again to see what red flags he remembers seeing...since he didn't document anything...",75,231,2016-03-14,PHARMA,0.10344575345516205,0.8719834685325623,0.02457079477608204

medicine,Pharmacy refusing to fill pain medication prescriptions for my patient - UPDATE #2,"[original  thread] (https://redd.it/49xm3y)

[update 1](https://redd.it/4adg7r)


It turns out while my patient was getting his prescription rejected last week, he actually called my office to tell my MA what was going on and she offered to talk to the pharmacy manager. She heard the patient speak to the pharmacy manager and then he told her ""He doesn't want to talk to you."" She remembered his name, which is an important point that comes up later. 


I called Walgreens and asked to speak to the pharmacy manager last night. I introduced myself as Dr. Notmydoc and told him my patient had had his prescription denied last week and I was following up on why. After giving him the patient's name and birth date I could hear him shuffling through something and he said to someone ""she didn't document this where I can find it easily."" Unable to find the documentation for my prescription, he zoomed in on the prescription written by my colleague 5 days prior, as that one was documented. We then started in a round and round argument where he started reading the Good Faith policy from Walgreens verbatim to me. I interrupted him to tell him that I know he has the right to reject a prescription, but I wanted to know WHY my prescription was rejected. He did not appreciate being interrupted. ""Ma'am! Ma'am! I AM TELLING YOU WHY! STOP INTERRUPTING ME! STOP INTERRUPTING ME! I AM TRYING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION! *goes back to reading the Walgreens policy out loud like it's the Declaration of Independence* I listened to more gibberish about his good faith rights because every time I tried to redirect to my actual question, he complained I was interrupting him. He complained that I needed to let him finish speaking and to show him the respect that he was showing me. I pointed out that if he really respected me he would have called me Dr. Notmydoc instead of Ma'am. I don't know if he thought he could steamroll and intimidate me with bluster because I am an Asian woman but it just made me more annoyed. 


**He then informed me that he had never seen my prescription.** That's right, he claimed he was not there the day my prescription got rejected. This is in spite of the patient's wife recalling his name as the person she talked to, my MA on the other line hearing his name as the pharmacist there, and the staff pharmacist telling me yesterday that he was the one who rejected my prescription. He said ""Ma'am, you can believe I was there if you want to but I was not there."" I asked him then why did all these other people recall him being there, and he stood firm. I asked him point blank if he thought his staff pharmacist and my patient were lying. He said they were wrong. 


At that point he must have pulled up my patient's DPS report (Aha, he was filibustering for time)  and he told me the reason for rejecting the patient's prescription was that he has a history of taking hydrocodone over the course of several months and ""Studies show that opioid use over 16 week is not effective treatment for pain."" Now, I had called the patient first yesterday to verify chain of events and it turns out that's what he had told the patient's wife as well - that since her husband had been taking this medication longer than 4-6 months he couldn't get it any more. Seeing as we had been arguing on the phone the whole time, I think it's more likely the DPS report jogged his memory than the alternate storyline he was suggesting, which was a different pharmacist rejected my prescription and failed to document it and everyone involved wrongfully said it was him. And then he independently came up with the same idea? Not likely. 


I told him the purpose of the DEA guidelines was to prevent opioid abusers and drug dealers from getting their hands on narcotics, and whether or not a patient receives pain relief from hydrocodone after 16 weeks is under my clinical judgment, not his. He disagreed. I told him he was overstepping the intent of Good Faith and he disagreed. 


What pisses me off is, he could have rejected the spine surgeon's prescription on the same guideline and it would have been less work than calling the office to find out the patient's plan of care. That one was rejected on the basis of the prescriber transferring care to another doctor (me). Which really makes me think he's not using clinical judgment, he's looking for excuses to not fill prescriptions - even valid ones. 


Why does this matter? It's easy to say to a patient ""go fill your prescription at a different pharmacy."" Some people have insurance plans that require them to fill it at Walgreens because they have an agreement, and taking it elsewhere means the prescription becomes more expensive. If you need to take a medication every month, that crap adds up and you are paying your insurance premiums without getting the expected benefits. But I also feel strongly as a practitioner that looking for excuses to withhold medication is unethical. I know pharmacists are worried about getting in trouble with the DEA - you think I don't worry about that myself? I kicked two patients out of my clinic today because one was very likely selling his meds and the other was multisourcing, but I don't take that out on the next patient. Treat people like people. 


So:
1) While the pharmacy manager was refusing to fill my prescription he turned down my MA's offer to discuss it on the phone
2) He didn't document his reason for denying the prescription
3) He claimed he was not there after he realized there was no documentation and tried to pin it on another pharmacist
4) His reasoning for why my patient should not receive pain medications is chilling: he's taken it for more than 16 weeks so it doesn't treat his pain anymore.


For these reasons I do intend to report it to the pharmacy board. I will leave it up to them to decide if he has acted improperly. Most likely nothing will happen, but at least it would establish a paper trail and maybe the 5th person to file a complaint will have an impact. 


There have been a lot of people saying it's not the pharmacist's fault, that he's been put in a bad position. I think this guy is just an asshole and really not worth defending from a professional standpoint. It may seem traitorous to other healthcare professionals but if I don't advocate for my patients, who the hell is going to do it?",85,262,2016-03-16,PHARMA,0.18670199811458588,0.7869622707366943,0.026335707865655422

medicine,Let's talk about narcotic prescriptions,"As a urology resident, I write a lot of prescriptions for narcotics postoperatively. We as residents are given a lot of freedom to decide what type of narcs to prescribe and how much and I was recently shocked to learn how many pills some of my fellow residents are writing for. 

I've been trying to be more judicious in my narcotic prescribing and I usually write for 45 percocet for more painful stuff like flank incisions and IPPs, 20 vicodin on discharge for abdominal surgeries and about 20 T#3's for smaller scrotal stuff. Of course there's a lot of variation but that's what I've been doing in general.  I've also been trying out some other stuff like gabapentin that our pain management service always recommends. 

I've been using percocet or vicodin rather than oxy without APAP b/c I've been told it's makes them harder to abuse because people don't want to OD on APAP but I'm not sure how true that is. Also is there any real difference between percocet and vicodin in terms of addiction potential? 

I thought this might be a good place for people to discuss what their practices and beliefs are on this topic.  Except ArmyOrtho and other orthopods. When I was an intern on trauma I occasionally wrote for 100s (!) of oxycodone for long bone fractures and other polytrauma.

pharmacy,Ketorolac: Why does it cause more/severe (expected) side effects compared to the other NSAIDs?,"Ketorolac therapy in the US is limited to 5 days, because after those 5 days, it's been found that there is an increase in both the incidence and severity of NSAID-typical side effects, including GI events.

* *What is it* about ketorolac that causes the risk of severe NSAID-typical side effects to increase so much after just 5 days?

Compared to other NSAIDs, ketorolac doesn't stand out:

* *p*K(a) (3.5)

* plasma protein binding (~99%)

* elimination half-life (~4-9 hrs.)

* onset of action (PO: 2-3 hrs.; IV/IM: ~10 min.)

* accumulation (healthy adults: minimal to none)

The only things that *maybe* stand out are:

* bioavailability (100% PO)

* dose-response relationship (direct, weak)

* dose-duration relationship (direct, strong)

My hypothesis:
 
Since the dose-response relationship is so weak, COX becomes saturated. Steady state is achieved in ~4 days; with prolonged therapy, COX is *constantly* and completely inhibited. Therefore, at any given site, it is much more likely that there will be a relative deficiency of prostaglandins (compared to other, non-saturating NSAIDs), and thus, the high incidence and severity of side effects (like GI bleeds).

Does that seem plausible? Do you think there's something else that could be causing it? Are the risks overblown?",19,30,2016-03-27,PHARMA,0.078760527074337,0.8894659876823425,0.03177349641919136

medicine,Autoimmune diseases and hypersensitivity reactions: Logic or Memorisation?,"There are 4 kinds of hypersensitivity reactions, each of which is related to different kinds of auto-immune diseases or allergies. For example, vasculitis is typically type III, while contact dermatitis is type IV, and pemphigus vulgaris is type II. 

My question is as follows: Is there any logic to this? Why is contact dermatitis (CD) Type IV, while it looks like a rash and is triggered by exogenous antigens. If I hadn't known that CD is type IV, I would have reasoned that it is type I. My reasons would be that CD is triggered by an exogenous antigen (the contact), produces a quick reaction with redness (typical of a rash, type I), but this reasoning is false. I understand the immunological principles behind each hypersensitivity reaction, but I don't see the logic as to why certain auto-immune diseases belong to the type of hypersensitivity that they belong to.

medicine,"How should I deal with this situation on OB as a student? Suck it up and ignore it, or talk to my attending?","A little background first: I'm a male third year student on my OBGYN rotation working with a private practice doctor. My attending (also male) is awesome and has been great to work with and includes me in everything. However, his nurse seems to have a problem with me (overheard her complaining about me to another nurse when she didn't know I was already at the clinic), which is fine by me. I'm not interested in doing OB, but I do my best to try and be helpful and learn as much as possible. The same day I heard her complaining, I was standing in the hallway waiting to talk with my attending when a patient who was wearing a hospital gown was walking back to her room. The nurse then told me 3x, in front of the patient, ""not to look"" and only after that did she tell the patient that it was okay for her to walk by. To be honest I was a little upset and frustrated. I get that I may not be what she thinks is the ideal version of a champion of women's health, but that doesn't mean I'm not a professional who cares about patient privacy. It felt like she was implying that I was some pervert that if she hadn't been there would be ogling the patient as she walked by. And I also felt like she was positively reinforcing any fears that this patient had that me as med student would be acting inappropriately.

So here's the deal meddit, should I talk with my attending about this or not. I'm completely open to the (very) likely possibility that my small, fragile med student ego getting a slight bruising but then again I'm not sure.

From some surverys, most doctors appreciate EBM and guidelines as what they should be useful guidelines that can be taken into account, but not replace a physicians thining. In recent years, it seems more doctors are moving away from thinking and researching and relying on these guidelines to avoid suit, obviously due to the medicolegal industry. Some physician educators feel that we are going to kill the high quality of care this country receives by standardizing everything and not letting doctors ""think"". I have had some of my PhD friends make fun of me saying MDs don't get to think, I didn't think they were right before but in the direction we are going they may be right. What do you all think, any opinion, from medical student, to resident, to attending. I would love opinions from medical students especially because we are trying to see if our study could potentially influence physician education in the future(of course it won't though).",42,12,2016-03-28,PHARMA,0.028264379128813744,0.9268959164619446,0.044839754700660706
