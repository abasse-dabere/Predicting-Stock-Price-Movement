pharmacy,To all pharmacy employees - I need to get this off my chest,"Obligatory - on mobile. Apologies if formatting sucks or if I’m breaking any rules (let me know and I’ll fix what I can. 

So I spend ALOT of time in doctors offices and pharmacy’s because I got the short end of the stick when it comes to the bad genes in my family. Now, with that out of the way I just wanted to say...

Thank you all. Thanks for always being there when I need you. I personally think one of the most noble things a person can do is to help others. Not only do y’all do that all day every day, you do it selflessly, put yourselves in crippling debt going to college, continuing your education for the rest of your lives, watch after me to make sure I’m not at risk for unnecessary health issues. And you (much more so than doctors in my personal experience) do it not for the pay check, but because you genuinely love what you do and care about others. 

Thank you for working tirelessly. Thank you for always being there. Thank you for watching out for me even when I can’t be bothered. Thank you for putting up with all of those drug seeking addicted assholes who don’t give a shit how many people they hurt and keeping them separated from the rest of us. Thank you for putting up with my shitty insurance company who (seemingly) does anything they can to be a pain in your ass and not letting it effect the level of care and professionalism I get from you. But most importantly of all, thank you for being you. Healthcare in the US is a crap shoot at best. It’s beyond comforting to know that no matter how sick I or my family may get, I can always come to you all and get the best possible information and care. Were it not for you all, I’d have lost several family members and I probably wouldn’t be here either.

medicine,how do you deal with racist patients ?,"So i am an Indian doctor in the US. patient is 70's female , italian origin, gi bleed, dvt. etc etc (sorta sick). in room with her 40's daughter.

as soon as i enter, i sanitize my hands and begin to touch her. she immediately withdraws her hand away and demands me wear gloves. I try to reply , but then i am like ok, i dont care.. in a few minutes, she also confirmed if i was indian and i said yes.

in order to keep the story short, i wont focus on the weird medical and bullshit questions they asked.

Here is the racist part.

The next time I went into the room, she didnt care if i wore gloves or not. instead focused on if i have children. I said , yes , i do. she asked me to show her a picture. at this point, the conversation was going nicely and she was less of an asshole to me than before, so i was like , sure here is a photo. then she goes like ..... awww , she is a cutie *( thats a good start)*, she looks like a model....( *even better, don't screw up*)....... she looks american, doesnt even look Indian ........ (***There, you did it)***

&amp;#x200B;

Then she proceeds to ask me if my wife is american , ( apparently because the baby looked too white to be Indian)

&amp;#x200B;

And as an icing on the cake, she also asked me when did I come to this country , because my english was very good, at which i told her, US is not the only country where they speak english... she also told me that some of the doctors she had encountered did not speak as well.......

&amp;#x200B;

I was beyond furious but exited the room gracefully !!

&amp;#x200B;

Today, something new happened that made me totally forget how bad my saturday was. 

There was a troublesome patient that was  assigned to me today. Met him for the first time. I went to see him and  he immediately demanded pain medications. I said without properly  assessing you, it will not be the best practice to give you pain  medication as it might negatively impact your health. At this point, he  became verbally abusive, including calling me a ""Mother F-word B-word  Ass N-word P-word"" and a combination of those words repeatedly, after  accusing all doctors to be greedy.

I  insisted him to be polite, and asked him to cooperate, at which point he  threatened me that I would pay for this and to suck his D , among other  abuses. Till this time, its pretty much another day at the hospital, so  I wasnt too bothered by it.

When i asked him to cooperate again, he upped his rhetoric and this is what he said in exact words -

**""I  am gonna do my homework, find out where you live and send 40 Mother  F-word N-word to your home to kill your family in the night""**

At  which point, I just left the room, called security and escorted the pt  out. I wrote a detailed note in the chart, emailed my supervisors.

I  later called city police and asked to file a report. The cop took my  statement and asked his detective, who said, its not a felony yet, but  you can go to the DA office and file a Private Criminal Complaint and  gave me a report number and state crime victim compensation form.

I  am usually not too concerned about these threats, but because he laid  out his threat so specifically and detailed manner, it does make me a  little concerned. He is almost 45 year old, and large built, so it will  not be unusual if he jumps in a parking lot or has me followed to my  home. I am also surprised that the detective thought it was not  significant enough to do something about it. One of my friend told me to  get a restraining order but it would entail me giving out my exact home  address to him , which frankly is stupid because he wont come himself  but can send anyone else to hurt me.

(Because I sure as hell don't have one). I mean, what the fuck are we supposed to do about the patients?

Someone came up with ""I think we're supposed to close the patient doors,"" so we ran around and did that, someone grabbed the safety manual. There's no other mechanism to lock our unit down.

Somehow, I think I became *de facto* in charge (*picture a short, relatively un-athletic gal with coke-bottle glasses and a high pitched voice calling the plays to understand how truly ridiculous this was*). Luckily there was only one sick patient on the floor who was on the stable side, so I got all the RNs and techs into the resident workroom while we tried to figure out an exit strategy. Both of our main stairwells descend right to the general area the active shooter could be, and all of this took enough time that it probably wasn't safe to move anymore. We committed to hiding in our coded-door resident room, barricaded the door with the HIPAA shred box, the printer and the mini-fridge, turned the pagers and phones to silent, got everyone on the floor. We probably only sat there for 15-20 minutes, but it felt longer.

Maybe all of you in bigger cities or at trauma centers with a lot of numbers see this more often, but **I cannot remember the last time I had been so scared**. Like there's that ""oh shit, oh shit"" moment when you're running to a critical patient, or right before a code when you see things going downhill. But I can't remember the last time I had been this afraid. I had a room full of fifteen 20-something nurses and techs and an intern and I felt responsible for every last one of them. I don't think I was even thinking about the patients--these RNs and techs have a great relationship with our department in general and with me personally-- all I could think of was ""how the fuck do I get these people out of here?""

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually we had the all clear. Turned out the shooter hadn't entered the hospital (shot himself outside after his victims got away), wasn't in any way connected with hospital personnel, and all staff and patients were safe, which is obviously the best possible outcome for a shitty situation. I work with a great bunch of RNs and techs and felt very lucky to be working with a great team--the kind that would have worked together if shit had actually hit the fan. I had my usual stress response (cry in a call room for 5 minutes), called my parents so they wouldn't freak out in the morning, and on we went with work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to think. I've become used to some of the daily, minor injustices of life as a resident--asshole patients, crappy call schedules, co residents you can't trust... I was never expecting this. I can't even imagine what things have been like for those who work in Chicago and the Bronx where doctors have been killed in the last year. There's an inherent unfairness to this--we shouldn't have to be scared to lose our lives at work. That's the only real thought that sticks in my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

pharmacy,r/pharmacy 2019 Demographics Survey,"After seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/a3cn0z/i_have_always_been_curious_as_to_who_lurks_the/) today, I updated the old r/pharmacy demographics survey from a couple of years ago based on the answers given and some feedback I received back then. I'll keep the [survey link](https://goo.gl/forms/ay8B23L6ihrl7Ns32) open until the evening of **Sunday, December 16th** for anyone who wants to respond.

A few important points:

1. All responses are completely optional - you can answer as many or as few questions as you like. That being said, please know that your responses are anonymous (ie, not tied to your Google account even if you are logged in).
2. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE try to select from the multiple choice responses whenever possible. I've provided a lot of ""Other"" write in options, but please only use that if you truly feel that the provided multiple choice responses don't capture your response. This helps me not have to go back and perform as much data cleaning afterward.
3. You may see that you skip certain pages during the survey - this is intentional. Based on the answers you select, you will get directed to different sections of the survey.

I will try to post survey responses within about two weeks or so of receiving all the responses, but with the holidays it might be pushed back even further than that.

Please feel free to provide any feedback! (Note, I won't be updating the survey questions since it will mess up the responses already submitted - but I'll take it into account for any possible future surveys.)

medicine,Pharmacist being careful or overstepping her position?,"I'm a MD specializing in fertility. Today, a patient undergoing fertility treatment also had a URI with a lot of coughing and asked if I could call in a prescription for symptomatic relief. My nurse called in Cheratussin (with Codeine). The pharmacist refused, saying that a medication with codeine can't be called in. So I hand-wrote and signed a prescription on my pad and when she went to pick it up, my patient was told by the pharmacist that they can't fill it because I am a fertility doctor and this should be written by a PCP, as it is outside my ""scope of practice"". That was a direct quote from her when my nurse called and asked for clarification as to why they are rejecting the prescription. For 20 years, in addition to a lot of fertility medications, I've also been been regularly prescribing anitbacterials for UTI's, Diflucan for candida. And every single patient gets Valium prior to their embryo transfer. So I write for that over 100x per year. And today, some pharmacist is telling my nurse that ""Cough medicines shouldn't be prescribed by a fertility doctor. It should be prescribed by a primary care doctor or PA"". Anyway, it's the end of a busy day and I thought I would vent. It doesn't affect me. It just inconveniences my poor patient who is already dealing with the stresses of infertility treatment and it amuses me because it came as quite a surprise.

Update: I was almost looking forward to having a professional discussion with this pharmacist, but my NP took care of it. The pharmacist (who my NP said sounded kind of uptight) decided to fill the prescription ""just this one time"" but ""Don't do it again. Next time have the patient go to their PCP"", they told us. That was my entertainment for the day. :)

UPDATE: I respect most pharmacists and have gotten useful information from them when I proactively asked them for their help. In this case, I didn't ask for help. After piecing together the events, I conclude that this pharmacist was not malicious. I really think she was just a scared corporate employee who stuck by the ""I must follow orders"" mentality, as some of you have suggested. The fact that healthcare has gradually drifted towards that type of mentality is a much bigger problem and a whole other conversation. Thanks for all the comments.

medicine,Resident Struggles with Procedures,"I am a new staff and work closely with a lot of residents. I work in a procedure heavy surgical field. We always do our best to make sure our procedures are performed safely that pain is minimized. This includes IV meds prior to procedures, local anesthetic, regional blocks, topical anesthetic, peri-procedure anxiety medications. I am very familiar with procedural pain management and I am quite sensitive to the issue

Procedures we commonly perform include: Dressing changes, I &amp; D of wounds laceration closure, fracture reductions etc. We always address anxiety and anesthesia for the procedure prior and during. The truth is however some things will be uncomfortable.

I am currently working with a junior resident however who is VERY uncomfortable causing any discomfort to patients. We have worked together several times and whenever a patient shows any signs of discomfort with a procedure the resident locks up and stops the procedure - often against the benefit of the patient.. The person will not continue even with coaxing. He also has clear concerns performing these procedures and questions it every single time to the point I think he is avoiding them on call, and somehow thinks we are causing unnecessary pain to patients. 

How would you address this with a junior resident in a surgical field? My concern is they are so sensitive to the issue that they avoid making the appropriate clinical decision.

pharmacy,Cheer up guys. The grass isn’t always greeener.,"Some Monday motivation for you all. Everyone in this forum is SO down on themselves and idealizes other jobs or professions. 

Those 9-5 jobs and “easy” gigs aren’t all that either. I have so many friends who would kill for my schedule and can’t stand their office job. In fact, it’s pretty universal. You can say “they haven’t worked retail they’d appreciate it” but really I think it’s just human nature to preferably not have to work anywhere. A job is a job. It’s a means to an end and there is no perfect job. I don’t think I’ve heard anyone “love” their 9-5 gig. Sure it’s got its perks but working less days as a pharmacist is pretty nice too! 

We make a difference in people’s lives. Yeah maybe it’s something small but that feeling when a patient shows appreciation (I’m in retail) is so heartwarming and reminds me why we do this. People appreciate us more than we realize. It’s easy to focus on the 5% of people who are negative and angry but most aren’t. 

Yeah school sucks and we spend a lot on loans for a declining job market but we still make a comfortable living and way more than the poor technicians who deal with the brunt of the work. We aren’t driving maseratis but we aren’t starving or impoverished like many people in the world are. 


So cheer up people and stand up for our profession! I just felt the need to post this cause the negativity here is strong. Be proud! There’s a lot we have to fix but also a lot to be grateful for.",70,338,2018-12-10,PHARMA,0.0339462086558342,0.9060771465301514,0.05997668579220772

pharmacy,New Two Step Verification at the Three Letter + My Entire Thoughts on the Company After 1 Year as a Tech,"**Background:**

Every tech at my store is amazing, I love each and every single one of them. We all rotate stations, can quickly and accurately type and fill prescriptions, we know all of our regulars and they enjoy seeing us, and on top of that our pharmacists are top notch and have splendid attitudes. We usually have no red prescriptions, fill around 200-300+ prescriptions in a day, give plenty of flu shots, manage to get our hands on the good stuff (shingrix) every once in a while, and customers usually don't have to wait longer than 15 minutes if they would like to wait, or around 30 minutes for C2's.

**With that being said:** 

Today was the second day of the new double verification method at my store. 

 **Positives:**

It makes a lot of sense. I like the fact that new prescriptions that we don't have in stock must be verified before going into QI. Nothing is worse than ordering a drug and then realizing it won't go through because something was wrong with the script and it wasn't caught because it didn't get verified.

**Negatives:**

However, it almost felt like today that the workload was doubled. Readyfills needing to be verified before being able to print out of QP? Pointless. Keep Readyfills with the original structure.

Prescriptions that were re-billed because of a coupon or an insurance change needing to now go to QV to verify the hardcopy, then to QP to print a new label, back to QV to get the drug itself verified again, and then finally back to the waiting bin? Pointless. Please let me print the RX and verify it out so I can fucking sell it and get to the next customer.

**Results:**

On top of it all, most of the time at my store there is only one pharmacist working a straight 13 hour shift. I felt so bad for my pharmacist today. Never even sat down to eat his lunch. Had a 100+ in the red. 

How is the pharmacist supposed to take voicemails, help production answer the phone, give consultations, now verify TWO queue's, and fill C2's?

We had red prescriptions, red prescriptions everywhere. It was so bad. 

 I know CVS is notorious for low tech hours, increased work volume, and demanding stats from corporate, but today made me reconsider my entire time spent working with the company. 

I feel spoiled because I know this is how it normally is for a lot of stores.

 On a busy Friday where we would need at least 4 - 5 techs to be busy but still comfortable, we ended up only having 3 at most, and 2 when we were on breaks. We even had people from the front store helping out on the register, bless their souls.

For about the past 2 months or so, I've noticed conditions slowly worsening, but today it clicked.

CVS doesn't care about you. CVS doesn't care about its customers. All they care about is money.

**The Sad Part:**

If CVS is not going to improve two step verification, then this is going to be a long road downhill. All it would take to solve this problem would simply be having two pharmacists at the same time.

One to take voicemails, verify hard copies, and give consultations,

and one to verify production, fill C2's, and complete transfers.

And for the love of God, let these men and women take a 15-30 minute break and at least step out of the pharmacy, use the restroom, get some fresh air, or just sit down.

**How I Feel:**

I still work with a sense of urgency, still take care of the customers as quickly as I can, do my best to remain positive, but yet day in and day out I never feel satisfied. I'm really starting to get burned out and not care anymore.

I worked 3 straight 10 hour days because someone was sick this week, 

Each of those days, to everyone else's disbelief, I took my 30 minute break and both of my 15 minute breaks. Each and every single time I requested my GUARANTEED paid 15 minute break to a particular pharmacist, they were hesitant and pissed to acknowledge that I was able to take it.

Guess what? I don't give a fuck how busy it is. If I'm going to be in this bitch for more than 8 hours, then you can bet your ass I'm going to take every break that is GUARANTEED to me.

This is how CVS wants it to be. They want us to struggle. It has even been made evident that our District Manager keeps hours so low so that he can get his bonus.
Every day he dogs us about PCQ calls, the new ""Burst"" calls, making sure we have above a certain percentage for readyfill, 90 day, etc. on the register.

I wish the CEO could spend one day in my pharmacist's shoes, but he never will. And it will never get better. And conditions will never improve.

**Conclusion:**

I'm on the verge of putting in my two weeks notice, leaving on good terms, taking the money I saved and going back to school full time, and finding something else to do. Because this shit really is not worth it.

**Your thoughts?**

How is two-step verification going at your store? 

Has it always been this bad?

Am I over reacting just because I've been protected from the wrath by finding a good CVS?

How are you doing?

Did you take your 15 minute break today? You know that shit is guaranteed right?

I'm eager to your thoughts and how you're doing at your store.

**TL;DR**:

My CVS has great techs and great pharmacists, but upcoming demands and updated operating system tools are slowing us down and causing problems, leaving me on the verge of having an aneurysm.",92,77,2018-12-15,PHARMA,0.08764564990997314,0.8632603287696838,0.04909402783960104

pharmacy,CVS is the Enron of healthcare,"For anyone thinking about working for CVS, I urge you to look elsewhere. 

The entire business model of CVS is based off of theft and deception. How long can a company like this last? I'm willing to bet that the house of cards comes crashing down within a year or two. 

For those who are unfamiliar with how they do business, they profit by forcing pharmacists to work so fast that it is dangerous to the patients. As an employee, this means you'll have higher stress levels and a much higher chance of making mistakes. Of course, when an inevitable error happens it is your fault (not CVS), and they won't hesitate to throw you under the bus. If you're a pharmacist, you are degrading yourself and your profession if you work for them.

If you're a patient, you probably aren't aware of how corners are cut in order to meet the company speed metrics. The way the business is run is unsafe, and you are putting yourself in danger by filling prescriptions at CVS. [You dont even need to take my word for it. The Chicago Tribune did some independent testing and CVS came in LAST compared to the chains in warning patients about dangerous drug interactions](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/druginteractions/ct-drug-interactions-pharmacy-met-20161214-story.html) CVS execs do not seem to care that they are killing patients in an effort to increase profits. 

CVS is actually worse than the tobacco companies. At least someone buying cigarettes will know about the health risks. Patients are generally not aware that CVS business practices put them in danger.

CVS also keeps getting [caught stealing](http://gatehousenews.com/sideeffects/ohio-medicaid-orders-drug-price-changes-abuse-reported/) from state medicaid, again and [again.](http://gatehousenews.com/sideeffects/home/site/dispatch.com) The company preaches ethics in its internal propaganda videos, but anyone who pays attention sees how they really operate. The company is run by sociopaths who will steal and kill in the name of corporate greed. Anyone who works for CVS and knows these things is an enabler.

My intern does the following:

He confabulates when he isn't sure. Doesn't say I don't know and ends up giving false or altered facts.

He's distracted most of the time. Doesn't pay attention to what other people are saying.

He doesn't confirm what is told to him and ends up doing something else then he gets defensive when he's questioned about it.

He's unreliable and I can't trust him as a source of information from patients, attendings and other ancillary staff members due to the above.

He's very slow and inefficient time manager.

He discontinues orders on his own without reviewing with senior doctors and with no evidence to support what he did or clear thought process.

He doesn't seem to know how to apply his medical knowledge or translate it into a plan.

...which was when I noticed that this was the boys’ curve and she was registered as a boy. She had been registered as male since her newborn visit and somehow, nobody had noticed this error over some 12 lifetime encounters. So I called up front and had them change the child’s sex in the system.

Please note that the numbers will not always add up to 100%, since all questions in the survey were optional.

**Location**

Surprising no one, the vast majority of respondents (583; 90.4%) were from the US. Next were Canada (33; 5.1%), UK (8; 1.2%), Australia (3; 0.5%), Brazil (2; 0.3%), and New Zealand (2; 0.3%); and then one person each from Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Lithuania, Malaysia, Norway, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and Syria.

Of the 583 Americans, the top three states were Texas (50; 8.6%), California (43; 7.4%), and Florida (36; 6.2%).

Of the 33 Canadians, the top three provinces were Ontario (12; 36.4%), British Columbia (6; 18.2%), and Quebec (4; 12.1%).

**Demographics**

Of the 645 respondents, 335 (51.9%) were male, and 308 (47.8%) were female.

Age distribution is shown in the below table. Some stats: minimum 15, maximum 66, mean 28.3, median 27, mode 26.

https://i.redd.it/jhggfw6qtf521.png

In terms of race/ethnicity, the top two categories were white (449; 69.6%) and Asian (116; 18.0%), followed by Hispanic or Latino (18; 2.8%), two or more races (18; 2.8%), Indian subcontinent (16; 2.5%), black (11; 1.7%), Arab (9; 1.4%), Native American or American Indian (2; 0.3%), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (1; 0.2%), and Middle Eastern (1; 0.2%).

**General employment questions**

Of the 645 respondents, 397 (61.6%) were pharmacists, 116 (18.0%) were pharmacy students, 91 (14.1%) were non-pharmacist staff (eg, pharmacy technicians, assistants, and cashiers), 19 (2.9%) were pre-pharmacy students, 9 (1.4%) were other healthcare professionals, 8 (1.2%) were non-healthcare professionals, and 3 (0.5%) chose ""other"".

Most respondents (439; 68.1%) were employed full time (defined as &gt; 30 hours), while 59 (9.1%) were employed part time. 118 respondents (18.3%) were full time students (not necessarily pharmacy), 10 (1.6%) were unemployed, and 7 (1.1%) were working outside of the field of pharmacy.

There was a fairly close split between respondents working in suburban (267; 41.4%) and urban (236; 36.6%) locations, followed far behind by those working in rural locations (85; 13.2%) or working from home/remotely (12; 1.9%).

A pie chart of primary place of employment is shown below, with the top five responses shown in the legend: community/retail (315; 48.8%), hospital including outpatient (171; 26.5%), unemployed (22; 3.4%), long-term care/hospice (16; 2.5%), and mail order/specialty/infusion (16; 2.5%). Please note that the unemployed category includes non-working full time students.

https://i.redd.it/tfzfap9csf521.png

A small proportion (120; 18.6%) of respondents reported having a second job. Of these, the most common fields of employment were: community/retail (31; 25.8%), non-pharmacy related job but not including self-employment (24; 20%), and hospital including outpatient (24; 20%).

**Salary**

For the following analyses, I only included those working full time, since including everyone would skew the data. Below is the histogram for pharmacist salary (worldwide). I did do a bit of data cleaning on this for what I felt were obvious data errors (eg, salary of $1,250,000 for a hospital pharmacist; if that was you and it was actually correct, bravo!).

https://i.redd.it/v80ileydsf521.png

As has been noted before on this subreddit, salaries for full time pharmacists were much higher in the US compared to ex-US. Here are the stats for the US: minimum $41,000; maximum $250,000; mean $120,600; median $122,000. And stats for ex-US: minimum $15 (I think/hope this was a data entry error, but I didn't know what was intended so I left it alone); maximum $105,000; mean $60,421; median $67,000.

And here's the histogram for full time non-pharmacist staff (worldwide):

https://i.redd.it/7ksvcb5fsf521.png

There was only one ex-US respondent in this category, so I included that person together with the Americans. Stats for full time non-pharmacist staff salaries: minimum $12,000; maximum $60,000; mean $35,264; median $35,000.

**Community/retail pharmacy**

Just under half (315; 48.8%) of respondents reported working in community/retail pharmacy. Of these, over half (172; 54.6%) worked in a chain, followed by supermarket (50; 15.9%), independent (45; 14.3%), big box (32; 10.2%), and wholesale club (11; 3.5%), as shown in the pie chart below (only top 5 responses shown in legend).

Roles within community/retail pharmacy are displayed below, again with only the top 5 responses shown in the legend.

**Hospital pharmacy (including hospital outpatient)**

There were 171 respondents (26.5%) who reported working in hospital pharmacy (including hospital outpatient). Bed count at their hospitals is shown in the graph below.

https://i.redd.it/psxm9yvisf521.png

Roles within hospital pharmacy are displayed below, with the top 5 responses shown in the legend.

https://i.redd.it/03ax28rjsf521.png

Of 140 hospital pharmacists, 55 (39.3%) had completed a residency, and 15 (10.7%) were currently completing their residencies. The other half (70; 50%) were not pursuing nor had ever completed a residency.

The top three clinical specialties were oncology (19 respondents), emergency medicine (11 respondents), and pediatrics (8 respondents). Note that it was possible to choose more than one specialty.

**Pharmaceutical industry**

Only 12 respondents (1.9%) reported working in the pharmaceutical industry. The breakdown by department was as follows: Marketing/Business Analytics (4; 33.3%), Medical/Scientific Affairs (3; 25%), Drug Safety and Risk Management/Pharmacovigilance (2; 16.7%), Medical Communications/Education/Information (2; 16.7%), and Medical Science Liaison (1; 8.3%). The breakdown by level was as follows: Associate/Specialist (5; 41.7%), Manager/Supervisor (5; 41.7%), and Director (2; 16.7%).

**Pharmacy and pre-pharmacy students**

There were 137 respondents who reported being pharmacy or pre-pharmacy students. Of these, the top three desired fields following graduation were hospital including residencies (43; 31.4%), community/retail (33; 24.1%), and undecided (16; 11.7%).

These 137 students were attending (or planned to attend) 72 different schools worldwide. The three most common schools reported were Duquesne University (5; 3.6%), University of Missouri at Kansas City (4; 2.9%), and Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (4; 2.9%).

The 137 students were broken down pretty evenly by year: 28 (20.4%) were undergraduates/pre-pharmacy, 23 (16.8%) were PY1, 24 (17.5%) were PY2, 29 (21.2%) were PY3, and 32 (23.4%) were PY4. Seventeen PY4 students reported having a job lined up for after graduation, most (15; 88.2%) in a community/retail setting (disclaimer: I'm not sure this question was answered correctly, because I also got 32 ""no"" responses despite having only 32 PY4 students total).

Of the 137 students, 107 (78.1%) were currently working in a pharmacy setting, while 29 (21.2%) were not. Statistics for the approximate number of hours worked per week were: minimum 2; maximum 45; mean 16.5; and median 15.

**Pharmacists**

As stated above, 397 (61.6%) of all respondents were pharmacists, from 118 different pharmacy schools. The three most common alma maters were: University of Illinois at Chicago (10; 2.5%), Duquesne University (8; 2.0%), and University of Pittsburgh (8; 2.0%).

The vast majority of pharmacists (363; 91.4%) were currently practicing pharmacy. Thirteen (3.3%) had practiced in the past but were no longer practicing, while 18 (4.5%) had never practiced after graduating. Of those currently practicing pharmacy, the statistics on the number of years in practice were as follows: minimum 0.1; maximum 39; mean 4.4; and median 3.

The highest pharmacy degree held by respondents were as follows: doctorate (356; 89.7%), master's (8; 2.0%), bachelor's (29; 7.3%), and Staatsexamen (1; 0.3%).

The most common postgraduate training completed or being pursued by respondents were: PGY-1 residencies (94; 23.7%), Board of Pharmacy Specialties (59; 14.9%), PGY-2 residencies (24; 6.0%), Master of Science (8; 2.0%), and Master of Business Administration (6; 1.5%). Note that respondents could choose more than one postgraduate training option.

The most common Board of Pharmacy Specialties were: Pharmacotherapy (60), Critical Care Pharmacy (9), Geriatric Pharmacy (7), Oncology Pharmacy (6), and Ambulatory Care Pharmacy (6). Note that respondents could choose more than one BPS certification.

**Pharmacy residents**

One hundred respondents stated that they had either completed or were currently pursuing a pharmacy residency. Of those, there were 14 current PGY-1 residents, three current PGY-2 residents, and 81 respondents who had completed their residencies.

Of the 14 current PGY-1 residents, six (42.9%) planned to pursue a PGY-2 residency, three (21.4%) planned to work as inpatient staff pharmacists, and three (21.4%) planned to work as inpatient clinical specialty pharmacists.

The three PGY-2 residents were specialized in critical care, emergency medicine, and oncology.

Of the 81 respondents who had completed their residencies, 18 (22.2%) had done both a PGY-1 and a PGY-2 residency. The most common PGY-2 residency specialties were: informatics (3; 16.7%), critical care (3; 16.7%), and emergency medicine (3; 16.7%). Immediately after completing their residencies, the most common career paths were: inpatient staff pharmacist (28; 34.6%), inpatient clinical specialty pharmacist (25; 30.9%), outpatient pharmacist (8; 7.4%), and ambulatory care pharmacist (8; 7.4%).

**Thoughts about the field of pharmacy**

Our three favorite things about the field of pharmacy were: helping patients (242; 37.5%), interest in science/opportunities for learning (202; 31.3%), and the pay (82; 12.7%).

Our three least favorite things about the field of pharmacy were: corporate-mandated metrics (192; 29.8%), bad patient interactions (141; 21.9%), and health insurance/PBM issues (111; 17.2%).

The top three improvements that we felt would have the most impact were: decreasing the number of pharmacy schools and/or imposing class size limits (157; 24.3%), improved staffing (132; 20.5%), and improved working conditions (67; 10.4%).

**Closing thoughts**

Thank you again to all of you who participated! If there's any statistic you'd like to know about that wasn't posted here (eg, what's the average salary of a PGY1 resident?), please feel free to ask!

I would ideally like to run this survey again in the future, so I'm happy to accept any feedback you may have. In particular, some people noted that the survey was very geared toward community and also very US-centric, which are very legitimate comments. Unfortunately, those are the areas I'm more familiar with - so PLEASE feel free to reach out with any questions you'd like to see in the future.

Another comment I received was that the term ""ancillary staff"" was perceived as demeaning. I want to apologize for any hurt I may have caused by using that term; it's simply the term that my state's pharmacy laws and regulations use to refer to non-pharmacist staff, and I didn't give any thought to how it could be perceived - so please accept my apologies.

In terms of repetition in the questions - unfortunately, part of that is the form design, because I needed to re-ask questions in order to direct people to different sections of the survey. Sorry about that!

Hope you all enjoyed the results, and again please let me know if you have any questions or comments! Cheers!",34,287,2018-12-19,PHARMA,0.05492028221487999,0.9115062554677328,0.033573453625043236

medicine,Infectious disease reading,"ID experts, what would you recommend as a starter for someone interested to learn more about ID?

That really goes back to the basics but in a clinically relevant manner. That goes to the simple things that common people misunderstand or get wrong. There’s a lot of stuff I pickup by hearsay from my ID people but I want to be able to say I heard it from somewhere other than so and so.

Addressing questions such as:

How to interpret if a culture is just colonisation or a real infection (based on the identified bug itself, how the culture was taken, the culture count, other labs like CRP, that procal is only validated in Respiratory infection, symptoms and signs) and therefore whether to treat or not

Things like ESBL and Amp-Cs. For example, first heard about the merino-1 trial from reddit and learnt that you shouldn’t use Pip-Tazo to treat ESBL organisms. But I also learnt from my local ID peeps that this applies only to bacteremic patients because of the trial, and they don’t consider this to extrapolate to treatment of non-lifethhreatening (even if limb threatening) infectious like osteomyelitis. I had a patient with a ceftriaxone resistant osteomyelitis patient that they recommended Augmentin for because it was sensitive on the culture, and I had no idea how to decide if I should believe them or not. And I can’t imagine how many other phenotypes of antibiotic resistance that can be recognised that I don’t know about.

The principles of how one actually constructs an empirical antibiotic guideline so I can really understand my hospital guidelines and their limitations, so that I can get more creative when first and second line options are contraindicated for some reason, and I can tell if an alternative is inferior (but acceptable given the clinical scenario) or just as good etc. For example, in a gen ward population if your local resistance to antibiotic A is less than X%, you can use it empirically, otherwise consider using antibiotic B, but if they are really sick as hell and dying please just use antibiotic B straightaway or even A+B for double coverage, and whether this is actually evidence based or not. (E.g. double antipseudomonal coverage for neutropenic fever not proven benefit)

Books with really cool nuggets of truth get bonus points! These often tend to be old timey books that aren’t necessarily evidence based but are so well-informed by experience. Other books with this feel are Sapira’s art and science and Cope’s early diagnosis of acute abdomen. I hear little nuggets of truth here and there from my ID people that I have never read before but which are said with such frank conviction I’m convinced it’s true. For example, the rule that dengue fever always lasts less than 7 days (and the exceptions to the rule that prove it).",25,40,2018-12-19,PHARMA,0.06105726584792137,0.910474956035614,0.028467826545238495

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Gabapentin Becomes a Schedule V Controlled Substance in Michigan*  
&gt;  
&gt;Although gabapentin is not federally recognized as a controlled substance, the Michigan Board of Pharmacy has determined that in order to protect the well-being of Michigan residents, all gabapentin containing products shall be placed under schedule V controlled substances class. The current Controlled Substances Rules were revised to include gabapentin under schedule V and are now in the process of being filed with the Secretary of State. The rule will become effective seven days after filing with the Secretary of State. MPA will notify members of the effective date.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Once effective, all prescribers and dispensers of gabapentin must comply with the legal standards of controlled substances. Note that the drug must be inventoried as of the effective date of scheduling. The inventory is then incorporated into the current controlled substance inventory. Thereafter, gabapentin shall be included in each annual inventory.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The prescribing and dispensing of gabapentin will be limited to those registered with the DEA. Pharmacists shall ensure that the prescription includes the required information, such as the prescriber's DEA registration number. All gabapentin prescriptions written under delegated authority shall include the name and DEA number of the prescriber along with the name and DEA number of the delegating prescriber. Information regarding the dispensing of each gabapentin prescription must be submitted to Michigan Automated Prescription System (MAPS). The transferring of gabapentin prescriptions between two DEA registered pharmacies can only be carried out once, as defined under 21 CFR 1306.25, unless the two pharmacies share an electronic database. If the latter, then the prescription can be transferred up to the maximum number of refills. Prescriptions written for gabapentin may include up to five refills.

- PRESCRIBERS ARE EXPECTED TO WORK BUSINESS HOURS, PHARMACISTS ARE EXPECTED TO WORK ALL HOURS. This imbalance unjustly punishes pharmacists, again and again and again. By now most Doctors and staff have a basic understanding of the prior-auth rules, and prescribe accordingly, but restrictions are getting more unpredictable everyday (PA requirements for GENERICS). Unfortunately, most patients choose to pick up prescriptions at their convenience, in the evenings or on weekends. Should any issues arise in terms of coverage, dosage, or directions, the pharmacist is required to call and straighten things out with the doctor before dispensing. Since doctors offices are usually closed during the evening and on weekends, the pharmacist is left to explain to the patient why they’ll need to wait a few days for their Rx. This conversation is rarely pleasant, and can lead to continuous altercations between entitled patients and pharmacists. Now the pharmacist is seen as the “bad guy” purely because he is the only person available. In addition, some doctors offer false information regarding copays or coverage to patients. These patients often argue when pharmacists tell them that the doctor was incorrect, ""But my doctor said! Just do it!"". Instead of blaming the doctor for poor information, they direct their anger at the pharmacist. It makes no sense.

&amp;nbsp;

- IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK TO A DOCTOR. As a receptionist, it is our job to screen calls to save time for the doctor. My first week on the job I learned that if another doctor calls, he is immediately put through to the doctor. The week following, a pharmacist called to verify directions on a prescription, and so I put him through to the doctor immediately the way I would with a doctor. After the phone call, the doctor took me aside. He said that if a pharmacist were to call again, I was to take a message and call back later to inform them of  his response. This made it clear how little respect he had for pharmacists, and that attitude trickled down to his employees. For example, my coworker would frequently toss or shred faxes from pharmacies that she didn’t feel like dealing with. Other doctors offices claim to be “very busy” and may not respond for days if at all. All the pharmacy can do is wait and bear the brunt of the dissatisfied patients. 

&amp;nbsp;

- INSURANCE COMPANIES RUN THE GAME WHILE REMAINING UNREACHABLE. Complex formularies cut costs for insurance providers, but they create a headache for everyone else. Insurance companies often require prior authorizations to determine whether a drug is covered or not. PA responses can take anywhere from 1 to 3 days, leaving frustrated patients without treatment. Approvals are still only valid for a year or so, meaning the entire process must be repeated annually for each drug and each patient for no reason (other than hoping you won't bother). Do the insurance companies call the patients and let them know all of this? Never. That nightmare is left to pharmacists and doctors offices, who are tasked with calling patients to deliver the bad news and absorb any frustration. Even phone calls to insurance companies are useless across the board. After a half hour of prompts and hold-music, a customer service representative comes on the line. These reps are powerless within the company, and complaining to them is a waste of time. Mostly they reiterate coverage information and “apologize for the inconvenience”. Policy writers and medical directors don't pick up phones.

&amp;nbsp;

- THE PUBLIC HAS NO IDEA WHAT PHARMACISTS ACTUALLY DO. No they aren’t errantly throwing pills in a bottle. I don’t know the process but I know that they are responsible for so much more. Pharmacists are responsible for drug interactions screening, providing counsel to anyone who wanders inside, taking verbal orders by phone, overseeing technicians, diffusing emotional customers, verifying insurance coverage, and so much more. The amount of prescriptions coming in has skyrocketed in recent years as well, meaning MORE calls, MORE fills, and MORE pills, and the same amount of time to get it done. Pharmacy staff work their fingers to the bone just to hear, “What took so long? You’re only putting a few pills in a bottle!” Customers are also permitted to check out non-pharmacy items at the pharmacy counter, which I believe should be outlawed. Not only does it waste time, it sets a bad precedent by leading customers to equate pharmacy staff with register attendants, further diminishing the customer’s respect for them.

&amp;nbsp;

On behalf of everyone out there I’d like to say that I APPRECIATE YOU. 
I appreciate that you applied a coupon to my expensive Rx without me even knowing one existed, I appreciate your repeated calls to my doctor’s office to check the status of my PA, and I appreciate you offering sound counsel whenever I need it. In return, I promise to do my best to educate others on this subject in whatever way I can. I encourage you to band together and demand change for your entire industry. I am happy to stand beside you in the fight should I be useful.

1. I hear it commonly associated with rads, but it can also be applied to other fields like derm. What specialties have the best prospects of telemedicine?

2. What are ""telemedicine groups""? These idea seemed to be used in the context of entrepreneurial endeavors doctors may undertake.

3. Why is it stated in a negative light? Throughout forums, one of the cons people attribute to pursuing radiology residencies is the looming ""telemedicine."" Would this not be a positive thing, allowing for greater flexibility in the doctor's life?

4. Can telemedicine now, or in the future, be the bulk of a doctor's means of practice? Do any of the doctors here practice medicine this way?

5. Can telemedicine be used by doctors to achieve a digital nomad lifestyle, where they work abroad either for leisure or to take advantage of low cost of living while receiving the earning potential of US doctors.

pharmacy,I've got an ethical/moral question.,"I work for a small town independent pharmacy. We are closed on Sundays, open Saturdays from 8:30 AM to noon, and today for Christmas Eve opened at 8:30 AM and closed at noon, like a Saturday. I was lucky enough to be scheduled to work today's shift along with one tech and one clerk. 

&amp;#x200B;

We came in expecting it to be an easy day since it was Christmas Eve. We were wrong. It was crazy busy until I was finally able to lock the doors. Anyway, my question comes in from a patient that called about an hour before close and wanted their Combivent refilled. The patient asked to have it delivered, to which I replied that we could not as we do not do deliveries if the pharmacy isn't open for a full day (i.e. Saturdays and holidays). We didn't have the staff to do deliveries anyhow. I also mentioned that we were closing at noon, which judging by the patient's reaction was unknown to them. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a pause before the patient said that they were out of puffs in their current inhaler, were having trouble breathing, and that they didn't have anyone to come pick it up. They then proceeded to say that they'll likely have to go to the E.R. then because of this. I apologized before the patient said they would try to make it before close, but if not they made sure to let me know they'd be in the E.R. I apologized again, said I hope they make it, then hung up.

&amp;#x200B;

Ethically, is this the right thing to do? We were short staffed, thinking it was going to be a slow day. We don't normally do deliveries on days like these anyway, and then to top it off this particular patient seemed to want to guilt trip me for not delivering it today. Was what I did wrong? What would you do?",40,32,2018-12-24,PHARMA,0.09776068478822708,0.8707325458526611,0.03150675818324089
medicine,"Thoughts on new healthcare related apps like Roman, Hers, Keeps, YoDerm.","As the title suggests, just wondering what /r/medicine's opinion is on these new healthcare middlemen apps. A physician is still involved in the process currently but down the road I see this changing (reading into their start up story, they ran into problems with licensing for other prescribers being different from state to state and thus went with physicians to start). Currently it's very much a form of telemedicine except the middle man is taking a cut and providing the pharmacy services.

On one hand, primary care is already at a shortage so this sort of thing can lessen the burden on an already short staffed system. On the other hand, I see this cutting into PCP office income in the future (especially if they are able to transition to a cheaper alternative prescriber once they are established). In the short term, it might increase PCP income if they take part in the service (rumors suggest docs are being paid 400 an hour for these consults).

pharmacy,"Popular Opinion: I hate how pharmacists constantly live in fear of the DEA penalizing them for controlled prescription requirements, but the DEA refuses to clarify common situations. There is too much gray area with a lot of C-II requirements and it causes confusion to the point of paranoia [rant]","What are we allowed to change on a prescription? Nobody knows. Please don't link me that stupid powerpoint presentation from the DEA. It basically says anything can be changed except name and drug on a c-II...

What if its female and she got married? But she tells her pharmacy one name, tells her doctor another name, and the insurance company has her listed as a hyphonated name...

What if the doctor mispelled a name? Or they forgot the quanitity, or the directions didn't make sense or any of the other reasonable mistakes a human can make? ...btw if your a doctor and you still actually write prescriptions for a C-II (as opposed to printing something off a computer and signing it), how technologically retarded are you? Dr. Methuselah, I presume?

Some states actually clarify what we can change. If you live in such a state, you are a lucky one! Mine does not.

There are so many retarded rules with C-II's and everyone has their own idea of what is important or not. I fucking hate it. The big source of debate in my state is Physician assistants writing for more than a 72 our supply of a C-II. They can only do that if its for ongoing therapy....but will they write that on the script? Probably not...so I have to explain to mrs Johnson that she has to make that hour long drive to go get a new script...also define ""ongoing therapy?"" Whatever. I can't go down that rabbit's hole, I have a lot more to bitch about.

What if the Dr. writes ""oxycodone capsules"" but the directions say ""take one tablet by mouth""?

What if a mid level practitioner from a neighboring state writes for a quanitity that is not lawful in the state of the pharmacy?

In my state, a Physican assistant has to have the supervising physican and LICENSE NUMBER listed on the script....when is the fucking license number relevant outside of that one law? Why? And, fun fact, no one else in my area even knows that's a law...so please tell me why having the simple words ""for ongoing therapy"" is such a big deal, but no one even knows having a supervising physician listed is a requirement? How are we supposed to tell which laws are enforced and which arent?

Here's a good one: You can fax a prescription for a C-II for a NARCOTIC for a patient in hospice care.....so who wants to have another debate over the definition of narcotic? Why? Did I get a faxed prescription for a dying (not relevant to the rant, but now dead :( ) man for adderall? Yep. Is that legal? I still don't fucking know.

&amp;#x200B;

tbh...i think its all bs....i think no one really cares...I think pharmacists apparently were bored and took it upon themselves to find more things to worry about - trying to be a policeman too, I guess, and that mentality has infected our profession. ...but I like my job and my salary and best believe I'm not going to be the one to overlook a missing DEA number on a C-II prescription if every other pharmacist would deny it...

&amp;#x200B;

Also, giving and recieving a transfer over the phone (I'm talking about non controls now) for a new patient, from a previously unreached pharmacy, written by an out of town doctor, is cumbersome and long and annoying as fuck. Fucking fax that shit, idiot. It's 2018. I'm young. I don't like talking on the fucking phone and trying to discern an S from an F phoenetically...especially if the language we're using (english for me) isn't exactly your strong suit. Some pharmacy systems can't do the ""click of a button fax"" and that's basically the only excuse I can think of for giving it over the phone. Even if its a C-3-5, I'll still fax the hard copy to the pharmacy because THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU TRANSMIT INFORMATION ACCURATELY.

medicine,Resident teaching at night,"Hey guys!

I’m a nocturnist working at a university affiliated community teaching hospital. I love my job - I get to admit many high acuity patients, run codes, but what I love most about it is the opportunity to teach residents. I try to discuss interesting points about each patient that comes in and with debriefing sessions after codes - but I feel like I’m very inconsistent about it due to a lack of structure.

I’m posting because I’d like to hear any ideas that would help establish structure to teaching at night from a medical student/resident perspective. I’m not a big fan of long, structured didactic sessions because they get boring and I’m sure that’s not what residents want during a stretch of night shifts (I wouldn’t). I’d like to have residents walk away having learned a few things after each rotation, but without the burden of having to sit through bloated sessions.

Scene: hospital pharmacy, 7 floors of Pyxis fill.

I spent all morning without a quirk. Everything was running smooth. 1st shift tech was running late for lunch, but no biggie, it happens all the time. I went to mine a lil late which pushed back my deliveries by 10min maybe? Nothing I can't make up for. But then all hell broke loose. I left the 6th floor tote in the pharmacy. While i was on the 7th floor (I work top to bottom), he messaged me to let me know. No one could run it up, so I was gonna have to go get it. While I was filling the 7th floor Pyxis, I realized the distributor labeled a 4th floor tote as 7th floor, and also filled it halfway with 7th floor drugs. Then after I'm finally regrouped and ready to get back in my groove, I get nurse after nurse asking me if they can get into the Pyxis ""real quick"" which in reality probably was quick, but it seemed like every nurse and their dog was asking me to pause for them. And lastly, I might as well have all thumbs. Doesn't matter how squarely I touch a key, it seems like something screws up, or isn't recognized as a button press the 1st time.

pharmacy,Clonidine for 'sensory processing disorder' in very young children,"Working in poison control, children getting into clonidine is not uncommon. It's sometimes around grandma's house or an older sibling has a Rx for ADHD. Usually the kid is drowsy for several hours or some bradycardia develops, but I've fortunately not had to deal with too many cases requiring intubation and thankfully no fatalities.

However, I've noticed over the years that I've had more than a few cases where children as young as 2 1/2 are receiving therapeutic errors for *their* clonidine; usually things like double or triple doses or issues with dosing frequency. Unfortunately, a lot of the formulations seem to be compounded liquids, so there's the potential for very serious errors (see edit).  

When I inquire as to how in the world a 2 year old is prescribed clonidine, it's allegedly for something called 'sensory processing disorder' and the prescriber is an nondescript 'specialist'

I've tried to do my research, but it seems to very quickly go down a rabbit hole of mommy blogs and advocacy groups, while the actual scientific literature seems modest. Just curious if anyone else has run into this or if anyone working with pediatric psychiatry has any input.

medicine,I'm about to graduate from NP school and I am utterly unprepared.,"Exactly as the title says, I am enrolled at a top 10 brick and mortar nursing school to become an Adult/Gerontology acute care nurse practitioner. I have been a registered nurse in the CTICU and ED for 7 years prior to pursuing my NP. I purposefully applied to a top-10 brick and mortar program since I didn't want to go to a diploma mill online program that everyone I know is doing (The barrier to entry for NP these days is non-existent. There are hundreds of online NP programs across the country that just require your e-mail and an application fee.)  and wanted the best possible education I could get. After a year and a half in the program, I feel completely and utterly unprepared. NP education and clinical time is not adequate to generate competent clinicians. While we do have lectures from leaders in various fields, there is a huge focus on writing research papers, alternative treatments, and nursing theory. I was originally going to apply to PA school, but my NP program is heavily discounted since I work at the academic hospital linked to my university.

Even more frustrating are my classmates and others I interact with who are pushing for complete autonomy for nurse practitioners, and the cringeworthy ""heart of a nurse, brain of a doctor"" BS. The facts are clear, if you want to independently practice as a physician, go to medical school and become a physician. I came to NP school to gain a broader understanding of the pathophysiology underlying the disease and be able to adequately treat patients, but I am not there or even close. Furthermore, clinical hour requirements are less than PA's who are educated in the medical model, and oftentimes, I am embarrassed by my lack of knowledge when compared with the residents that I round with. I want to be competent, and not endanger my patients.In my free time, I try to study outside of my schoolwork as much as possible. I look up everything I don't know and have been using additional resources such as onlinemeded, uptodate, and step up 2 medicine for IM.
