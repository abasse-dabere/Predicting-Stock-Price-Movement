Up until now I have had no doubts in my mind that I love surgery and want to be the best surgeon I can be. I think this tail end of M4 is tough because I am not in that environment anymore. I'm basically spending my days at the river or the mountains with my classmates drinking and having fun with them...our conversations have got me seconding myself because, to be honest, I am kind of having buyer's remorse as I stare down the barrel of intern year. Up until now I was always so willing to work hard and get the job done but as I see my classmates talk about working 5 days a week and having relatively cush lifestyles after residency and even during, I'm starting to wonder if I made a mistake or was immature in not fully considering the lifestyle part of the equation. 


This brings me to my next question-- I know salaries vary a lot, but, what are the salaries in GS, plastics, CT, vascular and Surg Onc? Even anecdotal numbers would be fine because no one I talked to in medical school would really answer this question in an honest way.

medicine,What does a Primary Care Physician in the US do?,"Not intending to insult anyone - I am genuinely curious. I am a GP in Australia, which I think is the same as an American PCP but it seems we have very different caseloads.

For example - it seems US women go straight to the gynae for a pap smear and well women's check, for any female reproductive problems or contraception and as soon as they are pregnant. 
People go straight to the dermatologist with rashes or suspicious moles. 
Paediatricians see kids for vaccinations, healthy kid checks and any common childhood illness. 
Diabetes and thyroid discorders are managed by endocrinologists
etc etc etc
I do all of these things and refer along to other specialties only in complicated cases or cases that require surgical treatment for example. Most pregnancies are managed in a shared care arrangement including myself, my clinic midwife, the hospital midwives and Obstetrician.

So please satisfy my curiosity and tell me what the caseload of an average PCP in the US involves. Also do you think it deskills the other specialties?

A friend received a hand written script for lamical (lamotrigine). The script was written in cursive and quite illegible. The pharmacist filled for losartan since they look alike and have the same dosage forms( a tech typed it up and though thats what it was). The patient was new and had no fill history. The pharmacist was a new grad also. The patient ended up passing away after a seizure while operating a motor vehicle. 

this is not correct. People live are at risk so please take you time writing out a prescription or just e scribe. It takes just an extra second to potentially save someones life. 

For the record i did look at the scanned hard copy and it could have looked like either medication depending on how it was looked at. I know the pharmacist should have called and verified but if i had to call on every questionable script written it would take me all day. 
So please take your time writing these out. It our license on the line to decipher your handwriting and now a new grads life is over because of this issue over a poorly written prescription.",98,160,2017-05-07,PHARMA,0.09344232082366943,0.8819335699081421,0.024624183773994446

medicine,Non-medical person trying to understand and help surgical pathologist SO find a job.,"I'm not a medical person.  I work in general high tech as a computer engineer.  My girlfriend finished residency and then a single fellowship about 2 years ago (I think the fellowship was in surgical pathology?), and managed to find a surgical pathology job in the midwest.

So she's been working about 2 years now in a real job making real money finally.  I'm not sure how much, but I guess it's somewhere like $140-180K.  Problem is it's long distance currently between us and the city she ended up in is not very desirable.  She had to take the first thing she got as from what she's told me and from what I've researched, pathologist jobs right now are scarce with older folks not going into retirement.  Maybe it'll get better in the future.

The long distance relationship is a strain, and I can't easily move myself as my field is also constrained geographically.  I'm hoping she can move close to the west coast ""somewhere"" as the distance would be shorter, it'd be cheaper to see each other, and there'd be more interesting things to do in terms of activities and culture closer to the west coast.

How can I research for her, or find out any openings on her behalf?  I'm not talking about sending her resume out or anything, just the ability to notice any openings.  Where would I look?  How can I help along with the searching?  

I haven't asked her these things yet, because I don't want to put any more pressure on her to move than there already is, and make her feel bad for me having to search.  She's contemplating doing another fellowship, but i don't think she really wants to as it'd be another year of not making any real money.  My understanding though is she probably doesn't really ""need"" it, but it just looks good for practices to have paths on hand with multiple fellowships.",16,31,2017-05-07,PHARMA,0.029109761118888855,0.9182043075561523,0.052685901522636414

medicine,The Wealthy Patient Dilemma,"One of the facilities I trained at caters to the elites of this world. Some of them are celebrities, some of them billionaires. What I have noticed about this patient population is the ""care"" can be VERY wrong to the point where sometimes I have pity for them. I know it seems hard to believe but let me explain.

1) Polypharmacy:
The high end, big donor patient has trouble sleeping... Here's a sleeping pill. They have anxiety... Here's Xanax. They have pain... Here's Vicodin. The threshold for being aggressive about symptoms is very low because if that important person feels like they aren't getting service, they go somewhere else. That's why I see so many young, well to do people with long lists of meds and along with that diagnoses like fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndrome to justify them and higher opiate and benzo tolerance.

2) Overly Aggressive Care:
The combination of wanting to show off expensive toys to your wealthy patients, look more prestigious, bill them generously and reduce liability by overscreening in a population with big pockets for lawyers leads to a lot of questionable behavior.  I've seen knee jerk bronchoscopies for bronchitis, laryngoscopy for a sore throat, coronary CT scans for young people with no risk factors and mild costochondritis, annual whole body CT scans and the finding of the inevitable incidentalomas that then require follow-up biopsy which then have their own host of complications.  If a doctor wants to cover their butt on a high end client, they will order a ton of labs and inevitably some come back false positive and the doctor freaks out about a borderline ANA and gives steroids or borderline elevated TSH in a patient who has fatigue and prescribes Synthroid. If the patient has a small nodule on CT and the guidelines say follow-up imaging in 6 months, the doctor calls up his CT surgeon friend to proceed directly to VATs. The doctor says to their patient ""don't worry. I got this. We'll use a fiberoptic camera, small incisions and you'll be cured before it has a chance of becoming something serious."" The doctor then becomes the hero.

3) No Deescalation of Care:
It goes without saying that if your high end client is on a treatment or given a diagnosis, you will be very reluctant to stop or reclassify a diagnosis as a misdiagnosis. More sad and much more devastating to see is the reluctance for deescalation from the ICU; so many prolonged admits in patients with end stage diagnoses and I was forbidden from consulting Palliative Care. Their high end MDs treated giving a bad prognosis to a high end patient and their family like giving bad news to Saddam Hussein. At the same time, these doctors overexaggerated the seriousness of conditions, the challenges of management, to look amazing when things turned around for the good.

4) Can't Say No:
When the doctor of a celebrity is being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to be their private doc and that celebrity says ""I have the worst insomnia and the last time I think I slept well was after that cosmetic surgery when they gave me propofol. Why don't we just use that?"" ""Uh... sure Michael, I'll place an IV and I guess I'll monitor it myself. No problem."" The wealthy like to Google things and then demand that and the doctor doesn't want to say no. People forget that Steve Jobs had the fortunately CURABLE form of pancreatic cancer but decided there was a holistic herbal regimen he wanted to try instead of chemo and though I can't say his Oncologist didn't try to say ""no, that's a bad idea,"" but I'm just saying I've seen how hard it is for doctors to say no to their high end clients and fall out of their favor.

5) All Roads Lead to Doctor:
If you have pain, soreness, I have the remedy in the form of a pill. You don't need to suck it up.  If you're overweight, I'll get the lap band for you and you won't need to diet.  We don't need to figure out why you're tired all the time. Won't screen for depression. Take some growth hormone and testosterone and you'll feel great. Instead of the patient being self reliant, the doctor slowly creates a situation where their wealthy client DEPENDS on them to solve their problems. It's like when a wealthy patient says ""I have the greatest doctor! He is the absolute greatest"" I'm always thinking in the back of my head ""is that because he completely suckered you into his facade of being the high end, beautiful officed, Armani suite wearing guy who solves all your problems for you?""

Why am I talking about this? Maybe you don't feel sorry for the massive list of celebrities and wealthy people who die of prescription overdoses, and ridiculous care... well maybe we should because as medical professionals we need to have sympathy for ALL PEOPLE.  But, more to the point, the ideas here probably resonate with all doctors practicing in all demographics in the US.  It is what we see in ourselves that we hate the most but amplified as the stakes go up. It's what we hate the most about operating in a high liability environment, overly defensive medicine and the perils of for profit care that caters to money and sacrifices our medical training to the false god of prestige.  The problem is never the fresh eyed, new medical graduate full of idealism who then understands in the first years of medicine the major limitations of the job of being a physician, what can realistically be medically achieved, but the physician who then becomes cynical and uses his/her position to cultivate an unrealistic persona to charm clients, to endear themselves to them and depend on them, the doctor who makes a living selling themselves rather than their quality of medical care.  It is a major dilemma of our profession and one that is amplified in the highest reaches of money and power.",136,497,2017-05-10,PHARMA,0.06599088944494724,0.8995736837387085,0.03443544264882803

pharmacy,I'm a new tech at CVS. How do I transition to a hospital setting?,"Context:

- I'm licensed but not yet certified. I was told that I should wait a year to take the PTCB (in my state, you have 2 years to pass it) but hospitals want certifications and IV prep knowledge (I think that is continued ed that I would need to add to my certification?)

- I've been there about a month and a half. I was told that I'd be making 9.40 an hour (less than I made when I was a teenager) until training was over, but am realising that training will take half a year (they told me 2 weeks when I accepted the offer) and then I'll only get a dollar raise. I was told by a co-worker that after 9 months, they still don't let her work in drop off. I'm not sure why they do this but I'm getting frustrated because so far things have not been difficult and I just want to learn how to be a tech. I am restless but I thought I'd manage until i learned that I have to get a new car and I'm panicking about my finances.

pharmacy,Questilions From A Prepper/Author,"I'm writing a short story about the aftermath of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) where there will be almost no electronics functioning.  I'm trying to be as factual as possible so I have a few questions!

Question One: Approximately how much insulin is going to be in a small town (population 2000) the day they're set to get a delivery? Are they down to a few boxes? For example would the sentence, ""April counted 30 assorted vials and 12 boxes of insulin pens on the refrigerator shelves and worried how long they'd last in the July heat with no way to keep them cool."" be super low balling or is it typical to drop in stocks the day of delivery?
Question Two: How many brands of insulin are in the normal fridge? I know of Lantus, novalog, Humulin, etc and they they come in both pen and syringe but are there many more types typically filled each week? In my story it's a small community and since 3% of USA has insulin using diabetes, approx 60 ppl will have  been getting prescriptions in this pharmacy of 2000 people community. If  prescription normally lasts a month and there's 60 total, would ordering day most likely only have a couple of types and a couple boxes/vials left or does a pharmacy try to stay ahead of the curve and have several of each etc. 
Question Three: how many types of antibiotics  would normally be on shelves and how many total prescriptions on the last day before a shipment to this drug store?
Question Four: same question but for pain meds. 
Question Five: would you assume a lock down in place for pharmacy staff if a nuke went off 100 miles away or locking up and going home? 
Question six:  do you have a protocol for an EMP or nuclear attack on USA whereby all communications are decimated?

medicine,How much do you trust lab results?,"As I procrastinate on studying for my blood bank final, a question occurred to me that I've wanted to ask for a while.

For doctors who work in hospitals, to what extent do you generally assume that tests have been drawn correctly? By that I mean, as an example we get lipid panel orders all the time. Nobody except for me ever asks when the last time the patient ate was, and I've watched coworkers draw them while the patient is munching on a bag of chips. Everyone keeps tourniquets on (very tightly) as long as they feel like they need to in order to find a vein and get blood, whether that's 30 seconds or 10 minutes, even if the test is a lactic acid. That AM cortisol level you ordered probably got drawn at 0430, not 0800 like it should have been. One of my coworkers who has been there for like 5 years didn't know that ammonia samples have to be chilled and immediately sent to the lab. Etc.

Do you just get used to lab values that tend to occur at your institution (like maybe lactic acid levels tend high, because of the tourniquet thing) and adjust your mental reference ranges accordingly? Obviously, big errors or drastic changes in results usually get noticed by someone, but the sneakier things like that cortisol level that was drawn too early seem harder to spot.

Are you even able to check that kind of thing, and if so, do you?

I am aware that there is a wide difference between what is taught in class as being the Right Way To Do Things, and what actually matters in practical application, and I also know that generally speaking the mantra is 'treat the patient, not the labs', but some of these seem like they could alter someone's treatment plans significantly.",38,56,2017-05-13,PHARMA,0.04435126855969429,0.925478994846344,0.03016972541809082

medicine,my patient completed suicide,"This is the first post I've ever made here, apologies for any errors.  I am a pgy1 in psychiatry, and I just need some advice.  

A few weeks ago, I had a young patient who had been on the inpatient unit for about 2 weeks.  He was here for depression and suicidal thoughts.  He ended up staying on the unit and as far as I could tell he got so much better.  Like, better than I suppose I should have expected in just 2 weeks.   But he did get better it seemed.  His affect was so bright and infectious, he said all the right things, he went to every group on the unit, he took his medication and he was never a problem on the unit.  I was never worried about him.  I don't think anyone did.

And that's what makes all of this so hard for me.  Yesterday he returned to the hospital.  He never made it back to us because he died of a medication overdose in the micu, on the medication I sent him home with.  A medication he wouldn't have if not for me.

  If I didn't notice with him, how am I going to notice with the next patient, with any of my patients?  What the hell am I even doing?

Before you tell me to talk to my attending, I tried.  Everyone has shut down as this is now a medicolegal issue.  I don't even care about the legal part of it, whatever happens I deserve it. I don't have anyone I can really talk to, as I moved across the country about a year ago to be a part of my program, and my spouse is not at all involved in the medical system.

medicine,As an MD I discovered first hand how frustrating it is not to be believed by your doctor,"I can actually understand how people can go to five different specialists out of desperation.

For about two years I've been suffering from myalgia, anxiety, thirst, memory loss, confusion, dizziness and insomnia. This year I really struggled to stay awake during the day and when I started forgetting to feed my dogs, I decided it was time for a blood panel. There is was: hypercalcemia and a high PTH. I sent myself for a sestamibi scan and my colleague found two localized points.

After that I asked my ENT friend to see me and he said sure. He said he'd like me to go see his general surgery friend to confirm the diagnosis. The surgeon was a pleasant guy but he told me that he wasn't prepared to operate this. He did an ultrasound on me in his rooms and said he saw nothing. He also said my vitamin D was low and that was the cause. He then said he's turned down two patients in the same week with the same problem and that I must come back in 6 months. He said the nuclear scan is too vague and there's no good localization. 

Frustrated, I went back to my friend who then decided to side with the surgeon... saying that we should wait to see if it 'matures'. I understood that they didn't want to operate and find nothing, but I knew it was there. I had symptoms. I had hypercalcemia. He outright told me maybe I'm working too hard and it's depression.

I then went off to my other friend, a general surgeon who decided he would operate me. He repeated the blood tests and found them to be markedly elevated. I had an outpatient parathyroid exploration the next day and they removed a 1g adenoma from the right inferior pole behind the thyroid gland. Three weeks later and I'm a new man. I can remember things, and I no longer need to force myself to stay awake from midday. It's like a thick cloud has lifted from me.

I understand the first surgeon was wrong about a few things, but I have since learned that many of his answers are common opinions among specialists (like blaming Vit D for a high PTH, even though a high calcium will never be found in these cases). It's easy to tell someone to come back in 6 months for a re-check, but it's not you that is suffering from crippling insomnia and pseudodementia. I can't imagine what it must be like to be a lay person and to feel completely helpless in this situation - I was at least enabled in a way and could partially steer my treatment.

TL DR: No one believed me that I had a parathyroid adenoma.",208,911,2017-05-19,PHARMA,0.12744474411010742,0.8452233672142029,0.027331868186593056

medicine,American Academy of PAs vote to start push for independent practice without physician supervision and their own state oversight boards,"The American Academy of PAs have officially voted to start a nation-wide push for independent practice rights. The way I interpreted it was essentially the right to practice medicine with full independence in any specialty just like any residency/fellowship-trained, board-certified physician. That is my interpretation, but I will give you the exact text of their resolution. They are calling for ""Optimal Team Practice."" What does that mean?: 
  
&gt; Optimal Team Practice reemphasizes the PA profession’s commitment to team-based care, and in an amendment offered on the floor of the House of Delegates, **reaffirms that the degree of collaboration between PAs and physicians should be determined at the practice level. It also supports the removal of state laws and regulations that require a PA to have and/or report a supervisory, collaborating or other specific relationship with a physician in order to practice. In addition, the new policy advocates for the establishment of autonomous state boards with a majority of PAs as voting members to license, regulate and discipline PAs, or for PAs to be full voting members of medical boards. Finally, the policy says that that PAs should be eligible to be reimbursed directly by public and private insurance for the care they provide.**

medicine,This is my last day of medical school. I wish I had never matriculated.,"Today is my last day of medical school. I wish I could be happy but instead I am full of regret.

I have been miserable for the past four years--cramming, exhausting myself emotionally and physically, running around the hospital after my attendings, trying desperately to reduce my patients' suffering. Despite the fact that I had no psychiatric history prior to medical school, I have developed major depressive disorder. I was hospitalized twice for suicidal ideation. I am $253,000 in debt.

I thought I wanted to be a physician, but that was before I knew what being a physician really meant. I thought I was going to be investigating disease, holding patients' hands, helping people figure out how to live happy and healthy lives. It turns out there's lots of bureaucracy and paperwork and looking after the bottom line and putting band-aids over gaping wounds. We follow patients' electrolyte levels obsessively, but we're afraid to address their humanity. We ignore the social determinants of health. If you talk about suffering, you're told to buck up and remember your roots as a scientist. A lot of the problems we see are the result of societal failings--poverty, poor air quality, lack of support for people with addiction and mental illness.

I don't want to work for a healthcare system that exploits vulnerable people in order to pad the salaries of insurance company CEOs, to fund lobbyists for Big Pharma. I don't want their dirty money.

I've been accepted into a well-respected residency program in my chosen specialty. I guess I'm going to go through with it. But I wish, desperately, that I could go back and make a different choice.

I don't think that it would help me to hear things like ""it serves you right for going into medicine"" because I thought I had vetted the career before I entered--tons of shadowing, speaking at length with different types of medical providers, etc. But if anyone has had a similar experience, or has something to say that might allow me to feel less regret, I'd be grateful to hear it.

medicine,"Prophylactic HPV vaccine in boys reduces high risk infections by almost 90%. Yet the vaccine's low utilization hinders population level impact, particularly in men.","ASCO abstracts were released earlier this week. One study that particularly jumped out to me as particularly important was the work assessing the impact of prophylactic HPV vaccination on oral HPV infections among young adults in the U.S. I will be interested to see the presentation, but my intuition is that these results will put a lot of pressure on payers to start covering this vaccine for young boys.

Abstract:
&gt; Background: The incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers has risen in recent decades among US men. The potential impact of HPV vaccines on oral HPV infections has yet to be evaluated in efficacy-trials or surveillance studies. Methods: To evaluate the impact of prophylactic HPV vaccination on oral HPV infections in the US population, we conducted a cross-sectional study among men and women aged 18-33 years (n = 2,627) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011-2014. We examined the effect of self-reported receipt of ≥1 vaccine dose on oral HPV infection (vaccine-types 16/18/6/11) prevalence among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals. Additional outcomes included percent reduction in infection-prevalence among vaccinated individuals and population-level effectiveness of vaccination. Analyses accounted for the complex sampling design. Comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were conducted using binary logistic regression, with adjustment for age, gender, and race. Statistical significance was assessed using a quasi-score test. Results: During 2011-2014, 18.3% of the US population aged 18-33 years reported receipt of ≥1 HPV vaccine-dose prior to age 26 (29.2% in women and 6.9% in men; P&lt; 0.001). The prevalence (population-weighted) of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was significantly reduced in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals (0.11% vs. 1.61%; P= 0.008), corresponding to an estimated 88.2% (95%CI = 5.7%-98.5%) reduction in prevalence. Notably, oral HPV16/18/6/11 prevalence was significantly reduced in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated men (0.0% vs. 2.13%; P= 0.007). In contrast, prevalence for 33 non-vaccine HPV types was similar (3.98% vs. 4.74%; P= 0.24). Accounting for HPV vaccine-uptake, the population-level effectiveness of HPV vaccination on the burden of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was 17.0% overall, 25.0% in women and 6.9% in men. Conclusions: HPV vaccination substantially reduced vaccine-type oral HPV infection prevalence among young adults (ages 18-33 years) in the US population during 2011-2014. However, due to low vaccine uptake, population-level effectiveness was modest overall and particularly low in men.

pharmacy,Compounding Pharmacies Still Selling Buprenorphine Troches?,"I'm a previous pharmacy technician (and admitted addict...which is why I don't work in this field any longer).  I recently happened to stumble across an old friend who is under the care of a Suboxone doctor and this person some how gets his buprenorphine compounded from the only compounding pharmacy I know of in the area.  I kindly asked to see his pack, and lo and behold it said ""Buprenorphine 6mg/Naloxone 1.5mg/Clonidine 0.05mg"" and they were genuine troches.  I know that several years ago compounding pharmacies used to try and skirt the price hike of Suboxone/Subutex by just compounding it into troches but the DEA put an end to that and forced compounding pharmacies to stop producing buprenorphine troches...I'm just wondering how they're able to fill this type of prescription and actually get away with it.  The friend told me that the Clonidine in each troche was for his BP as well as hidradenitis suppurativa but I'm thinking that they must have concocted some sort of scheme to circumvent the laws of making Suboxone troches and save some money since his cost is probably less than a third of what Walgreens or CVS would want for the same amount of Subutex/Suboxone(generic) or even Zubsolv/Bunavail.  I too am on Suboxone for the record, but as a previous pharmacy technician I had to ask if this is even legal, and if so is it the clonidine in it that makes the troches legal?  Any input is welcome here...thanks for your time.",15,20,2017-05-21,PHARMA,0.08485877513885498,0.8834576606750488,0.03168356046080589

medicine,Tips for a successful intern year!,"A new year is about to start so I thought as a PGY-2 I could help.

1- Be in the hospital at least one hour prior to the morning report.

2- Check out V/S for patients over the last 24 hours and any new labs or events overnight from the computer.

3- Pre-round on patients physically, ask about the subjective complaints (Improved vs worseneded), new complaints? Focused physical exam (Crackles improved in HF patient?).

4- Go back to the computer or write on a paper your assessment of the situation. Is the patient improving? Stable? Deteriorating?

5- Write your plan. Discharge? Upgrade the antibiotics? Stop a medication? Order a new test? Perform a procedure?

6- Attend the morning report. Have a notebook and write some of the infos being said. Read about it later.

7- Round with the attending and present your case like:
(Name) Mr. Flan is a (Age) 70 year old (Sex) man who is know to have (Chronic conditions) DM, HTN and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the hospital with (Cheif complaint) chest pain and found to have (Diagnosis) acue STEMI. He underwent (Procedure or treatment) immediate revascularization by angiography with drug eluting stent to RCA and currently on Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Ramipril, Bisoprolol and Atorvastin.
He is (Subjective) pain free now and mobilize well with no dyspnea or fatigue. He is vitally stable HR 60, BP 110/70. No complaints over night. Latest ECG is normal sinus rythm. My assessment he's stable and we can discharge him with outpatient appointment.

8- Never argue. If the attending wants to keep the patient, to discharge him, to do whatever he wants just say yes and do it.

9- Don't give a different opinion from the attending unless he asks for your opinion.

10- Sit with the nurse and inform her of the teams plan. Ask if she/he agrees and for any suggestions.

11- Perform the plan and write your notes.

12- Always be nice to the nurses, don't argue alot, don't shout, don't be condescending. If bleeped call immediately and never get angry even for stupid calls. It's your job!

13- Read, chill and follow the excution of your plan throughout the day.

14- Sign out and endorse your patients carefully.

15- Never be in a hurry to leave the hospital. You'll when you're done.

16- MKSAP is your friend. Do at least 5-10 questions a day and you'll finish it in no time. It's the most related question bank to your career you'll ever do.

17- Your senior is your boss not your colleague.

18- Always be nice to everyone.

19- Don't talk to patients about stuff you don't know or about a specialist plan unless you're sure.

20- Keep fit, eat healthy, and get enough sleep.",117,202,2017-05-22,PHARMA,0.10358060151338577,0.8651610016822815,0.03125840798020363

Nuclear - A pharmacist who enjoys chemistry, like a lot, someone who enjoys challenges, doesn't really enjoy people interaction, and  is probably kind of straightforward.

For those less familiar with the law, this does NOT give prescription authority to pharmacists; rather, it allows a pharmacist to bill for their own services instead of billing ""incident-to"" a physician.  This will drastically effect retail entities as they cannot bill incident-to since their is no prescriber on-site.

medicine,r/medicine is not a welcoming sub for foreign physicians,"Here in Mexico ever since I started studying medicine in 2001 we have been warned against using abbreviations in our notes and the medical charts that we use everyday. This is simply because things can get lost in translation due to the fact that there is no standardization on this matter, and we have to make sure that the next person who's going to see a medical chart or a patient's medical history can fully understand what we are trying to say inside said chart for obvious reasons. 

So that is my issue with this sub. Everytime I find an interesting case or article, I just don't feel any confidence in writing a comment response because I maybe not getting the full picture of what you're trying to say. 

Abbreviations can sometimes be so random and particular even between different medical fields. I should add i consider I have very good english reading comprehension and the same for speaking it a little less optimal comprehension for hearing it.

I know it's going to be very difficult for you to change your writing habits, maybe even the way you speak everyday at your workplace or practice, but I just want you to think about this the next time you write a comment or post something, so maybe little by little this sub can change the way it addresses in the comment section to any particular case or article that is going to be discussed.

medicine,Relationship in residency,"I'm in the process of deciding whether or not to follow my SO to a new city as he embarks on a 5 year residency in sub specialty surgery. We have been dating for 6 months while he's been a second semester 4th year med student, so I have no clue how stressed he can get and how well we would deal with it.  I have a job offer lined up in his new city already which happens to be a great career move for me and he is ecstatic about the possibility of moving in together. So it comes down to taking a leap of faith perhaps before I'm 100% ready, or pass on a great career opportunity so I can take a little more time to figure out if I could be happy with him in a new city where neither of us know anyone.

So here are my questions to you fine people to help me make my decision:  What's the worst to expect from residency? What are the best of times?

In short, Vertex pulled access to their multi-million-dollar limited distribution drugs from CVS Specialty, reportedly due to ""unhappiness with the larger specialty pharmacies service levels""

Key quote from the article is ""A source who asked not to be named tells SPN that there is “growing frustration with the service levels” specialty pharmacies — particularly larger ones — are providing. He says that at the recent Asembia conference, he spoke with almost 20 large manufacturers that expressed that opinion but weren’t sure what they could do about it.""

I know there is a pretty big rift between those who believe specialty pharmacy is valuable as a service and those who think ""I'm a pharmacist just as much as the other guy, this is bullshit"" but both sides generally agree that Specialty Pharmacy as advertised by the PBMs a a crock of shit that doesn't actually mean they're managing care, it means that they're hoarding profitable drugs because they don't want to pay out to another pharmacy - and then they tout ""adherence"" in the form of shipping a dozen extra refills to the patient that they don't need.

pharmacy,Ever made a complaint on a doctor?,"Long time lurker, now reaching out for a little assistance.
I'm a pharmacist of a stagnant suburb, with doctors I wouldn't choose to be my own or my family's. One in particular I have had multiple issues with: atrocious handwriting, poor interactions when I call for clarifications, and negligence with prescribing, particularly with antibiotics. 

A patient of mine was given Cipro and Amoxicillin for diverticulitis. The prescriptions were written for 30 day supplies with 6 refills, so *seven months' worth* of antibiotics, and incorrect antibiotic selection - AFAIK, Amoxil doesn't even phase gut bacteria, at least for diverticulitis, and Cipro and Flagyl are almost the exclusive go-to, other than Augmentin monotherapy.

The patient came back a few days later with scripts from the hospital for Cipro + Flagyl, for appropriate lengths of therapy. I've always had troubles with the first prescriber, and now I feel like the prescriber's negligence has put a patient in the hospital (or the ER at least).

I believe a local doctor's negligence has gone too far, and I should put a complaint in to the state's medical board. Has anyone ever done this? Did it start a conflict? Would the medical board pin it on me, on the basis of ""I touched it last"" upon dispensing the prescription? (FYI, pt was asked about the duration, and Med Guide for Cipro was included).
