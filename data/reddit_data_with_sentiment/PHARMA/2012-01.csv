Health,Iodine soaked gauze left on overnight.,"Well, happy new years.

Last night I cut my finger on something, and in my drunken stupidity, I soaked a gauze with Iodine and wrapped it around the finger. When I woke up I immediately removed it.

My finger is now deeply stained brown, almost black. The skin is very dry and has lost it's elasticity, so my cut is not going to heal. It's almost like a shell.

Health,"Does anyone else hear very faint music playing when they have their head on their pillow at night? As soon as I lift my head, I can't hear it anymore...","*tone: a little worried, a bit curious*

As the title says, I hear very faint music, or sometimes what sounds like talk radio (a little static-y and muffled), when I am lying in bed at night, my head on the pillow. Sometimes I also think I hear my phone's ringtone from the other room, again very faintly. A couple times I've been so convinced I heard it that I got up and checked my phone. Nope.

We sleep with fans on, both for noise and air circulation, and I've sometimes wondered if I'm just slightly hallucinating and hearing things in the fan's white noise.

My brother is a neurologist, and when I mentioned this to him, he shrugged it off and said he heard faint sounds at night, too, and he just chalked it up to stress.

I'm not totally sure that's what it is... I hear it every night, regardless of my mental state or tiredness level.

Does anyone else experience this? Does anyone know what causes it or what's going on? Should I be concerned? Thanks!

Health,"I spent an entire year eating completely within Daily Value %, some thoughts","I don't feel any healthier.  My bloodwork results, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc all stayed the same.  The only thing that changed is I got scrawnier.

I lost 10 lbs (5'11 male, 158 to 148).  This was the hardest part.  It is extremely difficult to get enough calories in a day while keeping unhealthy nutrients below 100% daily value.  The two real enemies are sat fats and sodium.  Really what it comes down to is anything tasty will get you to the 100% sodium limit before 1000 calories.  You need to consume over half your calories from extremely bland, bulky food such as rice, potatoes, grains, etc.  I don't think it's possible to gain weight eating only these, because there simply isn't enough room in your gut in a given day.

Anyways, it was interesting noticing just how few people actually care about %DV, and how impossible it is to maintain in America, even if eating ""healthy"".  Try walking through a grocery store and putting together 2000 calories while not busting DV% in sat fat or sodium, it's impossible (unless half of it consists of grains or plain bland carbs, but have you ever tried shoving down 1000 calories of rice per day, every day)?

Anyone else try this?  Interestingly enough it became more of a habitual lifestyle change for me so I'm pretty much sticking with it whether I want to or not, but I'm a little worried about continued weight loss...it's so hard to get enough healthy calories that will not make me want to kill myself from blandness after a few weeks.

edit: I should mention that I was not attempting to moderate calorie intake or lose weight, this was not my goal.  My goal was focused on healthy calorie ratios, i.e. how can I best consume 1000 calories at 50% DV of sodium/sat fat, 2000 calories at 100% DV, 2500 calories at 125% DV, etc.  I typically just ate whatever amount I felt like eating, although when your diet is extremely bland, it's very difficult to down 2,000 calories or more on a daily basis for months on end. This is where my weight loss came from.",67,84,2012-01-02,PHARMA,0.1456841379404068,0.8232202529907227,0.03109561651945114

Health,Strong allergies in newly rented apartment - dust mites? Tips on anti-allergy cleaning?,"Hiya,

My girlfriend and I just moved to a new flat... it has carpets, is kind of small with relatively poor ventilation (now in winter it's too cold to have the window open).

We're both suffering strong allergies - sneezing, coughing, tight chest, burning eyes, etc. Outwardly the furniture / carpet / couch / bed, etc. look clean, modern and in good condition. 

We suspect the carpet... dust mites? Something like that. Any advice beyond vacuuming towards anti-allergy cleaning? The symptoms are so strong that we'd even consider hiring a house/carpet cleaning crew, but if we can do the work ourselves with some good products it would be better. :]

I am currently an undergrad volunteering in my local ED (a level 1 trauma center). I have seen a few people pass in my time volunteering and when they pass I usually feel no emotional changes.

Should I be concerned that seeing someone die does not phase me?

medicine,"My brother-in-law is in jail, he has had a simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplant (in 2004), they refuse to give him his anti-rejection medications....","First, I am not sure why exactly he is in jail, but he is uninjured.  I cannot afford to post his bail, so I cannot get him out.  The corrections facility refused to give him the anti-rejection medications he is prescribed.  They claim the medications are too rare for them to have any stocked even though he brought his medications with him (we confirmed that they do have the medications he brought, but they will not give those to him).  They say that it will take 2 days or more for them to give them anything.  We cannot get any more information about the medication at this time, as to what they are exactly, but my concern is in relation to how much damage, if any, missing his doses for 2-3 days would cause.  We have tried to call his doctor, our doctors, and many other medical professionals, with the response that they are unable to give medical advice over the phone and they end the conversation there.  This is taking place in Florida if that matters.  Please help us reddit, we just need to know what we are dealing with in some capacity.

**update:** The nurse on duty at the facility told us that she agrees that it is ridiculous to put someone in such a situation, but followed with ""he committed a crime and it is ultimately his responsibility"".  Although off-topic, upon further research, the situation is a domestic dispute, in which the state is not charging him with anything, but instead a threat he made in anger, caused his live-in girlfriend to press charges against him.  What happen to innocent until proven guilty?  He can sit in jail for whatever he did or did not do, such is the legal system, but I cannot accept that he would have his life threatened by refusal to medicate for a situation like this.

**update:** I appreciate the advice. We must wait for an update on the situation at this point (they quoted an hour). We finally got through to his transplant coordinator, who told us that in his situation that it is imperative that he get his doses. She referred us to the Director of Nursing at the facility. We called the Director and informed them that they either need to take action and get him the medications he needs, or we are going to report the situation to local news and pursue legal action. Within 10 minutes, they called us back telling us that they sent someone to obtain the medications at an offsite pharmacy, so we are waiting the hour they told us it would take until doing anything else.

**update(1/10):**  He has been given his medications after hours of fighting.  At this point, I am just concerned that other people will deal with the same thing.  Should I still report this to the ACLU or something like that? Or by them giving the medications to him (eventually), do I not have any grounds to complain?  I appreciate the responses and I hope no one else has to deal with something like this. :/",12,27,2012-01-09,PHARMA,0.0742259994149208,0.8958677053451538,0.029906252399086952

I took my tampon out earlier, and [low and behold (WARNING: these are pictures of a used tampon)](http://imgur.com/a/QlUof#HFF6x), this thing was wrapped around it. The pictures, which I took both out of morbid fascination and for the purpose of further clarification, don't really do it justice at all. It was as the title describes--bulbous, thick looking (though I didn't touch it), really white (not off-white) with some blood wrapped around it, and enveloped half of the tampon and wrapped around the bottom. I've had cramps for the past week and a half or so and had awful, crippling cramps today, but the latter is typical of a normal period for me. 

My first instinct was that this was a miscarriage. I believe I've had one before--something came out of me similar to this, but more compact , fibrous and lengthy with bulbous parts, gray/brown/pink in parts, with what looked like a blue vein going down the length of it. That was about 2 years ago. However, because I've been stifling my period (at least I think so) for a little while, it could also just be a massive load of lining. 

Background for this thing: When I got home for break about a month ago, I started having my period only a week after having had my last period. My period can be pretty irregular, but that was odd. I was sexually active this past month and started the birth control pill just after the odd period started, hoping to stifle it. I'd been off the pill for several months. I've been spotting consistently for much of this past month--dark brown/black, sticky stuff. Old blood that'd been partially stifled by the bc, I figured. This past month, I had my partner ejaculate inside me several times. I've been weirdly nocturnal and the time I've been taking my pill has varied almost every day, but it was always within four hours, usually much less, of my preferred time (EDIT: before people get on my case about this, my doctor has told me to take the pill within four hours of the same time every day, and that'll be fine). I strongly supposed I wasn't ovulating at all during this time because of the birth control, my lack of raging lust, and the consistency of my vaginal mucous. However, I could be wrong. 

Does anyone have any advice about this? I know I should probably see a doctor, and I'll talk to my counselor at my school's health center when I get back in a few days. 

**TL:DR; That -ness came out of me and I've had a rather screwy month. I'm concerned that it may be a miscarriage or that something is dreadfully wrong with my insides.**",28,19,2012-01-12,PHARMA,0.09142673015594482,0.8828550577163696,0.02571818232536316

Health,"I stopped eating bread, pasta, and beans to lose weight, and I've never felt more AWAKE in my life. Has there been something wrong with me until now?","I'm a 40-year-old male about 10 kilos overweight, and though I've been jogging daily for the past six months, I haven't really seen any changes from it.

So reasoning that by cutting out high-calorie foods and switching to foods with lower calorie density, I could lose weight while still being well-nourished, I cut out all of the following:

Breads

Pasta

Beans

Rice 

Oatmeal

Potatoes

Cheeses

After only about a week, I've become incredibly energized, as if I've been sleepwalking through life until now. 

Now I wake up before my alarm without grogginess, I make it through the entire workday without needing to sneak off for a nap, when I go out on the weekends I have great energy all day long, and my daily jog has become a doddle. I find it hard to understate the dramatic nature of the change: I have literally never before in my life--even as a child--felt so present, awake and aware of my surroundings, focused, clear-headed, and energetic.

My new diet is mainly meats, lettuce, carrots, zucchini, cucumbers, yoghurt, onion, eggs, mushrooms, apples, oranges, pears, and bananas. I ate all of those things before, too; there has been a subtraction from my diet, but nothing new added.

Has there been something wrong with me? Could I be allergic to something in one or several of the foods I've cut out?  Could I have some kind of metabolic disorder triggered by those foods?

Health,I did the following 3 things and lost 35 pounds!,"I did the following 3 things and lost 35 pounds! Granted this did not happen overnight, but after just a few weeks, I noticed a huge difference in the way I felt and my energy level was higher too plus I stopped getting that daily mid afternoon [2 – 3pm] sluggish feeling.
 
ONE: Drink Water!
If you are currently in the habit of swigging down a sugary soft drink one or multiple times throughout the day, just not doing that will work wonders for your health, fat loss, and overall well-being.
 
According to Wikipedia, ""The consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, dental cavities, and low nutrient levels.""
 
Throughout the day drink several glasses of refreshing H2O goodness instead of guzzling down that calorie laden vessel of unhealthy sugary / high fructose corn syrup badness.
Water on the rocks! Be creative if you like and add some zing your water creations by topping them off with a wedge of lime or lemon. You can even submerge a slice of cucumber or whatever other vegetable or fruit wedge that you like. It’s surprising how easy and refreshing it is.
Soda pop has somewhere between 100 to 300+ calories per glass depending on the size you get. That’s way too many calories for something that for all practical purposes has no nutritional value.
Here’s a little background on my soda consumption. I used to drink tons of soda because I’ve worked at many places where it was free (Yaay, lucky me). By not drinking soda, I cut back on my calorie consumption by 300 – 1000 calories per day. Now that was way too many empty calories.
 
TWO: Walk!
Walking has got to be one of the best things a person can do for their health. Going for a walk (especially mid work day) reduces stress levels, clears the mind and acts like a mini-vacation. Exercise… hey walking is exercise and has been known to increase metabolism. Increased metabolism means that your body will burn more calories. Burning extra calories is good.
Decreasing stress levels helps the body operate more efficiently. Think about it, when the mind and body aren’t stressed, they can spend more energy on running more efficiently and healthy as opposed to reacting and trying to recover.
If you haven’t been walking very much and want to start, the easiest way to start is… and here’s the secret; just start walking. You don’t need to go very far or for too long a time at first. Literally begin by going out and walking 10 or even just 5 minutes per day. Walk for 3 to 5 days per week. 5 days would be better, but the most important thing to remember here is consistency. Every week add 5 minutes to your daily walk and after a few weeks, you will be walking 20 to 30 minutes per day!
Any time of day is good for walking. I usually get a good walk in at lunch or in the mid afternoon. Another thing that I do is take the stairs at work (up and down). The stairs give me a little extra walking boost. The way I figure it, every little bit is an extra bonus to my health.
If you need to get motivated, try walking with a friend when possible. That way, you can both chat along the way and get some good calorie burning in!
 
THREE: Don’t Pig Out! (Portion Control)
I know what you may be thinking; “But I’m really hungry man!” – trust me, I know the feeling well. The idea here is to eat fewer calories throughout the day. It’s not as complicated or difficult as it may sound.
 
Let’s say I’m at a Thai restaurant for lunch and sitting before me is a huge plate of fried rice or phad thai. I will typically separate it out into two halves and only eat one half. I then get the other half to go, and that becomes my lunch for the next day. See, I save calories and money at the same time!
In the “old days”, I would tend to totally pig out and eat the entire high carb, calorie laden mound of rice or noodles.This would result in the dreaded mid afternoon sluggish/can barely keep my eyes open condition due to the fact that I had a huge high carb, calorie laden mound of rice or noodles hibernating inside my stomach.
The key here is to eat less / more often. What in the world am I talking about? Well, it’s like this see… Instead of eating three big meals per day, split it up into 4 or 5 smaller meals. Your brain takes somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 minutes to tell your stomach it’s full; Funny how that works, isn’t it? So, eat a little slower and then after the 20 minutes or so, you shouldn’t  feel hungry any more. Of course everyone is different, but I think you get the idea. I almost forgot to mention something about those smaller meals; make sure the daily total calories is less than what you are currently eating. You don’t want to cut yourself off the calories too much right away, but you do want to cut back.

Don’t Drink Soda Pop!

Walk!

Don’t Pig Out! (Portion Control)

If you do any one of these three very simple things, it will help you lose fat. If you do all three of these things, you will be more healthy, feel better, burn more calories and lose more fat!

Thanks for reading and I hope it helps you or someone you know, I’d love to hear from you!

Well, I’m feeling a bit thirsty now, so I think I’ll go have a refreshing glass of ice water topped off with a juicy lime wedge and then go for a short walk in the great outdoors…

Health,Am I too dumb to succeed?,"I'm a second year computer science student and I'm about to start my Spring semester and I'm getting worried.  I just barely passed a few of my classes last semester and I'm beginning to think that I'm too dumb to succeed.

When I was in high school, I always hated myself.  If I did something stupid, whether it was missing a deadline for something or forgetting to do something or even having a situation where I thought I made myself look like an idiot in front of other people then I would harp on it for weeks, months or even years(hell sometimes I think about those times and hate myself) and I would periodically hit myself in the head and punch myself in the face or broke something in my room because I thought so much about what other people thought of me.  I guess I felt some release of frustration when I hit myself or punched a wall or something.  My mom took notice eventually and she got me to stop doing it but I still get the urge to do it sometimes when I do poorly on an exam or when I have trouble comprehending something.

I'm in college now and sometimes I study a lot but I feel like its to no avail.  I feel like I have a very difficult time comprehending what I read.  Reading textbooks or even fiction, I feel like I have to read every line 5 times to understand what I am reading.  I also have trouble reading when there is something going on around me.  If a TV is on or if the radio is on or if my window is open or even when I'm at the library and two people are whispering to each other, I find it impossible to digest anything that I read.  I've also come to realize that my memory seems to be poor.  Ill forget things I learned only one month after I had learned it.  Taking final exams feels like everything is foreign and I don't understand how I pulled a 90 in some exams after reviewing the material.

I easily lose concentration for 10-20 minutes at a time without realizing it and the second I do realize it, I want to smash my head on the table, I want to rip my $200 textbook in half and I want to smash my cell phone on the floor for being so fucking dumb and not concentrating but I don't and I feel like that anger just builds up and builds up.  I usually lift weights to relieve myself of the frustration but sometimes even that's not enough and I feel the compulsion to break something, anything.

I feel like the years of hitting myself in the head has done some permanent damage to my ability to comprehend what I read and sometimes I hope or even pray that I have a learning disability or something so that I can take some magical pill that will allow me to sit down and read entire textbooks without having to read every line 5-6 times to understand what it is I'm reading and stop losing focus all the time.

Maybe I'm normal.  Maybe this is what everyone goes through but nobody says anything because they aren't quite as weak as me.  Maybe me making this typing all of this out as if I'm different is a true sign of my weakness.

tl;dr: My reading comprehension is awful, I have terrible memory, I cant focus when there are things going on around me and I don't retain the things I learn as well as I think I should.",22,26,2012-01-15,PHARMA,0.09857776015996933,0.8690385222434998,0.03238369897007942

Health,Help. My girlfriend has been in agony for days and we don't have a clear diagnosis.,"So, my girlfriend, who is 24, has been in excruciating pain since basically the day after Christmas. She is constantly light-headed, has a terrible headache, has had weakness, nausea and vomiting, and cannot walk more than a few feet without getting very dizzy and falling over. She also cannot see well. Her vision is blurry, spotty and she is basically functionally blind.  

To compound this, she has had a leg/back issue for a couple months that has gotten much worse with her new head problem. It is only on her left leg, and it is agonizing for her to basically move her leg. She gets sharp pain in her hip and thigh, though only on the one side. 

Her doctor has said that stretching will help the leg, it really doesn't, and suggested we see a chiropracter, which didn't really help. 

He also said he believes she has viral meningitis based on her head symptoms, but that is supposed to go away on its own after about 10 days. We are at 3 weeks. He took a spinal tap yesterday and we have not heard the results. 

What else can this be and what can be done to make her feel better? I feel awful that she cannot move without yelping like a hurt puppy, and it is frustrating me to no end that nothing that I can do even makes her symptoms feel better. 

She is on Vicadon and some nausea medication. 

Edit: Went to ER, we spent 5 hours waiting and they ended up just giving an IV and a ""talk to your GP in the morning"".

Health,Ask Health: Peeing way too much?!,"Hey, so I've had a problem for a few years where I have always needed to pee far too much. I take no drinks when I leave the house, as any drink makes me need to pee maybe 5 minutes later. Per hour I probably urinate somewhere between 2 and 5 times on extreme. I have talked to my doctor about this but he seemed to brush over it without care. I do have anxiety issues and so I have always kind of put this down to an anxiety thing, but It happens when I am calm and at home as well.

Two days ago I went to hospital for a kidney stone (ouch), and during that I had an ultrasound. She scanned my kidneys and bladder and commented offhand that there is not much in my bladder. But at the time, I was busting to go to the bathroom! I don't know what is causing this and no one seems to care, but it stops me from going to restaurants and bars and even peoples places. I hate embarrassingly getting up in front of everyone multiple times to use the bathroom, it always gets questions and I have no real reasoning behind it.

I have a constant and extreme sensation that I need to defecate. It's as though my rectum is full and I'm desperate to run off and use the toilet. Even after doing so, I have no relief at all from that feeling, and still feel completely full. This is the case even after fasting and enemas, when I know my bowel is completely empty. I also get diahorrea much more than is normal, with bouts of it every 4 or 5 days or so. 

I have a similar, less extreme problem with my bladder. It feels constantly full and like I need to urinate. Again, this doesn't go away even when I know I have emptied my bladder. 

After ejaculation, I have a very uncomfortable feeling which is hard to explain. It's almost as though there's something lodged in the end of my penis, and this lasts for a few hours afterwards. 

I have no pain in the area. 

Maybe not related, but I also have a very dry mouth. 

Things we have tried haven't helped are:

Anti-depressant medications.

Anti-convulsant medications.

Blood tests for celiac/chrons. 

2 colonoscopys, my bowel looked normal.

Tests for rectal intsussepcion/prolapse. 

A low FODMAP diet. 

A course of meditation therapy. 

Most recently, a blood screen for auto-immune diseases gave a mixed result, with a positive ANA but negative ENA and Double stranded DNA (whatever that means). 

I know this is a long read, so thanks so much for taking the time and any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I'm going to bed now (Australia) but thought I should post when the most people were awake, so I'll check back in the morning.",22,27,2012-01-16,PHARMA,0.08214140683412552,0.8840551376342773,0.03380348160862923

Health,"Scumbag Shane Alferos, Gold's Gym at Fullerton","I’m writing this to expose the insulting and unprofessional treatment I got while visiting the Fullerton Gold’s Gym.

I’m a member of 24 Hour Fitness, but I decided to visit Gold’s Gym because of the great reviews I’ve both read online and heard from my friends. When I visited the Fullerton location, I had the displeasure of meeting sales manager Shane Alferos. When Mr. Alferos and I were discussing my budget, he said that a gym like Gold’s was considered to be a more elite establishment, and if I had trouble coming to terms with the price, then maybe I would be better suited to returning to my regular gym. I had a problem with this for two reasons:
A.	If I think a gym is too expensive, I’ll come to that conclusion on my own. I don’t need your assumptions or input on my financial situation.
B.	Patronizing your customers by saying that they’re too poor or you’re too elite for them is a horrible, horrible way to attract new clientele.

Still, I let this go without incident because I wanted to see the facilities in person and I didn’t want to let this guy get into my head.
A few days ago, I took my mother to visit the Fullerton Gold’s Gym. I figured that if she’d like it, I’d enroll her. I might’ve decided that I wouldn’t need to spend $50/month on a gym membership, but I’d be more than willing to do that for my mom if she wanted. This time around, we got a gym tour from Mo Mustafa, who’s every bit the consummate professional you’d want to meet at a new gym. He even let us explore the gym when I asked to talk to my mom privately about enrolling in the gym. After the tour, I asked him about membership plans and he stated it was $59.99, but since it was an open house, he called over a sales manager to see if he could get us a better rate. Lo and behold, Mr. Alferos appeared. When we were discussing the different types of plans and rates that would fit my mom, Mr. Alferos turned back to the team and loudly stated “they’re from 24” like we were outsiders. I might have been a little annoyed by his patronizing jabs the first time, but I was beyond annoyance when he pulled that same treatment with my mom. I asked to speak to his supervisor, and while he was made to “apologize” for his behavior, all he did was restate his previous points and even tried to justify his actions. His supervisor said that this wasn’t the first time Mr. Alferos had acted rude to customers, and it wasn’t even the first time he’s dismissed customers by suggesting they go to 24 Hour Fitness.

In all, it was a bad experience and I highly recommend that people look to another Gold’s Gym, or another gym entirely, other than the Fullerton Gold’s Gym. Guys like Shane Alferos don’t deserve to keep their jobs, and people that are just trying to exercise shouldn’t be insulted by the gym they’re checking out.",4,15,2012-01-16,PHARMA,0.16840986907482147,0.802055299282074,0.029534893110394478

Health,I recently witnessed the evil of health insurance companies.,"I'm currently getting my master's to be something called a perfusionist (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfusionist).  I pump and oxygenate people's blood with the heart-lung machine while their heart is stopped during heart surgery (called cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)).  I'm doing a rotation at a local teaching hospital, and they do something called isolated liver perfusion for patients suffering from hepatic cancer.  Just as the name implies, the liver is isolated from the rest of the body's circulation and hyperthermic chemotherapy drugs are circulated through it with what is essentially a smaller version of the CPB circuit.  The liver is bypassed with a separate CPB circuit.

Anyways, I got the hospital one morning a couple weeks excited to do my first surgery involving this.  The surgery began without any problems and the surgeons had begun to expose the liver (which is a lengthy process).  The phone in the OR rang, and the nurse, visibly angered by the conversation, hung up after a few minutes and told the surgeon that they had to stop. **The insurance company received the patient's payment two days late, and so they refused to pay for the treatment.**  Apparently someone working for this insurance company was doing some final checks that morning and found this error.  It had been missed before because how else could the patient have reached this point unless it was given the green light from the insurance company?  There was no proof that the patient had mailed the payment late; it could've gotten delayed at the post office for all they know.  As a result, they had to just close the patient back up and take them back to the ICU without treatment.

I've heard stories about insurance companies doing shitty things to people, but I've never witnessed something this awful.",135,211,2012-01-19,PHARMA,0.20156002044677734,0.7760104537010193,0.02242952212691307

Health,"Hate to do this, but what's wrong with my lungs??","For a little over a week, I've been having chest pains.  It was a sharp pain in my right lung that hurt when I laughed or took a deep breath, so I ended up with a little bit of shortness of breath just because I wasn't inhaling all the way.  I googled it, and it sounded exactly like pleurisy, so I started taking ibuprofen (800mgs).  On Tuesday I went to Urgent Care and the doc said he couldn't hear anything and the chest x-rays showed up clean, so he couldn't say definitively, but that it sounded like pleurisy and to keep taking the ibuprofen for a few days.  Tuesday was also the first day I started coming down with a cold, which brought him to the conclusion that the two were linked (viral pleurisy), but that I was fine to go back to work.


The cold's just about done, and I skipped about 18 hours of ibuprofen a little over a day ago because I was feeling better.  At the end of the workday yesterday, I was back to chest pains, although this time they weren't as localized.  Right now it's a general tightness (in the right lung, although I can't point out *as* specifically as before where it was).  It kind of feels like the same tightness when you swallow a HUGE bite of something and it moves really slowly down your chest (although I can feel the pain is in my lung).  The first part of the day was alright, because I was sitting down, but the second half of the workday I had to leave work early because I had to walk and talk to people and I just couldn't do it (I've been at that job for 6 months and have even thrown up at work and kept going, this was the first time I've *ever* gone home sick).  It was definitely a sharper pain later last week/Sunday, but I was also able to keep working through it (something I was unable to do last night).


Now that the pain is a little different and seems to not be improving (even with ibuprofen, it still hurts), I'm wondering what else it could be, or if it's developed into something else.  I have no fever and apart from the cold that I'm just about finished with, there's no other symptoms.  Just chest pain and shortness of breath.


I have a once in a lifetime trip coming up Monday-Weds that I will do just about anything not to miss (a film I worked on is being featured at Sundance), but the urgent care centers in my area are closed for the weekend and I don't think it's worth an ER visit, especially since I'd rather not expose myself to more illnesses in the waiting area.

I am not a bad writer but I just have a hard time writing about myself and I don't want to sound like I am conceited and arrogant, but I also don't want to leave out accomplishments. Do you have any suggestions that could help me with writing my personal statements? 

I was looking on Amazon and I found this book:

Do you know of any books like this but for pharmacy? I am not looking for pre-written essays or even a template but more of a guide that can help me write out my views in the best way possible.

pharmacy,Question for any who have taken the computer-based PCAT: How long did it really take to get your official scores:,"I'm just curious.  I'm at the point where I've taken the PCAT and submitted my PharmCAS application, so I'm just restless waiting around to see my official scores and get invited to an interview.  I already have my preliminary scores so at least I'm not going completely insane with anticipation, but I'd still really like to see how I did on the essay portion.

I know they say ""within 5 weeks"", but in your experience is it closer to 5 weeks or is that just a significant overestimate to account for any potential delays?

Health,"I sleep multiple times throughout the day everyday, What is wrong with me?","*Didn't get much of a response from askreddit so i figured i would try a more oriented subreddit.

I typically sleep 6-8 hours on weeknights and 12 hours on weekends. On week days, i normally sleep for a half hour around 12ish followed by sleeping again around 3-4 for about two hours. On weekends, i also sleep at around 4 but for more like three or four hours. I used to use an extremely high amount of caffeine to fight the tiredness. I decided to kick caffeine because i thought it could actually be the cause. It's been two weeks with no caffeine and it's no better.

I originally thought it could be narcolepsy, but after some research that doesn't seem to be the case. Narcolepsy is typically very short naps (7-15 minutes) whereas mine are much longer. I also have no signs of Caterplexy (spelling?). I doubt its sleep apnea because i am very skinny (6'1"", 157lbs). If i don't sleep during the day, i'm just not there mentally. I am barley able to pay attention in classes. I find that i am the most tired after eating and after driving.

Do you have any clue whats causing this or is it somewhat normal? I am already planning to see my doctor and then possibly a psychologist. Askreddit proposed hypothyroidism, depression, and anemia.",13,9,2012-01-22,PHARMA,0.08633445203304291,0.884404182434082,0.02926134504377842

Health,What is falling out?,"This is not a ""should I see a doctor"" question.. I hadn't done any coke in about 5 years.  I was hanging out over at a friend's house and decided to indulge.  Probably had a 1 mg or so of Xanax, marijuana a fair amount of alcohol and a smallish amount of good coke (did small lines every 30 mins or so).  Anyway I got up to use the bathroom and felt a bit ""odd.""  I was standing in front of the toilet and all of a sudden I got a really warm feeling, and my vision started to tunnel.  I knew I was about to pass out but didn't care. I woke up a minute or two later to someone pounding on the bathroom door - I knew where I was and everything but had hit my head hard enough that I was bleeding.

I'm not looking for medical advice (in the strict sense). I know I should have seen a doctor about this just in case but didn't.  I felt weird for a month after maybe, but still haven't died over a year later now.

What I am interested in is a medical explanation of falling out like that.  I know it probably has to do with the brain being oxygen-starved... But what are some of the possible logistics of how that can happen? Bp issues?  Arterial spasming?   Underlying condition?

Again, I'm not asking for medical advice.  I am, however, asking for links to more in depth info about what may have happened that I will probably be using to retroactively self-diagnose myself in an extremely irresponsible way.

Health,Question about the HIV window period? Need help putting anxiety to rest,"To begin, I've had a few girlfriends over the past few years but I've never had sex, or oral (sadface). Quit smoking weed 15 months ago due to health anxiety that plagued me (still does, to a much less extent though). I was convinced that I might have contracted HIV (for no reason at all) from smoking joints with friends that have had many sexual partners, and didn't practice safe sex much. One incident was smoking with a friend who had dry blood on his face and possibly his mouth, another one being someone mentioning having a cut on their lip. I did not have a ""cut"" at either time, but pretty chapped lips which cracked and sometimes bled.

A week after I quit and about 3 months after these 2 events, I had enough of the anxiety and ordered a blood test which included the HIV test, got the results a week later being negative. Now I keep hearing about a 6 month window period so technically I could have still been in that period.

I haven't had any of the initial symptoms, but I have had a dry cough in the mornings and sometimes in the day for almost a year now which my doc attributes to allergies, but could also be due to low humidity or even possibly GERD as I do get acid reflux/heartburn at times. 

Is there any real need for worry, or am I just wasting everyone's time?

TL:DR Still a virgin, got tested 3 months after thinking I had contracted it from sharing a joint, tested negative, unsure about window period (6 months)

Thanks guys

Health,Caffeine withdrawal,"About a month ago I started drinking coffee pretty heavily, the first two weeks I drank as much as one cup a day. After that, I began to drink two to three cups of coffee a day. Before then, I wasn't much of a coffee or tea drinker, probably 2 cups of tea a week. I don't drink soda at all too, due to my weight loss diet.

Well, 5 or 4 days ago I felt like the effect of the coffee to boost my concentration had diminished greatly, I didn't feel as energized as before anymore. So, stupidly, I stopped consuming any caffeinated drinks altogether. Little did I know that would lead to caffeine withdrawal syndrome, which I think I'm suffering right now. 

The day after stopping, I felt such a huge headache, it was hard to concentrate, I felt depressed and anxious at times. I have difficulty sleeping without waking up in the middle of night. Probably wake up twice or thrice every night. 

Finally, today I read up some articles on the internet and found that I'm suffering from this syndrome called caffeine withdrawal. Many articles suggested to wean off the caffeine instead of stopping altogether (cold-turkey route). Nevertheless, It's been probably 4 or 5 days since I stopped taking any caffeine. Would I be better off to just continue going cold turkey or wean it off? How long does this withdrawal last usually if I go cold turkey?

Sorry if there is any grammar error that annoys you, I'm still learning English.

*edit: Thanks for the advices so far guys, as I can afford to be not productive for the next 5 days I think I'll continue going on cold turkey for now. If the symptoms still persist after that then I'll try the weaning off method.",24,16,2012-01-23,PHARMA,0.21214821934700012,0.7588101029396057,0.029041621834039688

Probably my favorite transcription error was ""carcinoma ptosis"".

We have one attending who's notorious for how he dictates.  He has some hilarious notes, and it's even funnier when you realize that he dictates these in front of the patient.  Here's a sample:

&gt;The patient is not a very good historian.  When we first met him, we looked at his abdomen. We saw multiple scars, hernias, and an ileal loop, and we asked him what operations he had had.  He responded he had never been operated on.

Over the years this have progressively gotten worse, up to a point it happens everytime I fall asleep while sitting upright.

A month ago it happend while I was on the bus home, but now I dreamt that the buss was skidding sideways up the road with another bus driving straight against me, but since I couldnt move I was unable to brace for the impact. This happened a few times, as the ""dream"" reset. The last time it happened before I was on a boat, on the road, skidding sideways off the road towards a forest,

Tonight, for the first time, it happend while I was sleeping in my bed. But because of the hallucinations I heard two people directly behind my bed whispering. But due to the paralyzis I was unable to defend myself/see who it was. It was a greatly terrifying experience.

Is this a common, and is it possible to get medical help to avoid it? I am conscious during the experience, but unable to fully grasp the situation and sometimes partially unable to recognize my surroundings.",30,25,2012-01-30,PHARMA,0.2782931327819824,0.6957178711891174,0.02598896436393261
