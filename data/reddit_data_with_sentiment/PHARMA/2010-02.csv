Health,I quit drinking soda cold turkey. I'm on day 5.,"After reading [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/atk6x/if_money_free_speech_is_it_not_unconstitutional/c0jbz7m) and the comments under it, I decided to stop drinking sodas as an attempt to begin living healthier. I kept the rules simple: drink nothing I consider to be a soda. Not the most precise way of going about it, but this included a carbonated, sugary drinks laden with HFCS and caffeine.

I was a total addict. I would drink about 3 or more cans a day of soda, usually Coke or Dr Pepper. I would feel shitty and upset until I got a soda at lunch, which would make me feel wonderful. I loved the way it tasted, I loved the way my lunch tasted with it. 

Even though I am skinny, I was afraid that if my metabolism started slowing down, so much soda meant I would quickly pack on weight. Also, with the ridiculous amounts of sugar, diabetes was always a scary but real danger. So I decided begin a healthy revolution for myself by not drinking sodas.

Day one went without incident. I grabbed a metal bottle and filled it with water, and this bottle has followed me throughout. I drank water for lunch and meals, but I wasn't particularly thirsty the whole day. I missed the taste of soda. I started getting a headache by the end of the day.

Day two was terrible. I was tired, and felt disconnected from reality.  I had a constant headache, and it got worse throughout the day. Anti-headache medicines could not fight my body's wrath at the sudden starvation of sugar and caffeine. In a desperate effort to stave off headaches, I got some coffee to see if my body would take the peace offering of caffeine through a medium that isn't soda. This made things worse, as soon I found myself shaking (as coffee usually makes me do) and I still had a headache. I shook myself to sleep.

Day three might have been the worst. My headaches from day two carried over, but were dulled a bit. Some excedrin kept them away for a bit. But while in my blessed excedrin-high, I decided to get some sexual release, and I was slammed with the worst headache of my life. I could feel this headache bearing down on the top of my head, like nothing I had ever felt before. I tried to sleep, but laying down didn't seem to stop this monster of a headache. I eventually got to sleep, and when I woke up, the typical dull headaches were back. My body was not happy with me.

Day four was better. I had even lesser headaches, and some advil seemed to end them one hundred percent. I started actually being thirsty for water, and not just drinking it at meals because I am American and I have to drink *something* at meals. I drank water and enjoyed it. As the night went on, my headaches seemed to go away.

And here I am, living through day five. I haven't had a headache today, and I've had my trusty metal water bottle by my side to keep me hydrated. I didn't talk to any doctors or nutritionists before doing this, and some redditors may find some things that I did very wrong, but I feel like I achieved my goal. I'm hoping as time goes on, I'll feel healthier. My eating habits aren't particularly stellar, but this is a good place to start.",42,21,2010-02-01,PHARMA,0.15243278443813324,0.8196625709533691,0.027904639020562172

Health,Local Diet Doctor puts wife on unbalanced diet?,"My wife just realized that she's gained wait since the wedding and starting birth control, so without telling me, she went to the weight loss doctor. For forty bucks, he gave her some diet pills (good for a fast start I guess) and put her on a restricted diet. She's not to have even a drop of oil, butter, or any other fat. She's to cut the refined sugar. The odd thing is that he's eliminated **both** dairy and meat from her plate, and didn't suggest an alternate form of protein. He didn't tell her to exercise, but I feel that's an important part of any lifestyle change. He also didn't regulate her starch intake.

So now she's essentially on a pseudo-vegan diet without a good source of protein (don't mention soy to her), and without a limit to her starch intake. It just doesn't seem balanced, especially since she will be exercising, and she will need something to support muscle repair. She won't be taking in enough fat to keep skin/nerves/etc healthy.

Health,What's in your gullet?  Does fast food make you dumb and fat?,"I’m starting to wonder why there aren’t more discussions on reddit, discussing the negative effects of fast food on the body and the brain.  Here on reddit there is an abundance of free thought.  We address topics like atheism and the state politics, but there is a distinct lack of posts addressing the negative effects of fast food on people’s health and wellbeing.  I just don’t see how we can discuss issues like Universal Healthcare while the neglecting to mention how the “food” industry can make us unhealthy.  

The issue is not just about the rising rate of obesity in America.  These “foods” have other effects on people, effects less obvious than just the physical bulging of waistline.  These additional side-effects are insidious and hidden, and require scientific methods to analyze just how bad fast food alter our brain chemistry and diminishes our health.  

I found one article that stated the effects of one (1) high fat meal on the body won’t go away for about 6 hours.  (For the sake of comparison that’s longer than the effects of drinking an entire pitcher of beer.)  We are reaching the point where scientists are finding similarities between the food industry and drugs as addictive as heroin.  And it is time we address it.

I want to see more attention given to this issue.  Who has a good source for reputable information about this topic?  I’ve included the links I have, please share yours.  

Let’s start the Real Food Revolution on reddit!  Who’s with me!

Health,Dear Redditors who insist obesity is always a lifestyle choice: Screw You! (Said with glee),"Five years ago, I was at a reasonable weight. Not skinny, not fat. Then I went on medication for anxiety. Over the ensuing years, I gained seventy pounds and became obese. I had to deal with doctors (doctors, who should KNOW better, because they should know the meds I was on would affect my weight) dismissing anything and everything as due to my weight and needing more exercise when I was getting exercise and doing whatever I could to lose weight... and still gaining it.

Three weeks ago I saw a sleep specialist for my chronic insomnia. It had never occurred to me that my insomnia might also be linked to the same meds. My psychiatrist was too busy telling me to get more exercise to bother thinking of it, either.

Sample conversation with now-fired psychiatrist:

Me: My insomnia is getting a lot worse.
Him: You should get some exercise.
Me: I *have* been. I've been exercising regularly five days a week.
Him: Even just a ten-minute walk.
Me: (Stares at him in disbelief)

The sleep specialist put me on another med to counteract the first med's side effects, and had me use sleep restriction therapy (very restricted and specific sleep hours, starting at four hours a night for four days, working my way gradually up from there).

Now I sleep just fine. I've also lost four pounds in three weeks without even really trying, whereas before I had to struggle like mad just to avoid gaining weight.

So yes, some fat people are lazy. But next time you see someone who's overweight, try to remember that believing they're lazy might just be a really stupid assumption on your part. There's a very wide variety of medical problems and medication side effects that can cause tremendous weight gain.

As for me, I'm giddy. I can concentrate again. I have energy. And dammit, now that I'm capable of losing weight again, I'm going to have fun doing so!",173,35,2010-02-11,PHARMA,0.08208093047142029,0.8901572823524475,0.02776179276406765

Health,A question to all the healthy eaters on reddit health.,"Within the past two weeks, I undertook changing my diet for the better (I am certifiably fat and want to not be).  Lots more plant matter, less fat, less sodium, etc.  I mostly eat vegetables and whole grains with some lean protein thrown in for good measure.  For the most part, I feel great physically and emotionally.  There is one big problem though.  I am getting god-awful amounts of gas.  Like painful amounts.  It doesn't smell, but it's very uncomfortable and it's only a matter of time before I drop a triple-L bomb (loud, long and lonely) at an inopportune moment.  Is this normal?  Does it subside?  Is there anything I can do in the mean time?  Or should I just get used to being gaseous?  

P.S. - This is a throwaway account so feel free to let the fart humor flow freely.

Health,Boycott GlaxoSmithKline! They hid that their drug caused thousands of heart attacks,"As reported by [the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/health/policy/20avandia.html), a Senate study reveals that GlaxoSmithKline's diabetic drug Avandia resulted in 83,000 heart attacks that wouldn't have otherwise happened if the victims were on a competing, similar drug.  What's worse even than the massive harm done to people's lives is that Glaxo *knew about the heart risk* for years before they did anything about it!

In order for capitalism to work, customers have to hold companies accountable for the damage that is caused by their products.  GSK knew that their profits came at the price of quality of life of tens of thousands of Americans, yet they didn't even inform their customers, much less pull the drug from the market, for years.

We need to make them feel the cost of their actions!  The following is a list, from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GlaxoSmithKline#Products) of popular (i.e., profitable), of drugs and other products made by GlaxoSmithKline.  Many of these products have cheaper, equally-effective generics, and several that aren't generic have similar drugs made by other companies.  Even if you're healthy and don't rely on these drugs, let your mother, grandfather and friends know how they can talk with their doctor and stand up for our safety!
