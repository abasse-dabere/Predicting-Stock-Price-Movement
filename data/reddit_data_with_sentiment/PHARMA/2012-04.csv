medicine,What is the purpose of the 'earth'/'neutral' electrode of an ECG (EKG)? (askscience xpost),"Looking for a fairly specific explanation here.

In a standard 12 lead ECG generally, 10 electrodes are connected to a person. 6 electrodes are on the precordium and represent V1-V6 alone - nothing interesting there.

The limb electrodes are right arm, left arm, and left leg. From these three connections you can get 3 bipolar leads (I: RA to LA, II: RA to LL, III: LA to LL). Because each lead has a positive and negative electrode equidistant from the electrical centre of the heart, you can work out a zero point at the centre of this vector traingle (Einthoven's triangle) and come up with three unipolar leads from the centre; aVR, aVL, aVF. All this makes perfect sense and brings us up to 12 leads.

Which brings us to the neutral or earth lead, commonly connected to the right leg when setting up an ECG. I understand that it's supposed to be the 'electrical earth' or zero point from which current is measured, but I don't really have the understanding of physics/electricity to understand what that means? Why do you need this additional electrode, and why does it provide any additional information over the left leg lead in producing an ECG?

Thanks in advance.",9,10,2012-04-01,PHARMA,0.02184007316827774,0.9350565075874329,0.043103426694869995

Health,Allergy Shots; Should I continue?,"I haven't seen much on allergy shots, nor am I sure this is the right place to post.

I have very severe environmental allergies. I'm basically allergic to everything. I get weekly allergy shots in hopes it will help. I have been getting them for about 6 months with no improvement.

At this point I am having to repeat doses 2-3x because of how bad the swelling is. I get 3 a week, and one of them is much worse than the others. The area on my arm swells to about the size of a tennis ball, maybe a bit smaller. And the lump is hard and sensitive as fuck. It is painful for about 2 days after the shot, then it dies down. The other two injection areas swell to about quarter size and then die down. 

My allergies have not seen any improvement, possibly worsened.

medicine,Have you performed/assisted with performing an abortion?,"I am a premed student. While I know that I might change my mind any number of times between now and graduation from med school, right now my goal is to do women's reproductive health, with a focus on providing abortions, including late-term abortions when necessary. I know that it is a very hard path to follow, and there will be a fair amount of social stigma associated with it, but this is an aspect of health care that I feel very strongly about, and think that it should be an option to those who need it. I would obviously not do anything that I felt violated my personal ethical code, but it is a service that should absolutely be available to women who need it, and I think I would be capable of providing it with compassion and understanding. I currently volunteer at Planned Parenthood, and am a clinic escort when my schedule allows.

Here is my question- have you performed an abortion (or more than one)? How did it make you feel? Were there any unexpected aspects of it? Did classmates, teachers, or anyone else ever make you feel uncomfortable about it? Any other thoughts on the subject, in relation to the attitude of the medical community towards people who want to perform abortions (want being a somewhat misleading term- it would be nice if there was no need to do so, but there is, so, here I am)?",43,25,2012-04-02,PHARMA,0.090039923787117,0.871962308883667,0.03799774870276451

pharmacy,CVS won't promote me to an Intern,"I'm a P1 and have worked at CVS for 4 years as a technician.

It's almost the end of the year and my District Manager still won't promote me to intern. All my classmates I've spoke with (who also work at CVS) are interns. 

I've had an interview with the Intern coordinator and I felt it went OK. I have lots of work experience with the company, obviously, and all three pharmacist's I've worked with love me. They think it's nonsense I am not promoted yet and even spoke with the DM about it.

My current PIC spoke with the DM and said CVS is concerned that I don't agree with all their programs, such as PCQ. This stems from a conversation I had with DM where I said CVS calls the customers too much and it bothers people. I said I get prescriptions at CVS, my sister does, and my mother, so I can understand when patients complain about all the calls because it is annoying.

She said I should know why we call customers and it's for their benefit.

Don't know if I should stick it out with CVS or try to get hired somewhere else. My salary isn't the issue. I already make $13/hr so that's not the reason for not promoting.

TLDR;
- Been with CVS for 4 years
- DM thinks I don't agree with CVS's ""helpful programs"" and thus not intern worthy

I've always been enthralled by the field of medicine and have always planned on having some sort of career in it, but I was recently diagnosed with a condition which won't allow me to stand or walk for extended periods of time (the most I can do is around an hour before having to rest) and requires me to walk with a cane. 

While I've planned to go down the MD track my entire life, it seems that from what I've heard, it's going to be impossible for me to be an actual doctor with this disability. Is it at all possible that a future employer might make accommodations for me, or are my dreams in becoming a doctor completely squashed?

I was hoping that someone else might have had a similar experience and can give me some incite or even something I can do at home to help.

My problems started January 2011 when I had the worst sinus colds of my life. Since then my ears have been popping nonstop whenever I swallow or move my facial muscles. To begin with I was just having ear pain, sinus pain, and headaches occasionally or when I was sick. I went to the walk in clinic and was told that I needed some earwax cleaned out of my ears. The ear wax removal stopped the pain for a while but the popping continued. About a month or so later I started having the pain on and off again. 

Things started to get worse about 5 months ago and since then the ear pain, sinus pain, and headaches have gotten a lot worse and more frequent. Since then I have been seeing the doctor regularly and he has been prescribing me nasal sprays. These seem to have stopped the nasal pain but have done nothing for my ears. Every time he looks into my ears he says that they are completely clean with no infection and he doesn't see any fluid behind the ear drum.

Currently I am experiencing constant mild ear pain, headaches, fatigue, and constant ear popping but about once a week I get migraine like headaches (with sensitivity to light and noise), extreme ear pain, dizziness, and mild nausea. Whenever the extreme pain comes on I am forced to stop when I am doing and curl up in bed hoping it will be over soon. Lying down holds no relief though as even just my pillow touching my head causes extreme pain. I am reliant on the painkillers just to get me through each day but those come with their own set of side effects as well. 

I have been doing some searching online but nothing seems to really fit what is going on with me. Hopefully one of you have overcome something similar and can help me out. (:",8,7,2012-04-13,PHARMA,0.22038085758686066,0.7498797178268433,0.029739441350102425
medicine,Please help me understand how one can have a fatal heart attack missed by doctors?,"My husband, 45 years old, thin, active (smoker though) recently passed away from a fatal heart attack.  He had no previous history except in the early 90's was told that he had a heart murmur during a pre-employment physical.  (His late mother had heart attacks) He NEVER went to the doctor......until the last couple of months before his demise.  He had been complaing of back &amp; left shoulder pain (but his shoulder had bothered him for years so I thought it was the same) as for the back pain I told him he should go to the doctor.  He did not have medical insurance due to layoffs, was unemployed, so for him to feel the pain was bad enough to go to the Urgent Care/Emergency Room Hospital &amp; pay out of pocket speaks for itself.  They told him he had strained his back and gave him a perscription for Ultram.  He went back several times because it was not improving.  They just kept taking his money, wrote the prescriptions, and sent him on his way.  The Sunday after Thanksgiving he had mentioned that he felt ""funny"" but couldn't elaborate, and that his left arm ached and thought he had slept on it wrong, but I don't know if he told them when he went to the Urgent Care that afternoon (I wish I had went with him-but I didn't).  They just wrote him a refill.  He left the facility on foot and headed to the drug store (which is just across the parking lot about 50 yards) and just after entering the store he stumbled, sat on floor short of breath and collapsed.  By the time the paramedics got there he was already gone.  They were unable to revive him.  The autopsy revealed that the heart attack (""Cardiac Insufficiency"") was due to Aortic Stenosis and Cardiomegaly, and that they have been present for years.  I have been doing some research trying to make sense of it all and have found that the stenosis can be detected by hearing a murmur.  I obtained the Urgen Care's records and they marked the box that indicated no murmer present.  I would really like to know how the stenosis can be so bad that it causes a fatal heart attack yet be missed by the doctor who saw him literally just minutes before the fatal event?  It just doesn't seem right.   Am I wrong in believing they should have caught it?",28,5,2012-04-13,PHARMA,0.21943168342113495,0.7537035942077637,0.02686469815671444

Health,Is this an Ocular migraine? description and questions inside.,"So, I just had what I think was an ocular migraine. However, when I went to go look this up, wikipedia, webmd, and mayoclinic all give slightly different info than the other sites my husband found. 

All of a sudden this morning, I sat in front of the computer (reddit, what else!?!) and there was a large, C shaped, wavey-lined, floater on the leftish-central field of my vision. Unlike other small floaters, this didn't actually float. It stayed constant, it was hard to read through/around it, and I almost felt dizzy looking at the glare of the screen with it. I first worried I had a retinal tear, but realized that it was present for both eyes, whether open or closed. I had (and still have 2 hours later) no headache. Well, I've got a mild sinusy headache, but that's bilateral and directly where my sinus cavities are and my allergies are active. I haven't ever had a full-on migraine before, but I don't think this is it.  

My hubby said that this seemed to be the description of an ocular migraine, and that it would either get larger over my field of vision over the next 20-30 minutes (which it was in the process of doing while he looked this up) and go away (which it did), or it would do this and then culminate in a migraine headache. I think I dodged a bullet on it. 

So: what is the correct terminology for this? What causes it? Can I minimize the chance of it happening again? Is it worth an MD appointment especially for this, or just wait until the next time I see my MD?

Health,"My wife is extremely ill, and nobody knows why (didn't realize this still happened in modern medicine):","She is a 37-year-old, white female.  Began running high fever one day in Sept. 2010 (104F), about 4-months after our daughter was born.  Ended up being diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  Began treatment, which was actually quite successful, but was hospitalized through most of it due to the fever persisting as well as extensive nerve damage after the very first dose of chemo.  At one point she was transferred to MD Anderson in Houston and they said: 1. They had no idea why she still had fever, and 2. They'd never seen someone with such extensive nerve damage after one dose of chemo (loss of function from the knee down on both legs, drop foot, etc.).

Once treatment was over, she continued to improve and was even walking using a walker/braces.  Fever still hung around but was mainly low grade.  Around November of 2011, she had a few days of high fever again (103.8F at the highest).  It subsided, then came back again in December (almost exactly 4-weeks later).  Subsided again (never actually ""normal"", just down to 101F which is normal for her these days).  

Around Feb 2012, the fever was back, along with some mental confusion (which was new).  Went to the hospital and was determined she had a very bad UTI.  She was treated for it and released, but was so physically weak at this point that she had to go to the rehabilitation hospital.  She went back to the regular hospital in Mid-March 2012 with another high fever.  Thorough investigation revealed no abnormalities anywhere, on anything.  No infection, nothing.  At the end of March the local hospital had exhausted all their options so she was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.

She is still at the Mayo Clinic and has been there for 3-weeks.  Her fever has hung around 103F the entire time, and her function has been declining.  She is asleep most of the time, and delusional/confused during the brief moments she is awake.  She has trouble using her hands now and cannot feed herself or even use her phone (both are new problems).  The Mayo Clinic has done many new tests, as well as repeated old tests:  lumbar puncture, CT scans, PET scan, multiple blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, MRI, EEG, EMG, and so on... and has hit a brick wall every time.  Every single test is negative and shows NOTHING.

They did a lymph node biopsy yesterday so we are waiting on the results, but if it shows nothing then they are getting ready to discharge her to come home with no answers, and just basically waste away.  I always thought that Mayo was where you went when nobody else could figure it out... they are one of the top places in the world for diagnosing people when nobody else can, and even THEY can't figure this out.

How can someone this young be THIS sick and nobody knows why?  I've had friends and family who have dealt with serious illness, but never in my life have I been told, ""We don't know why this is happening.""

Have any of you been in a similar situation?  Do you know of any options we should try next?  I feel like we have done everything we can do and yet she continues to get worse and we have no answers at all.

medicine,Thinking of career change to medicine. Would appreciate any feedback.,"Current situation:  I'm a 28 yo mid-level Congressional staffer.  Career is the focus of my life b/c I'm truly content when I'm working with complex ideas and applying them to solve problems or create strategies.  I'm single, have no obligations, no debts, no plans of having a family, and don't intend to ever retire.  

Problem:  Starting 1.5 year ago, I've increasingly come to view my work in public policy as meaningless. Even though I'm advancing on to more complex projects, I'm often bored. I despise that logic and rationality don't matter.  Although my group is pretty far removed from politics, its still similar to working with lawyers in an adversarial system; the goal is to advocate instead of finding the truth or best solution (even when what we do should be objective work; e.g., documenting groundwater absorption rates f/ a toxicology assessment). 

I regret having gone down this career path, believe it's not a good match for my strengths and weaknesses, and am having trouble finding any meaning in my life (in an existential sense, mental/physical health is good). I want to dedicate my life to becoming an expert in a field where I can apply my knowledge and experience to help others.

Solution?:  After researching potential careers ad nauseum, I can't shake the feeling that medicine could be extremely exciting and rewarding.  It has the potential to be intellectually satisfying, there's never-ending research, colleagues would have high standards for performance,  I'd be able to apply science and see results, and, most significantly, there are few careers I think of that offer such a direct, immediate benefit to society. Also, I guess I'd be able to afford to help out my mom when she's older. 

Back to premed? I graduated in 2007 w/ polisci degree from a top SLAC, but started out as a bio/geo double major. Overall GPA 3.8; Science GPA 4.0, taken following courses: bio I, bio II, chem I, phy I (for life sciences), and and 3 geo courses.  Maths: algebra, calc (CLEP test). Granted, I'v forgotten a good bit of this and would need a refresher. The only med exposure I've had is a little admin. volunteering in a hospital and following my GP and OD for a couple days.  Unfortunately, due to recent string of family illnesses, I've been exposed to the world of specialists.  I'd never had any idea medicine is so deep and broad. 

Next step? I'm seriously considering this plan: 1) resign 2)self-review math/ basic sciences 3)  take chem II, o-chem, phys II at state uni. while gaining more clinical experience (ER volunteer?) 4) assess chance of MS admission 4) decide to give 100% to MS prep, or choose another field to devote myself.

Expedition Medicine is a field that I discovered a couple weeks ago, but I'm finding it extremely hard to find much relevant information about. Essentially, ""expedition medicine"" is accompanying some sort of expedition (research, business, filming, pleasure) in a remote area as a trained medical professional. The expedition would have to be big enough to afford hiring a doctor and the area would have to be remote, but it seems like this job exists in some forms.

Does anybody know anything about this kind of job? It doesn't seem like it is an established field, from everything I've seen online - but somebody out there has to be doing it. It sounds like something that would be absolutely right up my alley, but I'm trying to find more information about this kind of field, or similar ones. I've always dreamed about traveling and going to remote places like Antarctica, so this would basically be a dream job if it exists.

I was always fat since I could remember, but the Summer before high school I had lost a considerable amount of weight. I think it was about 60 lbs. I had some emotional issues and left school for independent study, in that time I ballooned up to 310 lbs. I was very large and had grown many stretch marks. I went back to school the following year and had naturally lost 40 lbs from not laying around so much. Then the summer before this current school year I have gone down to 220 lbs through cutting out a lot of calories. I was glad to have lost so much weight through healthier eating but I'm afraid I lost it too fast as now I have a lot of left over skin. It is quite unbearable at times to look at.

Health,Painful labia - doctor is no help. Anyone heard of anything like this??,"I really need help with an unknown condition - it's affecting my sex life and sanity!

24 y/o female, sexually active with one partner for 2 years. 

I've been experiencing a strange, annoying, pain for the past few months on one side of my inner labia, the other side is fine. It is sensitive to the touch, often hurts if I need to wipe after using the restroom. It sometimes swells to x3 its size and becomes even worse so that it's painful to sit or walk. I think it started around January/February and it seems to get better (but not disappear completely), then get worse. It actually seems to get worse right after I finish my period. The last 2 times it got worse, I had sex on the weekend, got my period Monday-Friday, then the labia would start bothering me Friday/Saturday. We used condoms and lube because it's a tight fit, but we've used them the past 2 years.

I've been to the gyno twice for this. The first time, it had started to get better although I could still feel it if touched directly. The doctor said she didn't see anything and gave me medicine for a yeast infection if it should get worse (the last 2 years I saw her she said my culture had a high level of yeast).

When it got worse, I applied that medicine and it didn't help. I saw her again when it was at it's worse. She looked at it and said it didn't look like herpes and that it wouldn't help to lance it, but that it felt hard under the skin. I was sent home with an antibiotic prescription that did nothing.

Now it's starting to get worse and I don't know what I should do. I don't want to go back to the same doctor as she hasn't helped at all, and I don't think my insurance will cover another gyno visit anyways.

I've tried sleeping without underwear (I'm overweight so it can get a bit sweaty), wash my underwear in hot water, dry them without a dryer sheet, I don't use any soap on the area - just hot water. During my period I use Pearl tampons and unscented light pads or pantliners. I'm on the birth control pill (sprintec) and a low dose antibiotic for acne. My gyno knows about the antibiotic and has told me it shouldn't affect the effectiveness of the pill too much.

medicine,Changing M3 Educational Structure,"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/19/reinventing-the-third-year-medical-student/

This article highlights a new approach to the third year of medical school being implemented at Harvard. Basically, the students follow 100 pts longitudinally throughout the year instead of the traditional rotating clerkships. The article is a little touchy-feely in that it talks about 'humanizing' the third year, but it does have a link to the related NEJM article. 

I can see the value of extended pt contact and the possible merit in being a stronger advocate for your pts when you follow them through the gauntlet of modern medicine. On the other hand, it seems like a logistic nightmare: what if one of your pts has a whipple scheduled the same day another one goes into labor / has an MI / requires intubation / gets RSV? Also, how do you go from being a green M2 to a skilled clinician by just seeing this small sample size?

I cannot fully comment until I read the related NEJM article at my library. Off the cuff though, I can't imagine that this new process will be nearly as rigorous as what I have experienced. 100 pts? really? A conservative estimate is that I saw &gt;1000 pts during third year, and I had to know everything about each of them. Also, how can one learn properly about a discipline without living and breathing it for a certain amount of time? I'm thinking of my OB rotation.... if I only had ~10 pregnant pts, what are the chances that I would see previa, abruption, NICU babies, etc? 

I'm starting a surgical residency in a few months, so take it with a grain of salt.... but I feel like you can inject a modicum of listening and hand-holding into your practice without this drastic revision of the curriculum. At the end of the day, you're the best advocate for your pts if you really know your clinical science, can (patiently) obtain a proper history and guide them. I feel like if you want to hand-hold, you can always be a social worker. 

The comments at the end of the article are fairly enlightening and run the gamut. Some of the students in the program rightly point out that you don't really learn all that much by holding a retractor for 4 hrs. We all know that there's a massive amount of inertia when it comes to medicine, and third year is a subjective experience that is largely attending-dependent.... but is this new system a good idea?

TL;DR: Harvard gets rid of traditional clerkships in favor of longitudinal f/u of a cohort of pts, good idea?",8,12,2012-04-23,PHARMA,0.03405032679438591,0.9306418895721436,0.035307738929986954

Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto-immune and inflammatory condition. As such, you may benefit from removing certain foods from your diet.

-Grains, especially wheat and anything that contains gluten
-Soy and other legumes including peanuts, conola oil, vegetable oil
-Dairy, maybe butter
-Vegetable oils
-Eggs
-Nightshades (peppers, eggplant, potato, and others)
-Red meat
-Sugars



Excess omega-6 intake and chronic omega-3 deficiency provoke inflammation (primary sources are grains and vegetable oils such as soy, corn, canola; these oils are ubiquitous in processed foods). You may also benefit from adding certain supplements to your diet, including vitamin D3, magnesium, digestive enzymes, and probiotics.


Eat lots of healthy animals and their fat, along with vegetables, and fruits and nuts on occasion.
Get plenty of sleep.
Get regular exercise – but not too much, and keep the Chronic Cardio to a minimum.
Get regular sun. (if you have inflamation you muscle supplement Vitamine D3 atleast 7-10,000 IU (trust me)
Don’t stress.

Some people suggest probiotic usage, either in supplement or whole food form (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut)( to help gut flora*DO MORE RESEARCH)

Eating fibrous vegetables fresh from the garden, unwashed, in order to feed your new flora as well as introduce new bacteria and new digestive enzymes to diversify your gut’s digestive skill set. Foods like jicama, onions, garlic, and Jerusalem artichokes provide the prebiotic inulin (a type of fiber) which gut flora consume and convert to helpful short chain fatty acids. Olive oil, or coconut oil!!!!!!!! LOWER omega 6 oils, INCREASE FISH OIL!!!! Short chain omega 3 - flax oil. Its not as valuable. Not the same as fish oil. 



**Suggestions that people have made:**


-turmeric 3x daily, (450mg)

-I'd suggest reading the books Anti-Cancer, Real Food, and looking into the GAPS Diet

-Google 'gelatin arthritis', or 'chicken cartilage arthritis', or 'gelatin ray peat'

-Ditch all artificial supplements in use, replace them with brewers yeast

- Optional stuff: organic apple cider vinegar (in water, with honey if you like) and/or blackstrap molasses (bsm+milk=yummy), these are good for you. That should cover almost all vit/min needs.

-floatation therapy

-look at plaquenil

-reiki treatments?

-colloidal minerals

-Search for YYYY's post in this thread. Very good link and information too

-PALEO DIET!!!!!

-Black Cherry concentrate

* How much did you make/year in your first few years out of residency?
* How much do you make now (and how far out are you from your training)?
* In general, do you make more or less than survey estimates/other colleagues?
* Where do you see your salary going in the next 15 years?

Some information: I walk/exercise frequently, at least 30-60 minutes of walking up/downhill a day and I weight lift 3-4 times a week. I eat on a primarily very high fat/low carb paleo diet with most of my calories coming from meat/eggs/olive oil and usually spend a majority of the week in ketosis. I also take fish oil everyday. 

I frequently doing intermittent fasting for 24-36 hour periods usually 2-3 times a week. The test was taken at 12pm on Friday and the last meal I had was Thursday at 6 and it was an extremely large fatty meal (2500-3000 calories with 250g of protein and the rest being fat. It's not uncommon for me to eat one meal a day that looks similar to this and then fast for 24-36 hours.

So that being said - I'm not sure how to interpret these results. I know that basically all of them are bad and the cholesterol/LDL levels are very alarming but I don't know if I might be missing something or if the numbers might be misleading. Is it possible that the last meal that I ate spiked up the results significantly? Any help is appreciated, thanks.",1,3,2012-04-28,PHARMA,0.051722776144742966,0.9057429432868958,0.04253428801894188

Health,Incomplete puberty?,"Hi all, i'm wondering if it's possible to start puberty but never actually finish it? Or only experience some changes while other changes are never reached? I've been trying to find out but can never find much helpful information... it's usually assumed that once u hit puberty then its all smooth sailing, more or less, into a fully mature adult. Not so for me

I'm a 24 year old guy and i'm sure that i never actually completed puberty.. like seriously. I'm stuck looking like a 14-15 year old boy.

I basically didnt hit puberty until i was well and truly 16 years old. I experienced the main textbook changes - appearance of pubic hair, underarm hair, voice changing, increased sexual interest/ability to ejaculate. Although my voice changed initially, it still sounds quite youthful (early to mid adolescence) and not like a man in his 20s.

What i NEVER experienced to this day, that i should've, was changes in my skeletor/muscular build. Changes such as broadening shoulders, wider chest, bigger hands, a more masculine frame. Basically my body has never changed shape. I know my own body and never experienced any changes in body frame - i still have narrow thin shoulders, small chest, boney girl arms, basically the same kind of body physique as a 12 year old boy. I know that changes can occur at different times and rates.. but eventually it all catches up and you finish, certainly by the time you reach your 20s.

I also never really experienced any growth spurt.. just basically grew steadily taller until i reached my adult height (5'6). Like a child from age 8 to 10 would have steadily grown taller, although largely the same body shape, if that makes sense.

Just for reference, i haven't completely stopped further development dead in its tracks... However, the only other changes to have *gradually* occurred since is some facial hair (albeit not very thick, partial coverage, slow to grow back once shaved) and some very light chest hair. For the most part, i havent changed that much the way i look now and when i was 16. As far as my body shape, it just hasn't changed at all. I still have a youthful looking face and overall young appearance, due largely to my immature body frame.

For those who still don't get my problem.. look up Andy Milonakis, a 31 year old stuck in the body of a preteen. I consider myself like a semi-Andy Milonakis.. not a complete absence of puberty, just partially complete, and being stuck in the body of an early teen.

So any ideas, suggestions as to what might cause such abnormal puberty progression?

medicine,"Who would be the biggest loser of health care reform? If we're spending $1 trillion more yearly than the next highest country, who's getting that money?","Most of what's involved in health care is not imported, so almost all the money spent on health care in the US goes from Americans to Americans. That means that if we are able to find a way to cut health care costs, it's going to be Americans from whom that money is cut. According to [this article in The Incidental Economist](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/what-makes-the-us-health-care-system-so-expensive-introduction/), the problem is _not_ with physician compensation. In 2006, physician salaries only accounted for $138 billion out of a total of $2,106 billion spent that year.

According to that article, the majority of the overspending is with outpatient care. Overspending in insurance administration, drugs, and health care investment combined is about half as much as overspending in outpatient care.

What I don't get is, how can overspending in outpatient care not be reflected in health care workers' compensation? Is the author wrong in his accounting of who's getting paid what money? Are there alternative theories concerning from whom all the money from hypothetical health care savings would come?

For example, in the book [_Money Driven Medicine: The Real Reason Health Care Costs So Much_](http://www.amazon.com/Money-Driven-Medicine-Reason-Health-Costs/dp/006076533X) it says:

&gt; Lucas County, Ohio, for example, boasts more than 250 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) units. “We always joke that it’s surprising your car doesn’t start veering if you’re driving on Monroe or Secor, there are so many magnets out there,” Dr. Peter Royen, a radiologist and medical director of Regency Imaging Center in Toledo, says, chuckling. Dr. Kenneth Bertka, a Toledo family physician and past president of the Ohio Academy of Family Physicians is decidedly less enthusiastic: “We don’t need this many MRI scanners in Toledo; there’s no question about that.”

That would seem to fall under health care investment overspending, at least initially. But then when I went to get an MRI scan recently, that would have been outpatient care. But who got the $1,800 they charged for that? Is that where the overspending in outpatient care is? Wouldn't that money go to the doctor who ordered the MRI? And if not does it just go to some random investor?

So if that last speculation is the case, is most of the overspending in US health care going to some random investors? Is that who's going to be the biggest loser in health care reform?",35,19,2012-04-30,PHARMA,0.08617696911096573,0.8852541446685791,0.02856895513832569
