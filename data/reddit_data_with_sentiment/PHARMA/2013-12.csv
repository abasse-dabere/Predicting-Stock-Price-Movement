Health,Debilitating hangovers after just a few drinks,"Last night, I went out for dinner a few drinks with friends. I drank a bottle of beer and 3 pints (2 wheat beers, 1 winter ale and a bottle of lager) over ~4hrs. When I got home, I drank about 300ml of water. 

I woke up this morning with a debilitating hangover. Insane headache and vomiting. It wasn't until after I had forced some food down at around 3pm that I started to feel better. This is fairly standard for me and I have had similar reactions after just 2 beers - though 2 beers usually just leaves me with a strong headache the next day.

I'm 33, 5'11 and 175lbs. 

In my late teens and early 20's I used to drink fairly regularly. A beer or two most nights and 2 nights a week getting slaughtered. While I'd experience hangovers when I got slaughtered they were about the same level as I experienced this morning and were somewhat justified.

Now a days, I'll have an occasional 1/2 drinks on the weekend and go out for drinks like last night about once a month. I am a lot healthier in general these days too. Gym 3/4 times per week and between 3-10hrs a week on my bike. I watch what I eat and make sure I stay hydrated. I'll get through about 2 litres of water a day while at work plus a few mugs of tea.

I get that people experience hangovers on different levels but this just seems excessive. Is it likely something in the drinks I am choosing or am I just one of the unlucky ones?",11,11,2013-12-01,PHARMA,0.05838381126523018,0.9070698022842407,0.03454636037349701

medicine,Feeling anxious about an upcoming surgery,"First time posting here; I read the sidebar and I don't think I'm violating any rules, but forgive me if I am. 

In two weeks I'll be undergoing an anterior lumbar fusion. I'm 34, recently married and have a baby on the way. I trust my Doctor (he's treated both my parents as well, and very successfully) but I'm feeling very nervous and anxious now that everything is coming down to the wire. I've had 3 other surgeries (knees and shoulder) before and while they were about a decade ago, I don't recall being this nervous. We decided on this course of treatment about 2 months ago. Today I had a pre-op and was fine until I had to give myself an injection as part of the treatment plan. Needles don't bother me (I'm covered in tattoos) and this is seriously the smallest needle I've ever seen, but at the last second I balked. I'm quite experienced in self-calming and meditation, so I took a moment to center myself and took a step back. I felt much better but before I could prepare myself again I broke down crying and went to my wife to talk about the apprehension that's been running through my mind for the past couple of days.  After talking to her (she's the best, I'm so lucky) I felt much better and gave myself the injection no hesitation. 

I have my pre-op with my surgeon Friday and I'll of course discuss my feelings with him. It's not that I don't want or need the surgery, I'm in terrible constant pain. It's not that I don't know all the possible complications, risks and such and their low probabilities. As far as risk mitigation goes, I think I'm as good as is possible and he's an amazingly well respected surgeon. It's just that I'm *scared*.  

 I've been scuba diving at night in the outer arms of a hurricane, and with great whites. I've jumped out of airplanes, climbed big walls of rock, rocketed around a racetrack on my motorcycle with my head inches from pavement whizzing by at 100+ mph. None of that scared me.

I've just completely an 8 month course at a local trade school named Everest. I went into the program and let them know right away that I had a criminal background (Nine years ago I was charged with a class B Misdemeanor, poss. of Marijuana under 2oz), but I smoothly completed everything that came with the charge and was given the paperwork to prove it.

The 8 months of in class training passed, I excelled and now it's time for my externship (160 ish hours) of training in a pharmacy. Of course, the TSBP ran my background, the charges came up and now it's been something like two weeks that I've been hounding the folks in Austin as to what I could do to speed this process along. I shipped paper work over night &amp; kept in contact, etc. Today I was told my case was being moved over to a ""legal"" team and I wouldn't be hearing from them for a while, when I asked what exactly ""a while meant"" the woman responded with ""a few months"". I'm feeling a bit discouraged at this point, to say the least.

Now my question is, can I bypass the school's need for me to go through the ""trainee"" process, go take my national certification exam and start work? Or is my ""red card"" important?",3,9,2013-12-04,PHARMA,0.03897160291671753,0.9249428510665894,0.03608560189604759

The patient was incontinent, but a fairly easy 1 person change so I was a bit curious.

""He doesn't look right but the nurse was just in here. What do you think?""

Now, when I train I tell them that we have spidey senses for a reason, and to trust those instincts. Trust but verify.

Pt was soaked from shoulders to toes, clammy sweaty headed and pretty out of it. I asked if he was diabetic and what his sugar at 9 was. 88.

I told the nurse that I was gonna recheck his sugar. He gave me crap for it, but the charge nurse told him to let me.

Sugar was 36. Trainee listened when I taught, and so did I. 

Good training and observation save more lives than most anything I think.

medicine,Anxiety and the vagal control of heart rate.,"Is there a possibility that in some cases anxiety could be caused by activation of the vagus nerve due to some internal ailment? (maybe as in some sort of internal warning system that there is organ distress of some sort). There are many studies that suggest anxiety, in the psychosomatic sense, can cause changes in vagal control of heart rate. However; what I am attempting to suggest is vice versa... what if a healthy individual who does not suffer from acute anxiety suddenly suffers from an anxiety attack of sorts leading to increased heart rate or blood pressure could this be the bodies underlying system of letting you know something is wrong internally via the vagus nerve.

""So how are your parents? Do you keep in contact?""
""They actually passed away""
""WHAT DO I SAY HERE, what happened if you don't mind me asking?""

*When should we declare someone is dead?Only if they cease to have brain activity? How long till someone that has entered cardiac/pulmonar arrest starts suffering from injuries in the Brain?

*If this is the case why do some people say stuff like sudden death when the death is not even related to neurological problems? Even if they enter cardiac/pulmonar arrest, cant that be reversible even if there is brain activity? The brain doesnt simply die right away, correct? So why the term sudden death?

Im just wondering about this because I am afraid of going to ER and have no clue what to do when im called for action.

*Imagine we have someone that entered unconscious in the ER with a Knife stuck on his brain and he is in cardiac arrest? What should I do? I dont have time to ask for a EEG to see if he has brain activity? He is unconscious so how do I know if the unconscious was derived from no brain activity? I heard that people can become unconscious from a big ""shock"". Sorry I dont know how to translate this better.

Sorry for bugging but this is my last question:Should I always focus in trying to revive a patient if there is only brain activity?

Thanks everyone and sorry for bothering you guys.",25,22,2013-12-06,PHARMA,0.13862131536006927,0.8364652395248413,0.024913400411605835

medicine,A patient pseudoseized into my arms last night.,"He was a big lad, drunk with a history of violence and complaining of pain in his arm.  Security was at the bedside.  He was being cooperative, and I wasn't feeling threatened.  

As I walk by the bedside again, after ordering x rays, he calls me over.  I go over, he gets up from a chair, and slowly steps towards me.  He is now definitely within the distance I am comfortable having a drunk man with a history of violence near me, but as I say, he was playing nice, and I didn't feel threatened.  

Then, mid sentence he topples right into me!  Completely dead weight.  Probably 250 pounds.  My ""nice guy"" instincts made me grab him by his underarms and lower him to the ground where he proceeded to have a rather poor example of a seizure, which involved his head being cushioned by his lower arm, and zero post-ictal confusion.

Now my back kind of hurts, but not too much.

Lesson learned:  Don't let people get within your personal space for any reason.  He could have struck me or worse.

Maybe next time step aside and let nature take it's course?  
If he really was having a seizure, I would have felt bad if he bashed his head on the ground.  

I did tell him after his x ray that if he fell on me again, I would step aside.

Health,"Had an odd experience at the hospital the other day. Definitely a bit concerned, a little help in dealing with this would be appreciated.","I went to the hospital the other day because of chest discomfort. I could pinpoint the location and it wouldn't be a sharp pain, just dull. But there were a couple of occasions where it did emit a pain. I finally caved after dealing with it for three weeks. It started no less than 2 weeks after I quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey. 

Because of this I've been told and thought to myself a number of things: 

- It's stress from your body quitting a substance.
- It's your lungs getting more oxygen than they're used to getting.
- Stress from working out at the gym.
- Stress from life in general; anxiety, depression.

I went to the hospital and they weren't sure what to make of my symptoms so they just wrote me down as ""heart palpitations"" to see someone. I sat in the waiting hallway for about 20 minutes before someone helped me, they left not 5 minutes later. Then someone else comes and tells me I need to go for a chest x-ray, this is where I'm extremely nervous or maybe I'm overreacting but it worries me nonetheless. One of the technicians said ""What's that?"" And the man who led me to the room asked me to retake it because it hadn't printed right. I didn't mind this but they told me later on that my blood tests came back fine but I heard absolutely nothing about the chest x-ray.

Health,Alcohol and anxiety.,"I'm not one to talk about myself. I very rarely discuss emotions or anything that's bothering me with anyone. I keep it all inside. I'm not disfunctional. I'm just finishing college and I have a pretty big family. My social life is in the gutter, but that's by choice (shitty friends). 

Anyways, I'm sitting here on reddit after having a few beers. I can't describe how different I feel now than what I feel during the day. At the moment, I have no anxiety, can easily talk to people, and insecurities that almost make me break down don't even cross my mind. I'm more confident, I don't have to smile during every conversation because I'm indifferent to what people think of me, and everything is just clearer in general. 

Honestly, I don't think anyone wants to be an alcoholic. I would love it if there were a better solution to my anxiety, but it seems like self help just doesn't get me anywhere. My insecurities follow me around everything. They wedge themselves into every conversation I have, change how I act, dress, even my interests (when I'm sober). 

Probably not fitting for /r/health ,but does anyone have some advice?

pharmacy,I'm a student working at a pharmacy and I'm so stressed.,"Throwaway here. 

So I'm a pharmacy student working a PT tech job, with no previous experience, in California. 

The pharmacy is extremely busy-- one of the busiest in the entire city. The learning curve was so high for the first few weeks I felt like an idiot. No one has extra time to answer questions, so replies are generally curt and lack any depth. It's extremely difficult to learn in this situation, but I've gotten by so far (with a few private breakdowns). I've gotten yelled at by customers, techs, and pharmacists (unprofessional of them, I know). I try my hardest not to take anything personally, but it's very hard! I know it's a stressful job with office politics running amuck, and not every pharmacy is like this, but I want to persevere. Learning to handle this can only make me a better pharmacist. 

I need some advice from pharmacists or students who know what it's like. Getting yelled at for things that aren't your fault and things that are. Also what can I do to integrate more into the team? I am thinking Christmas is around the corner and everyone likes baked goods...    

Edit: Thank you for all the replies. I think everyone here has helped me (with or without direct advice), and a lot of lurking students. I really needed all these replies to relocate my dedication and motivation. I'm going to do the following things:

Health,My husband saved my life last night.,"Last night, I was at home with my husband. Right before I went to bed, I gave myself my last shot of insulin. about twenty minutes later, I started to feel sick. I realized that my glucose levels were either too high or too low, so I went to the kitchen to find my testing kit and eat something. I sat down at the dinner table and took a drink of juice.  Long story short, my levels were tanking and I started to have my first (and last) diabetic seizure. My husband had stepped out of the room at this point and he walked in to me semi-conscious, on the floor convulsing in a pool of red (it was the juice I was drinking). From calling the ambulance, to holding me until the EMTs arrived, to speaking on my behalf about the diseases I have and my meds  - I have several autoimmune diseases so I really take about 20 different rx's a day. 

In the ER he was my advocate, my nurse and everything I could have ever needed. He spoon fed me the meal they gave me, got me to sleep when I could, and made sure that I wasn't bleeding all over the place from the 18 times the nurses tried to put in the IV. 

I came through okay, but I found out after all of this that I was minutes away from ending up in a coma. Had he not acted, and gotten me help when I needed it, I would not be typing this now.

medicine,First Year Med Student With Questions About the Future of Family Medicine,"Greetings!

I am a first year medical student and am developing a keen interest in an outstanding MD/MPH program at my medical school that tracks students into being a family physician.

I am going to apply to this program, but I have a couple questions about the future of family medicine I am hoping some of you might address.  First, what does the future look like in terms of job prospects and nature of work?  I've heard a lot of chatter about physician extenders (PAs, NPs) taking jobs of family physicians and I can see why.  At the same time, is there a possibility that family physicians can take on some tasks typically delegated to specialists (like simple dermatological procedures, etc)?  

Also, with the Affordable Care Act and other changes brewing in our health care system, will it be practical to maintain a reasonable workload in the face of increasing numbers of patients?  And financially, will family physicians face salary cuts? (I'm worried about this because of the fairly large debt I will owe combined with the fact that family physicians are already among the lowest earners of all physicians).  

I'd appreciate any advice you can provide!",54,37,2013-12-13,PHARMA,0.8230432271957397,0.15414775907993317,0.022809075191617012

pharmacy,A pregnant female was admitted to our medicine ward for liver failure. Ddx: labetalol-induced hepatitis. A little discouraged not catching it.,"I recently finished my rotation on a medicine ward. On the last day, I was on rounds with the residents/med students and we had a pregnant lady admitted for acute hepatitis. They talked about potential causes and investigations, we told them to be careful about upping her morphine too much due to her hepatic impairment, and we carried on. Looking at her home meds, she wasn't on very much, just labetalol that was started a few weeks ago for her hypertension and a prenatal multivitamin. 

Later that afternoon, I was heading down to meet my preceptor when I overheard the residents talking about a hepatology consult that mentioned labetalol being a probable cause. I didn't have time to stick around but was actively thinking about it when I met with my preceptor. I found a good article on LiverTox (http://livertox.nih.gov/Labetalol.htm) through a quick search that summarizes all the case reports that have been reported. Although pretty rare, the patient's time course fits with what's described in the article. FYI: labetalol apparently has the most concern for hepatotoxicity of the beta-blockers.

I felt kind of discouraged for not adding it to the ddx; normally, I would've done a search on my phone during rounds for this kind of thing. I remember our academic dean telling us that it is our job to rule out drugs as a cause for a patient's problem. A little disappointing that I didn't do my due diligence, I guess.

Anyway, I thought about other options we could have given our patient and decided that nifedipine was probably the way to go if an antihypertensive was still needed (hepatotoxicity relatively more of a concern with methyldopa and labetalol). I headed back to the ward and asked the residents what the update was. Turns out they already d/c'd the labetalol and started them on nifedipine as per the consult. I didn't get to make the intervention, but I was able to let them know about the hepatotoxicity concerns with other first-line antihypertensives and gave them a copy of the labetalol article I had when they asked for the resource. 

I had a lot of successful interventions while on my rotation, which was great and my experience there only confirmed that I want to go into hospital, but I guess I wanted to share this ""failure"" with pharmareddit. I don't really have a question. Maybe some words of wisdoms for a soon-to-be graduate?",16,39,2013-12-14,PHARMA,0.09768880158662796,0.8792979717254639,0.02301323227584362

Health,My dad is absolutely miserable with sciatica. I've never seen someone in so much pain! :'(,"My dad was just diagnosed with sciatica a few days ago. On Thursday I took him to the ER because he was yelling in pain, shaking and could barely move. They did an X-ray, gave him 2 pain shots and a muscle relaxer shot (I think). They then sent him home even though he was still miserable. Both of us seem to be pretty immune to pain meds if that's even possible. 

Yesterday morning, my dad work up and was *screaming* in pain, shaking again, and couldn't move so I had to call 911. They took him to the ER and they did an MRI. He received two more pain shots. They kept him for about four and a half hours and was released. He has an Rx for four meds but he isn't much better at all! He can barely move. 

The X-ray and MRI didn't show anything abnormal. 

What can I do to help him? Why aren't the pills working? (Percocet, Tramadol, Rx ibprofun 800mgs, and Baclofen)

I am taking him to see his regular Dr. on Tuesday morning if he can hold on that long. 

He had no recent falls/injuries and the only health concern he has is slightly high blood pressure. 

Thanks for reading. 

**EDIT** He woke up this morning screaming/crying in pain. (I'm not exaggerating) I had to call 911 again. They took him to the hospital and are getting him a room and are admitting him. They should have done this in the first place!


**EDIT**#2 A back specialist came to see my dad and they are doing surgery tomorrow.


.








**EDIT 3** The surgery was over three hours. My dad had severe stenosis. He'll be in the hospital a few more days then transferred to a place where he'll stay and get PT for a while.*

**EDIT 4** My Dad was in a skilled nursing center for 12 nights and is now home. It's been hell and I wouldn't wish this on anyone.

pharmacy,Tamiflu rationing,"It seems like there's a certain point every flu season where we go from well-stocked on Tamiflu to calling around to find it for patients who are sick, almost overnight. 

I've seen the walk in clinics in my area do a couple do things that are contributing to the shortage. The first is not really knowing what's wrong with the patient, so they write a script for an antibiotic, Tamiflu, and a cough medication. This annoys me because it seems like lazy prescribing on their part and occurs too often for me to think there's a legit medical need for every patient with this cocktail. 

The second is writing a script for the patient who tested positive for the flu, and then everyone who lives in the house with them. I understand the reasoning behind this one as Tamiflu is indicated for flu provention, but in reality we only have a finite supply (especially over the weekends) and it sucks to have to turn away patients who need it or make them wait a day for it to be delivered when they should be starting ASAP. 

It wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't just my pharmacy, but it seems like every pharmacy in the area runs out at the same time, and the patients who get sick late in the day or over the weekend get screwed. 

I ran into a situation last year where a family of 8 (yes, eight) all had RXs for Tamiflu, but only 1 was getting the treatment dose and the rest were preventative. It cleaned out my stock for the day and I had to turn several other actually sick people away. I really wanted to recommend that only the direct caregiver(s) get the meds and for them to isolate the sick patient from the rest. I realize it's not an ideal situation, but is it really fair to those who are actually sick for people who only may get sick to get everything we have in stock?

Any thoughts on Tamiflu rationing?

Are there any attending surgeons out there that can shed some light on what a normal month in the life of a surgeon is like? How often are you taking call and what is standard for the industry these days? Are there any work hour restrictions like those in residency?

And for those surgery residents out there, are work hour restrictions even enforced? It seems like residents are stuck in a catch 22 where if they report that they are working more than 80 hours, their program loses accreditation and they lose their jobs.

medicine,"Trauma Surgeons of Reddit, how crazy are your lives?","I'm an MSIII who is interested in general surgery and am trying to explore my options as I apply for away rotations and residency. I am attracted to the idea of trauma surgery, but I can't exactly reconcile my interest with the horrible lifestyle that I keep hear about. Namely, I hear that trauma surgeons live at the hospital and are often there for 80+ hours a week, easily. Is this your reality, or are people simply exaggerating? Also, do you see the nature of trauma surgery changing in the future, perhaps moving towards shift work or something of that nature? I'd be interested in hearing any information that anyone - surgeon or otherwise - has about the field.

EDIT: Hm. There are a lot of different responses here, and the sense that I'm getting from this thread is that the workload and case variety depends on what kind of institution you work for. In general, it seems that working for a large urban trauma center would, almost ironically, mean fewer nights of call and more shift work. I also get the idea that a lot of your work will be SICU coverage and life management of really troubled patients. Most of you guys hit the nail on the head though - I'm really attracted to the idea of trauma surgery, the thought of running into the  OR in the nick of time, and being able to (theoretically) take care of anything. I guess I'll have to see how much I actually enjoy it when I do more of my surgical rotations and electives... but thanks for the honest answers, much appreciated!",27,64,2013-12-20,PHARMA,0.029174279421567917,0.9230462908744812,0.047779399901628494

Health,"What do you think of my concept of an online doctor/patient local ""matchmaking"" service.","I am a practicing gastroenterologist. I have been watching this subreddit for a while and, of course, it is obvious that people are always looking for medical info. And doctors are always looking for new patients for their practices. But the only way to get medical info is a random web search or rely on personal impressions of unqualified strangers. 

What I envisioned is, what if a patient posts a question on the website, and then is matched through a geo-targeting algorithm to a physician in their area. They interact, the patient gets some quality (general, no online diagnosis) medical information, and the doc gets a new patient lead to nurture, possibly into a new patient visit at the office.

Health,"I've always been a moderate drinker. Suddenly, drinking even a small amount makes me feel extremely ill, as if I've been binging all night. Has this ever happened to anyone else?","I know no official medical advice can be given, but this has me perplexed. Some history -- I am a 22yo female with no major medical issues aside from a long history of stomach problems. Have always had regular stomachaches and nausea, almost every day, with no real rhyme or reason for triggers. Around age 10 I was diagnosed with IBS and acid reflux, had lesions in my esophagus and stomach; took Nexium for awhile and it cleared up my heartburn and healed the lesions. No longer on nexium and no longer suffering from the symptoms of acid reflux. But still suffering from IBS -- I usually have 3-4 stomachaches of intensity [3-7] per week; I'll have about one day of diarrhea per week; and I have an almost-constant nausea of about [2], which will jump up to [5-9] for a couple hours about once every other day.


Now I realize that alcohol certainly exacerbates IBS symptoms. But the weird thing is that it has never really bothered me much. I very rarely drink heavily. For the last year, I've had probably about 4-5 drinks per week, usually over 3-4 days. I generally have a beer or glass of wine with dinner a couple nights a week, and maybe 2 weekends per month I'll go out to the bar and have 2-3 drinks, beer and/or mixed drinks. When I do drink enough to get moderately drunk -- say, 4 beers or 2 strong mixed drinks -- I'll certainly have stomachache/nausea the next day, but it only lasts about half a day and is always normal for the level that I drank.


However, about 2 weeks ago, I had 4 beers at the bar. I was moderately drunk, as expected - a bit uncoordinated but not falling down, and not at a level where I would normally throw up. Not only did I throw up that night, but I felt abnormally ill the entire next day, well into the next night. I threw up probably 5-6 times in all, couldn't keep anything down, when I wasn't throwing up I had a stomachache of intensity [7-9] and nausea of [9-10]. For me, for four beers, this is pretty extreme.


Several days later, after I was feeling back to normal, I went out and had two beers. I normally may have had some moderate nausea for a couple hours the next morning. But again, I was doubled over in pain and extremely nauseous the entire next day. Did not throw up though.


Then tonight, I had one beer and one very small shot of Bailey's Irish cream liquor, and here I am again doubled over. Just had diarrhea and feel like I'm about to throw up. 


Just want to know if anyone else has experienced or heard of this -- suddenly developing this kind of intolerance to alcohol. I tried google but all the results I read were people who had taken a break from drinking and then took it up again, or had this develop gradually, or only from drinking beer -- none of which applies to me.


Again, I know no official medical advice, but any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated!

Health,[Please help] Mother suffers from constant bloating and constipation - not sure who else to ask.,"To start, I'm sorry if this is in the wrong sub reddit but it seems appropriate. My mother is in her 50's and, like the title says, sufferers from painful bloating and frustrating constipation. 

The bloating seems to occur after pretty much any meal. She has also seen many people and a specialist who have yet to be able to truly help her. It is sad to hear her cry because she is in pain all the time, and is almost afraid to eat anything; Even strong laxatives sometimes do not work, which is worrying. 

That being said, I really hope someone reading this knows a thing or two and might be able to point me in the right direction.

Health,Paralytic Reaction to Velvet,"Alright, I'm finally talking to someone about this. I'm not sure where to begin, so I'm just winging it. I apologize if it seems like I'm stumbling.

Ever since I was little, I've had this very...odd reaction towards velvet material. When I touch it, I become almost completely paralyzed and shake pretty badly. I can stutter out words, but my muscles twist and contort, and my hands kind of go crazy. It's incredibly painful. Seeing or imagining velvet material brings about a smaller episode, but it still happens.

I can't exactly remember when it began, but I know I've dealt with it my entire life (24 years old.) My brother also hates velvet, but he doesn't have a reaction like that. My parents and two sisters are just indifferent towards it.

Basically, I've had enough of this bullshit. Last night was almost ruined for my wife because her grandmother's house was decked out in velvet pillows, blankets, etc. I was rendered almost incoherent, and later became sick after eating due to my body constantly having those stupid fucking episodes where it would tense up like I was having a seizure or something. We were having a lot of fun, but it was always interrupted by me suddenly freezing up. When she noticed me, she would dart around the room and hiding anything with velvet on it. She knows how bad it is, but she's as lost as I am about why I have these reactions.

medicine,H1n1 wrecking havoc on my family. I just need to get this off my chest. (Houston Area),"I need to get this off my chest.  I have been stressed and thought I would share my current struggle.  I am not a medical profession or a writer, but I do have a BBA in Health Org Mgt. Mom and my sister are RNs.  I have been active in the treatment plans for my family’s current conditions.

This has been a crazy December.  First my mom (65 CAD Diabetes) completely lost her mind one night.  Walked out the front door leaving it wide open and went to the neighbor’s house completely out of it.  I came home she was diaphoretic, different sized pupils, aphasia, and shaking.  Called EMS stroke was the first thought.  She ended up being transferred to the Med Center in Houston.  Two days no talking, constant writhing and involuntary muscle movements (eyebrows included).  EEG showed abnormalities, but MRA and CT w and w/o contrast were negative.  After being in the hospital she developed a cough and bad congestion, culture came back for H1n1.  Subsequent EEGs showed no more abnormalities but the doctors put her on acyclovir.  She slowly improved day to day.  Eventual a LP was performed (on plavix so had to wait) and it showed nothing abnormal.  The nuero problems had all us thrown for a loop.  It seems odd to me, but the Infectious disease doctor put her on a double dose of Tamiflu after day five of being in the hospital.  After a week she had improved and they discharged her.  Six hours post discharge she became obtunded and had a 102.6 temp.  She ended up collapsing soon after.  Back to the ED, they got her fever down, chest film showed multifocal pneumonia.  Her WBC and BUN were pretty out of whack and low Mag. Another week of A&amp;A nebulizer treatments, levaquin and sozen drip, her conditioned improved.  Dodged the bullet. Scary last two weeks.

But wait!  So my sister, 40 obese but no known chronic disease, ICU nurse, visited mom on day three in the hospital.  She ended up contracting the H1n1 too.  Both my sister and mom had the flu shot. She took tamiflu immediately and maintained a rough cough for the duration mom was in the hospital.  She also had occasional spiking temp, malaise, and chills.  Three days after Mom was released we had to take my sister to the ED for pulmonary issues.  She couldn’t breathe, lungs sounded bad, high BP, coughing fits.  This is day 12 after she first developed symptoms.  They moved her to the ICU, o2 sat was getting into low 80s on room air, she is maintaining ~93% on 3-4 liters NC.  She is on steroids, duoneb, Rocephin and Zythromax IV.  More blood work(CBC CMP) just pulled.  WBC was elevated in the ED.  And here we are today.

TLDR: Mom lost it, neuro problems, turned out to be H1n1, developed MF Pneumonia, is recovering after 2 weeks in hospital.  Sister also caught H1n1 from Mom, day 12, admitted to ED 3 days ago, now in ICU with pulmonary issues.  I need to vent.

Health,Are there any Dermatologists in the house? Because mine is a jerk.,"I guys.
Long story short I have had ""eczema"" all my life. For the past year it has been constant. And for the past 3 months it has been getting worse than it has ever been. I saw a dermatologists in October but she was very rude with me and didn't spend more than 5 minutes with me, she didn't even sit down. Im an Army medic so I had lots of questions. I even keep a spread sheet that tracks all the meds I have used thus far and their effectiveness. I wanted to discuss light therapy and occlusive dressings. Well, she was not interested in any of that she looked at me said oh you have eczema here use this ellidel and she walked out and told the tech to give me an IM steroid. Felt less like a patient and more like an annoyance to her. 

  
Anyways. I have some questions. 

- Is it normal for eczema to affect only one side of the body more than the other. Mine is much worse on my right side. My arms, face, neck, chest, and legs are all worse on my right side. [here](http://imgur.com/a/CX3ln) are some photos.
  
- I am on Hydroxizine for the itching which I take at night. I itch in my sleep even when I take two hydroxizine doses. I wake my SO up in the middle of the night when I scratch in my sleep. Is there a stronger medication I can take?

 - Is light therapy an option? Is there a chance it would improve my skin?
  
- Are there any other options than steroid injections+steroidcream+ellidel? That is my routine currently and it is not working. Oral prednisone gives me rebound flare ups. I worked with a patient who had sever eczema a few years ago and she went to a specialty clinic and she described it as being similair to chemo. Would this be an option?
  
- And just FYI I don't use scented soaps or fabric softener. I use aveeno but it burns like heck (cetaphil burns worse). I take oatmeal baths (I get about 30 mins relief from itching) and I have tried everything from tar soap to prednisone as far as topicals. I was allergy tested 4 years ago with negative results. I have tried lactose free and gluten free diets with no results. I used a neosporin eczema product line and had an allergic reaction but they couldn't pinpoint what  in the creams caused it.

Health,Still covered under parents insurance and I need to see an Ear Nose and Throat specialist. They don't see it as a necessity. What are my options?,"BACKGROUND: Last August I had a biopsy done on one of the several larger than normal lymph nodes in my neck. The results were negative and I haven't really been concerned with my health since. However, in the past 6 months or so I have been getting night sweats and pain in the lumps when drinking alcohol, both being pretty big indicators for a more serious problem. Additionally, the lumps have grown and are now limiting the mobility in my neck. 

Problem/Question: Because I had a biopsy done my parents see any further tests as unnecessary. Considering they pay the bill, its hard to convince them otherwise. 
So, are there any other options for me, as a far as seeing a doctor to make sure everything is still okay? If no, has anyone dealt with a similar situation and have some advice on convincing my parents?",13,17,2013-12-28,PHARMA,0.12455307692289352,0.8352373838424683,0.04020952433347702
pharmacy,P1 who failed first semester. Help?,"Hey guys. So I officially failed my first semester of pharmacy school, and I feel like a complete failure. I struggled all semester long trying to adjust to the rigorous curriculum and ultimately fell short. I was failing two classes from the start, and ended up dropping one halfway through the semester to retake it in the summer. I made a C in one class, and got a big fat F in another (got As in 2 remaining classes, but they were easy busywork ones). 

I don’t know where I should go from here. I have to present my case to the dean in a couple weeks and explain why my dumb ass should even be allowed to remain in this school. I feel like it was all just stupid luck in the first place that got me here. I will say it is a top 5 public school in the United States and was very competitive to get in. What the fuck did they see in me that made them think I was capable of succeeding here? Because it sure as hell feels like I can’t. I’m not one to make up excuses as to why I failed; I accept that it was me and me alone who fucked up and take full responsibility for it.

I don’t know, I guess I’m just looking to vent and ask for advice of anyone who had to go through an academic dismissal appeal, and what I can do to make the most convincing argument as to why I should even be allowed to continue with the program.

medicine,How do I not become a jerk?,"When I started in medical school, I was surround by a field of very altruistic students, humanitarians and we all had heightened levels of empathy for our patients.  By the end of internship I was finding that the beaming, radiant humanistic physicians in training I was around were slowly becoming for lack of a better word ""jerks.""  Maybe this was happening to me as well and I wasn't aware of the degree.

I evaluated carefully what was happening to people's personalities through the duration of training and realized the time crunch was the biggest factor.  We constantly ask ourselves ""do I eat lunch or do I grief counsel this family?"" ""do I cut this patient off so that I can go to the bathroom sooner or do I allow this patient to finish his story?""  ""Do I address the psychological factors making my patient non-compliant, alleviate their anxieties or do I plow through so that I can see all my patients in a timely manner and also so I can keep from standing up my date for the evening?""

This time crunch issue really scares me because I don't know how I can practice humanistic medicine and see a new patient every 15 minutes or round on 40+ inpatients in a day.  I'm applying for positions in Pulm/Critical Care/Sleep and I'm concerned about having the breathing room of time to provide adequate care and not violating my core beliefs.

Do you have any advice for a physician looking for his first job and how to not sacrifice quality of patient care and personal lifestyle?  Any questions you suggest I should ask during the interview process to get a better idea of what the work environment is like?  Am I naive to think that a physician can see patients in a timely manner, effectively, still have time for him/herself and be profitable?
