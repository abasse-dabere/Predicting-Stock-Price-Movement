medicine,"To the Nurses, Residents, Fellows, Attendings and everyone else who make medical education enjoyable, THANK YOU!","I want to just start from the polar opposite end of the spectrum to highlight why I think it‚Äôs so important to recognize how hard so many people work to make Nurse, MD, DO, PA, PharmD, LSW education bearable.

I have on multiple occasions seen comments from residents and others that emphasize the wrong parts of medicine, some such comments I have personally received are:
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start off by clarifying what I tell all of you, you‚Äôre just a medical student, you‚Äôre not going to impress me‚Äù
‚ÄúGet out of medicine while you still can!‚Äù
‚ÄúFigure out which part of medicine you hate the least, that‚Äôs what I did, then get out ASAP‚Äù

... and a variety of other ‚Äúworst mistake of my life‚Äù type statements or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just a medical student‚Äù denigration. 

I understand that every one of these careers is difficult, that the hours are insane, that the patients can be difficult,  and the balance of it all is costly on a personal level. 

There‚Äôs no doubt you could take each of the comments above and chalk it up to that or even make a reasonable argument that they‚Äôre right. But what I came here to say is that there are also so many people I‚Äôve worked with that have interacted with students, patients and each other with upbeat attitudes, jokes and laughter when appropriate and make the best of whatever the day brings. 

This is an effort to appreciate those who took the time to recognize that they were once trainees, the lowest on the totem pole, and remembered what it was like to feel like you‚Äôre in everyone‚Äôs way. Those who realize it‚Äôs not about taking the time to teach (sure, that can be great), or even explain everything that‚Äôs happening, but take it upon themselves to make sure you feel welcome and that your presence is not overtly a burden (even if it may be). 

Nurses, Residents, Fellows, PAs, MDs, DOs, PharmDs, and LSWs of r/Medicine, on behalf of those training along side you, I want to say that everything you‚Äôve sacrificed and all the hardship that comes with these demanding careers is truly appreciated, if by no one else, than at least by us, your shadows. You‚Äôre all a testament to the human spirit, and working with and learning from you is a privilege, and I hope you know that, even when no one is saying it out loud.

I'm a soon-to-be graduate with a bachelor's in biology. I have been applying to entry level pharmaceutical/biotech positions, and have received a handful of calls back. My long term plan is to work in the industry for a few years (preferably less than a decade) and go back to school to pursue a PhD.

I looked into several certification programs, particularly those dealing with drug discovery/development.

They cost around $5k, but I'm willing to make the investment if it means long term returns such as promotions, better pay, more career options, etc. My question is, is it naive of me to think that a certificate will improve my resume enough to get me better job offers?

So, I'm new to this game I admit, but I find myself presenting patients with poor structure.   
  
I've obviously spoken to seniors, got advice, but I find myself with no real understanding.  
  
So, feel free to teach me how to get better, or a less lazy way, can I ask how you yourselves, as professionals, like to do or receive patient presentations and handovers? Anything that you think can educate me would be smashing.    
  
Thank you.

medicine,How do you combat burnout?,"I am a Hospitalist Nurse Practitioner and I've been doing this for 5.5 years. 

For some context, I LOVE my coworkers. I work in a large academic medical center which serves a large number of homeless, immigrant, uninsured patients. 

My group tends to hire about 1/2 its MD staff every 1-2 years as people who are taking a gap year before going to fellowship. The other 1/2 are career hospitalists and theres little turnover. We have about 20 MDs, and about 12 NPs and PAs. 

Like I said, I love my coworkers. It's tough to get used to working with new docs every year but I think it's awesome because they're always so helpful, ready and willing to teach, and genuinely interested in practicing medicine. We work in a team based model with NP and MD pairs for each team seeing patients. 

Despite all I'm saying, I'm feeling burned out. The volume of patients that they want us to see is higher and higher. You get an admission almost immediately for any discharge you do. The last 2 shifts I worked I did 10 admissions alone! I feel frustrated that there isnt enough time to think critically about every patient and really consider what's going on. I feel worried I will miss something important. In addition, I feel unsupported in many ways. We have no ancillary staff to help with things like filling our MRI forms, making follow up appts, faxing for records, calling pharmacies to do med recs. It's very time consuming and stressful to have to do all this ourselves. Finally, while I love the patient population I serve, I an growing increasingly weary of treating heroin withdrawal and cellulitis over and over in the same patients. Teaching diabetics over and over how to take their meds and take care of themselves only to have them represent in DKA, saying their bag got stolen and now they have no insulin (now cant get insurance to cover it either since they just filled it) 

Does anyone feel this? I love my job and hate it all at the same time. I love medicine but I feel the weight of all the BS that comes along with this and like its preventing me from giving great care. 

What do you do when you feel burned out?",17,36,2018-11-06,PHARMA,0.046604305505752563,0.9121096134185791,0.04128609597682953

pharmacy,Thinking of buying a retail pharmacy,"Good afternoon my drug stricken brethren. 

I will be graduating in a couple of months. A colleague of mine contacted me with an idea about buying a pharmacy at an affordable price, as equal partners. We live in Eastern Europe and the pharmacy is located in a very well off winter resort along with two other pharmacies. The work volume is supposed to be great in the winter months. There are 2500 people who live there during the whole year. 

My plan was to get my degree, start a post graduate degree in another country and get a job there in research, as it is non existent in my country. I've worked retail for about a year and didn't particularly like it. I think I can cope with being the owner because you have more of an entrepreneurial role. I also think that my experience with retail is lacking for such a venture but hopefully I can get past that by working harder.

The biggest advantage to this plan would be to have a business down the road that would not need much maintenance and be able to start other things. On the downside I would have to abandon any scientific ambitions I may had. I think I can live with that for the appropriate compensation. 

I'm not not sure about the point of this post, I'm mostly writing my thoughts. Any input or suggestions you might have would be greatly appreciated. 

Hope you have a great day.",29,30,2018-11-09,PHARMA,0.017952926456928253,0.8825821280479431,0.09946494549512863

medicine,Let's discuss owning and operating a practice,"I'm looking for feedback and brainstorming from others of /r/medicine who either run or own their own medical practice. 

Specifically, I am hoping to spark some discussions on various things like customer retention, marketing, general operational efficiency, etc.

To get the topic started, I'll include a few things that I've found success with for my pediatrics practice:

**Weekly Email Blast -** A weekly email blast to our customers with a short blurb on something topical. An example might be flu vaccinations, dangers of excessive heat exposure for summer sports, choking hazards for children, etc.

The goal of this email is simply to provide a little information for patients while also staying top-of-mind for them. 

**Social Media -** Regular posts on our practice's FB page linking interesting articles, stories, etc. As a pediatric office, we have the benefit of doing some more 'fun' things like dressing up for Halloween, etc. All of this type of content achieves the same thing as the email blast; we stay relevant to our patients.

**Welcome Letter -** This is a default letter that we send out to our new patients. It simply thanks them for their visit and provides them with some pertinent information (website, phone number, etc) and a refrigerator magnet with all the information.

\---

One idea that I saw that I am considering implementing is a referral program.

**Referral Letter -** A friend of mine owns a dental practice and they offer a referral bonus for any patient referrals. Whenever an existing patient refers a new patient, the existing patient receives a $10 voucher for their next visit. It's a nice way to encourage word-of-mouth referrals which are a great way to increase your customer base. 

\---

I'd love to hear any other ideas or things people have implemented with their practice that has yielded better profitability, customer feedback, etc. 

Have any of you had any success in greatly reducing expenses? If so, what areas did you find the best for expense reduction?

What other ideas or campaigns did you implement to help with business growth?

medicine,Personal Cellphones &amp; Patient Confidentiality,"I had an interesting discussion with a group of residents regarding use of personal cellphones and patient confidentiality that I wanted to extend to this subreddit.

I think that strictly speaking (say from a regulatory body perspective) the use of personal cellphones to discuss patient information is looked down upon as a potential breach of confidential information, if not an outright violation. But the reality is that that most residents and physicians do this on a regular basis. It makes work and communication efficient. There's some ways to make information less identifiable such as by using patient initials or room # instead of the name, but I've seen people communicate using full patient names, send photos, etc. We probably shouldn't, but we do.

I feel like this is something that will be heavily scrutinized (if not already in some places)... the policy surrounding confidentiality hasn't caught up with the use of technology. Even if policies exist, they aren't strongly enforced as of yet.

What are people's thoughts/opinions about this practice?

Does it matter if you are using text messaging vs encrypted services such as WhatsApp or Telegram?

What about photos of patients or X-rays/CT-scans; add to the fact that most photos nowadays are synced with cloud storage?

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2626665

**Edit#2:** Lot's of interesting discussion. I just want to highlight an excerpt from the JAMA article I linked, regarding what most would consider as de-identified, but not according to HIPAA.

&gt; HIPAA compliance can also be maintained by deidentifying information before it is transmitted. Under the Safe Harbor Method, health information is no longer linked to an individual when 18 types of patient identifiers have been removed (Box).8 This deidentified health information is no longer ‚Äúprotected,‚Äù and the Privacy and Security Rules do not apply. However, there are some limitations to deidentification. The Safe Harbor Method requires vigilance in removing all identifiers. **Moreover, physicians may not know that common derivatives of patient identifiers (eg, initials, room number) are not acceptable deidentifiers according to HIPAA.** In addition, deidentification can make it difficult to recognize which patient is being discussed and miscommunication could result.",108,139,2018-11-14,PHARMA,0.07878290861845016,0.9016512632369995,0.019565870985388756

Some folks I‚Äôve found have a pattern of doing this towards the end of the week (ex Thurs and asking for Friday off as well).

As I examine my response to these requests I‚Äôve found at first I was like ‚ÄúSure, no problem, no foul to me.‚Äù But as times gone on my thinking has shifted to the stance of ‚ÄúIll give a note stating you were at your appointment, but if you want days off you‚Äôll have to utilize your sick leave.‚Äù Now as said this is mainly for bread and butter URI stuff, for confirmed flu or pneumonia or something where public health is a concern it‚Äôs a different story.

medicine,Pediatrics Case,"Hi y'all,

I love Meddit cases, so I thought I would share one that I saw very recently. I'll admit from the very start--we don't have a final diagnosis yet, so I'm also hoping to crowd-source the smart minds here to help figure out what the hell is going on. 

**CASE**

You're in your outpatient pediatrics clinic when you get a call from the parent of one of your patients. She is an 11yoF, and today the school nurse called her parents to tell them that she was pretty tired and dizzy, and her pupils were dilated. The parents want to bring her in to clinic to have her evaluated, so you book her a slot 15 mins from now. 

She arrives to clinic and you observe a profoundly ataxic female who is requiring adult support bilaterally just to walk down the hallway. She looks very ill. She has almost no truncal stability. You get her on an exam bed and try and talk with her, and note that her mental status is altered. She can't tell you where she is or what day it is, she just keeps saying ""I'm so tired"" and ""I'm cold"". 

You call a squad to get her to the ED, and while you wait do an exam. She has a profoundly disconjugate gaze primarily in her right eye, pupils alternate between dilated and miotic. She is not tracking at all, her eyes keep looking all over the place. No nystagmus noted. She does endorse some mild photophobia but doesn't seem to recoil from your penlight at all. Her conjunctiva are maybe a bit injected. No jolt accentuation or nuchal rigidity. No lymphadenopathy. Heart and lungs sound fine. Abdomen mildly tender per the pt, but not showing objective signs of tenderness. Extremities show good cap refill, no cyanosis or deformity. 

Per the pt's mom, she had felt a little tired this AM before leaving for school, but she was otherwise totally normal. No medical history, mom denies any access to meds or drugs or chemicals. 

You get a BGL in clinic and it's 96. BP is 90/60, pulse 113, she is afebrile. 

Your attending calls the ED and tells them about the pt, and that she will need a head CT and likely an LP. He tells them he's worried about a rapidly progressive viral myelitis/encephalitis, and to have a low threshold to intubate this girl (your attending also did a peds Crit Care fellowship, so he doesn't tend to get worked up by much). Because it's a small town and you're just a med student, you ride along with the squad to the ED so that you can do her LP when she gets there and assist in her workup. 

In the bus she continues to have gaze abnormalities, but her mentation gets better. She seems to have a fluctuating level of alertness. 

In the ED, she continues to have a disconjugate gaze. She has good strength in all extremities, no pronator drift, but she does move her arms in a wave-like fashion when she closes her eyes. Heel-to-shin is normal, finger-to-nose normal. Pupils responsive at this point. 

Pt goes to the CT scanner, which is normal, and comes back. When she gets back one of the nurses says ""I think we have a case of 'being bullied.'"" You ask what she means, and she says that the patient is completely normal at this point. She's conversing normally, talking about two boys in school who were picking on her, and laughing with her mom. 

On repeat exam, she now knows where she is, but doesn't recall going to clinic at all. Her gaze is markedly better, with only mild delay in the right eye. She is able to ambulate across the room with only mild instability, balance on one foot bilaterally, and her Romburg is normal. Truncal stability WNL. She denies ingesting any foreign substances today, denies eating or drinking anything that was given to her by another kid as well.

medicine,Am open letter to our nurse (and amazing health professionals everywhere)...,"You weren't even the nurse assigned to us, but when we paged you in the early hours of the morning to ask you questions about feeding our newborn, you were the one covering our nurse's break, so in you came.

We asked you some questions about breastfeeding. My wife was concerned about getting a proper latch, how often the baby should be eating, is it supposed to hurt, and was there anything we could do about baby's fingernails, since we hadn't brought a file or clippers with us.

You were calm, reassuring, and kind. You looked to see how the baby was feeding, and you assured my wife that she was latched right. You pointed out how baby's lips were flanged out, how she had a good mouthful, and how she was taking deep and slow sucks. You reassured us that we were doing it right, and told us how to know if a latch was bad.

You came in again before your shift was over to make sure the rest of the feedings had gone well, and to let us know that you had gone ahead and called a lactation consultant to come and look things over in case we had any more questions.

What you didn't know was that we hadn't had as good fortune with baby one. She never latched right, wasn't getting enough to eat, was already underweight, and so we had to switch to formula. Through the whole ordeal, anyone we asked for help would watch her latch, say ""it looks good, and you'll know if it's a bad latch"", and then leave. It was so frustrating to not know what was wrong, and that no one would explain the situation well enough to help us. I know you guys are so very busy, but we felt so confused and over our heads.

But not you. You helped. You explained WHY it was right. You told us how to know if it was wrong. You have us to on different holds to try, how to trick baby into eating from her not-favorite breast, and you told us that pain is normal, but shouldn't be constant, and that we could expect some pain for the first couple weeks.

All of these things helped us feel WAY more informed and confident. Things weren't vague or nebulous anymore. You took the book knowledge and explained it in a practical and simple way. 

Thank you. From the bottom of our hearts (and our baby's belly), thank you. You took something that felt overwhelming and helped us find the confidence to tackle it, so far with great success. You fine folks in the medical community work ceaseless hours with hardly a word of thanks, and there's precious little I can do to change that. But thank you, each and every one of you, for the immense difference you make in the lives of others. You really are angels among humanity.

medicine,TIFU: accidentally offended a patient during a cervical check,"Hi! I would like to share a quick story today. Some of y‚Äôall might cringe and others may find this funny. Anyways I‚Äôm currently an OBGYN resident. We had this patient come in last night for an induction and her BMI is around 55. Anyways during her first exam, it was difficult but manageable and she was found to be a modest 0/0/-4. Awesome. Anyways during a cervical check later, the lights were off cause it was late. I initially had trouble finding her cervix again in the dark because her thighs (massive btw) covered up her vagina and she also had a TON of redundant tissue on her labia. I didn‚Äôt want to go diving in her thigh/general area forever so I asked the nurse to turn on the lights. Boom! 1/25/-3. Progress!

Later i find out she didn‚Äôt want me to check her anymore as she was offended I had to turn the lights on. On 1 hand I thought turning the lights on was the least awkward thing because it legit would have taken a good bit of time to feel all the way up to the opening as you had to navigate through so much tissue. On the other hand I indirectly called her fat. 

My co-residents and attending couldn‚Äôt stop laughing and told me it happens to the best of us. I guess now I‚Äôm part of a funny story that will get passed down: the boy who turned on the lights to find the vagina. Learning point was that what should I have done? The easy answer is ‚Äúget better‚Äù and yeah i agree. I felt like it‚Äôd be more awkward to dig around in there for 10 seconds or go ‚Äúhey I can‚Äôt find your vagina because of the tissue‚Äù so I thought turning on the lights was the most tactful way.

medicine,What is the most common reaction to resident suicide among attendings?,"I recently read about the Duke anesthesia program's response to a resident suicide which was to 1) blame the resident and 2) keep the attendings from participating in any resident activities. I have also read Mt. Sinai's response which was to both ignore the problem and, you guessed it, blame the dead doctor. 

I know attendings know the root cause of most resident suicides. I know programs have the choice to ease resident workloads - my friend is at an institution where one department hires a moonlighter once a week so the residents can have a whole day off. I know there is still the tendency to talk about the good old days of 120 hour work weeks and how we're all soft. 

So when one of your residents jumps off a building, how do you react?

Sadness? Desire to address underlying problems? Blame the resident? Be annoyed the resident just caused you some headache? Pile onto the other remaining residents and simultaneously blame them while making sure 8 people do the work of 9? Sit at home and wonder what you missed? Sit and home and wonder if you should have chosen a different resident during match? Self-reflection? Self-derision? Self-satisfaction?  I've joked that if I finally get up on that garage, it'll make the program look bad - there have been a number of suicides at my institution in the last few years.

I am deathly curious, pun intended. Residents grieve and blame the people in power. You, the people in power: what do you do?

Along with the 'dire-straits' articles or posts here on Reddit is usually someone (myself included) suggesting that physicians should form a union- much like nurses- to have more power in healthcare policy. 

This is typically followed by discussion about how physicians cannot unionize. From what I understand, most doctors can't be in a union because they act as independent contractors (ie, they are both the employee and the boss). 

Is there anything specific stopping a union/collective bargaining group being set up that consists of physicians accepting medicare/medicaid?

medicine,"Feeling unsupported, unhappy with program","Lately I have been feeling unhappy with my program. Most recently there was an incident where a nurse filed a formal complaint against me, basically she didn't like the tone I used when responding to her complaint. Before I get off on the wrong foot here and sound like a jerk, I am always cordial and friendly with everyone including nurses and basically anyone I interact with in the hospital. I feel like we are all working for the same goal of patient care and everyone would be a lot happier if everyone was nice to each other. 

However, you obviously can't make everyone happy and this nurse was upset with me because i didn't grovel and apologize when I heard her complaints. She used a patient to basically support her cause for a formal complaint. Of course, she left the patient name out of the complaint and the patient was not the one who initiated any complaint against me. 

This honestly didn't bother me. I understand miscommunications happen and the nurse felt the way she did and that was that. What bothers me is that my program did not support me when I told them my side of events. It is incredibly frustrating to be in residency and have seen thousands of patients and one anonymous complaint is enough for my program to question me and make me feel like I can't rely on them to support me. 

I know that program directors have to take complaints seriously. I knew that I would have to discuss the complaint with them but I did not expect for my side of events to be dismissed. If I had a pattern of complaints I would understand but I have never had an issue with patient care or with clinical staff before. 

My program directors are still in clinical practice too so I guarantee they are aware that there will always be someone that does not get along with you or like the way you do things. I've seen them encounter plenty of patients and support staff that were unhappy with them for one reason or another. 

I also want to make clear that I didn't just dismiss the complaint. Obviously, I don't want to have a negative work environment with clinical staff and want to avoid this from happening in the future. I am just incredibly frustrated with how one small anonymous complaint has been the topic of discussion for me for the past two weeks. 

Not once in my residency have I received praise for my patient care, for staying late hours to make sure I do right for patients, for being a collegial resident, for being a team player, etc. Yet in the past 2 weeks I have repeatedly been reminded how this incident looks poorly on me as a resident.

pharmacy,What drugs are the most annoying to dispense?,"Just curious what makes your list.

* **Testosterone Cyp:** This wins by a landslide for my personal bone to pick, especially the injection. Oh let me count the ways:
   * Diagnosis missing on rx, jacked up quantities, 10 ml vial ""use as directed.""
   * C3, so you run into transfer/RTS territory. WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT CAN'T BE TRANSFERRED (AGAIN)???? Good times. 
   * Comes in the dumbest how-supplied ever... either a massive 10 ml vial that would either last more than 6 months (or less than 28 days if we choose to pit the CDC/USP 797 vs DEA in celebrity deathmatch) OR 1 ml single-use vials that no one can seem to agree on the proper billing for days supply. All I want for Christmas is Test Cyp *Multi-dose* vials in the following sizes: 4, 2 and 1 ml (I can't remember if 1 ml MDVs exist b/v we only seem to get the SDVs)
   * There seems to be debate as to whether SDV can be used multiple times. IDK. I just go by what the CDC and FDA labeling say, so to me ""single dose"" means ""single dose."" But there's a good chance the pt saves the vial that has no preservative, reuses and gets an infection that is your fault.
   * If something in insurance times out, it's probably this drug or diabetes test strips
   * Supply shit....Syringe policies, getting people the right syringes/needles etc.
* **Nebs**: I've seen budesonide billed incorrectly a lot and had to call to get it fixed many a time... perhaps because 30 vials is 60 ml so tends to get billed as 60 vials instead of 30.
   * Also, medicare billing. Whyyyy.
* **Test strips**: Medicare billing, max limits, days supply,  etc.
* **REMs** drugs for obvious reasons.
* **Roxanol**: I used to work long-term care so I've seen/dispensed plenty of comfort kit type rx's. I had a hospice Rx for 20mg/ml written as 5 ml q 4 h. Thank goodness I had the nurse's direct line (she was awesome btw). Intensive properties people!!! This is why Gen Chem matters.

medicine,High blood pressure in the hospital and the role of PRN antihypertensives,"I'm only 5 months (already 5 months?!) into my intern year, but I've noticed that ""high blood pressure"" is the ubiquitous problem that's probably at every hospital in the country. I'm trying to get a QI project together about this issue.

Typical scenario:

Let's say I have a AE COPD patient with poorly controlled BP. At noon I get a page that his BP is 186/98 and that there are no PRNs ordered. This is not an isolated reading, his pressures have been in the 160s and 170s the whole time. He had an AKI on admission so his home losartan was never restarted. He's on his home 50 hydralazine TID. 

On physical exam he's pretty comfortable, no pain or discomfort really. Nothing concerning on a subsequent UA. We can pretend I wasn't terrible at fundoscopic exams and that I didn't find anything concerning on his retina or disk.

I start amlodipine 10 and make myself a reminder to check the next morning. I let the nurse know I'm not ordering any PRNs. The next morning it's still elevated, 160s/90s. So I increase his hydralazine to 100 TID. It settles down to 140s-150s rest of his admission. After that I was able to start lisinopril 20 once his AKI resolved.

- In this scenario, would you have done anything differently? (IV labetalol 10 PRN for SBP &gt; 180?)

It seems that a big reason we end up ordering these PRNs are to ""save us pages from nurses"", especially for our co-interns on night float. So the obvious next step seems to be educating the nurses making those pages. But before I can spearhead any educational initiatives I'd need to make sure that I know what I'm talking about in the first place!

Specific questions for physicians here: 

- When are short acting IV BP meds truly indicated?
- How do you handle ""high BP"" pages?

For nurses on here:

- Do you have any feedback or insight in general about high blood pressure in the hospital?

medicine,Career Chosen -- any regrets? Love-hate relationships,"MS3 here. Going through this crazy rollercoaster of med school. It's a weird feeling at this point in my life because I am spending all this money on tuition, still in school, still having my bottom handed to myself. Everything about medicine, and learning to balance the student life, it's just very challenging. 

I love it. Sometimes I think about whether I made the right choice through. My peers from school, couple of them are in medical school, some became pharmacists, MOST of them went into finance and are data scientists making ridiculous $$$, even though they're all in their 20s still. 

The thought passes, comes and goes ever so often. Did I make the right choice? I see how everyone is ""living their lives"", doing whatever they want, going on vacation wherever, whenever. It looks nice. But, I can not see myself doing anything else. I want that MD. I think it's just about taking it one day at a time, and learning to better appreciate this wonderful field.

medicine,"After 8 months and $40,000 in lost wages I'm finally in network with Aetna","Hi everyone,

I decided to make a post since this whole situation has been totally absurd. 

3 years ago I graduated residency. I started working as a hospitalist and was credentialed with Aetna at the hospital to see patients.

About 12 months ago I decided to open my own clinic. I started the credentialing process about 8 months ago with all the major insurance payers. 

Everyone except Aetna had me in network with my clinic within 60 days.

Aetna verbally and via email kept telling me that I'm good to go and that I can see patients.

I submitted in total about $40,000 worth of bills for Aetna only to get turned down as I was not in network for my clinic, only the hospital address.

Despite me having emails from a network manager saying I'm good to go to see patients for my clinic, they are denying all claims.

Today I got the news that they finally approved me to be in network for my clinic, despite me being in network for the past 3 years at a hospital location.

They have not given any good reason as to why this has been such a disaster.

I tried to argue that they should honor my previous claims and they are telling me that despite a network manager telling me in email (writing) that I'm good to go, that I never had a signed contract. And since I never had a signed contract, that I'm SOL.

So, on one hand I'm excited that I can stop seeing Aetna patients for free and starting billing to make money. On the other, my lawyer is all fired up about going after Aetna since I have clear emails that we are ""good to go"".


Going solo has been amazing except there has been some expensive lessons along the way.

If you are thinking of going solo, please wait until you have it in writing. So far I'm out a little over $40,000 in lost wages and basically gave care to over 300 Aetna patients for free.",45,245,2018-11-26,PHARMA,0.13260985910892487,0.8356083035469055,0.03178182989358902

I ask this because we have a Physician shortage in Nova Scotia in Canada where I am from, and our professional associations and government are attempting to expand the scope of practice for Pharmacists in a number of ways, including Minor Ailments prescribing, and Chronic Condition management appointments/clinics. 

Is there a Pharmacist you work with/know who you would trust to manage your hypertension patients after you've diagnosed them? What would you be comfortable with them doing? Titrating doses, changing medications (within a class vs.changing an ACE to a CCB), what about deprescribing?

A lot of plans like this are going forward here, and I wanted to get a read on what Physicians think about them. Do you see it as us stealing the easier parts of your job? Do you think we should function independently? How would you feel about having a specific Pharmacist you trust managing some of your patients, then sitting down to discuss them once the Pharmacist thinks it is actually worth consulting you about?

Even here where Im studying we have a universal healthcare which means all students train in public hospitals by publicly employed doctors. There are two big universities that teach medicine one a private ona (which pays their doctors to take students and residents) and a public one (which basically asks doctors to take residents in for free). I understand the private one not being physically able to dish out more cash to pay the doctors to take more residents but the public one could just open up more space and be done.

medicine,Asymptomatic Mediastinal Abscesses,"I'm on an island in the Pacific with little to no resources or specialists.  I have a patient who presented almost a month ago with a large plural effusion.  He had a peritonsilar abscess drained about a week before.  I placed a chest tube and got a CT which showed a large empyema and mediastinal/peritracheal abscesses.  From there it gets screwed up because the patient is undocumented and the nearest cardiothoracic program is the Philippines.  The patient is admitted and treated appropriately, but neeed immediate cardiothoracic care.  Turns out there are many hoops to jump through to get him the care he needs.  Its now been a month and we expect all of his documents to be processed this week.  Meanwhile, the organized empyema is residual, his WBC is normal, afebrile, and he's essentially symptom free (no pain, no respiratory complaints, walking around normally) despite repeat CTs showing stable/walled off mediastinal/peritracheal abscesses and a small residual organized fibrinic empyema.  In an ideal world, the guy should still be evaluated/treated by cardiothoracic surgery.  But...in the real world, he has a 5yr old US citizen son whose mother is incarcerated.  He can return since he's married to a US citizen and his child is a US citizen, but that takes at least a year.  After he's gone, the child will likely go into the foster system.  Here, thats not good.  What I'd like to know from a cardiothoracic specialist, is whether or not its imperative he be seen since he's asymptomatic.

If you haven‚Äôt heard: two days ago the scientific community was stunned with the news that a Chinese scientist, Jiankui He, had used CRISPR to modify the genomes of two baby girls. Specifically, he deleted the CCR5 gene in these girls, presumably making them resistant to HIV. This sparked a ton of controversy, as concerns were raised about the safety of the technology, whether the patients were properly consented, and whether the world had really thought through the consequences of genetic modification of the germ line.

Until now, there was lots of confusion because no one had seen the data.

But now Dr. Jiankui He presented [his controversial work](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1T1zLTtHS2z_cgl29fN_7qJg7fLA4qlrd) (link to slide deck) last night at a genome editing conference in Hong Kong.

The accompanying transcript is available [here](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/human-genome-editing-summit/2018-hong-kong/jiankui-he-human-genome-editing/).

This is an evolving story. I haven‚Äôt had time to loook closely at the slides or transcript yet. I‚Äôm curious to hear what people think. I‚Äôll try to update with my thoughts later.

My first impressions, though, on just a quick skim of the transcript is that Dr. He is a fool. His logic for knocking out CCR5 is absurd.

pharmacy,Duped by the purple drank!,"Welp. I feel betrayed.  I dispensed a partial last night on promethazine/codeine syrup, and found out this morning that it is a fraudulent script. 
After attempting to verify this rx from an urgent care, on security paper, which also included an antibiotic with the 473 mL (!) syrup rx, I was unable to reach the clinic and so opted to dispense an initial 90 mL.  
Called the clinic this morning, provider nor patient on file. Now I‚Äôm pissed. The prescriber is actually a hospitalist across town; after contacting their office, I learned that there are several prescriptions with their DEA # being filled that are not legit. 
GD ‚Äúpatient‚Äù had most of it worked out to succeed: actual security paper, a prescription that was complete but not too perfect with information, came 1/2 hour before close,  had an antibiotic on it that they also picked up, and has no issues with the partial fill.
I‚Äôm venting (TY), but I guess writing this to also illustrate that we cannot even trust security paper ffs. 
Guess I‚Äôll get to check submitting a 106 to the DEA off my nonexistent list. 
Cheers, all. 

Edit: the dillhole actually called my pharmacist on duty tonight asking if the remainder was ready! They were put on hold while I was called and then reassured that the order didn‚Äôt come in today as expected but it would be in tomorrow after 11,  (prescriber wants to press charges, so keeping the front.) I got the go ahead from my boss; hopefully gonna call the PD tomorrow!",63,50,2018-11-30,PHARMA,0.10908100008964539,0.8690178990364075,0.02190113440155983
