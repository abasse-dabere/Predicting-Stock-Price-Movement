Health,Looking for insight into a child with a severe medical condition.,"This case is already in medical hands as it is. I am not a doctor, just a friend helping to look for any straw to grasp. This is not a call for medical advice per se. However due to the quantity of unknowns and my personal desire to do SOMETHING to try and help, I am looking for anyone that might have some insight or may have come across a similar case. At the very least, having new questions to ask the doctors or new questions for the doctors themselves to ask would be at least something. If anything, I just want to see if the internet (which is largely global) might have a lead. I'm already approaching this as a dead end not to be pessimistic, but because I understand the severity of her condition and that optimism can be just as harsh to the parents.

Facts, as best as I can present them, because this is the important part:
Adopted 2yo female, about 17 pounds.
Diagnosed with Russel-Silver Syndrome.
Diagnosed with Mitochondreal disease (the severity and where it affects are unknown).
Suffers from Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome (origin unknown).

Tests have been done... EKGs, MRIs, Barium swallow test, gastric empting study, and ultrasounds. None of which show anything physically wrong. Apparently the main problem is that there is a duplicate copy of Chromosome#7.

She is on medications for energy regulation for her mitochondrial condition, to reduce stomach acid, anti seziure meds to try and control her cyclic vomiting episodes, and appetite enhancers. 

She alternates from being fine (the longest stretch has been about three weeks) to being sick for up to or around a week. And unfortunately: rinse and repeat =(

From what the parents told me, there may still be a surgical option or an injection to help regulate her functions, but at the moment, it's up in the air.

If there is any other information about this case that might help, I can try and get it. Her parents are the type of people you like to have in this world... honest-to-goodness nice people. It hurts to see not only their child suffer, but to see them in pain as well. It's weird to say it, but I kind of wish there was a god... just to have someone to blame... someone to yell at... I even get kind of shaky when I think about the girl and I apologize if it seems like I am trying to tug on heartstrings. I don't need sympathy, just any information that might lead to help.

Again, I expect very little to come of this, but it just feels wrong not to try. =(

Also, any ideas where this post might be of more use is also helpful!",14,12,2010-01-01,PHARMA,0.10643132030963898,0.8659660816192627,0.0276026614010334

It wasn't from any kind of contact, but when I was in church then I went blind for a period of time that I can't remember and it had this sensation that I experienced other times after concusions where it is similar to if you inhale water through your nose (closest comparison I can make).

http://www.fitpick.org/about.php

I work in a warehouse that also houses a vending company, and they had a pamphlet in their breakroom today about 'foods that conform to Fit Pick guidelines'.  

Pop Tarts are on the list, along with lots of other really, really bad foods.  While this might sound ridiculous to many people, these vending companies, WITH government approval, are putting stickers from this Fit Pick site/organization that say these foods are healthy choices.  

you could argue that parents should be teaching their kids that these foods are not healthy, but why are we then spending tax dollars to have government workers decide that POP TARTS are now healthy, and why do I , as a parent, have to work that much harder to explain to my kids that these foods are not healthy, even though health organizations and a list of doctors, hired by our govt, all say, impossibly, that they are healthy?

* I am deeply enamored with **the internet**, which is a major distraction.
* I'm broke and trying to figure out how to get enough money to last me throughout the semester, which is a source of stress.

Health,Barefoot Running : Shoe Suggestions,"I've been running for a long while (started at about 8 years old, 6 miles via trails with a very health conscious couple of cousins and uncles) and ever since I was a kid it's been Saucony, Nike,  etc. as my shoe selection.  Later in High School I became a sprinter (200, 400, 800) and trained in the same old shoes but ran races in spikes.



Now I'm 26 and haven't been an avid runner, I'll do a 5k here and a 5k there but I've really been more of a bike and swim guy the past handful of years.  I wear flip flops religiously and the only time I really wear shoes (I live in south Florida) is when I run.  I've been reading more and more articles (Outside Magazine, Men's Health, etc.) about the benefits of bare foot running and how it reduces a lot of the problems ones encounters as they grow older and run.  I stumbled upon this article a couple weeks ago (http://www.menshealth.com/men/fitness/motivation/longevity/article/3b4b1ca01e91c010VgnVCM10000013281eac) and decided that's it, I'm going to start running long distances again, but I'm doing it barefoot.



Now living in Miami this is a rather hazardous activity thanks to broken glass, random pieces of metal, etc. so I was looking for a decent shoe.  I've looked into the ""5 Fingers"" but I haven't heard of any other really bare foot running shoes outside of them.



I was wondering are there any bare footers on reddit?



Do you have any shoe suggestions? And why?



Any tips for getting started or common 'wives tales' to avoid?
