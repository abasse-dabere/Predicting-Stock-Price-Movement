biotech,What kind of jobs are available with a BS in Bioinformatics?,"Hi guys,
I'm currently a junior in bioinformatics at Rutgers, and I was wondering what the job market is looking like when I graduate. I have a internship now doing chem informatics software coding, and I plan to get some lab work during the winter. 

From what I understand going for masters/phD is damn near required to be successful in the field, and at the moment I don't think I want to go to school for that long. 

I do enjoy both the computer science aspect and biology of the major, but if I'm going to be stuck doing low level lab work for the rest of my life, I might have to change majors.",4.0,9,2013-08-01,PHARMA,0.07038404792547226,0.8986020088195801,0.03101392090320587

medicine,"Minimally invasive back surgery - $138,400.16; Insurance pays - $14,964.00; My responsibility - $0: How does that work?!","I recently had a laminotomy with decompression at L4/L5 and L5/S1. On my insurance company's website I looked up the charges and was astonished to find that the ""cost"" of the surgery was $138,400.16. How is that even possible?

In any case my plan discounts came to $123,436.16, so the total payout was $14,964.00, of which I owed nothing. 

The description of the $49,000 the insurance company paid a discounted price for just says:

&gt; Service Description: Services include items such as surgical personnel, room use and supplies

The $89,400.16 they didn't pay for says:

&gt; Service Description: Inpatient use of sterile medical products such as wound dressings and bandages.

&gt; Service Description: Equipment and supplies used by a hospital anesthesiologist.

&gt; Service Description: Pharmacy charges for dispensing drugs that must match a standard medical procedure or service identified on the same statement.

&gt; Service Description: Services provided under the direction of a licensed pharmacist.

&gt; Service Description: An artificial device implanted into the body, such as a heart stent (mesh to keep a blood vessel open), replacement knee or broken bone stabilizer.

&gt; Service Description: X-rays are low-dose radiation images that allow the solid structures inside the body to be viewed. The images aid or verify a diagnosis, such as a broken or dislocated bone, or the location of objects such as coins.

&gt; Service Description: Services provided in the recovery room after surgery.

Why were the $89,400.16 charges even made if they were going to be completely discounted? Does somebody get some kind of huge tax write off from that? And why charge $49,000 if it's only going to pay $14,964? And is $14,964 even a fair price for the surgery? The actual surgery part seems to have taken 2 or 3 hours, but of course I was there all day, and I'm sure all the planning involved took some hours.

Still even if people were making $500,000 per year, you could employ seven people for one day for $14,000. It seems unlikely that more than one person in the room was making that kind of money, which makes me wonder how much of it actually went to the healthcare personnel involved, and how much of it went to stockholders of the hospital.",28.0,7,2013-08-01,PHARMA,0.07422856241464615,0.9002048969268799,0.025566495954990387

Health,[Update] My mom never went to the doctor...and now I think I have it.,"[Original post: ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/1izt15/i_need_medical_advice_for_my_mom_to_either/)

It's been a couple of weeks. As far as I know, she's never mentioned her sores again. I haven't thought anything of it, until today.

So, as a 20yo I do get blackheads a lot. So I didn't think anything of this spot. However, it changed drastically in a matter of hours after removing the scab because it was swelling and the pressure is (still even) unbelievably painful. So I am asking: Did she manage to spread what she had (never diagnosed, but from what you guys said before probably MRSA) to *me*? 

I'm going to call a doctor tomorrow for an appointment. Due to my insurance the only doctor at the place I go to that is covered is only available Tuesdays and Wednesdays (so I'm going to have to wait). Until then, what can I do to keep it as unnoticeable as possible? Is it bad to continue to try and find a pustule or something to remove like my mom made me do with her? 

I have neosporin (which I've just applied) and hydrogen peroxide (I've been trying to put it on regularly but it's in my mother's room and I can't access it while she's asleep).

I just need some reassurance at this point. If she is the reason I have this, I feel like I'm going to flip shit. Oh, and since you guys were all about pics last time and I was only able to sneak [one picture](http://imgur.com/aH2DBDj) I have made sure to try and actually take pics this time, [sorry for the quality (iPhone).](http://imgur.com/a/N9CGl)

medicine,Interesting theory posed by a physician I shadowed in India. Thoughts?,"This past winter, I completed a project in southern India where I got to shadow physicians from the local hospitals as well. One thing that struck  me as interesting is that though many patients were diabetic (we were in the 'diabetes capital of India'), they were all 'normal' or 'underweight' in terms of BMI. How could this be?

One of the physicians I shadowed provided a theory of his: In Indian culture, women often eat the last and the least, saving food for the men in the family. This happens even when the woman is pregnant. However, once the baby is born and especially if it is a boy, it is fed a lot of food and grows into a relatively tall adult. For whatever reason, they stayed skinny throughout their lives.

The Dr. suggested that when a pregnant woman is undernourished, her child will have underdeveloped organs, including a pancreas. However, when the child is born, it is fed copious amounts of food so that he (especially he, in this case) will grow strong, etc. The male grows 'too large for his pancreas', effectively, and eventually the pancreas gives out in young adulthood even though he is not overweight.

I thought this was really interesting, but I could not find any information on how valid this statement is. Would anyone like to share their thoughts?",58.0,64,2013-08-03,PHARMA,0.020163483917713165,0.923642098903656,0.05619446560740471

The break was bad enough (moved 3.3cm) that I needed a plate and screws, which were put in on July 17.

Health,"So, odd question about the health of my mouth and what it could mean...","So about a month ago I started feeling a tickle in my throat. ""Ok,"" I thought, ""It's just a cold starting."" A few days later I began to notice a burning feeling at the top of my mouth, generally in the soft palate around the area of my uvula. It sort of feels like acid reflux, except it's sporadic, and isn't accompanied by heartburn or anything of the sort.

I typically wake up with it, especially if I eat a lot before bed, and after drinking some water it goes away in about 5-10 minutes. Throughout the rest of the day I can feel it coming and going, though rarely as badly as it is first thing in the morning. Right now it's more a nuisance than anything. 

Given my paranoid nature, I began to notice other things happening with my mouth. Fissures began to form on my tongue, though they have since stopped growing larger. I've also noticed the front edges and tip of my tongue are routinely red, and feature enlarged taste buds. As of yesterday, it felt like two cuts on either side, and now this morning I have one whopper of an inflamed taste bud on the right side. It's a doozy. 

I was at a dentist last week and she didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. Throat/airway looks fine, no comment on the tongue, etc. I doubt it's anything serious, but I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar.

biotech,Sitting at a crossroads - What can a Manufacturing Technician Grow into? (xpost from /r/jobs),"I recently did a final round interview at a biotech great company for a contracting Manufacturing Tech position (Bioprocess). I'm jumping the gun here, but assuming I finally get an offer here I have a dilemma that I'd like some advice on. 

Here's the deal, I went to a top-tier public school in Norcal for engineering and most my experience/background is in wet lab research - I want to pursue those either of those career paths. I know that this Manufacturing Tech position is going to be great experience in a GMP environment with arguably the top big Biotech company in the bay. But what do Manufacturing Techs grow into? What are the chances that I'll get to apply my passion in research and engineering in the future, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years down the line. Do they become engineers? Do they stay technicians? 

I also have a prospective offer coming up at an academic institution in SF which is highly appealing to me for both the experience that it offers and the research subject, but one negative thing is it is still academic and I really want to break out of academia and get a foot into the Biotech industry. 

I want to work for this biotech company enough that I am willing to take on a smaller salary and a longer commute - but are the prospects for a Manufacturing Tech what I'm looking for? I don't want to stay a Manufacturing Tech forever. 

I know I'm counting my chicks before I hatch and the worse case scenario is that I end up with zero choices, oh god. But at the moment, I'm dying for some perspective. Thanks for your advice everyone! 

Edit: Thanks for the replies! I'm a fresh graduate, a lot of your words are still foreign and intimidating but I got some really helpful (possibly reassuring?) insights from you.

pharmacy,Question for New York pharmacists.,"Ok,backstory: I don't know what other chains call it, but when a patient doesn't want a prescription but wants it in their file, it's a first fill and was returned to stock, it's a CII script that's future dated, or occasionally on some insurance rejects where we can't schedule it, it's called being put ""on hold.""

The other night it was really slow so I was going through our refill request queue and deleting old requests that had been fulfilled but still were in pending status. I always go into the customer's profile to see if maybe there was an old prescription on hold somewhere that I can just use. This one instance, we were sending a request for a birth control, and there was a 3 month supply with like, 6 refills at another store.

I call that store, a store in New York, and clearly say I'm from the same chain and if they could print the hard copy and fax it to me that'd be great. I am told that in New York, you cannot fax prescriptions. I've never come across this problem but then I ask her if my pharmacist can verbally take the prescription. She says no. Baffled, I hang up, but I have to ask you guys...

Health,"Peeing blood, discomfort. Kidney stones? Kidney disease? Kidney injury? Urinary tract infection? Help!","I'm a man, 20 years old. Long story short, back in December last year I woke up one day and couldn't really pee, about 2 days later I started peeing blood so I went to the doctor, had an urine test and they found proteins in my urine, the doctor told me I could have chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injure, or maybe kidney stones, she gave me some medicines and sent me to a kidney specialist, I also had lots of pain in my back/sides. I made some examinations such as blood test, ultrasound of my belly, chest, etc, another urine test... They found nothing, no stones, no nothing, doctor said it could have been a kidney stone that went out in my pee... But that to try to find out what really happened I should do 2 more examinations, one of them was a 24 hour urine test (peeing in a cup for a day whenever I peed) and an arterial blood gas analysis I ended up not doing those examinations because I was feeling better already.

Anyway, about 2 days ago it started again, couldn't really pee and today I peed blood... I'm scared. :(

I can't really pee, and if I try to it comes blood and I have some discomfort where my bladder is, I'm afraid I'll start feeling the horrible pains I felt the first time on my back/sides.

And I don't know when I'll be able to see a doctor. What should I do?

I'm scared!! :((

**UPDATE: August 07, 5 PM**

I went to the ER and had a blood and urine test. The urine test was scary, so much blood ([Picture [NSFL]](http://i.imgur.com/Omy76ud.jpg)), at 9 PM I went back to the hospital to get the result of my tests, doctor said I have an urinary tract infection and that she's almost sure I have kidney stones, and that the stones may have caused the infection. She said that this kind of kidney stones that comes and go (since it's like probably the 2nd time I have it) can be very serious and dangerous and need to be completely treated, and said that some people don't treat it completely and end up losing a kidney. She told me to make an appointment with an urologist, which I'll do hopefully this week, and gave me antibiotics for the infection. Since I got home yesterday I've peed probably 8 or so times, and haven't notice blood on it anymore.


**UPDATE: August 12, 4 PM** Went to the urologist today... Doctor asked me a few questions like if I smoked, if I drink alcohol, if I take any medications, etc. Then asked me to drop my pants, and pull my foreskin back, I said I couldn't because I have phimosis, and he said ""there's the problem"". (wtf?), he said I'll need a surgery (which I knew already and was planning on doing soon) and that ""I couldn't pee because of that"", but well, I don't think the problem is exactly there, it feels like the pee doesn't come out from somewhere BEFORE it gets to my foreskin. I was kind of too nervous at the time to remember about that and tell him though.

I asked him if ""So, the problem is not kidney stones?"" ""No, it's not kidney stones, the problem is the phimosis"".

Hmmm, well okay... But if the problem were just phimosis, why would there be proteins in my urine? Why did I feel pain in my back (kidneys?) in december last year? I kind of still feel pain now, but it's in my lower back, not sure if it's related though. Why would the problem start in December last year, than stop for 8 months and start again if it were just phimosis?

He asked me for a blood test and a chest x-rain, and told me to bring it to the surgeon, and have the phimosis surgery soon.

I'm feeling kind of lost now... Should I trust this doctor and just have the surgery? Should I try to see another doctor? :/",15.0,4,2013-08-06,PHARMA,0.10125917196273804,0.8693950176239014,0.02934582345187664

Health,A question about fainting or passing out...,"apologies for any and all grammatical errors in this post: typing it on a phone. 

anyway, here goes:

this morning I woke up at about 9am; it's my day off. I went downstairs, watched some television, and spoke to my mother about college (where I am returning in a few weeks) when something strange happened. 

during the conversation, in a matter of about 5 to 6 seconds, I became increasingly dizzy. I said ""woah. I feel dizzy.""  then, I woke up on the floor with my wonderful dog Kola licking my face. my mother says I was ""out"" for about 3-5 seconds. the first thing I said after waking up was ""what the hell, did I just pass out...?""  to which my mother responded with an ""oh! I thought you were kidding..."" I immediately did a self-vitals check (seeing if my left arm was numb, my chest hurt, checking my speech, etc.) I'm a trained first responder, so I knew what to look for and what to ask my mom to look for. 

all day I've been stressing about what happened. I absolutely wasn't dehydrated or malnourished, and i don't suffer from narcolepsy or epilepsy, in fact I have not been diagnosed with any chronic condition whatsoever. I've also never 'fainted' before. 

my mother is citing a recent change in barometric pressure as a possible culprit for this episode. I haven't looked up the numbers, but I'm in chicagoland if that's something worth researching. 

any other information I can give is be happy to, but everything relevant is here. I don't have time or money to see a doctor, so I'd just like some closure on this as a freak incident if that's at all possible.

I have a close friend from college that I think is slowly killing herself with food. I have tried talking to her about it, but she completely shuts down when I bring the subject of going to the gym with me, or eating healthy up. I have stopped talking about it as I don't want to make her feel bad, or poke my nose somewhere it doesn't belong, but it hurts to watch her balloon up to the point that I know it is extremely unhealthy.

Can someone give me some advice as to how to help her without upsetting her? I know it's a touchy subject, and since I'm only 140 and have never had weight issues, I'm afraid she won't listen to me or won't think I will understand.

medicine,Learning the Medicine culture as a medical student..,"I'm a 4th year medstudent, but I'm still having some trouble adjusting to the culture.  I thought I'd just share my experiences and see what people think. 

*No benefit of the doubt* - This took me a while to get used to, but it seems like my seniors assume the worst - that I'm wasting time or being otherwise unproductive.  If I'm not around or in sight for 15 minutes, I must be texting on the phone and not actually removing a patient's stitches.  I always have to tell them what I'm up to.  This is even true of things that go wrong. They will assume that it's your fault that the labs didn't get ordered unless you tell them exactly what the mix up was.

*Flattery* - Where I was before (research position), flattery can be construed as patronizing and rude.  If I was trying to suck up outside of medicine, they would assume that I was trying to get an unfair edge and it would reflect badly on me.  Not so here, and I'm so unused to that thinking here that I think it's hurt me relative to other students.  I feel so ridiculous when telling them how awesome I think their work is (feel like it should be obvious), but have to anyway.

*Email ettiquette* - short, quick emails seem to be the norm.  Long emails mean you have way too much time on your hands.

*Phone ringing* - no one cares if your phone goes off loudly in the middle of a meeting.  Well, it depends.  But if you miss a call from your senior, well...

*Going the extra mile* - If you stay later/come in earlier, it actually seems to reflect your ""lack of efficiency"" in getting work done rather than your willingness to work hard.  Even doing things that make life easier for a patient really depends on the rotation.  Wrangling a test result from an outside hospital? Great!  You talked to the patient for an extra 20 minutes to comfort her?  What's wrong with you?

*Being quiet* - you're not ""contemplative"", you're just not interested. 


It's still an adjustment, but I feel like a lot of things in medicine go against everything I've learned for 20+ years.

1. Wake up 5:15 am, shower and breakfast
2. Show up to hospital by 5:45 am
3. Sign in/out with residents from 6-6:30 am
4. Round on post-op patients till around 7:45 am aka following one of the residents as she asks the post-delivery patients how they are feeling, if they have any complaints, and to follow-up on recent labs, and future management plans, etc.
5. Report to gynecology office down the street at 8 am, saw 4 patients coming in for various issues: normal check-up, STD testing, vaginal discharge, and vaginal bleeding; I got histories on them all, reported it to my residents, and then helped with the pelvic exams/speculum exams/pap smears with my residents; wrote SOAP notes for each patient, then the resident and I presented the patient's findings to the attending, who agreed on our management and then finally met the patient himself
6.  Got lunch at hospital cafeteria  1 pm-1:30 pm with fellow med students
7. Reported to L&amp;D floor at 1:40 pm: faxed some stuff, got the history of a patient at 23 weeks here for pelvic pain, called the lab to ask when our results would come, got coffee for a resident, cleaned the ultrasound machines, helped find proper-sized gloves for a resident, got forms from a different room for a resident, observed as a resident talked to a patient about the possibility of C-section, talked with the attending who showed up for a moment about my thoughts on the rotation, helped a nurse move the phlebotomy tray, waited around for a while as nothing was going on, studied on my ipad mini

medicine,"Meddit: My heart says not to do residency, and jump ship after med school. What options are there?","Hey Meddit,

Longtime lurker, and I need your advice.

From a young age I have always had a fascination with programming/web design and startups. I taught myself some web design and was hoping to pursue those fields as careers. Due to familial pressures and my lack of a spine at the time, I went the medical route.

Through pre-med and now the beginning of the 4th year of medical school, I've tried to suppress those interests, to really, really force myself to find the beauty in medicine. I *love* the problem-solving aspect of it, but that's about it. I cannot stand patient interaction, dealing with nurses and staff, etc. It isn't for me. And medicine just does not offer the creative outlet I'm looking for. Because of that, I've managed to do web design on the side for the past few years.

So here I am with 1 year to go. I'm planning to apply for residency because why not, but I know in my heart it just isn't what I want to do. I'd much rather get into the business side of health companies, strategy or marketing, or create my own health startup. I have very basic programming skills, and am proficient in front-end development and visual/ux design, but I have no other marketable credentials, and my other skills are hardly what you'd call at an expert level. I don't want to spend 12+hrs a day in the hospital doing something I'm not enjoying, yet at times it feels as if I don't do residency, it'll be the end of the world, especially with the debt I've racked up.

What options are there for MDs that want to jump ship after medical school? Are any of you out there who found yourselves in similar situations? Anyone out there forgo residency to pursue a deeper interest?

Thanks in advance.

medicine,Wikipedia and You: How and why you should help build the worlds largest (medical) encyclopedia,"Hello all,

I am a Wikipedian I am here to try to disprove some ideas about Wikipedia for you and hopefully convince a few of you guys to help with the project.

**Why should I help?**

Wikipedia medical content is viewed by many people every day and accounts for .35% of daily internet usage (again, this is just for the medical content). This amount of traffic makes us bigger than the NIH and WebMD. [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chart_of_popularity_of_health-themed_websites_.png) This makes Wikipedia's health content a vital asset to both healthcare profesionals and lay persons alike. What also makes it a vital asset is the fact that it is free and the content can be used in any way you wish. Due to Wikipedia's popularity it needs to have a constant source of people to create, edit, and expand upon its content to make it even better. 

Editing also makes you better at helping you with your daily work or school. When I was in EMT class I was able to help expand articles and I realized that if I was able to write it I was able to remember it. Just remember to leave a citation.

**Who can help?**

Anyone! I started editing before I became an EMT and was able to help improve many medical articles. If you have an interest than you can write about it (just cite where you get your information from!).

**How exactly can I help?**

Find an article that you have some interest in and know a bit about. If you cannot choose an article look over [here](http://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;importance=Top-Class&amp;quality=C-Class). It is a list of highly important articles that are not as well written as they should be.  Look over it, form an impression of it, and looks for any errors to fix. Feel free to do what ever you want with it honestly (but remember to cite where you got the information). You do not even need an account to start editing! One suggestion I will make though it to click the ""Edit Beta"" button which will enable use of the visual editor which is MUCH easier. Have fun editing and feel free to ask any questions.

We also are looking for translators to help us convert good and featured articles into different languages which do not have such good content. The idea is that we want there to be free and open medical information regardless of where you live.

pharmacy,Correcting serum calcium,"Hi everyone!

I volunteered to do an in-service/make a protocol on how to correct serum calcium thinking that I would learn things and get to make a lasting impression on my rotation. However after reading a few references I'm pretty much still in the dark as to how you decide what the patient should receive and how much they should get.

In my mind, I was imagining you would be able to be like oh, this patient is symptomatic with a corrected serum Ca of 6, you give this much whatever. This does not seem to be the case. 

I was hoping you guys might know of a good reference which explains how to correct serum Ca levels. I've already tried DiPiro, UpToDate and the AHA guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care, Part 10.1: Life-Threatening Electrolyte Abnormalities.

Health,30/f - how worried should I be?,"Relevant: no major health concerns I'm aware of, save that I am overweight. American living in Japan, I really hate going to the doctor unless I really have to because it's difficult to deal with the language barrier.

Also relevant: I'm in the midst of a several-visit root canal procedure. Why several visits? Japanese dentists are weird. Supposedly they have cleaned out roughly 2/3rds of the root, they tossed medicine inside, closed it with some kind of putty, and scheduled me to return next week for more.

I -think- this started last week when I had my -first- appointment for the root canal but I am honestly not sure.

I've been having somewhat severe pain that comes and goes at the back of my head on the same side as the root canal. I can keep going on with things when it's throbbing, but it gets quite sharp and uncomfortable sometimes. Ibuprofen helps sometimes, sometimes not. The pain is localized at the rear edge of the bone behind my ear. Anatomical guess - it might be about where the temporal and parietal bones meet? 

It comes and goes a bit, but since my most recent dental appointment it has been present more often than not. That makes me think it's related to my tooth but as its been a little worse I've worried it might not be.

So, how likely is it I should just write this off as related to the tooth issue, or should I be more concerned?

Health,GERD + low BP + dizziness? Can't eat/drink...,"I suspect I have GERD but I haven't been tested/diagnosed. I plan to schedule an appointment with my GI tomorrow but I'm loosing faith in the doctors around here because they have completely overlooked/ignored many problems that should have been caught when I was a kid. (I'm 25, M).

**Medical History**

* Iron deficiency anemia in 2005, corrected by iron supplements (no longer taken, no longer needed)

* Diagnosed with IBD (UC/Crohn's, doctors don't know which) in 2006, but I do not have typical symptoms. Bowel movements are normal, except only once every 3-4 days.

* Just learned that I was diagnosed with gastroparesis in 2003, but the doctors have ignored it since then. 
Probably explains why I don't have frequent diarrhea as is typical of IBD. 

* Gallstones and gall bladder removed 2011. 

I was taking Asacol (mesalamine) for IBD but last year it started giving me severe chest pains so my GI switched me over to Apriso...which is just another name for the same bloody mesalamine. So instead of going through nightly heart-attacks I decided to go off medication and I have been symptom free for a year, minus this sudden onset of GERD/reflex/whateveritisnow. 

**Symptoms**

Beginning last Sunday evening, I started getting full and bloated, sometimes nauseous (no vomiting) half-way through a meal, to the point where I can't finish a meal. Sometimes I will have a burning sensation in the pit of my throat and mild difficulty swallowing. After it passes (about an hour or so) I get hungry, and the whole cycle repeats itself. It is not triggered by anything specific, as it happens with anything I consume, even water and foods that I have eaten hundreds of times in the past. 

On Thursday I started to experience mild dizziness throughout the day, with increased dizziness after eating and some mild loss of cognitive ability. On Friday I decided to start tracking my BP, which has been on the low side, with systolic ranging from 95 to 106, and diastolic from 58 to 71, heart rate between 65 and 75. Typical reading now is 106/68 at 68bpm. Last time I went to the doctor (July 31) I was much closer to 120/80 and felt perfectly fine. 

Yesterday at lunch, as soon as I put my fork down I became so dizzy I felt like I wasn't even in my body any more. Afterwards I was extremely tired and just wanted to sleep, which felt like anemia all over again so I decided to go to the ER. The IV and blood test crashed my BP so hard I went completely blind and I couldn't feel my arms or legs for a few minutes (reportedly it bottomed out at 60/30). 

* No fever
* Blood test came back normal. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood sugar all normal, no signs of infection or anything.
* CT scan with contrast showed everything normal except my gastroparesis. 

All they could do was give me stool softener and Protonix for reflux, and tell me to talk with my GI ASAP. 

Today I'm slightly better, still tired, still can't eat/drink much, and I suddenly developed neck stiffness and tightness in my throat this afternoon. I'm really lost, confused, and annoyed right now. 

**TL;DR**

* bloating/fullness/nausea after eating small amounts of food/water
* mild burning in back of throat (occasional)
* low BP/heart rate
* tired, dizzy, stupid
* tightness in throat
* stiff neck",15.0,7,2013-08-18,PHARMA,0.13265106081962585,0.8388484716415405,0.028500452637672424

Health,"Have some insect bites, bad reaction, went to the hospital. Can you identify what insect it might've been? more info in comments","I know I was bitten on Friday, last week. I was sitting on a paved balcony, so you would usually see any large insects, but I didn't see nor feel the bite. I did however notice the area was itchy, and figured it must have been a mosquito as there are plenty in the region (Friuli, Italy).

I didn't think too much of it, till I noticed it began to swell. Sunday it got so bad that I went to the A&amp;E and they gave me a steroid and antibacterial cream to apply three times a day (Gentamicina e Betametasone, 0.1% + 0.1%). I asked what it could have been, and the doctor replied it might have been a spider, but that it definitely was not a wasp. Could you possibly identify the bite? If the cream doesn't work, I will have to go back to the hospital as it's still quite sore when I move my ankle.

Health,Is ICL surgery to correct vision as good as it seems?,"I am scheduled to get ICLs inserted into both eyes next week, and I was hoping someone who has had this type of procedure done before could give me some feedback as to whether or not they thought it was worth it.

Some background:

I am not a candidate for laser eye surgery to fully correct my vision as I am too nearsighted (in short, my prescription is -11.00 for my left eye and -9.50 for my right eye). Although my corneas are plenty healthy and thick, they just can't shave away enough cornea to correct the vision. I do have a slight stigmatism in my left eye which I may want to correct later with Lasik, but I went long enough without contacts or glasses that didn't correct the stigmatism and I didn't mind it. I am a 25yo female and when my corneas were measured today, I was told 12.2 for either eye (making them larger than most people's).

The pros that I've heard: 

1. Reversable - if I hate it I can just get them taken out 

2. Won't dry my eyes out like Lasik can 

3. The end result is more clear than Lasik provides


The cons that I've considered:

1. Twice as expensive (and I don't make a whole heck of a lot of money)
2. It'll possibly put me at greater risk of glaucoma (I don't know if this is true or not)
3. I'll have visible holes near the tops of my corneas (I don't really mind, I just want to know if people who have it say they get asked all the time)
4. And, it just seems kinda scary...They're going to put holes in my eyeballs and slide in a hard(ish) silicone lens!



So, if there is anyone who has had this procedure done and could tell me what they experienced/currently think of the ICLs, I would really appreciate hearing from you!",8.0,9,2013-08-20,PHARMA,0.03967006877064705,0.9205247759819031,0.03980512171983719

pharmacy,Should Technician's be allowed to use PGD's,"Saw this today on Chemist and Druggist. 
How'd you feel about this?

http://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/news-content/-/article_display_list/16144858/technicians-hit-back-over-pharmacist-pgd-snub

Pharmacy technicians have hit back at pharmacists' rejection of a proposal to allow them to supply medicines under patient group directions (PGDs).
The Association of Pharmaceutical Technicians (APTUK) said there was ""strong evidence"" technicians could deliver safe services under a PGD if supported correctly, in response to a PDA poll showing that 96 per cent of pharmacists were against adding technicians to the list of health professionals who can operate under the scheme.
Almost 60 per cent of the 1,300 community pharmacists who responded to the Pharmacists Defence Association (PDA) poll in July cited technicians' lack of an appropriate professional relationship or accountability as the reason why they should not be added to the list.
APTUK claims that pharmacy technicians are 'fully accountable' health professionals, despite the concerns of pharmacists However, the APTUK said last week (August 16) that pharmacy technicians were ""fully accountable"" as health professionals.
""Pharmacy technicians have demonstrated in a number of settings that, given the opportunity, they are perfectly able to have a proper and effective professional relationship with patients and other healthcare professionals,"" APTUK said.
APTUK also rejected concerns that adding technicians to the list would blur their role with pharmacists and that a lack of training would render the service ineffective.
However, any new role for technicians should be the subject of ""rigorous risk assessment and risk management process"", the group stressed. It also noted that there may be some PGDs that technicians could not be included in.
The process of developing PGDs would ensure technicians would require appropriate training before they were able to operate under them, APTUK said.
""Similar concerns were raised at the prospect of pharmacy technicians taking on financial accuracy checking and patient-facing medicines management roles. All of these concerns proved unfounded with no negative impact on patient safety,"" it added.
Pharmacy technician Benjamin Leon D'Montigny said he was disappointed by the ""overwhelmingly negative"" response by pharmacists, but accepted there were some valid concerns.
""Give technicians the opportunity to prove themselves to the pharmacists we help. If you as pharmacist are not comfortable personally with your technician using a PGD, then you have control to say no,"" he posted on the C+D website earlier this month.
The PDA said it stood by the concerns raised by its members. ""Our members have spoken and we stand by our statistics,"" PDA director John Murphy told C+D on Monday (August 19).
The Guild of Healthcare Pharmacists (GHP) used its response to draft Nice guidance on PGDs to call for pharmacy technicians to be added to the list of healthcare professionals who can supply medicines under PGDs. The PDA ran the poll to see how many pharmacists agreed with this view, PDA chairman Mark Koziol told C+D in June.",28.0,8,2013-08-21,PHARMA,0.07727903872728348,0.8909939527511597,0.031727053225040436

Health,My sister is suffering from chronic stomach pain and my family has no idea what to do,"Since this January, my 15-year-old sister has had stomach problems. Every time she eats (no matter how much or what kind of food she eats), her stomach begins hurting. She describes it as a sort of bloated feeling. For a while, she tried to ignore it, hoping it would go away, but... well, it hasn't. She's lost 20 pounds, it's getting worse, and nothing we've tried to stop it has helped much or at all.

She has no other symptoms. No vomiting, diarrhea, or anything like that. Just the stomach pain.

My parents have taken her to a specialist, and a gastroendoscopy has been performed. The specialist gave her a prescription for Omeprazole, which didn't help much (although apparently her symptoms are worse when she doesn't take it). She's going to another specialist soon. She's been diagnosed with ""acute gastroenteritis,"" which is broad, uninformative, and doesn't really offer treatment options.

All of this was bearable during summer, since she could mostly ignore it and remain mostly stationary. Now that the school year has started, though, she's in trouble. The pain is distracting her from her classes and the hunger isn't much fun for her either. My parents are considering finding some way to homeschool her or looking for other options, but obviously that would be a last resort.

So... frankly, I'm terrified for her. She's still functional, but she's having a lot of trouble and I hate seeing her like this. My family is getting desperate.

Health,"Brain Functioning: I feel like I am getting slower and dumber, how can I reverse this?","I am a 29/m.  I used to have a pretty good vocabulary, and I always felt like I was able to somewhat easily verbalize whatever I had to say.  Over the past two years though, I honestly feel like my mental sharpness has dropped.  I am forgetting things more, names and past experiences are tougher to recall by myself (If I don't have anyone to say, ""remember the time..."" to me).  I have to think more about what I say and take my time, or I will end up stammering.  I feel like this is affecting my work and personal life as I can't spend time thinking about little things like this.  I feel like I am going to buried in reminder notes at some point, or look like a fool in front of customers!

I'd like to point out that when I noticed this slowdown, I picked up a hobby that I fell out of thanks to work time...reading!  Not sure if it really worked, but I felt that reading did help me to an extent.  Then I got a new job, and all of that free time when out the window so grabbing a book is harder than it used to be.

I also feel like overall, I have never been the fastest thinker when it comes to conversational responses.  This is CRUSHING me in dating and relationships.  I had a GF and if we argued, I could never think of anything to respond to her issues quickly (as in during the argument itself) so I would stay silent.

Health,"Vertebral Hemangioma, after radiotherapy treatment, pain is coming back, I need to know more about this (pics inside)","Hey guys, I'm facing this problem for about 5 years.

A vertebral hemangioma was discovered on my L1,L2 and L3 vertebra, predominantly on L2. 

Back then, I felt almost nothing (a bit of numbness when I curved my back and not much more).

At the end of last year I began feeling much more pain. I couldn't run because the impact of my feet was very painful, I felt every bump while driving and even looking back was very very painful.

During the month of April I did a radiotherapy treatment. After that, the pain was gone.

Two days ago I started feeling a little bit of pain while walking a bit faster. I'm really scared to see the pain I used to feel coming back. Back then even sneezing was unbearable.

Also, I'm worried I have to do more radiotherapy treatments due to long term side effects.

The doctors are always very brief so I do not know much of what to expect and I don't know much about this.

If anyone could explain this better to me and what could happen, I would be very grateful.

Health,"""Fast Forward"" episodes?","I've been having what I call ""fast forward"" episodes for as long as I can remember. These episodes last between 3 or 4 minutes at a time and I only know this because my neurologist told me to try timing them. I only have these episodes maybe once a month. 

I will try my best to describe them to you; it feels as if everything I am doing is happening faster than it really is. If I am typing it feels as if I am typing unnecessarily fast. If I am talking, it feels like I am talking fast. Same as if I am walking, eating, etc. I have memories from when I was young enough to be babysat of asking my babysitter ""Does it look like I'm moving really fast? Cause it feels like I am!"" 

I just recently decided I wanted to try and figure out what was going on so I spoke with my family doctor and he referred me to a neurologist.

They said it could have to do with my migraines that I have had for a few years now. But this didn't make sense to me because the ""fast forward"" episodes have been occurring way longer than the migraines. 

He decided to send me for an EEG and an MRI. I went for the EEG a few months ago and haven't heard anything back yet. I didn't have an episode during the scan. I have yet to go for the MRI which is scheduled for the middle of September.

Health,Wife Has Sarcoidosis,"After going through chronic chest pain all through her pregnancy, my wife finally had a CT scan and biopsy done earlier this year. What they found were inflamed lymph nodes and granulomas in and on her lungs and near her heart. The illness is called sarcoidosis and it is where your body's immune system becomes overactive and doesn't know what to attack so it attacks random organs in your body.

So my wife's sarcoidosis attacks her lungs (and possibly heart). She had several grueling and lengthy bouts of pain each day and takes acetametaphine codine for the pain. The pain is so intense she tells me she would rather give birth.

The doctors around here just try to prescribe her anti-depressants for some reason, but she has an anxiety disorder and we avoid taking any medicine for it since all of the many types we have taken have made it worse. Also, we have no idea why the heck they would prescribe her happy pills for this illness.

We don't really know where to go next. I have a somewhat low income and lots of debt from hospital bills, college, etc. and am trying to afford health insurance but it is very expensive. I am currently trying to get her her own individual health insurance since the family ones are so expensive and the application is in the works.

The problem is that I don't know where to go *and* I don't know if I can afford to make a wrong choice. Some people say that sarcoidosis is fatal 25% of the time while others say less than 5% of the time. That and her pain is so severe that she can hardly get up and take care of our two kids throughout the day let alone clean or anything.

I want to get her the right care and soon. I'm thinking once her insurance goes through that i will take her to a dietary nutritionist to see if she is deficient in any vitamins or other vital nutrients to see if that helps. The problem is that there is really no 'treatment' for sarcoidosis. You just take pain meds and cross your fingers that it goes away some time this year. They *can* prescribe steroids but they create terrible hormonal imbalances and with my wife's anxiety I don't know if our marriage can handle that.

There is a sarcoidosis center for treatment and such in Cleveland. I live in Alaska though and for my wife to spend a weekend there by herself it would be at least $1,200 for the whole trip, not including medical expenses.

Anyway, I'm running out of ideas and my wife is miserable. The doctors here don't know anything and are talking about taking her off pain meds. I have to figure something out but don't know what to do. Does anyone on here have any idea? Does anyone here have any experience with sarcoidosis?",10.0,5,2013-08-26,PHARMA,0.11586332321166992,0.860673189163208,0.023463547229766846

Health,Recovering from starvation [long post],"This is a long post so please bear with me. 

I am a male, at 172 cm tall and weighing 72 kg (approx. 140 lbs I am guessing). 

When I was 14 years old, I was a little shorter and weighed much more, somewhere in the 90 kg range. For some stupid ass reason I decided to lose weight fast by starving myself AND exercising by jogging an hour everyday. I literally starved myself, eating a very small bowl of cereal and a very small meal of whatever my mother was cooking - I think I had some sort of eating disorder. 

In the space of 3 - 4 months my weight dropped down to 50 kg - so that is 40 kg lost. Nevertheless I carried on until I could do it no more. 

Now of course I am normal, I eat healthily and as you can see of what I have written above I regained most of the weight. But I have very bad muscle fatigue problems. At first they thought it was anaemia, and I certainly had it. So I improved my diet and took iron pills too. I am also aware of the importance of Vitamin B12, folates and so on so I include iron in my diet as well (red meats, leafy green vegetables - I also avoid caffeine with meals as it disrupts absorption). 

According to blood tests I am no loner anaemic, and they can find nothing else that is abnormal. 

But I still get muscle fatigue issues, ESPECIALLY in my left leg and arms, here are the symptoms:

1. My hands and extremities are much much colder than the rest of my body. 

2. Exerting myself (jogging) quickly introduces a burning lactic acid sensation, a stitch in my side and pain in my chest. I also get shortness of breath very quickly. 

3. However, once I get warmed up I kind of get there and it kind of goes. This has been especially noticeable with sports like kick boxing where I somehow still manage to outlast opponents because of my stamina, which I find weird. My coach said that he could tell I run because of my stamina - even though when I am NOT in kick boxing and just jogging it totally takes it out of me. Even when doing long shifts as a waiter for example, after the shift when I run after the bus my legs burn so much and my breath goes short so quickly that it becomes a battle of will.

4. After doing an intense sport like kick boxing - for the few (3 or so) couple of days I feel very very weak. Going up the stairs introduces the burning, weak muscle sensation in my legs again and my heart rate shoots up. Especially in the mornings. 

What I want to ask is - is there anything else that one has to do to recover from such a physically traumatic event of prolonged starvation and exertion - self inflicted or otherwise? Do I need to retrain my muscles or what? 

TL;DR - starved myself and exercised a long time ago to lose weight. Now in good health with good diet but still suffer from fatigue problems. I don't have aneamia or any other abnormalities in the blood according to a few tests.",6.0,9,2013-08-27,PHARMA,0.0652928426861763,0.9044063091278076,0.03030087985098362

I don't know much about other countries healthcare (I'm in the UK) so this may not apply to you.
Off we go.


- Don't do the whole 'Oh, while I'm here, could you have a quick look at...' No. No. No. Your appointment is for the problem you described to the receptionist. If you have multiple issues, run it by the front desk and they will decide whether or not it warrants a second appointment. For example, if you broke your toe, you probably don't need much extra time. If you regularly bleed from your armpits you may need another appointment for tests, etc.


- Try not to be late. If you're 2 minutes late, and your appointment overruns by 2 minutes, the next person will be 4 minutes late. This sets off a chain reaction and you will fuck up everyones day. If you are running late or you can no longer make your appointment, phone the Doctors surgery at your earliest convenience so they can fill the empty slot.


- Equally, understand that others may be late and it's not your Docs fault if you have to wait an extra ten or twenty minutes. Don't throw a strop and demand a written apology, just grab a magazine and wait, or rearrange if you need to be somewhere.



- Be prepared. If you have an appointment cos somethings growing out the end of your dick, be aware that you will probably need to wack the little fella out. The Doc does not have time to wait while you pluck up the courage to rock out with your cock out.



- Know that you may not take priority. If someone walks in with a gaping head wound and you're sitting there with the sniffles, you will be asked to wait. Don't strut around demanding to be seen, the Doc has a duty of care and will prioritise those who are most at risk.



- Tell the truth. If you smoke, even if its once or twice a month, or only when you go out clubbing, they need to know. If you drink, whether its vodka for breakfast or a glass of wine at special events, tell them. And most importantly, if you do any form of recreational drugs it is vital that you inform your Doctor. You will not get in any trouble, whatever you tell your Doc is confidential unless someone is in serious danger. Some medicine can have negative reactions to cigarettes, alcohol or drugs and it really isn't worth the risk.



- Don't be an asshole. No inappropriate comments, for example
*'Alright sir, please strip from the waist down so I can take a look.'*
*'That's what she said, ha!*
I guarantee they will not find it as funny as you do. No hitting on male or female Nurses or Doctors, don't even attempt to tell them how you've always found the uniform sexy. 



So, I think that's all I've got. Hopefully I can help a few people and make a few Doctors a bit happier.

Health,I [16/M] have some questions about colon cancer.,"I am a 16 year old male and my family (on my father's side) has a very strong chance for getting colon cancer because it's hereditary. My grandfather (he got it when he was 43) died from it and my father had it (he got it when he was 31) when he died (not the cause of death). I myself am a cross country runner, drink a lot of water, and each much much healthier than the large majority or kids my age. For the past month or so I have been getting extremely fatigued from running and getting cramps all over my belly. My 5K time used to be 18:36. Now, even though I run everyday, I am up to to about 29 minutes. I have also noticed changes in my stool lately. They are extremely thin (sort of like a pencil) and after I finish my poop I have to go back in 2 or 3 more times at about 15 minute intervals because it doesn't empty out all the way. Many times I won't poop at all because I will be constipated. The stool also floats.

Should I go to a doctor? My mother always calls me a hypochondriac but it should also be noted that every time I complain there's something wrong with me it turns out that it is. Broken hand, took her 2 weeks to take me and they had to put me in surgery because it healed incredibly wrong. Flat arches, as a runner this is awful and my mother refused to do anything about it so my coach bought me new running shoes with arch supports(they work great!). The last example I'll give is pneumonia. I had a temperature of 103. She was just tell me to take some aspirin or ibuprofen and it would go down then an hour later it would shoot right back up, higher and higher every time. She wouldn't take me to the hospital until I passed out while crawling to my room because she wouldn't help me.",14.0,8,2013-08-30,PHARMA,0.1888684183359146,0.7664999961853027,0.04463164135813713

Health,Why is my hair falling out THIS much?,"So, I have very thick long-ish hair that regularly falls out/malts more than the average persons does. 

This is not a new thing, my parents constantly complain about my hair being everywhere, on peoples clothes, bedsheets etc. 
If i've been in your house for more 5 minutes, you're gonna know about it.  I would not be a good murderer. Too much DNA. 

Anyway, It's never been that much of a big deal, just something little they go on about me once and awhile as if I can do anything to stop it.  Lately however, it's got a lot worse. I honestly don't know how i'm not bald or have sections of hair missing. 
If Its a day when I wash my hair, this is what comes out of it...http://i.imgur.com/ugCO8Ux.jpg (excuse gross pic)

And thats not even for the whole day. 
By the end of the week I could probably make a decent sized wig out of it all.

So does anyone know why my hair falls out so much? And what I can do to stop it as i'd actually like to keep some of it on my head.

Thanks in advance.

I've currently into my second year of med school. Having alot of fun but having problems with books. Teachers give us alot of references in different books (Harrison, Goldman's cecil, etc) and I can't afford to buy 2-3-4 expensive books like those, because mandatory books are already digging into my pockets.

I tried downloading them online but torrents or filesharing site don't seem to have it available in their database. So my question is would any of you have working links to download the books or would be able to let me download from your dropbox/mediafire account the pdf of those books. Would greatly facilitate my life right now!
