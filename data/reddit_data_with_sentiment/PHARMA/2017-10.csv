pharmacy,Why on earth are diabetic supplies in multiples of #25?,"For quantity 300 test strips. Sig: test TID = 100 day supply.

medicine,Hey Doctors (especially Residents!). In the ICU what info do you want your RT's to share with you?,"Hello everybody!


RT here. So I have just secured a full time position with a new hospital. Its a county trauma center located in an are that's very, lets say economically depressed. Fairly small but they do have IM, FM, and gen surg residencies. They have no intensivists, RT solely does *all* intubations (premies, neonates, adults, trauma, etc.) outside of the adult OR, where anesthesia can intubate if they want. All vent management and weaning is done independently by RT as well. The ICU's are open, and swarming with the residents from each service. From what I've gathered, the residents aren't necessarily on ""ICU rotation"", so much as they often end up in the ICU as they continue to follow and manage their patients who find themselves admitted to the ICU.


Now, I've never worked in a hospital without intensivist attendings, so this environment is a bit new to me. 


My questions is - imagine RT was semi-independently managing your patients vent and airway, how often would you prefer to have updates on your patients respiratory status? What information do you want to/need to know? And given the set-up ICU rounds are obviously extremely important, so what information would you want your RT's to have prepared for you each day? Anything else I might have missed that you'd like to mention please feel free. I consider good communication and relationships between RT's and physicians to be paramount to timely and safe patient care, so I really want to make sure that once I start I'll be communicating everything with the docs that they'll need to manage our patients well without issue.

pharmacy,What's being a pharmacist in a rural hospital like?,I am starting to look into pharmacist positions in rural hospital settings on the west coast of the US since I've been having difficult finding work opportunities otherwise. I've heard that there can be a lot more clinical and patient interaction involved than in a larger hospital setting. I've also never lived in a rural area before either.

pharmacy,make no mistake,"To all current pharmacists, 

How do you guys deal with not making mistakes?
I feel really scared that once I become a pharmacist, I might make a mistake that will not only cost my job, but someone's life. Is it okay to feel like this? Or am I not fit to become a pharmacist?

Also, once a mistake is made, how do you pharmacists deal with it?

At my college they make us take a class that is similar to something like introduction to pharmacy, and the professor was going off about how this job requires you to be super careful and that there is no room for mistakes. He also told us a story about a pharmacist that actually made a mistake with dosing?? and ended up killing a patient and is no longer able to practice (and maybe in jail if i recall correctly). This really scared me and made me unsure how I feel about practicing pharmacy. 

Are you guy's under this constant pressure of making no mistakes and double triple quadruple checking everything?? 
Do you have any stories where you or someone like your tech made a mistake? What ended up happening? 

I would love to hear some insight from your perspectives!",13,19.0,2017-10-01,PHARMA,0.09433142840862274,0.8768261671066284,0.02884240448474884
medicine,A cranky hospitalist's top 100 pet peeves in inpatient medicine,"Feeling a little crispy after 6 straight weeks on inpatient wards, I decided to share my top 100 pet peeves, almost all of which came up during this month and a half. Feel free to agree or disagree, or to add your own.

(For the record, I certainly don’t claim to deliver perfect patient care, and have been guilty of committing more than a few of these myself!  Categorization into fields isn’t meant to imply that specialists in each field are the primary culprits.)



**Cardiology**

* Admitting a patient for “r/o MI”, and not mentioning their ECG in the admission H&amp;P (bonus annoyance points for instead documenting “ECG: NSR”).

* Reflexively checking BID electrolytes in every patient on diuretics (sometimes appropriate, but often not necessary)

* Reflexively repleting every patient’s K&gt;4 and Mg&gt;2. (How did this practice become ubiquitous?)

* Reflexively checking a troponin in response to a brief episode of asymptomatic NSVT (bonus annoyance points if the ordering doc doesn’t bother with a follow-up troponin)

* CT surgeons, anesthesiologists, or emergency med docs who cannot reliably interpret an ECG.

* Fluid restricting patients with heart failure exacerbations. (it’s sodium restriction that’s helpful)

* Placing a patient on two hemodynamic drugs simultaneously which have directly antagonizing effects. (e.g. midodrine and hydralazine, dopamine and metoprolol, etc…)

* Describing a patient as “preload-dependent” because of [aortic stenosis/pulmonary hypertension/ diastolic dysfunction/etc…] (all patients are preload-dependent!)

* Micromanaging the blood pressure in a patient with no other cardiovascular disease (e.g. orders for prn hydralazine for SBP&gt;160).

* Continuing statins in hospice patients.

* Placing a patient on a low fat “cardiac diet” because of a history of CAD. (hospital food is already bad tasting enough!)

* Assuming a patient with an irregular pulse has a-fib without checking an ECG.

* Stating that a patient can’t have tamponade because he/she isn’t hypotensive.



**Pulmonology**

* Admitting a patient for pneumonia, and not mentioning the CXR in the admission H&amp;P.

* Admitting a patient for any pulmonary complaint, and relying on the formal interpretation of the CXR without even looking at it oneself.

* Assuming that a patient with a chronic cough and strong smoking history must have COPD.

* Diagnosing pneumonia based solely on CXR findings, irrespective of the presence or absence of consistent symptoms/signs/lab tests.

* Stating that a patient can’t have a PE because he/she isn’t hypoxemic.



**Critical Care**

* “Renal dose dopamine” (yes, our hospital still has docs who insist on this!)

* Using the heart rate as a primary indicator of volume status.

* Reflexively giving Lasix to every patient with pulmonary edema.

* When there is no room for your sick medicine patient to move to the ICU because the CT surgeons refuse to transfer out their post-op CABG patients who have been stable for days.

* When your patient codes, and no one gets around to informing you until hours later.



**Renal/Fluids**

* When a patient with mild hyperkalemia and no ECG changes is given the full smorgasbord of hyperkalemia treatment - calcium, insulin + glucose, bicarb, albuterol, and tons and tons of kayexalate. (bonus annoyance points if no one even checked for ECG changes before ordering all of that)

* Conflation of “prerenal AKI” with dehydration. (AKI from heart failure is “prerenal” too!)

* Not checking a UA in patients with AKI.

* Giving sodium bicarb for a moderate metabolic acidosis.

* Reporting the results of a UA as “dirty”.

* Placing a patient on overnight IVF when they are NPO from midnight for a procedure scheduled for 8am.



**GI**

* Ordering a stool guauic for a patient whose stool is visibly bloody or melenic. (bonus annoyance points if the intern is only checking it because the GI fellow insisted).

* Ordering a PPI for a soft reason, which will likely be continued for years before another doctor reexamines whether it’s appropriate.



**Endocrine**

* Placing an insulin-dependent diabetic on only a sliding scale.

* Continuing qid finger sticks for weeks in chronic patients whose diabetes is controlled well enough to never require insulin.

* Deciding against the use of metformin in a patient solely because his/her creatinine is 1.6 - and above a traditional, arbitrary, and evidence-free cutoff of 1.5. (bonus annoyance points if the doc actually wants to prescribe it, but the pharmacist declines to approve the order.)

* Checking TSHs in critically ill patients (exception: the very rare patients whose critical illness could be predominantly due to thyroid disease)

* Seeing a diabetic food tray full of non-diabetic-friendly food. (bonus annoyance points if it includes an Oreo brownie)



**Rheum**

* Confirming or refuting a diagnosis of gout in a patient with a hot, swollen joint using a serum uric acid level instead of arthrocentesis.

* Ordering 25 different autoantibodies in a patient presenting with a vague, multisystem disease “just to be sure it’s not autoimmune”. (bonus annoyance points if a 1:40 ANA then prompts a formal rheum consult)



**Hematology/Oncology**

* When an oncologist declines to consult on a patient with suspected malignancy until the malignancy is confirmed via pathology.

* When a proceduralist/surgeon requires a patient’s INR to be below some low and arbitrary threshold prior to a procedure (bonus annoyance points when they express no interest in the patient’s bleeding history – a much better predictor of bleeding risk).

* Reflexively transfusing at an arbitrary hemoglobin, irrespective of symptoms or other medical problems.

* Using a higher-than-normal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion simply because a patient has a history of CAD. (it’s *active* ischemia that should be a reason to transfuse to higher Hb goals)

* Diuresing an anemic patient for the primary purpose of hemoconcentration.



**ID**

* Daily ESRs or CRPs

* Feeling obligated to switch to PO antibiotics for 1 day prior to discharge, to make sure the patient’s infection doesn’t worsen due to narrowed coverage or poor absorption. (It will take longer than a day for the infection to worsen to a point that you’ll be able to observe.)

* Insistence on always using the same temperature cutoff as constituting a “fever”, and reacting to every “fever” in the same way. (i.e. sending blood cultures on every patient whose temp is &gt;=101.0, and on no patients whose temp is &lt;101.0)

* Being excessively dogmatic with antibiotic courses in situations of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. a patient with known Staph bacteremia who is estimated to have a ~10% chance of endocarditis must be treated with 6 weeks of IV antibiotics because endocarditis wasn’t “ruled out”).

* When infection control won’t let us take a patient off respiratory isolation for TB until they have been formally ruled out, despite the order having been placed accidentally. (yes, this really happened!)



**Pain management**

* Dosing narcotics less frequently than their duration of action. (i.e. oxycodone bid)

* Ordering acetaminophen as the only prn pain med in a patient whose chief complaint is pain.

* Refusing to give narcotics to an inpatient with a history of substance abuse, irrespective of how severe their acute pain is.



**Neuro**

* Documenting a patient’s neuro exam as “non-focal”. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was a neurologic symptom)

* Not assessing the gait of a patient on admission. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was “weakness” or “falls”)

* The use of a stethoscope head as a reflex hammer.

* Reflexively ordering a vitamin B12, TSH, and RPR in every patient presenting with altered mental status.

* When the reason for a patient’s admission and/or their documented chief complaint is “altered mental status” without any further description (e.g. excessive drowsiness, agitation, hallucinations, disorientation, etc…)

* Reporting the results of a head CT as “negative”.



**Psych**

* Calling a psych consult on a medicine inpatient with stable depression. (bonus annoyance points if the patient will be discharged within a day and already has a close relationship with an outpatient psychiatrist)

* Overreliance on antipsychotics for delirium before first attempting non-pharmacologic strategies.



**Orthopedics**

* When a ortho resident attempts to turf an admission to medicine because the patient is “too medically complex”, despite the fact that the ortho service is comanaged by a dedicated hospitalist 24/7.



**Urology**

* When a medicine resident calls a urology resident for help placing a urinary catheter that the nurses couldn’t place, and the urologist requests that the medicine residents try to place it first. (bonus annoyance points when the urologist then becomes irate when informed that the med resident subsequently caused urethral trauma)



**Emergency Medicine**

* When the ED calls to admit a patient for “r/o chest pain” without first getting an ECG.

* When the ED gives antibiotics without first acquiring relevant cultures.

* When the ED tells the only family member who can provide critical collateral information that they can go home before the admitting doc has had a chance to speak with them. 

* When a medicine R2 debates with a ED attending of 25 years’ experience about the need for a patient to be admitted without consideration of their unequal years of experience.



**Radiology**

* When a radiologist determines whether a patient with impaired renal function can receive contrast for either CT or MRI based only on the serum creatinine, without considering age, muscle mass, comorbid conditions, indication for scan, or the availability of reasonable alternatives to the scan.

* When the interpreting radiologist for a scan doesn’t address the stated indication for the scan within the interpretation.

* When the primary team orders a radiology study and doesn’t include an accurate indication in the request.

* When a radiologist won’t approve a seasoned hospitalist’s request for an MRI brain until a neurology R2 concurs (bonus annoyance points if it’s July).



**Communication/Charting**

* Charting “Code Status: DNR/DNI” in an admission H&amp;P without any indication as to how that decision was made.

* When a consultant stops seeing a patient without communicating that they are signing off.

* When a consultant conveys to an intern on the primary team that they feel really strongly about a particular course of action, but then don’t speak with the hospitalist directly, and don’t convey the strength of that recommendation in the chart.

* When a consultant conveys to a patient that they will/will not be discharged that day, without first discussing it with the primary team.

* Referring to a family member as “the wife” or “the son”. (it’s his/her wife, his/her son)

* Referring to the patient as “Mr.” or “Mrs.” so-and-so when speaking to a family member. (much better to say “*your* father/mother/brother/sister/etc…”)

* Ignoring the nurse during walk rounds, despite he/she standing right there at the bedside.

* When housestaff signout to the on-call team and spend 30 seconds on each of 10 patients, rather than handing over a list of 9 patients, and spending 5 minutes discussing the one patient who is particularly sick/complicated.

* Documenting a chief complaint that consists of a laundry list of 15 unrelated medical problems (“Ms. Smith is a 60 year old woman with a past history significant for hypertension, smoking, homelessness, osteoarthritis, CKD, COPD, basal cell carcinoma, breast cancer s/p mastectomy and chemo, DVT in 2010, onychomycosis, and chronic low grade transaminitis, now presenting with LLE cellulitis”)

* Documenting an assessment in an H&amp;P that’s word-for-word identical to its chief complaint.

* Failing to look at the reason for presentation as documented by the ED triage nurse (it’s amazing how often the ED triage nurse, ED doc, and admitting medicine resident’s chief complaints are inconsistent)

* When the med list in the discharge instructions, med list in the discharge summary, and the official outpatient medication list in the EMR all disagree.

* When the respiratory rate of every patient on the ward is documented as either 18 or 20.

* When I/Os are fastidiously recorded on patients for whom it’s irrelevant, and patients with renal failure are recorded as having “bathroom privileges”.

* Stating “the patient *failed* such-and-such chemo regimen”. (Patients don’t fail chemo regimens; it’s the chemo regimens that fail patients)

* Stating “the patient *refused* their 3am lab draw”. (Better to say “the patient *declined* their 3am lab draw”.)

* Getting worked up over the difference between “historian” and “informant”. (This is one word choice on the wards that does actually seems trivial.)

* When a doc talks disparagingly about NAs, RNs, NPs, and/or PAs as an entire profession.

* When a non-doc talks disparagingly about docs as an entire profession (bonus annoyance points if it’s an NP wearing a “heart of a nurse, brain of a doctor” shirt)



**General**

* Referring to professional society guidelines as if they were laws that must be followed.

* Lean

* Referring to patients as “customers”. (bonus annoyance points if it’s during a daily huddle to discuss lean management techniques)

* When someone cancels a lab order and doesn’t inform the ordering doc. (bonus annoyance points if it’s a phlebotomist who felt that a delirious, semi-comatose patient “refused” the blood draw)

* When an outside hospital transfers a patient and fails to include a discharge summary. (bonus annoyance points if they include 100+ pages of nursing notes)

* Attempting to discharge a patient without first assessing how the patient is going to get home.

* Citing a study in a progress note that doesn’t actually support whatever point the writer was implying it supported.

* Failing to question an unexpected, bizarre lab value as possibly being “bad data”. (“Sure, I suppose this person recovering from a hip fracture, whose sodium yesterday was normal, could have a sodium of 90 today, but maybe we should recheck it first before starting the 3% saline…”)

* When a PMD insists that the patient they are trying to directly admit to a particular medicine ward is appropriate for that level of care, despite the doc never having stepped foot on the ward in question.

* Making a medical decision primarily based on metrics or patient satisfaction ratings.

* Failing to adequately incorporate a patient’s personal preferences and social situation in crafting a treatment plan.

* When one runs to the coffee shop to make it just before closing, only to find that they decided to close 5 minutes early.",405,562.0,2017-10-02,PHARMA,0.1610925178974867,0.8136245161294937,0.025282954331487417

Called the on call OR team in to do a case. While I'm putting in orders and dictating the ER calls back and says the ER nurse told to huc to cancel the surgery and tell the call team to go home because the patient has a baby and can't find anyone to watch the baby while they're in surgery.

The charge nurse gets here and calls the OR manager who says that one of the postop nurses can't watch the baby until family can gets here because of liability.

Ultimately the family is supposedly coming to get the baby in a little but it's postponing the surgery (which is ok in this situation for a short period of time). 

What if the surgery was emergent and no family is around? Is there a policy for this situation?",27,60.0,2017-10-04,PHARMA,0.09207499027252197,0.8778055310249329,0.030119506642222404

medicine,Lost another doc to depression,"This one was also a family member: a cousin who was just finishing his residency. In the med school I am associated with, it's the second trainee suicide this year (earlier was a student, and now a recent graduate)

I don't know what I'm looking for here. I think I already have a pretty good feel for what we're doing wrong. Anyone who's seen a colleague, especially a trainee, suffering from depression and needing help knows full well how the gossip goes. I'm sick to death of having to defend trainees who need time or help, to associates who can't seem to understand that needing help isn't weakness and taking time to recover from illness doesn't impact your ability to practice.

We can be bad even about organic illness, but in residency I had two health problems. One was organic, and I had a single minor hiccup in getting it dealt with. The other was mental health (postpartum depression) and I had to skirt close to legally threatening a preceptor who found out and seemed to think it was somehow not just her right but her duty to report a transient health issue to the residency program (despite it having been resolved a few months earlier, when I sought and got appropriate help during my parental leave).

We suck at this. If anyone has any insight into how to make us suck less, I'd love to hear it. I'll bring it up to those who might be willing to listen after the losses we've suffered.

medicine,Insane ethics case,"So I heard about this case while on the interview trail and I'll never forget it, I'm wondering if any of you have come across anything similar:

Middle aged male gets heart transplant, surgery goes well and he initially recovers 
Then gets acute rejection 
Has to be placed on ECMO while another heart is looked for
Hospital rule is after x amount of days on ECMO, if no transition plan, ECMO must be turned off (this rule I'm assuming was initially intended for code patients that received ECMO instead of ROSC and never recovered after code)

Day X approaches, patient is intubated but WIDE awake and lucid, is told ECMO must be turned off, no heart available (he and family were told days in advance and were well informed about the rule)

Patient, family beg and plead for ECMO to remain on

ECMO discontinued.

Patient immediately died.

What do you all think about this?
Where to even begin? 

Edit: 
Sorry, forgot to mention, his transplanted heart had to be removed due to the acute rejection, the rejection leads to necrosis and an assist device wouldn't work because you still need to suture it to a structurally intact heart 

The manufacturer of the total artificial heart lists an indication as transplant rejection, I'm just not sure why it wasn't done here, perhaps they didn't have it

2nd Edit:
So as an interviewee it was not my place to stop rounds and be like ""can you go over this case from step 1""
All I know for certain is that the attending and other members of the IDT meeting all seemed to be in agreement that as a matter of fact, ECMO was discontinued in a lucid patient.

It does seem feasible that when the heart acutely rejected, the transplant team approached the family and said something along the lines of ""Mr. X's new heart is failing and it's only a matter of hours before he dies, we can place him on a heart machine but this is a very intense and very limited resource.  If after 2 weeks if we do not have a new heart, we will turn off the heart machine because this is something that could be needed to give another dying patient their only chance to live....Do you agree?""

Family of course would say yes because options are:

1) he either dies now for sure, or 

2 ) maybe he dies after 2 weeks, maybe we find a new heart and he lives 

A separate discussion is, did the team even have to offer ECMO in the first place? What if no ECMO
Machines were available? The fact that it's available, does that ethically commit the hospital/team to use that resource indefinitely?",51,54.0,2017-10-08,PHARMA,0.03035682998597622,0.9347853660583496,0.034857749938964844

medicine,What do very current studies say about the health complications of vaginal vs cesarean birth?,"The health ministry in my (eastern European) country is pushing to forcefully lower c section rates. It's usually older doctors that speak ex cathedra about how bad elective c-sections are and how much better vaginal births are, without giving any numbers. So I did some research into the subject and came up with two conclusions: risky pregnancies and emergency c-sections drive up the numbers for risks of c-sections, so this number cannot be used for elective c-sections. Second, there are studies that show that c-sections cut pelvic disorders almost by half. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/OXdIA) one chart. So I'm starting to think that some 'ad naturam' fallacy might be at play here and this 'belief' might be based on data from 30 years ago that older medical academics just drum into new medics without actually researching it (there are examples of such outdated myths being perpetuated in medicine for decades, so it wouldn't be a precedence) Is there anyone who's very up to date on studies on this subject?

I worked for Cvs for over 10 years, but only 2.5 years as a Pharmacist. Those were some of the toughest years, in that time I did make alot of money but really took a toll on me. I was miserable, I had trouble sleeping, my relationships became strained, I became a very unhappy person. 

I was fortunate to find a contract job with the military. I took a significant pay cut. It was a huge risk as the contract was only for 1 year, it was a hour from my house, no health insurance or 401k. I jumped ship and started. For the first year it was great the leadership that hired me was still around. Then new leadership came in and the whole moral changed to what it is now. It's nowhere near CVS but it has become uncomfortable.  I was fortunate that my contract was renewed for a year, im not sure if it will be renewed again, I usually find out 2 weeks before it ends. 

I don't regret the decision to leave CVS, even if I am unemployed it's better then working there. I still cherish the experience there because it made me a stronger person.

And the other script said take 2 at night. So like 99% of pharmacists I'm like...i need to verify this with the MD to see what he wants me to fill. So after drama with the patient (who is clearly abusing it) for not being able to pick it up till I verify, the MD calls an hour later sounding pissed. And hes like its aa clear as the sun. He sent 2 because they are a continuation. One script says the full regimen, 2 at night and 1 in the morning. And the other is just the night tablets, so for the script that has the full regimen I would only consider it as if it only for the morning tablets. tldr: he broke up a single benzo script into 2 scripts..morning tablets and night tablets...

pharmacy,"Just when you thought that Allergan couldn't get any more scummy, they might give the patent to a Native American tribe to thwart generic competition.","taken from here : http://www.pharmacychoice.com/News/article.cfm?Article_ID=1841998

&gt;&gt;It's tough being a pharmaceutical company when your patent rights run out - the generic competition rushes in, and profits go down on a drug that you may have spent time and money to develop way back when.

&gt;&gt;But the drug company Allergan has been doing some creative thinking about this when it comes to an eye medicine called Restasis. They're transferring the drug to a Native American tribe in upstate New York.

&gt;&gt;Veteran business columnist Joe Nocera, who wrote about the topic in Bloomberg View, stopped by to explain how this move works and what'll happen to the availability of generic drugs if other companies start doing this. Below is an edited transcript.

&gt;&gt;David Brancaccio: So how are the good people of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe going to help Allergan?

&gt;&gt;Joe Nocera: Well, they are a sovereign entity. And if you're a sovereign entity, you have certain immunities from federal law. And one of those immunities apparently is patents. Allegan has said we're going to transfer our patent to you, you fine people of the Native American tribe the St. Regis Mohawks. We're going to pay you an annual royalty and some upfront money, and our competitors who are trying to avoid our patent at the patent office will be stopped because the patent office can't challenge a sovereign entity.

&gt;&gt;Related Drug prices: how generics changed the game

&gt;&gt;Is competition the solution to high drug prices?

&gt;&gt;Brancaccio: Now, in your column, you know that there are voices on Wall Street who seem to cheer this cool maneuver.

&gt;&gt;Nocera: Wall Street wants companies like Allergan to be able to maintain monopoly prices on brand name drugs. I mean, this is the really important part. Restasis has been on the market since 2002. Its original patent ran out in 2014. So there should have been generics on the market three years ago. But, companies now have learned that what you do is you make a little change in the dosage, you make a little change here, you make a little change in the formula. And you put a whole new bunch of patents around it, and you try to extend the patent life another 12 years or another 10 years. But, truly, it violates - at the minimum - the spirit of the law that basically says generics should be able to come in and give the American public cheaper prices. This is one reason, by the way, that health care costs so much.

&gt;&gt;Brancaccio: Now the pharma companies will say, ""OK, you're just looking at this one drug. In this case, Restasis. We spent tons of money trying to develop other drugs that failed. So this is one way we can recoup some of that.""

&gt;&gt;Nocera: The law is basically saying you've had your window, now it's time to do something for the American people. And the companies are saying, well, we don't really want to do anything for the American people - we really want to help our shareholders.

&gt;&gt;Brancaccio: Part of the trouble here is that there are several sets of laws. One, the Native nation and one, the laws of the United States.

&gt;&gt;Nocera: Well, that is true. And I should note that this maneuver - which is what it is - will be challenged. But if Allergan succeeds in doing this, I can guarantee you that the Native American tribes around the country are all going to get into the patent business, and every drug company on earth is going to start transferring patents to Native American tribes. So it really could put a damper on the generic business.

tl;dr The Restatis patent might be given to a sovereign Indian tribe who might be able to keep the patent indefinably due to potential immunity from US patent law. They will get a royalty from Allergan while they keep raking in that sweet Restatis money.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. So I'm a P3 intern at the 3 letter in bullseye store and I've recently realized basically all the technicians are making my wage (15$ hour) OR higher. This isn't meant to be an insult to technicians, I think they deserve that, but i also think I should be making at least a little bit higher because I really do a lot of the extra responsibilities. I've been in the pharmacy for 4 years and I feel like I got screwed over the way the takeover happened. Basically target paid techs higher than interns so when we switched over I basically have not gotten a raise in two years while all the techs are now higher in pay than me. Plus - min wage in NY is going up to 15$ so basically I'm gonna be close to min wage by the time I graduate. 

What are your opinions on this? I know I'm gonna make more next year when I graduate but I mean I'm busting my ass thru school and paying a ton of loans and I feel a little shorted.

pharmacy,‘I could hire new grads at half of what I pay you’,"Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this story, but quite honestly it’s been keeping me up at night, and this seems like a place where people understand the current state of pharmacy as a career...and if this post helps even one person in any way, it makes it worth it. 

I graduated from RX school in 1997. Practiced retail at a few different chains, held positions as high as market director (supervised the RX part of 29 stores). As time went on, I saw the pharmacist shortage become a surplus (as more schools popped up, and cranked out more and more grads), and tried to prepare accordingly. Which, more or less, I have - I’d been working at a certain very large big-box company for about 10 years, as an ‘H2O full-timer’: 24-hour/week base, but despite the promise of a ‘regular schedule template’, I was pretty much sent across 3 states, unpaid for travel time (sometimes stores 2 hrs away) with absolutely no regularity in scheduling. It wasn’t great, but I usually managed to get about 30 hours, fill the scripts and push the shots while still being short on staff like we all are.  Plenty of unpaid late night hours were ‘donated’ in my attempts to leave a clean store for the morning person. Again, not a great setup, but it is what it is.  

Until, last April, store meetings were held across the market. My particular event consisted of about 5 techs , 9 pharmacists, and the MHWD (area boss). The first hour was a video and rah-rah-rah session about upcoming ‘changes’ that would make us even better at serving our patients, etc. Then, the techs were all allowed to go home. With zero fanfare, compassion, or empathy, our MHWD proceeded to:

-Fire all the grad interns

-Fire all the part-time hourly pharmacists and

-Inform all staff pharmacists they’d be taking an hour cut from 40/week to 32/week. 

Boom. Done. 

Now remember: this all happened at a table, in a meeting room in personnel - all 9 faces looking at each other in absolute shock (except the 2 who were crying).

Then, the boss came to the ‘H2O’ people (myself included). She said she had 5 of us currently (why on EARTH she’d hired so many was beyond me, I thought it was myself and one other person) but only had hours for 2 of us. I didn’t make the cut (can tell you my theories on why not, but this is a 100% factual tale, no conjecture) so 3 of us were ‘offered’ a bump down to hourly positions - no guaranteed hours, and the implementation of something called Shift Bidding, which basically means the person who lives closest to an open shift gets it. 

She closed the meeting by adding the quote that’s the subject of my post:

‘I could hire new grads at half of what I pay you.’

Still, I decided to hang in there, work the remaining shifts I was scheduled for. Until, one day, this very same MHWD happened to stroll into a store I was covering (short-handed 2 techs, out of 4...100RXs left from the person who’d closed).  Instead of helping, she starts quizzing these terrified techs the usual stuff: tamper-proof RX policy, Refusal-to-Fill, etc. The lines begin to grow. My part of the process is totally caught up, but the techs simply can’t Input and Fill anywhere near quickly enough. Boss just ignores it. Finally I ask, totally politely, if I can jump in and do ‘tech work’ to help out. Boss says, sure, but you have to have a login for that store - which I don’t, because no one has codes for 50 stores. She says it’s a ‘Terminable Offense’ to fill under someone else’s codes, so I don’t. 

5 minutes later, the line has gotten so insane that the boss finally cracks. She grabs the handheld and starts filling. I say ‘oh, cool, do you have a universal login or something?’ 

We both look down at the handheld, and it’s still signed in as the tech who’s currently ringing register. 

Boss gives a guilty smile, shrugs, and says nothing. 

So I walked over to the restroom, texted my wife, and told her I was about to resign (we’d discussed it before).  Full wife support.  30 minutes later, my ‘overlap’ pharmacist arrived (was supposed to be 8 hrs, cut down to 4). I took the opportunity to ask to speak to the boss in private. ‘Sure!’ Gave my resignation, which she immediately accepted. In fact, she said I could leave right then. 

It was all extremely civil. 

I filled out my paperwork (voluntary resignation, Rehirable status), turned in my badge and discount card (hardest thing to lose!) and walked out the door. 

No ‘good luck’, ‘thanks for your decade of service’, nothing. 

Now let me finish by saying this: everything in this post is a fact. It all happened. Now, some of you may be thinking, ‘this guy must just suck as a pharmacist, he’s just bitter, etc’.   Sticking to facts only: 

I’ve never gotten less than a glowing performance review, ever

I’ve been a pharmacist, pharmacy manager, and Pharmacy District Manager

In 20 years of practice, I allowed one dispensing error. One. No patient harm. 

Thanks for reading this long post. Any and all feedback is welcome. And to those who are just starting out: fair warning. This has become the new RX reality. It’s NEVER too late to change course.

medicine,Thoughts on RN's being able to prescribe medications,"Hey everybody

I'm a registered nurse from Ontario, Canada. Our provincial government has announced that they are working on legislation that would allow Registered nurses throughout the province to prescribe medications. They have asked an advisory council in support of RN prescribing to investigate the best framework in which this can be done.

I personally think this is a terrible idea.  I feel that nursing education (at least at the university I attended) did not have nearly enough emphasis on diagnosing patients or on pharmacology to safely include prescribing into my scope of practice.

I can understand doing this in areas of the province where accessibility to care is a serious barrier. In remote and northern areas of the province, at least how the benefits of this may possibly outweigh the risks.  However, to do this province wide scares me. 

 
Is there anyone here from Ontario (or other places doing the same thing) that agrees/disagrees?
Is there anyone here that works in an area where RN's are already allowed to prescribe? How do you feel about it?

EDIT:
Thank you all for your input. I see a lot of people that are asking for more information or backstory. Here is a pretty good link that presents both sides of the issue.

medicine,How do you quickly establish a rapport with your patient and make them feel comfortable?,"Hi /r/medicine, 

I am not a medical professional (yet!), but I do volunteer at a free clinic where some of my duties include occasionally taking patient vitals and educating patients about certain health conditions or how they can improve diet or exercise in their daily lives. One question I have for all of you who are more experienced than I am - how do you establish a rapport with your patients? How can I help them relax a little and laugh or smile?

I know this may not be possible for every patient but it is something I would like to work on and something I feel is important in any healthcare field. I don't have a super outgoing personality so sometimes it's a little hard maintaining a normal conversation while checking vitals and also asking medical questions. What are some things you all do or tips you follow?

Edit: I know that this can take time to build over multiple visits and conversations with the patient, but I use the word ""quickly"" in my title as I often only see the patients for 10-15 minutes while I am taking vitals or talking about health education so anything that could help in that kind of scenario would be really helpful

We got a fake Prometh script today and I called the cops after asking my RXM if I should. He agreed with me so they came and arrested the individual. Once they leave my store manager told me to come to the office and said  she's writing me up for harassing a customer and some other BS?? I asked her who and she stated there was no reason to call the cops and she should of either filled the script or given it back. I even called the doctor and asked him and he said it was fake so I wouldn't have done either anyways and would have torn it up if I didn't call the cops.

I walked away without signing anything and told my RXM what was going and he couldn't understand her thinking. After I refused to sign she decided to come back to the pharmacy and told me to leave for the day which my RXM said I'm his employee not hers and they just bickered back and forth.  First thing Monday morning she'll be hearing from my PDM since me and her are close and this will get fun real fast.

Update:

So the store manager got fired as this seemed like it was the last straw in a number of things the DM didn't like about her.

medicine,"Off my chest - I put a central line today, and the patient developed pneumothorax.","I dont know if this is the right sub for this, but fuck it. I feel like I need to vent, and you guys are usually quite supportive. 

Background - physician at a large hospital in my country (don't want to reveal more, privacy etc etc). I have had around 4 years of experience in the ICU and ER. I must've put around 100+ central lines, and at my peak, could do it with my eyes closed (figure of speech btw). So, I've been out of active action in the ICU/ER for the past 6 months (personal issues) - and today I got the chance to put a central line in a patient. Easy peasy right. Done this a million times. The patient was hypotensive (MAP 50), and this wasn't USG guided. I prep myself, get in position, but I couldn't feel the carotid pulse at all. I tried the right side for 2 picks, and on the second prick, I felt the pressure give way and I hit bone. I immediately knew I fucked up, and started sweating like a pig. I withdrew the needle, and proceeded to put it in the left side - and I got it in the first prick. Immediate xray was fine, but I knew I had fucked up pretty badly. 6 hours later, I get a (very angry call) from one of the senior team members saying that the patient has developed pneumothorax, and had to undergo ICD insertion as a result, and that I learn from this and not repeat this ever again.

Couple of things here I feel like I want to get off of my chest - this is the first time in my whole career I've had pneumo due while inserting a central line. It felt surreal and heavy. I've seen it happen tons of times, but this is the first time it has happened to me. Yes, it has shaken my confidence a little bit. The relatives of the patient were quite ok when I informed them - I felt really, really bad though. Guilty almost. I was dreading this very complication when I picked up the needle after 6 months, and it happened. I was happy that I got the left side easily at one go, but all of it was down the trash can the moment my worst fears were confirmed. Will I continue to put central lines freely after this? I don't know - maybe I'll ask someone to be with me as a standby.

What do you guys think? Had something like this (not necessarily this complication, but something that shakes your confidence) happen to you? How do you deal with it? 

Again, I understand that this may feel like a 'small' inconsequential thing to many, but bear with me. I feel like I need to get this off my chest.",85,47.0,2017-10-23,PHARMA,0.08512736111879349,0.8846144676208496,0.030258147045969963

I'm working around 60-100 hours/week right now as I am very eager to pay down the medical debt. I had about 180k on graduation and its loomed over me for years, but I'll be debt free in January.

I sometimes worry that I am not studying enough anymore, or attending conferences. I really don't want to become one of those outdated physicians not in touch with current practice standards.

-Don't get divorced (I'm still single)
-Be nice to everybody 
-Always engage the patient in shared decision making
-Don't let lifestyle creep

pharmacy,Reminder to be careful when using your states PMP,"I practice in Indiana. Just recently 3 pharmacists had disciplinary action taken by our BOP after it was found out they searched for Prince's PMP records after his death. So there are people who are checking this stuff, don't ever search anyone you are not caring for directly, even when showing someone how PMP works. Never share the report (fax, email, mail, or copy), if a physician or anyone else asks you to run a PMP report for them, use your judgement for this one time but always tell them you can not do this for them in the future and they need to sign up (INSPECT actually just made this a lot easier, other states will vary). Most states also allow a designee to run PMP reports, so make sure you really trust yours if you have one, anything they do wrong will also be on your back too.

medicine,How do you handle patients overusing healthcare due to (probable) mental issues?,"Throwaway account for legal reasons.

As some American readers here have probably inferred, I work as a resident in a European country where healthcare and prescription meds be free beyond a certain principal (a modest $200 or so per year). I'm a junior resident doing rotations at a big University Hospital with 900+ beds. I have countless examples to share regarding craziness that arises from having a non-functioning primary care system and even worse psychiatric care, but two patients stand out to me as being completely beyond-the-pale impossible to resolve:

Patient 1:

Woman, 55 years old. Have been visiting the Emergency Dept (ED) on average every other day for the last four years, totalling about 700 visits. Now, it started out with low back pain, but now she shows up for basically everything ranging from small amounts of blood in her stool (as in when wiping) to constipation (gee, I wonder if that relates to the first one), to knee ache (she's 200+ lbs) to acne. 

And thing is, as long as she in her primary interview with the triage nurse says anything to the effect of her symptoms being new, a doctor has to look at her. She's been referred for hundreds of x-rays, been farmed out to primary care as many times (she goes there all the other days when not terrorizing us) and gets blood drawn every damn visit and nothing is ever found to be wrong. This woman obviously has some kind of cognitive defect that makes her unable to understand that an ED in the middle of the night is not the place and time to get your chronic constipation checked, but lo and behold, there she comes again. She is not a danger to herself and others, and is unwilling to submit to any notion of psychiatric care. What would you do? 


Patient 2:

Woman, 56 years. Ehler-Danlos with chronic pain issues. Diabetes osteomyelitis left leg that was resected and amputated above knee about 14 months ago. She's been in the hospital since because of continuous septicemia episodes and osteitis requiring vacs and irrigation about 3 times a week. Pushing about 300mg of morphine  equivalents every day. Recently we've started to suspect that she is causing her septicemias herself. A rummage through her stuff reveals empty syringes with yellowish goo inside and she's been seen sneaking around the ward at night in her wheelchair. And at times seem just a bit too high on opioids to have been caused by her tightly controlled methadone schedule. 

All iv's have subsequently been pulled and now she gets everything p.o. A big noticeable-if-tampered-with dressing has been put over her wound. But of course she plays dumb lately and ostensibly ""drops"" or ""forgets"" to take the f*cking antibiotics. Result? Not mich change. Still taking up a room, making sure every other goddamn patient on the floor has to be screened for carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter and taking up at least 3 surgery time slots every week (where she always has to be allotted a ridiculously long slot because of that one time she has something reminiscent of malignant anasthesia-related hypertension)

This woman is a danger to herself but not in the immediate sense, and also our laws do not allow forced medication for somatic illnesses. She's been at the hospital for more than a whole damn year and it's not clear whether she is just a clear cut Münchhausen or so liking the dope that she is willing to inject herself/smear her amputee stump with her own poo in order to stay. If discharged she would probably end up smearing poo in her sutures right outside the hospital entrance and be readmitted. What would you do?

medicine,Afraid of doctors.,"So this is pretty silly, but Im a nurse who is ""afraid"" of doctors. What I mean is, I get very anxious when speaking with them, even if theres absolutely no reason to be anxious. I cant have a normal conversation, its more like I speak in short sentences to convey my ideas and afterwards I realize I missed talking about something I wanted to mention, because of my anxiety. I feel like most of it comes from me knowing I know very little about medicine, which puts me in a vulnerable spot. Many times I try to research a patients chart and diagnosis before I place a page to have as many answers as possible, then I'll get a question I didnt even think of and awkwardly have to click through the chart to find the answer. Basically, Im afraid my anxiety is causing doctors to doubt my knowledge and skill because I get so nervous speaking with them I dont tell them everything which leaves me feeling like they think of me as someone who isnt very smart.",52,125.0,2017-10-31,PHARMA,0.18639224767684937,0.7875025868415833,0.02610519714653492
