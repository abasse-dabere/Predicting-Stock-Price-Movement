medicine,Colistin-resistant E. coli in the United States - what does it mean? (crosspost r/pharmacy),"I originally posted this in r/pharmacy yesterday or so, and one comment suggested I post this over here too. So here goes. Please feel free to weigh in!

Last week there were a few headlines related to “the superbug doctors have been dreading,” and some comments regarding sensationalism. I wanted to take a couple paragraphs to review the facts and discuss the clinical implications, while hopefully avoiding sensationalism.


**Where it all Began**

The spread of the *mcr-1* gene is impressive. It was first reported by a research team out of China last November.(1) Researchers isolated a colistin-resistant strain of *E. coli* from a pig. This *E. coli* was capable of transferring colistin resistance to other bacteria, a phenomenon not seen before. Previously, colistin resistance had always arisen secondary to chromosomal mutations, not transfer of genetic elements. The research team used whole genome sequencing to characterize the resistance gene, *mcr-1*, which was found on a plasmid. They subsequently assessed prevalence of the resistance gene by screening isolates collected across China between 2011 and 2014. The team identified *mcr-1* carriage in 78/523 raw meat samples, 166/804 animal samples, and 16/1322 inpatient samples.

**The USA Report**

On May 26th, *Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy* reported what seems to be the first case of an *E. coli* strain harboring the *mcr-1* gene being isolated from a human in the United States.(2) The patient was a 49 y/o woman who presented to a clinic in Pennsylvania with symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Of note, the patient had not traveled outside the United States in the previous 5 months. The isolate was sent to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for susceptibility testing (I am assuming this is standard practice for the clinic, but that is not explicitly clear from the case report), where it was determined the organism was an ESBL-producing *E. coli*. Walter Reed had recently started screening all ESBL-producing *E. coli* for colistin resistance, ever since the initial report of a plasmid-borne colistin resistance gene last winter, and so used an E-test to determine colistin susceptibility.

The isolate was one of the first 6 ESBLs screened at Walter Reed for colistin resistance. The colistin MIC was 4 mcg/mL (~~CLSI breakpoint &lt;/= 0.25 mcg/mL~~ **SEE EDIT**). Real-time PCR detected the presence of the *mcr-1* gene. The isolate’s genome was then sequenced. Two plasmids carrying a total of 15 resistance genes were isolated. Most notable from this sequencing was the revelation that the colistin resistance gene (*mcr-1*) was on the same plasmid as the ESBL gene (CTX-M). No carbapenemase genes were identified. Additionally, the genes were on an IncF plasmid, which is a plasmid associated with a high rate of genetic transfer.

At the time of publication, Walter Reed had tested a total of 26 isolates and no others carried were resistant to colistin. The actual report does not detail the outcome of the patient in question, but my understanding is she was treated with other antibiotics. This is the first known case in the United States of a bacteria carrying *mcr-1*.

**Like a Double Rainbow, What Does it Mean?**

The isolate from the US remained susceptible to several antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and amikacin. Thus, the isolate does not, on its own, warrant any great concern. In fact, if Walter Reed had not been screening isolates specifically for colistin resistance, no one would have known. Colistin susceptibility testing is not done clinically unless necessary, like with carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae. But even though this isolate was not a pan-resistant superbug, there are some broad implications that we should consider.

**Takeaway 1: This is the first case of *mcr-1* in the United States, *because we just started looking for it*.** Because we did not know this gene existed before last November, no one was looking for it. Additionally, most microbiology labs are not set up to perform genetic sequencing for specific genes, unless it comes as part of a PCR platform (e.g. BioFire, Verigene, T2). So in reality, this is likely just the tip of the iceberg. Since the publication of the first report in November, researchers across the globe have sequenced historic isolates from food, environmental, and clinical samples and tested for *mcr-1*. There are over two dozen publications related to findings of *mcr-1* in Asia, Europe, and Canada.(3) In other words, *mcr-1* is global and has been found in isolates first collected as far back as 2005, so it is in all likelihood present in the United States.

**Takeaway 2: While this isolate was treatable, pan-resistance may be around the corner.** In this case, *mcr-1* co-occurred with an ESBL gene, both on a single plasmid. But there are at least 4 reports of *mcr-1* isolated in conjunction with a carbapenemase (1 animal and 3 clinical isolates). Even more concerning, is 2 of those 4 isolates involved the carbapenemase NDM, against which none of the new Gram-negative agents are active.(3) The NDM/*mcr-1* clinical isolate was susceptible only to amikacin.(4) All told, these trends suggest to me that something needs to be done to curb the pressures leading to spread of these resistance genes.

**Takeaway 3: This is an environmental and veterinary problem first and a clinical problem second.** China seems to be the world’s largest user of colistin for agricultural/veterinary use, and is also where this resistance gene was first isolated. Perhaps coincidence, perhaps not. Either way, the wonton use of antibiotics for livestock needs to be reined in. Interventions on the clinical side (isolation, antimicrobial stewardship, etc) can only do so much, and the Gram-negative pipeline is grim right now.

In summary, the isolate found in the US was not the harbinger of the antibiotic apocalypse. But, it is something to be concerned about and likely represents the tip of the iceberg. Fortunately, carbapenemase + colistin resistance remains very rare. But we need to take steps to limit the spread of resistance and mitigate risk of pan-resistant infections in the future. Hopefully this was a somewhat unbiased review of what has been going on with *mcr-1* over the last 6 months.

medicine,"What is the most accurate piece of ""TV medicine"" you've seen?","Was watching ""Jurassic Park: The Lost World"" on TV last week and I noticed that the scene where they were transporting the T-rex to the harbour had this dialogue which contained some of the most accurate ""tv medicine"" scene that i've seen. The T-rex which was sedated and being transported suddenly gets up and starts fucking shit up. The dino vet lady/guy gets questioned as to why t-rex is awake and tells the ven  to hit the dino with more carfentanil to sedate it. The vet person then reponds yea we hit it with 10mg of it and the t-rex started breathing slower and slower and so we had to give some naltrexone. Which caused the t-rex to wake up and start fucking shit up and them being unable to do anything to sedate it.

Although that was some vetenarian(?) medicine I thought that it was suprisingly accurate for jurassic park. Carfentanil is a fentanyl analogue that is supposedly 100 times more potent than fentanyl and approximately 10000 times more potent than morphine. It is considered too potent for human use and the strongest fentanyl analogue that is used on humans is sufentanil which is about 10 - 20 times weaker than carfentanil.  Carfentanil is mainly used for sedating large zoo animals. 10 mg seems like a very reasonable dose for a large t-rex. I've heard of  ~ 5 - 10 mcg doses of carfentanil being sold on darknetmarkets for people to get high off. Extrapolating from that, it wouldn't seem too unlikely to try and give a large t-rex 10mg.  Another fun fact is that carfentanil is suspected to be the knockout gas that they used in the Moscow theatre hostage crisis in 2002. Over 120 people died because the government refused to reveal what the agent was and did not inform emergency response services or nearby hospitals about what agent was used. Most that died did so from respiratory failure and choking on their tongues when unconscious.

medicine,ECG of the day #5,"[ECG's Here](http://imgur.com/a/Znpvx)

An older woman presented with a completely unrelated issue but on review of her history had an interesting zebra in her cardiac history. I looked at her ECGs and thought I would share them. Looking back it looks like she presented with  episodes of SVT, I can't find any documentation of VT (until after she had her ICD placed).  If you want to give it a quick shot (I don't think her ECGs are classic and would never have made this diagnosis) don't read below the line (EDIT:  Apparently reddit won't let me put in a bunch of white space and this subreddit doesn't have ""spoiler text"" enabled to my knowledge, sorry).

.
.


ARVD (Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dyplasia/Cardiomyopathy).  Her diagnosis was based ultimately on a cardiac MRI that in our system was read as being nonspecific but had a second opinion over-read from UCSF to be consistent with ARVD.

I would like to hear from any cardiologists or EPs if there is anything about her ECGs that would clue you into that diagnosis.  From my understanding the epsilon wave is usually seen in the right sided precordial leads and she really doesn't have that, the closest thing to me is the little blip in aVL.  Furthermore she really doesn't have TWI in V1-V3 either.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Clinical Presentation: 
25 y/o female came to the ER and presented with abdominal pain, EM docs turfed her up to the wards due to overflow. Ultrasound was ordered, no hx given, so I contacted the IM doc, H&amp;P he gave me was not sufficient, so I went up myself. Upon H&amp;P, several things were discovered. Abdominal pain was diffuse in nature and had been present for 8 months. Patient also stated she was fatigued. No weight loss, and no other gastrointestinal issues. Pain radiated to the back, but pain was ""not as bad"" in the back as it was in her abdomen. Pain was significantly worse in the RLQ, and marginally worse in the LLQ. Patient stated that abdominal pain was not relieved with any OTC analgesics(yes she stated those exact words, she was a medical student).  Mass was palpated roughly around the border between the RUQ and RLQ. Laboratory and Medical History were otherwise unremarkable.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Now the fun part(yay for radiology!)
Radiology Part 1:
Upon clinical findings, I had the patient brought to radiology.

Abdominal u/s exam: Upon my examination, a well-defined complex cystic lesion was appreciated in the RUQ, with multiple cystic loci with irregular internal walls, extending inferiorly towards and into the RLQ.

-After my findings, I discussed the case with the attending hospitalist. He ordered a CT.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Radiology Part 2:
CT: CT of Abdomen and Pelvis was performed. I protocoled the study with the medical physicist and ordered IV contrast agent. Axial and Coronal studies were performed.  

Contrast Enhanced CT study; MY FINDINGS: multiloculated cystic mass with significant septal enhancement and calcification. Wall of lesion had two primary loci of punctiform calcification. Measured out to be 10x7x9 in longitudinal, AP, and Transverse Ø. Mass seemed to originate from the gastric antrum. Lymphadenopathy was discovered along the lateral surface of the stomach.

Following my report, I discussed with hospitalist and we agreed that he should order a MRI
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Radiology Part 3:
MRI: Abdominal MRI was ordered. Once again, I protocoled the study with the MP and ordered a IV-GBCA. MRI was ordered to further evaluate relationship between mass and organs. 

GBCA enhanced MRI study: Loculi were expectedly better defined. Dimensions of loculi were highly variable.  Loculi fluid contact was hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2. Internal septa were isodense on T2 and unenhanced on T1. Continued enhanced lymphadenopathy was discovered along the lateral surface of the stomach. No invasion into surrounding organs, no invasion into surrounding vessels No other lesions found.

However, at times I still have doubts. The time I spent on ortho was the best part of my clerkship: I love the variety, the MSK anatomy, the OR and how well your patients do after. 

But - I also find that I like a lot of other things: for example I had a great time on my emerg rotation. I got very tired of chest pain, drug seekers and people who just weren't sick - but I didn't hate it! Same with many other medicine type rotations. The biggest thing I liked - the fact that you KNOW stuff - if a patient asks you a question about their meds or condition you know enough general info to be able to guide them.

A lot of the orthopods I've met at my hospital know very little medicine. Many of the residents get me to read the ECGs for patients since I'm better than they are! I find that is the only little grain of doubt in my mind: will I get bored and be unsatisfied if I don't have those skills anymore?

pharmacy,Pharmacist's rights (retail),"I have not worked chain retail in 18 months. I've recently been at an HIV specialty pharmacy and in a non dispensing role (not retail). 

However, I think it is time. It is time for retail pharmacist in every state to be guaranteed lunch and bathroom breaks. Also it is time to guarantee a certain number of tech hours to RX count ratio (that also accounts for vaccinations). It should be such that pharmacists are never at a register, especially the drive through and that they have enough time to counsel on new prescriptions (as many state law requires but is ignored). These are basic work rights and I would bet our patients' think we have these protections. 

I'm shocked that noone has started an effort (outside of California) to do this. It is relatively simple to crush the chains. They can not import labor from another state. Even 2 days of loss prescriptions would be a massive loss for them. A PR campaign would be crushing. 

I think I'm ready to be a part of this. Maybe the head of this. I think the way to do it is to pick a state and show it can be done in one state. Then bring to another and another. 

This doesn't directly affect me anymore but after working for companies that treat me as a professional, I can tell you I'm a happier person who feels better about himself. The qol status quo seems to be designed to inhibit demanding respect. If they gave a little pharmacist might demand even more. We have to demand ALOT (though that wouldn't be more than is reasonable if progression of the retail profession hadn't been held back for decades) Pharmacy chains are extraordinarily profitable. There is no excuse for this.

I want to hear responses and I want to start this. Maybe we can start with a website then pick a state and target retail pharmacists and students in that state. It doesn't have to be a union but it can be a membership for reasonable work standards. This can happen.

Sorry---I responded on another account who had been logged into my computer to many of your comments (Eachmanaking)

medicine,ECG of the day #6,"Will try to keep the trend of clinical cases going.

Young man in his mid 20s, no significant medical history except for a current tobacco smoker presents with syncope.  Was strolling in a park and had smoked a cigarette 15 minutes prior to the episode.  Suddenly he felt ""dizzy""  and clarifies this to mean the room was spinning and he felt unsteady.  Tried to walk to his car and collapsed, suffering a posterior scalp hematoma/laceration.  Some possible jerking reported by witnesses, no tongue biting or incontinence.  Subsequent history not great as it comes second hand through medics via witnesses, but around 3-5 minutes later eyes were open, he was tracking and coughing but not responding to questions.  By the time the medics arrived, perhaps 10-15 min after the collapse he was conversant and has some (but not perfect) memories of things since then.

[Here is his ECG on presentation to the ER](https://imgur.com/xSRmVCu)

EDIT:  To save time I'll tell you that in the ED vitals were unremarkable including normal SpO2, HR in the 100s initially but trended down. Labs and imaging in the ER were unremarkable, including cardiac enzymes, CMP, CBC with differential.  CXR, CT head without contrast and CT C-spine were also unremarkable.

So I've done these case reports a couple different ways here: from giving everything up front and letting people discuss whatever to doing things more structured and proceeding piecemeal after answering additional questions (like giving additional history, labs, exam, etc...).  The latter is fun but takes a lot of time so what I think I'll do with this is just ask **how do you interpret his ECG, what additional history, labs, tests do you want and what is your differential.**

pharmacy,Just trying to release some steam...,"In no particular order, here are things I really wish I could tell people about their medications:

- Okay, idiot, if you are going to INSIST on saying you are ""allergic"" to Vicodin (despite really just getting an upset stomach), we're going to take you literal and assume you mean you are ""allergic"" to both hydrocodone and acetaminophen!  So that means no OTC cold medications for you!  You're doubled over in pain and the ER doc wrote you a RX for Percocet, nope, we're sending you back because it has Tylenol in it, which you say you're allergic to!

- No, we are not shorting you on your Xalatan!  2.5ml is a small amount of liquid and the bottle is oversized.  There should be 50 drops in it, and you are only using it in your left eye!  So, you should have enough the last 7 weeks!

- Hmmm, when we can see through the drive thru window that you have to be driven by somebody else as you can barely fit in the back seat of the minivan while wearing a seat-belt extender, maybe, you should accept the fact when your Levemir pen dose only lasts 2.5 days (and requires 2 dialed injections to give) you should accept the fact that you need to just learn to use the vials and syringes, so we don't need a seperate mini-fridge to stock enough of that and your Novolog pens as to not run out for other customers!

- Grandma Nutjob, I know you're old enough that generics didn't exist when you started all your medications, but if I blindfolded you and told you I was giving you your brand name medications, you would never know the difference.  If you are being literal and can only take brand products, then why do you have the GENERIC butter and GENERIC potato chips in your grocery cart?!  That bottled water is the store brand, which is in itself a GENERIC!  Geez!  

Things I wish I could tell doctors and their staff:

- Doctor Dumbass, you know your patient is in a skilled nursing facility and is likely never going to leave!  The patient only has access to her Lortab when the nurses give it to them.  So, despite prescribing it to be given Q4H around the clock, why do you refuse to write for a quantity greater than 60 tabs, when 180 tabs is a month supply?! It's so much fun when the nurses don't do their job and wait until Sunday afternoon to freak out because the patient is out and we can't get ahold of you!  Jerk!

- Dear Dr. Jackoff, if you're the on call provider dishing out telephone narcotic orders at 9pm on a Saturday to some uneducated nurse at a skilled nursing facility, could you please call us at the long term care pharmacy to give us the verbal emergency RX right after that.  Otherwise, you don't get to act pissed off, when we have to call you at 3am, because all the staff member did was fax us a copy of the transcribed order and waited until then to bitch about why the medication hasn't magically arrived yet!

- Along those lines, fuck you Dr. Dipshit!  You were on site at the facility today.  You obliged the nurse's request to change the strength and/or directions of their narcotic pain or anxiety medication.  Could you spare 5 brain cells to remember that writing new narc orders in a skilled nursing facility IS NOT the same as when you were a resident at the hospital.  Could you be kind and write a quantity next to the order and your signature, so we have a legal RX and don't have to wake you or the chump you got to work on-call for you at 2AM because the idiot nurses don't get we need some form of prescription to send narcotics!   

Things I wish I could tell the nurses at skilled nursing facilities:

- There's this thing called math!  When your director of nursing only allows us to send you a card of 30 doses for narcotics (because she doesn't trust the staff because of theft), and some dipshit doctor who doesn't seem to believe in long-acting opioids only gives your post surgery resident Hydromorphone 2mg 1 PO q3h while awake, you morons need to request a refill when half the card is gone.  Don't wait until Saturday night at 1am (when the last dose is given) to finally order when the last drug delivery of the week was Saturday afternoon!  Geez!  The $150 courier cost to STAT it out is coming out of your paycheck, you twat!

- Um, nurse, just to remind you, you work at an assisted living facility.  For all intents, the residents are outpatient according to insurance.  So, just because you get a progress note from doctor visit for Granny Oldfart with some med changes, I need a fucking prescription to send your resident their fucking drugs, mmmmkay?  Oh, and when they get an antibiotic RX, the resident is not going to die if they have to wait until the contracted delivery time at 8pm.  We are not going to eat the $100 courier cost, but will gladly forward the cost to you if you insist it can't wait!  In the real world, people take a couple hours off a work to go to their doctor, get the RX called/e-scribed to their pharmacy, and wait until the end of the day to pick it up.  Your residents are no more special than anyone else and can wait.  If it was life threatening, they'd be in the hospital, you putz!

- You know, lets be realistic, you've had the 43 discharge orders for this patient since 10am, but you're facility policy is that you can't send them to us at the long term care pharmacy to fill until the patient is in the door!  Don't be assholes and insist that we need to call out a first dose on all their late afternoon and evening medications!  We're grateful enough that you faxed the orders to us 2 minutes before your contracted cutoff time to have them on the normal scheduled delivery rather than have to eat the $200 delivery cost because you are located in the boonies at the very asscrack bottom of the state, with no local pharmacies around.  I'm sorry that the unrealistic state board imposes the same fines for late administration of medications to patients in a skilled nursing facility that are equal in severity to the hospital, but, since you are 175 miles away, and you allow admits at night, your medication delivery is not going to come until almost 1AM most of the time!  Get a damn standing order that covers your ass that states you are to give medications when available!  The 1 hour difference that first dosing all these damn medications is inconsequential!  Teleportation technology doesn't exist, so suck it up!  

- While we're at it, fuck you for taking IV medication orders!  At most the way you talk, it sounds like maybe one nurse on staff is even qualified to safely administer IVs (and I'm soooo sure you follow sterile procedures when setting them up, too, uh-huh!)  I'm pretty sure the moron resident you called after-hours has no clue that skilled nursing facilities are the land of clueless travel nurses and those who graduated last in their class (and have been blacklisted as unhirable by hospitals), so you really should be sending them back to the hospital that moment.  

- Furthermore, don't be derps with patients that have standing IV orders!  If your delivery arrived at 5PM and a fresh round of half a week of IV meds didn't arrive in it, don't wait until 1AM to scream at us (3 hours after that next dose of Vancomycin 1.75g q8h was due) demanding we instantly produce some STAT!  The sad-sack on-call pharmacist is going to have to come in, and needs an hour and a half to produce a 48 hour supply because your nurses are so inept, the only safe way you can allow IVs to be given is via Eclipse pumps (before we can even call a courier to pick it up and deliver to your facility 120 miles away!!)  You'll get our sympathy once you have crab claw hands from having to draw up 250ml of NS and IV push into a Eclipse pump 6 times over!",19,31,2016-06-10,PHARMA,0.08189160749316216,0.8921011388301849,0.0260072099044919

medicine,"Case reports, non-randomized studies on patients adamantly refusing surgery for advanced rectal cancers","Our clinic currently has 6 patients with fairly advanced T3N2M0 rectal cancers who are refusing treatment. Typically we see such patients again in the ER when they obstruct because they refuse all forms of treatment, usually on religious grounds or because of their advanced age. However I was wondering if there might be case reports or non-randomized studies on patients who adamantly refuse only surgery for their rectal cancers. A quick pubmed search didn't pull up any relevant studies but I am afraid I may have missed something or not used the relevant search terms. If you are aware of any such reports or have anecdotal data to share about your clinic's experiences, we would love to hear them. Also, what would be a good outlet to publish such a case study, should we decide to write up one?",26,25,2016-06-14,PHARMA,0.03373640403151512,0.9365447759628296,0.029718885198235512
medicine,The non-pulm critical care pathway?,"As some of you may know, there are certain IM subspecialties for which completion of a fellowship with adequate ICU time allows the physician to pursue a distinct critical care fellowship for 1 year instead of 2.  So, for example, if you did an ID fellowship that had the required amount of ICU time (and procedures) built into it, you would then be able to complete one year of a CC fellowship and be able to sit for the exam, instead of doing it for two years. This is not an integrated dual fellowship like the pulm/CC pathway, though. It's kind of like a DIY approach with the same concept.

My question is, would any ICU's want to hire such a professional? Would any groups hire one, for that matter? I know a few big centers have places like Onc-ICUs and CCUs, but would they realistically want to hire a Heme-Onc-Intensivist or Cards-Intensivist over the standard Pulm/CC doc? 

As for lifestyle, would it be much different balancing inpatient ICU and outpatient specialty clinic than the way the pulm/CC docs do it? Are the outpatient demands of cancer, cardiac, or GI patient panels somehow more rigorous than those of pulmonology?

I know training time is important, but for argument's sake let's say I didn't care about the additional year. And as for difficulty in finding a distinct CC fellowship, I've been told a lot of pulm/CC programs will be willing to work with you, so that wouldn't really be the biggest con of this plan. I'm more interested in learning about feasibility in this path as a career, and its lifestyle. Are any of you this sort of doctor?",12,22,2016-06-14,PHARMA,0.027091069146990776,0.9355151653289795,0.03739384561777115

medicine,"Emergent aortic dissection surgery went well, but with poor outcome. EKG picture/discussion","Just looking for some discussion on this as a CVSICU RN. 

Background:

Patient flown in for emergent aortic dissection. If I remember correctly, it was about 7 or 8cm. They were taken from helicopter immediately to the OR. 

Case was going routinely with an axillary cannulation for bypass. During the repair, the root ruptures, requiring them to circ arrest. Circ arrest was for about 25 minutes while repairs/grafts were made for the ruptured part, then case proceeded relatively normally for the rest of the dissection. No issues coming off pump, although the pump run was pretty long (about 7 hours in the OR). I forgot the exact pump/cross clamp times.

Patient came up on propofol and phenylephrine. Not requiring a lot of either. Wasn't like they're maxed on epi/milrinone/vaso ect. Just prop and Neo

Patient was paced with 2a/2v wires, which was set as DOO. Anesthesia did not know what the underlying rhythm was. Per protocol (which we are now changing as of today), we paused the epicardial pacer. Which is when [this](http://imgur.com/mXMh6gz) happens. 

As you can see, the patient was, what appears to be asystolic underneath, or severely bradicardic. Pacer was plugged back in, and it captured properly for at least one additional beat judging by the arterial line. However, that beat appears to have possibly created an escape beat/PVC. The pacer fired off again, and appears to have hit 'R on T', throwing them into v-fib. We ended up cracking the chest at the bedside, thinking that there was some kind of rupture again inside when they went into v-fib (didn't see the possible R on T during everything). Cardiac massage, internal defibrillation 

Some additional background: The patient was an elderly male. His EF was 80%. *However*, that 80% EF was because the patients ventricle was so hypertrophic, that the entire stroke volume was about 10-25ml. So while his heart was pumping with an EF of 80%, the actual volume moving was pretty shitty. 

Just looking for discussion on this because during rounds today our surgeons/PAs were pretty skeptical about if it was actually a R on T phenomenon, or if the patient's heart was so weak that after the pacer was restarted, it got 1 good beat before going off into v-fib. I'm a little skeptical on that, as it is pretty clear that the pacer captured properly at least one. What I think happened is that it fired off, got a beat, and it seems the patient had either a PVC or some kind of escape beat where the pacer fired off and hit the T wave, throwing them into vfib. 

Sorry this is a little 'rambly'. It is my 4th day in a row. Luckily (although I love me some bedside sternotomy situations) I wasn't there for this, as it was night shift after I left, but just want some outside opinions/discussions on it so I can possibly bring back some ideas/concerns for M&amp;M and rounds.",27,38,2016-06-15,PHARMA,0.09501749277114868,0.8735825419425964,0.0313999280333519

medicine,When is it appropriate to treat someone with metformin for prediabetes.,"So i was having a heated discussion with one of my friends who is a GP/internist.This scenario is completely hypothetical. When would you want to start someone who is an athlete or just in very good shape who is showing signs of insulin resistance. My scenario was this, Male in mid 20s about 26 who exercises regularly and eats healthy but is having symptoms of diabetes such as 3 ps. FBG is 96 and HbA1c is 5.4 just below pre diabetic range but is controlling it through diet and exercise. He also has FH of non obese related diabetes to healthy parents. 


My argument is that the PT is definelty showing signs of insulin resistance and needs to be put on preventative measures for diabetes since his lifestyle modifications are maxed out. This person will develop diabetes no matter what in the long term so why not start him on metformin right away. 

My friends argument was to not start unlill he hits an HbA1c of &gt;6 regardless of FBG. I personally think this is too late. 



What are your opinions on this? there are no specific guidelines as to what to do in a scenario like this. With diabetes becoming more prevalent in society its important to look at some of these odd scenarios.",12,19,2016-06-16,PHARMA,0.02706035226583481,0.9288002252578735,0.044139426201581955

medicine,I AM THE Law!,"I work in a busy big city ER, and due to our sometimes incredibly high volumes our wait times can get a little long. 
All the staff, nurses and docs including my self try to be very apologetic about this when this happens and explain the situation to patients.

However, one night on my overnight shift where it was again busy as hell in our acute area, I finally make it over to our ambulatory area. It's busy but wait times aren't too horrible. I start seeing people with the usual sorry for the wait etc... 

Then as I'm writing up a chart for a patient I just finished seeing,  I see this young woman probably mid 20s, going off on the hospital and staff, how horrible we are, how long they have been waiting, how no one cares, how sick her brother is how they should just leave and go somewhere else. So I casually say to the nurse beside me but I guess loud enough for the lady to hear , that if they feel that way they are free to leave. 

This apparently set off a second explosion from this lady,  how it's her right to be in the hospital, that the government pays for this place and she's a Canadian and lot of other stuff. Fine whatever I just ignore her as the nurses try to deal with her, but as they try to go to speak to her, she lets if this one aimed at me,  ""you just work here, you're just an employee, you can't speak to me like that"" 

I don't know what happened, maybe it was the multiple shifts in a  row of extreme volume but I snapped. I started to walk up to her and said ""Mam I'm The Doctor here. I have no problem seeing and treating your brother but if you continue to behave in this manner I will call security and I well get you forcibly removed if necessary . "" (this is very harsh for my standard, I'm more of a kill'em with kindness type of person) 

She booked it to her brothers room and a few minutes later her brother, the patient came to apologize.

medicine,Doctors of Meddit - What to do when approaching an anti-vaxxer,"So a close friend of mine has shared this website:

http://mumbabymagazine.com/now-its-official-fda-admits-that-vaccines-indeed-cause-autism/

They are also sharing all sorts of details about how their child will not be vaccinated, etc etc.

So my question: Does anyone have any good tips on how to provide convincing evidence to them that the vaccines are beneficial, do not cause autism, are not some big conspiracy and the like without immediately triggering the ""You are one of them you don't get to tell me what to do"" reaction, without simply telling them about the hundreds of studies that show the safety and efficacy? 

I am sure that once I get through and qualify I am going to meet more and more of these people and as it stands I have no clue about how to approach this topic. The few times I have the responses ranged from ""You don't have children, you do not know what it is like"" to the absolutely preposterous claims that I am an agent of Big Pharma (which, I would like to add... surely that means I am supposed to get paid for that yet I never see a single cheque!).

Obviously I do not want to brow beat someone, insult them, or insinuate anything like that. I only want to help or at the least give useful suggestions and direction.

pharmacy,"Give me your opinions about the decision of a pharmacy to substitute Mallinckrodt's version of ""Concerta"" for my girlfriend despite the BX listing on Orange book. I am in the middle of a dispute with our pharmacy and I think something is wrong here.","Ok, long story short: 

My girlfriend takes concerta. Her MD writes a script as ""concerta"" and says that generic substitution is ok. She normally receives the ""Alza"" generic, but recently was given Mallinckrodt's version. She mentioned to me over the weekend that it wasn't working, and she was concerned. I'm in healthcare and while not a pharmacist, I am plenty knowledgeable on most of this stuff. I took a look at saw that this med has been listed as BX on the Orange book, and not AB. I did more research and it seemed as if most people indicate that this is not an ok substitution given the way the script was written. 

I called the local pharmacy and they said they wouldn't take it back and reissue the correct med. I called my friend who is a pharmacist and has also been a manager in the retail setting and he immediately said that our pharmacy handled this incorrectly and that in his old retail setting it was their policy to only dispense AB-listed generics when the script said ""concerta"". He said he would take it back as a med error and dispense new medication. He then verified this with two other pharmacy managers at similar institutions. 

Today I called the person that manages this area for QFC, which is the grocery store and pharmacy in question. He was insanely dismissive and arrogant, and said that this is all ""an interpretation"" and that it's great that these other places have a policy but that's their business and not a reflection of best practice. He then began to lecture me on what AB-rated bioequivalency means, although I told him I have a good understanding of the terms and I know damn well we're talking 80-120% and nothing is perfect. He asked me ""So, do you think 80-120% is bioequivalent? It doesn't sound exactly perfect to me."" I simply said that I think he's right, that it is a wide range, but we're comparing AB to BX and not AB to brand name so I don't understand why that matters. He then said ""Well this BX med could even be better, right?"". That, to me, was an indication that something is very wrong here. He's defending their practice by saying the BX med COULD be better. He told me that while my friend and his colleagues say they should have taken it back as a med error (or, DFI as some referred to it as), he doesn't think that makes any sense and that it is not their fault at all. He also said he didn't appreciate me ""bad-mouthing"" QFC by relating this story to other pharmacists, to which I replied that I simply told them exactly what happened, so if there is embarrassment over this issue that they need to look internally at their policies. 

Sorry for this rant, but I want to know a few things: 

* What would you do personally in this situation? Is this really much of a grey area or do you think that there's a clearly defined answer? 

* Is this situation clearly dictated by a law? 

* If you were me, how heavily would you pursue this in terms of the principle of the issue? At this point we'll have her MD re-write a script and hopefully get it to another pharmacy, but now I'm at the point where the initial decision of QFC coupled with their response and attitude is making me consider contacting the board and reporting these actions. 

Thank you for any input, even if it's to tell me I'm just plain wrong!

Edit: So, Washington is not an Orange book state. This does at least give QFC's approach some validation, as they aren't breaking the law from what I can tell.

medicine,"AI, Computers, and the future of radiology[and medicine]","Hello Everyone. Over the past 2 weeks or so, I've gotten over 30 direct messages(mainly from medical students, but some from surgeons, internists etc.) about what I think will be happening to radiology in the future. Apparently i've made quite the media footprint in the meddit community lol. While I could respond to all 30 of their questions, I felt it was easier to culminate them in a post, and also open up a debate of sorts. It could be interesting!
________________________________________
Here is my opinion of AI as a radiologist. And this is coming from someone who has worked with IBM Watson, and has a solid knowledge base on the topic. First of all, I want you all to keep and open mind. I'll admit, to medical students who want to join radiology, you are right to have some fear. AI does have the ability to take up some of the minutiae of radiology. The minutiae will easily be replaced by AI since it really doesn't require a MD to do. Such as finding lung nodules and measuring them(waste of resources). AI is getting very good at that. AI is also improving CAD and getting better at analyzing breast densities qualitatively and having high sensitivities for where to biopsy. On the other hand, AI is very bad at things that require a good knowledge of medical physics, anatomy and a good eye etc. Such as differentiating cystic from normal tissue in MRI or CT even. In other words, the future of radiology will be in doing things that require a higher cognitive ability then measuring something. So in the end, will there be less need for radiology? Yes. However there will still be significant need. Radiologists have to learn that AI is not the enemy. It is something we have to accept, and learn to work with. There are some computer programs recently that are getting better at analyzing some neuroradiologic presentations. For example, analyzing neurodegenerative diseases is primarily qualitative, measuring volumetric changes, and width changes in certain areas of the brain. A computer will easily be able to do that in 10 years. 
_________________________________________
As you can see, computers are better at SOME tasks, primarily qualitative ones. So what can radiologists do? Radiologists need and are shifting their concerns. PACS was easily the best and worst thing to happen to radiology. PACS exponentially increased our ability to read imaging. It also gave clinicians the ability to read imaging in the wards(not a bad thing). What happened was the clinician-radiologist relationship became diminished. Clinicians read the report, rarely talk to radiologists unless necessary. The days when clinicians came down to the reading room for a Q&amp;A that benefited patient care is over. What radiologists need to do is bring our skills to the clinic. Diagnostic radiologists need to go the wards, work with internists, neurologists, surgeons more. We need to be part of the team. We can't sit in the reading room and expect ALL of us to keep our jobs. AI will likely replace about 20-40% of what radiologists do in the reading room(I emphasize in the reading room). But radiologists still understand radiology better then anyone else. We need to understand as do clinicians that radiologists bring a different perspective, a new perspective to the wards. Watch a radiologist do a bedside ultrasound vs a ER doc. It is not about which is better about reading imaging(although I think it is obvious who is), it is about what we bring to the table. We analyze things differently, view things differently. We see more and understand more and can communicate that it in different ways to the diagnostic situation. IR docs are thinking the right way. A good IR doc brings his radiology skills to the clinic, albeit in a more therapeutic way. Diagnostic radiologists need to bring out skill set to the clinic. We can't be clinic-phobes. Or some may or will lose their jobs. If we are going to be honest, lots of doctors(I'd estimate between 10-30%) are going to be losing their jobs over the next 100 years. We need to improve and learn and work with AI. We need to improve what we bring to the table. Why don't PhDs lose their jobs, they are creative! We need to be creative too. We can't just sit on the sidelines. 
_________________________________________________
Radiologists have to being to think and be viewed as assets. We need to think of ourselves as a consulting service and act like one. Reading imaging in the way we do is useful, but we can and need to do better. I recently have been working on improving MRI machines to analyze lesions. Such as once we find a cancer, we can focus the MRI on the cancer and take 100 slices of the cancer itself, see more and do more for surgeons in resection. That is a small example of how personalized medicine will improve radiology. But outside of those reasonings. There are some obvious legal reasons such as medical mal practice, legislation allowing for AI diagnosis.

PS. I hope those who asked me questions, they were answered. And to those reading, I hope you enjoyed and I hope you may use this information in your practice. Clinicians, I hope you can maybe encourage radiologists coming into the clinic and not scrutinize them. I have gone into the clinic despite huge stigma, and i've definitely improved patient care. I hope you all can view us as an asset, not deadweight. To  medical students. I want to emphasize, radiology as a field is just getting started, we are opening up new pathways, being creative. Don't be scared, be cautious. In the future of radiology, it is likely the lazy(aka those only willing to sit on their ass, not go the extra mile) will be weeded out. Just because we sit in a chair does not mean you can be lazy. Thank you for your time everyone!

medicine,"Cannabidiol, a major phytocannabinoid, as a potent atypical inhibitor for CYP2D6.","With medicinal cannabis on the increase and more people using the drug this is something that I believe could prove significant in prescribing decisions for patients. Many people are also starting to use CBD oil (non-psychoactive) as a nutritional/alternative supplement.

Cannabidiol (CBD, a molecule in cannabis) is a potent inhibitor of the CYP2D6 enzyme[1]. 

[1] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21821735

Many of the CYP2D6 substrates have deleterious side effects at above therapeutic blood concentrations, and can also be quite delicate in the dosage decisions that are made. This could prove significant in the reactions that patients have to medications. The patient's use of cannabis or CBD oil type products appears to be a significant factor to be taken into consideration when prescribing CYP2D6 substrates.",7,30,2016-06-23,PHARMA,0.03786848857998848,0.9267734885215759,0.035357944667339325

medicine,"David Newman, ER doc accused of sexually assaulting multiple patients, back in court today. Prosecution says he used propofol.","When this story broke in January, there was a fair amount of incredulity/skepticism in this subreddit. A few months later, when it came to light that he had told detectives that the reason his semen was on the patient's face was that he had masturbated in the staff lounge before examining her and must not have washed his hands, it seems like opinion started to shift against him, but there were still questions about how he could have pulled it off. If he used propofol rather than morphine, that would seem to address some of the logistical questions. 

Four accusers have come forward. I wonder how many other women were assaulted by him but have no idea because he successfully sedated them. My guess is that this is not the sort of crime a person botches the first few times he does it -- he gets caught when he becomes sloppy and arrogant.

medicine,Help designing a class for high school students!,"Hello guys,

Long story short, I have been drafted in to teach some high school students an introductory course in medical science for a few weeks. It was very, very last minute and I'm leaving to start in two days.

I would really, really appreciate advice on what topics you think would be good to cover over 4 weeks! Any practicals or demonstrations I could run? Any memories of good lessons if your own that I could try and emulate to some degree? What would you want from this course?

Help me reddit, you're my only hope.

pharmacy,I got written up by my retail store manager for denying loaners on a controlled medication,"As the title says, the store manager of the grocery store that my pharmacy (I'm just a tech) I work in wrote me up. Not a super big deal because I can get allowed 2 write ups before I'm placed on ""probation"", but both my PIC and I are pissed about it.

It's 30 minutes before closing and only me and the PIC working, she steps out for a minute to use the restroom. When she's gone a lady runs up panting saying she needs to pickup her Rx that her doctor was suppose to call in for her clonazepam. I checked the system and the doctor denied our refill request earlier today saying ""new Rx to follow"". I told her this and that he was probably gonna change the script some and that he just hasn't sent a new one yet. She immediately started freaking out and saying that's not right and blah blah blah.

She then wanted loaners because we gave her loaners before for her cholesterol medication in the past, and I told her we can't do that for controls. She then freaked out even more and starting yelling saying she was going into withdraw and was having shakes. I ask her if I should call 911 and get some help and she snaps back at me saying ""not to call shit"" and that this is my fault. I said I can't do anything to help her right now and that if she's concerned for her health to go to an emergency room and see a doctor. I explained as much as I wish I could help her, I am not allowed to give her any loaners until I get a new prescription from her doctor.

She storms off and apparently bitched to a manager about me. When the PIC comes back I explained what happened and she said that that was unfortunate situation to be in, but that I did exactly what I was suppose to. Store manager (who's a huge tryhard, ass-kissing kinda guy) strolls up at 9:00 when we close and starts lecturing me on how I was supposedly being ""inconsiderate and empathetic"" with the lady and how that was unacceptable. He wrote me and made me sign it.

PIC got onto him saying I did everything I was suppose to and that it was unfair I was getting in trouble, to which Store Manager says that I may have followed what I was suppose to do legally, but in the process of doing so I wasn't putting the customer first and understanding their complaints and feelings....

What the fuck. Complete bullshit. I wasn't once rude or mean, and I did everything in my power to help her. She wanted something that I couldn't legally do, and since I told her no she goes and complains to the manager who then writes me up? That's some bullshit right there.

Rant over. I don't care too much about it, just think it's pretty dumb  how that happened.",44,82,2016-06-30,PHARMA,0.1112685427069664,0.8626810908317566,0.02605038322508335
medicine,Bad idea to go far away for residency if you want to come back home afterwards?,"MS3 here.  I'm pretty confident that I want to practice in my home state.  The thing is, residency seems like a nice set ""block of time"" to go experience something different and live across the country, down the coast, something like that.   Would this at all be a disadvantage when I eventually come back and look for a job?  In other words, should I consider staying in the area as a resident to build connections, etc?
