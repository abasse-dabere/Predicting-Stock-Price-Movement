medicine,A short history lesson on something you may not know. The Durham Humphrey amendment. A law that destroyed one profession and allowed another to thrive.,"Many of you are probable unaware of this amendment and what it did. Before 1951 Pharmacists where allowed to prescribe and compound any medication without a prescription from an MD. this bill created 2 types of medications OTC and legend drugs. Legend drugs would need a prescription from an MD and could no longer be sold by a pharmacist without one.  This bill was the very catalyst that increased Physicians salary's by over 200% in just a few years. 

The funny thing about this law is it was created by 2 ex pharmacists turned politicians as a political move to get campaign funding. 


Also this is not a post in support of pharmacists having prescribing rights. its just a quick history lesson that most of you most likely have never heard of and how it shaped your profession",42,159,2016-09-04,PHARMA,0.031521860510110855,0.934946596622467,0.033531539142131805

medicine,"How to talk to parents who refuse immunization, according to 1,100+ physicians and nurses","Hi everyone, I wanted to share the results of a recent survey we conducted with physicians and nurses at Figure 1. **Full disclosure: I'm a co-founder.**


Here's some info that isn't published in our post. We asked, **""Some healthcare professionals refuse to treat unvaccinated children at their practice. Where do you stand?”**, and:


* 30% said they do support this practice
* 13% don’t support it at all
* 26% said they don’t support it but can empathize
* and 31% were neutral (it's up to the practitioner)


We also asked, ""What supporting arguments have you used to educate them and/or change their mind?""


* **“Discuss the risk of severe” illness was the most popular choice (78%)**
* followed by “Discuss the risk to vulnerable patients” (62%)
* “Refer to evidence-based studies” (53%)
* “Discuss the science of immunization” (42%)
* “Explain herd immunity” (42%), and 
* “Appeal to emotion with anecdotes” (16%)
* We also gave the option for “Other” (2%)


One more interesting number: **only 3% of respondents said they had never met a parent who refused immunization.**


I wanted to know if these results match your experience, or if you have anything to add.

My previous degree was in Athletic Training and I was just wondering what are the best ways to gain respect from the medical professionals that I will be working with when I graduate?

I am not looking for advice like get your degree in physical therapy or don't practice... I am hoping to get advice as to what would personally help you respect an individual physician and what would be the best way to go about providing what you are looking for?

Also as secondary questions 

* What ""turns you off"" of a chiropractor? 

* What would it take for you to gain respect for the profession as a whole?

EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone that commented and for the civil discussion as a whole.

 Also in what many of you may take as a personal victory I have personally decided to discontinue performing cervical manipulations as the evidence is inconclusive for it helping and was greatly overstated in my education even though I still believe the evidence connecting the risks behind chiropractic care and carotid artery dissection to be even more inconclusive.

pharmacy,PSA to ALL pharmacists - you rock! (a reply of sorts to the most controversial post on this subreddit),"Sometimes for fun I like to view the most popular and controversial posts in a subreddit for ""all time"". The most controversial post here is a similarly titled post by a ""pain management patient"" (which I actually am) https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/2imvv6/psa_to_all_pharmacists_just_because_i_am_a/

It seems they were a ""problem patient"" and blaming the pharmacist. It kinda rubbed me the wrong way and I wanted to offer a different perspective. Maybe I've just been lucky, but I've never had ANY issues - even though I'm a male in my 20s who picks up 120x Norco 7.5 every month (along with a bunch of other stuff). Even though I go to a chain (Walgreens), I always go to the same store and I've formed a relationship with the staff and we get along great. The only thing I've ever ""needed"" of them is having them hold my Norco prescription (my prescriber e-files) for 24 hours when I had a family emergency and had to rush out of town - and they didn't have any problem with that. Other than that, I come in once again month after they call me and tell me it's ready and I pick up exactly what the doctor prescribed, pay with my insurance, and leave. Imagine that! 

As a chronic pain patient I hate being on opiates but I need them to function. I don't always look like I'm in extreme pain but that's because the medication is working. I think most of you understand that, though. I distinctly remember overhearing my pain management doctor have a consult with a new patient (loud talker + thin walls. It would have been hilarious if it wasn't such a serious problem. It went something like:

* Patient ""yeah, I was in a car accident and my back really hurts."" 
* Doctor ""OK, I'll prescribe you some tramadol and ibuprofen and we'll see how you handle that"" 
* Patient ""well, I'm allergic to ibuprofen, and in the ER they gave me something that worked real well - what was it.. Um... Oxy... Oxycodone? Maybe we could try some of that?"".

It was so crazy actually hearing someone try that. I can't imagine what that's like dealing with the ones that slip through the cracks. I was on NSAIDs until I got ulcers and only went off them begrudgingly because they really helped my joint pain. I just had another endoscopy and while my GI doctor still doesn't want me back on them, he thinks ""a low dose will probably because OK"" - which is great to hear. Actual PM patients want to be normal not to be high all the time - but again you probably all know that.

At the same time, I get really scared. Due to the abuse we seem to be in an ""opiate madness"" craze right now, and sometimes it feels like the government / the medical institution is erring too far on the other side sometimes. I've been fortunate to have no issues but over at /r/chronicpain there are some people who have had been made to suffer by their doctors and pharmacists. So do keep it in mind that for those of us who legitimately need this medication it's often the only way we can go to work, clean our houses, or even get out of bed.

Anyway, I just wanted to give you guys some positive feedback.",23,55,2016-09-08,PHARMA,0.13263866305351257,0.8397700786590576,0.027591178193688393

medicine,What do y'all think about the claims of 9/11 first responders?,"[I'm writing because of an article I recently came across.](https://www.corbettreport.com/911-suspects-christine-todd-whitman/) Whenever I read about the illnesses of the 9/11 rescue workers, I'm filled with skepticism. The reports are always filled with stories of personal hardships and out-of-context numbers. I can't see why anyone would write that way except to mislead their reader.

I'm an Australian doctor and I have a degree in pharmacology, and the damning '19%' increase in cancers quoted in the linked article isn't necessarily a big difference. This is a population with only a moderate base rate of cancer, so any outliers can significantly shift the data. A 19% variance from the norm may well represent, or be largely due to sampling bias. Similarly the man mentioned in the article who has to take 33 pills each morning and was on home oxygen seems dubious. I'm not even sure that there are 33 unique oral medicines for COAD, and I've never seen a patient so over medicated unless they were deliberately seeking more medicines for non-medical reasons.

The levels of air contamination they've quoted are very hard to interpret. Were these one-off measures or averaged over an hour or a day? How did these measures compare to the average over the surrounding test stations? Are the max exposure limits they quote for long term or short term exposure?

I think first responders' medical issues should be covered by the city because it's simply good manners, but I don't think the claims of poor health really stand up to scientific scrutiny.

medicine,The real reason why Cigna released the commercial to bring patients in for annual physicals.,"The real reason why Cigna wants patients to come in for annual physicals is money.

All the HMO's are being judged on how well they take care of their patients and they are given a star rating.  The rating depends on many factors- [but a large part of it is how frequently their patients get recommended screenings](https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/staticpages/rating/planrating-help.aspx?termId=2016SS3).  Having an annual physical significantly increases screening rates.

[Cigna was going to lose $350 million for having a poor rating](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160309/NEWS/160309838).

In addition, they need to have their patients [""Hierarchical Conditions Categorizes-HCC""](https://www.cms.gov/mmrr/Downloads/MMRR2014_004_03_a03.pdf) assessed at least once a year.  If healthy patients that wouldn't otherwise need medical care get their HCC's assessed it means that the patients Cigna covers are considered sicker, and as a result they would get more money from the government.  

The quality improvement programs in the US usually boil down to trying to make your patients look sicker rather than improving care- because that is a lot easier.   Meanwhile the administrative costs for health care in the US (which are already astronomical) keep on going up.  Accountable care organizations are a great example of this.",37,150,2016-09-11,PHARMA,0.028913071379065514,0.8916678428649902,0.0794190987944603

Tell me a time when something was laugh-worthy but you weren't sure if you should laugh.","I am a MS1 but have done observerships and once shadowed a surgeon working clinic. A patient had a follow-up after a successful mastectomy. After he asked the patient how they were doing, and how everything was healing, she mentioned that she was feeling lonely since, ""for obvious reasons, I'm no longer 'on the market'."" 

It sounded almost like a joke but was just along the line, so I couldn't be sure. I enjoy sarcastic humour but it sounded like she was confessing a serious concern and the context screamed ""DON'T LAUGH"" so I didn't. The physician burst out laughing though and my eyes widened - within 2 minutes of walking into the room and having them lay out their vulnerabilities, I was watching a physician laugh at a patient's situation.

But here's the funny part, after 5 seconds of the patient looking up at the physician laughing, with me cringing off to the side not knowing what to do, they burst into laughter too. The tension vanished. She had been holding back the laughs and we all shared a guffaw at that point.

Obviously, this physician had a rapport with the patient, and obviously there are times where a physician might laugh inappropriately, but I haven't seen enough to know what these interactions look like and how to know when to laugh.

medicine,An Encounter I Had Today (As a Paramedic),"I hope this doesn't come off snobby. I lurk on this sub a lot. I've seen some interesting posts about white coats, what they mean. Anyway this happened at work today.

Working my shift as a paramedic. I get called to a specialty hospital for ""chest pain."" To clarify, this is the type of hospital that will handle certain procedures only, ENT only for example, but if chest pain suddenly occurs they have to call 911. I walk in the exam room to see the patient is wearing a long white coat, which looks to be well seasoned; stains and such. Shit. I don't like when this happens because, while I try to always perform a full assessment, doing so on higher medical professionals is always awkward for me. I know my assessments are much less legit than a real exam. Mainly I just try to cover basic things, and figure out if something really bad is up, or if there's something I should really tell to the RN when I get to triage. But I'm sure doctors feel the same way when I ask them my questions and do my exam as I feel when my non-medical friends/family tell me something like ""nectarines are good for high blood pressure."" 

Anyway, I ask the patient what the issue today is. ""My doctor says I have a blood clot in my chest."" Okay, I say. Can you tell me more about what's going on? ""Yes. It's like the blood won't flow correctly to my lungs.""

I'm being babied. This is no problem. I've been babied before. As long as I can get the patient to appropriate facility safely, I figure my job is complete. Therefore what is going on doesn't really bother me.

We go to the nearest ER, everything is cool. I'm standing around, frankly running the clock out. I overhear the ER doc talking to my patient. What's the problem today, she asks? ""Well it's like I can feel my heart working really hard to pump."" ER doc asks the patient to elaborate. ""Like, I'm tired, and feel real bad, like my heart is working hard."" ER doc says something like, ""Can you explain what you feel like in a different way?"" ""Yeah, it's like my heart is a car, and when you press the gas it won't go.""

KLS: Kleine-Levin Syndrome: met a teenage boy who could do nothing but sleep all day for 2 weeks, x3/ year for 4 years. When he would wake, all he wanted to do was eat and masturbate - hyperphagia and hypersexuality - until he had the urge to sleep again. There was an urgency with his wanting to sleep. Went through family docs/ psychiatrists before confirming with a general internist. His parents were very concerned because he was going to start University soon, but as it stands there aren't many treatments now, maybe except modafinil, which the pt did not tolerate well.

medicine,What are some landmark clinical trials that actually had major flaws that went ignored?,"Last fall when the SPRINT results came in, I thought it seemed strange for a major trial to find something unexpected on a question that has been so thoroughly investigated previously.  Now, it turns out, there was a reason for it - an unconventional means of measuring blood pressure, and one that was not disclosed in the initial paper: http://cardiobrief.org/2016/08/28/cardiologists-thumbs-down-to-sprint/

This got me wondering.  What other major trials are out there, which have altered our collective practice, but which actually had major flaws that should have tempered people's excitement about the results?

For example, in ROCKET-AF (rivaroxaban for AF), the fact that the point-of-care meters for INR measurement in the warfarin arm were defective and ended up being recalled after the study was published.

Or in PARADIGM-HF (Entresto vs. enalapril in heart failure) with its lack of true control arm.

It doesn't mean that these studies' conclusions were necessarily wrong, per se, but rather that they should be taken with a bigger grain of salt.

What are some other studies that we should be reconsidering?",47,51,2016-09-12,PHARMA,0.0836571455001831,0.8809987902641296,0.03534402698278427

medicine,"Adjectives in notes; what is a ""pleasant"" patient to you?","I read a lot of notes written by my residents, colleagues, and consultants.  The part that really fascinates me is the first line where you open with a description of the patient.

Typically this includes a salvo of past medical history elements (i.e. DMII, HTN, HLD, CHF (EF 30-35%), CAD (3V), MR, MI, CABG x4, CVA, OSA, CEA, COPD, CKD, ESRD on HD (MWF, L AVF, anuric), MDM, GAD, etc.), sometimes so long that it earns a paragraph itself.  Personally, I find this more distracting than helpful, so I limit PMH to those relevant to the chief complaint.

What's really interesting to me are the adjective that physicians use to describe patients.  ""Pleasant"" in particular.  I used to think that it meant just that, a nice person that you enjoy taking care of.  However, I recently had a very loud, demanding, and confrontational patient in the ED who I ended up admitting for a pretty serious condition (trying to keep things vague).  

She had a recent diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening condition and was in the ED for a serious complication related to this diagnosis.  Understandably she was frightened and also in severe pain.  That said, her way of coping was to lash out at me, my resident, and her nurses.  She also loudly demanded a meal tray, despite my insistence that she stay NPO in case she needed an urgent procedure (a real possibility given the complaint).  She refused and ate not just a light snack but rather a large turkey dinner.  

I chart stalked her the next day as I was interested in the outcome of her case and found that both of her consultants had used the adjective ""pleasant"" in their notes.  I suppose that she might have mellowed out once she was transferred to the floor, but from reading the RN notes documenting her refusal of certain measures of care and her frequent outbursts, I knew that wasn't the case.

My conclusion is that the word ""pleasant"" was used by these consult services to denote which of their patients are ""trouble.""  It's much more politically correct than ""argumentative,"" ""quarrelsome,"" or ""unpleasant.""  

If you use the word ""pleasant"" in your charts, what does it mean to you?  Do you have other code words that you describe patients with?",89,75,2016-09-14,PHARMA,0.09804320335388184,0.8786049485206604,0.02335183508694172

Today, she shows up at drop off, I'm at production. I turn and say ""I'll be right with you"" (making sure to acknowledge immediately, since I'm sure she's the one at home pounding away those negative surveys, but I digress)

""Jane"" responds: no thanks, I want to speak to the real pharmacist. 
Me (sweet as pie): Ok, HE'LL be right with you. 

PIC goes over there. My pic is literally the nicest man I've ever met. He genuinely cares about people and he will spend as much time as needed to counsel, etc. He asks her how he can help.

Jane: (slides over a hard copy script) ""can you read this to me, please"" (super condescending tone...looking over her glasses, the whole nine) 

PIC: ""sure. This is a script for latanoprost, instructions are 1 drop daily in both eyes.""

Jane: (SLAMS down latanoprost box with her label on it that we've filled) ""Now let's see if you can read what THIS says""

PIC: ""1 drop in right eye daily""

Jane: ""I went to the eye doctor today, and imagine my HORROR (dramatic pause) when he asked me how the drops were doing in BOTH eyes..."" (I'm actually shortening this, because it went on for 3-4 minutes easily) ""sir, you idiots have messed up on SO many prescriptions for me, and this time I want a written apology from corporate. My doctor gave me this copy of the script he faxed you, and clearly as you just confirmed it says both eyes. Are you aware of how much pain I've been in as a result of this!?""

(Meanwhile I'm pulling her up because I know her name and I review verification of the script. Lo and behold it was a phoned in script from Sharon at the eye office 1 gtt od qd)

.....print screen....

I calmly walk over while she's still in the midst of reaming my awesome PIC and of course he's so nice he's just taking it. I hand him the piece of paper and walk away. 

Jane: ""what is THAT!"" Is that a copy of this faxed prescription?! I already brought you a copy"" (mind you it wasn't a copy it was an actual script she brought in)

Pic: ""No, actually it's a copy of the phoned in prescription by your eye doctors office. Do you know Sharon B. who works there?"" 

Jane: ""Yes of course I know Sharon, I saw her there today!""

Pic: ""Well, just so happens that on 9/13 at 11:06 AM, Sharon phoned in this script from Dr. X, and as you can see here, these are not the same instructions, in fact, let me read it for you...1 drop daily into right eye. Would you like a copy of this for your records?""

Sure, easy enough.

I called the patient to sew what was going on since I don't know the situation and inquired about it. 

The patient stated the Dr will only fill scripts for the patient if they were  filled at the adjoining pharmacy or else they'll have to find a new provider. That really rubbed me the wrong way and I felt like I could lodge a complaint to the medical board regarding it. Not sure if it's really my place to do that and if I do do that then I don't want the pt to get kicked off their practice if the Dr finds out.

I asked why the pt couldn't find another provider but they stated they didn't want to go through all the trouble with finding the right Dr for them since it initially took them a bit to find the current Dr. This started kind of recently as well.",39,41,2016-09-17,PHARMA,0.08795555680990219,0.8549773693084717,0.05706702172756195

medicine,My (medical) partner?,"This is a kind of strange question, but I'm curious.  How do all of you refer to the other physicians in your group?  

In my division we have always used the word ""partners"" to refer to the other attendings in the division.  When I first came it felt a little weird, only because we're an academic division, not a private practice, but I've never given it much thought.

However, recently, I was talking to a friend of mine who said that they feel that ""partner"" is now exclusively reserved for LGBTQ significant others and no one uses it in a business context anymore.  They were very surprised to learn that I use it to refer to my divisional partners and felt both that was a little antiquated, and also a little appropriative.  

Ever since, I've felt a little self-conscious about it.  I rotated off service recently and went around explaining to families ""My partner, Dr. X, is taking over for me tomorrow.""  No one seemed to think it was a strange thing to say, but I felt weird.  

So meddit, do you have ""partners,"" too?  If not, what do you use?  I like partner because it frees up ""team member"" to refer to non-physician team members (nurses, genetic counselors, etc.) and ""colleague"" to refer to non-divisional physicians, such as the intensivists, but I don't want to use a word that's confusing to patients.",23,12,2016-09-18,PHARMA,0.0508832186460495,0.9207329154014587,0.02838389202952385
medicine,Antibiotic resistant probiotics? Just a shower thought.,"Howdy! Not a doc, but the other day I had what I'm sure is an exceptionally poor idea. I'd love for you all to tell me why!

So anyways, I was thinking that, with C.diff. being an ever-increasing concern, maybe it would be neat to create RX-only, pan-antibiotic-resistant gut flora/probiotics. Say, perhaps, lactobacillus? It could be administered at the same time as abx, just like the probiotics we give now... except that it wouldn't quickly die in the gut d/t the antibiotics you've got in you. 

I could only think of a couple (likely huge) downsides.  

- If the probiotic used later became involved in some form of infectious process you've screwed yourself terribly. But maybe we could have different strains of the probiotics, resistant to the antibiotics you've chosen and not others. 

- Conferred/transferred resistance (horizontal gene transfer if the Google can be trusted.) I'm not sure which bacterial species exhibit this, but if it's widespread, that'd be unfortunate.

So, thoughts? Feasible in any capacity? Pure idiocy? 

Thanks guys.

medicine,New rural FP inherits a horde of narcotics patients. Looking for ideas to clean up patient panel.,"I'm a new family physician in a rural practice. The group I am with recently lost five physicians, all of which carried heavy loads of chronic pain patients. Now, they are all transferring to me. Initially, I had an unwritten policy that all pain patients capable of travel would be sent to pain management, 45 minutes from here. (Those unable to travel would be placed on contracts). Even with that, the number of pain patients trying to establish care with me was crowding out other health conditions from my schedule. In my first month, I saw over 400 patients in total. 50-60 of those patients were not candidates for travel and had legitimate diagnoses requiring contracts. That ratio has me very, very concerned.

Last week, I added a new policy, notifying in writing all patients seeking to establish with me I am no longer taking new patients on chronic opioids, benzodiazepines, or stimulants. (Still, they make it back to the exam room and try to obtain an exception to the policy). Additionally, I am going back through the first month's contracts to re-evaluate whether the patients can make the journey to pain management. I would like that contract number as close to zero as possible, but this region has an epidemic of degenerative disc diagnoses, a history of doctors who were quite liberal with opiates and benzos, and now, an acute shortage of primary care physicians.

medicine,"What are the five biggest issues or advancements in medicine, over the next 50 years?","Hi everyone! I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, and have been trying to come up with what the biggest advancements coming to health and medicine over the next fifty years. Im curious to hear your thoughts, given different backgrounds and practicing environments may spur different answer.

Personally I would list them as follows (in no particular order).

- Integration of AI in routine portions of consultations to reduce error (INTEGRATION, not replacement)
- Fixing the current research funding system to ensure adequate innovation in areas that can have larger social impact, rather than maximizing profit (e.g. orphan diseases). 
- Improving quality of evidence of health-related information available to public, given shifting medical landscape towards patient autonomy. 
- Technological innovation to increase minimally invasive procedures (with eventual goal of having everything be non-invasive)
- Perfecting genome editing and making it universally accessible.

medicine,Anyone do another residency after practicing?,I am about to start a job as an attending psychiatrist. During residency had recurrent thoughts that I should've pursued internal medicine instead but finished residency. After residency was offered a flexible position in IM. I seriously considered it but my spouse was not really supportive. I have a three year old and am newly pregnant. He bore the brunt of raising our daughter during this residency and is not keen to do that again with two children. I can totally understand this. If I was single I would go for the second residency but it felt too selfish to do it now for the aforementioned reasons and also for financial reasons. I am getting about half of my loans paid for a three-year commitment to my current job and after this both my children will be beyond baby years (no plans to have more than two) and I'm thinking of going back of the second residency at this point if I still have that desire. I have never met anyone personally who has completed two residencies and was wondering if anyone on here has an experience with that?,23,20,2016-09-30,PHARMA,0.04126101732254028,0.9171297550201416,0.0416092574596405
