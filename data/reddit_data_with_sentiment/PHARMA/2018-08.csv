pharmacy,As if we needed another reason to hate PBMs,"Outpatient mental health pharmacist here. Centene Corp runs 45747568 managed medicaid plans across the US. They always require LAIs (but not Haldol dec and Prolixin dec for some reason) to go thru this ""specialty"" mail order pharmacy Acaria Health, which is run by Envolve, which is also under the umbrella of Centene. As you can imagine using a mail order pharmacy for a transient population suffering from severe and persistent is a logistical nightmare. Last week they abruptly began requiring Prolixin and Haldol to go thru Acaria which is throwing mental health clinics for a loop as now these patients show up for their scheduled appointments or walk-in to get their injection and we essentially have to refer them to the ER to get an injection because there it is considered inpatient and they can bill for the LAI. So much for ""keeping people out of the hospital and driving down costs."" Acaria's patient enrollment takes about a week they said and deliveries are inconsistent at best.

This is yet another classic example of PBMs controlling where patients get their meds from even if it is not in the patient's best interest and safety, all in the name of ""cost savings."" In reality they are just being greedy and trying to keep the money for themselves by being the payor, the pharmacy, and in some cases the wholesaler. I imagine the secondary wholesalers I work with feel the squeeze too as they are in competition with the likes of Cardinal, ABC, etc.

Promoting a free market and competition is what drives down healthcare costs. I reject the idea that small businesses, us indie pharmacies, are unable to serve our patients as well big retail chains and deserve to be shut out off the market. Why are brands the only Rxs with real margins that balance out the slim to less than cost margins of most generics? Why do managed medicaid plans start paying 10% more the second the pharmaceutical company increases the price 10% (1/14 Latuda 40mg was $518 for 30 DS and now it $1137). I think these are bipartisan ideas that any politician should/could get behind. Despite these (imo) widely accepted ideas, we are in this dangerous phase of unregulated consolidation of the healthcare market and PBM dominance and politicians have been idle for years allowing for us to reach this current state.

On the upside, there has been a lot of recent press coverage about the dirty PBM tactics (see Columbus Dispatch) and I remain hesitantly optimistic that change is on the way but know full well it will be some time before we see this change. I was impressed with the current lawsuit in California, described in a recent reddit thread, involving the suing of the PBMs and the wholesaler PSAOs. As indies close and big chain pharmacies open at approximately a 4:1 (I think this is probably higher) ratio, one pharmacist is suing the pharmacy board, questioning how a pharmacist is supposed to do what is required by law given the volume burden they carry(http://www.wfmj.com/story/37249955/local-pharmacist-takes-bold-step-against-ohio-board-of-pharmacy). I look forward to more stories like these in the future and hope they spur real change. Please share your stories and insight into PBM change

Again, I remain hesitantly optimistic that change is on the way but just how long will it take and at what/whose expense?

pharmacy,My NAPLEX Experience (the most average of students),"This post ended up being way longer than I intended but if you're like me when I was studying for the NAPLEX, you'll eat this shit up. If anyone has any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them!  

I wanted to make this post for a couple of reasons. Mainly because I must've searched ""NAPLEX"" in the search bar at least a dozen times while I was studying and read every single thread that came up on the subject, but also because I feel like a good chunk of the people that have posted here about the NAPLEX were 4.0 students and scored triple digits without studying for months. So, I figured making a post about my experience being that I ain't super clinically focused would help those in the same boat.

I'd say I'm the average student. I graduated with a 3.1~ while getting mostly Bs and Cs in my classes, took easy as fuck rotations save for 2-3, I would cram for a week or less before a big test and then forget everything...you get the picture. I basically spent all of P3 and P4 year going home right after school and playing WoW until I went to bed. During my easier rotations I'd actually stay up until 3-4 AM playing WoW and going to rotations on 4-5 hours of sleep. Let's just say I'm not the most motivated of people. I still studied enough to pass and never failed any of my classes, but I definitely wasn't the type of person who went crazy over getting amazing grades. If I got a 75 on a DnD (therapeutics) exam, I was pretty pleased. When it came time to study for NAPLEX, I had effectively forgotten almost everything I had learned during school save for the more basic of things.

My studying went as follows: 

I started going through RxPrep after my last rotation toward the end of April and ""studied"" on and off until my exam on July 17th. I had 2.5 months of study time but let's be real, how much did I actually study? Not much, I don't think. During that time my husband visited from out of state for a week for graduation (no studying), I moved across the country to move in with my husband (first time ever cohabitating for me), and I was also working 3-4 (mostly 3) days a week. I pretty much NEVER studied on days I was working because I'd get home around 7 PM and be ready for bed by 10. Who wants to study after working 9 hours and spending 2 hours in traffic? Not me! So I didn't. Studying consisted of reading RxPrep chapters, doing the online quizzes...and that was it. I tried to make study guides by writing everything out but Jesus CHRIST that took forever and it didn't help me remember anything. Overall I went through RxPrep about 3 times - once cover to cover, and twice by skimming and reading only the bolded/underlined material or stuff I was unsure of. I did each quiz about twice and redid all the math and biostats quizzes 2-3 times. I wanted to make sure I had the math perfected to save me time on the exam. I studied ID literally the day before the exam because I fucking HATE ID and I'm never able to retain anything...so I figured I'd just take the loss on those questions. I took the RxPrep 150 question test about a week before my exam and scored 76%, and took the pre-NAPLEX a day or two later and scored 104. Despite going through all the topics in RxPrep a few times each, I still felt like I knew nothing. I'd try and quiz myself at work and try and remember BBWs and side effects of drugs I was pulling and would freak out when I couldn't remember something basic. RxPrep does a good job of making you feel like you don't know anything because of how complex some of the questions are.

The day of my exam came (my birthday, actually!) and I was terrified but calm. I never get anxious before an exam and this was no exception. Honestly...I thought it was fucking easy. I walked out of that exam feeling more confident that I did well than I had for most of my exams during school. The questions were so basic compared to RxPrep I felt ridiculously over prepared for most of the topics. Some things I had no idea about and I just guessed, but the vast majority of the questions I at least had a pretty good idea about what was being asked. Math was simpler than RxPrep and the compounding was actually not bad, but I also went to school in NY and have more of a compounding background than most people. I knew onco and HIV like the back of my hand and I only had 1 HIV question and 2-3 questions on onco supportive care. Fuck me, right? I had questions from what felt like all over the book (even 5-6 page chapters like gout) so I'd advise not to skip anything. I'm a fast test taker and finished the exam in about 2h45min - I skipped my break when it was offered around question 210~ because I just wanted to be done. 

I got my score yesterday (15 days after I took the exam because WA sucks...) and scored 115. Whatever.

tl;dr - 76% on RxPrep 150 question test, 104 on pre-NAPLEX, 115 on NAPLEX after 2.5 months of ""studying."" YOU GOT THIS!",73,71,2018-08-02,PHARMA,0.04173917882144451,0.9095686376094818,0.048692215234041214

pharmacy,Drug interactions between non-rifamycin antibiotics and hormonal contraception: a systematic review.,"A recent systematic review suggests that there is no increased risk of failure of hormonal contraceptives (HC) when co-administered with non-rifamycin antibiotics. I guess I am not that surprised by the results, but still interesting to see a summary of the data on the topic.

Of 7291 original records that were identified, 29 met criteria for inclusion. Also of note is that only 4 of those studies looked at unplanned pregnancy/HC failure as the outcome, the rest of the 29 studies either looked at surrogate measures (e.g. ultrasound for ovarian activity, serum progesterone levels) or pharmacokinetic measures (changes in PK parameters of HC, antibiotic, or both). The quality of included studies was mostly fair-to-poor.

I have a couple concerns about the methods of conducting the systematic review (mainly with having a single author perform study screening and selection) and the low quality of included studies doesn't boost confidence in the results. But having multiple lines of inquiry (pharmacokinetics, surrogate outcomes, objective outcomes) converge on a similar conclusion is encouraging. However, the numerous limitations the authors point out certainly make it hard to generalize these results:

&gt; However, this review is limited by the quality and quantity of published evidence. The observational studies faced
degrees of misclassification bias of antibiotic and HC exposures and pregnancy outcomes (Appendix B). They are
also limited by grouping antibiotics (which may dilute smaller effects), an inability to assess contraceptive adherence, and a lack of adjustment for confounders. Studies that addressed ovulation faced limitations that included small sample sizes and infrequent or poorly timed measurements of progesterone, which may have led to
missed ovulations in some cases (Appendices C-G). Few studies used ultrasound scanning to monitor follicular development and rupture; serum progesterone is itself a surrogate marker for ovulation. Pharmacokinetic studies
had various weaknesses that included not assessing adherence to 1 or both drugs, small sample sizes, use of nonstandardized pharmacokinetic parameters, the use of statistical comparisons that do not take into account therapeutic bioequivalence, a lack of randomization, and a lack of attention to potential confounders (Appendices
C-G). It is also difficult to draw clinical conclusions from pharmacokinetic studies alone because minimum efficacy
thresholds are not established for EE or progestins. Finally, only 1 study examined a non-OC formulation
(CVR [contraceptive vaginal ring]). No data exist on the combination of antibiotics with other nonoral
formulations that include the transdermal patch, injectables, or progestin implants. Studies of OCs included
a range of doses and progestins, but none included the lowest dose pills (ie, containing &lt;30 mg EE or &lt;150 mg levonorgestrel). We did not attempt to normalize findings based on EE or progestin dosing. Therefore, the findings
of this review may not extrapolate to the lowest dose pills that contain 10e25 mg EE or &lt;150 mg levonorgestrel.

What does /r/pharmacy think? Do you normally counsel patients on the risk of contraceptive failure when dispensing antibiotics? Do you recommend alternative/backup methods of contraception? Or did you already drop that counseling point as non-evidence-based? Does this study change your mind?

pharmacy,Suffering from work-related anxiety. Tips anyone?,"I’m in need of tips and ideas badly. Did anyone else experience overwhelming stress and anxiety as a first time soloing pharmacist at CVStress? 

I’ve always been an intern/tech and I was damn good at it. I was always doing everything so my pharmacists didn’t have to lift a finger. 

But now....being the only pharmacist in a pharmacy full of techs who can’t do much.....I am so overwhelmed with all the “attacks” coming at me. Dr calling, patients wanting to chit chat for 30 mins, patients asking where coconut oil is, voicemails, PCQ calls, request calls, re-verification.....9 PM readyfills. AHHHHH!!!! 

Try doing that at 5-7 pm traffic with only 2 techs...*barely new* techs who can’t even pick up phone calls yet. I see now why my pharmacists are always dying for good help and interns. 

My anxiety is triggered the moment I open my eyes in bed and stays steady throughout the day at the pharmacy. Palpitations, tachycardia, etc.

I've spent the last hour and a half looking for an article that I want to share with my family as an older relative is approaching end of life. I read the article a month or two ago, but didn't bookmark it or save it as it wasn't as relevant at the time. After my fruitless search I'm hoping that someone in the crowd will recognize it and point me the right way.

The core of the article is a physician meeting with a patient and the patient's wife. The patient is old and sick. The discussion about care included something along the lines of ""we have an excellent surgeon X who can operate on problem Y, and a great doctor Z who can manage problem W. However, just because we can intervene doesn't mean we have to / should."" They discuss hospice and that it is not the same as giving up--it's actively choosing quality and comfort over unlikely benefit from procedures and hospital care. Family and pt choose hospice in the end. 

Less confident: setting was probably the ED, it might have been a Piece of My Mind from JAMA (but scrolled back through the titles of those through 2014 and didn't find it).

medicine,Most Bizarre Medical School Rituals?,"I was reading in another post about how Dutch medical schools force their students to practice genital and breast exams on each other and it got me thinking about odd medical school rituals.

I know that having male students examine each other's genitals was a very real thing in the past, but was surprised to hear this still occurs today.  

The oddest ritual that I recall was told to me (as a young MS3) by an ancient cardiologist.  To give you context for the time period this story occurs in, this guy was so old that he was a WW2 veteran who had his medical education interrupted by the draft.  

He loved telling stories like any old dude and one day I distinctly remember him telling us on rounds about a bizarre ""blood brothers"" ritual that his medical school class participated in.  They each drew blood from another person and emptied the vials into a communal bowl.  After the bowl was filled with blood from each participant, it was passed from person to person and each had to dip their finger in the admixture and smear it across their face, like ""American Indian warpaint.""  He even told us that at other schools, the ritual involved drinking a sip of the blood from the bowl, although by his time that had fallen out of favor.

I don't remember a lot of the medicine that this cardiologist taught us but that story sticks with me decades later.  I'm curious if anyone else has heard about this practice or any other bizarre medical school rituals?

medicine,"Doctors who have worked in non-US countries but now work in the US, what were your favorite drugs or procedures that were not FDA approved?","I was in Sweden 10 years ago, and my top 3:

1. Corneal cross-linking for keratoconus. Just recently allowed in the US, and 10 years ago I wasn't sure if was really that useful or just pseudoscience, but it has become pretty much standard of care now here.

2. Selective laser trabeculoplasty for glaucoma. Europe has a laser-first, drops-second view on treatment whereas the US is the opposite. The former which might be beneficial considering how many patients are non-compliant with drops, both by not taking them and by missing their eyes when they do try to take them. The US has allowed SLT for a while now but it's still routinely performed only when maximum medical therapy is not effective.

3. Prostaglandin analog + beta blocker combo drop for glaucoma. PGAs are first-line, BBs are second-line; how can we not have a #1+#2 drop when we have #2+#3 and #3+#4 drops? Although there are a few compounding pharmacies that can do this, I don't think they can compete on price with two generic drops, and if/when a PGA+BB combo drop does come out, it's still going to be more expensive for years.",179,208,2018-08-10,PHARMA,0.06308873742818832,0.9089796543121338,0.027931615710258484

pharmacy,A Minor Irritation,"Maybe I'm missing something and shouldn't react this way, but I get mildly annoyed every time I ask a patient, ""Do you have any questions?"" and the response is, ""I'm a registered nurse.""

Oh, okay, cool. Good for you. That must mean that you know everything about medication ever. Maybe nurses aren't allowed to have questions due to their *entirely comprehensive* pharmacology education. I dunno. Maybe I should start going to the doctor and replying, ""I'm a pharmacy student,"" to them whenever they ask me if I have questions about a medical condition. Like sure, I probably have some idea about what's going on due to also being a health professional, but I'm also okay with recognizing that my formal training doesn't focus entirely on diagnostics and physiology. I think it's cool if our shared medical experience comes up in conversation to let the provider know that we can discuss things at a higher level, but I don't know that I should use my career choice as an answer. 

Currently, I just answer, ""no,"" or ask a question when asked. 

It's such a small thing, and really it doesn't impact my life. I just found myself annoyed today and wanted to share.

I wanted some feedback to what we all see this subreddit as. I personally have seen this community as a means for people who are entry or experience levels to converse about what is going on in our industry. With that in mind, I personally dont appreciate the spam of biotech PR news/spam.

For example, currently the leading post is about Merck's oncology drug approval. Thats great, but personally, unless it is a HUGE breakthrough drug (as opposed a new synergy indication) I would prefer to see this on random PR newswire or LinkedIn. Based off the OPs posting history and comments it definitely smells botish. None the less, there are upvotes. If thats why you guys like to see on this subreddit, I'll continue to scroll past it.

medicine,"With all the recent loan talk, I just wanted to highlight the Primary Care Loan which helped me pay off 240k in 2.5 yrs after residency","For those of you going to medical schools in the US that graduate a high percentage of primary care doctors, there may be a special loan program available from the government, called the Primary Care Loan. The loan has a lot of perks that helped me pay off 240k in 2 1/2 yrs after residency.  

If your school is on the list, the loan is available to you.
https://ersrs.hrsa.gov/ReportServer/Pages/ReportViewer.aspx?/HGDW_Reports/EHB_BHPR_LOAN_PROG/PCL_Loan_Program_List&amp;rs:Format=HTML4.0

Perks: 

1) No interest in medical school and residency.

2) No payments required in medical school and residency. If you do pay, it goes towards principal as there is no interest until after residency.

3) Simple interest compounded annually after residency.

4) No location requirement. You can practice anywhere as long as it is primary care.

Caveats:

1) Yearly certifications that you are in primary care.

2) No take backsies. Once you sign, if you specialize, there is a high interest penalty for specializing. 

3) No perks of government loans like forebearance (although you probably won't need it with no payment requirements in residency). No refinancing with a private Pender (although private lenders probably can't beat simple interest, annually).

4) If you decide on primary care later on in med school, they won't pay for interest in your previous years before you decided. 


With this loan, I was able to pay off my 240k loan by doing the following:

1) Saved all the money I would have paid in residency in an index fund during a bull market.

2) After residency, dumped that money (after taxes) into the loan (80k).

3) Signed up for a job that had a bonus for primary care doctors (80k).

4) Paid half my monthly paycheck to loans.


With all this news about free tuition, I wanted to highlight a way that  might be available to more people. With this loan it is very possible to live comfortably in residency and after and still pay off your loans quickly. Don't let loan burden be the determining factor if this loan is available to you.",26,109,2018-08-22,PHARMA,0.0373014435172081,0.9278836250305176,0.03481492027640343

The largest [non-profit hospital](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2017/03/06/ascension-s-tersigni-others-cited-in-wsj-study-on.html) and [for-profit hospital](https://aflcio.org/paywatch/HCA) both have Ed.Ds at the top, both with massive compensation packages. I had to Google Ed.D and almost all of the links were regarding hospital administration. With physician compensation *per hour worked* likely at its shittiest in history, burnout at all time highs, 7.5 minute patient appointments (McDonald's has a similar system for burger flippers), it seems like you folks are getting totally screwed, at least if this sub is accurate in its depiction of medicine.

​

Medical professionals don't need more resilience. If I had to put up with this much shit, I'd go nuts. Maybe I'm missing something?

&amp;#x200B;

Update:

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to thank you folks for doing what you do, especially under the the current environment. A physician that spent too much time on me, has terrible patient review for idiotic reasons, and tells me at least one attorney joke per visit, completely changed my life years ago. He sure as hell didn't need someone telling him how to do his job. I would be devastated if he burned out. I definitely didn't want this post to in any way deter someone from medicine as a career. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think non-medical professionals, including myself, have any business dictating the way you practice medicine. I'd be happy to share some insights from my evil litigator perspective about how you might fight back, none of which involve litigation if anyone is interested. I definitely think there's hope if there's collective will to do something about it.

medicine,A randomized controlled trial of a workplace wellness intervention showed no 'significant causal effects of treatment' on multiple health-related and cost-effectiveness outcomes,"PDF Link: http://www.nber.org/papers/w24229.pdf

An article from the National Bureau of Economic Research performed a randomized controlled trial of a 'comprehensive workplace wellness program', with the authors stating that they did 'not find significant causal effects of treatment on total medical expenditures, health behaviors, employee productivity, or self-reported health status in the first year'. The abstract (where I'm getting these quotes from) is on page 2.

This article is the first randomized controlled trial on this subject, according to [this source](https://www.bps.org.uk/news-and-policy/first-randomised-controlled-trial-employee-%E2%80%9Cwellness-programme%E2%80%9D-suggests-they-are). I figured this would be interesting to the people of meddit, not just because of the relevance to psychology, but also because medical schools and hospitals routinely employ 'resilience' and 'wellness workshops' in their programs.

medicine,"Today, I finally felt like I did some good for the first time.","Hi! I am currently a PGY1 in OBGYN. Excuse this post, but I feel like I need to share this quick story and brag on myself just a little bit. Long story short, I’ve been liking residency so far and I’m certain I went into the right field. However since starting, I’ve always felt like I was just “fitting in.” I was able to take care of floor patients, write orders, give prescriptions, deliver babies, and even be primary on c-sections. I know that I was able to help patients, but it almost felt routine.

Today though, I was in our eval (kind of like a women’s ED). As the intern, I was the first to see everyone and come up with a plan before going over it with my upper levels. A woman came in with mild cramping at 30 WGA. She had good baby movement, no vaginal bleeding, no loss of fluid. I thought it was a routine maternal discomfort complaint but as soon as I saw her strip, I knew something was up. She had been on the monitor for a few minutes, but I think I saw some prolonged decels and mild, short interval contractions. I told my chief, but we weren’t sure as we didn’t have a good baseline yet. He just told me to keep an eye on it.

So anyways I kept routinely triaging folks. 15 minutes later, she started gushing blood and felt severe abdominal pain. She had abrupted and had a stat C. This was the first time I had seen an abruption.  It’s true what they say: you’ll never forget the presentation once you see an abruption. Luckily she did ok but the chief and attending told me that normally, they’d wait a few minutes to see a “maternal discomfort” patient as they generally aren’t as severe as laboring or bleeding patients. However since I noticed the decels and the contractions, we were able to atleast make the OR aware of a possible stat. It was a great compliment to hear the chief and attending say “good job, you helped save her and her baby.”

pharmacy,Opioid argument with Physician left me fuming (Long),"Hey guys, I really need help with this one. Scenario happened yesterday and I can’t tell you how pissed off I was/still am. Even one of my techs took notice and asked if I needed to take a minute, which I did, and I almost never do. Anyway here’s the scenario, would appreciate any feedback/support/advice. 


Had an Rx come in for Percocet 5/325 #5. Filled it. On verification it said patient had an opioid allergy with no details of the reaction. Fine, it’s probably nothing, just the usually nausea/vomiting, but if it is something better be safe than sorry, so I put it a mandatory forced counsel at the register to confirm what kind of allergy to opioids the patient has, so we can’t sell the script until a pharmacist speaks to her. 

She comes in we talk, turns out it’s legit. She has an allergy to codeine, and states that her throat starts to swell up and it gets hard for her to breath. Now this is a true allergy. I explain to the patient the risk of cross sensitivity (which is probable given they’re both phenanthrenes, albeit from natural and semi synthetic classes, the risk is definitely still there), we have a legitimately good discussion and she states that she definitely doesn’t want to take it if there’s even a small risk of that happening again, that she’s not really in that much pain and she’s only here because the doctor told her she should get it because she needs to have something.  She states she’s going to call her doctor and discuss alternatives or what to do. 


Few minutes later I get an escript for hydrocodone Apap 5/325 #5. Oh great here we go again. Same predicament. I figure maybe the doctor just needs a little help, so I again alert the patient and tell her I’ll  call the office to make a recommendation. Figured it’d be an easy conversation, this is what me and the patient talked about, she seems really worried about the cross sensitivity of the allergy, and she states she’s not in a lot of pain. How about tramadol? Oh boy was I wrong. 


This physician got on the phone with an immediate attitude problem. Starts immediately attacking me for lying to his patient. Tells me there’s absolutely no cross sensitivity between those drugs whatsoever. That if I had a doctorate I should start putting it to use because medicine can’t be practiced following only a book word for word, there’s a lot of gray,  That he’s been doing this for 20 years and that I’m lying to his patient. Just give the patient the medication, there’s no problem with it. How he doesn’t understand who I am to question him.  This guy, everything he said, pissed me the fuck off. He made it clear from the get go that he had no interest in hearing what I had to say, and the only reason he picked up the phone was to force me to fill and sell the script to his patient while being an asshole about it. 

I tried explaining to him that there most definitely is a risk, and I’m not going to lie to the patient and say there isn’t one just because he has a knowledge gap and that the patient has a right to be informed. I also told him his behavior and condescending attitude is highly unprofessional and that he needs to work on his inter professional skills. 

Then he starts going off on some tangent about how medicine in the real world is different from the books you read. If a patient has an allergy to Amoxicillin you can still give them Augmentin and they’ll be fine. This is where I drew the line. Just the absurdity of that statement alone made me realize this guy is a terrible doctor.  I told him that is simply not true and that if he does this he really needs to rethink how he practices medicine. As someone who is allergic to amoxicillin, I would immediately ask for another doctor if my current one tried to prescribe Augmentin. (Sidebar: maybe there is some case where this would be necessary, but honestly you’d have to legitimately have no better option)

Now I can put up with a lot, especially if it means swallowing my pride some, so that my patient walks away happy and confident on their path to better health, but after that comment about Augmentin it became abundantly clear that this conversation was going nowhere and that he had no interest aside from trying to force my hand. So I said to him: 

“Sir, here’s the thing. I spoke to the patient, I explained to her the concerns about the medication. I called you to see how we could work together to come up with a more appropriate therapy for her, but all I’ve come away with from this conversation is that you have very little knowledge of allergies, very little interest in providing good therapy for your patients, and even less respect for other medical practitioners. As such I will not be filling this prescription for the patient as I do not believe it’s safe for her to receive it and because I have serious doubts about the knowledge of the practitioner who wrote it. I’ll be sure to let the patient know that the reason she can’t get her medication is due to your unwillingness to communicate and take the issue seriously.” 


He kept trying to speak over me towards the end and ask for the pharmacy manager, and my supervisor. I’m the pharmacy manager. I told him I hope he decides to research the issue and reflect on his prescribing practices before he writes his next script and hung up. 


I really don’t know what I’m asking for from you guys. Support I guess? Did I miss anything here? Did I do something wrong. I guess I’m still just really mad about how condescending this guy was. I’ve dealt with bad doctors before, but this guy was just on another level entirely.

I’ve noticed a recurring theme of veterans being anywhere from annoyed to frustrated to outright angry that their PCP is graduating/moving away (sometimes insisting on blaming the VA/funding/the government). In a lot of ways I get this; we deal with a lot of sensitive topics and psychosocial barriers, plus telling a life story in a “new PCP” appointment repetitively has to be annoying. 

Our attendings don’t often see the resident patients face-to-face beyond the first half of our intern year unless there’s something strange or serious, which means most patients don’t know their more consistent supervising attending, and the resident role as gatekeeper to VA services (and thus the face of the VA) I’m sure both contribute.
