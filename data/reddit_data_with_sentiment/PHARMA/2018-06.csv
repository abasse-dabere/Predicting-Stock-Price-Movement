pharmacy,"Pharmacy Friends... Worried about pay cuts, store closings, getting laid off, hours being cut and degradation of profession? Well keep worrying as long as we have PBM owned pharmacies...","Example: Imagine a pt with PBSBearmark insurance comes to kroger to fill his/her lisinopril. Kroger is not preferred pharmacy so PBSCaremark will charge a patient copay of 1.80 and PBSBearmark will pay kroger 0 dollars. Now the same patient will get a letter in 48 hours saying if the go to their preferred pharmacy PBS, the copay will be 0 dollars. All the people in world think o look healthcare cost went down... nothing wrong in this business practice.

Until you realize yes that patient copay was 0 dollars at PBS pharmacy but plan (PBSBearmark) paid PBS the preferred pharmacy 10 dollars.

Pharmacies like kroger, rite aid, independents are losing patients and money left and right because of PBM owned pharmacies and mailorders.

Thus, hour cuts, store closing and basic shitshow for the profession.

NOW AGAIN mind you its all done in the name of saving health care cost.... BULLSHIT!!!! They reimburse their preferred pharmacy shit ton of money... they spend billions of dollars lobbying to run their shit show... Yes from the outside looking in... patient saved few bucks on copay but overall HEALTHCARE COST goes up and profession loses big time


Other few examples from some of my friends from the independent scene that they have shared with me...
Bumana Insurance: Copay At Mom&amp;Pop Pharmacy $15 for 90 days Copay at Tallmart pharmacy $2.50 for 90 days

PBSBearmark Insurance: Copay for generic steroid cream at neighborhood pharmacy $135... same medication copay at PBS pharmacy $25

Dricare (da gum govt) Insurance: Copay at Joe pharmacy $37 for 30 day supply same medication copay at Represscripts mail away $37 for 90 day supply 

I can go on and on and on...

Well at least when you get a phone call from your non-pbm owned pharmacy DM about hours cut, pay cut or job cut atleast you will know its noting personal they are losing patients and $$$ left and right.

Well if you get a call from pbm owned pharmacy DM about paycut and hours cut well dont be alarmed they had to pay shit ton of money lobbying to rig the game so now your ass is gonna check 500 scripts with 15 hrs of tech help :)

medicine,Proposed PA Law Would Require ALL Physicians to Complete 2 Hours of Lyme Disease CME,"http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2017&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=2301&amp;pn=3448

So I came across this, didn't see anything in the news. This bill would require all Physicians, Physician Assistants, and Nurse Practitioners in Pennsylvania to complete 2 hours of Lyme disease training for their CME requirements. It does not add to the total number of hours of CME to be completed. It seemed like a weird CME requirement for all specialties as a non-medical person.

The bill says some stuff and does some stuff that makes me question what's really going on here: 
 
&gt; 4)  Approximately 10% to 40% of Lyme disease patients may go on to suffer from a complex, chronic disease which is much more difficult to treat.

Is this true? I cannot find any evidence to back this up. That doesn't sound right to me. I only get linked to sites that are ""chronic lyme"" advocacy groups when I search some combination of that.

&gt;  To ensure quality and balanced medical education, the licensing board shall take into consideration the philosophies of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health, **International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society** and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, as well as the latest scientific evidence and research.

From what I can tell the ""International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society"" is basically ACAM only it exists to low-key peddle Chronic Lyme and ""treatments"" for it to the public at large. They seem pretty shady to me. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4489928/

It seems to me like this is really a push to legally enshrine ILADS as a credible source of information on Lyme Disease.

pharmacy,I want to take a moment to clarify the 80-125% rule for bioequivalence.,"This post was inspired by a comment chain in a post that has since been deleted.  It has become apparent to me that relatively few people understand how the FDA determines bioequivalence and what this means for the interchangeability of generic drug products.  I feel that this is critically important information for all pharmacists.

In basic terms, the FDA considers a generic product to be bioequivalent to the brand product if the 90% confidence intervals of the AUC and Cmax fall within 80 to 125% of the reference product. There are two common mistakes that people tend to make when interpreting this definition.

The first mistake I usually hear from patients rather than other pharmacists. Let's use phenytoin as an example. They hear ""80-125%"" and immediately assume that it means that generic phenytoin 100 mg capsules may only contain 80 mg of phenytoin (i.e. 80%) and could therefore be less effective. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the FDA's definition of bioequivalence; the 80-125% refers to various measures of serum concentration, not to the amount of medication present in the dosage form, which must be essentially identical (allowing for reasonable deviations due to the infeasibility of ever being able to measure things with literal 100% accuracy).

The second mistake is a bit more nuanced, and unfortunately I often hear it from other pharmacists. In essence, people tend to believe that because the 90% confidence intervals of the AUC and Cmax for the generic product must fall within 80-125% of the brand product, that serum concentrations can differ by 20-25%. In other words, let's say the Cmax of a dose of brand Dilantin 100 mg is 20 mg/L (just making up numbers here). People will say, ""That means that generic phenytoin 100 mg may only produce a Cmax of 16 mg/L."" That is absolutely not the case, and the key is to remember the importance of the phrase ""90% confidence interval."" Most of us on this forum are either pharmacists or pharmacy students, so I'll assume that we've all had biostatistics and understand what a confidence interval is. So let's say that the assertion I just mentioned is true and that generic phenytoin 100 mg produces a Cmax of 16 mg/L. The 90% confidence interval in that case might be 14.8-16.9 mg/L (the point is that the lower end would be less than 16). So this would not meet the definition of bioequivalence because even though the measured point value falls within 80-125% of the reference product, the 90% confidence interval does not, and that's what the FDA is concerned about. In order for the 90% confidence interval to fall in that range, the actual point value must be extremely close to the reference product (generally no more than 5% but often much closer than that). For example, we might see generic phenytoin 100 mg yield a Cmax of 19.7 mg/L with a 90% confidence interval of 18.4-20.5 mg/L. In this case, since the entire confidence interval falls within the 80-125% range (i.e. 16-25 mg/L), the FDA would deem the products to be bioequivalent. But the key is that in order for the entire confidence interval to fall within the range, the actual point values must be extremely close, well within the range that would make no clinical difference for any medication (especially once you factor in the multiple AUC measurements). So many people overlook the fact that the definition is specifically referring to confidence intervals, but it's so incredibly important.

I'm very passionate about this topic because there is so much misinformation being propagated about generics only being as good as brands ""most of the time"" (looking at you, levothyroxine*), when the reality is that they're always as good, and any pharmacist who suggests otherwise is providing suboptimal care for their patients and driving up healthcare costs for no reason. In the very rare instances when new data shows otherwise (e.g. certain manufacturers of bupropion XL and methylphenidate ER), the FDA does its job appropriately and deems the products to no longer be interchangeable.

*There are a couple of fantastic articles on PubMed that discuss levothyroxine specifically and are worth reading if anyone has further interest in the subject.",56,397,2018-06-03,PHARMA,0.056176191195845604,0.9121424853801727,0.03168131783604622

medicine,“Clinical documentation integrity specialists” and being a resident,"CDI specialists are basically nurses hired to review our charts and “suggest” to us what to add in our documentation to bill more. 

In theory, I get it. The hospital loses money because residents have 0 billing education and this is an imperfect system.

But in practice this is very frustrating to me. We’re told that we need to respond to these documentation “queries” within 48 hrs. If we don’t, or if we are seen as obstructing this process by declining to follow their “suggestions” we can be reprimanded on professionalism by GME.

My issue is that it feels like I take on all the risk here. I’m documenting notes and billing for things that are “suggested” to me by someone who’s job depends on their effectiveness at increasing returns on billing. Meanwhile they are not being held liable because these are just “suggestions” or “queries” and the buck ultimately stops with me, the MD who has 0 education in billing and will be reprimanded if i don’t follow their suggestions. 

I’m sure the actual rate of fraud is low, but I still really don’t like this set up. Learning how to bill is a valuable thing for me and my future practice and it would be nice if we somehow got some “basics of billing” course as an intro in orientation or something.

medicine,"As an OR Nurse, I'm Needing feedback on appropriateness of a gift for graduating surgical fellow / new attending / good friend","Hello all,

I'm an OR nurse in a large east coast hospital and I'm needing some feedback on the appropriateness of a gift for one of our surgical fellows that is finishing soon and will be starting as an attending at another location.

--------------------------------------------------------

For a variety of reasons, this surgical fellow and I hit it off as friends as soon as he arrived. We have fairly matching personalities that are very relaxed, don't take things too seriously and inject a good amount of humor into the majority of our conversations. Beyond work, we've gone out several times for beers and food to just talk and blow off steam. During the duration of their fellowship, this fellow has called me several times to reflect on unexpected situations and receive my $0.02 per se. I say that last sentence as a reenforcement of our relationship/friendship, not as a place to brag.

--------------------------------------------------------

Anyways, long story short, I respect this person very much and have enjoyed our time together immensely. I wanted to get this person a gift that would not only be enjoyable but also helpful for their future journey as an attending surgeon. 

--------------------------------------------------------

For me personally, I have a bit of a hobby reading about personal finance, investing, planning, frugality, watching Dave Ramsey, ect. Throughout my time working in a surgical department, I've been amazed at how many people I work with across the spectrum (techs, nurses, docs, ect.) have no idea about personal finance topics such as retirement options (IRA's, 403(b), 401k's, ect.), paying off debts, tax brackets, ect. I've been approached by several coworkers on asking basic questions, wherein I usually give them a variety of resources to teach themselves and keep a metaphorical open door to come back for more information. Again, I'm putting this information out there as a foundation before getting into the main meat of my question....

--------------------------------------------------------

I would like to give this new attending the book ""The White Coat Investor"" - a short and simple book covering a wide variety of financial topics for high income earning careers, mainly focused at doctors. I have never talked to this new attending about their personal finances except for them mentioning that they've maxed out all of their credit cards throughout their fellowship. My aim in giving this book to them is to provide a resource to help them make educated financial decisions as a new attending. 

--------------------------------------------------------

I understand that personal finance and money in general can be a tricky subject from person to person. For those of you out there listening, is this gift appropriate or should I hold back and find a nice bottle of four roses whiskey? (sarcasm intended)


Thanks in advance for your time, consideration and thoughts on this topic. Be nice to your OR nurses and staff",10,36,2018-06-05,PHARMA,0.04036282002925873,0.9290943741798401,0.030542854219675064

Patient had been receiving Topamax since being diagnosed at 18. Her insurance, MassHealth, required a PA for the medication once she turned 19. When the patient, now 19 years old, received a Topamax script from her doctor, she took it to Walgreens. The pharmacist told her it would need a PA and that the out of pocket cost would be $400, which the patient could not afford. The patient's family then called the doctor's office several times thinking that the doctor was just waiting on the pharmacy to send the PA form. Patient's family had also called Walgreens a couple times, to which an employee responded that a call would be made to the doctor on their behalf about the PA. Patient ended up running out of her medication and experienced a couple of seizures. She had even been discharged by a hospital after a seizure with Topamax, which of course, was not filled due to needing PA. She tried to fill her script 4 more times, being denied for PA each time. Her third seizure resulted in her death in 2009.

Walgreens denied that the employee offered to call the doctor. It also has no records of ever contacting the doctor. Doctor denied ever knowing about the PA or having been notified by the pharmacy or the patient's family about the PA requirement. The superior court ruled in favor of Walgreens, stating that Walgreens has no legal duty to inform the doctor of the PA requirement. SJC then overruled it, determining that actually, there was a legal duty to inform the doctor.

What are your thoughts on this? There were many ways this death could have been prevented, but I find it hard to agree that Walgreens should be at fault front and center. Did the patient's family really call the doctor's office? Why didn't the patient ask for a different medication that might be covered? Could the pharmacist have offered to call for a different medication to be considered? Did the doctor really not receive any of the PA alerts from Walgreens or patient's family? Those are some of the questions that pop in to my head and I'm sure there will be more.",92,88,2018-06-07,PHARMA,0.09500449150800705,0.881726086139679,0.02326938882470131
pharmacy,I don't want to be a mid-level provider,"I'm a current pharmacy student, about to start my P3 year, just freshly finishing my institutional IPPE (finished my community IPPE last year) and currently work at a retail chain. All throughout my time in pharmacy school many of my law and policy professors always talk about provider status, prescribing powers, and etc. I think all these are fine, but the one thing that I really hate is that they always say, ""functioning as mid\-level providers"".

I don't know about you all, but I really don't want to be a ""mid\-level provider"". If I wanted to be a mid\-level I would've gone to PA, optometry, or NP school. Maybe i'm just naive, but in my experience right now with rotations and working I truly think pharmacists are way more than that. I like it when physicians consult us with complex patients and don't know what to do, I like it when nurses call us asking what we think are dumb medication related questions but they truly don't know, I like compounding (even if techs do this most of the time), I like assessing orders, I like kinetically dosing medications, and I like talking to patients regarding their medications. Hell, just during my last rotation, a patient was refusing to take Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis because he was already on Plavix and ASA thinking his blood ""will get too thin"". The physician and nurses didn't know how to handle the patient and requested pharmacy to speak with the him. After about a 10 minute conversation, the patient was okay with taking the drugs because he now knew what the drugs were actually used for and what they were doing. This is just the most recent example too. Stuff like this tells me that pharmacists have a role in healthcare that only we can fill. Plus, I feel the newer generation of physicians really appreciate the expertise we bring and compliments well with what they know.

I don't think having provider status is a bad thing. I like the idea of not only saving my employer money but also the ability to bring money in. However, if that means we become midlevels I don't want it. I don't want to be a physician\-lyte (I  would've gone to medical school if I wanted to be a physician) and see people with runny noses and UTI's. I want to be a f\*cking pharmacist and be the medication expert.

medicine,Surprisingly beautiful moment today...would love to hear about the times your patients have made you choke up for good reasons,"Just finished a 24 hour call on the labor and delivery floor as an anesthesia resident, and one patient encountered has really stuck with me.

I was called to do a C-section for a 16 year old, father of baby also 16. She asked if both her boyfriend and her mother could be in the OR with us and I of course said yes. I met her and she seemed spunky, fun, sassy, but in pain due to her preeclampsia. Her boyfriend was....wide eyed and extremely quiet. In my experience these young fathers-to-be are often silent and anxious and very prone to freaking out, obviously not ready for the challenges ahead and kind of wrapped up in their own meltdown, often to the point where they can't really engage fully in what's going on. That's the initial impression I got.

We go to the OR, I place the spinal, and now she's feeling good, very happy and her full, delightful personality comes out. Her mom and boyfriend join us. I notice her mother is excited and very supportive, and I notice she is also paying extra special attention to calming down her daughter's boyfriend and reassuring him, which I thought was very sweet and a sign that good support systems would hopefully be in place for this young couple. That said, he was still quiet and like a deer in headlights. I assumed he'd be like other teen dads I'd met, who were kind of detached and obviously freaking out about what's going on. He stayed quiet as the procedure got under way.

To my surprise, baby is about to be delivered, and he's gripping mom's hand so tight...When we hear the baby cry, I'm focused on plugging in oxytocin etc. when I hear a sound next to me...I look over and see that he is smiling and sobbing, tears of joy streaming down his face.

He was invited over to the warmer while NICU evaluated the baby (premature but doing very well), and he holds out a finger, which the baby grabs, and he just keeps sobbing and sobbing and smiling, unable to control this rush of emotions as he meets his child for the first time, while still honestly being a child himself.

This doesn't happen to me often. Most of my patients are asleep, most are getting something routine and/or unpleasant done in the OR. I love OB and spend a lot of time on L&amp;D, and I love the reactions of the new dads. But even so....this young man was so overcome by his emotions he couldn't hold them in. It touched me in a way I don't often experience in medicine, and I nearly cried myself. 

These two new parents have a lot of struggles and challenges ahead, but the patient smiled and told me, ""I wasn't expecting that of him."" Combined with how loving and supporting her mother was of the two of them, it gave me hope, and it was such a genuine, emotional, happy moment, I don't think I'll ever forget it.

It's nice to get a reminder sometimes that people can surprise you, and that life can really, sometimes, be truly joyful, even if only for a short time before the drudgery of day-to-day comes back to hit us over the head. I would love to hear all of your memorable experiences where a patient brought you to tears for the good reasons :)",67,817,2018-06-10,PHARMA,0.07892203330993652,0.8881422281265259,0.032935790717601776

What is it about morphine that makes it a good first-line choice for surgery? Especially cardio patients?

Is it because morphine is the least potent out of all the opioids? So start patients with something lower first?

**My thoughts**

So for many that work in Peds EM, peds, EM, or peds CC the greatest fear we have when resuscitating little kiddos with DKA is that we are going to cause cerebral edema. For years those of us working down in the ER have been yelled at by pediatricians and peds intesivists for giving 20mL/kg boluses for children in DKA we believed required significant fluid resuscitation because they believed we were increasing the likelihood of cerebral edema by rapidly infusing large amounts of fluid. They preferred that we give an initial small bolus, with gentle resuscitation over the next several hours to days. This fear was based on very poor quality observational/heavily biased data that has only up until recently been called into question. The EM folk for decades have been pouring large amounts of fluid into adult DKA patients with no signal of harm, so this fear never really passed the smell test for us because as most of us know children really are, for the most part, just little adults (with some established differences in anatomy and physiology). Nevertheless, it was not until yesterday that we finally had an RCT to back our practice. 

This RCT is a 2x2 factorial design (.9% vs .45% NS and rapid vs slow fluid administration) performed in 13 separate EDs. 

*Inclusion Criteria*: Age 0-18 with diagnosis of DKA

*Exclusion Criteria*: Concurrent disorders affecting neurocognition (alcohol/drug abuse, head trauma, known neurological diseases), substantial resuscitation prior to randomization, specific fluid or electrolyte therapy required (ugh!), and after year 2 they just decided that anyone with a GCS &lt; 12 should be excluded because their belief was that these patient's fluid regimen should not be determined by randomization (UGGHH!! I'll touch on this later). 

*Therapy*: Children were assigned to 1 of 4 therapeutic options. Slow infusion of 0.45% NS, slow infusion of 0.9% NS, fast infusion of 0.45% NS, fast infusion of 0.9% NS. Treatment was otherwise identical. Everyone received an initial 10mL/kg bolus of IVF. Those assigned to slow infusion therapy were then started on maintenance + deficit IVF administration over the next 48 hours (presumed fluid deficit of 10% of body weight). Those assigned to fast infusion received an additional 10mL/kg bolus (total of 20mL/kg upfront) then started on maintenance + deficit IVF administration over next 24 hours. 

*Primary Outcome*: Neurologic deterioration defined by two consecutive scores of GCS &lt; 14 any hour over first 24 hours (ugh! again, will discuss this later)

*Secondary Outcome*: Short term memory, clinically apparent brain injury defined by neurological deterioration leading to hyperosmolar therapy, intubation, or death (the results I care the most about)

*Results*: I'll keep it brief, y'all can read the table included in the trial linked, but there were no statistically significant differences in any of the groups for any outcome. There were some differences in subgroup analysis in clinically insignificant outcomes favoring fast infusion groups; however, probably not worth covering.

*Limitations (my beefs with the paper)*: 

1. Individuals with significant electrolyte issues are more likely to have severe DKA, so I would have preferred they not exclude these patients.

2. My biggest beef was that the study 2 years into it excluded the exact patient population most likely to develop cerebral edema (those with a GCS &lt; 12). They ended up excluding 67 of these patients total. It just does not make sense to me that the patients we care most about are the ones that were excluded. 

3. The primary outcome as was defined did not measure what it was purporting to measure, as individuals who started off with lower GCS would have been lumped into having a result of ""neurological deterioration"" which makes absolutely no sense. I would have preferred they power their study to appropriately evaluate differences in clinically apparent brain injury defined by intubation, hyperosmolar therapy, and death which is the most patient centered outcome of this trial (and essentially the only patient centered outcome).

4. These were all very well appearing DKA patients for the most part (which is consistent with what we see), only about 2% of the study population had a GCS &lt; 14. These patients were very unlikely to develop significant neurological deterioration, so additional studies might be necessary to determine if fluid infusion rates make a difference in those most likely to deteriorate (low GCS, significant electrolyte abnormalities, very low pH, etc.) 

**My Takeaway**

This is nothing earth shattering. This study might lead to decreased hospital length of stays in peds patients, but that outcome isn't as important to me in the ER. This will not change my practice. I will still give as much fluid resuscitation as I believe necessary in children with DKA. Some might require &lt;20mL/kg, some might require more. The biggest thing about this paper for me is that I will finally have something outside of observational data to point to when the peds intensivist berates me over the phone for giving a DKA patient what I believe to be an appropriate amount of fluid resuscitation.

medicine,Appeasing patients with inappropriate medicine? Inspired by video of suspended ER doctor.,"Like others, I could relate to the ER doc that was suspended after being filmed losing her temper with a patient (link to post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/8rfumn/er\_doctor\_suspended\_after\_caught\_on\_video/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/8rfumn/er_doctor_suspended_after_caught_on_video/)). Many comments suggested prescribing something benign to the patient (NSAIDs, fluids, etc.), despite these treatments presumably not being indicated, to appease the patient and his father and facilitate the discharge.

I'm finishing up internal medicine residency and I use the appeasement strategy around-the-clock. I appease patients in clinic with chronic pain, fibromyalgia, IBS, etc. by adding any one of a long list of drugs I essentially see as placebo to get them out of the office without complaining that I'm not doing anything for them. Same thing in the hospital. Another twist is to appease with useless diagnostic testing or by delaying discharge without any change in plan or actual need of hospitalization. All to sneakily satisfy the patient's request that something be done or give the impression that their complaint being taken more seriously, without actually doing anything.

If I try to do what I genuinely think is right, patients or families often get upset and even if I take a long time to explain my rationale they are rarely persuaded, e.g. ""So you're not going to do anything?"" or ""OK, I want to talk to your attending."" (which, by the way, ends with the attending appeasing the patient with something inappropriate and, once we're out of the room, telling me they agreed with my original plan.)

This is a part of medicine that I was never trained to deal with or warned about, and it is something that I deal with every single day.

This problem is so frustrating to me that it is shaping my career decisions more so than money, hours, or any of the usual things. I want to minizime my clinical time and devote myself to research which, despite having its own problems, seems like an environment where rational thought and intellectual rigor are valued. And if that fails, then it's time for cranking out RVUs and retiring early.

It is shocking how little weight a doctor's thoughts are given. In the case of the ER doc video, she is an expert that made a diagnosis and treatment plan. Because two non-experts (patient and father) did not like the expert opinion, then the expert is supposed to change it? That is crazy. Yet, it happens all the time.

medicine,Fever with bacteriuria and no other symptoms,"I imagine this is a very common scenario

A patient spiked fever with no obvious localising source

A full septic workup is done, including screening the urine

Urine is found to be pyuric, but clinically the patient has no symptoms aside from the fever. No chills, rigors, flank pain, nausea or even cystitis symptoms. This is in a patient who can communicate and give a clear history, convincing examination.

A urine culture is taken and the patient is treated empirically for UTI.

An ID physician once told me - UTI as a cause of fever with no localising symptoms is a diagnosis of exclusion - this includes considering non-infective causes especially DVT, central fevers and malignant fevers (some of which are themselves diagnoses of exclusion, but if he can keep them inpatient and monitor he will not treat for UTI unless the patient turns unwell or symptomatic.) Basically for him the indication to treat in such a scenario was only if the patient had become clinically unstable and the risk of deterioration without treatment was high.

In my experience most other physicians are quick to treat for UTI anyway, and I can still stomach that.

However, classical teaching is that any UTI with fever should be treated as for pyelonephritis.

Yet in such patients with do not even have lower tract symptoms, most people end up treating the fever as for cystitis. This seems like a rather half-hearted effort to me - like we don’t even believe in the diagnosis and are just throwing antibiotics at it.

medicine,Would it be appropriate for a nurse to attend grand rounds or medical lectures at a teaching hospital?,"A few days ago we admitted a 63 y/o female with suspected ischemic bowel. She presented with bloody stools, HTN with systolics in the 180's/190's, dry heaves, and pain in her lower left quadrant. Past medical history was sparse, but I did receive information during report of occasional PVC's and sinus tach in the low 100's. 

While I cared for her, the plan was to observe while maintaining fluids, abx, and lowering her pain. She was given LR @100, vanc, cipro, Tylenol IV, Phenergan 6.25 PRN , zofran 8mg PRN, and fentanyl Q3. Not a ton of drips, but I definitely found myself in her  room quite a bit trying to play catch up with her ever increasing nausea, pain, and dry heaves.

The family was becoming frustrated at the lack of interventions as this was the weekend and our teams were cross covering. What struck me personally was just how helpless I felt in caring for this patient. Beyond just throwing meds at watching vitals, I had no way of understanding the entirety of her pathology beyond what my ""touchy feely"" nursing school taught us. 

Of course, I tried my best to jump in her room whenever I saw the surgical residents to get a better idea of her plan. However, the team was always slammed with patients to really give me any idea of what was happening. One of the residents mentioned that keeping her blood pressure somewhat elevated would increase her perfusion in the ischemic area, and in my mind I just kept thinking, ""Makes sense, but why exactly? Is giving hydralazine 10mg appropriate in this case?"".

It hit me when I got home that I really want to learn beyond what our hospital is willing to educate new nurses on. What is surprising is that, even being in a top 10 hospital does not afford to educate new nurses beyond feel good ""residencies"" that at most teach you EMR systems and how to be ""caring"". I want hard hitting pathology! I want to understand from established providers why I am performing these interventions in relation to hospital policy! In this way I can collaborate with the providers as a team member instead of just nodding my head and going along.

During one of our Mickey Mouse seminars, I saw all the medical students and residents going into a different lecture hall and cracked the door slightly to listen in. I would love to sit in on rounds or lectures on my days off to just to expand and push myself towards the top of what my license allows me to do.

Would this be appropriate for someone like me to inquire about? Or is it more of a closed door type of thing? 

**Edit**: I'm really happy to have woken up to this! I didn't think this post would get much traction! I'm fortunate in that I work with a lot of the med-students on my floor, so perhaps when I go into work I can ask who I need to speak to! 

And I also wanted to say Thank You to everyone who has sent me PM's and comments encouraging me to seek higher education based on this post!

medicine,"Case #5...? Your typical admit from the GI clinic, initially there for scant hematochezia, found to be dyspneic and hypoxemic","So a 40 something year old female presents to the ED as above for a few weeks of dyspnea, chest tightness, lower extremity edema and now intermittent fevers. She had a low grade glioma resected one month prior and completed a short steroid course. She’s on keppra as well as clotrimazole troches for a recently diagnosed candida eaophagitis. She’s admitted for some reason to the Obs unit febrile, taxhypneic to the 30s and hypoxemic to the high 70s requiring 4L NC. She’s started on CTX + Azithro. I pick her up about 36hrs later and she’s worsening. What do you do? What do you want to know?

Read through the comments overnight and I’ll touch on the main points that lost brought up and a few other thoughts.

She was on steroids for about a month total over the past few months, dexamethasone equivalents of pred 40 and was obviously cushingoid. No PJP ppx.

As most have pointed to, highest suspicion was for pjp. When I saw her I started bactrim and steroids. She couldn’t make sputum, even induced for cx and GMS stain for PJP. 

No risky behavior, and 4th gen HIV was neg. I did not pursue further immunodeficiency workup at that time but I really like the thoughts here and it’s probably something I would pursue IF she hadn’t just been slammed with steroids, but maybe I was naive thinking steroids were the sole agent driving immunosuppression.

So she gets treated and is markedly improved in 24 hours. At this point I thought the steroids had helped her the most. Her monospot was pos so i thought maybe an EBV pneumonitis, but capsid IgM was neg as was DNA.

She couldn’t get bronched (see below)

Sooo sent off a b d glucan and what do you know, &lt; 60 is wnl and hers was 3000+  helping to confirm the dx of PJP (not specific for pjp but has a very high NPV).",47,33,2018-06-21,PHARMA,0.07381749898195267,0.8976621627807617,0.028520336374640465

medicine,Tort (liability) reform and protections for medical professionals I would support as an attorney,"Standing in line at the pharmacy and hearing an irate customer drop f-bombs like crazy prompted me to post this. And of course the rx was for hydrocodone and someone else used his name to get pick it up...

First off, I don't do medical malpractice so I have no personal stake in tort reform in that regard. After reading about the [Prince family filing suit against an ER physician](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/arts/music/prince-overdose-wrongful-death-lawsuit.html) who saved his life and speaking to some of my colleagues about it, we all came to the same conclusion. It's ridiculous and shit like that gives legitimate attorneys a bad reputation. Incidentally, one of the attorneys for the plaintiff is also a PharmD. Personally, I think the attorney should be sanctioned by the court and if anyone deserves compensation, it's the physician and pharmacist listed as defendants.

Here's what I'd suggest:

1. The current standard of proof for negligence cases is generally by a preponderance of the evidence, which is legal jargon for essentially more likely than not. For cases involving prescription abuse/misuse, the standard should be elevated to clear and convincing evidence (a much higher burden) the physician knew or should have known the patient is abusing medications. Frankly, unless the physician is running a pill mill for controlled medications (which sadly I've actually seen), I don't really think a physician should be liable at all or subject to DEA bullshit. We definitely should not be turning physicians and pharmacists into investigators for drug seekers as if you folks don't have enough to worry about. If a patient abuses the trust a physician gives them, that's the patient's problem and they should bear the consequences entirely. Maybe I'm crazy, but I'd rather medical professionals spend their time treating legitimate patients.
2. For egregious cases like the Prince case, I would totally support the Plaintiff's attorney having to pay the attorney fees for the Defendant. It's embarrassing to me as a professional an attorney would even take that case and perpetuates the stereotype that attorneys are parasites that will sue for anything. 
3. Remove damage caps for suits against exploitative quacks, anti vaccine morons, etc. There's literally an ophthalmologist in Florida with a side practice treating MS with 100,000iu of vitamin D per day, charging a fortune for his services, and from my understanding that is dangerous, stupid, and unethical.

medicine,what is so wrong with a gap in my CV as a doctor?,"I went straight from high school to college to medical school to residency.  I am now 5 years out and somewhat burnt out at my current job.  Don't get me wrong, I still love psychiatry, but my current work environment is toxic, and where I was once inspired to tackle problems creatively, I now feel I am powerless to change anything.  I have little autonomy in my day-to-day, and am pressured to practice in a way I don't feel comfortable with. 

We are currently in the midst of hiring, and my chief has turned down a couple decent applicants simply for having ""holes in their CVs.""  I am curious what is so wrong with that?  What is this obsession with being continuously employed?

Honestly, I long to take 6-12 months off to work on myself.  To deepen relationships that have been neglected due to my hectic work schedule.  To get really good at speaking Spanish.

Wow, wow, wow. You have got to be kidding me... a BCMTMS? Will some pharmacists go to any lengths to expand the alphabet soup after their names? I've seen these BS board organizations pop up like the predatory ACMA which is administering BCMAS (which even students can get) and now we have BCMTMS... 

You know what, I'm gonna cash in on this too. I'm establishing the National Board of Counting By Fives. Will you seek the BCCBFST^(TM) (""Board Certified Counting-by-Five Specialist"")?

pharmacy,Hi. Can we talk about the way people are going to perceive pharmacists after the Walgreens situation?,"So a woman in Arizona was denied Misoprostol to induce abortion bc the pharmacist refused to fill it bc of her beliefs. Something I noticed is that a lot of articles and even my friends are spinning it in a way that makes it sound like the doctor is the all fucking father and if the doctor prescribes something then the pharmacist shouldn’t question it. 

Aaaaand this is why pharmacists are seen as the lesser professional and why we’re seen as monkeys. 

I understand why people are upset at the pharmacist for refusing to fill... but now the conversation has turned into... “well if the doctor has prescribed it who is the pharmacist to deny it”

But what the general population doesn’t understand is that pharmacists spend 4 YEARS learning about meds and how they interact in your system and if they deny a medication it isn’t alwaaays bc of the pharmacist’s beliefs. 

I mean... in this situation it is. But I just wanted to vent. My friend texted me about how pharmacists need to just fill bc the doctor knows what he/she is doing but there’s so much more to that 😔",90,98,2018-06-25,PHARMA,0.05563921108841896,0.9140435457229614,0.030317271128296852

medicine,Point of Care Ultrasound: The Next Physical Exam Tool,"So something I am very passionate about is point of care ultrasound. Long post ahead, but I just wanted to talk about what I have been working on: 

Perhaps the most important aspect of a physician’s role is our diagnostic capabilities.  Truly, if we cannot identify and diagnose a patient’s pathology, with reasonable accuracy, we cannot effectively treat them and may even cause greater harm.  On this topic let’s look back…. The year is 1816 and you are a physician evaluating a patient with shortness of breath.  The common practice of the time was direct auscultation by placement of the practitioner’s ear on the patient’s chest.  At the time, many criticized this technique as providing little insight in the patient’s condition as well being out of normal social standards.  Secondary to these pressures, that year, French physician, Dr. Rene Laennec, invented the stethoscope, which dramatically improved the clarity of the auscultation exam.  He spent the remainder of his career correlating how the stethoscope could detect various chest pathologies, and educating the utility of this technology on improving bedside assessment.  The accumulation of his works resides in his text *De l'Auscultation Médiate,* which is one of the most widely translated medical texts in history.

Now, just over two-hundred years later, it is incredible to think that this technology has not been *disrupted*, especially when you compare the advances mankind has made in other areas.  We have gone from the horse and carriage to cars that can practically drive themselves; from the notepad to the iPad, and can now communicate anywhere on the globe irrespective of language or distance.  In healthcare as well, we have drastically altered our ability to monitor as well as treat our patients.  

Yet despite all of our technologic advances, the stethoscope remains the primary tool used at the bedside for the physical exam.  This is in spite of the widely known inaccuracies produced by the stethoscope guided physical exam.  For example, studies have demonstrated dismal results regarding the ability of the stethoscope to detect common cardiac events with a reported accuracy of 20 to 40 percent.(1,2) Even amongst cardiologists the accuracy of the stethoscope is poor.(3) 

Acceptance of this concept is key for us to innovate. One simply needs to ask themselves: how do you tell the difference between rhonchi or rales? What section of the lung did you hear diminished breath sounds? Or, where is that heart murmur emitted from and what pathology does it represent to realize the severe limitations of the stethoscope?  Moreover, when you compare the scrutiny that we require all modern medical monitors to achieve for their accuracy (no one would use a pulse oximeter that had only a 40&amp;#37; percent accuracy rate), why do we not seek a similar level of accuracy when we discuss the tools we use for our physical exam?  Fortunately, technologic advances have recently allowed for a new technology to be evaluated as **an adjunct**for our physical ex**am, point of care ultrasound (POC**US).

Similar to the evolution of computers, ultrasound machines have become much more portable (some are even pocket size) with functionality similar to “high-end” units used in imaging laboratories.  New technologies even allow one’s smartphone to become an ultrasound device.  This innovation allows the physician to have access to ultrasound imaging during their physical exam at the point of care. 

The utility of POCUS has been demonstrated for nearly every type of physical exam including: cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, pulmonary, and abdominal.  How often have you wondered: what is the ventricular function, how severe is that aortic stenosis, how bad is the COPD, is there a pneumothorax, what is the amount gastric volume, or what is the patient’s volume status?  These are all questions that have proven to be answered “real-time” by POCUS.  

Sadly, the utility for POCUS to facilitate acute care management has mostly been shown in emergency medicine and critical care specialties.(4) This has been viewed with some criticism given the fact that patients have the same comorbidities and acute care events in the perioperative setting.(5) Truly, from a patient care standpoint, why should the skillset for bedside evaluation of the patient change simply because they transition from the emergency room or intensive care unit to the perioperative setting?  

Fortunately, the utility of POCUS to improve patient care in the hospital and ambulatory perioperative settings is starting to rapidly emerge.(6,7) Interest in perioperative point of care ultrasound (P-POCUS) has been reported by anesthesiology trainees along with integration of P-POCUS curriculums into residency training.(8) Moreover, implementation of a perioperative POCUS service has also demonstrated a positive clinical impact.(8) 

While it is encouraging to see the growth of P-POCUS there is much more that can be developed.  Other specialties have developed formalized educational and certification pathways.(5)  Emergency medicine has adopted POCUS training as a “core competency” for residency training. Currently, the certification and educational processes for the perioperative setting are limited, but the concept is growing.

A collaboration of academic programs including Loma Linda University Medical Center, UCI Medical Center, and UCLA Medical Center are working together to help address the need for education and training on this topic.  Every year, more academic programs are developing training curriculums on P-POCUS. 

One such curriculum, termed F.O.R.E.S.I.G.H.T. (Focused periOperative Risk Evaluation Sonography Involving Gastroabdominal Hemodynamic and Transthoracic ultrasound ) has been published as an effective strategy for education. This curriculum incorporates the topics of: 1) Cardiac, 2) Pulmonary, 3) Hemodynamic, 4) Gastro-Abdominal 5) Airway, 6) Vascular access, and 7) Intracranial pressure assessment and highlights their relevance for the perioperative setting.  To further P-POCUS education this curriculum is now online and is open access, under a Creative Commons license ([www.foresightultrasound.com](http://www.foresightultrasound.com/)).  Additionally, training workshops on this curriculum are now available as well at [www.pocuseducation.com](http://www.pocuseducation.com/).

medicine,Physicians in private practice: do you take cash/self-pay patients?,"I came across an old NYTimes article recently about physicians with cash-pay-only practices:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/your-money/dealing-with-doctors-who-accept-only-cash.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/your-money/dealing-with-doctors-who-accept-only-cash.html)

In reality, it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. For physicians in private practice, how do you handle patients requesting cash pay? 

Particularly today, with more patients in the US facing high deductibles, do you offer a direct pay option? Do you have a price list for services? What do you do if they ask? Do you pursue them, or are they a challenge to manage?",54,52,2018-06-28,PHARMA,0.02558567188680172,0.9157178997993469,0.05869636684656143

medicine,PCI is recommended within 12 hours of symptom onset AND within 60-90 minutes from first medical contact. I don't understand the reason why the 60-90 min clause is included.,"Shouldn't it be: PCI is recommended within 12 hours of symptom onset. Minimize this time (douh!) because the person is having a heart attack!

For example, these two contradictory cases:

Patient A: at -12 hours gets symptoms, seeks late medical attention and first contact at -5 hours, gets PCI within 90 minutes. Total time to get PCI was 8.5 hours.

Patient B:at -12 hours gets symptoms, seeks medical attention right away at -11 hours. Gets PCI within 120 minutes. Total time to get PCI was 3.0 hours. 

The guidelines could say: minimize one variable: total time from first symptom to PCI &lt; than 12 hours, then recommend PCI. The 60-90 min window is additional (irrelevant?) information.",26,32,2018-06-28,PHARMA,0.057612232863903046,0.9224647879600525,0.019922928884625435
