medicine,Are surgeons allowed to operate with mental health conditions?,"I'm curious at what point a surgeon in the United States is prohibited by law or code from operating. Obviously, if they have Alzheimer's or are drunk they can't be allowed to treat patients, but what about if they're just depressed? Schizophrenic? What about less common conditions, such as ASPD? Autism? How about possibly suicidal and seeing a therapist or on antidepressants without side effects that stop them physically from operating?

Health,I think I had a seizure but I don't know why and what I should do,"Alright so last night I was doing some typical computer gaming and my allergies started affecting my eyes. I'm allergic to my dog which causes my eyes to become inflamed. About a week ago my eye doctor proscribed lotemax to deal with the inflammation. I was told to use it 4 times a day for about 7-10 days. 9/1 was the last day I was supposed to use it. So after I noticed my eyes started to bother me it remembered i needed to use my eye drops one last time and it was about 11:50pm at this time. I took the one eye drop for each eye but then shortly after they started to burn which never happened before. It scared me so I rushed to the bathroom and flushed my eyes out with cool water. After that I started to feel disorientated. I went back down stairs and sat in front of my computer and at this point everything seemed really hazy and my thought process was starting to kinda slow down. I decided its time for bed shut down my computer and grabbed my water bottle and headed upstairs. I decided to make a quick bathroom break but by this time I felt like I was going to black out and just wanted to sit down. I sat down on my toilet and after that I was really out it everything seemed to be getting darker and I tried to feel my heart beat which I did but I felt two beats and then next thing I knew I was on the floor on my side laying on my water bottle with a small puddle of drool on the floor and my hand. I just laid in some what of a fetal position and slowly came to grips with a reality. It scared the shit out of me and it still does that I had a seizure for the very first time or something. I looked up the the side effects on my medication and it never said anything about seizures. I'm planning a doctors appointment with my physician and my eye doctor. Is their anything I should be concerned about at this very moment. And since its Labor Day I can't really do anything and I don't want a hospital bill.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for all of the insight and recommendations on what I should do I really appreciate it!

I went to my eye doctor he said that it couldn't be the steroid that was prescribed because it would have happened way earlier when I started taking the medication (about 8/22nd). He did say it could have been because of stress which i have been taking exams the this weekend and last Thursday 8/30th. He recommended seeing my Physician or if its a more serious matter a neurologist. I do have an appointment with my doctor already I'll update again as to what he diagnoses it as.",28,25,2013-09-02,PHARMA,0.08513172715902328,0.8873550295829773,0.027513248845934868

Health,"After years of anti-perspirant/deodorant issues, I finally found a solution :: One of those silly crystal deodorant rocks","Three years ago my body started rebelling against all deodorants and anti-perspirants. My pits would start flaring up with disgusting red sores which were usually blocked hair follicles. I tried varying various habits; reduced spicy food, changed my bathing from evening to morning and back again, and reducing bathing from everyday to every other. I moved from anti-perspirants to just deodorants, but everything caused minor to major rashes and/or sores.
So I have up on everything for the past 3 years. I've been extremely diligent in keeping my pits washed throughout the day, mainly to keep the funk down. In my non-deodorant life I only get a little sorey when I wear a suit for multiple days in a row. My wife and daughter say they can only notice any sweat scent when I'm out working for hours in the yard, so I have been okay with going au natural.
However, I need to be in a suit (and tie and pants, etc.) for many many days this next months and was not looking forward to it. So, on a whim last week I picked up a crystal deodorant stick. The kind that you wet and wipe all around your pits. Well, holy crap did it work. I'm only 3 days into using it, but the first day I spent running around the beach, the second in a suit and third day in a sweater have worked flawlessly. No rashes, no sores, very limited funk (more funk coming off the shirts that have lived through my phunk phase.).
I know, cool story bro. However, if this can help someone else find peace, reduce their funk and pain (sores were painful as hell), then my job is done.",14,32,2013-09-04,PHARMA,0.13614678382873535,0.8354213833808899,0.02843187190592289

Health,"Advice Needed: Tired with ""Brain Fog"" all the time","Last week, after being physically tired for literally years, I decided to have an energy drink. I rarely drink them, but I knew the next day was going to be rough, so I bought one the night before and had it the next day. I think it was Monster Khaos, or something like that.
Anyways, as a 29 year old male who is overweight, I am tired all the time. I literally cannot keep my eyes open at work, and it drives me crazy. I started an exercise routine over a month ago, and while I lost a little weight, I am not waking up.


I had weight-loss surgery a few years ago, gastric sleeve, and I lost a bit of weight, but I am always tired. I went to SEVERAL doctors for all kinds of testing, but they always tell me that I am fine. I have had my thyroid checked a bazillion times.


Being a weight-loss surgery patient, I know I need to eat a lot of protein, and I do have a protein drink everyday along with my multivitamins and a B12. Yet, it is still difficult to sleep well at night, even with exercise and eating a lot of healthy and fresh foods and I rarely feel awake, other than when I had the energy drink.


What can I do? The doctors said there is nothing physically wrong with me. I just feel tired. I have a routine of sleep and I am laying down for 7.5 hours a night. I feel too groggy if I get more than 8 hours. It is as if there is a fog or haze over my head all day long and it is getting harder and harder to concentrate and do my job, which mind you, is an easy job for me, as I have been doing it for a few years and love it.
I don't feel too stressed. Most of my stress comes from not being awake enough, and I would say that I am not depressed either, as I know exactly what that is like.


What should I do? Is there something in that energy drink that I am missing in my normal diet? I don't think it is good to drink energy drinks often, but there obviously was something in it that cleared the haze for a bit and I was able to concentrate a whole heck of a lot better.

I have never done drugs and never drank. I haven't found any cause yet, and I was referred in another posting to the CFS subreddit, but I noticed that it isn't something I want to be diagnosed with and I failed to find any conclusions about the energy drink in particular and why I snapped out of it for a day. 

EDIT: Feel free to comment more if you have any ideas, but before I forget, I wanted to thank everyone who posted so far. I appreciate all of your words of wisdom and I think I will start with some additional supplements and if it isn't better by say mid-November, I will take a trip off the island and see a doc about allergies and my thyroid and also if copper could be an issue.",117,37,2013-09-09,PHARMA,0.0643124058842659,0.9079450964927673,0.02774251438677311

Health,I start chemo in less than 12 hours. Scared.,"Short story: I have a very rare complication of lupus called vasculitis of the colon. I've tried and failed every other treatment that my very experienced rheumatologists (yes, two) have suggested. Starting tomorrow, I'm getting 500mg of cytoxan and 500mg of solumedrol every two weeks for at least three months. 

I'm scared of the solumedrol because it makes my mental health issues BAD. like I get hulk ragey for a good 24 hours, then ravenous for the next week, and then emotional and pain-ridden for the next couple of weeks, when I get my next infusion.  I have no idea what side effects I'll have from chemo.  So I'll either be puking and miserable or eating everything in sight and miserable tomorrow.  

I don't have a lot of IRL friends, and my husbent, while usually awesome, is terrible at this part of our life. Doesn't know how to be supportive, gets depressed and ragey himself.  We're in marriage counseling. 

I've been using trees to keep me calm - way better than ativan, but at this point, it's less than twelve hours away and I'm freaking out. I just feel like my life has spun out of control in so many ways. Starting in January, the lupus went insane, and I had to stop working at my dream job. I went from working 10-12 hour days on purpose to not being able to get out of bed, being hospitalized three times, one time everyone thought I was going to die. That was the same time my mom came from out of state to take care of me and she's nuts and went nuts on me and we had to send her home. I had to relearn to walk, write, and it took months for my cognition to be back to normal. 

I really want a second dog for company, but know this isn't the right time - I'm just not healthy enough to take care of an extra dog, but that's making me sad tonight. 

Sorry, I know that was just word vomit. I'm just sitting here, thinking I should pack my bag for tomorrow with my Ipad, phone, some fuzzy socks, maybe my pillow pet....but I'm just sitting here. 

I know what to expect from the steroids, but I think the fear of not knowing what the chemo will do is paralyzing me. I know it sounds dumb, but I keep thinking of things like, will it hurt during (not the infusion needle - those don't bother me and I have a dedicated vein for infusions), how will I feel after? Everyone says to be prepared to sleep for the next 2 days, but what does that mean? Will I sleep to avoid pain? Will I just be fatigued? How long do the side effects last? Like will I feel kinda crappy for a few days and then start to feel back to normal or better? How soon will I start to lose my hair? I've already grieved the whole infertility thing, but will I still get my period? Because if I can't have kids, I think it's only a fair tradeoff, lol.

Health,Why do some people need more sleep than others?,"I have met many people in my life who have no problem getting 5 hours of sleep and going about their day.  They might even be tired, but still they smile, laugh, and make a day out of it.  Also these people could go day after day only sleeping 5-6 hours and be completely fine with that.  In fact, they might never even have a ""sleep in"" day.  

This kid needs at least 7 hours to have a normal day.  If I had 5 hours of sleep I would be able to operate, but would be dimwitted and my concentration levels would be severely impaired.

I have heard of the ""sleep debt theory"", which states that the reason some made need to sleep more is simply because they have accrued so much lack of sleep over the years that they need to make up for it.  This doesn't make sense thought because I have always gotten 7-8 hours of sleep every night for as long as I can remember.",15,45,2013-09-13,PHARMA,0.08985056728124619,0.8750186562538147,0.03513072803616524

medicine,Drugs.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I have a confession /question for the Meddit community:

I am a doctor who also uses recreational drugs. 

I have taken drugs fairly regularly (once or twice a month or so at the weekends) since I was 18. I enjoy it, and I don't really see myself stopping. My use has never interfered with work. I have never mentioned it to anyone I do work with, but I know if anyone at work *knew* I would be in serious shit.

I have dabbled with a fair few other doctors who do the same, but I did not meet them through work. Since personal drug use is such taboo subject in medicine, I rarely have a conversation with anyone about it other than with my drug taking peers.

My question to the community is: do you think drug use is just as prevalent (but hidden) in the medical field as it is in the rest of society? From my experience, it is.

What do you guys think?  Do you think it is abhorrent and foolish, or do you see no harm as long as you are sensible?

For those who also take drugs, how has it worked out for you?",94,105,2013-09-16,PHARMA,0.08469967544078827,0.8911114931106567,0.024188892915844917

medicine,Opinion on a patient and guidance for a lowly intern,"Hey guys, anesthesia intern here...looking for guidance from my more veteraned colleagues.   I'm in my 3rd month of internship, currently on pediatric inpatient wards and doing my best to adapt to our volume (usually 30 patients/day with 8+ admits and discharges/day).  Each day I gain new respect for the fallibility of my knowledge, but the awareness at least gives me motivation to keep studying.   

The reason I'm posting is I wish to get an opinion from a physician more senior than myself on a case that struck me on an emotional level.  Let me begin by saying I'm not usually an emotional guy.  I've seen my share of horrible cases (rape, sexual abuse, DWI child fatalities, unexpected sudden cardiac death, etc..) and did a month on the palliative care service doing daily family death conferences so I feel I've developed as thick a skin as expected in an intern, but this case got to me (I'll give the outline without any identifiable information). 

This is a prebuscent male who presented in the past to our pedi inpatient service for vision loss.  We get a call at 6pm from a pedi resident pgy2 (btw, is known as a weak resident).   
""hey guys, I got this kid coming up, he's been here like 6 hours...Been seen like 6 times for migraines over the past month.  Nausea/vomiting several times over the past month with 4 day hx of blurry vision with darkening... Oh and a weird eye exam, blown pupils that are not really reactive"" 

At this point,  my upper level freaks out and I hear ""WTF? Call the optho and neuro attendings from home now!  You've been sitting on this kid for 6 hours?  What's wrong with you? I'll be down in 5 minutes.""  I had not heard the HPI at this point, my upper level tells us to handle the floor and runs out.

This kid comes up, and basic HPI as follows...prebuscent boy, Severe headache began a month ago.   Has had intermittent vomiting and blurry vision.  Mom has taken him to be seen a total of 7 times by various ER's and clinics (seen in our ER 2weeks ago)  over the past 30 days and been given a repeat diagnosis of migraines (mom has migraines).   His vision had been worsening, so much so that for a week he has had friends walk him around school by hand as he cannot see.  He presented to our ER with 4 days of agonizing headache, bilateral vision loss, and nausea/vomiting.   

Fast forward to him arriving on the floor.   I escort him up and am met by optho, Neurology, neurosurgery, and Pedi attending.   I do my best to give an adequate presentation (totally nervous with 4 attendings so concerned).   He gets in the room and after I present they huddle and began talking.   After about 15 minutes of questions I go in to check on him.   He's listening to ""The Lion King"" with the remote speaker to his ear, eyes facing the floor (at this point, I realized he can't see the TV screen).  His pupils are so dilated that there is only black (he has blue eyes).  Sweetest kid in the world and looks/acts just like my youngest brother.   He repeatedly thanks me for taking care of him and keeps apologizing that he can't see my face.  He tells me he can't wait to see again because he has sisters he has to take care of.  I smile and speak with the family, explaining our concern.   At this point, all the attendings file in and begin questioning, they get the same HPI as described above.   They do an eye exam, and I've never seen 4 attendings get so pale so quickly.   This previously healthy kid can see nothing bilaterally whatsoever, even with the pen light only a few centimeters from his orbit, and mother states it's been this way 4 days and that he had declining vision before and she was told ""migraines.""  She also states that, to her knowledge, an eye specialist was never contacted.  

We leave the room and I've never seen more livid attendings (thank God it wasn't my fault). The neuroro/optho attending can't believe they weren't contacted 2 weeks ago, in the first ER visit, for nausua/headache/blurry vision to evaluate for ICP.  They are even more pissed that this child sat in the ER for 6 hours and the resident didn't see blown, nonreactive pupils as an emergency.   

Long story short, steroids are initiated and multiple imaging studies are ordered.   A diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri with optic neuritis is made... But the general consensus from my superiors is that he will suffer irreversible optic nerve damage bilaterally, the extent unknown but with potential blindness.  I spend a lot of time with him/his family and say we're going to do everything we can, but my stomach is sinking the whole time.   I know the prognosis is poor and he'll likely lose the majority of his vision, but I don't know how to say this to the family, so I tell them we'll wait and see. 

I guess my question is, shouldn't this have been caught?  I realize his physical exam and pupil size/reactivity likely has changed over the past 30 days, but wouldn't the vigilant physician have considered an optho/neuro opinion for a case that screams textbook increased ICP?  I guess I'm having trouble accepting that several hospitals told this mom it was only migraines and it would pass, when it was getting worse and treatment could have been initiated earlier.   Or, am I just totally over analyzing this and letting my inexperience show?  For some reason or another, this patient hit me in a soft spot.  I've been revisiting this case several times in my mind and I'm just looking for advice, maybe for my own emotional reconciliation and as a clinical pearl to take forward.",14,35,2013-09-16,PHARMA,0.13565537333488464,0.837277889251709,0.02706670481711626

Health,[Serious] I have become very dumb over the past month. I'm worried I may have a brain injury or illness. Is this symptom common?,"I spent 5 minutes trying to figure out how to multiply 20 by 15 on paper. The way when you stack the numbers. I forgot you had to add a 0. 

I haven't been able to read out loud well at all. I mix up my words. And when writing I make tons of grammar errors and misspell words all the time. I've been having to look words up all the time.

I went to smoke a cigarette yesterday and I sparked it in the house. I have never done before.

I worked at Dunkin' Donuts for a little bit but quit because it completely stressed me out. I couldn't keep up with everything going on. I'd space out and never knew what I should have been doing at the time. It took me 5 days to learn what everyone else was learning in one day.

All these feelings of stupidity have been going on for two months. I  barely drink. There was one week this summer where I drank a good amount. I haven't smoked weed in 6 months.



However: 

1. My sleep schedule hasn't been great lately. I get sleep, but the times are scattered.

2. I was prescribed Lamictal, which is a mood stabilizer. &lt;- Edit (Wrote anti-depressant)

3. I just started going back to school again after a year.

4. I've been addicted to the internet lately. Scrolling through tons of text comments and reviews all the time.

I am constantly anxious that something is wrong with my brain.  I have never felt this feeling before. I just feel unusually dumb. I've always been an A/B student. Was great at math in the past. And could write decently.

Is this something I should be worrying about? Is it common? Lastly, how do I fix it?

tl;dr Is sudden chronic stupidity common.

Initial rhythm asystole. To sum the COR: quality CPR for 30 minutes, three rounds of epinephrine, intubation, without change. Here is where my question comes in two parts: her peripheral BGL came back low, in the 20's, without any history of diabetes why should this occur to cause the arrest, and is there any mechanism which would cause this post arrest? I administered IV dextrose, as well as Narcan, in order to rule out treatable causes, which brings to mind the next question: is there any evidence that IV dextrose or Narcan, or any other IV medications improve the outcome in a cardiac arrest prior to ROSC?

I'm a student in my final year of High School in Australia and am currently applying to universities. If you don't mind I'd like to ask a few questions as I'm interested in travelling down this pathway.

- Why did you choose to go into Medicine? Personal reasons, what you tell others, etc. 
- Why did you choose it over courses such as nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, etc.  
- Are you enjoying it? What are the best parts about your job?

My questions are aimed towards the positive but feel free to mention any negative aspects.

Thank you!

To those talking about graduate entry, I think I may end up having to go down that path. My UMAT score was good (97th percentile), however I don't think my ATAR will be high enough for any universities, as I'm sitting CIE A Levels and the conversion to ATAR is horrid... I think my GPA would be good enough, but I'm worried about GAMSAT.

medicine,Questions about IPEX syndrome.,"I work in EMS and encountered a patient today with IPEX syndrome. The patient was a 17 year old male, having been diagnosed 10 years ago.

He reported an acute onset of ""shaking"" and chills with a low-grade fever that began about an hour prior to our contact. He stated the fever was 99 axillary just prior to our arrival. He reported that he was in the hospital 2 months ago due to sepsis. 

The hospital that cares for him is about 90 minutes from our area. Unfortunately, we encountered a lot of problems in getting him to an ED, and ended up flying him to his primary facility. By the time we transferred care 20-30 minutes later, his fever was 102.5 axillary (though his original may not have been accurate), and his heart rate increased from around 100 to 130-140. 

Is this typical in IPEX patients? What kind of timeline do we have to work with? Unfortunately, there isn't too much information that I could find online in regards to emergency treatment and I think it's important to have an understanding of it, at least on the EMS level, as he lives in our district.

Health,"A reasonable, compassionate MD speaks about e-cigs.","This is the text of the article:

Hello and welcome. I'm Dr. George Lundberg, and this is At Large at Medscape.

""Tobacco is a dirty thing and so is alcohol. Into my mouth they will not go; when tempted, I'll say NO."" I had that little ditty drilled into my head for years, at home, at Sunday school, even in public school.

Did it work? No, but it did delay my beginning these habits. I learned to drink in medical school -- peer pressure, of course. I tried to learn how to smoke in the Army -- peer pressure, of course -- but I never could learn how to inhale successfully, so I never got hooked.

But how about all those hundreds of millions of Americans who did successfully inhale and got hooked, either immediately if young enough, or after many efforts at inhalation if older? Of course they did not get hooked on tobacco; they got hooked on nicotine. Cigarettes are simply the dispensing agents.

What is it in tobacco that kills nearly 450,000 Americans each year? A host of noxious, toxic, fellow-traveling chemicals -- not the nicotine itself.

Then why not simply provide those hopelessly hooked tobacco addicts with the nicotine they must have without all those carcinogens and other nasty toxins?

Great idea. Does that work? Well, it does if the slope of the blood nicotine uptake is steep enough to produce the hard-hitting charge that the nicotine addict must have. How about nicotine gum? It works poorly. How about lozenges? Not good enough. Patches? No, too bland. Intravenous nicotine could work, but there's potential for infections. An inhaler? Now you are getting closer.

Maybe these devices called e-cigarettes? They produce a high nicotine content vapor that's inhaled and is reported to produce a serious nicotine rush, similar to that produced by inhaling smoke from burning tobacco.

Sounds pretty good.

Because tobacco deaths don't come from nicotine, maybe we could rescue some 450,000 Americans a year from premature death secondary to tobacco use by making e-cigarettes available to tobacco addicts.

Yeah. Maybe we could. That would be called harm reduction. It could also be called compassionate therapy. Who could oppose that? A lot of folks are antitobacco zealots and they say to the tobacco addicts, ""Quit or die!"" Ooh. Huge numbers can't quit, so they die, prematurely.

Have the e-cigs been subjected to a great deal of short- and long-term scientific scrutiny? Not yet. Well, they should be.

There are many regulatory hurdles awaiting e-cigarettes on their way toward approval, including success at smoking cessation; potential toxicity for the user; any possible harm to people nearby the user; the potential for developing new nicotine addicts via this method of nicotine delivery; possible destigmatization of tobacco; age limits; and the best ways to advertise, market, sell, and tax this new family of products.
Meanwhile, we the public and we the public-health folks ought to cool it and just let the tobacco addicts, who are going to get their nicotine rush any way they can, use e-cigs rather than burn tobacco and inhale its smoke. It strikes me as immoral to try to prevent them that access. 

Right? Right.

That's my opinion. I'm Dr. George Lundberg, at large for Medscape.

medicine,Zebras in the ED (a case study).,"Ok, as the title suggests this is an absolutely whacked out case I saw last night in the ED.  I will update with our final diagnosis tonight around 10pm before I head back in.

Here's the rundown:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24 y/o male presents to ER with complaint of right arm pain, cold hands, and bluish coloration of skin for the past 6 hours.  

**ROS** is negative excepting complaints above.  The patient has no medical conditions and no prior surgeries/hospitalizations.

The patient lives at home with his mother in a residential area. He works at a strip club as a dishwasher and attends a local college.  He denies any drug, tobacco or alcohol use.  He denies any recent exposure to chemicals/medications outside of everyday cleaning supplies while at work.

**Vitals** - BP 140/89, RR 18, HR 84, O2 sat 97%, temp 98.9

**Physical Exam**    
- Head normocephalic, atraumatic.  PERRLA, though pupils are noted to be dilated. Sclera are anicteric with normal pigmentation. CN 2-10 grossly intact.  AAOx3                
- ENT is unremarkable, OP is clear with no discoloration.  There is no edema of face or upper extremities.              
- Heart is RR&amp;R w/ no M/R/G, +S1/S2                
- Lungs CTAB with good air movement             
- Abd is nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds            
- Extremities have 4/4 strength bilaterally, no edema, erythema or pain to palpation. Peripheral pulses are strong universally.                 
- Skin has a bluish hue that (per triage nurse) was initially restricted to the LUE but now appears on bilateral UE, along the nape of the neck and anteriorly to the suprasternal notch.                 

Baseline labs including CBC, CMP, UA, all return **within normal limits**.  

Drug toxicity is **positive for benzos**.  

As the triage nurse preps the patients arm for IV placement she notices the bluish discoloration is transferred to the alcohol wipe.  The patient's arm is cleaned with more alcohol wipes, and the normal pigmentation is seen. However, when the physician returns to talk to the patient several minutes later he observes the bluish discoloration has returned to the cleaned areas.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, start shooting! (Feel free to ask about anything I may have left out, I'm typing after a 12 hour overnight)


-----------------------------------------------------------         
**Grand finale (sort of)**


Ok, strong work in the thread everyone. I wish I was following up on this guy so I could tell you definitively.  

To answer some specific questions:

1. His arm pain was later determined to have a physical mechanism. He strained it earlier in the week.
2. He was negative for TCAs.
3. Pulses were strong and O2 sat normal, so we dismissed cyanosis. Therefore we didn't go for art/venous US.
4. His hands were slightly cold, but not remarkable.  Could be secondary to his drug use or hypertension/anxiety.  

As /u/AlHanQuolo called, we went with a presumptive diagnosis of pseudochromhidrosis. Following about 4 hours of obs in the ED with no changes in his VS/mental status he was discharged with instructions to clean his skin with hibiclens and he was referred to dermatology.

The underlying cause of the pigmentation  was undetermined, but the guy was stable so he will receive a full work-up outpatient.

So, I'm in a bit of a pickle because for the life of me, I cannot figure out what this lady is saying.  I  have a pretty decent understanding of all sorts of different terminology due to the nature of my profession, but I've been puzzled in a few different places, and Google/medical terminology sites have been less than helpful, lol.

To give some context, she's reading from her medical notes regarding a surgery she performed to remove a pterygium from somebody's eye.  Unless it's a more general medical term, everything so far has related in some way to ophthalmology.

If anybody recognizes an actual medical term from my crude, phonetic spelling of what these terms sound like to me, I'd greatly appreciate your input!


Here are the terms I'm having trouble with, with the phrases they've been mentioned in for some context (where possible):

""The conjunctiva was **pictally** dissected from the superior bulbar conjunctiva, making sure the tendon tissue was not incorporated.""

**Pictally?** - What?!


The last two, I can't really give context to because I'm having trouble with the entire sentence, lol...

""a **pregerial** removal"" 

**Pregerial** - Not Progeria syndrome.  Checked that already, lol.


""performed a **fissarian** excision""

**Fissarian** - Where the ""ss"" is pronounced like the ""ss"" in ""fissure"".

Keep in mind that these are the crude phonetic spellings of the terms I cannot for the life of me figure out, so maybe they're even two separate words I've accidentally combined through the wonders of complete and total ignorance, haha.

I remembered this recently and asked my mum about it, but she's a bit sketchy on the details. I would have been less than 10, but probably not by a huge amount, and the only symptom was serious discomfort whenever I ate solid food. It wasn't bad enough to make me cry or anything but I'd seriously regret eating.

It wasn't a problem at other times, to the extent that I would keep forgetting about it and accidentally eat something. Eventually a doctor recommended foods like yoghurt and soup and gave me a bottle of pink medicine, but I can't remember what that was.

If anyone could identify what this is, I'd be grateful to hear about it.

**EDIT:** The pain was confined to my tongue, though the whole top of my tongue would experience it. It was a tingling/stinging pain and I would probably only rate it at a 5. It would only occur when I tried to eat solid food and would cause sufficient discomfort that I would be unable to continue eating. Foods like yoghurt would not cause this problem.

I was about 10 years old and at that age, I ate a pretty good diet of home cooked food, I can't think of anything that was obviously problematic there. I didn't drink alcohol or smoke or use any drugs or consume caffeine. Fast food was a rarity.

I was an active child and would often be running around, doing sports.

I was at school at that age and had no other job. I was not sexually active.

I had experienced no major illnesses, never hospitalised, no allergies, an all-round healthy child.

I know geography influences what disease are found in an area, so if it helps, I have lived my whole life in England. At that age, the furthest I had travelled from home was France.

I can't remember how long it lasted for but a doctor gave me some medicine for it and it went away. I can't remember anything about the medicine other than that it was pink and liquid.

medicine,Question about brain surgery.,"So i watched a movie the other day called ""Gifted Hands""  it is about Dr. Carson, he is still the acting chief of peds neuro surg at johns hopkins i think.  In it he performed a procedure to separate occipital craniopigus twins.  To do this procedure with minimal blood loss he put both babies on bypass.  

What does't make sense to me is this:  The whole point of putting them on bypass was so he could stop their hearts, stop hearts = no blood moving in the body thus  no bleeding in the brain during separation.  But the whole point of bypass is to keep blood moving throughout the body during surgery (since bypass is obviously used during open hearts most of the time, it is simply a means of keeping the body perfused while the heart is stopped for repair).  During Dr. Carson's procedure he turned off the bypass machines for around an hour so he could do some delicate vascular work in the brains of the children (this is where the minimal blood loss part comes in).  My question is this:

How can you get away with turning off the heart lung bypass for that long, doesn't your brain begin to suffer damage after like 10 mintues of oxygen deprivation?  If he had the by pass machines off for an hour then what was perfusing the children's brains with oxygen for that time or is cooling the body down during bypass what allows this?",26,57,2013-09-28,PHARMA,0.062138594686985016,0.9096485376358032,0.028212832286953926

* Sore throat 
* Furious pain swallowing 
* Swollen lymph nodes 
* Headache 
* Vomiting 
* Red and blotchy mouth/back of throat 

The sore throat has been there for a few days, but woke me up today and has kept me awake since 5 (now 7:30am.) I just told my mom I have strep and she believes me, but said she won't take me to the doctor because ""antibiotics are bad."" She's a right wing anti-vaxxer, so I honestly don't give any credibility to her medical statements. 

I told her about the possible complications and she just shrugged it off like they weren't a big deal. 

I don't want infection of the: 

* Tonsils 
* Sinuses 
* Skin 
* Blood 
* Middle ear 

Nor other complications such as: 

* Scarlet fever 
* Inflammation of the kidney 
* Rheumatic fever 

What do I do?

Health,Sciatica is rapidly ruining my life.,"Im 25 years old and spent 6 months sitting in an office chair moving oil for 12-13 hours a day(I got 1 or 2 days off a month)

I have to imagine this is what triggered my condition as I've always been in good physical shape. I no longer have this job. I started feeling the slight pain now and then a week or two before I left the job, but did not attribute it to the job. Im now without health insurance and am contracting work when I can

The pain started 4 months ago and I'm now at the point where getting out of bed to get groceries is a mental debate. 

I'm just laying out my sob story because I desperately need some sort of advice to help myself. Ive traid NSAIDs(naproxen and ibuprofen) but both do very little for pain and wreck my digestive system. Ive tried heat pads/ice and they seem to just take my mind off of pain slightly and on the temperature. 

Ive tried some stretches I've found online but I'm at the point now where I cant even do a pushup without failing due to pain let alone spine stretches 


I dont know what exactly I'm asking. I dont have access to health care(I'm in a rural, conservative area that demands insurance and if not, payment up front for non-emergencies). I guess I'm just looking for advice as I squirm in bed going out of my mind because I've been in constant pain for months and havent had a full night of sleep since I dont know when",42,50,2013-09-29,PHARMA,0.0814710408449173,0.8902217745780945,0.028307151049375534

Health,I struggle through life in a constant spaced-out fog. Why?,"It makes me depressed and poor. I've quit jobs and quit school many times because of it. Half the time I just can't focus and the other half I feel like I'm having low-grade seizure activity in my brain. 

I've worked in radiology and have had unofficial non-contrast CT and MRI scans of my brain and didn't see anything significant. I've been on prescription adderall, Ritalin and Wellbutrin at different times and didn't notice any positive changes. 

Can /r/health give me a differential diagnosis of what is ruining my life? Thanks!

Edit: Several people are suggesting a whole foods/gluten-free diet. How long does that normally take to kick in?

Health,"I have suffered from chronic back pain since my early teens. Now, at 22, and with thousands of dollars spent on chiropractic treatments with no improvement, I need to know what steps i can take to improving my condition.","My parents put me through chiropractic treatments since I was 6. I've personally dropped upwards of $15,000 in the past 4 years on them. Although I'm pretty certain that my chronic pain is getting more frequent and more painful.
