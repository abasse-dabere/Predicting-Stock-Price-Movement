medicine,Care of incarcerated patients,"I'm caring for an incarcerated patient right in the hospital now, which means he's handcuffed to the bed and has two guards at bedside at all times. He isn't allowed to make phone calls. He was upset that his family didn't know he was in the hospital so I offered to call and update his family, which one of the guards promptly informed me was not allowed without permission from the warden for security reasons which makes sense (e.g., would not want the buddies of a violent gang member finding out he was in the hospital and coming to bust him out). Today, I told the patient he might be leaving today and was informed that I'm not allowed to tell him that, I have to tell the guards first and get their permission to tell the patient. Has anyone encountered this kind of thing before? This seems like a blatant restriction of *my* free speech and I would be surprised if it's an actual enforceable law/statute. More importantly it interferes with my duty to my patient as I need to be able to speak with him openly about the plan of care and follow up. Curious to hear if anyone has had similar experiences. I'm in the USA.

Disclaimer: I'm not looking for legal advice here, I know where to find the lawyers of reddit if I need them.

Edit: Wow, I appreciate all the replies. Clearly this is a patient population that I've been naive in caring for up until now. I've definitely gained a better understanding of the risks posed by over-disclosure, and while it still feels contrary to my personal code to keep a patient in the dark, I get it. Will definitely look into tracking down my hospital's policy guidelines for care of incarcerated patients as some have suggested.",113,313,2019-12-01,PHARMA,0.03691845387220383,0.9273017644882202,0.035779763013124466

biotech,Things you can do now to prepare for your first job in biotech,"During my PhD and postdoc I often felt like I was just treading water, not moving forward, not getting any closer to finishing or getting my first ""real"" job. It was those times, when my research was at a standstill, that I tended to dive into career development activities - seminars, tweaking my resume, reading job postings, etc. I became slightly obsessed with how I could prepare for my next position before I had even finished my current one. It was a kind of productive distraction.

Now, after a successful job search and about 1.5 years working happily in biotech, I can confidently say that *some* of that distraction really DID help prepare me for industry. After talking to a bunch of current students and postdocs a career event recently, I discovered that lots of other people were wondering the same thing I had been: *What can I be doing NOW to prepare myself for my first job in industry?*

I wrote this article as a resource for forward-looking PhD students and postdocs who are eager to prepare for a job in industry, but not sure where to start. I hope you find it helpful!

medicine,How can I express my appreciation to my physician who is also a coworker?,"Alrighty, so I‘ll try to ask this without getting too personal. I am a RN that works pre-op/PACU at a small community hospital. I’m fairly new in my career and definitely young compared to my peers. 

I have a physician who had been incredibly supportive the past year or so. Admittedly, I am a terrible patient (aren’t we all) as in I have the *worst* white-coat syndrome, thus making her job more difficult. I’m a pain in the butt, I know it. I feel bad every visit, but have been a nervous patient since childhood and can’t help it. 

Anyways, I had surgery with this physician about a year ago. She was at my side in the OR until I fell asleep (which now that I work there, I know it’s not her norm). She’s also been incredibly patient and supportive every office visit despite frequent appointments, my nerves, and indecisiveness. 

I am blessed beyond belief to have her as my provider, and honored to work alongside her. I plan to continue to use her for routine care, but I want to express my gratitude to her... but also feel awkward doing it and seeing her professionally on a weekly basis. I’ve always been someone that has a hard time expressing my feelings. 

Suggestions? Just tell her? A card?

medicine,Rant: Don't belittle your colleagues.,"I'm a PGY-5 in general surgery, and I witnessed two striking examples of unprofessionalism yesterday, and I'm ashamed of both of them.

In the first case I overheard a pair of GIM PGY2s loudly venting about the substandard care given to a patient by a hospitalist service. Have I vented like that? Absolutely. But they came to the conclusion that they would never want to be admitted to any service other than GIM in the hospital because nobody else is a real doctor and will kill you. And they were in a very public place surrounded by other doctors and patients.

In the second case my junior for the night, a PGY1 in neurosurgery, spent 20 minutes ranting to me about how useless and meaningless his 1 month rotation of general surgery is to him...in the middle of us doing an emergency total colectomy at 2 am. I was gently probing him to see if he could find any value in working with his colleagues, or if his patients ever experienced general surgery problems, and he just couldn't fathom why he'd been put through this torture. Nevermind the patient in extremis in front of him.

My team has been super stressed lately and I found my lead technician is having problems with following direction. They have stopped multitasking and just refuse to do anything but what they feel is right. And additional responsibilities have been thrown back in our faces. My staff pharmacist says they spend more time then necessary with patients and dont cut conversations short. They also use the excuse of pharmacists counseling patients for extended periods as reasoning behind their lengthy chat, the pharmacist does it, why can't I? 

I've coached this technician recently and the situation has just gotten worse. We've talked about their personal expectations and what they think they bring to the team. What we as pharmacists can do to help the team. What they feel they can do to support the team. I've also told this technician they are the defined leader of the many technicians we have and that the lead technician sets and example for them. 

One of the biggest thing they have been doing is making promises they can't keep, or promises on behalf of the pharmacist. Such as maintenance C2s ready in 10 minutes when my queue is full of child ABX and post  surgical acute. Or they will call insurance immediately for a vacation override on medications not needed for a few days.  They dont have to do inventory tasks or filing as the pharmacists took that on. 

I dont believe writing up this technician will be of any help and will only put more distance between the team. They understands that I'm friendly but I'm their boss and not their friend. I always acknowledge good behaviors (that I witness). I always make sure they have their breaks. 

My thoughts otherwise:
Use my own time to shadow the technician and do some ""show me/teach me"" exercises. 

Ask for their input as the best way to train the new technicians, outside work and paid.

Use some sort of recognician board to reward those who are motivated and hope they follow the team?

___________________________________



[Verse 2]

My hands are shaky, my knees are weak

I can't seem to stand on my own two feet (**hypotension hypoxemia**)

I'm breathing but I'm wheezing, feel like I'm emphysem-ing (**bronchospasm**)

My throat feels like a funnel filled with [Weet-Bix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weet-Bix) and kerosene and (**upper airway angioedema**)

Oh no, next thing I know they call up triple-0

I'd rather die than owe the hospital 'til I get old (**socioeconomic barriers to healthcare access**)

I get adrenaline straight to the heart (**epi 0.3mg IM**)

I feel like [Uma Thurman post-overdosing kick start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpMxpzfSRUA&amp;t=1m25s)

Reminds me of the time when I was really sick and I

Had too much pseudoephedrine and I couldn't sleep at night (**adrenergic side effects**)

Halfway down High Street, Andy looks ambivalent

He's probably wondering what I'm doing getting in an ambulance

The paramedic thinks I'm clever 'cause I play guitar

I think she's clever 'cause she stops people dying

Anaphylactic and super hypocondriactic

Should've stayed in bed today, I much prefer the mundane

I take a hit from an asthma puffer (**b2 agonist**)

I do it wrong, I was never good at smoking bongs

I'm not that good at breathing in

I'm not that good at breathing in

medicine,Journal Club: Vitamin D and depression,"With thanks to u/FuzzyKittenIsFuzzy and [a post in a previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/eaywzb/frail_older_patients_struggle_after_even_minor/fb3mcwt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), which I think deserves attention.

The initial paper is [Efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in major depression: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6515787/).

&gt;Results:  
&gt;  
&gt;A total of four trials involving 948 participants were included in the study. In three trials, the intervention group received oral vitamin D supplementation whereas in one parenteral vitamin D was given. Pooled mean effect size for vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptom ratings in major depression was 0.58 (95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.72). The *I*2 value for heterogeneity was 0 suggesting low heterogeneity among studies. Egger plot intercept indicated minimal publication bias.  
&gt;  
&gt;Conclusion:  
&gt;  
&gt;Vitamin D supplementation favorably impacted depression ratings in major depression with a moderate effect size. These findings must be considered tentative owing to the limited number of trials available and inherent methodological bias noted in few of them.

That's good. Actually, that's good enough that I was immediately skeptical.

Here are the studies analyzed:

[Efficacy of High-Dose Supplementation With Oral Vitamin D3 on Depressive Symptoms in Dialysis Patients With Vitamin D3 Insufficiency: A Prospective, Randomized, Double-Blind Study.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27022679)

Salient points: this is carried out in dialysis patients.

&gt;After 52 weeks, the depressive symptoms were not significantly improved in the test group... versus the control group.

But they did find improvement in vascular depression, for what that's worth. Still, this study's inclusion in the meta-analysis immediately makes me skeptical, because they're pooling a very different population. It doesn't necessarily violate their protocol, but I'm not sure this is good statistical behavior.

[Vitamin D Supplementation Affects the Beck Depression Inventory, Insulin Resistance, and Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial.](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/146/2/243/4584832)

&gt;**Results:** ...A trend toward a greater decrease in the BDI was observed in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group (−8.0 and −3.3, respectively, *P* = 0.06).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Conclusion:** Overall, vitamin D supplementation of patients with MDD for 8 wk had beneficial effects on the BDI...

I don't think the conclusion is justified by the results. It's a small trial (20 people in each arm, of whom 18 in each completed the study), so that's suggestive, but you can't conclude when you didn't reach significance due to underpowered trial. Still, grist for the larger meta-analysis.

[The effect of 2 different single injections of high dose of vitamin D on improving the depression in depressed patients with vitamin D deficiency: a randomized clinical trial.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609390)

The name says it: this is vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D deficiency. I'm not surprised that it helped, and it confirms that vitamin D deficiency can contribute to depression, but not that depression per se can be improved by vitamin supplementation. Again, the inclusion of this study looks to me like something that negatively affects generalizability.

[Therapeutic effects of vitamin D as adjunctive therapy to fluoxetine in patients with major depressive disorder.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23093054)

I don't have access to the paper, just the abstract. They say the results are positive without anything more specific. That's encouraging, I guess! I can't really evaluate the study, which is too bad, because this is probably the most real-world useful result.

&amp;#x200B;

And two studies were excluded but are important:

[Vitamin D Supplementation and Depression in the Women’s Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D Trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385159/)

&gt;The findings do not support a relation between supplementation with 400 IU/day of vitamin D3 along with calcium and depression in older women

[Treatment with hormone therapy and calcitriol did not affect depression in elderly postmenopausal women: no interaction with estrogen and vitamin D receptor genotype polymorphisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319337/)

The title gives this one away: ""In elderly post-menopausal women there was no effect of hormone therapy and calcitriol either individually or in combination with depression.""

These are two much larger, negative trials, although they don't neatly map into the criteria. Just like including the first trial (Wang et al.) gives  huge boost to number studied, these two would really drag down the results.

Overall, if you drop Wang (unless you're treating dialysis patients), what I think is a reasonable take-home is that it's worth testing for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency and treating. It's low-risk and potentially beneficial anyway! In non-insufficient patients, however, I don't see data to justify the strong conclusion of the meta-analysis.

1. **loans -** we are graduating w/ absurd loan burdens at high interest rates
2. **inevitable changes in reimbursement** \- the current system is unsustainable. we all know this to be true. i expect significant change in reimbursement over the next few decades. how much lower? who knows... but i'd bet my loan burden it will be much less than what docs are making today 
3. **opportunity cost** \- the OC of medicine is immense. we miss out on 10-15 years in the market. any of our frugal non-medicine peers earning salaries even half of what a GP makes will be far ahead financially by the time we have real, meaningful paychecks. further, we rely on the latter half of our careers to come out ahead. and given point #2, if we don't see our 'pay day' so-to-speak, we will never catch up.

medicine,How often do you see elements of conversion disorder in your practice?,"I recently cared for a young woman who was diagnosed with functional neurological disorder.  She was extremely impacted by it to the point of cachexia, heart failure, and multiple codes, two of which occurred on my floor alone.  Obviously her case was quite extreme, as her family's beliefs about folk medicine caused them to delay seeking care until the damage was largely irreversible.  

Not a single one of her caregivers were willing to accept it as her diagnosis.  They were willing to believe her issues were stemming from a couple of far less likely scenarios that I won't detail for reasons of confidentiality, but trust me when I say that they were outlandish at best.  Her outcome was very poor, and even though we discharged her months ago I still think of her occasionally.  She'll be one of those rare patients that stick in the back of my mind for a long time.

I don't have much experience dealing with these types of patients due to the kind of floor I work on, but discussing her case with the neurology team was very eye-opening to me.  It got me wondering about how common this type of disorder really is.

medicine,"How do you talk to ""naturopathic doctors"" who refuse (for their spouse who is the patient, I might add), evidence based guideline driven therapies?","I had an episode recently where we had a fairly young hypertensive patient who happened to undergo a stress echo via hospitalist, only to find it's significantly abnormal and he needs a left heart cath. I spent like 20 min in the room discussing plans, risk vs benefits and expectations post PCI (in short, TAKE YOUR ANTIPLATELETS), and the wife jumps in. ""Excuse me, I'm a naturopathic DOCTOR.""

She then proceeds to tell me she is totally against multiple antihypertensives regardless of what they are for (i.e. against bbl/ace-i/aldactone in cardiomyopathy) and will never let her husband touch a statin. I started to get extremely irritated because he had BPs in the 180s/100s and she started refusing his antihypertensive therapy in hospital because ""you're overloading him, his body is going to reject those toxins, look at how high you've driven up his blood pressure and not let him EAT, my god his body is all out of balance.""

Yeah okay lady if your magic herbs can fix his problems why did you bring him into the ER in the first place?

pharmacy,Where will the line be drawn?,"I had to dust off the throwaway for this one. 

On a conference call, the district manager mentioned that the incidence of prescription errors across the company as a whole has increase recently. They made a point to say that within a certain timeframe (or region? Area? I couldn’t focus on the call 100% because I had to take it in the pharmacy) there had been FOUR DEATHS due to prescriptions being sold to the wrong person. 

The DM used this as a motivator to have everyone review standard operating procedures for picking up a prescription and seemed to suggest it was due to technicians simply skipping steps just because; the error must be due to the staff and not anything corporate has done. 

But what seems painfully, glaringly obvious to me is that in the past 6 months, my company has cut back pharmacist overlap and technician hours while adding on tasks that do not directly contribute to the actual practice of pharmacy. We are expected to attempt 100% of the list of phone calls that generate every day (usually over 30 calls a day) and have “meaningful” conversations with patients about adherence while still completing the same volume of prescriptions - or more - with LESS staff than I’ve ever seen. If you don’t reach your targets, you get put on a performance improvement plan. If you don’t improve, you get fired. Let’s not even get started on immunization quotas. 

So every task that has to be done is rushed. Every register transaction is rushed. And because the staff is stressed and overwhelmed and constantly interrupted from the time they clock in until the time they clock out, mistakes are made. If there’s one thing you SHOULD do correctly all day it’s verifying that the person you’re selling the bag to is the person who is intended to receive it. But when you put people into these high pressure situations with the bare minimum of support, mistakes are going to happen. They HAVE been happening. 

If four people have died from getting the wrong prescription, how many other instances happened that didn’t result in lasting harm to the patient? How many times is considered acceptable by almighty corporate? Do they really think it’s because we collectively just decided to stop following proper procedures or could it possibly be because they’ve actively taken steps to distract us from the core function of our jobs?

Is it really such a big “win” that adherence calls increase PDC by 5% if the number of people who you kill in your career goes up by 1?",114,338,2019-12-19,PHARMA,0.11819474399089813,0.8574008941650391,0.024404378607869148

We have been seeing this pt for several years. Their BP was being controlled with Chlortalidone. No other meds. PT reports no alcohol or illicit drugs.


They recently lost their employer provided health insurance and have not had their diuretic in about 2 months. They use an app to log their BP bid. At first when meds were dc, we saw the BP in the logs rise as expected. Then, readings started to drop and have stabilized within normal limits. 

PT claims the only change is a daily multivitamin and an extra Magnesium supplement to help with mild depression symptoms. No weight loss. No dietary changes... in fact, pt reports having difficulty adhering to DASH.

I've read that Magnesium can help with hypertention, but I did not expect to see a 15-20 pt systolic decrease. Can anyone help me understand the mechanism? Thank you.

Edit to add: pt reports increased stress and depression as a result of becoming unemployed.

medicine,Cultural conflict and provider distress,"Hey team,  
  
I have a patient story I feel like I need to talk out. For some background, I'm an IM resident and I plan to do a fellowship in palliative care. My undergraduate degree was in anthropology, so I feel like I have a good background in cultural competency and recognizing ethnocentrism. I've been peripherally involved in the care of this patient.  
  
I'll try to keep it to minimal identifying details. The story goes, little old lady comes in to the hospital (for what is at this point irrelevant). She's bedbound, now minimally interactive, on dialysis. Lots of discomfort/pain with repositioning and care, pretty much always looks uncomfortable at baseline. I've seen plenty of folks like this, and they're a big part of my motivation for going into palliative care. Where the story gets tricky is her family situation and GOC. Of course she's had plenty of family meetings about her situation - the family wants to continue her dialysis even though it causes her discomfort (occasionally to the point of needing restraints). As I understand it, they believe that her suffering is helping with her sin, so in that sense, it is a good thing.  
  
I'm floored by this. I see where the cultural conflicts lie and I can see why they feel this way, but her situation is sticking in my gut. I've run up against an ethnocentric line that runs parallel with my training and my motivation as a physician. Luckily this is not my patient so I don't have responsibility or a direct stake in what's going to happen to her. But, I'm planning on a career in palliative care. I am going to run into families like hers. I feel like I'm pretty good at cultural competency, but this is just beyond me.

medicine,Quality Assurance and Professionalism in the Workplace,"Hey meddit, I have a few problems that I would really appreciate some feedback from other medical professionals. I am a travelling contract echocardiographer and I am currently at an IAC accredited hospital which I have found serious concerns about the diagnostic quality of the echoes preformed and the lack of professionalism in the workplace.

&amp;#x200B;

Multiple cardiologists at this location have asked me how to improve the echo lab. To do so, I gathered data on 52 patients that I scanned and compared my work to the previous echo and evaluated the technical aspects, completeness of information, timing and quality of the workup in situations of disease. What I found was alarming. 

&amp;#x200B;

41% of the studies I found serious technical concerns that potentially misdiagnosed, improperly diagnosed or failed to diagnose a significant finding, which was attributed to poor quality information or lack of information. 3 of those cases the patients were re-hospitalized for cardiac concerns. One case, the patient almost died from pulmonary edema post circumflex STEMI and acute severe MR. The MR was poorly evaluated on the initial echo and under-diagnosed based off the poor quality available information. That patient remained hemodynamically unstable for 4 days until a repeat echo was ordered that I preformed, which showed severe MR. The patient was transferred for emergent MVR surgery that day and survived.

&amp;#x200B;

25% of the cases I found significant concerns, however the studies were overall diagnostic. 34% of the studies I had no significant concerns with. I presented this data to the cardiologists and they were not too surprised. They all agreed that the echoes preformed were overall very poorly done. Now, one would think that if a cardiologist orders the quality of something to improve, it would improve. However, this issue segways into my other problems which stem from lack of professionalism in the workplace.

&amp;#x200B;

The echo techs, save for one, are very arrogant and rather incompetent. If you have seen the movie Mean Girls, these folks are basically like that. They frequently critique the cardiologists for minor mishaps, and will not hesitate to write a formal compliant if they feel a cardiologist did something wrong. They do not take constructive criticism or feedback well. They often call the cardiologists idiots, stupid, wrong and other, more unprofessional expletives. I think these cardiologists are fantastic.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a culture of rampant sexual harassment, inappropriate sexual touching, inappropriate sexual conversations, jokes, innuendos and stunts. In addition, these people enjoy also making fun of patients for odor, weight, disease status and physical appearance. They are also loud and obnoxious, and the patients in the exam rooms can hear this and will comment about it. On top of all that, they are lazy and disorganized and will look for excuses to not scan a patient, when there is no real reason to delay that patient's care. Basically, it is like my high school experience, but at work. I read the employee code of conduct and these folks have committed multiple violations and I am documenting it.

&amp;#x200B;

What compounds this problem is similarly incompetent and arrogant management. The echo lab supervisor protects these echo techs and has on multiple occasions stopped changes ordered from the cardiologists to improve the echo quality. The manager above the echo lab supervisor does the same. Some of the cardiologists no longer want to sign their name on the echoes for fear of malpractice. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a meeting planned to address these technical concerns of the echoes where the cardiologists and myself will explain the technical failures of the lab and each individual tech. When that happens, I will be put into a position where I will fear workplace retaliation, slander/libel/defamation and possible physical harm, however unlikely, though I wouldn't put it past one person, who is one of the worst offenders. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess, after this super long post, what should I do to protect myself? The cardiologists are going to use my data to force much needed reform at this place. I know I can go to HR , get protection from retaliation and report the unprofessional workplace environment and sexual harassment, but in my experiences with HR, those are last people I want to go to. The bottom line is that patients harm is occurring. I have never seen such a terrible place and honestly am at a loss to what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to add, he is the husband of the DM of the store I was floating at, but both the pharmacist &amp; I said he should know the rules.

Anyways I’m curious as to if ANY state allows the sale of Sudafed through the drive through... I also am nervous after the actions he committed tonight, he knows my car as it has a sticker on the back with my name on it. God forbid if he were to see my car anywhere, who knows what would happen. I work at a store near my uni &amp; my pharmacist there said I can float during breaks at the store where my home is, since I did begin there &amp; they transferred me to be closer to school. I’m just really nervous about what he could do to me if he were to see me in public, or even on the road again. I’m a very small girl &amp; he is a man, much bigger than me, he could crush me with his pinky if I’m being honest. I’m also curious if anyone else has had a problem similar to this, thanks!

Edit: about that sticker, it is a very small sticker that has my name, just my first name, the other part of it just has the high school dance team I was on when I was in high school which is much bigger...

Date of Visit: 
@TD@

Referring Physician: 
@REFPROV@

Reason for Referral/ Chief Complaint: 
This is a 78yo female w/ PMH including HTN, CKD 2, multifocal OA, R.hip replacement (circ 2015) who follows up for further evaluation of subjective memory issues as reported to PCP. 

She reports that since ~11/2019, she has been having some subjective difficulty w/ short term memory. Specifically, she's noted issues w/ remembering people's names. Not the names of people she's close with, mind you - she can and will name all of her children, step-children, and (step-)grandchildren, whether you want her to or not. However, she recently moved into an ALF and she's organizing both the Christmas decorations for the entire facility, as well as the upcoming Christmas party (which I'm told is ""actually being referred to as a 'Holiday Party,' but there are pinecones w/ glitter *and* laughing Santas so you tell me""). This has required her to assemble multiple spreadsheets and a big bulletin board for group assignments. Within the context of this Yuletide Blitzkrieg, she's found it hard to immediately recall the Christian names of the other 160 occupants of her ALF (that she's lived in for &lt;6 months). Of note, she's quick to reassure me that she does remember their names a few minutes later, as well as whether or not they have a dog. She sees my expression and goes on to explain - with more pity than I’d prefer - that ""doggies also need a Christmas,"" and have been accounted for in her spreadsheet. 

Of note, she likes to keep up w/ current events and subscribes to a few journals. She's a retired college professor w/ a PhD in mathematics. 

Past family &amp; social history:
The following portions of the patient's history were reviewed and updated as appropriate: allergies, current medications, past family history, past medical history, past social history, past surgical history and problem list.

PMHx/PSHx:

HTN, CKD 2, multifocal OA 

R.hip ORIF, 7/2015

Allergies:

Not having desk items organized, color coded, and at 90 degree angles to one another, I'm guessing.

Current medications

Assessment/Plan:
This is a 78yo female w/ PMH including HTN, CKD 2, multifocal OA, R.hip replacement (circ 2015) who follows up for further evaluation of subjective memory issues as reported to PCP.

- Given the history above, one has to assume that she mentioned ""memory stuff"" to her PCP, prompting an was exhausted grunt and a few mouse clicks but no further history taking. The amount of projects and variables she is juggling - *by choice*, mind you - is staggering. She remembers literally goddamn everything.

- She's barely able to restrain herself from writing equations on nearby glass surfaces. I saw her eyeing the back of my head - which is balding - and in a moment of fleeting prescience, I positively *knew* she wanted to point out how it conformed to the Golden Ratio. Her impulse control and sheer good breeding argue strongly against any sort of frontal process.

- Given how high-functioning she appears to be, it's frankly difficult to tell if she has any actual cognitive impairment. If Tesla showed up to my office and reported that he was forgetting to carry the 1 more than usual, I'd have no choice to believe him - but who the fuck could actually tell?

- Defer MRI

- No meds at this point. Frankly, if she is developing dementia, it'll just drag her down to my level. Good.

- Defer discussing sweater; this is likely a seasonal issue. Consider addressing this if she wears it again at next visit.

We went flying across the hospital, across a bridge. For some reason the elevator wouldn’t open at the right floor. This should have been my first tip-off.

I’ve been a CNA at an oncology hospital for over a year now. I’ve been with my current partner for about as long. I hand out a good number of “I’m sorry to hear that”s and other cheap comforts most days at work. I distance myself pretty well from it to avoid emotional burnout, but the last 3 or so months I’ve been having issues being comforting for my partner. I find that I get irritated when they complain about something completely understandable like getting called into work, or seeking positive reinforcement, or basically anything where all I have to do is say “everything’s going to be okay”. I’ve never been the most emotionally in-tune person but I don’t think I’ve always had these issues. I’m not really sure what to do about it and I was hoping someone who’s experienced something similar could point me in the right direction.

medicine,Kids are resilient,"I'm a midlevel provider in a moderately rural part of Asia, I work in an overnight access clinic which is similar to the concept of a critical access emergency department, only we are only open overnight. We occasionally see some really ill people with nasty illnesses here, but every now &amp; then we see someone that you don't understand how they are alive or if they're not a zombie. This is one of those cases. 

A child is carried in by parents. Just on first glance - extremely jaundiced, sunken eyes, facial cyanosis, not really responsive, limp, gross abdominal distention. Aside from the obvious like jaundice &amp; cyanosis, he looked incredibly dehydrated &amp; ill. We took him straight back, got him on the monitor. He was quite hypotensive, tachycardic, hypoxic by SPO2, and tachypneac. SPO2 was being maintained in the low 90s with a non-rebreather at 14L. 

One of our students got all the PHX and HPI - No real medical history, family travelled out to the countryside to visit extended family. About 3 days after they got back he became ill - nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, increasing lethargy, breathing difficulties, etc. This was day 4 of illness. It was also stated the kid hadn't urinated since he started feeling ill (4 days).

We knew this kid needed to be in a big-city hospital and immediately started arranging that - but those transfers don't happen quickly. We assessed him and determined he had  splenomegaly which we confirmed by ultrasound and his bladder was huge + full. 

We got bilateral lines in the kid (he didn't react) and started giving ringers acetate (as opposed to ringers lactate due to liver issue, whatever is causing the jaundice). We placed a catheter, which he didn't react to either, and began a gradual decompression of the bladder. Urine was coloured a dark brown color with some red. This (and his spleen) pointed us to run a rapid test for malaria which was positive. He also had the characteristic ""ricewater"" diarrhea of cholera. We did a rapid test for cholera which was also positive. 

We started a combination antimalarial therapy, one of the drugs being doxycycline which is also effective for cholera. He continued to look worse visibly and decline up until our transfer arrived, and he coded during the process of handing-over care to the transfer team. We did get ROSC quite quickly, kid got hauled off lights &amp; sirens by the transfer team to the big hospital. 

That was something around a year ago, maybe a year &amp; a half. The other day one of the other providers ended up stitching the same kid up after a minor injury - I got a chance to see the kid got away remaining 100% normal from the illness last year, no neuro deficit from the code, no permanent issues.

Patent protection is supposed to be 20 years, and the FDA grants market exclusivity for 5 years for most new chemical entities, with possible 3 year extensions for new clinical investigation exclusivity.

Orange book has [3 patents listed for apixaban,](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/patent_info.cfm?Product_No=001&amp;Appl_No=202155&amp;Appl_type=N) with the earliest expiring 12/22/2019, and two others in 2026 and 2031.

And obviously if it was approved in 2012, it had to have been in R&amp;D for years before that (for example, clinical trials.gov has a phase 2 listed that started recruiting in 2004). 

I always thought ""on patent"" referred to the molecule itself. Obviously that is mistaken, so what are the different patents for? Why does Orange Book list a patent submission date that is after the date it was already FDA approved? How do I find out when the first actual ""20 year"" patent was submitted? I can assume it was 1999 if the first expired in 2019 (timing would makes sense comparing to the phase 2 study start date), but where is that actual date?",18,79,2019-12-26,PHARMA,0.024081535637378693,0.9317678213119507,0.04415060207247734
pharmacy,Any Walgreens hourly pharmacists out there know anything about them cutting the hourly rate of non salaried pharmacists?,"Have worked for Walgreens for 19 plus years as a retail pharmacist.  As you can imagine, I started when times were good and jobs were plentiful. Also as you can imagine, the job gradually wears you down and makes you hate it. Luckily over the past 5 to 10 years I've been able to gradually transition out of pharmacy into owning real estate rental properties and have been able to become an hourly PRN pharmacist where I can pick up shifts when and where I want which is very liberating. However, I heard from a couple fellow colleagues in the same position that they are going to cut the hourly rate for us part-timers down to what new grad rates are?  Has anybody else heard this as well and is there any truth to it? Also any input as to how they do it at other chains would be much appreciated.

medicine,Cystitis as a cause of encephalopathy? I just don't think so anymore,"This is going to be controversial.

I'm in ID, which means I went through IM first. During residency it was never a question when an elderly person came in with altered mental status, a positive UA, and a urine culture with *something.* We never looked up the data. We never cited a paper. It was just one of these core tenets of medicine. AMS was as good as dysuria as a symptom of UTI. It was obvious. Or so I thought.

Let me give context first: there are a couple of flavors of ID doc. Some love HIV, some are big into fungi, etc. I'm into sepsis. It's often claimed by ICU folks -which is totally appropriate- but I believe it should really be owned by ID. That's just me. 

Learning about sepsis means learning about the immune system. Indeed, the encephalopathy that happens in sepsis is mediated by a number of things, sometimes with that favorite neurology catch-all term ""toxic metabolic encephalopathy."" An old mind is more susceptible than a young one. In the absence of major hemodynamic upset (e.g. shock), the encephalopathy of sepsis is mediated by cytokines. It's been well studied in animal models, this thing called ""sickness behavior"" that causes them to hide away from others and act all sorts of unusual. Older brains, damaged brains, heavily medicated brains...maybe they don't respond to the cytokines in the same way. And why should they? Primitive humans didn't routinely live to ripe old age. As far a Mother Nature knew, your ""sickness behavior"" was crafted for a sick 20-something, not an 80-year old on several meds from the Beer's list.

All that is to say is this: if your demented old lady doesn't have any other systemic manifestations of an infection -or even an inflammatory response whatsoever- then i don't believe the bacteruria is at fault because I don't think her cytokines are even bumping to the level that her brain realizes that is going on. In my mind, that's like saying that Grandpa Joe cut his finger and now there's some pus there, and suddenly he's getting naked and screaming at the neighbors.

Let me go a step further. Demented old people are capable of feeling pain. You can assess them with GCS all day. There is no reason they can't feel cystitis or urethritis unless you've somehow blocked their ability to feel *anything* down there. **So if they don't have painful urination- if the inflammation from bacteria doesn't even register on the most local of levels- how on Earth is it going to cause a delirium?**

tl;dr When encephalopathy co-occurs with infection, it is a consequence of a susceptible brain exposed to a systemic inflammatory response. If the inflammatory response is local, there's not going to be an encephalopathy. Probably one of the 10 other interventions you simultaneously did on admission is what fixed them.

pharmacy,Chargebacks from bad to worse,"Here's the deal.  Patient fills medication that costs the pharmacy about $5.  Plan pays $48 with a copay of $3.  Pharmacy is pleased with an unusually high dispensing fee.  A statement comes at the end of the month from the insurer.  “Sorry, we overpayed”.  And they take back $42.  After all is done pharmacy makes $1.

If that were the worst of it, it would be fine.  It is a little suspect that the same insurer is overpaying the same amount every month and fixes their “mistake” later on, every month.  Low dispensing fees are not unusual, but unfortunately they frequently dip below the cost of the meds.  

Here's where it gets weird.

Patient fills med for a total compensation of $48.  But their copay is $47.  Later on, the plan fixes their mistake and takes back $42.  However, in this case, the plan really only paid $1.  They're taking money from the patient's copay.  So at the end of it all, the pharmacy received $6, and the insurer received $41, all of which was paid by the patient.  The patient is literally paying their insurer to fill the med, instead of the other way around.  And not a small amount.

Now let's say the patient has a secondary.  Primary pays $48, with a copay of $47.  Secondary looks at that amount and say no that's not right, they set the compensation to $7 and pay all of it.  Patient pays nothing.  Later, primary comes back, has no idea what the secondary did, and takes back $42.  Now the pharmacy has received $7 from the secondary, and paid $42 to the primary.  The pharmacy is paying to fill the patient's med, to the primary.

All of these numbers are real examples.  Several of the plans do it, but the worst starts with AE and ends in ME.  Pharmacies lose hundreds every month per patient.  For patients with high copays, you can do it for cash and come out ahead.  But if they have low or zero copays, you can't.  They are even underpaying for brands by a few percent which has no excuse.

There's no way any of this should be legal.  They're literally stealing money from patients and pharmacies.",12,54,2019-12-28,PHARMA,0.22795431315898895,0.7453255653381348,0.026720095425844193
pharmacy,Hard-of-Hearing Technician,"I need some advice from any pharmacists, techs, clerks, and so on. I'm a late deafened /HOH tech trainee in Texas and have been working in the field for about a year. 

I came into pharmacy after an illness destroyed my hearing. I often get dizzy from the vertigo and I called in once because I was so sick I couldn't leave the house.  I'm profoundly deaf in one ear (I can hear at 90 decibels or higher) and moderate loss (about 50% loss or so). I don't have hearing aids because I can't afford them. I do use a hearing amplifier in my profound ear so I can pick up a bit more sound but it doesn't help much. I can't always understand where sounds are coming from and often read lips to supplement what I can't understand. I do okay on the phone most of the time 

Otherwise, I work at a high volume store.  We have these ""senior techs"" who often cause drama at the store. They only ever fill, don't do DE, won't resolve third party issues, and etc. They never answer the phone because they are talking with each other and giggling. The PIC has hired new people but these older techs often talk crap  and say stuff like, ""It's in the book learn it!"" They are in their late 30s and it baffles me. I'm 24, by the way.

It drives people off (customers &amp; employee s). I have stayed because I need this job to get certified and want to use this as a career for a couple of years while I go back to school for medical laboratory scientist. I can't go back to making minimum wage ($7.25-$8.00).

The girls do talk about me and blamed me for filling a patient's atorvastin with rovustatin. I admit, with my hearing loss I can't pronounce the names of drugs correctly. However, the computer shows a brand new tech trainee and her senior tech trainer. I was working that day but I was helping our floating pharmacist with a flu shot clinic. I didn't fill any scripts that day. 

The guest complained (rightfully so) and when the PIC investigated, those two techs blamed me. I got written up, an incident report was done, and the PIC is just letting me cashier. I have a hard time cashiering because I can't hear that well. I talked to the PIC and told her so. The PIC said, ""We can't have you misunderstanding people and killing them."" He won't listen at all. My

 The problem is I didn't know about this until the write up. The other techs, I think took advantage of my hearing loss.


I don't know enough on my job to take the PTCB yet and pass. However, finding a new job will be hard and most jobs that will hire a deaf/HOH person around here pay minimum wage IF they will hire one.

pharmacy,Managing a technician with a bad attitude,"Hey y'all I need some advice on how to handle one of my techs. She's a smart girl and is fully certified but damn is she hard to deal with. Couple of examples are:

1. Her snacking: I've never seen someone snack so much in my life. We have snack shelves in the pharmacy and her shelf has over flowed to everyone else's. We even got complaints from the front store staff that she leaves snacks in the break room. Normally who cares but it gets to the point where it distracts her from her job because she'll go out on the floor to buy snacks when there's costumers waiting in line. I've talked to her multiple times about this and she claims they ""weren't there when she left"". Even if that we're technically true, she's gone for long enough that people end up being in line while she's gone.

2. She refuses to talk to difficult patients. Every pharmacy has those handful of annoying patients. When she sees their caller ID she'll say ""oh it's so and so I'm not talking to them!"" But if myself or the other tech is busy we can't drop what we're doing and help them just cuz she doesn't feel like it?? I've actually written her up for this. The problem is she does this when I'm not there. So I only here about it the next day or week when the other techs or pharmacist tell me about it.

3. She claims she's sick in order to not do certain tasks. For example she didn't want to do the courtesy calls because her ""throat hurt"" but yet she was talking   fine about the vacation she was going on tomorrow. She's said multiple times that she has really bad GERD and has to go home early. But refuses to take any medication to help it. 

The biggest problem is that she does all these things mostly when I'm not there. So it's difficult to discipline her when it's after the fact. I'm not sure what to do at this point besides writing her up constantly and eventually firing her.",54,110,2019-12-31,PHARMA,0.294188916683197,0.6780460476875305,0.02776508219540119
