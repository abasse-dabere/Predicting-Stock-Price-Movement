pharmacy,"APhA supporting homeopathy, how is this a thing?","I came across the exhibitor list for the 2017 Exposition, and I was shocked to see that APhA allows homeopathic companies to have booths at its yearly convention. How can APhA and all the pharmacists involved feel alright about supporting something so completely unscientific? To me this is a complete embarrassment to our profession, not to mention a very unethical thing to promote.

pharmacy,Am I being offered too low of a rate for a new RPh?,"Hi everyone, so i just graduated pharmacy school in new york state and a major retail chain has offered me a job about a week ago. Ive been with the company for a number of years and have had nothing but rave reviews as an intern. Ive not only helped turn my store from one of the bottom performing in the district into the top, but I routinely pick up shifts at other stuggling stores to help them out. The rate they have offered to me is 57 an hour. Although you could do worse, I know that floaters on my district make 60 an hour and i know of pharmacists that are new to the company with only a year or 2 of experience that were hired earlier this spring that make 64.  This combined with the fact that the hours per week im being offered comes out to litterally a few hundred dollars over 100,000 makes me feel like they are lowballing me. 56.50 would make it 98000 (sub 6 figures), I feel like thats too much of a coincidence and theyre hoping ill see its 6 figures and be overjoyed. What should i do? I like working for this company, but i dont feel that im being offered a competitive rate. I have to get my answer to them in the next day or 2.

pharmacy,Pharmacy School applications ARE going down - but when will this downward spiral stop?,"PharmCAS and ASHP data have shown that pharmacy school applications have been declining despite the increase in the number of pharmacy schools recently. NAPLEX passing rates are declining (thank god) and I hope they continue to make it more difficult so incompetent students cannot practice in the field. 


What is the REALISTIC opinion of current pharmacists on when this spiral will end? I feel like I either see two extremes: pharmacists will be obsolete in ten years OR people who are OMG we are so clinical and there is such a shortage!

I do tend to be optimistic and I think young students are *SLOWLY* catching on to the pharmacy saturation but I mean who the hell would apply to a doctoral degree, waste 6 years of their life and know they may not have a job or will be making only about 70k with 275k tuition?

Sorry for the long post but it really baffles me that schools are STILL opening. When you search online all you see everywhere is how salaries and job prospects are on a downward decline and I realllllly just want to start seeing schools closing down and NAPLEX becoming a truly difficult exam so that only quality PharmDs can enter the field and the market will normalize. When I applied to pharmacy school in 2012 I did so because I honestly do like pharmacy work and the market was not as abysmal as it is today. And of course I won't act like I do not care about money but the 120k salary at 24 years old was an important deciding factor as well (but not why I chose it completely). 

Opinions?? I mean there has to be a rock bottom point sometime soon......if I was a HS senior today and did research on pharmacy then HELL NO would I apply with the outrageous tuition rates and lowered salaries. 


EDIT: to add to this with focus on community pharmacy - it still does not make sense.

pharmacy,Advice on my situation,"Hi all, I wanted to get some advice on my situation. I enrolled in a good pharmacy school on the east coast in fall 2010 with a pre-pharmacy curriculum (no b.s. degree at that point). My first year went well and I made good grades in all my classes. Between the first and second year I had something weird happen to my vision. It wasn't blurry but was uncomfortable and made studying a chore. I tried to figure it out with eye doctors but no one figured it out for a while. In the meantime, I stupidly forced myself through my second and third years at pharmacy school doing well in non intense classes, but my grades for all my therapeutics courses ranged from high to low C (even though I studied my tail off for those classes). I was in my final year with APPE rotations, and after two of nine I just couldn't take it anymore. The rotations really made it difficult to mask my vision problems. So I spoke with the school and went on medical leave trying to solve my vision problems. I spend three years getting care from a ton of really good opthalmologists at the local hospital. I attempted a return to school in spring of 2015, but got very sick and my vision got even worse from then on. Since then my vision gets clear and blurry fluctuating several times a minute. However, the main issue is there is so much pressure built up around my eyes that reading for long periods is very hard and uncomfortable. So I've been on medical leave again since then. Last year I had a MRI and was diagnosed with MS. The doctors since have said that their best guess is it's related to that. So it seems my vision will stay like this permanently. So all this to say that I had a couple questions. First, has anyone else in pharmacy practice or school dealt with visual impairment and if so what techniques did you use that helped? Secondly, does anyone know of any careers in the pharmaceutical field that may be more suited for someone with vision difficulty? I can read clearly but it's slow and uncomfortable. There is assistive technology such as text to speech that helps, but I'm looking for jobs that these technologies are suitable for. Finally, would these jobs require a Pharm. D degree? At the end of py3 year, I received B.S. in pharmaceutical science and am wondering if I should try to return and finish my pharm D degree. I met with the dean of the pharmacy school and she said that since I've completed all the classwork I may be able to get some jobs without the pharm D. degree. Just wondering if it's worth trying to return or not. Thanks!",9,10.0,2017-11-04,PHARMA,0.10635975003242493,0.854964554309845,0.038675643503665924

And instead of the 6 pills I was prescribed, I was given 90 pills.

medicine,Do doctors become desensitized to their patient's pain?,"I'm going to attend med school next year and what I always asked myself, since I aspire to become a doctor one day, is whether they grow somewhat emotionally numb to the suffering of their patients with time. Not too long ago I did an internship at a hospital at a cystic fibrosis station. Many severely ill people, most of them children, with very low life expectancy and one of the patients, a guy my age, was even dying because his organs were failing. Now as I'm thinking about it I'm getting teary-eyed because I'm in an emotional state as it is, but at that time it didn't faze me that much. I knew it was bad but I couldn't quite emotionally grasp it, so their pain didn't effect me as much as I expected it to. So what I'm wondering is, is it always like that for experienced doctors? Do they become desensitized to death and suffering, so it doesn't bother them as much as the average person?",14,20.0,2017-11-08,PHARMA,0.15149140357971191,0.8251364827156067,0.02337208203971386

pharmacy,Private consulting?,"Well, odd question. I'm a pharmacist. Got a weird phone call from an attorney the other day, wanted me to review a clients medications. He sent me a bunch of information regarding his client, including a document in which he is legitimately pt's durable POA. 
Basically client is an old patient with worsening dementia. The guy sent me records of patients stay in a home, nursing reports indicating worsening confusion eventually resulting in an incident where patient became combative and disruptive. Yes they kind of messed around with her meds prior to this happening. Home wants to move her to a lockdown secured facility now.
Attorney said he wanted my opinion on patients medications, any interactions/side effects of current medications and any suggestions to therapy. There are some improvements to patients regimen that would be appropriate. 
Attorney said to bill him whatever for these services. I've been working from home on this, (not like I could just piss off and review her charts during working hours at the pharmacy) is there any legal or ethical problems with doing so? I'm considering creating an invoice for just two hours of my normal hourly pay. I've read one would not need to report side incomes of less than $600 for tax purposes. 
When the attorney first called, I asked ""would I need to be on record for any of this?"" The guy said he's not considering taking any legal action or anything like that. I don't think the guy is going after anyone, just wants to lookout for the patient. Apparently has known patient for 20+ years, it feels a bit personal. Patient doesn't have any children or family that was listed in reports I read. The attorney said he would then speak to the patients care team, but does not believe it would be necessary to share my opinions. 

So yeah. Question basically is: Has anyone ever done private consulting like this? Any ethical or legal problems? Obviously this all backfires if I get a subpoena in the mail; but I really don't get the vibe from this guy that he wants to go after anyone. 
I keep going back and forth on this. I probably should have just said ""go speak with your care team"", but someone asking you to review their medication list and give your opinion isn't exactly uncommon or unethical. Any problems with collecting if doing so outside of work?

pharmacy,Anyone getting complaints from patients about Osmotica (Trigen) generic for Concerta?,"So, at the end of July, Osmotica got FDA approval for a new generic for Concerta, marketed by Trigen. At my chain this brand has been our preferred NDC for a couple months now. Our old preferred was the authorized generic (identical to brand name), marketed by Actavis.

---

One patient had her doctor send in a new prescription a couple weeks early because this new brand was ineffective for her. She was very upset that it wasn't working and we eventually filled the new prescription for the Actavis brand.

Another patient's mother relayed that her 10-year old son noticed that his medication wasn't working nearly as well once he switched to the Trigen generic. A switch back to the Actavis brand next month fixed the issue.

Yet another patient's mother relayed that her 14 year old daughter's medication stopped working for her, and noticed that the tablets were different than the ones she received the month prior. Sure enough, it was the new Trigen generic, and she had been getting Actavis before. Switching back to the Actavis brand had everything back to normal.

---

For the majority of medications, including other ADHD medications, a difference in manufacturer month to month very rarely leads to complaints from my patients, so this strikes me as odd. I'm starting to wonder if this new generic is going to meet the same fate as the Kremers/Mallinckrodt generics, [which were found not to be bioequivalent to the brand name](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm422569.htm) and thus attained a BX rating (data are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence). Last year the FDA [proposed withdrawing approval for these generics](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm422568.htm) since the companies did not submit the relevant data showing bioequivalence.

A [study from last year](http://www.neurology.org/content/86/16_Supplement/P6.3310) with 14 patients seems to support this idea too, though this was before the Trigen generic came out.

From what I can tell their extended-release mechanisms are not identical to Concerta's fancy OROS system, which is apparently hard to replicate without being too similar to the brand name. I found [this blog post](http://www.keyministry.org/church4everychild/2017/10/26/why-your-kids-concerta-isnt-working-as-it-should-chapter-two) from some physician who's had patients complain about the new generic. It also states that the extended-release mechanism is more similar to the OROS system in the original Concerta, but I'm not really sure how to go about validating that. I may have found [the patent](https://www.google.com/patents/US8685451) for Osmotica's OROS tablet but I'm not sure if this is identical to the one they used for their generic Concerta.

So at least it seems like I'm not the only one who's been noticing this. Anyone else been running into this problem?",12,10.0,2017-11-10,PHARMA,0.19999124109745026,0.7760136127471924,0.023995069786906242

medicine,How to approach a patient that starts a crying breakdown?,"Hello r/Medicine!

I am a medstudent that just started having contact with patiens this year. One problem that I have is when my patient starts to cry for some unrelated reason (sometimes). It is usually because of personal problems and things I have very little control over and also I don't have the knowledge about the best way to approach the situation, and so I just stay there listening to their story and say generic things such as “this must be terrible for you” and other generic stuff.

What prompted me to ask this question is one patient I had this week. She was a babysitter for a family of millionaires so she was very well payed and had opportunities to travel all around the world. However, when her daughter’s soon to be husband cheated on her daughter and married another women she had to quit her amazing job to help take care of her daughter’s son. 

In the end she is now without a health care plan and appear at my uni clinic for a dermatology consult because she was very anxious(could not sleep and stuff) about a lesion she had on her scalp but it turned out it was nothing serious.

What I did to her was just listen to her story and nod while se was crying and everything. At the end of the consult she was already recomposed and better, we finished the consult and said goodbye to her. 

I’m just here to ask about some personal opinions about how to deal with this based on your experience.

medicine,Thanking a physician,"So this post technically violates the rules but I figured, it was a reasonable one. 

I wrote my physician a thank you letter. I went to a sleep doctor when I was 17 because I was falling asleep standing in the shower every morning. I was tested with an overnight study and was told it was relatively normal. There was no follow up or treatment. 13 years later, I was at the end of my rope. I was sent to another sleep physician. He had terrible online reviews. He listened to my history and said, he thought he knew the problem after spending an hour with me going over my history. He didn't say what but he did another overnight study and a multiple sleep latency test. My follow-up was the following week. 

Again he sat down with me for about an hour to explain I had narcolepsy without cataplexy and how the original test when I was 17 wasn't sufficient. My quality of life has improved so much, words cannot express my gratitude to this physician. I later learned, he was the first physician in my area to have a sleep lab that was able to properly diagnose all known sleep disorders. He frequently gives talks on raising awareness of rare sleep disorders. 

He's considered the best in the area by physicians, but still has poor patient reviews. There's no way this guy makes a dime treating me because he spends too much time with me at each follow up. I also learned he turned down over a quarter million dollars from a pharmaceutical company. He profoundly changed my life. It's been over five years I've been a patient.

The day after sending my letter to him, I received a call from him thanking me for the letter. He said with all the frustration dealing with insurance, unreasonable patients, etc, he really appreciated the letter. It made medicine worthwhile. I could tell it meant more to him than any amount of money I could ever give him. 

I figured, I'd share my story. I'm an attorney and I understand how awful the service industry can be. Thank you to all the physicians that go the extra mile. Thank you for putting up with the daily frustrations and still doing your best. Some of us really do appreciate your work. 

Edit: I will add that he's been practicing a long time. If you're a sleep medicine specialist in the US that treats narcolepsy, you've probably heard of him or read one of his publications. He doesn't seem to be retiring anytime soon but I noticed he's never been awarded any achievement award I could find so I was looking for some way to at least nominate him for his work. I don't know anything about that process so if anyone has any recommendations, please let me know.",56,707.0,2017-11-16,PHARMA,0.03429762274026871,0.9217504262924194,0.043951988220214844
pharmacy,Emailed John Oliver!,"AN EDIT: Since some people are taking getting riled up.... This is based on my experiences and perspective after being in the field for 10+ years and working at various different pharmacies all over NYC. I will leave what I wrote intact and sincerely apologize for the overly generalized statements I make. Basically, I just wanted to point out that RETAIL pharmacy has lots of problems stemming from the big companies doing business while asserting their money and power and ultimately the pharmacists have to pay for it due to a lack of real/influential representation. I'm just looking for a solution to our problems and hoping you guys can input ideas. Thanks for the read guys.


The following is an email I sent to John Oliver hoping to get some coverage....please tell me if I'm wrong on any points or if you'd like to add anything to it! Edit here: With anything I learn and gather from this post, I'll send John Oliver another email rectifying any mistakes I've made. Including the fact that I made overly generalized statements.


***I'm a pharmacist that graduated in 2009 but have worked in a pharmacy since I was about 21 years old. I worked in a chain for a long while and now am working in an independent pharmacy. I wish to stay under the radar as much as I can if possible but things are getting bad and unfortunately pharmacists don't hold much power in America. Between doctors, pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies, and chain pharmacies, small pharmacies and pharmacists are constantly abused. 


Mr. Oliver's program reaches a lot of people and is covered on a lot of news media so I was hoping maybe he could do a piece about this and it'll help us in the long run.


From a pharmacists perspective, the job is a huge lie. When we went into pharmacy school, we were promised a job with many perks, bonuses, satisfaction, and respect. No pharmacist I know got those.

Working for Walgreens, I worked 8 hour shifts, on my feet, not allowed to sit. We don't have a set lunch time and lunch is usually whatever you can shove down when you have a moments breath. So I usually had to snack on unhealthy stuff which is ironic considering I'm filling prescriptions that were probably caused by those types of snacks. I'm now in my 30s and have feet problem. I know plenty of pharmacists who had to get surgery due to their feet or take anti anxiety/depressant medications due to the job. 


There are of course lots of issues dealing with customers/patients. They want their medications ""right now!"", and its always the pharmacists fault if they can't get it, even if its the insurance not paying or the doctor making a mistake. We get questions like, ""the doctor wrote it so he wants me to have it! Why aren't you giving it to me??"" But our job is to make sure it goes through the insurance and the medication is correct and not going to harm the patient. But they don't understand, and while that sucks, thats fine and we deal with it.


But the big companies are the problem. They want 15 minute wait times but don't provide the help required to meet that time frame. I would say within an 8 hour period about 100 prescriptions a pharmacist can handle alone if its all spread out decently. But after 100 a tech is required and I'd say every 50-100 extra would require an extra person. Meaning if a pharmacy is doing 300 a pharmacist, and 2 techs are bare minimum. But due to there being a tight budget, I usually had to do more than 300 with one tech. Which in turn makes the waits an hour and then the complaints understandably come in. The people above ask why, and in turn we usually respond we need more people. Their response is usually that they don't have the money to hire another person. Which is a bunch of garbage. 


That is why we don't get to eat normally or sit for a moment. And while pharmacists start at a 6 figure salary, our growth is virtually nonexistent. I graduated 8 years ago and make about the same now. So while I started off higher than my friends, gradually they'll make more than I do. We're worked like dogs and paid decently initially but in all honesty, not sure if its even remotely worth it. We go to school for 6+ years and hold doctorates but are treated like those who work at a fast food restaurant. Actually worse since they get break time. 


There are plenty more complaints but we'll move on for now.


The second part are these insurance companies. 


CVS Caremark is eating up all the insurance companies and there is almost a monopoly situation happening. CVS Caremark and Express are about 80-90% of the insurances used by most people. CVS Caremark is trying to buy out Aetna as well.


They do not reimburse properly. Let's say a medication costs about 10 dollars for the pharmacy to buy. Healthfirst (which is under CVS Caremark), pays 11 dollars, if that. In NYC, electronic prescriptions are mandatory. And they charge about 60 cents to receive one prescription. Between that, labels, vials, bags, etc we are negative. In some case where the medication very cheap, they pay nothing and expect the patient to pay a copay. Then there are cases with negative reimbursement. 


Examples: New generic medication comes out. Insurances pay generic prices but won't let us bill for the generic. They claim its not part of the formulary and require the brand be billed.


Prices of medication fluctuates, usually going up. But the insurances don't pay for the adjusted prices and pay the old prices.


And funny part is these usually take months (3+) to fix. On the flipside, sometimes the drug prices goes down but takes a little while for the distributors to get those prices. On day one of the price drop, the insurances readjust their pricing and pay less, even if we purchase for a higher price.


Furthermore, CVS caremark sometimes require patients to use CVS pharmacies only or to use their mail order system. That is steering patients and I'm pretty sure illegal. But since they're so big, doesn't matter. 


So in order to stay afloat, survive...what do small pharmacies do? They cheat. 


https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/brooklyn-pharmacy-owneroperator-charged-defrauding-medicare-and-medicaid-programs


http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-pharmacist-scammed-millions-state-medicaid-ag-charges-article-1.3441784


Stories like this come up. And of course they are stupid and went to the extreme, but in all honesty stuff like that happens in almost all pharmacies because theres absolutely no other way to survive. 


Pharmacies are supposed to charge copays, but majority don't to keep competitive. Theres so many choices of pharmacies that if a customer doesn't like how they're treated in one place, they'll go to another and then to another if necessary. 


Then there are pharmacies who pay patients (usually HIV patients) to come to their patients. From what I've heard, some pharmacies also buy the medication back from the patients as well.


I'm not condoning any of these actions. I think its all wrong and illegal yes. But it is impossible to compete with the chains. And the insurances are allowed to do whatever they want and there are no ways for a small pharmacy to fight back. People who cheat should be punished, including the big companies, not just the small guys. They wonder why the cost of healthcare in America is a problem. And while it may not be everything, its things like this that contribute to the issue. 


Sorry for going on so long and honestly theres a lot more I wish to say but these are the basics.


I really hope this problem can be addressed, but unfortunately, like I said before, pharmacists don't hold any power anywhere.


Thank you for the read ***

She was asking about cyclosporine and I made an off the cuff remark that she shouldn't be too worried because she shouldn't be prescribing it anyway (after educating her about the labs to follow, doses etc.). When she leaves she says to me ""you know NPs can prescribe right?"" and I responded I know but the majority of attending dermatologists don't even feel comfortable prescribing cyclosporine (we are in Derm). She got very defensive about how the NPs she shadowed during clinicals prescribed biologics and other ""dangerous drugs"". She is in literally her first week of shadowing, couldn't name the FDA approved indications nor the side effects of the medication but was so confident about her ability to prescribe it. It's just frustrating that new NPs think they know more than residents because they legally can practice independently and make 3 times our salary.

I get that maybe I should have educated her more about the reasons she shouldn't be prescribing cyclosporine (no FDA approved indications in Derm, very real possibility of irreversible kidney damage, increased cancer risk, dosing issues, FDA labeling states it should only be prescribed by physicians experienced with prescribing immunosuppressant medications etc.) but it was just a frustrating experience dealing with someone who will be practicing independently after a few months of shadowing.

medicine,First briefing regarding the defected KPA soldier - media release detailing trauma care,"Here's an unusually detailed media release regarding the sequence of events after admission of a defected North Korean soldier who sustained multiple gunshot injuries in his escapade across the 38th parallel. 

Original post from r/korea - report translated from Korean by user yh5203 (https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/7dacfr/ajou_hospital_released_the_detailed_state_of/)

[First briefing regarding the defected KPA soldier] November 15th

Ajou University Hospital Trauma Surgery Dept. received call from the Dustoff(CASEVAC) team regarding evacuation of the patient. At 16:53 Local on Nov 13th 2017, the helicopter carrying the wounded KPA soldier landed on the Ajou hospital's helipad. The patient was moved to the trauma center's trauma resuscitation room.
The patient had arrived with dressing on gunshot wound on right buttock, left armpit, back shoulder, right upper arm, and right knee. Also, the patient had received good first aid from the members of the dustoff team who feared pressured pneumothorax and performed needle thoracostomy on the left thorax during the transfer.
Initially regarding the vital signs, the systolic blood pressure dropped to 70 and the consciousness was in drowsy status. To secure the airway sedatives were administered and we intubated the airway. Then we rapidly transfused. As resuscitation was going on, during the ultrasound check up, large amount of hemorrhaging was observed. This was diagnosed as the cause for the shock so without a CT scan or other additional close examination, the patient was moved to the operation room for an emergency operation at 17:23 (30 minutes after arrival).

[1st Surgery] To approach the multiple gunshot wounds in abdomen and limbs simultaneously, we operated in two teams: trauma surgeons and orthopedics. First, the bleeding on the left armpit wound was severe so vascular ligation and hemostasis were performed. Simultaneously abdominal operation was performed. Severe bleeding, severely contaminated with feces and food (corn, etc), were observed in the abdominal cavity. The damaged area included a total of 7 ruptures in the small intestines and more than 6 ruptures and losses in the mesentery; and the damage in the pelvic cavity that pierced up, breaking the pelvis were the main areas of hemorrhaging. Also discovered were damages in the S-colon and a piercing wound continuing from the right buttock to the space inside pelvic cavity next to rectum.
In the ruptured small intestine, along with a large amount feces, many full-grown parasites were found and they were all removed. The biggest one was as big as 27cm. The hemorrhaging of the damaged mesentery was all mended. The ruptured small intestines were mostly sutured but small intestine segments with severe damage and contamination were resected and anastomosed. We performed a temporary abdominal wall repair for secondary evaluation of anastomotic site and damaged small intestine. Then because of the possibility of additional bleeding, we have ended the operation, leaving the last bullet in the abdominal wall for the 2nd surgery. A chest tube insertion was performed while there was a left-side hemopneumothorax caused by a bullet penetrating the upper left chest wall.
After the operation, CT and other additional examinations that weren't performed under the emergency situation were performed. Then the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for about 33 hours to perform critical care for hypothermia correction, coagulation factor correction to prevent further bleeding, and treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). On the morning of November 15, 2017, the patient was in a condition that allowed him to undergo final surgery so he was moved at 9:40 to the operation room.

[2nd Surgery] Secondary surgical findings showed edema and slight contamination of the small intestine and organs inside the abdominal cavity but there were no additional bleeding sites. No leakage was observed at the anastomosis and repair site during the first operation. The gallbladder with acute cholecystitis was excised, a prophylactic appendectomy was performed considering the age of the young patient. The abdominal wall was sutured after massive abdominal flushing to remove contamination. Abdominal surgery was ended after removing the bullet that had remained on the abdominal wall. After the orthopedic team has performed additional necrotic tissue removal at the gunshot area of the limb, the patient was moved back to the ICU.

[Treatment Plan] The patient is being administered sedatives in the intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation is maintained using a life support device. After careful observation of the patient's vital signs and anastomotic status, we plan to consider ceasing sedation and mechanical ventilation depending on the patient's recovery status. However, many complications are anticipated and require a high degree of caution. The wounds of the limbs, buttocks and abdominal cavity are likely to require additional orthopedic and plastic surgery depending on the patient's recovery status. In addition, there is a possibility of nerve injury in the right upper arm and left armpit, pelvic girdle and lower abdominal gunshot wound but it is impossible to evaluate the neurological evaluation without the current patient consciousness. The possibility of subsequent paralysis and other sequelae can not be overlooked.

[Prognosis] Contamination by intraperitoneal feces and parasites was very severe, and the prognosis is likely to be worse than that of general trauma patients because of the long period of time spent in the state of shock due to massive bleeding. In addition, a parasite infestation can lead to fatal complications if the intestinal tract is ruptured. In particular, we are cautious because we can not rule out the possibility of an unknown infection due to poor patient status and poor nutrition. We want to use all possible tests to clarify this.",29,39.0,2017-11-17,PHARMA,0.17606258392333984,0.7939194142818451,0.030018029734492302

medicine,Why do people practice medicine like this?,"60 something year-old man is brought to the ER by his family with 3 hour history of worsening left arm weakness. He had a CVA after CEA at OSH 10 days ago. His stroke was not treated at that time. His imaging from that hospital stay were transferred from the OSH. As soon as he hits the ER, he gets a head CT, CTA head. Orders are also put in for an MRI head, before any of the aforementioned exams were even completed. No physician has evaluated him yet, but both CT exams are performed. I read both. Remote right frontal infarct reidentified, along with two sub-acute infarcts that were already known about. No other significant finding. About 23 minutes after he leaves the scanner -not exaggerating- three additional requests are made: 1. Non-con CT head, 2. CTA head, CTA chest. I call the NP who put orders in (still no physician has evaluated him). She says he ""crumped"", requiring intubation. Said she needed to rule out new stroke, bleed, etc, as well as PE. I asked her if she really thought that in the last 23 minutes since his last exam he had a new infarct, hemorrhaged, or threw a PE!! And if she could maybe decide which of the three it might more likely be. She can't say, but she's sure it's one or the other (WTF?). Anyway we do all three exams.  All negative except for the aforementioned  strokes, no significant interval change in 23 minutes (surprise!). 

This shit is the reason the medical system in the United States will crumble. The complete lack of clinical judgement, blatant disregard for costs, and unwillingness/inability to apply even a little common sense. Occam's razor goes a long way in solving most problems.  This one patient was imaged a total of 8 times in the emergency department tonight alone, and probably will get an MRI overnight. On top of god knows how much imaging related to his surgery and strokes at OSH. 

Can anyone tell me why people abuse radiology so much? I'm not crying - I don't mind reading the extra scans they're often basically normal or unchanged from the recent comparison which was also unjustified.

pharmacy,Why pharmacy as a profession is advocating for provider status,"Hey fellow pharmacy peeps,

I just needed to get a rant out. I've been a part of this subreddit for about 5 years now, and although I love the community, we tend to be a pessimistic (or realistic?) bunch.

We tell people not to go into pharmacy, that the golden age is far behind us, that we're wasting our time with MTM or prescriptive authority or provider status. All of this compounded with less working man and woman hours, higher expectations, and low reimbursements makes me question why most of us got into the profession or stay with it.

I want to offer my perspective as a young pharmacist, manager, and co-owner of a small pharmacy. It's really REALLY hard not to be down these days about the current status of our profession. Reading what that other redditor's open letter to John Oliver was just the cherry on top of a year of hard work, depression, and exhaustion with little to show for it. Although what he wrote may be slightly exaggerated, most of it is true - pharmacy people are not treated as respected health care workers, and it's starting to show full force.

Our profession has grown into a numbers-based economy. PBM's have been cutting reimbursements from the front end (MAC reimbursement), back-end (DIR fees), and everywhere in between (frequent audits and clawbacks). Generic price decreases have dipped reimbursements on common drug items down to net losses after labor and materials. High brand prices creep up 1-2% every quarter which makes it difficult to meet contracted generic purchasing percentages. All of this snowballs into razor thin margins and emphasis on filling as many prescriptions as possible, sometimes without full regard for patient safety.

We need to practice what we preach. We know that our involvement can have significant impact on medication effectiveness and reduce harm. We know that we can have a positive impact in medical dollars spent. We know that we are trained to do so much more than stay in the pharmacy glued to our computer screens. In order to do this, we need to break free from the reimbursement model that chains us to being rewarded for nothing more than dispensing.

Look, I'm not saying we need to encroach on other professions, but we need to break down our silos. Being able to help bill for diagnoses in a prescriber's office will pay for a pharmacist salary with only 100 patients seen, and will help your prescribers avoid hefty MIPPS penalties. Being able to bill diagnoses codes in the pharmacy will reduce the need to fill an additional 50 scripts per day. Getting out of the pharmacy, making a OTC cold recommendation and actually getting paid more for it than the gross profit reimbursement of dispensing a cough syrup makes us money and saves the patient a doctor's visit.

Some of you think ""oh that'll be next on the corporate quota goal."" Maybe so. But don't you think your time is more valuable doing that than risking your license burning out checking 1000 prescriptions per day (literally)?

Others may think unionizing may save us. I'm 100% for protecting workers' rights, but I can tell you that corporations and pharmacies are abusing us for two reasons: 1.) lack of union pressure, and 2.) market incentives. Profit in the pharmacy isn't there like it used to be. Unless we increase revenue with negligible expense, we are only going to be abused even more. 

If not for changing our reimbursement model, we need to fight for dispensing fees. 50 cents per script isn't cutting it. Fighting for a reasonable rate of return through insurance companies needs to be a priority, but with pressures on keeping health care spending down, I don't believe this is a battle we will win. Transparency with PBM pricing should also be a priority, and will be easier to advocate politically, but once political pressure is off PBM's, expect things to go back to the way they were.

Bottom line: pharmacy is a valuable profession, but we need to escape from our vicious cycle of declining reimbursement for only dispensing, otherwise we are toast.",32,49.0,2017-11-19,PHARMA,0.07480331510305405,0.8935601711273193,0.031636472791433334

medicine,"Fellow Neurologists, how do you deal with the uncertainty of the neurological examination?","Neurological examination is neurologists best friend and our main diagnostic tool. It is actually one of the main reasons I got into the field - the idea of having such means to investigate and diagnose without having to rely so much on other tests was fascinating. However, I feel like I'll never shake off the doubts about the examination findings, specifically, whether what I am seeing is normal or abnormal. The spectrum of abnormality in a particular test can range from incredibly subtle to very obvious. The former is what's troubling. It could be pretty clear what ataxia is and how you should test for it, but the verbal description only goes so far, it seems you just have to *see* the full spectrum of changes. Then again, different neurological schools might interpret the same findings differently, almost as if you had to ""pick the eyes you want to see with"".

So, what helps you to draw the line between an incredibly subtle abnormal finding and hyperdiagnosis?

medicine,Unqualified NP in the practice I work in,"Hello all -
I'd like to preface by saying that this post is in no way purposed to make any blanket statement about nurse practitioners. Blanket generalizations are inaccurate and non-scientific. Disclaimer behind us:
I am an MD, but I am taking an interim year during my IM residency to do some low-stress work in a general family health clinic so that I have more time to attend to my parents' extreme health issues at home. I will return to residency in the hospital in June. 

I have accompanied an FNP into patient examinations on several occassions in a casual capacity to assist with dx/tx and to follow up with QI. Unfortunately, this NP appears to be borderline incompetent.

A patient on long-term anticoagulant/Warfarin therapy asked if she could take a prescription-strength NSAID to address her back pain. She said ""my cardiologist said I shouldn't because of some reason, but I don't know, can I?""
The NP then said ""Yeah, sure no problem. I don't see any reason why you couldn't/why there would be an interaction."" 

I had to step in to tell the patient that she should, in fact, not take Naproxen, as all NSAIDs are inherently blood thinners themselves. This, compounded with her being maxed out on Warfarin, would have undesirable effects and is strictly contraindicated unless a veteran cardiologist has made an elaborate risk-benefit analysis indicating otherwise. Afterwards, when I was relaying the mechanism of NSAIDs as inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and the subsequent effect on the coagulation pathway, the NP acted completely as though this were novel to her. 
This is one of many instances. On another instance, she called Wellbutrin an SSRI and tried to have a patient switch directly from a high dose SSRI that she had been on for 9 years to Wellbutrin with no taper schedule, saying that because they had the same mechanism, it should be a clean transition. 

She had not heard of ""broken heart syndrome, i.e Takotsubo's Cardiomyopathy,"" despite the fact that she had been a critical care RN for a decade. 
She very often confuses drug classes (Buspar as a benzo, Restoril as not a benzo, didn't know what an ARB was, did not know what the word ""GABAergic"" meant, and so on.) And these people can Rx narcotics in places like New York City, where this NP is from.

In general, she recommends little more than crock diets, exercise and physical therapy for nearly every ailment and seems to just have a very limited working knowledge of medicine. Almost every day there are at least a dozen instances where I find myself wondering how they do not teach this in the nurse practitioner curriculum? 
While I am a giant proponent of NP's, PA's and other axillary medical staff helping to buffer the overwhelming patient demographic that doesn't require the decades of medical education of a trained physician, such as in urgent care centers and family healthcare centers, this experience has definitely muddied my pro-autonomy position.
Does anyone have any input here, how I should maybe approach my view of this situation differently, or am I right on target and this person should be reported to the clinical supervisor? Has anyone else had similar experiences? Thanks, and again, complete respect to the intelligent and hard-learned clinical practitioners of all levels out there.",189,193.0,2017-11-22,PHARMA,0.08500504493713379,0.8879188299179077,0.027076127007603645

pharmacy,Stories of Rx's That Made You Cringe,"I may have only been a tech for five years at this point, but I've seen some absolutely cringeworthy orders written by doctors.

Favorite so far: Inpatient, order was written for sumatriptan 25mg po q2h scheduled. I had to call and ask the nurse what was meant by that and explain to her that there was no way in hell that was accurate, but she swore up and down the patient took it that way at home. I told her the patient would have hit the 900mg monthly limit within 3 days of doing that, but she didn't want to hear it. We refused to dispense it under those orders... And, surprise, turns out the patient took it prn migraine, to be repeated within 2 hours if symptoms persisted, like the usual.

Second: Also inpatient, patient was ordered an ungodly amount of insulin. I've seen some stuff, but 121U of levemir BID on top of novolog achs was more than a little alarming. This is more of a miscommunication on the order, but the nurse meant 12IU, which I really hardly ever saw insulin measured in ""international units"" instead of just ""units."" The med tech made a joke about taking a ""really long nap"" if we actually gave the amount we interpreted.

Third: outpatient, I've seen a lot of off-label uses for psych meds, but we were fairly certain that high doses of typical antipsychotics might be a bit too much to treat hiccups. Turns out the doctor put an extra digit on the end of the quantity.

medicine,Issue with nursing retaliation and a colleague,"Hey Medicine,

So I have a colleague in the ICU (fellow intensivist) who is new out of fellowship and is quite young for his profession (early college or something). He is, by all accounts, following all guidelines. He also moved to a conservative town in Alabama for his wife’s work and is a tatted up native Hawaiian. 


One middle aged nurse in particular is a cause of issues around the unit, and she has been called on about her issues at least once in the past. She was on vacation when my colleague started and when she came back immediately filed a report about my colleague because he called her bro and she found it unprofessional (he says these things in nearly every sentence when addressing people). Since then, she has seemingly taken interest in tarnishing his reputation. 



What happened next is quite a misfortune.  He had a patient who was intermediate risk for CAD with a trop leak. He was going off service the next day. He 2-PC’d the patient for a stress test (they were intubated) and the nurse in question happened to be taking care of the patient. She ran to the ICU director and told him that they thought my colleague was high and forgot intubated patients can’t get stress tests (when I questioned him he told me it was ordered because he was going off service and the patient would need it when they were inevatably extubated). I have been told by other nursing staff in private that this nurse chose to also encourage her friends to go to administration and at least one did with a phony story stating that my colleague was erratic on a consistent basis and made patients uncomfortable. It’s sad; most of the people liked my colleague. 


Administration called him in and told him that there were complaints about his erratic behavior from numerous nurses. As he just started, this was obviously jarring to all, and they threatened to restrict his privelages and submit him for random drug testing (he, by all accounts, has had no negative disciplinary issues ever). He was floored by this, alongside some racist comments, and walked out of the practice on the spot. He wasn’t too happy to begin with at the practice, and it admittedly is crumbling so this was the straw that broke the camels back. He’s currently working per diem coverage and his wife (thankfully) realized that they likely will be relocating. Happy ending, yay. 



My question is this-this nurse clearly had some issues, Be they racially motivated or just on a personal beef (with him being young she actually told him to page his resident and he informed her he was the attending, for example). I think someone who is viciously trying to impact the livelihood of others in the profession should answer for her actions.



I have considered talking to the ICU/nursing director, but other colleagues suggested calling the nursing board or even complaining to the hospital system (part of a large one). I’m erring on a larger scale, as her baseless accusations could have easily ruined a career.

But I'm interested in learning what others in medicine do and what lessons they've learned. [My post is here if anyone is interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/7g6zjq/my_lessons_on_productivity_as_a_surgical_resident/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link). **How do you stay focused, productive, and efficient in the world of medicine? How do you divide your time and avoid the dreaded act of ""wasting"" time?**
    
**Edit:** Apparently my link isn't working: Below is my post from r/productivity
  
I'm a huge fan of productivity and efficiency and as a father and general surgery resident my life is all about how I can squeeze as much as I can out of the very short 24 hours I have available each day. I feel like a lot of posts on this subreddit and others like it are more geared towards the professional students (aka college students) and those with non-traditional jobs like entrepreneurs and people who work from home. I figured I would share my own hard-learned lessons on how I stay productive and efficient in a pretty time-consuming job/field. I'm by no means an expert -- I'm just a guy who's had to figure out how to be organized, efficient, and productive in order to survive. I'm always on the look out for new tips, tricks and ways to improve my own system. I'll outline my personal system below and I would love any advice, comments, suggestions, etc from all of you. *I recognize that this will likely be a long post and may not be applicable to a lot of people, but hopefully I can break it up into enough salient points that you get something out of this. I'll be happy to answer comments and clarify as best as possible.*
  

First, here's a list of all of the apps and materials I use to stay productive. There are a TON of productivity apps, widgets, extensions, and materials out there. I feel like I've gone through so many that I've finally started to wittle it down to the ones that keep me most productive. I can also provide some pros and cons on some apps in the comments if anyone has any they'd like to discuss.
  

* **Wunderlist:** This is my data collection center. I brain-dump everything into here and organize as necessary. In the Getting things done (GTD) method, you're supposed to write everything down on paper then codify and file it away. I personally love paper and writing but I think doing it the exact way that David Allen does it isn't efficient for me. I want to be able to see everything at a glance anywhere that I am and be able to search through everything. Wunderlist does all these things and couples it with reminders and notifications. In my process of landing on Wunderlist, I used a paper-based method, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Evernote, and Office OneNote. **[My app is set up like this](https://imgur.com/a/DRxbG)**
* **Pocketbook:** Just a simple 3x5 moleskine pocketbook that goes everywhere with me. I use it in the times that I need to sketch something down faster than I can open my phone or if there's a diagram or something I want to draw out. I'm a visual learner so sometimes I have to sketch a picture or flowchart down to figure something out. Most things that go in here are either for scrap paper purposes or will get codified into Wunderlist
* **Bulletjournal:** I have a bigger, hardcover Moleskine journal that travels with me in my work bag. I tried the true bulletjournal method and unfortunately it didn't quite work for me for the same purposes the true GTD method didn't work for me: it's too time consuming for me to write things down and carry something that can't fit neatly in my pocket (or white coat pocket). I'm still trying to figure out a way to incorporate this fully into my system because I love the idea of keeping a journal and using fancy pens (shoutout to r/pens). The way I've been sparingly using it is for written notes for when I'm reading textbooks and journal articles, keeping track of interesting patient's and cases (without any patient identifying information, of course), and frankly for when I just want to write and use a fun pen.
* **Anki:** This is a flashcard app that's free to use as a computer program and carries a $25 price for mobile. I use this heavily and basically take all my notes there in flashcard format while reading. I'm a newcomer to this as well and learned about it on r/medicalschool and r/medicalschoolanki. I use this app as my ""time killer"" for when I'm standing in line for coffee or find myself to have a few minutes of free time in addition to dedicated study time.
* **Kindle app:** I've basically switched over to only electronic books at this point again for the same reasons as above: easy to carry, searchable, etc. It's a shame because I love me a good textbook, but the comfort of taking all of my massive medical textbooks with me anywhere and everywhere is priceless.
* **iCalendar:** Really any digital calendar app works; I used to use google calendar and loved that too. This is invaluable when used correctly 
* **Cloud storage:** I have and use dropbox, drive, and box for different reasons. Probably not as efficient as just keeping everything in one place but I divide it in a way that makes sense to me. It's arbitrary but just how I grew into them so I just use it that way. 
* **Notability app:** Used for reading and annotating PDFs like journal articles. 
* **Pomodoro app:** Take your pick, they all do the same thing. I don't always go by pomodoro because sometimes I just get into a good rhythm that can last an hour or more so I just kind of ride the wave until I feel like I need a break or feel myself losing concentration. Then I activate the app (or frankly just the timer app on my phone) so that I don't turn a brief study break into an hour long youtube rabbit hole dive. 
  

*Of note:* I don't use any chrome extensions that keep me productive or focused like the extension ""StayFocused"" because in my opinion you're either going to try to be productive or you're just going to use a bunch of stuff to try and force yourself to be productive when you don't want to and you'll just find ways around it. I just found myself going on my phone or facebook app or diverting my attention in other ways.

  
**My system:** I based my overall productivity system on the **Getting Things Done (GTD)** model. If you don't know what that is, do yourself a favor and spend $15 on amazon on this amazing book. I'm a relative newcomer to the system but it's amazing and almost everyone who's read it either swears by it or has adapted its lessons somehow. 
  

* Every thought, idea, reminder, question, etc that crosses my mind goes through a single filter: **""will this be something that I can resolve within 2 minutes or does it need to be recorded?""** If not, I record it in Wunderlist. **[My app is set up like this](https://imgur.com/a/DRxbG)**. These categories are essentially from GTD. I've heard some people will make specialized action lists like general to dos and focused to dos. I tried that but found that I had difficulty determining what was truly ""focused"" and what I could hold off on but still keep on a list so I just combined them so that I can review everything.
* Review, review, review!! I review all of my lists *nightly, weekly, quarterly, and yearly.* The worst feeling is having something on a list but losing track of it only for it to sneak up and bite you on your ass. I review my Wunderlist and calendar app every night so that I know what I missed and what I still need to do. I take this time to reorganize lists and push up or push back reminders and due dates. 
* I wake up early. Easier said than done, believe me. But for me to get some quiet, uninterrupted time to myself, I wake up early so I don't have to worry about taking time away from my family or feel anxious that I'm busy taking care of something when what I really want to be doing is studying or doing some work. Plus it gives me a sense of accomplishment at the beginning of my day so no matter what kind of day I have, I know that at the very least it started productive and I accomplished SOMETHING.
* I try to do--and schedule things to do--that only have a purpose. In other words, I tell myself in advance that I'm doing something with a distinct goal in mind and once I'm met that goal, I will move on. For example, I said to myself that I'm going to spend an hour to go on reddit to type out a post about my productivity system and answer any comments that may come in. That doesn't mean I'll first go on reddit to cruise through the front page for a little while, then write the post, then maybe check something else online. No. I went to this website for a distinct goal and I'm determined to accomplish that goal. Once I achieve my goal, I'll close the tab and work on the next thing on my list. **It goes without saying that this takes a lot of discipline and I often fail at this but the more time I get it right the better I get**
* I block time off. In the process of my nightly review I make sure that I block future time off for activities. That means if I know I have a block of 3 hours free the next day, I make sure I schedule exactly what I want to do during that time. That way, I stay honest during that free time instead of wasting half of the time farting around then half of the time feeling rushed and anxious because I wasted so much time. That also means that if I block time for family, then I avoid thinking about work. That also helps me eliminate anxiety about not studying or doing something for my job.
* I take time to reflect. That may be during a silent drive home, during nightly review (most often), or on a walk with my kids, etc. I make sure I reflect on things I learned, mistakes I made, and things I'd like to do. I let my mind wonder freely and creatively and I try to record as much of it as possible in my pocketbook or Wunderlist app. 
* I live in the ""now."" No I'm not trying to be cheesy and expound on the teachings of Eckhart Tolle, but what I mean is when I'm doing something, I make sure that my full attention is on that task and not wondering on to the next task or some problem I have. I learned this from my senior surgical mentors. You don't go through an operation just blindly doing things as you would when you drive home and you're on autopilot. You try to stay present and talk to yourself to make sure you're present and aware of what's happening. That means when I'm reading, I will talk to myself in my head and say things like ""ok so what I learned there is..."" or ""what was that paragraph supposed to teach me?"" It not only helps to keep me awake during mind numbing activities like lectures and administrative meetings, but it helps me remember what I experienced and record the things that may have popped into my head but quickly flew out because I was too busy thinking about some project I have due.

medicine,How do I walk the line of being a good patient while also making sure I do what's best for me when it comes to my own healthcare decisions?,"I'm an M4 with a new diagnosis of Crohn's. I have extremely mild symptomatology (occasional bloody but formed stool, no pain, fevers, diarrhea, etc). There is pathologic, radiologic, and laboratory evidence of at least moderately active bowel inflammation though.


After discussing with my gastroenterologist  (who is the PD at my home institution), he felt it makes most sense to put me on Pred or oral Budesonide, as I wish. I favour trialing Budesonide even though it's less efficacious, because of a better side effect profile. However, I did a bit of a literature search on the topic  when contemplating my decision, and he doesn't have me on the dosing that nearly every study uses. Studies are using 9mg x 2 months with subsequent taper, and he's suggesting I go on 9mg x 1 month, then 6 mg the next, then 3mg.

Budesonide is already less efficacious, so I prefer taking the 9mg x2m to maximize effect. I'm worried that if I approach him and point this out, he'll get annoyed with me because I'm questioning his judgment.


In essence, I am being a med student and I know I'm overstepping by getting too involved in the nity gritty of my care when I shouldnt. At the same time, I have seen SO many patients who advocated for their own care and did their research keep their doctors on top of their shit and come out better because of it. I've seen a lot of sloppiness similar to this from care teams lead to worse outcomes. I just don't know if this is a big enough deal to bring up to my GI or if I should just trust him and follow this protocol.

medicine,Nursing supervisor asks medical assistant to relay an order to me.,"*Deep sigh.*

So, admin decided that they wanted to spend about $2 million renovating one of our clinics in order to qualify for more grant money and incentives. This move affects our largest clinic in the middle of our busiest season. To achieve this, they are keeping a few clinicians in there while the renovation is taking place, and routing everybody else out into other clinics. 

The whole process has been handled in the worst way imaginable. To top this off, they decided to block our schedules from 3-6 yesterday to pack our stuff and have movers take our things over to our new designated sites. Well, we also have a policy that, no matter how late patients show up to their appointment, if they show up, we have to see them. So it's about 4:30 and I'm still seeing patients that have been showing up late, patients that walked in and needed to be added to the schedule, etc. Meanwhile, the movers and contractors are all over the clinic, trying to pack stuff, taking computers, etc. They keep putting a bunch of boxes all over my office so I can barely move, and they keep trying to take my computer and ask me how much longer I'll need to use it, etc. 

So then they are also working on our pediatric waiting area, and they decide to unplug the TV on the wall, leave the cables spread all over the floor, move a bookcase off the wall, and leave it in the middle of the waiting area. Of course, my patient's 2-year-old brother runs straight into the bookcase and gets a nice bump on his forehead. 

I know this family well, I make a brief assessment, discuss precautions with mom at large, warning signs, etc. She is reliable. I have no concerns - the kid is fine. The following day, I ask my nurse to call the family to check in and see how they're doing. Surprise! He's perfectly fine. 

Meanwhile, today I was at an all-day CME training. I get a frantic text from my assistant. ""Please call me asap when you get a minute."" So I step out and call her. 

This is how the conversation goes:

Medical assistant: ""So (nursing supervisor) stopped by today and asked about the kid that got hurt yesterday. She asked if you'd even seen the kid, and she demanded that I write an incident report, but she says I can't complete it unless I have more information about whether you saw the kid and what happened exactly.""

Me: ""okay. I will get around to doing it when I am back in the office. I am at a training all day today. Thanks - if she asks you again you can just let her know that she can talk to me directly.""

20 mins go by. I get another call from my assistant. She is crying. She says she is so sorry for what she is about to do, but that the nursing supervisor is forcing her to do it, and to please not be mad at her for the email she is going to send me. 

The email is addressed to me, has the nursing supervisor CC'd, and reads: 

Hello Dr. Kate1124,
 
Can you please let (nursing supervisor) know if you saw the patient who hit his head on the bookshelf, if so what did you do and how was the patient? If any exam was completed, it will also need to be documented in the patients chart.
Nursing supervisor will need an email back from you by 12:00pm due to the documentation needing to be processed in a timely manner.
 - Medical assistant. 


To say that I am absolutely LIVID is an understatement. I was waiting to be less angry before even attempting to write an email back to the nursing supervisor, but I am honestly at a loss here. I'm slightly ashamed to admit that a small part of me wants to simply ignore it, because if the nursing supervisor wants to ask something of me, she is just as able to write an email and address me directly -- not have my subordinate give me orders, putting them in a difficult place and undermining the hierarchy. 

As I see it now, my options are: 

1) Reply to the nursing supervisor letting her know that in the future, she should address her requests to me, and not put my support staff in charge of communicating orders to me. CC my medical director in this email. 

2) Ignore until I hear directly from her, but still let my medical director know how the situation was handled.

3) Secret option C -- your thoughts.

(Of note, my discussion with mom after the kid hurt his head is documented in the patient's chart.)

Thanks for the insight. 



**UPDATE**

Thanks for all the helpful comments and messages of support. I emailed the nursing supervisor, CC'd my medical director, and left the medical assistant out of the chain. 
Here is what I said:

Hello (Nursing Supervisor),
 
In the future, if you have any questions or requests for me, I would appreciate it if you could communicate directly with me, instead of asking my medical assistant to relay these types of messages. It really undermines the hierarchy to have a subordinate give me orders, and more importantly, it puts them in a difficult position.
 
My interaction with the patient in question was documented. If you need more information or have any other questions for me, we can discuss when I am back in the office.
 
Thank you, 

Dr. K.""

**UPDATE 2**

Nursing supervisor emails back and tells me she is offended that I chose to refer to my medical assistant as a subordinate. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.

**FINAL UPDATE**

Nursing Supervisor, 

I am sure you are aware of the chaos that was Tuesday — I was not done seeing patients until well after 4:30. The IT department was rushing me to get my computer. I needed to pack my things. I had boxes of other people’s stuff all over my office. I was also at a CME training all day yesterday. (Medical assistant) was aware, so I am assuming she relayed that information to you when you came looking for me and asking if I “had even seen the patient in question.” That being said, I kept receiving frantic text messages from her in regards to this particular issue, and it put her in a very awkward position, because she was made to feel like she had to act as the middle man between the two of us, and because she was under the impression that she would get in trouble if she didn’t hear from me with all the information you requested on that same day. Furthermore, I am fairly certain that the email that she sent out was not composed by her, and this, compounded by the fact that she texted me to apologize for the email she was being made to send to me, is why I think that this should have been communicated directly by you to me. It seems like there was a disconnect between what was asked, how MA perceived it, and thus, how she chose to relay the message to me. 

I am taken aback by your comment about finding my wording offensive. (MA) is a medical assistant who works UNDER my medical license (from Latin sub- ‘below.’) From a lexical semantics standpoint, some synonyms to the term “subordinate” include “supporting”, “ancillary”, and “auxiliary”, among others. These are all terms that are commonly used in medical organizations (including our own) to describe nursing staff and medical assistants who support the role of the physician in providing care to patients. MA and I are a great team, and she is invaluable to my practice. She is well aware of this because I consistently make it a point of communicating this to her on a daily basis -- something I have been doing for the years that we have been working together. The choice of wording was in no way meant to undermine her value.

medicine,What do you intend to do if the saline/bicarb/etc shortage gets really serious?,"I was talking with the chief of staff for a major metropolitan hospital in a top 10 city and he was saying they’re having problems keeping crash carts stocked with bicarb and jokingly said they’ll start mixing baking soda with bottled water, because “hell they’re already dead, so infection risk kinda goes out the door at that point.” But that made me wonder, let’s say during a current shortage there’s an MCI or something happens and suddenly you don’t have enough bicarb and saline, then what? Fuck ‘em? What if you have patients on long term fluid therapy or grandma rolls into the ED dry as a bone or you don’t even have bags to inject basic antibiotics or meds into?
