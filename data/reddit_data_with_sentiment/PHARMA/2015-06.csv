My questions are: 

1. What are your daily lives like? 

2. Are procedures different (i.e dealing with gunshot wounds, shrapnel?) 

3. Is the equipment the same or does it differ?

4.  What is a common injury that soldiers report?

5. If you have being posted to an overseas base are the facilities the same or is it completely different?

pharmacy,Patient dropped off altered script for oxycodone,"Warning: long!

Last week while working one of our regular patients came in with her monthly rx for oxycodone. Let's call her Ann. Ann handed me the paper copy and I did a quick glance for all the usual stuff, doctors DEA number, patients birthday, last fill date etc and everything looked good. I told her I could fill it for her and asked if she'd like to wait. Ann said she was going to run an errand but would be right back and was very friendly and pleasant for someone who isn't usually very chatty. After she left I went to work on it for her and as soon as I started I noticed some funny business. The doctors DEA number was traced over with another pen (like someone wrote over the letters again) which I noticed when it was dropped off but I figured the pen died or what have you, but a lot of the rest of the script was ""written over"" like that too. Odd. Then I noticed the sig said to take it q6h but I wasn't certain if it was a 6 or a 5. That is also odd as I've never seen a script for a c2 that doesn't have at least legible numbers. Then I noticed that the quantity was #180 and the written one hundred eighty the word eighty looked VERY bizarre, it was half cursive and looked like the doctor forgot how to spell it. MDD quantity was also illegible. So I called the doctors office and this is how the call transpired.
Me: Hi I'm calling from X pharmacy to get clarification on a script we had dropped off from a mutual patient
Nurse: Okay patients birthday 
*typical phone call progression*
M:I'm just not sure if the hourly dose is a 5 or a 6 and the rest of this looks kinda weird so I just wanted to verify.
N: It's supposed to be a 5, what's the quantity on there?
M: 180
N: It's supposed to be 150! My partners sloppy handwriting she could have turned the 5 into an 8 easily! What's the MDD?
M: *everything falls into place* She tried to give herself 6 day and wrote over it and everything else to make it seem intentional, what do you want me to do with it?
N: Can you fax it or mail it back to us?

Fast forward to patient coming back and we tell her we had to call, she got a little pale and asked if there was a problem. She left and came back and said her doctor said for her to bring the rx back there. I said well they told us to mail it back to them earlier so it is in the mail. She left immediately.

Yesterday I got a call from a police officer  asking me what happened and he told me she said she put the script through the wash and then she tried to make it so we could see what it said. The wash! Really?! He asked me if it looked like it had been washed and I said absolutely not it was in pristine condition and was written the same day she brought it in. 
Today I spoke to the officer and he said he was issuing a warrant and I might get subpoenaed. So we'll see what happens, I couldn't believe her lame attempt to cover her ass!

medicine,The CNS and Lymphatic System have been linked through the discovery of functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. [Nature],"In the vast majority of anatomy textbooks, the connection between the lymphatic system and central nervous system (CNS) is nonexistent. In physiology and in human immunobiology books, it is known that a constant immunosurveilance of the CNS exists. This article appears to shed some light on previously unknown anatomy and immunophysiologic features within mice. Hopefully this discovery builds up momentum to drive similar investigation in humans, allowing for possible discoveries in the etiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.

Edit: apparently something happened and I broke the internet. I add the link here:

How do you guys deal with shift work?,"I've been an intern for 5 months now - my first rotation was Gen Surg, which had a little shift work (it would either be day shifts from 7am-5pm, or evening shifts from 2pm-10pm, or weekend shifts from 8am-10pm) which wasn't too bad, and then I was on psych which was 8:30am-5pm Mon-Fri with no on calls or covers (hated the specialty, but loved the hours).

Now I'm on ED, and I am struggling with the shift work - this week I started off on normal daytime shifts, then switched to evening shifts and I'm just exhausted. I have nights coming up next which I am worried about. I didn't deal too well with nights in med school on the rare occasion I had to do them (O&amp;G, etc.) - I had trouble sleeping during the day, felt exhausted around midnight, and then usually bailed by 2am (which I obviously can't do now that I'm an intern), and was pretty much a zombie the next day.

I'm aware that we probably have it really, really good here in Australia with our hours, etc., but does anyone have any advice on how to do nights/shift work in the most efficient and energetic way?

pharmacy,Guide on How to be a good Retail Customer,"In order to be a good retail customer (remember this is for your own sake mainly) you need to start by having your life in order when you come into the pharmacy. This guide will give you details on how to prepare for the dreaded walk up to the ""drop off"" counter and beyond.

* **TL; DR version by popular demand**

**Top 5 ways to be a better retail customer**

1. Have a pickup time in mind at drop off. Be reasonable.

2. Call in your refills at least 24 hours ahead to anticipate issues.

3. Have a list of what you need to pick up before you buy the wrong thing

4. Ask questions to be sure you are taking your meds optimally

5. Be polite! Dont hold up the line if there is an issue, stay off your cell phone, etc

Ok now on to the long version for more details and useless ranting.

1) **Focus** on your task at hand

* Know what you need filled

* Stay off your cell phone. This not only wastes everyone's time, but could also cause you to make a mistake in telling the pharmacy what you need or forgetting insurance/coupon which will delay your filling time greatly or cost you money. Often, I am on the phone with a doctor while taking an rx for entry and if the person is also on their cell phone it becomes a total clusterfuck of miscommunication
 
2) Helping to fill out your prescription (if these things aren't already there). These things will save you from answering a couple questions and make it easy for the pharmacy to look you up. 

* Put your date of birth on the Rx

* If it is a controlled substance, write your address in the address line

* Put down a phone number so we have it on the Rx in case there is an issue, we have an updated number.

3) Insurance

* If your insurance is new, bring your card. 

* If you think the pharmacy has your card on file. Bring your card. The pharmacy cannot easily call for your insurance information because if your plan changed, it could be with any of about 15+ PBMs which have us on hold for 15+ min each so we cannot call.

* If you are using a manufacturers coupon, check to see if it has to be activated (by calling their 1800 number). If it does, DO THIS BEFORE GETTING TO THE PHARMACY. This process takes some time and could delay you from picking up your prescription if you do not do it.

* If you are using a manufacturer coupon keep it on you or a picture of it on your phone, even if it is on file. We will probably need it, at least at every new refill of the Rx

* A discount card (the one you get for free in the mail) is  not insurance, it will not work with your insurance, and it is not cheaper than your insurance. 

4) **KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO PICK UP YOUR PRESCRIPTION.** Is it too much to ask?

* Every single person, I'd say 99%, if asked when they want to pick it up say ""When can you have it ready?"" I don't know, how does next Saturday sound?

* The usual wait time for a pharmacy is around 15 minutes if not busy and maybe 30 minutes (if busy) to 1 hour if extremely busy. 

* Please think about it though. Most of the time, if it is an Rx from the ER or urgent care or acute meds, I know you want to wait and will ask you ""do you want to wait around for this?"" But do you really need to wait for the Rx that was written 2 weeks ago for your cholesterol medication that you haven't filled in 4 months?

* Be respectful of the people who did just get out of the ER after being there for 5 hours, or the ones just leaving surgery/dentist. I'm talking to you: person who drops off their dogs gabapentin refill and demands to wait at 5pm on a Monday with 4 children with ear infections right behind them.

* I'll be honest. I would **NOT** want my Rx checked by the pharmacist for anything even remotely new or complicated if it were during a busy time and I was waiting. You want to be safe, we want you to be safe. Don't pressure the pharmacist if you don't have to. 

* If your pharmacy is notoriously behind in getting things ready. Set your pickup time for lets say 7pm and them come later (8pm) that day or the next day. 

5) Use technology to your advantage

* Get text alerts (but please read the text carefully). These can tell you when something is ready, so you don't have to pressure the pharmacy but can still pick it up as soon as its done. But some pharmacies text you for refill reminders as well. Be sure that it isn't asking you about that before you come in and believe something is ready for you.

* Check the app or online to see if the prescription is ready, also to show the price along with any billing discrepancies you might have questions/answers for.

* Even using the automated phone service can get refills 24/7 and let you know when things are ready.

* Ask for automatic refills to keep your medications ready if they are ones you will be on long term

6) Picking up the Rx

* Don't pick up during rush hours (4:30 to 6PM at my pharmacy) if you can avoid it. Why would you do this to yourself? I understand its on the way home from work, but it will take 5 times as long to get through the line and we wont be able to fix any billing issues or answer questions as quickly/thoroughly, which could cost you another trip or delay dinner.

* We will ask for the patient's birthday (to be sure we don't give you someone else's meds) so please have it ready

* Know what you are picking up and what you aren't picking up (bring a list if you cant remember).

* If picking up for someone else: I view this as when my wife asks me to buy her makeup. She better tell me **EXACTLY** what I need to buy, with pictures (or a list), as well as how much it should cost.

* Keep in mind the pharmacy is not usually allowed to take returns for medications that have left the pharmacy due to inability to resell them because of possible damage/contamination (would you want a medication that someone took home and did god knows what to?) So picking up the wrong thing could be costly. 

7) Questions/Counseling?

* Please ask questions about your meds. Especially if it is new and even if the doctor went over it: it is very possible that the pharmacist has additional insight and tips on how to take the meds or how to deal with the side effects.

* Make a list of questions you have in mind if there are a lot. I feel like most patients you tell them things and then they forget 10 minutes later. Write down or have the pharmacist write down answers so you can always remember the important points about your meds.

* The pharmacist (at least at the chains) provide FREE and unbiased advice by a doctorate educated (most) registered healthcare professional. We don't get commissions for recommending store brand, we don't get kickbacks from drug companies, we don't have a quota to meet related to counseling/recommending OTC products.

* The downside is that we can be very busy at times, often juggling multiple issues and so we may give you a quick answer for a question during those times. If possible call back or come in during a slower time (lunch times when doctors are closed or after rush hours at night) so you can get more time with the pharmacist.

8) Refills

* call in your refill at least 24 hours ahead of time.

* Expect the pharmacy to be out of your medication (again why we call 24 hours ahead of time)

* Keep up with refills remaining, hint: they are on the bottle. If you are on your last refill and need the pharmacy to try to contact your doctor for a refill, let us know 7+ days before you run out. Doctors are busy and may not respond.

9) Bring the staff a gift, preferably food.

* Ok so I am biased on this one, but all our best customers have brought us a gift. Especially if you are in the pharmacy a few times per month and get a lot of meds, the gift is worth it. It doesn't have to be often, just enough for us to remember you. 

* Food: personally I'm not picky. I'd say maybe a cheese pizza is a safe pick though. Something easy to eat while standing up is a must. Food is also not ""weird"" (see below).

* Most pharmacy staff has gotten a ""weird"" gift. Like a picture of someone's deceased daughter (yeah it was strange, but what can you say) or flowers (cringe) so just stick with food to be safe.

* Don't think of it as a gift. Think of it as your payment to be on our VIP list. If you bought us a pizza, I can guarantee we are filling your meds first, double checking your copays, prioritizing your billing problems and  trying our best to ""pay you back.""  We can't exactly give you any special pricing (its all up to your insurance) but we can double check your meds for manufacturer rebates and let you know about cheaper alternatives.

We have an older lady that comes in about twice every two weeks, she's pretty nice and has been my bosses customer for 15 years now. She tells us all about her life (used to be a hooker, got shot 3 times etc) but the funniest thing I've heard come out of her mouth is ""suckin dick ain't hard, itd be easier now tho, that's for damn sure!"" As she pops her fake teeth in and out of her mouth. 

I have never looked at her the same.

She also brings us homemade food all the time but she can't cook for shit, so we have to lie to her and hide the food when she's around. (Boss doesn't wanna hurt her feelings because she's been around for so long)

medicine,"""Medical terms"" the general public uses that you never hear health professionals use (or are used incorrectly)","Thought we could get a list going of terms you hear lay people throwing around either in real life or in movies/TV that you either never hear in the real world or are just plain wrong.

1. **""He's in shock.""** Of course we use the term 'shock' in the medical world to refer to inadequate perfusion/hypotension leading to end-organ damage. I always hear lay people use it to refer more to an acute stress reaction.
2. **""He got his stomach pumped.""** I have literally never heard a medical professional use this phrase.  I think lay people are referring to a gastric lavage which is just rarely  (if ever) clinically indicated anymore.
3. **""He's in a coma.""** Seen/heard on every soap opera ever.  Obviously we use the Glasgow Coma Scale all the time in trauma and see patients at all levels of consciousness but I have never heard a physician say the words, ""he's in a coma.""

pharmacy,Today we went so far down the help desk rabbit hole we found ourself.,"Last month a prescription for a patient went through just fine, just like all the months before. Today it did not. Suddenly there was a rejection accompanied by some kind of hieroglyphic description of the problem. This was on a compound, so there could be any of a dozen reasons for the rejection. 

I didn't actually make the call but was standing nearby and listened in. The other pharmacist was transferred from one department to another, from ESI to Aetna, and back again. All because of the simple question ""Why is this rejecting?""

Finally, at the end of this chain, the last person on the other end had no where else to transfer us. The pharmacist asked for the manager, this was the manager, the pharmacist asked is there an HR department, a clinical staff member, hell, the janitor, is there ANYONE who has the answer? 

Yes, the help desk person replied, you could ask the provider! The provider? Exactly who do you mean by that? Why, you, the pharmacist I'm talking to, you will know why this claim is rejecting. 

Would you like the provider's phone number?

medicine,What is your position on patients gaining unrestricted access to their medical records?,"I personally think creating an easy vector by which patients can access the information that they paid for makes perfect sense. As a patient, it is extremely frustrating to feel that my medical records aren't accessible to me. I know there are movements towards making notes more available such as [Opennotes](http://www.myopennotes.org/what-is-opennotes-2/why-open-visit-notes/) and government initiatives like [Bluebutton](http://healthit.gov/patients-families/your-health-data). This said, there seems to be considerable push back by providers against this movement, citing workflow disruptions, patients becoming confused by ""complicated"" information and the general notion that it is ""great in theory but would never work in practice"". As a medical student, I am curious to hear some opinions of providers farther along in their careers. 


EDIT: As a follow up to my initial post, I'm curious if anyone in the role of patient would prefer to not have access to their own records? I initially thought that most, if not everyone, would prefer to have access to the information that they paid for. Based on the response I've received, it seems that this isn't the case.

medicine,"Weight loss in Insulin ""Dependent"" Type 2 diabetics? Back to basics.","Young PA-C here, I manage heart failure patients in a low-income region. I see plenty of obese, insulin-using diabetics who would like to lose weight and make diet modifications due to recent dx of CAD or HF. I encourage these people to cut back on foods with high glycemic index, eat 5-6 smaller meals daily and begin a specific progressive walking regimen. I encourage them to eat plenty of vegetables and fish/white meat. I push aspects of the Mediterranean diet that best line up with the patient's ability and agenda.

Sometimes I see patients who present from the diabetologist and have been told to ""eat more carbohydrates"". This is what brings me to you r/medicine. It baffles me. I can't comprehend titrating our carbohydrates to insulin level. More carbs + more insulin = more lipid synthesis. 

I know we need to avoid hypoglycemia and DKA in these patients, but how can I encourage fatty acid oxygenation and lipolysis with all of this insulin and sugar floating around?

Alternatively, if we  were to decrease high glycemic foods, could even the most insulin ""dependent"" late-Type2ers be able to pull back on their insulin regimen? 

Does there come a point in a sedentary late DMT2 where weight loss is impossible due to hormonal/metabolic/gene-expressive changes?

Additionally, my personal opinion is that non-DM patients can experience best weight loss from low-carb lifestyle, healthy balanced variations of Mediterranean, South Beach, Paleo and Keto. Diet as mentioned above, with only limited intake of ""healthy"" carbohydrates such as quinoa, whole grain, brown rice. I understand these lifestyles limit overall caloric intake, decrease insulin spikes, increase glucagon, increase lipolysis, increase FA oxidation. What is the role and limiting factors of these diets in DMT2? 

I don't want to de-emphasize exercise but of course a lot of these patients are limited by arthritis or orthopedic issues, and diet may be our only modifiable.

Any specific information or papers from anyone experienced in the field is highly appreciated. Particularly from those who have experience with weight loss in diabetics. Or if you would just like to rant about biochemical theories we could do that too.

pharmacy,I don't care about patients,"I am a fourth year student and just recently finished my community pharmacy IPPE. It was my first time working in a pharmacy and overall I found the experience fulfilling and learned a lot. The pharmacy was very low-volume, so I had the opportunity to meaningfully interact with patients and provide counseling (mostly OTC) instead of being a workhorse for a 900 script-a-day Rite Aid. If I've learned one thing about my experience, it is that I don't think retail is for me. When I see patients, I view them as problems to be solved rather than actual humans who are suffering. I have no ill feelings against them, it's just that I don't actually care about them or their wellbeing. If you saw me with patients, you'd probably think I am very good with them; I will go above and beyond to make a patient happy - but to me it is all an act.

Perhaps it is because I have yet to encounter something that will make me care? Perhaps I am immature and selfish? When I hear other people talk about patients, they seem to have a genuine interest in helping them and I just don't understand it. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and how to treat people who are sick, but more so on a conceptual level rather than an emotional one. Any thoughts or comments on how I should approach this? I want to continue my journey in pharmacy but I'd rather be doing things where I don't need to fake my concern for others.

medicine,Finished intern year. Don't know if I want to continue this field.,"As the title says, I about to finish my intern year in pediatrics. Why did I go into pediatrics? I honestly don't remember by now. I really liked it in medical school, especially all the ICUs. I always wanted to go into surgery, EM, or another more ""hands on"" specialty, but changed my mind in August of my 4th year of med school. I applied for Pediatrics, and landed in a good program, with great colleagues, and a ridiculously varied pathology that only a few people in the nation see. 

However, I feel like I want more. My need to be more hands on is resurfacing, and I don't know what to do. I plan to bring it up to my mentor or associate program director soon, but I don't have a clue about what to do afterwards. I don't know if it would be better to apply during PL-2 year, and change residencies by the end of that year, or if I should apply during PL-3 year, and finish the Peds residency. My wife is doing residency in the same city and I have all of her support to go into any field that will make me happy.

Any recommendations for an intern who is currently on night float with all of these thoughts in his head? Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Edit: As some have suggested, this is not the intern blues. I enjoy some days at work. I am generally happy.

pharmacy,Working for an Independent pharmacy that does not follow state law--should I GTFO,"UPDATE: Thanks guys for all the comments/advice! I've decided to GTFO and apply for another job. Sucks to be in this position, but I know it's for the better. Question about the C2 log. I dispensed a couple C2's this week and signed my name in the C2 log book. If/when the DEA/BOP makes a visit to the pharmacy and they discover the discrepancies (which they are bound to find), will I be charged as a result? What can I do to protect myself now? I'm worried they might use my initials for the supposed inventory that they conducted this week.

Thanks again for all your input. Seriously means a lot to me.

original post: I started working for an Independent pharmacy, owned by a sister and brother (both pharmacists). It definitely has its perks: not having to work past 6:00 pm on a weekday, less volume of prescriptions to be checked, easy commute to work. But there were a few major red flags that showed up:

1.)They treat their primary technician as a pseudo pharmacy intern: when doctors call in new prescriptions, he takes them. If a prescription needs to be verified/changed, he does it. 

2.)C2 log book is not up to date: When I took a look, some pages were missing and the counts of some of the medications were off....wtf????????

3.)The prescription processing software (RX30) is old and does not require the pharmacist to approve of the interactions before the prescriptions are sent via insurance. Basically, from what I've seen, the primary tech just rushes through them and processes them and the pharmacist isn't able to see what interactions have popped up. I've used PDX before in the past, and when an interaction popped up, it'd require the pharmacist to take a look and type in a password before it got processed, but RX30 doesn't seem to do this. Anyone know how to do a ""print-screen"" of interactions using RX30?

4.)Missing hardcopies (!!!!) and hardcopies that are missing the ""back label sticker"" detailing which drug was used, drug QTY, what date it was filled, SIG, etc

5.)dispensing drugs with the wrong NDC number: this isn't actually a law where I work, but they're fine with not updating the system with the actual NDC used as long as it's the same drug (and strength). I feel like this increases the risk of the wrong drug being dispensed (no scanning system) which has apparently happened before I started working for them.

6.)""Final Check"": For the owners, the final check consists of verifying the correct drug and quantity. To my knowledge, I am the only one who will actually pull hard copies and check for accuracy (I've found a good amount of mistakes that the owners have overlooked).

Before anyone asks, ""well, have you voiced your concern with the owners?"" yes, I have, on more than one occasion. Basically the response that I got was that I should run the pharmacy the way that I feel comfortable with...which YES I have been trying my best, but that still leaves a lot of room for potential errors without the other two pharmacists changing how they manage the pharmacy. I feel like they're stuck in their ways, and I need to consider leaving, especially if I'm potentially compromising my reputation and pharmacist license.

The only thing holding me back is the fact that it's really difficult to find a pharmacist job in the area that I live. But is it worth it to stay? 

Also sidenote: I asked the owners how the past BOP visits were. They said that the BOP is very lax and that they've never been fined in the past.

tldr: started working for an Independent pharmacy, saw that they don't follow plenty of state laws, worried about my own pharmacist license, should I stay for experience/for the sake of having a job or GTFO",17,20,2015-06-19,PHARMA,0.1047729030251503,0.8709725141525269,0.02425464615225792

The general belief is that here in the UK, it ""only takes 5 years"" to become a doctor, which is technically true, but in reality, 2 foundation years must be taken to become ""properly qualified"".

So here is my rant.

I am an international student. I am paying £16,000 per year for the first two years, and £30,000 per year for the last three. This does not include living costs etc., totalling about £124,000.

Year 6. I start at £22,000. Year 7, £30,000. Year 8, £32,000.

I'm sure you can all see that this sort of starting wage is simply not enough to pay the loans taken out for university. On top of this, living costs in the UK are relatively high.

Maybe this is why UK doctors are leaving the country and the NHS, flocking to the U.S. and Australia, ~~where a recruitment bonus of $100,000 is given commonly.~~

/rant.

So why am I writing this? Maybe I am arrogant, entitled and am completely wrong to think that this sort of salary is just *not enough*.

My class is graduating medical school this summer and moving on to intern year. I wanted to give everyone a graduation gift but I own a negative amount of money.

Could interns/PGY1-2 give input as to what they would like to see on such a card?

medicine,"Looked up my own medical records, am I going to get fired?","I made a really dumb and absent minded choice to look up my own medical records. It said that I had been discharged (as a patient) and I exited out. It didn't allow me to see anything really. I'm not a doctor.

Realistically, am I going to get fired? Will they certainly catch it? I can't my find my hospital's policy but I remember that it fits into a lower tier (""curiosity w/o personal gain"") violation of their policy. 

I should add that I have not yet attended the hospital's employee orientation, although I probably signed some HIPAA paperwork.  

edit: thanks for the input. I looked up the hospital's policy. It is against policy but its a lower-tier violation. I'm a new hire though.

FINAL EDIT: Nothing has happened to me so far, but maybe during the week it will come up. I think its worth mentioning that I used the Cerner medication manger (an inpatient pharmacy software), not the Cerner program for pt charts. So perhaps this wouldn't generate a flag. If I do get fired, I will make another post so that I may be a cautionary tale.

At the very least, I don't have a mortgage, student loans, or kids. I also don't really need the money in the short term as I have a lovely nuclear family who would be happy to have me back.

The pharmacist said it would be fine to change it to the 100 and double the quantity and instructions. But then recently, a patient came from the same urgent care with a script for hydroxyzine 50, and we had none. Same pharmacist immediately suggested ordering it or finding it at another store.

These positions seem plentiful but I'm hesitant to do more training at a point in my career when those who went directly into industry are already in senior scientist roles. I've also heard that these positions are often treated like extended interviews and that it's a great way to get your 'foot in the door'.

pharmacy,First Day Overnight - Fresh Outta School,"Hello r/pharmacy, long time lurker, first time poster

I just graduated in May, passed my boards, and have been scheduled to work my first shift ever as a solo pharmacist overnight (10pm-8am) at one of the big chain stores tomorrow night. I have been an intern at this chain for about 6 months while on rotations and there is no extra training because I was already an intern. I have also searched SDN and this subreddit for advice but have not found anything comprehensive enough to keep my nervousness at bay.

My question is what should I expect and be expected to accomplish in the overnight shift/first ever shift as a pharmacist? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks and Be Well.

EDIT: Thanks for the great advice, I'll be sure to update after my shift!

POST SHIFT EDIT: So things went fairly well last night although I'm unsure if I gave a bunch of people rhabdo or not. 

Being sole in charge wasn't too bad. At some points i the night it was dead and I kept busy with refills, delete lists, restocking OTC, robots, etc... I did not have a single Norco script overnight which seemed different from what I was expecting. The morning rush started at about 5:30 when a bunch of DURs/scripts came up in the system at once and continued until the end of my shift at 8 am. The problems that were coming up, I was able to handle and all of the overnight pharmacists were a great help when I needed them. It felt weird to verify after typing the script because I KNEW I picked the right things but I was not necessarily looking at it with a fresh pair of eyes. Thank you to the reddit community for helping prepare me for my first shift, I definitely utilized your advice.

A couple of notes: got a MAJOR DUR for Keflex (allergy) and Tessalon pearls? Tons of DURs for some combination of gemfibrozil/fenofibrate and statins that I had to use the patient's profile to override but the risk of rhabdo still scares me. Also citalopram DURs: is there any reason someone would be on citalopram and venlafaxine at the same time?",15,15,2015-06-27,PHARMA,0.05062633752822876,0.9124369621276855,0.03693670406937599

medicine,"I am shadowing an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow, and I have no idea what I am doing!","So I did not know where to post this so it may seem a bit out of place. Well, my high school has a senior project every student must complete that focuses on our research and focus regarding our lifelong career goals. I am asking about one aspect of this project, the shadowing and interview. My project focuses around a career as an orthopedic surgeon as I said before. To this point I have made a list of questions to ask the doctor once I am done with my day shadowing him. I am confused and unprepared as how I should act in the operating room, as I will be observing several cases, and how I should act towards the doctor, he is young but a very prominent figure in all of medicine. Any responses are much appreciated, as I will be shadowing the surgeon tomorrow, July 1st.
