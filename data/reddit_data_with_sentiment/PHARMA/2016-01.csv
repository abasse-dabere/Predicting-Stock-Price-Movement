******
Not sure [this will link properly](https://twitter.com/MedCrisis/status/682548008861483008), there should be 3 videos of a left ventricular assist device being closed percutaneously. This is something I've never seen before and I imagine I won't see again. Normally patients die or get transplanted, but in this case the patient was no longer fit for transplant and was being treated palliatively so it was decided to close the VAD rather than explant it with the associated surgical risk.

medicine,Why Your Culture Does Not Matter To Me,"Hello r/medicine. Can you critique this writing? I would like to see how my views align with other people in medicine.  

I am a student in a health care profession. I see many different people every day that come to seek treatment at my school. Most patients are local to our area, but many come to our school’s clinic from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds. Our curriculum has recently been updated in accordance with the board of accreditation that our state mandates for professional schools. This curriculum includes a course entitled ‘Cultural Awareness.’ The goals of the course, as stated by the syllabus and our professor, is to:  

1. Emphasize, illustrate and analyze how patient’s background, culture, beliefs and norms may impact health and health outcomes; 
2. Enhance understanding of legal boundaries and provider’s responsibilities in the delivery of care;
3. Enhance the students understanding of cultural, various societal values and traditions that must be considered during the delivery of care, doctor-patient interactions and treatment outcomes; 
4. Increase awareness of the challenges and mechanisms for providing services to special populations.
Except for the second objective, I am not interested in learning about any of these. I am going to illustrate to you why classes like these are a farce, a waste of our time as professionals, and demeaning to every intelligent culture.  

As a professional healthcare worker, I am bound by a code of ethics. In fact, this code is a defining aspect of the culture found among healthcare professionals. This code includes virtues like veracity, nonmaleficence, justice, beneficence, and patient autonomy. These virtues lay the groundwork for almost every aspect of clinical decision-making in healthcare. It is a defining aspect of healthcare culture. This code is well recognized by people within and without the healthcare system as it is the basis for the credibility patients give to their doctors, nurses, dentists, optometrists, etc.   

When a patient walks into a clinic and wants treatment, this culture allows them to be sure of what they are walking into. The code of ethics is unchanging and unwavering. It is a cornerstone of healthcare because without it, patients could not trust their healthcare providers to give them a high quality of healthcare.  

Why do I mention professional healthcare culture? Because when a patient walks into the office, it is the only one that truly matters. Do not misunderstand me. I respect my patients. I would never be intentionally rude to them or purposefully disrespect their culture without reason to do so. What I am saying is that when it comes to the treatment of my patients, the ethics of my profession are the only ones that matter because they are rooted in scientific fact and are designed to emphasize the patient’s best interest.  

The cultural awareness class that we are taking required us to read a book called ‘The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down’ by Anne Fadiman. The book describes the medical treatment of a girl from Laos whose family is part of the Hmong culture, which have some beliefs that are not typical in Western culture. The girl, Lia Lee, began having life-threatening seizures at a very early age and was hospitalized many times in her childhood before eventually becoming severely brain damaged and dying. Throughout the family’s experience, they would take Lia to the hospital, try communicating with doctors, and either refuse treatment or not follow up with adequate home care due to their beliefs stemming from the Hmong culture and the language barrier that was present in the family. The Hmong are believers in medicine men and shaman. They also have beliefs about medicine that conflict with available scientific research, such as animal sacrifice and spirits that can affect our physical world.  

These beliefs by Lee’s parents was the reason for many of the communication problems with her doctors, their unwillingness to cooperate with the advice of their healthcare providers, and their refusal to follow through with much of Lia’s needed homecare. The book describes the doctors being unwilling to try to adapt to the Lee’s culture and try to understand the Lee’s point of view.   

What exactly is there to understand in this case? The doctors knew the illness, knew the medically reasonable treatment for her illness, and, perhaps most importantly, the Lee’s sought their help. The Lee’s were in no position to try and prescribe treatment for a sick child. They had no prior medical training and their culture was at best quirky and at worst a system of beliefs that run directly against logic and reason. The doctors were in an American hospital regulated by laws of the profession. They had no reason to adapt. They were on their home turf and the Lee’s were coming to them.  

It is fine if the Lees or any other people who wish to participate in a culture do so in their own personal lives, but when they come to medical professionals, it is not their place to endanger other people’s lives by interjecting their own unsubstantiated cultural remedies in place of scientifically proven treatments. Additionally, cultures exist everyone and for every individual. It is absolutely ridiculous to think that everyone should be accommodating and adaptive to every single person. It is impractical. Respect cultures according to the situation.  

I was recently looking at Facebook and on my wall, I ran across two posts that made my blood boil. One was an anti-vaccine supporter and the other was a person complaining about the mercury in amalgam cavity fillings. The anti-vaccine supporter was angry that their child was required to get a mumps shot for school and were convinced that the doctors were going to give her baby autism. The complainer about mercury in amalgam was ranting about her teeth and the dentist that was going to remove all the ‘harmful’ fillings she had received over the years. These are the sorts of culture that I refuse to respect in any way, shape, or form. They are blatantly wrong. Amalgam has been used in fillings for decades and numerous studies have confirmed its safety. Vaccine use is mandated because it not only immunizes people against horrible diseases, but it also provides herd immunity to those with weakened immune systems. It has been repeatedly shown that vaccines and the instances of autism have no correlation. The doctor responsible for the study claiming that they were is an absolute fraud and has been stripped of his medical license.  

Today’s culture has become obsessed with political correctness and acceptance of all people and beliefs. You are entitled to your beliefs, but I am also entitled to mine. I will not respect you if you are contradicting known medical facts with the garbage you learned on Dr. Oz or the neighbor selling essential oils. I will tell you that you are wrong and that it is my duty to tell you so. You will receive high-quality, evidence based care from me regardless of your culture. I will be as polite and accommodating as I can practically be, but you are in my office. Your beliefs do not supersede mine. At most they are equal. I will not trample your beliefs unless they are stupid. I define stupid as ideas that are not supported by evidence done in a medical trial.  

Your culture does not matter when healthcare professionals are treating you. Your health matters. Your livelihood matters. Everything else is secondary. I am not advocating for a total ignorance of cultural differences. They belong where manners and etiquette are involved. Life and death situations or those involving the health of individuals does not have any room for cultural beliefs that are contrary to the practitioner’s method of care. You are entitled to your opinion even if you are wrong, but I will not accommodate you, respect your judgment, or treat you in a manner that is not consistent with the best treatment available.  

**EDIT 1**: This response has been awesome. I have received some really great feedback, and it is clear that healthcare professionals are quite passionate about this topic. I want to refer anyone else reading this/coming back to blast me on it to u/lwronhubbard answer below. I think he does a great job arguing for the purpose of culture in medicine. I also wrote a response explaining my writing to u/frank_and_beans. Hope it clears up why I wrote like this and some of my responses to you. I think that professionals need to always be thinking about what part culture plays in their decision making and their patient's lives. If anyone ever searches for something like this questions and finds this thread, I wanted to make a record of the arguments that they will hear and understand all sides of the issue. I figured Reddit would have something to say to a blatantly one-sided argument, and damn did you guys not disappoint.

My GF is in her 6th year of Pharmacy at Rutgers doing rotations.

What are her options now? She wants to work in industry. Can she still apply to fellowships or can she apply to non-fellowship positions? What are the pros/cons of non-fellowship positions when compared to the fellowship program?

I had been in the adult ICU for a grand total of three months at that point, only about 2 weeks off orientation and on my own.  I had two pts, one on a vent fairly stable and another 62 y/o male post op some kind of bowel resection, past hx of CAD, heavy smoker and ETOH, COPD.  Soon as I got there, he just didn't look good, mild respiratory distress.  I wait a few minutes and he's definitely not breathing well at all, call an RRT and we intubate.  He becomes less responsive by the minute, BP 60/palpable, then goes into PEA, coded him.  It was my very first code, and didn't exactly go as well as I hoped.  Someone gave me the backboard to slide underneath for compressions, and in my nervousness it slipped out of my hands and cracked the other nurse right across the head, knocking her to the floor.  So my director is there trying to manage the code while checking on my coworker (who is cursing at me while attempting to get up) and trying to teach me stuff about codes.  It was a *bit* of a mess.  For the curious, pt ended up coding again two hours later and finally expired.

medicine,[META] /r/medicine mods would like your opinions on the sub.,"/r/medicine’s mods are looking for some suggestions, feedback, and recommendations to help keep this subreddit a high quality community. We try to run a metapost at least once or twice a year to stay in touch with the community’s opinions on the sub and to solicit feedback on moderation - and that’s where we'd like to hear from you.

Specifically, we’re looking for feedback on the subreddit rules and enforcement, as well as for suggestions for improvement or concerns about the content or moderation of the subreddit. We’d like to know what you like most and least about /r/medicine, what you’d like to see changed, and how you think we ought to do that.

Over the last few days, we’ve made some minor changes to the wording of some of the rules with the aims of removing ambiguity and of allowing us to enforce them more consistently. The content of the rules is not significantly changed but we have reordered them in descending order of frequency of enforcement and importance to us as moderators. We’ve also migrated the list of related subreddits to the [/r/medicine wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/wiki/index) to free up some space on the sidebar, which was getting clunky.

&gt;**No advertising or fundraising.** We do not allow posts that solicit funding for any cause or that exist primarily to advertise.

This rule would cover some posts that are technically not in violation of any current rules (expect perhaps the one against personal agendas) but are not in the spirit of the sub and tend to be received poorly by the community anyway before they’re removed. Bona fide recommendations of a certain book or website or something like that are still allowed and encouraged; this rule would mostly exist to stop the spam about conferences, paid courses or apps, etc. Like all of our rules currently are, it’d be enforced at the discretion of the mods on a case-by-case basis with the aim of keeping the quality of the sub high. If you can see any problems with the addition of this rule, please do speak up.

So, have you got any comments, concerns, or criticisms about the sub or its rules and moderation? What would be most helpful with any suggestions or feedback would be to provide a link to a comment or thread that exemplifies your suggestion so that we can see what you mean in proper context. We'll leave this post up for a week and discuss your suggestions both here in this thread and among ourselves as mods before acting on them as appropriate.

Please bear in mind that this is a community of over 61,000 people and this subreddit is moderated by a few volunteers with day (and night) jobs. Proposed changes should be both philosophically and practically acceptable and should take into consideration this subreddit’s target audience of medical professionals.

medicine,ECG(s) #7: Experienced interventional cardiologist had no idea what this is. I don't either.,"[All ECGs are here](http://imgur.com/a/X1zDt)

This was a highly functional, independent 90-something year old with a history of HTN, no prior CAD hx who presented with chest pain.  The initial two ECGs are were obtained in the ED minutes apart.  Cardiology took her to the cath lab as a STEMI.

Cath didn't reveal much: a 40-50% mid LAD lesion, 40% tubular ostial third diagonal, 30% tubular OM2, 40% tubular distal RCA, and otherwise some mild irregularities.  No intervention was done and it was thought that it was either coronary spasm or resolved plaque rupture.

The interesting ECGs are her post cath ones (#3 and 4), and specifically look at the rhythm lead.  She was in no pain, hemodynamically completely stable.  I was given a head's up on the patient because I was in house overnight in case she crashed but the interventionist, who is quite experienced with ECGs, said he had never seen this before.  She had an uneventful next day and TTE showed severe AS with valve area of ~0.8 cm^2. Trop peaked at 0.19.

To me it almost looks like a biphasic or triphasic T wave, maybe a weird form of bigeminy.  I've seen plenty of AIVR and I don't think it is this.  What do you guys think?

pharmacy,What did you learn this week?,"Hi all!  
  
My pharmacy has been having some issues with **drugs that must be dispensed in the original container**.  
  
A bottle of **Viread®** got opened when my B tech decided she was going to pour 3 bottles into 1 large bottle. These have a desiccant inside and techs should be trained to just attach the label to the stock bottle.  
  
Curious, I took a look at the **Truvada®** shelf space. Someone had opened a bottle some time ago and left 3 pills inside with no desiccant. This had to be moved to my Damaged &amp; Outdates bin. Shame.  
  
Next, we got a new prescription for **Dexamethasone Intensol™**. This one comes with a calibrated syringe, says that it must be dispensed in the original container, and says to put a 90 day expiration date on it once opened. Unfortunately the bottle on my shelf had been opened and no date recorded. I could not track down any previous prescriptions for it, so this is a bit of a mystery.  
  
Subsequently, it is good to note that **Linzess®** comes in a small bottle that is hard to label. My tech decided to open it up and pour it into an amber vial. This one also says to dispense in original container because it contains a desiccant.  
  
Last but not least, I discovered that someone partial filled a patient's **Treximet®** prescription some time ago. The odd thing was, the Dr had written the prescription for 10 tablets, when it comes in a bottle of 9. Anyway the patient was made aware of what had happened and did not report any negative effects or lack of efficacy. I put a popup note on his profile to remind future pharmacy staff to dispense his headache pills in groups of 9.  
  
I'm sure I learned some other things not related to medication packaging, but this post is getting long anyway and I'll leave it to you. What did **you** learn this week?",50,24,2016-01-11,PHARMA,0.07564868777990341,0.8938207626342773,0.03053058497607708

This paper started with the premise that after business hours admissions had a higher mortality risk. The study showed that non-elective admits are sicker than electives ones and have a higher mortality, however, after multivariable regression the mortality of both groups were the same. Surprisingly the time of the day with the highest mortality was 6am to 11am. Why? difficult to say, maybe sicker post-op kids? or people is to busy rounding and the early morning admits wait more?

""RESULTS:
Data from 234,192 admissions to 99 PICUs from January 2009 to September 2012 were included. When compared with regular weekday admissions, off-hours admissions were less likely to be elective, had a higher risk for mortality by PIM2, and had a higher observed ICU mortality (off-hours 2.7% vs weekdays 2.2%; P &lt; .001). Multivariable regression revealed that, after adjustment for other significant factors, off-hours admission was associated with lower odds of mortality (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.97; P = .004). Post hoc multivariable analysis revealed that admission during the morning period 6:00 am to 10:59 am was independently associated with death (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.39; P &lt; .0001).""",13,34,2016-01-14,PHARMA,0.10030482709407806,0.8682437539100647,0.03145145624876022

medicine,CHF + diarrhea? IVFluids question from med student,"New to the floors and had a question I thought someone on reddit would be kind enough to help me with. Sorry, my attending is not the most caring teacher in the world.

Had a fairly old patient today who has PMH of CHF with low EF (systolic), but not a terrible EF. He came in with:

 ~1 day of diarrhea 
-hadn't eaten/did not drink for about same time
-cracked lips, orthostatic hypotension, subjectively decreased urine output, and a few other signs of mild/moderate hypovolemia. No tachy (but on Beta Blockers) BP: 122/84
- BUN/Cr ~30 with a fairly normal Cr ~1. BUN not this high on last admission several months ago. Cr about the same as previous admissions.
- Kidneys are in pretty good shape from what I can gather
- Na+ and K+ were WNL on BMP, but Na might have been high-normal
- won't eat or drink much due to nausea and weakness
-Normal sized old gentleman about 5' 9"" BMI 20
- some fine rales ""crackles"" b/l in lung bases... seems to be chronic based on his notes
- No SOB or issues with O2 sat

My question is, given CHF, is it okay to put someone like this on resuscitative fluids? And what kind/rate makes sense if he's 80kg or so? How do I know when to stop them and switch to maintenance fluids? Should I even give maintenance fluids? 

My thought process was:
hypovolemic
electrolyte levels pretty dead normal, so no need to give hyper/hypotonic saline or any other lytes

Give 0.9%NS D5W or LR at 120cc/hr. Get a sense for losses from diarrhea and adjust hourly rate of 0.9% NS to maintenance losses + diarrhea +50cc. This probably gives a little too much Na+ but his kidneys should be able to compensate.
Stop it when urine output is 1mL/kg hour? Or orthostatic hypotension improves?
Switch to maintenance fluid until willing to eat/drink pedialyte.

What would be your thought process here? Thanks so much!!!!",14,15,2016-01-16,PHARMA,0.08348462730646133,0.8843128681182861,0.03220250457525253

medicine,Let's have a discussion on healthcare relating to Sanders,"Sanders' health plan is to come out today, but we can pretty confidently know it will propose a universal health care with power given to states. What does this mean for us? In his 2013 plan, Sanders plan proposed that doctors could not charge more than the state set limit (i.e. Medicare rates). 

So what happens to independent insurers? What happens to our autonomy? What about vertical HMOs like Kaiser, how are they to function? If all doctors are required to accept only Medicare rates, how many of us are going to go the route of concierge? 

I worry we will have a future where our average clinician will go from 40-50 patients to 60-70 to stay afloat or become cash only Botox clinic Micky Mouse doctors. 

Comfort me Reddit.

1. What is a better explanation for her ""macrocytosis""? [Hover-over for answer](/s ""This was RBC agglutination, caused by cold agglutinin disease. The RBCs lump together, and are counted by the heme analyzer as a single giant cell. This causes the RBC count to plummet, since multiple cells are counted at once, and the MCV and MCHC to go sky high, since that ""cell"" is abnormally large. The hematocrit is calculated from these values, which explains why it is so abnormal. The hemoglobin, on the other hand, is directly measured, and reflects her true level."")

2. What are possible causes for this finding/condition? [Hover-over for answer](/s ""Cold agglutinin disease may be primary/idiopathic or secondary. Benign causes include Mycoplasma pneumonia infection, mononucleosis, or autoimmune disease. Malignant causes include chronic lyphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma AKA Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, or myeloma."")

medicine,"On a cellular level, I can't make sense of death","Like many people, I have trouble understanding death. Unlike many people, this does not have very much to do with religious or philosophical overtones.

Instead, what I don't understand how there is a moment of death that is instantaneous for the whole organism. What I mean is, there are innumerable injuries that can occur that will and will not kill a person. In some cases, a really severe injury will leave a person with permanent deficits, but not kill them. 

In other cases, a less serious injury will kill someone ""instantly."" It seems to me that at the precise moment of insult, a huge preponderance of the cells in the body are still living. There is a smaller subset that is obliterated, by, e.g. a gunshot wound. But in some cases the gunshot wound will lead to death slowly, in other cases will lead to death instantly, in other cases will lead to paralysis or the creation of neural deficits but will not lead to death.

But what distinguishes whether this process is instantaneous or not?

What has happened to a person with a severe head injury that causes ""total"" death, whereas another person with a severe head injury might live 120 seconds with some deficits before dying ""completely""

Or is it that the distinction is actually more blurred than what is implied above, and in the cases of instantaneous death it is actually loss of consciousness followed rapidly by death?

To put it in a slightly different framework, if the body is composed of living cells that are mutually dependent on one another for life, and life of the organism is an emergent property dependent on the appropriate organization and cooperation of those cells, how can death be defined in terms of the life and death of individual cells?",31,37,2016-01-24,PHARMA,0.14813704788684845,0.8313245177268982,0.02053843066096306
medicine,The toughest thing I do.,"Caring for someone who has given up on caring for herself.  This is not because she has a bad vice that she can't lay down like gluttony, smoking or substance abuse.  And now at the age of 20, she is dying.  She is this way because her mother gave up on her the moment she was born.  She was born with HIV and quickly developed AIDS in a time when prevention is possible and perinatal transmission of HIV can be almost entirely prevented.  She has grown up surrounded by a community that is mistrustful and associates her disease with promiscuity and risky behavior.  Not the reality of the tragedy of her condition.  The fact remains that she should be given more support, not isolated and shunned.  She is terrified those closest to her will find out and betray her like her mother.  She cannot even rely on her family to love her unconditionally.  Imagine growing up like that where your mother shuns you and your community finds you vile and infected.


Enter me, an intern of internal medicine, halfway through my first and toughest year.  I can feel the pull of the jaded, I could just easily write her off as just another Severe Sepsis ICU patients admitted for aggressive life-saving measures and downgrade her when my job is done.  But my soul cries out for her, she needs help - I know this, but I don't know how to reach her.  She is too far gone and I need to go home.  Talking with her more and more I realize just how hopeless it is.  When I read the chart the evidence is damning - she is dying and there is nothing we can do to save her.  She has multi-drug resistant AIDS with a CD4 count of zero and a viral load in the millions.  She says she wants to live, but she also says she has nothing to live for.  And honestly, when I imagine what it’s like to be her, I know I would feel the same way.  The saddest thing is I have already taken care of her once this year on the wards.  Now I meet her again in the ICU sicker than ever before, the prognosis grim.  I want to help her, but treating her disease isn’t the way.  We need to treat her community, our society, and her mother.  She did not choose this, but she is becoming a martyr of a silenced and isolated caste of untouchables.  


We as a society have permitted this by treating AIDS and HIV as taboo.  We must do better.  We have to.


So I will treat her and I will hopefully turn her around and bring her infection under control until the next time.  But knowing how emotionally shattered she is – how awful it is to be living her life.  I know that by treating her and making her “better”.  I send her back to the anguish and cruelty of her brief life, the only one she has ever known.",7,33,2016-01-24,PHARMA,0.11775197088718414,0.8548426032066345,0.027405455708503723

I was in anatomy class and Professor RO was going on about the skull I believe it was (btw one of the nicest professor's I've ever had, elderly fellow, but always brought anatomy alive) and to be honesty I'm not sure how to we ended up on the topic but we got onto the topic of children with autism.

Someone had mentioned something along the lines of ""...autistic child...*something something something*..."" and right away Prof RO stopped them and corrected them by stating something along the lines of ""we don't define anyone by their disease."" Basically stating that if we refer to a person as an autistic child we're essentially saying that the disease comes first and the human second. But that shouldn't be the case. The correct alternative is 'a child with autism'. 

And I get that it's something that stuck with me and it's something so small which we all do, myself included.

medicine,Family life as a doctor,"I've been doing some thinking about where my life is headed after Med school.

When I came into Med school I was sure I wanted to specialise; internal medicine in particular caught my interest because of the variety of cases and the complexity of problems. 

As I've been going through Med school, however, I've become a lot more pessimistic about the future. As interesting and beautiful as medicine is, I simply don't think I can keep up this lifestyle for another few decades.

Somewhere along the way other priorities started taking precedence - I want to eventually get married, have children, and actually slow down enough to enjoy my family life rather than doing it for the sake of it.

From the looks of how Doctors in the hospital work, it's simply not possible to attain any semblance of work life balance to enjoy a family.

The best I can think of now is to do family medicine which hopefully will bring some semblance of reasonable working hours - but I'm worried some day I'll regret not doing something more exciting.

What are your thoughts ?

pharmacy,Keeping technicians accountable,"The pharmacy (independent) I'm at is having some serious issues with technician errors (miscounting medications, pulling wrong medications, labeling errors, etc). Honestly the scary thing is that one of the techs who is causing the issue is a former pharmacist from another country. 

We are trying to work on a system to keep them accountable for their mistakes. Right now we are just trying to figure out who is responsible for the errors so we are thinking of assigning each technician an index card and having them place that card in the bin with the script they worked on, but that's about it for now. 

Just wondering how other pharmacies do this? I have a feeling it may be a bit different in chains but I'd still love to hear your guys' input so that we can work on this.

Yes Narcan saves lives, but should there be stronger caveats about its use by lay people? 

Aside from strong and potentially violent withdrawal reactions, I see the problem of if you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.
