medicine,IamA 40 year plus male who never went through puberty due to a medical condition called Kallmann Syndrome.,"**My short bio:**
I have Kallmann syndrome. It is a rare genetic condition that meant I did not go through puberty. I also do not have a sense of smell. After years of being dismissed as ""late developer"" or ""late bloomer"" I was not correctly diagnosed until I was 23.

Since I lack any testicular development I need to be on life long testosterone replacement therapy to give me normal male testosterone levels.

I am currently on another form of treatment, called gonadotropin therapy which should induce fertility.

I talk to a lot of fellow patients on-line and in person and I keep in touch with medical experts in this condition so I can try to help other people with it.

Late diagnosis is very common and we are often dismissed as late developers or late bloomers. The condition affects both men and women and has an incidence of around 1 in 50,000.

I am always happy to talk to other people about my condition.

medicine,Psychiatrists and neurologists of meddit: biggest misconceptions about your specialties,"Hi! I'm a US med student that will be making my 4th (final) year schedule in a few months, and although I've been drawn to each and every specialty during my 3rd year rotations, I'm terribly, terribly interested in the human brain. I might be putting a schedule together to direct myself to one of those specialties, so I've done a lot of reading and 'soul-searching,' but I'd also like to get a sense of what psychiatrists and neurologists RIGHT NOW think about their specialties.


Specifically, I'd like to know what 'bullshit' people might be telling me in the near future about the specialties so I can look out for it, if I do decide to go in one of those two directions. **What are the biggest misconceptions about your specialty, and what is the truth?**


If you have **any advice to give** regarding current and future trends for your specialty (especially if it gets me excited about it), that would be appreciated, as well!


Thanks!

medicine,Operating on terminal patients when the risks are high,"Sometimes a patient is terminal because the patient is inoperable. I have a few questions regarding this;

1: Does inoperable sometimes mean that the risks dont outweigh the benefits? 

2: If true then who decides this? And can the patient appeal?

3: Hypothetically, if a patient has roughly 6 weeks to live without surgery, and the surgery has a 99% mortality rate and a 1% chance of extending the patients lifespan by a mean of 5 years. Is this patient considered inoperable and thus terminal?

4: Are there guidelines and thresholds to decide when a patient is inoperable?

5: Are there surgians that specialize in operating unoperable patients?

I have a incurable muscle wasting disorder called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. It's a rapidly progressive disease and 100% fatal. 1 in 3500 male children are born with it. People suffering from this disorder lose the ability to run, walk, and move. Breathing becomes extremely difficult and most will lose their lives due to respiratory failure. All become dependent on ventilators, and still die in their 20s and 30s from heart failure.

Time is running out, for me, for all of my fellow sufferers. If ever there was a glimmer of hope, the time is now. Recent advances in an experimental exon skipping drug, Eteplirsen, have shown signs of slowing muscle degeneration. This drug has shown no serious side effects, but the FDA is dragging their feet.

pharmacy,Why would you use Narcan for a non overdose situation?,"I'm a bit confused about the following situation.

A 58 year old woman has been in the ICU for a week and she came in with sepsis, pancreatitis, colitis, and a handful of other issues. Her hemoglobin had been dropping over the last few days so they decided to do a colonoscopy. During the colonoscopy, her breathing dropped and her sats went into the 80s. They were about to intubate, but instead the doctor gave Narcan and the patient came back and they quit the procedure. The only medication given was propofol. 

Now, it was my understanding that Narcan is used to reverse opioid overdose by blocking the μ-opioid receptors. So I am a bit confused on why the doctor thought it was a good idea. I have a few scenarios but I don't know which is the most likely.


* Did he think the sedation for the colonoscopy might have been too much and he used Narcan to combat that?

* Or can it be used to treat respiratory depression, even without opiate use?

I know for a fact the reason isn't a suspicion of actual opiate misuse.

Any thoughts on those? Or am I missing another indication?",20,13,2014-03-07,PHARMA,0.1457310914993286,0.8232442140579224,0.031024718657135963

Pharmacist: ?, I never even told you guys what the second drug in the interaction is.

Nurse: I asked the doctor if anything he takes interacts with diazepam and he said no.

Pharmacist: I patient sees 3 doctors. I highly doubt you guys even know what all he takes. And yes there certainly is an interaction.

Nurse: Whatever, I asked the doctor and he said go ahead with diazepam.

Pharmacist:  I guess I don't understand why you are so defensive here. The patient has never used diazepam before and it interacts. He has taken lorazepam, it works for him, and it avoids the interaction. It seems an obvious choice.

Nurse: I already asked and the doctor wants to go ahead with the diazepam.

Pharmacist: Tell you what how about I ask the patient which one he wants.

Nurse: You can't do that!!!

Pharmacist: I can't change the prescription but I can certainly tell the patient that better alternatives exist. Then you can have a conversation with the patient over what the best medication is in this case since you appear to be unwilling to have that conversation with me.

Nurse: (in a voice that remained me of a three year old that didn't get their way) Fine! I'll ask the doctor if we can change it to lorazepam. *very loud hang up*

medicine,Choosing a specialty - practical considerations versus idealism,"Hey Meddit, I'm a second year medical student and I've come to the seemingly unavoidable conclusion that every specialty will be squeezed out of existence before I apply in a year and a half!

Excuse my sensationalism; allow me to explain. I've been involved with organized medicine quite a bit since I started medical school, which has made me much more aware of the political realities surrounding each specialty. For example, in California, doctors fight round after round of scope of practice battles and we lose as many as we ""win"" (meaning we've succeeded only in maintaining the status quo). For example, anesthesiologists have ceded some ground to a startlingly effective cRNA lobby, physical therapists can now diagnose and treat MSK conditions for a certain length of time, etc etc. Other specialties have other problems besides midlevels - pathologists face major consolidation of their practices from national labs, and radiologists face a massive graduating resident oversupply.

Now obviously I can't be worrying about the political prospects of multiple specialties; I'm an MS2 for chrissakes. However, I don't think anyone would disagree with me that it should factor into my decision somewhat - many people further on in their training have let me know that they wish they had been more aware of the practical considerations of their practice in medical school.

So, residents and doctors of Meddit, what do you suppose is the ideal balance? Should I choose a specialty that I'd love doing, even while knowing that it may be facing massive upheavals in their practice in the future? How do *you* continue to work knowing that certain stakes in the political/organizational game are stacked against you?

medicine,Engineer in Training looking to switch fields and into Gene Therapy/Engineering,"Hello redditors,

I recently graduated Materials Engineering a year ago, and am currently working at an engineering firm that does service work.

Anyways, I have always been very interested in medicine, and it was a close decision between engineering and medicine for me. At the end, I stuck with engineering. 

However, I still have a very strong passion for medicine and I would like to explore that side of me. I would like to know that considering my B.Sc in Engineering, what masters program in biology could I be doing through which I could directly contribute to Gene Therpay/Engineering? I am also great with programming, so something like Molecular simulations could also be possible. (In fact I am currently trying to simulate the interactions of a few molecules on my own time). 

As well, if there are any books that could be suggested, that would be great. This way I can read more about gene therapy/engineering.

Thanks Redditors.

It's for my daughters pending Cranial Vault Reconstruction/pressure probe placement. There seems to be miscommunication between two doctors and I'd love to get a message to him. 

I've called his office three times in the last 2 weeks, so I'm not being overly annoying to them, but at the same time this whole ""this surgeon's waiting on that surgeon, and that surgeon is waiting on this surgeon"" needs to be straitened out. 

The receptionist is VERY short with me. Today I didn't even ask for anything other than a call back from the nurse she won't even get a message through to him, OR a timeline (even a ""I'll call you back in 2 weeks"" would have been cool) 

So, of course, as a patient, I'm frustrated, but that makes me wonder how do you as doctors feel when you hear your receptionists do this? Is it her place to withhold messages to the doctor?

I always got work a district of ours furthest away from the school.  Never in 4 years did I even come close to getting caught.  Until now.  

At least I get to stay in school and graduate, however, the price for that benefit is the *Powers That Be* will ""give a full update"" to where I matched, and let them know about my ""extra and obviously beneficial clinical experience"".  

Meaning because I never mentioned I have an additional 4 years experience as a paramedic during interviews, I'm fucked.  It's still up in the air whether I will add a nice little violation to my resume, however, either way, I'm fucked.  

At least no one in my school knows.  I can graduate sans public humiliation.",55,18,2014-03-19,PHARMA,0.0712948739528656,0.891905665397644,0.03679947927594185

I put together a few medical education resources for interns and junior medical staff at my shop, one of which is a little pocket-guide (available (here)[http://jakebarlow.me/gray-matter/pockethmo/] if you're interested).

I'm looking at adding a section on referrals, divided by specialty. The target audience is interns/junior HMOs referring to registrars (that's residents for those of you in the US). As you can see from the link, it should be concise and focused, and is more of a cognitive tool than a reference text.

It would be great if any of you who regularly take referrals could provide a list of the key pieces of information you want to know over the phone. I recognise this will vary depending on the CC, but I still think this could be useful for JMS to make sure they have the key pieces of info before they pick up the phone.

medicine,Best strategy for switching residency programs (anesthesiology)?,"Hi /r/medicine, 

I'm wondering what the options are and what the best strategy is for transferring residency programs, particularly in anesthesiology.

**Back Story:** I couples matched this year, and while we both got top programs and are very excited about the programs we landed in, unfortunately we're not in the same city.  This was a calculated risk given by how made our joint rank lists, but it is obviously less than ideal.  I matched in a surgical sub which will obviously be very difficult to transfer in, but my SO matched in anesthesiology and it seems like there are generally more options to move around given the larger size of the programs.  

My SO was an extremely competitive applicant (255+ step 1, good grades, no red flags) and matched into a categorical position.  We both agree that my SO would get outstanding training at the institution at which they matched, but we really don't want to be apart that much over the next four years.  With that said, here are my questions:

* will the intern year at a categorical program count in terms of completing a PGY-I year and permitting my SO to apply to the few advanced spots available in my city?  *I.e.,* will they be eligible to apply through the match for the physician track for advanced positions this fall?
* How feasible is it to transfer programs outside of the match, either now or anytime in the future?
* What is the best strategy for getting LORs from my SO's current program?  Obviously no program wants to lose a resident, so how does one go about getting support from their program to transfer without tanking their future career?
* Are there any options apart from taking a year off or not doing medicine that we're missing?

Thanks in advance for all help!

**tl;dr:** couples matched into good programs but not together, looking into best options for one of us transferring so we're not apart for four years.",13,18,2014-03-22,PHARMA,0.023725027218461037,0.9159947037696838,0.06028022989630699

medicine,For the love of all that is holy... be careful with needles/sharps.,"Yeah, so I'm not happy with life right now. Recently matched into the specialty of my choice (anesthesiology) and the location of my choice. I'm truly really lucky. But, here's how quickly happiness can turn to sadness.



We were starting a new art line in the ICU on a relatively stable patient. Cuz there was questions about the old one bla bla bla. So, I palpate the pulse and the M3 asked if they could do it. I was once in her shoes, so I of course said yeah, but the resident supervising needed to say yes. We look up, and the resident is cool with it.



So I show her how to palpate for the pulse, how to hold the A-line needle. Then the resident stops us and says, wait, let's use the ultrasound. Grabs the ultrasound. I push the wrist in a little more extension. We find the radial artery. All is good. M3 begins to place the a-line. She misses. The resident asks her to come back to the skin without removing the needle and try again. She removes the needle and is busy looking at the ultrasound instead of the effing needle and she pierces my glove and nicks the skin on my left hand. 



Best part? Patient is admitted for respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Patient has a history of IVDU. They haven't confirmed HIV yet... 



So, to wrap up my final rotation of 4th year... I spent it with the occ health nurse taking my blood and then I got post-exposure prophylaxis because of the risk factors of the patient. Here's to taking my Combivir for the next little while.

pharmacy,My friend reacts to someone complaining about waiting on medicine.,"Someone said, ""Why does it take so long to put a few pills in bottles? You make us wait on purpose so I am forced to buy stuff.
Her reaction it's worth the read.
---""Say you want those 30 pills covered by insurance. There are five people that have just dropped off multiple prescriptions each, and want them NOW or 5 minutes ago, or yesterday as if it's funny. You say you have filled here before, and we have your card on file, but you haven't and it's not and you've already walked away. We call your alternate pharmacy to get the info from your card. We create a new profile for you, and there's a new senior employee who is the opposite of computer savvy and struggling. Meanwhile, you're on hold with the insurance company, because the correct information is not even close to what is on the actual card. We verify our information and your name and information to 3 different agents before hanging up in frustration. Your next customer wants their kid's medicine flavored, and we have to stop working on yours, because the kid is crying as loud as they can, so you mix 3 individual bottles by hand to get them out of the store as fast as humanly possible before developing a migraine. The next customer wants to buy a basket full of groceries while a line forms behind them. Going back to you, we then notice the doctor had not written the directions correctly, so we have to call the doctors office to clarify but they are on lunch so we are at their mercy until they call back with the correct directions. Pharmacist verifies everything about your Rx is FLAWLESS, while answering random questions, giving advice and leaving the pharmacy to show someone where the vitamins are (the aisle that says VITAMINS) Rx is then counted and verified again. The drive through goes off and you have a convoy of people who call the store from outside the building to find out what the hold up is. The phone never stops ringing. A new person walks up and makes you check the prices on 6 different medications, then says they are cheaper at walmart and walk away, oblivious to the time they have just wasted. You come back to pick up your prescription, we need five more minutes and we are angrily glared at from all sides like we're  fish in an aquarium. We go to check you out, you pay, we complete transaction and say have a nice day. And then you mention you have a coupon card for said drug and we die a little inside. Everything has to be rebilled again and verified again. THAT is why it takes ""so long"" to ""put 30 pills in a bottle."" Just because there is no one standing in line does not mean we are just standing around doing nothing. These are just some of the real situations that happen every day. We understand you don't feel well, and neither so we, but we must smile while you talk into your cell phone, barely making eye contact, as if we aren't members of the same society. Please Please...don't take pharmacy employees for granted. Be patient. When we say thirty minutes, it's not because there's some sort of conspiracy to force you to open your wallet, it's because we need thirty minutes. Oh, and pharmacists make so much because they spend 6 years gaining the knowledge to make sure your laundry list of meds don't interact with each other and kill you. But, if none of that bothers you, I can close my eyes and throw 30 random pills in a bottle for you, without caring or knowing if it's right or not. /rant.""",50,45,2014-03-30,PHARMA,0.06842302531003952,0.9051521420478821,0.026424773037433624

&gt;I recently was at the Scientific Assembly of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) in San Diego, giving a lecture to a large audience of Academy members on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. I mentioned why I thought identifying the RSV virus was important. I stated that if you tell the family the infant has RSV and that there is the expectation that cough will last 1-2 months, this may forestall them going to the ER or urgent care center. In those assembly lines of healthcare, they will be told that their child has ""bronchitis"" and will receive the inevitable azithromycin script. This will make the parents happy, free the healthcare provider of the need for further explanations, and result in a satisfying visit for the administrators of that facility. The trouble, of course, is that an antibiotic has again been used to treat a self-limited viral infection.

&gt;A physician came up to me afterwards and agreed with me but said that he had no choice. He works in one of those venues and is subject to surveys to measure ""quality."" For him, quality is measured in 2 ways: The first is by getting the patient door-to-door in 45 minutes, and the second is by a Press Ganey survey to see if the patient was happy. Because of these measures, he is forced to abandon his role as a responsible steward of antibiotic use to keep his job and get a bonus.

&gt;Another physician in the audience told the crowd that he was able to increase his satisfaction score by 7% simply by prescribing an antibiotic to all patients who call with a complaint of cough, sore throat, or sinus headache. One doctor reported to the media that he had to give Dilaudid® for minor pain because his Press Ganey score was low the previous month.

&gt;I believe that this little-known company, Press Ganey, from South Bend, Indiana, has become a bigger threat to the practice of good medicine than trial lawyers. They are the leading provider of patient satisfaction surveys for hospitals and physicians. For the past decade, the government and healthcare administrators have embraced the ""patient is always right"" model and will punish providers that fail to rate well in these surveys. Press Ganey's CEO, Patrick Ryan, said, ""Nobody wants to be evaluated; it's a tough thing to see a bad score, but when I meet with physician groups I tell them the train has left the station. Measurement is going to occur.""[1] Obamacare has budgeted $850 million in reduced Medicare reimbursement for hospitals with lower scores.

&gt;The mandate is simple: Never deny a request for an antibiotic, an opioid pain medication, a scan, or an admission. One emergency room with poor survey scores started offering hydrocodone ""goody bags"" to discharged patients in order to improve their ratings. And doctors face the reality that uncomfortable discussions on behavioral topics -- say, smoking or obesity -- come with the risk of a pay cut. If you tell a patient that their knee pain is related to weight, that their smoking is worsening their child's asthma, or that they can't lose weight because of French fries and not a glandular problem, your ratings and pay will take a hit.

&gt;Satisfied patients are not healthy patients. In a paper published in 2012, researchers at the University of California, Davis, using data from nearly 52,000 adults, found that the most satisfied patients spent the most on healthcare and prescription drugs.[2] They were 12% more likely to be admitted to the hospital and accounted for 9% more in total healthcare costs. Strikingly, they were also the ones more likely to die.

&gt;Overtreatment is a silent killer. We can overtreat and overprescribe. The patients will be happy, give us good ratings, yet be worse off. We must have the ability to deny treatment for a patient's own good. Patients aren't the best judge of what is best for them. Several years ago, an elderly female patient wanted me to write a prescription for tamsulosin because she got a coupon in the mail. It did not matter that she lacked a prostate.

&gt;We should try to be kind to our patients and take time to understand them, but we must resist these misguided pressures and do the right thing. Sometimes patients have to be told ""no,"" and the leadership in healthcare must understand this. Take heart in the words of Mark Twain: ""Always do what is right. It will gratify half of mankind and astound the other.""",57,148,2014-03-31,PHARMA,0.053285205736756325,0.8851956427097321,0.06151914596557617
