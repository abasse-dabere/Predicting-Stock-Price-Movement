Health,"Meditation newbie question: When meditating, previously scrambled thoughts become clear, making me want to think about the topic instead of ""unfocusing"" ...","This doesn't happen all the time, but there can be stretches of days when it happens consistently: I'm a few minutes into meditating, when suddenly, a problem or issue that I had been thinking about snaps into focus -- scrambled thoughts about it fall into place, and even if I don't come to a solution, the problem seems less complicated, a solution closer at hand.

That, in itself, is a good thing, but it makes me want to pursue whatever line of thinking I've come across instead of trying to calm my mind, save the problem-solving for later, and get deeper into my meditative state.

I am, I think, afraid of forgetting the solution or idea I seem closer to reaching (which is a legitimate concern at my age -- mid-40s). 

Do you know of a trick for putting aside such thoughts or concerns -- I mean, should I just train myself to STOP thinking, or should I try, say, keeping a notepad handy to scribble down these thoughts?

Then again, I fear note-taking would take on a life of its own, and pretty soon I'd be brainstorming instead of meditating. 

I'm sure every meditator needs to come up with an approach suited to his or her needs, but at the same time I would very much appreciate hearing lessons learned by those who are farther down the path.

Health,Do you think Plastic Surgeons have an ethical responsibility to consider if their patient has Body Dysmorphic Disorder?,"I'm taking an abnormal psych class and we were learning about [body dysmorphic disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder), which is a psychological disorder where the person is convinced that they are ugly/have a flaw and fixate on it to the point where they become consumed by it. There are many behaviours associated with it, one of them being [obsession with plastic surgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder#Compulsive_behaviors).

Plastic surgeons are more likely to run into people with BDD and an individual may look like they are ""addicted"" to plastic surgery, constantly wanting to ""fix flaws"" they see in themselves.

Health,Health: How dangerous/unhealthy is liposuction?,"As a reasonably healthy and athletic young male I am considering the option of liposuction on my lower abdomen. I'm about 5'9-10 and 190ish pounds with a reasonable amount of muscle. I stay pretty active and hit the gym when my work schedules allows, playing games outside in my free time. My reasoning for lipo is:

A) I can afford it.
B) I am young and without any medical conditions so I should be able to recover quickly from any surgery.
C) I've been reading that its the only effective way to actually remove the fat cells in that area instead of just shrinking them via working out.

Is this a horrible idea or is lipo relatively safe these days if I go to a plastic surgeon of reasonable quality?

I can taste it and there's a film that coats my mouth, even after only an hour or two nap. It only happens when I sleep, and my breath is fine until the next time I sleep. 

I've tried everything a normal person would try; I brush, mouthwash and floss twice a day (morning and before bed) and have a tongue scraper I use at night. Nothing. I also have tonsil stones if that's any help--

Has anyone dealt with terrible morning breath and actually been successful in defeating it? I am curious as to products like Akitvoxigen but I refuse to pay the price with only the hope that they actually work. Like I said, it's never a problem except for when I wake up, and the bad breath is gone once I brush my teeth until the next time I fall asleep.

Any help or suggestions are most definitely appreciated. My dentist hasn't been much help!

Ever since I've been the age to get acne, I've been obsessive over my appearance (my acne has been very very mild according to parents and doctors, I felt like it was bad though).  Over the years I would try medicine, after medicine, after medicine.  I've been to way too many dermatology appointments, getting pimples injected with a steroid that makes them go away faster, handed in way too many different medicines and creams, (I'm better now) but I used to stare in the mirror and just look at myself and feel horrible.  I finally went on Accutane and I'm on my 4th or 5h month, so near the end.  I have no active acne, but as of late i've been constantly complaining about spots that were left over as a result of having some acne, just thinking i'm overall ugly.

I've mentioned this to my therapist before and he says I don't have it, but.. it seems like this has all been behavior of someone who has.
