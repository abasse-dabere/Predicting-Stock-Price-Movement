Health,The government admits fluoride added to drinking water contains radioactive elements and heavy metals including lead.,"What does our government’s National Toxicology Program have to say about toxic fluoride waste?

“The manufacture of phosphate fertilizer in Central Florida releases not only fluorides as a toxic pollutant but also radionuclides. Radium wastes come from the filtration systems. Uranium and its decay-rate products are found in the phosphate rock and fertilizer as well as the byproduct fluorosilicic acid. During the wet-process procedure, trace amounts of both radium and uranium are captured in the scrubbers and therefore are in the fluorosilicic acid. During the acidulation process yielding phosphoric acid, radon gas in the phosphate pebbles can be released and carried into the fluorosilicic acid, while polonium can be captured during the scrubbing process and then can combine with fluoride.” Page7

They also state in the same publication that fluorosilicic acid is produced mainly as a byproduct of phosphate fertilizer manufacturing and that it is used in water fluoridation either directly or as the sodium salt. Page 5

A typical product contains 59.34% fluorine and a maximum of 0.50% each of moisture as water, water-insoluble matter, and heavy metals (as lead). Page 4

They also state that the amount of contamination in the water is so miniscule that there is basically no ill health effect. ""In addition, exposure to impurities in the fluoridating agent is judged to be of low health risk when properly treated water is ingested."" Page 8

Regardless of how small the amounts of impurities are, they are in there. Then you also have to consider how toxic fluoride itself is to the body.

Health,I just found out my preliminary HIV test came back positive.,"I have been sick with other stuff for the last 10 years (since I was 14) and today I just found out the preliminary test came back positive.

I have a rare immune disorder called Ankylosing Spondylitits already so now I'm not sure how that is going to play into this.

I am just so scared and have no idea what I'm going to do. Thankfully this is just a prelim test and it's possible of a false positive because my immune system will just attack anything in sight.

This all started because I had sex with a guy that took off his condom and fucked me when I told him only to use condoms.

**EDIT:** Hey guys/ gals ^.^ Great news first. I just got my 2nd confirmation test back and it came back negative. Secondly, I apologize for not responding. I've still been sick and because I couldn't use my meds I descended into severe degenerative arthritic pain. It got so bad I was confined to my bed for the past week (during finals too O.O). I was originally supposed to get my confirmation back a lot sooner, but the new clinic that I went to lost it. Which meant I had to redo the confirmation. 

I learned a lot from this experience and I can't thank you'll enough for the well wishes and replies. And I want to say for anyone out there who had to go through finding out you're positive for HIV ** hugs **.

medicine,How much should one take lifestyle into account when choosing a specialty?,"I'm going to be at a US medical school next year and when I mention this to the doctors I know they seem to give me pretty different advice regarding what path to take in medicine. 

A few of the doctors have told me to pick the specialty I love the most no matter what (I'm married, and one of them even told me ""You can always divorce your wife, but not your specialty."") Even though these doctors take call frequently and have little time for anything other than their job, they seem to be very happy and love what they do.

On the other hand, others have told me to definitely prioritize the lifestyle. For example, a radiologist told me that in medical school he was really passionate about surgery but decided to instead do radiology (a specialty he had liked, but not loved) because he wanted to be able to have a lot of time with his family. He still thinks that surgery is awesome, but he is very happy that he picked radiology and that his friends who went into surgery are much busier and stressed.

Another doctor I talked to decided to specialize in critical care and ultimately quit altogether (despite loving the work) to work in hospital administration because she wanted to spend more time with her family.

I know that I shouldn't focus too much on which specialty I'm going to do at this point and I plan on waiting to see what I like in 3rd year before really committing to any one thing.

However, I am concerned with the attitude that I should have towards lifestyle as I think about future specialties. Should I just look for what I enjoy doing the most and then do that? Or should I see which specialty I find most interesting of the handful that are known to have relaxed lifestyles?

I think this is also complicated by the fact that medicine is changing a lot (from work hour limits to reimbursement) and it may be difficult to predict what any one specialty will look like in the future.",14,12,2011-12-04,PHARMA,0.06151926517486572,0.9084894061088562,0.02999134548008442

Health,"Always ask a new doctor if they bill as a hospital or an office when you make your appointment, or you may be out $500 deductible (with insurance) for a physical.","After having pretty reasonable doctor's visits my whole life, I had a surprise bill arrive after moving and getting a new doctor.  I made an appointment to establish care (get your basic physical and cholesterol done) with my closest PCP that was on my insurance provider's (BCBS) website to establish care, which turned out to be at a ""medical center"".  Three months after my appointment I got a bill for nearly $500.  It turns out that because my doctor (resident) was in a medical center, they billed it as an outpatient hospital visit instead of an office visit, which (depending on your insurance) gets subjected to your annual deductible.

My insurance and my insurance agent have told me that they shouldn't be doing this, but I can only get it fixed by contacting the doctor's office, and I've been slowly nagging my way up the supervisor chain with the doctor's billing department.  Regardless:

Always ask what they bill the charges as when you make the appointment.

Update: After escalating this far up enough the chain I finally got them to agree to rebill it.  Where it goes from there is anyone's guess, but it's nice to at least see some effort.

Health,I've been feeling really weird the past few days and it's starting to scare me,"First of all I'm 20 years old, female, and have always been relatively healthy.

I've been feeling so...weird the past couple of days.  I don't know how else to describe it really. I'll try my best to explain:

On Saturday afternoon (it is currently Tuesday night) I started feeling strange but only for a few seconds at a time.  I would get very brief waves of light headedness and my heart would beat rapidly.  It only happened a couple of times and I figured it was a result of being hungover.  I assumed it would just go away after a good night's sleep.  The thing is it continued the next day and has become slightly worse ever since then.  It's absolutely awful at night.  I keep waking up with this feeling of fear and anxiety.   I guess the closest thing I can compare it to is a panic attack, but the thing is, it's all physical.  I have absolutely no reason to be mentally anxious or stressed (other than this strange health issue).  These ""panic attacks"" are extremely brief but they cause the sensation of my chest constricting (no pain, just constriction) my heart beats rapidly and it becomes difficult to breathe for a few seconds.  Then it goes away for a little while.  I'm also finding it difficult to concentrate.  These feelings have only happened once before and they were the result of drinking WAYYY too much coffee in a very short period of time - the caffeine overload led to the first and only panic attack I've ever had up until now.  I have not had a single cup of coffee since Saturday in the hopes that I would start feeling better but nothing has changed.  

I'm starting to get really scared.  I feel very weak yet at the same time I constantly feel the need to move my limbs, similar to restless leg syndrome.  I'm so tired but terrified to try to fall asleep because that's when the sensations are the worst.  I'm asking here because I don't know if this is a physical problem (low blood-sugar? anemia?) or a mental/emotional one that's manifesting physically (anxiety?).  I've experienced some anxiety in the past but I've always been able to take my mind off of it by hanging out with friends or listening to music, but this is not something I can take my mind off of.  Like I said, I have no reason to be anxious or stressed - my life is great right now!  well, other than this little problem...

Edit: Thanks for all of your help guys!  I'm definitely going straight to the health center before class tomorrow.  I think I'll finally try to get some sleep now.  Wish me luck :/

Edit: Here's an update if anyone is interested! Early this morning I got up and went to my school's health center experiencing all the same symptoms.  A few different people took my BP and were a bit concerned with how high it was, though I expected it to be high because I was so anxious.  Somehow my heart rate was normal though.  The nurse prescribed me some Propranolol to reduce BP.  They were worried it might be a thyroid problem so I was sent to the hospital to have my blood drawn.  The blood results came back and they were all clean: thyroid is normal, liver is normal and kidneys are normal.  I guess this made me feel better but I was still feeling super anxious so they prescribed me some Lorazepam to help me relax so that I can actually sleep at night.  Basically everyone just assumed it was severe anxiety, but that's extremely unusual for me.  Anyway, I'm going back tomorrow for a little check up.  Just hoping I feel better by then!",29,24,2011-12-07,PHARMA,0.1849702149629593,0.7805806398391724,0.034449148923158646

Health,The back of my neck starts burning when I turn my head..,"It started last year. During a volleyball game, I turned my head awkwardly to the left and all of a sudden I felt this.. pulling on the muscle on the left side of the back of my neck and I couldn't move for a second out of shock. The left half of my tongue went numb for about 30 seconds and my neck began to tingle and burn insanely. It was so painful I was in tears. It felt like the muscle or tendon or whatever it is was going to tear apart and I was afraid to move my head so I just slowly sank to the floor and sat there crying in the middle of the game. It used to happen rarely. Maybe once every 5 months at most. 
It happened again last month except it was a lot worse. I was shaking my hair after getting out of the shower and I heard it this time. It sounded like you were cracking a knuckle but more dull and muffled. Instantly the same symptoms occurred except ten-fold. The burning pain continued into the next morning.

After that, this has been happening at least twice a week if not more. It now happens with the simplest turn of my head to the left and I've begun to fear turning my head. It's usually always to the left but today it happened in class when I turned to my right to glance at the clock. It wasn't as intense, but still very painful. It's as if the left side of the back of your neck is on fire from where your neck meets your shoulder up to the point where your neck meets your skull... I don't know how else to explain it. It happened again within the hour.

It feels like something is in the way of the muscle/tendon or whatever it is. Like something getting stuck and suddenly being freed. I can't think of any better examples except this: Pulling an elastic band with your finger and having it slip from your finger like when you hit your friends with an elastic and they get mad at you and make you endure the same treatment or they won't give you some of their lunch.

It happened just before I posted this as well while I was showering. I'm really starting to get panicky because it's beginning to occur more often and with the slightest turn of my head. Please help. I appreciate the time you took to read this.

medicine,Need honest opinions. Am I wasting my time applying to med school?,"I know, ""it's not a waste of time if it's what you want"", and ""you'll never know until you try"" but I'm just looking for some advice from an objective source. First off, I'm only applying to Osteopathic schools, I may be naive but I'm not delusional. I am 28 years old, I graduated in 2005 with a BA in Psychology and then continued for a 5th year full time to finish my premed requirements. Took Ochem, Physics, Calculus and Cell Bio concurrently. My 5th year was a travesty (All Cs) and my GPA tanked... my undergrad science and cumulative are both about 2.5. No extenuating circumstances, I was simply unmotivated and although I had an interest in medicine, it was vague and I could never articulate why I had it. In 2006 I moved home and began working full time as an EMT for a 911 heavy commercial service. Fast forward 5 years and here I am with thousands of patient contacts, invaluable experiences, and a passion for medicine and science that literally keeps me up at night. I am obsessed with adding to and perfecting my assessment skills. I have experienced first hand the healing that we can provide from just *listening* and talking to a patient like an equal human being, and truly see medicine as a holistic art. The osteopathic philosophy just makes sense to me. But I digest... 

In January of 2010 I took the MCATs after reteaching myself the basic sciences I never committed to as an undergrad, and scored a 30P (9PS, 10BS, 11VR). When I began preparing for the MCATs my intention was to apply to Caribbean schools, knowing my chances at anything in the US would be basically nonexistant. After countless hours of research I want nothing to do with the Caribbean, mainly due to the increasingly competitive residency situation and how much worse it will be five years from now for Caribbean grads. Since the MCATs I have been taking undergrad science courses and building up a better GPA. I have 20 credits at a 4.0 now (A+P, micro, biochem, genetics). Unfortunately, after 5 full time years and ~160 credits as a lazy undergrad, that GPA is not budging. I think I've raised it one tenth of a GPA point. As I still work 50-60 hours a week (yay student loans) I can only realistically take 1-2 classes a semester, so establishing a post-bacc GPA with a decent amount of credits will take years. The thought of being well into my 30s before I even begin med school is... defeating, to put it mildly. I just want to be talking to and treating patients in ways I cannot now as an EMT. What is even more frustrating is that I know through and through I can excel in med school and that I will make an outstanding, compassionate doctor yet on paper I am a bottom of the barrel candidate. All I need is a chance to interview to show what an application cannot, but I feel like my GPA will preclude even that. I've researched post-bacc programs and it seems like most want applicants who have barely any prereqs completed and have not sat for the MCAT already.

So, am I kidding myself by applying now? Any advice on where to go from here?

Health,Rectal Bleeding...How urgent?,"So this is way too much information, but here we go. I am 22F, and Thursday I started noticing blood after a BM. I have had little bits of blood on the toilet paper before, but this time there was a lot more. It is bright red, and drips into the toilet. It isn't mixed in with the stool, but on the sides of it.  I think it has gotten a little worse since then, to the point where a lot of the water is red. When I wipe it is bright red and not very thick, kind of watery.  I haven't been very constipated or anything, maybe a little on and off but nothing out of the ordinary.  
  
My diet was terrible leading up to it, I was drinking an energy drink or 2 every day and no fruits/veggies. Since it started I have been very healthy with eating, but if it is a diet issue I'm not sure how long it would take to change.  
  
So, obviously I need to see a doctor, but right now I'm out of state on vacation for a week (returning home the 18th).  I don't have a doctor here, and it could be harder to find a hospital my insurance covers than normal. I'm staying with a best guy friend who I am sort of seeing.  
    
So what do I do? Sound the alarm bells and tell my friend to take me to a hospital? Wait it out for a week and then try to face the embarrassment of talking to my parents about it?  I have no general physician, sort of in the in between phase between pediatrician and getting a doctor once I start my new job and move far away from home.

pharmacy,24 hour allergy medication vs 12 hour,"I have pretty chronic allergy problems and I have to take Claritin D fairly frequently otherwise I'm miserable.  I normally take the 24 hour dosage but on a recent doctor's visit she told me I should take the 12 hour, said that the 24 hour doesn't really go the 24 hours and delivers too much medicine right off the bat and not enough for the other half of the day.  
Okay, that sounds like it might be legit.  So now I'm wondering if I can still buy the 24 hour dosage and cut the pill in half instead of buying the 12 hour since it is way cheaper to do it that way?  Is there any reason I shouldn't do it that way?

Health,Jaw getting progressively worse.,"So about two months ago I noticed that my jaw started to pop when I was chewing food.  After searching around it looked like it wasn't anything to be worried about.  It was pretty much unnoticeable unless I was trying to pick it out.  

Fast forward a month or so and the popping started to get worse.  Eventually I started to wake up with my jaw stuck.  I could fix this by simply massaging my jaw and neck and chewing some gum.  It was annoying but it only took a couple minutes to get my jaw popped back open.  I was getting a bit concerned at this point.  

Fast forward to now, and my jaw has been stuck for about two weeks now.  It's really frustrating not being able to eat anything thicker than my pinky finger.  It's sore almost all the time.  It's actually starting to affect my daily life to the point where I can't kiss my girlfriend :(

I currently don't have the funds or insurance to visit the doctor and I'm unemployed so I'm not sure what to do about this.  

Sometimes I get lucky in the morning and my jaw will be open and allow me to move it around freely.  Eventually though it will get itself stuck again.  

I've searched around and haven't found a definitive answer to my issue, just a bunch of people with a similar problem but nothing to this extent.

Health,Should I take her to the ER?,"This is regarding my step-daughter who is 20 months old. The father has no legal rights or custody and rarely gets to see her. It is a pending court issue. 

A timeline:

**October 28**- Toddler has a mild diaper rash

**November 3**- The ex calls asking for money for diaper rash cream of $18. He gives it to the ex (Nov7 the ex says she never took the toddler to the doctor and that she called for it over the phone)

**November 7**-The ex brings the toddler to the ER for the diaper rash after her doctor tells her to, the ex asks for money for the medicine which is $104.  (we don't have it) They take cultures at this time I think

**November 16**-We get the toddler for a few hours and when the toddler dropped her off, the ex squeezed the puss out of a boil that had formed from the diaper rash.

**November 18**-The cultures came back to say the toddler has MRSA(google it if you don't know :P) We have her for the weekend. The ex had to borrow money from the church to cover the medicine which was $126. It's a week's worth.

**Today**-We haven't seen the toddler much since the weekend of November 18 and not enough to check the condition of her MRSA. However the father's father babysits (not as much anymore since the ex quit her job) and said the toddler now has a rash that goes all the way down to her thigh that she itches at profusely.

The toddler does not have insurance or medicaid and has not had it since at least mid-october at the latest. We get to have her for a few hours on Monday. Today the ex said she wasn't itching at it anymore. We highly suspect neglect(but that's a whole other issue). My question is, should we take her to the ER to have it checked out and make sure it isn't the MRSA getting terribly bad? Would it be a non-emergency and not even treat her? Our theory is that way it's documented but we have a couple days so I wanted to get a general opinion. Obviously we can't take her to a regular doctor because she doesn't have insurance.

Edit: fixed confusing pronouns.

Edit 2: After several Yes's, that's the answer :P Never anything wrong with a second opinion.


**Update** Took her and mentioned several times we suspected neglect but the ER doctor and nurse said it was just a diaper rash(she also had a sore throat and bad diarrheaa.) They said she showed no signs of neglect and couldn't file a report but we got to talk to the social worker at the hospital and she told us to call CPS.

So while our attempts were less successful than intended, she finally seen a doctor for the current rash and we made sure she got the prescription she needed. It was $118 but the hospital gave us a voucher when we called the social worker back because we couldn't pay that. 

We also found out she did go to the Dr. Nov 14 and 17 for the rash but then her mom skipped the checkup appointment on Nov 21 =/ But she's been seen now at least. Thank you all.",15,6,2011-12-17,PHARMA,0.18468421697616577,0.7908087372779846,0.024507055059075356

Reddit, can you help me?","In January, when I was in India I got ill with a stomach upset - vomiting and diarrea for about three days. I cleared up fine, but around February/March I got low-grade nausea, but it didn't bother me too much. In April, it got worse, so I went to the doctor who took a blood test and then told me that I was incredibly healthy and sent me on my not so merry way. I dealt with it for a while and made some dietary changes, testing out a few different things, which didn't work. I hardly ate gluten/dairy/many preservatives to begin with, but totally cutting these out of my diet didn't make a difference to the nausea. In October I got awful nausea - I couldn't eat anything for four days and had trouble moving. The doctor prescribed me Motillium, which I took and it made the nausea bearable. Since October, I've been unable to exercise, and the nausea is starting to impede on my studies. 
I've had blood tests, ultrasounds on my liver, kidneys, spleen, and pancreas. I'm now on acid reflux tablets after finishing a course of Metronidazole, and before that Bactrex and probiotics. 
My midsection frequently hurts to touch, I get bloated no matter what I eat, and I feel horribly nauseas at least three times a day.

Health,Balls itch?  Finish showers with cold water.,"Inspired by this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nhk70/reddit_what_are_some_not_well_known_products_15/c395sky

After YEARS of chronic and embarrassing rashes and itchy redness, trying various soaps, skin treatments, and doctors--all of which never helped, I finally figured things out.  It was the long, hot showers I had been taking all my life that were causing my various skin problems.  Best of all, I didn't even have to give those up.  Instead, I just end showers with cool or cold water, and not even on my whole body.  Just getting the scalp, junk, and butt will do.  Only 20-30 seconds seems long enough for me.  Plus: rinse your hair off in cold water for better hair.

This is nothing new, of course.  Just google ""Scottish shower"" or ""James Bond shower"".  It was new to me, though.  I went through multiple doctors and dermatologists, and none of them ever even mentioned it, or even asked if I took hot showers.

Note: after lurking forever, I finally created a Reddit account, just for this post.  Word.

This caused me to fail my classes, since I found it nearly impossible to wake up, let alone function intelligently in class or at work, before 3pm.

Fortunately I've left that job, and now I'm ready to live like a normal person. However, my body clock is still completely off, and I just can't get it back to normal.

medicine,Wonder what the difference between 1 and 2 is during an eye exam?,"I'm in optometry school with some clinical experience. Our overall goal is for Clear, Comfortable vision.  Let me give you a breakdown of the exam from the visual perspective only, no pathology in this post.

-THIS IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE, BUT MEANT TO BE AN GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE PROCESS OF THE REFRACTIVE PORTION OF AN EYE EXAM.

-We check your visual acuity. ""Read the letters on the wall"" Gives us a base level.

-We then OBJECTIVELY check your RX (retinoscopy or autorefractor) and if it jives with your acuity, then we proceed. We expect about 1 line of letters lost for every 0.25 - 0.50 diopters of ametropia.  If not, then we start suspecting pathology, old or new, or amblyopia.  The objective measurement gives us only a baseline.  Autorefractors can only provide decent data; the best in evaluating the axis of astigmatism.

-Then we ask you which is better, 1 or 2 - changing only 1 factor at a time. We use a physchophysical approach to the questions, using bracketing and stair-stepping to find the correct answer.  This is a lot like engineering (previous work experience) problem solving / trouble shooting come into play. We expect truthful answers, even 'I don't know' tells us something.

-First we change the sphere, then the axis of cylinder (lenses / eyes can have two focal points for incoming light due to shape), then power of cylinder, then backtrack - axis of cylinder, then back to sphere so that we didn't ""OVER-MINUS"" you. See below for further explanation of this one. Finally we balance the stimulus to accommodation between the two eyes; even work loads for the ciliary muscles.

-Next we objectively / subjectively evaluate the vergence posture (alignment of the eyes) for tropias and phorias. Where the eyes position themselves in relation to each other. If someone has 'the googly eye', where it's noticeably out of alignment, then they are strabismic and have a degree of tropia. Some people have a smaller version of this, but their muscles are strong enough to counteract the issue: phoria. You'll see it manifest when they are tired or have been drinking. We see it when we cover one eye and then the other.  They'll complain of seeing double. Sometimes phorias can turn to tropias as you age.  Just like all other muscles, they get weaker.

-The eyes have a triad: accommodation, convergence, and miosis. Basically, when you focus on something up close (accommodation), your eyes come toward your nose (convergence) and your pupil constricts (miosis). All this happens at the same time automatically. 

-When you stimulate accommodation by over-minusing/under-plussing, you stimulate convergence.

-Over-minusing / Under-plussing is when the lens causes a stimulation of accommodation when looking in the distance. Not harmful, but causes the ciliary muscle to remain flexed at all times. You can see clearly (provided you're under 42-ish), but will fatigue and get headaches among other things. It can also cause a person to overwhelm their compensatory eye muscle power leading to a tropia.

-Most people have enough muscle power to account for small misalignments of their eyes. Some people are on the borderline (either at distance or at near). When you over-minus / over-plus a person that is borderline, you could make them decompensate - go from a manageable phoria to a tropia (they'll see double), or go from a comfortable phoria to an uncomfortable phoria. The degree by which a change in dioptric lens power changes the vergence (eye alignment) is the AC/A ratio: for every diopter change in power, there is a prism diopter change in vergence.

-There is no perfect answer, mostly compromises between clarity and comfort. That part takes experience. It costs a lot of money to remake someone's glasses that are dissatisfied.  That is why there is an art and a science to prescribing.  You could make a computer program to get the perfect refraction, but that could lead to unhappy patients.  You have to take into account the human element, based on history, needs, and goals.  Some people need precision; for some that'd be sensory overload.

-Some of our more 'experienced' patients require help for seeing up close. This takes an extra level of expertise. Basically, all it takes is being good at asking questions and finding out where they have the greatest need, taking into account age, and Rx.

-We also evaluate the health of the eye (as a primary eye healthcare provider). If your Rx was -0.50D in both eyes, but one eye only saw 20/100 (or 6/30 for our metric users), then there is another cause for the loss. We look at the front (cornea and tear film), the middle (lens and vitreous), and the back (retina, nerve, and choroid) for reasons for the loss. Pupil constrictions and eye movements help identify neurological causes for vision loss and diplopia.

-The eye is a very complicated part of your body, but vision is much more so because the eye is nothing but an extension of the brain. If you mess with parts of the brain (occipital lobe, Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, Optic Tract, Optic Chiasm, swollen pituitary gland, high CSF pressure, etc. etc.), then things go south pretty quickly.

-Lastly, children while still developing need good vision from early on to help with appropriate vision development. They continue to develop until they're around 8 or 10.  If they don't have proper vision or alignment, then the brain can actively stunt nerve growth by shutting down signals to a particular eye (or both). This is called amblyopia and is usually easily prevented with early exams. Adults are one thing, but children are another. In the US, we give free exams to ALL young children through the InfantSee program.  Most doctors recommend a first eye exam around 2-3 years old, no later than 4.

-Lastly, before you say glasses are a rip off because you can get the same thing cheaper, it's not.  It's like comparing a Mercedes to a Kia and saying they're the same.  You're right and you're wrong.  It depends on your needs and wants.  Extras cost extra.  Besides, those $9 frames aren't typically made by adult American / Japanese / European workers in factories with good labor laws...  Typical markup is 100%, the same or worse than many other retail products.

My brother has been diagnosed at different times with autism and prader-willi syndrome. I'm inclined to think it is autism, but I don't know for a fact because my parents, who dealt with the hospital, can't communicate/remember what tests the hospital conducted.

My brother's been living at home (Houston, TX) without any sort of social or intellectual activity for the past year and a half. My parents had told me about his condition worsening, but I didn't realize the extent of it until I got home today for Christmas. He now relieves himself without going to the bathroom. He doesn't shower unless my parents force him to. He'll alternately starve himself and binge. He stands in one spot doing repetitive movements and ignores all types of communication. He doesn't speak except to himself. He's lost a lot of weight. It's terrifying to see him this way.

What do I do? I'm at a complete loss as to where to start. And I worry that once I leave, my parents will not be able to follow through with any plans I start while I'm here. Help! :(",23,30,2011-12-20,PHARMA,0.15211530029773712,0.8204032778739929,0.02748139016330242

I'm writing on my novelty account because I'm a little embarrassed, but I have this bump right now on my butt. It's be going on for like a year, where it will fill up with puss, get to about an inch in diameter, then pop and leak puss and blood, then a few weeks later when it heals it starts filling up again. In the week before it pops it gets to be extremely painful to sit it and the skin area gets hot.

Health,If you have an autoimmune disorder it may be nothing more than a bacterial infection.,"I've had arthritis, among other problems (tendonosis, periphial neuropathy, muscle weakness) going on for the past 3-4 months now. Doctors has no idea, and just the other day I came across what I have which is called reiter's syndrome or reactive arthritis I believe due to an infection with an atypical pneumonia, specifically chlamydiophila pneumonia.

From what I can tell c. pneumonia has only been recognized predomintantly in the past decade, and is still very often overlooked. C. Pneumonia specifically has been linked to various autoimmune diseases, so far I have found multiplesclerosis, lupus, gillian barre, miller fisher synndrome, as well as athlerosclerosis. Most of this I only discovered through reading published papers as there's not too much in the news about it yet or I'd have linked something.

I urge you to be aware of this and talk to your doctor if you have an autoimmune disorder, but don't be surprised if they don't know what you're talking about. If I hadn't done independant research over the past few months I have no idea how far or long this would have gone on, everyone seemed to want to write it off as something simple to the point where they would literally ignore half of my symptoms (or more : /) to shoe horn me into a diagnosis; nuerologist said it was a nerve compression, 1 of my docs acted like it was all in my head even saying it was anxiety, geez. I knew  there was something wrong with me though and sometimes no one will look out for you, but yourself, you gotta push these things. I would not be surprised if in the next 10-20 years we discover most auto immune disorders are nothing more than pesky bacterial or viral infections. 

My prognosis is good btw, I hope to make a full recovery within 6 months and have only minor-moderate pain as it is.

Health,Frustrated Redditor with Muscular Dystrophy Trying to Help Myself,"So, I'll get to it then:

I'm in my 20s, and I have [Fascioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facioscapulohumeral_muscular_dystrophy). 
(TL;DR version of it - muscles waste over time. Not life threatening, but every case is different and wasting can be faster or slower per person. Sometimes you end up in a wheelchair.)

So, my particular case is much worse than average. I've always been weak for my age, but starting at about 18, I went downhill fast. At this point, now 25, I basically have one good leg and the rest of my limbs are shot. I can't lift things, and if I put my weight on my right left I immediately fall down. Most of the fingers on my right hand don't really work anymore, save for my thumb and pinky. Another effect is the loss of abdominal muscles, so now I have what looks like a beer gut, but there's nothing there to protect my organs. If someone ever gets pissed at me and I get punched in the stomach, I could be completely fucked. It's also very difficult to sit up from a prone position. 

This has been getting worse, and will continue to get worse, until I can't walk anymore. I'm already useless when it comes to 'man tasks,' and even typing at a keyboard is slowing down noticeably for me....

In terms of emotional toll, let's just say it's fucking terrible and leave it at that. I also keep it to myself, because I don't want to ladle my self-pity on anyone else, and frankly, it could be worse. This is actually the most I've ever written or spoken about it to anyone. 

So, anyway, I'll get to my purpose of posting -- I'm well aware that there are no good treatments for this, yet. There's something called ""ace-031"" which has been in development for a while, but it doesn't look like it's going to be produced anytime soon. 

So, I'm taking a huge shot in the dark here, in hopes that some of you fine people know something that I don't. Maybe it's a doctor who's aggressively developing treatments for degenerative diseases. Maybe it's a new study that doesnt show up on [clinicaltrials.gov](clinicaltrials.gov). 

Furthermore, if anyone has information on pharmaceutical law in countries other than the US, and how that relates to developing new treatments, I'd also love to learn more about that.

Health,Face skin always peeling - help!,"I'm a 23 year old male. For the past few years, the skin on my face has constantly flaked and peeled off. My skin isn't particularly dry; it feels tight after I wash it, but it generally tends toward being oily. I wash my face twice a day with Purpose soap and I apply Neutrogena moisturizer after washing (mostly to hide the peeling skin; moisturizer covers it up slightly). I frequently have to remove small flakes of dead skin from my face, which I do very carefully so as not to irritate my face. But day after day, in warm weather or cold weather, my face continues to peel.

I've done pretty extensive research online and the most likely candidate seems to be seborrheic dermatitis. However, my skin is not red or particularly itchy - it's just constantly peeling. And it doesn't just peel in the areas typically affected by seb derm (eyebrows, corners of mouth, side of nose). It peels everywhere, from my forehead to my cheeks, all over my nose and especially around my nostrils, on my chin, and on my jawline. I've tried using Nizoral shampoo on my face several days per week in the past, but it only seemed to aggravate the flaking.

Health,Anxiety issue or something else?,"This has been going on with me for a little over 3 months and there was an ""event"" where I noticed I feel the way I do. I had just gotten back from the east coast (I've looked into lyme disease) and went to my Thursday evening soccer game. In the middle of the game I started to feel kind of nauseas and my equilibrium was off (minor dizziness). I sat for about 10 minutes and it sort of ceased so I got back on the field and finished the game. The next morning I woke up and had flu like symptoms (weakness, clammy, aching), so I figured I'd just gotten a bug from travelling and such. The flu like symptoms went away but my equilibrium issue never fully went away and it's something I can bare with and still live my every day life. At first, the equilibrium issue was really the only symptom I had (sort of a light case of vertigo, not bad enough where I couldn't walk or lay a certain way). Since this ""event"" there are times of quote on quote ""higher stress"" where i'll have heart palpitations, the ""lump"" in the throat, tingling in my hands and sometimes feet, an increase in headaches, pins and needles sensations in the skin, clammy extremities, and increased sensitivity to being touched. These symptoms come and go and aren't all the time nor always at the same time when they do happen. I've also noticed that waking up after drinking any amount of alcohol the night before makes my symptoms worse (headaches, vertigo feeling). I just got back from Las Vegas today and after a fair amount of drinking last night, today has been my worst day by far. Granted, I was hungover, in an airport, then on an airplane for 3 hours.

I realize I should ask this question of the ENT I consulted, but it was awkward enough just asking him about alternatives to the surgery. He mentioned that the procedure is not common outside of the US, even in big cities like London. I searched a bit online, and saw many sources say it was the most common surgical procedure done on children in the US, but could find nothing about why it is not common outside the US.

I am not opposed to the surgery, I have already had one child go through it with flying colors, but this particular tidbit did not come up during her consult (it was a different ENT).",11,17,2011-12-25,PHARMA,0.0371040515601635,0.9125058650970459,0.05039013922214508

Health,Are these early signs of appendicitis or just random abdominal pain?,"Recently flew home to Korea from America, (flight left on the 22nd and arrived the 23rd), had indigestion immediately after from terrible airplane food. Indigestion mostly wore off after a day but I've still had some mild discomfort on the lower right part of my abdominal area.
The pain itself isn't anything sharp at all, just discomfort when I shift weirdly/get up from lying down. Feels most similar to when I pull a muscle in my arm and the discomfort I feel when I accidentally flex it.

Tried the the rebound pressure pain check and I only feel the discomfort when I push down on the area, when I release it the area immediately feels fine again. I did have a fever for awhile but have had zero nausea or vomiting, maybe my appetite has decreased a little but that could easily just be jetlag. Also probably the biggest sign against is that the pain I had during indigestion was located on both my lower left and lower right abdominal areas, and while the lower left feels better now the current pain I have is the same as the indigestion pain in the lower right area.

Only slightly concerned because I can't figure out what these symptoms could possibly be other than appendicitis. Only real theory I can come up with is that I spazzed out in the middle of sleeping on the airplane and somehow pulled an ab muscle by slamming against my seatbelt, but that seems pretty far-fetched.",5,7,2011-12-25,PHARMA,0.3240445554256439,0.639588475227356,0.036366939544677734
Health,Whom to trust when it comes to food?,"Hey, /r/health. I consider myself to be quite health-conscious. Most people on the internet say that eating as natural as possible is the healthiest thing you can do: many vegetables, little sugar, no artificial sweeteners, no heavily processed food. Actually, this seems quite logical to me. However, there are also many people who claim other things. Let me list a few examples:

There are [those who prefer a low-carb diet](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto). The most frequently mentioned point is, that this is the nutrition the human body is used to (yeah, this isn't entirely true, there is a difference between paleo and keto). I don't see much that can be said against that, but this completely contradicts this many-vegetables-little-meat-theory.

There are those who claim that artificial sweeteners are harmless. Sweeteners aren't healthy, but some people claim that studies proving their dangerousness are faked or manipulated by the sugar lobby.

There are those who claim that supplementation of things like omega-3-fatty-acids or Vitamin D3 is necessary or helpful. This makes sense to me because this stuff is important, but is isolated supplementation as good as ingesting this with real food?

I'm sure there are still other contradicting opinions, but those are the first that came to my mind. Because many opinions are spread by the particular industries I find it hard to say what is based on facts and what is true. What opinion do you have, /r/health?",2,4,2011-12-25,PHARMA,0.031402338296175,0.9308398962020874,0.03775782510638237

I booked an appointment with my doctor, he proscribed lansoprazole (PPI, acid reducer) he said this should stop it from occurring; Over the next week i had it a little, but the pills said it could take 4 days to take effect, so I waited. 

I went on vacation 4 days ago, and the night before I had awful heartburn (lasted 7 hours), and over the last 3 days I've had heartburn almost everyday, its killing me, I cant sleep, I cant do my school work, I cant enjoy anything. Nothing I take seems to help the pain - tums, gaviscon, rennie, Mylanta, Omeprazole (tried swapping lansoprazole for this), zantac. I'm only drinking water, and have cut carbs (living off lean chicken and salad atm and its still happening) - its extremely frustrating, as there doesnt seem to be a 'trigger'.

2. How did you manage long period of absences from school?
3. Have you taken Anikinra on demand? Did it cause low level of WBC?
4. How effective was Prednisolone if you had taken it?
5. Has anyone tried Lipitor as MVK gene responsible for the sickness is involved in making Cholestrol? Did it help?
6. How effective is Colchichine for HIDS? I know that it helps in FMF.
7. Does food allergy affect the sickness?
8. What precautions you took to prevent flare ups or episodes?
9. Is there any alternate medicine that is effective?
10. Did it get better with age?

Health,Question about lactose intolerance,"Is it unhealthy to consume lactose if you're lactose intolerant? I understand that it gives you a lot of gas, but if I'm at home for a while, I don't really care if I'm farting a lot because I absolutely love dairy products. I'd have a hard time completely giving them up. What I'm more interested in is whether or not it's actually detrimental to my health to be consuming lactose.

Health,"ASKHEALTH: After receiving a kick to the chest, I lost consciousness for about 30 seconds; What happened?","More info: Today, I was kneeling to tying my shoe and got a swift boot to the chest due to an unresolved conflict earlier in the day. For about 3 seconds I just gripped my chest and the next thing I know I have people over me trying to wake me up. I was out for approximately 30 seconds nothing was done to wake me up other than slapping me in the face repeatedly.
