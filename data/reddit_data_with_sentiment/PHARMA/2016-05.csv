medicine,Observations I've made during vacation.,"Good evening to everyone. I am wrapping up my vacation (I am a resident) and I would like to hear what others have to say about some things that I have been considering lately. During this time I have been happier, slept better, ate better, and exercised more. I have had the chance to do a lot of studying and also participate in several cultural events that I had been waiting years to see. Additionally, my home has never been cleaner! 

While working I was always frustrated with myself because my place was always a complete mess, my diet was deplorable, and exercise was non-existant. I could never get any studying done because at the conclusion of each day I was so tired the idea of reading for an hour felt fruitless. Working on Saturday or Sunday each week never helped either. Often I would sleep-in on my off day to offset the lack of sleep during the rest of the week. 

In truth, I have never understood why, in medical education, we take away so much free time. I know many of us struggle to find the motivation to study in the most ideal settings let alone after a long and stressful day in the office or on the hospital floors. 

I have known for quite some time how much happier I am when my workload and stress is at a minimum. 

Some questions... Is there any more advice other than to sleep more and to look forward to the next vacation (or full weekend)? How does anyone actually get reading done at the end of a busy day? How do you keep your places clean and tidy? Any other thoughts you'd like to add would be welcomed. 

A side note I would like to add... 
Time is valuable. We all knew before residency that we would get little down time. That being said did anyone else think that instead of some rotations in 3rd and 4th years you would have benefitted more if you were given a reference book (for example a book on par with Step Up to Medicine) and UWorld questions?",18,137,2016-05-01,PHARMA,0.04662815108895302,0.9156815409660339,0.03769027441740036

Patient Safety at risk?,"Anyone else see the recent [60-minutes report](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-investigates-medical-gear-sold-during-ebola-crisis/) on gown manufacturers?  I have noticed a fair amount of strike through with these paper gowns.  While my own safety is a concern, patient safety is another one.  Anyone else have thoughts?

EDIT:
Strike-through is when the bodily fluids from a surgical case penetrate the surgical gown.

60 minutes investigated and found the manufacturer was knowledgeable of defects, but continued to sell the gowns.  The story specifically mentions ebola because many health care workers were killed.

While this is devastating, putting the surgical team at risk, what goes one way goes the other.  Strike-through likely results in a contaminated surgical field.

pharmacy,Shout Out To All You Awesome People,"This is a rave post.

First to you drug-store pharmacists, I thank you all. I watch as you are swarmed day in and day out but still go the extra mile. I usually go to a clinic inside a drug-store and so my prescriptions get sent right over. I've been very sick a couple times and the pharmacists, different ones every time, have been so kind to come from behind the counter and allow me to stay sitting while they rang me out/got my prescriptions filled immediately. Once when I got worse and had to go elsewhere for treatment, the pharmacist recognized me when I went to get my prescription filled and she asked how I was doing and seeing I was there for more aggressive medications, had me sit and took care of me. As someone that is living here without family, these small acts of kindness were so amazing to experience from complete strangers.

Next to hospital pharmacists, I thank you so much for all your hard work meeting the demands of a full hospital. The constant calls from nurses, new orders from doctors constantly coming in,etc etc. 

Just thank you all. You are not over-looked.",3,74,2016-05-03,PHARMA,0.050338469445705414,0.9124897718429565,0.03717169910669327
medicine,"Medicine has stolen my wife's creative side, will it return?","My wife is an American R3 in primary care, and this path has taken away her fun loving personality.

I'd go find a doctors husbands group for advice, but those don't seem to exist, and the doctors wives groups are stricter on gender than a North Carolia Restroom (I'm new to Reddit, but the rules said I needed flair, so I hope that joke meets the cut).

Anyways, now I'm here, and I hope you can share your tips on happiness/silliness/anti-depression that helped in your training pipeline.

My wife is really focused, always doing whatever it takes to be the best. From board scores and being the top of her medical school class to being the best intern/resident/senior she has been buried in journals, conducting research and getting published. The sheer amount of secondary tasks she takes on amazes me.

I do what I can to help streamline her life, I make her meals, take care of the finances, plan vacations and date nights, set up ""girls nights out"" for her with non-medical but still professional women so she can have time away from medicine, but not spend that time talking about boring day to day tasks.

All this and she's still not her old fun loving self.

She used to have hobbies, so did I, but between me taking care of the kids, and her 80 hour weeks, the hobbies have gone the way of the dodo.

medicine,New BMJ report shows that medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the US.,"This paper brings up an interesting argument about our accounting for errors in the US. The researchers posit that we need better accounting of medical errors and death due to medical errors need to be accounted for. The CDC says that they already are and it's up to doctors to properly code for medical errors as the cause of death on death certificates. This sounds counterintuitive because doctors would be under intense self-preserving pressures to not list medical error as a cause of death on the death certificate. 

It's also interesting that the research article doesn't try to separate out medical errors in training institutions and non-training or based on provider vs mid-level providers to help see if the problems are concentrated on where we go for care or whether our training is a problem.

Hi r/medicine! First time poster, long time lurker.

I am a mature student hoping to get into medical school within the next 1-4 years but I have a few tattoos (arms, back, back of neck) and I plan on getting more. Currently I plan on specialising in Psychiatry however I'm open to other possibilities once I'm in my foundation years.

Will my tattoos hinder my chances of getting jobs? I don't plan on getting neck or hand tattoos currently but will probably be 50-70% covered elsewhere later on in life. Do any of you have or know any Doctors that have tattoos? How has it affected them? 

Any info would be appreciated. Thanks!",90,83,2016-05-07,PHARMA,0.02311309613287449,0.9039957523345947,0.07289110869169235

I have a Ph.D in molecular biology, I work in biotech and have a lot of experience analyzing molecular data from pre-clinical models and patients alike.  So, from a biological perspective I know my shit, and if I don't, then am competent at learning it, because it's literally my job.  It also means that I am capable of reading and comprehending clinical research papers.  Since I'm a scientist and we should know what we don't know, I am very aware of the fact that I didn't go to medical school, nor do I possess years of institutional knowledge and intuition, so in no way do I think I can do the job of a clinician myself.  Now, every time a non-trivial medical question for me or a family member arises, I go into research overdrive.  I can't tell if I am more or less annoying than the average patient google-er -- there is a 100% chance I'm not going to be asking about some homeopathic solution in lieu of chemotherapy, because science, but for the most part I've found my doctors (my kids' pediatrician, my Mom's oncologists, my endocrinologist, my GP) to be patient and even excited when I start pulling out papers for them to look at.  Sometimes they are clinically relevant, but even if they aren't (like I found out I have a particular SNP that disposes me to thyroid cancer, and while that's nice and all it will not impact any decisions that my endocrinologist will make) then they've been happy to engage even with a busy schedule.  It's honestly something I do to test the clinician, not only to make sure that they're up on their research game and care about the molecular basis of their field, but also to see they are intellectually passionate about what they are doing.   I live in a town where we have some of the top research hospitals, and also where you can't swing a cat without hitting someone with a background like me, so perhaps it's a nice side effect of the ecosystem I'm in? I need to google when faced with something troubling, it actually calms me.  Maybe it's because I'm a scientist, but I've seen other non-scientist caregivers/patients that have amassed an impressive amount of scientific/clinical knowledge about their disease areas of interest too.  

I'd be curious actually, how many of you find people like me annoying?  Or refreshing?

medicine,How did you overcome your fear of your own judgment?,"Recently had one of the physicians ask me why I do not consider going to med-school.  The context is, I continually bug him for the 'why' of something.  Perhaps bug is the incorrect term, but you get the idea.  Many beers have been had while he explains things to me.   My answer, after much thought is that I do not trust myself to make the judgment calls that really matter, that I think physicians make all the time.  

I know that some nurses constantly question why a doctor will choose one therapy over another, or seemingly ignores something that seems significant to us with our level of knowledge.  But, in my mind, at the end of the day, the onus is on the doctor since effectively they are the one ultimately responsible.  

I worry that I would seriously screw up everything.  Sure, I can put in an IV, and I can assess vital signs, and there's a lot of things I can do. But I just worry that I would constantly be wrong since much of the time when I ask my friend to explain something, its because I was wrong about something.    

Anyway, I'd appreciate your thoughts.",25,35,2016-05-13,PHARMA,0.07750659435987473,0.8888866305351257,0.03360672667622566

medicine,What health myths do you see regularly circulating that sounds right to general public but you are convinced isn't accurate?,"Im sure it has to get under some of your skins to see this malarky that people see, consume, take as fact, and redistribute.

ie: I have a Facebook acquaintance who has a significant following talking about pH and diet (he has strong interests with... drum roll.. naturopaths who wrote the book on pH and hormone biology'). In his video he speaks about eating foods that make you acidotic, qouting a pH of 7.0 as being associated with poor diets, and his intervention to improve it (other non-fact based 'but sounds like it could be right' in the vid as well)... And he gets likes and shares!! 

I PM'd him and told him in a civil way why he should reshoot it and how he could word things differently. His response is that the Naturopath is more informed than I, I have my opinion and it may be accurate, but he is confident he's correct and he seeks to simplify things for his audience..

Small example, but I am tired of this circle jerk of misinformation masquerading as facts going across the internet. In addition to all Im doing, I am thinking about starting PRN an informed evidence/science based approach to common health myths and misinformation that's being distributed. 

Ideas? Suggestions? Worth it? Before saying no, know that we will have more patients going on gut feelings than science base, coming in with questions from what they've googled or read online to your office, ...etc. I want to cage this before it gets out of control.

medicine,Sometimes I hate being the physician in the family (or how ignorance really is bliss),"It's been a rough year for my family, with many members suffering diseases, accidents and untimely deaths. In many of those cases I've been asked to help ''translate'' the medspeak into commonspeak for them and that has been a very tough experience on me, especially when I can see what they can't: a grim prognosis.

My uncle passed away last year, he was an incredibly functional alcoholic, to the grade that no one really noticed his (brutal) level of drinking until he developed varices and upper bleeding... which he also hid so well, he managed to die of exsanguination in 3 days. I was in a social event when mom called, very altered, telling me my uncle was being resucitated in the hospital (he had been feeling ''down'' from what he called stomach flu). Now, lay people think miracles about CPR, but that was my first ''oh shit'' moment, I knew the probabilities of coming out of that intact. Then, I get to the hospital and barge right inside the ER and ask for some news, specific news (labs, all that). I get the horrible news: he arrives 5 minutes in cardiac arrest, pH 6.8, lactate 28 and similar other levels. All my family in the waiting room is hoping for his recovery and I already know its over. 

Now, a year later, an aunt gets an endoscopy for some unclear GI symptoms and a huge tumor comes in the study. Biopsy studies are pending but I know the probabilities, the high chance of it being already stage III or IV and all that comes with it.

Sometimes being the educated person in the room is so horrible.

pharmacy,Tips for P4 students,"My site (long term care) takes students every month, and they've ranged from absolutely awesome to piss-poor, with most students being adequate and forgettable. We treat the students as a hiring pool and have hired two former students in the last year, so it's really a good idea to impress your preceptors. I'm surprised this stuff isn't common sense, but here goes:

-The shitty students:

- show up late

- ask for time off (for reasons other than interviews) 

- don't offer to make up time missed

- ask *really* stupid questions

- try to avoid work

- Pretend not to see the ""grunt work"" and have to be asked on a daily basis to do it

- Think that only the preceptor ""counts"" and don't work hard if he/she isn't looking

-The adequate students:

- show up on time every day

- do the work as asked

- wear professional attire, act in a professional manner

-The great students:

- Jump right in when they see something needs to be done

- Ask what else they can do to help

- Look enthusiastic

- Do the grunt work that we know isn't very fun, without being asked

- Are friendly and personable

- Ask smart questions

- Demonstrate interest in the field/let us know they like the rotation

Treat your rotations like month-long job interviews. Even if you don't care for the site, keep your options open and don't burn any bridges. Pharmacy is a small world and pharmacists talk to each other so you don't want to make a poor impression on anyone. Keep in mind that even the staff that aren't your direct preceptors might have influence that you don't know about, so work to impress them too. Oh, and send a nice thank you note after your rotation; it's a nice touch and helps us remember your name.",54,55,2016-05-20,PHARMA,0.0485667884349823,0.9172801971435547,0.0341530442237854

pharmacy,Finally I'm a happy pharmacist!,"To all current miserable Rph, don't lose hope. I was another  naive student who graduated 6 yrs ago who thgt that retail was the best fit for me. Got burned quickly with CVS ( BTW I was a trainee  for pharmacy supervisor) and made the switch to omnicare. Huge pay cut of 20k but took the leap of faith and after 2 good years, changes in management and mundane work made me search for new job.

Finally it happened, pharmacist consultant for LTC pharmacy! Make my own hours, paid travel and accommodation and great boss. Its been 6 months now and I started loving my profession once again. 

So I suggest to keep searching, take a chance if you can, opt for smaller upcoming companies as opposed to major corporations. As for current pharmacy students, endulge in every pharmacy field you can think of. Take advantage of your rotations and make sure you save your contacts. I am not sure how long  this new gig of mine will last but now I finally know which pharmacy niche is best for me.

Our profession is the one of the best but we let greed of businessman make it miserable for us.

medicine,"Spanish speakers, do you use tu or usted with patients?","I tried googling this but had a hard time finding a direct answer to my question.

I'm on FM right now, and there's tons of opportunities to practice my Spanish, which is great, but...

I was just realizing today that I've been using ""tu"" with patients and not usted. Have I been impolite or unprofessional? It sounds silly when I ask like that, but I just wanted to see if anyone here had any opinions on the matter, or if they have a preference. 

For what it's worth, none of the patients I've spoken Spanish to seem to mind in the slightest; in fact, they all seem to be pleased that I'm just trying and able to converse a little bit. 

**Edit:** I don't think anyone's catching my comment at the bottom of the thread. To recap  it, I will now use usted - thanks all for the help.

pharmacy,A drug addicted pharmacy student,"My uncle's a community based pharmacist who is involved in internships for pharmacy students in their final year of studies. Every year he takes in a couple of students to supervise and train. About 8 years ago he had a student, lets call him C., who was really significantly below average - completely disorganised and struggling badly. Things came to a head when he simply failed to submit a mandatory major assignment. Uncle G visited him at home to find out what the problem was. To keep the story short, he eventually found out that C was VERY heavily abusing alcohol and marijuana.

Now at this point most people would have sent him packing, but uncle believes in second chances. So out of his own pocket he arranged for drug counselling and additional one-on-one tuition. Of course he also notified the appropriate pharmacy/university authorities about the situation and they put C on an intensive monitoring regime.

A few weeks pass and after an initial improvement C reverts to his old habits with absenteeism and no real improvement in his work despite all the effort uncle was putting in. After another major assignment was missed he was finally dismissed. Uncle G was distraught because he treats all his students like his own children.

Somehow C managed to re-sit his final year and graduate (a frightening thought - I don't know how he managed it or what conditions the pharmacy board put on his practise). Anyway barely a year went by before I saw his name in the court news.  He was convicted of dealing various controlled drugs. Of course at this point he's instantly deregistered and spends time in jail. Uncle was again distraught because he felt this was a personal failure of his to help C sort his life out (he is just that sort of guy).

Why am I posting this now? Well last week C turns up at the pharmacy out of the blue and asks to speak with my uncle in private. He tells my uncle ""he forgives him for everything."" Seriously WHAT THE FUCK.",15,54,2016-05-22,PHARMA,0.0896824300289154,0.881058931350708,0.02925865352153778

b) is it practical? More precisely, is there any point for a doctor to get in the field of CS, or is it just a waste of time?

The last time that happened to me the Dr was giving me crap about bringing Bailey in but at the time we had no insurance so she'd had a fever for over a week. It would break and then come back and of course when I finally took her in, her fever had broken. But I insisted something was wrong because she just couldn't get well I before had had pneumonia and this was the same thing and I knew it as her mother. He finally did an Xray which didn't show the pneumonia, but I absolutely hate it when Drs don't listen to the parents. I had antibiotics thankfully to give her from when I had been sick and she did get better soon after that so thank goodness for parents who know their kids and insist they know something's wrong.

Then, as a reply someone wrote: J is sick today. They did a rapid Strep and it was negative, so they are doing a culture just in case. He thinks there is a viral infection. I srill worry it is strep and he just has to find it or it will turn into strep later this week and we will be behind where we could be by then by not starting treatment. So I told him and he did agree that he will treat it anyways. Thank goodness, he is a good Dr. and respects parents. I'm sorry you had such a bad time!

pharmacy,The phone rang (graphic),"**ring...ring**

The phone rings again.

**ring...ring**

You're slammed, and there's three other people that could answer it.

**ring...ring**

You give in.

'Hello, pharmacy?'

'Hi, this is Britney, can you verify my Tylenol order on 6103?'

'Sure, it will be done shortly.'

'OK, right away!'

**click**

You hang up. You hover on the verify button wondering how to spite someone who called within 30 seconds of entering an order. ""It's what's best for the patient.""

You OK it and move on.

The phone rings.

**ring...ring**

Laura answers it.

'Yeah...ok...will do.'

You have no idea what that person wants, but hope it gets done to avoid another phone call.

**ring...ring**

5652...it's Andy in the ER. I bet he wants his Morphine verified like always.

Andy: 'Hi, we have a pediatric cardiac arrest, we need a pharmacist.'

Time slows. You think about what information you need. 

-Which patient? which room? what age? what weight? what allergies? what height? why?

'Somewhere between 19-25 kilos, room 15'

**CLICK**

The dial tone reminds you of asystole.

You grab whatever resources you can manage to muster. 9 hours into a 12 hour shift, you remember you haven't eaten yet today.
Your hands shake. Is it from fear? nervousness? low glucose?

You rush to the ED. Nothing in 6 years of school can prepare you for what you see. Sliding the translucent door open, you see an episode of ER.

In one corner, the physician running the code, barking orders to anyone and everyone.

In another corner, the parents, bawling and praying for their child.

In corner number 3, four paramedics and two police officers getting statements.

And in the last corner, at least 6 staff members doing their best.

And in the middle, the three year old. Found upside down in the pool.

The first nurse comes to you and says 'We've been pushing 1.9 of epi and we did 19 of bicarb.'

You try to make sense of what they said.

All you can see is the bright light shining on the patient, reflecting off the family. The nurse continues compressions.

THIS LOOKS LIKE A SHOCKABLE RHYTHM. CLEAR


The child shakes


You look around. You're the only one in a white coat.

'Why am I here?'

*flash back*

Someone gave me numbers - check them

(Dosages seem correct. We're pushing 0.01 mg/kg epi, we've done 1 meq/kg bicarb, the 2 joule/kg shock has ended, and now we're doing 4 joules/kg while the 20 ml/kg bolus is running.)

I confirm with the nurses dosages, volumes, frequencies. Suddenly, everyone is more calm.

'Why am I here?'

After nearly an hour of CPR, the physician gets a final echo and calls it.

""Time of death 1921.""

A kid has died.

There's at least 15 people in the room and 10 outside. As it's pronounced, everyone slowly exits.

The monitor beeps along slowly until it's turned off.

A nurse stops me and thanks me for being there.

The only sound remaining is a mother and father in the room, crying and begging for their child to come back.

Is this the bargaining stage of grief? Why am I here?

Tell yourself 'You have to be strong, you're running the pharmacy right now'

You pass a nurse wiping tears from her face as you walk by the pyxis.

As you walk inside the pharmacy, everyone looks to you wondering what happened?

'They called it.' You say. 'There was nothing more they could do.'

Heads turn down; people get depressed. 

They can be sad, but this is my second pediatric death this month.

**ring...ring**

Whenever someone comes in and they have an elevated WBC or they are thinking it's a SIRS type picture, they're going to get a troponin. They say it's part of their ""Sepsis Protocol.""

They refuse to rule out ACS in their ED and force us residents to admit the patients to rule out ACS even if it's a poor story and the first troponin is negative with no EKG changes. 

ED docs in my VA cant intubate or start central lines b/c they're too incompetent. 

Essentially they order a rainbow of labs and obtain a ROS and call us to admit the patient, often times admitting them for a diagnosis that I have to stretch my ethical barometer to make.

This is for purely expectant management of NAS; that is, the infant in most cases is at reasonably low risk of NAS and has no clinical evidence of NAS at the time of transfer out of the nursery.  I'm an older pediatrician, and this was in my experience always an issue that was monitored in the outpatient setting (assuming relatively intact and loving families who could be relied upon to follow-up appropriately).  Is there good evidence to support this practice?  I don't mind babysitting these infants, but I do object to the havoc it creates with the families involved, and to the risks associated with moving an infant from a relatively clean nursery environment onto a general adult medical ward where the risk of nosocomial infection is likely very much higher, the nursing staff is less familiar with newborn care, and the nurse to patient ratio is much worse than in the nursery.",8,34,2016-05-29,PHARMA,0.08575300872325897,0.8761236667633057,0.03812338784337044

pharmacy,Colistin-resistant E. coli in the United States – what does it mean?,"Last week there were a few headlines related to “the superbug doctors have been dreading,” and some comments regarding sensationalism. I wanted to take a couple paragraphs to review the facts and discuss the clinical implications, while hopefully avoiding sensationalism.


**Where it all Began**

The spread of the *mcr-1* gene is impressive. It was first reported by a research team out of China last November.(1) Researchers isolated a colistin-resistant strain of *E. coli* from a pig. This *E. coli* was capable of transferring colistin resistance to other bacteria, a phenomenon not seen before. Previously, colistin resistance had always arisen secondary to chromosomal mutations, not transfer of genetic elements. The research team used whole genome sequencing to characterize the resistance gene, *mcr-1*, which was found on a plasmid. They subsequently assessed prevalence of the resistance gene by screening isolates collected across China between 2011 and 2014. The team identified *mcr-1* carriage in 78/523 raw meat samples, 166/804 animal samples, and 16/1322 inpatient samples.

**The USA Report**

On May 26th, *Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy* reported what seems to be the first case of an *E. coli* strain harboring the *mcr-1* gene being isolated from a human in the United States.(2) The patient was a 49 y/o woman who presented to a clinic in Pennsylvania with symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Of note, the patient had not traveled outside the United States in the previous 5 months. The isolate was sent to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for susceptibility testing (I am assuming this is standard practice for the clinic, but that is not explicitly clear from the case report), where it was determined the organism was an ESBL-producing *E. coli*. Walter Reed had recently started screening all ESBL-producing *E. coli* for colistin resistance, ever since the initial report of a plasmid-borne colistin resistance gene last winter, and so used an E-test to determine colistin susceptibility.

The isolate was one of the first 6 ESBLs screened at Walter Reed for colistin resistance. The colistin MIC was 4 mcg/mL (~~CLSI breakpoint &lt;/= 0.25 mcg/mL~~ **SEE EDIT**). Real-time PCR detected the presence of the *mcr-1* gene. The isolate’s genome was then sequenced. Two plasmids carrying a total of 15 resistance genes were isolated. Most notable from this sequencing was the revelation that the colistin resistance gene (*mcr-1*) was on the same plasmid as the ESBL gene (CTX-M). No carbapenemase genes were identified. Additionally, the genes were on an IncF plasmid, which is a plasmid associated with a high rate of genetic transfer.

At the time of publication, Walter Reed had tested a total of 26 isolates and no others carried were resistant to colistin. The actual report does not detail the outcome of the patient in question, but my understanding is she was treated with other antibiotics. This is the first known case in the United States of a bacteria carrying *mcr-1*.

**Like a Double Rainbow, What Does it Mean?**

The isolate from the US remained susceptible to several antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and amikacin. Thus, the isolate does not, on its own, warrant any great concern. In fact, if Walter Reed had not been screening isolates specifically for colistin resistance, no one would have known. Colistin susceptibility testing is not done clinically unless necessary, like with carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae. But even though this isolate was not a pan-resistant superbug, there are some broad implications that we should consider.

**Takeaway 1: This is the first case of *mcr-1* in the United States, *because we just started looking for it*.** Because we did not know this gene existed before last November, no one was looking for it. Additionally, most microbiology labs are not set up to perform genetic sequencing for specific genes, unless it comes as part of a PCR platform (e.g. BioFire, Verigene, T2). So in reality, this is likely just the tip of the iceberg. Since the publication of the first report in November, researchers across the globe have sequenced historic isolates from food, environmental, and clinical samples and tested for *mcr-1*. There are over two dozen publications related to findings of *mcr-1* in Asia, Europe, and Canada.(3) In other words, *mcr-1* is global and has been found in isolates first collected as far back as 2005, so it is in all likelihood present in the United States.

**Takeaway 2: While this isolate was treatable, pan-resistance may be around the corner.** In this case, *mcr-1* co-occurred with an ESBL gene, both on a single plasmid. But there are at least 4 reports of *mcr-1* isolated in conjunction with a carbapenemase (1 animal and 3 clinical isolates). Even more concerning, is 2 of those 4 isolates involved the carbapenemase NDM, against which none of the new Gram-negative agents are active.(3) The NDM/*mcr-1* clinical isolate was susceptible only to amikacin.(4) All told, these trends suggest to me that something needs to be done to curb the pressures leading to spread of these resistance genes.

**Takeaway 3: This is an environmental and veterinary problem first and a clinical problem second.** China seems to be the world’s largest user of colistin for agricultural/veterinary use, and is also where this resistance gene was first isolated. Perhaps coincidence, perhaps not. Either way, the wonton use of antibiotics for livestock needs to be reined in. Interventions on the clinical side (isolation, antimicrobial stewardship, etc) can only do so much, and the Gram-negative pipeline is grim right now.

In summary, the isolate found in the US was not the harbinger of the antibiotic apocalypse. But, it is something to be concerned about and likely represents the tip of the iceberg. Fortunately, carbapenemase + colistin resistance remains very rare. But we need to take steps to limit the spread of resistance and mitigate risk of pan-resistant infections in the future. Hopefully this was a somewhat unbiased review of what has been going on with *mcr-1* over the last 6 months.

medicine,Emergency Medicine Case 1,"I posted this in a different sub, but I wanted to post it here also because I think it is a great teaching case. While I know everyone is going to DDx this thing. I also want everyone to see what was done wrong. Whether you think I(in my formative years lol), or the other doctor did something wrong, I think it is always good to analyze all aspects of a case. This is especially true for my fellow residents and medical students who are still learning. 

This was during R1 ""long ago"".
This was the history I got as a radiologist(it was actually pretty good). 45 y/o male came into the ER after enduring trauma to the chest. Patient complains of sharp chest pain within the last 24 hours. Hx: Atherosclerosis. Partial occlusion of the r. pulm a. nonspecific heart murmur heard. No lab work, no prior imaging studies. BP slightly elevated, but otherwise all vitals normal.
CXR: I found mediastinal widening and L. pleural effusion. What would this maybe make you think radiologically given what we know so far?
If you thought like me, what imaging would you order(or recommend to order) next(think before you read next paragraph)

ER Doc(resident) wanted to get an MRI after reading my report, I denied his request because it wasn't going to be medically necessary. I was very nervous with my DDx, so I paged the EM resident and attending to order a different test, after 15 min, no answer. Due to the acute nature of my DDx and according to ABR criteria I ordered Double contrast CT.

My CT Findings: Intimal Flap found. Potential displacement of intimal calcification. Minimal, but present TA dilation

EM resident finally answered after getting my second report. He asked what he should do next, I recommended a TEE. So EM paged cardiology. and why did I order it. There was a better test to order, but that test was not available at the time, what test would have been better to order knowing the Dx.

According to the cardiologist... TEE findings: completely ""normal"" 

My findings?: not going to say since it will make or break the diagnosis, but let's see if you can guess. I decided to take a look, I knew there had to be something objectively wrong.

What is the DDx? What is the Dx? What exact findings made me think of this Dx? What consult was called? What is the treatment? What is the prognosis(statistically)?",76,114,2016-05-31,PHARMA,0.08331339806318283,0.8841549158096313,0.03253171592950821
