Health,I'm having troubles staying awake in school and I'm always tired. Does anyone have an idea of the problem?,"So it started seventh grade year when I started getting drowsy in history and then one day I fell asleep in class. This started to continually happen after. Since then, it's progressively gotten worse. I'm in 11th grade now and I fall asleep nearly every day in at least one class, sometimes multiple classes. On a normal basis I get 8-9 hours of sleep which from what I've heard is plenty. However I know it varies. On weekends when I get to sleep in, I often sleep 11-12 hours, wake up, and am still groggy for most of the day. If I can keep my self entertained with either intriguing school work (such as chemistry or history) or video games, I don't fall asleep so I'm assuming it's a problem with lack of quantity or quality of sleep, not a chronic disorder or such. Other info that may be of relevance- I am 16, I've grown and am still growing a lot (I'm currently 6' 4""), I eat a ton and am always hungry, I'm 160-170 pounds, and even though I sleep a lot I get excellent grades in school.

medicine,A really good chance my 5 year old son will have a liver transplant early in the morning.,"We got the call earlier today, after a bunch of labs we are just sitting and waiting. Please shower me with success stories, I could really use it.

Edit: 5 year old, alpha 1 anti trypsin deficiency. Cirrhosis, esophageal varices. History of ascites. He had one chest bleed and also an episode of sbp. Most of the time, an extremely normal, healthy kid. He was in kindergarten when we got the call earlier today, so it's bizarre thinking about him being healthy one day and a 10 hour procedure followed by all of the hell the little guy is going to go through afterwards.


Edit 2: The surgery is going to happen. It was pushed to 10:30am pacific time. Spending time together now. Damn, this doesn't feel real at all.

Edit 3: aaaand everything worked out, little man is in surgery as I type. 

Edit 4: He has been in surgery for about 5 hours now, we have received a handful of updates from one of the surgical nurses. Last one was that the old liver is out, and the surgeons were beginning the process of graphing in the new one. Thanks for all of the support you large group of strangers. It has helped me personally being able to just read through and update you guys. 

Edit 5: The surgery was a success, the only side step was having to reroute some parts of his bowel. The surgeons feel very good about the procedure, I'm just waiting for the nurses to let me into the PICU. I'm sure all of the realism will come rushing when I actually see my son, incision, wires, and all.

Edit 6: What a roller coaster these past few days. Just extubated!

Health,I get sick with a cold almost as soon as I leave home. Can I realistically do something about it?,"Let me start by saying that I'm in my early 20s, fairly athletic with a low body fat percentage, have a great diet and exercise regularly. All those things should make my immune system as good as it can ever be, right? But still, it's complete crap. I work from home and have just moved to a new city so I don't leave it very often, but when I do I get the cold, which makes me feel like crap for a week. I know the cause is viral because I spend many hours outside but get sick only when I interact with other people.

I'm really tired of this and am suffering from depression because of it. I'm tired of spending all my time alone. You might think ""well, a cold doesn't kill anybody"" but how would you feel if you had to deal with that for 3/4 of a year? 

I've talked to many doctors but they've said that I'm perfectly fine, it's just my immune system that sucks. I've spent many years working on my improving my health and now that I'm the most physically fit person I know it's as bad as ever. 

I know that a solution could be to treat the symptoms but I'm simply tired of going to sleep with the constant threat of puking, the damn cough keeping me awake and the general weakness I feel all day. The only way I can feel good is to live on my own without interacting with anybody at all, which is no way to live in my opinion.

I, however, only have one spot on my ankle and another on my forearm.  Here are pictures:

I haven't had any bites in my apartment before, and I haven't had any since.  Could this be the work of one stray bed bug, or something else?  Any insight is greatly appreciated!",8.0,3,2013-01-05,PHARMA,0.026516901329159737,0.905853271484375,0.0676298439502716

I have been talking to doctors and had an EEG (2h after a seizure) but they don't know what's going on, maybe you can tell me. They suspect somekind of stress-related epilepsy.

It always stars with my surroundings getting really loud. basically rock-concert loud. It's everywhere. When I push hands on my ears even the ""ocean"" sound is incredibly loud.

Then everything begins to feel really fast! I mean I am typing right now. One letter at a time, single finger, and I'm feeling like I might as well be shooting a machine gun of keystrokes. When I slowly walk up and down my room I feel like I am running although I know that I am taking slow small steps.

I'm at 15min now, so this is one of the long ones.

When everything seems to speed up my arms get heavy. Especially my hands.

17min. It's over now. The heavy feeling in my arms is gone, I don't feel super-fast anymore and the noise ebbed down. It went away as fast as it came, but not instantaneously but too fast to really notice.

Usually I get these when I'm working (hence the stress-relation that the doctor suspected), but sometimes it seems to be random, like today.

Anyone here who might have an idea what's going on?

This time my arms and legs not only feel heavy but a little thicker. My computer's cooling system seems to be as loud as an airplane. But that might be exaggerated.

I don't know what the cause might be. I was just surfing on reddit and suddenly things felt different and I noticed my computer getting louder. Then my clicking and typing felt too fast. As far as I know there is nothing personal or business-related that is stressing or even just concerning me.

Health,Questions about pneumomediastinum.,"Alright, so a little background first.
I'm a 19 year old male (6' 155 pounds, pretty healthy) and last thursday I woke up in the middle of the night a bad chest pain whenever I inhaled, making it somewhat difficult to breathe. I went to the ER and they diagnosed me with pneumomediastinum, but didn't know the cause (it could have been from smoking marijuana, but I hadn't for about 3 days so they didn't think that was the cause.) I went back in for another x-ray to see if the air bubble was getting smaller or bigger (and at this point I had no chest pain), and they said it was stable, but I am going in on tuesday for a follow up check up. Now, I have a couple of questions (which I will be asking my doctor, but I just wanted to get an idea of what the answers will be)
1. Will I be more predisposed to this now that I have already had it?
2. They said the bubble was stable, but how come I didn't have any chest pain even though it stayed mainly the same size?
3. Should I not smoke marijuana anymore to prevent this from happening in the future? (I could stop doing this or move onto edibles, but I do enjoy smoking)",6.0,4,2013-01-06,PHARMA,0.055885642766952515,0.8993071913719177,0.04480712115764618

Health,"My doctor has no more answers, what do I do now?","I have experienced kidney pain for over 30 years (since I was 8) and was always told I probably had kidney stones although usually there was any conclusive proof. In the last few years my pain increased to the point where it felt like I was passing a kidney stone 24/7. Even after eliminating any sign of stones, the pain continued. Finally, out of desparation, my urologist tried draining a 3cm perirenal cyst and to all of our surprise the pain went away. Completely. It was quite the miracle to not only feel better than I ever have, but to finally feel like there was a solution. 

I have gone five months without pain--until a couple weeks ago. In the last two weeks the pain has returned to the level I was feeling before (about the same as a kidney stone). The problem is that my CT scans show the cysts have not returned, there are no stones, and there is no indication of hydronephrosis. My urine labs show no abnormalities. Today I got that dreaded call from the doctor saying there is just nothing he can do for me. 

I'm fairly certain the pain is originating in my kidney (although I know abdominal pain can be deceptive). I am also fairly certain this has to do with my urinary tract due to painful urination, significant hesitation, and an aching feeling after urination. What is most frustrating is that draining the cysts did help but now there only a few tiny cysts so that is no longer the solution I thought it was. 

After suffering for almost a year in pain I was at a very, very low point in my life. The pain almost ruined my marriage, prevented me from working, and caused me to lose all my desire to live. After suddenly having my life back, I am completely terrified of returning to that point. 

So my question is, what do I do now? Do I go from doctor to doctor until one finds the answer? Do I scour the country looking for that one specialist who has some new theory? Do I accept the fact that the medical community has no solution for me and just learn to live a life in pain?",12.0,9,2013-01-08,PHARMA,0.08401478081941605,0.8766793608665466,0.03930583968758583

Health,"Been to the doctor, Out of Ideas... Shine a light?","LENTHY POST (My apologies!)

So, I'm not taking anything folks post here as medical advise or anything. I created a reddit account finally because of the situation I'm in, and I am not really sure where else to post this kinda thing. I have been to a doctor and still regularly go.

The doctor does not think I have Lupus. I have a Malar rash. My scalp has been flaking for the last ten years -- I'm 23 years old. My malar rash flakes as well, the skin will turn hard and almost like sandpaper if I don't wash it off every day. When I do wash it, literally, layers feel like they come off. I come out of the shower brighter than a red balloon.

I must constantly focus on not touching my face because it is always itching.

Doctor took a blood test, and he was very dismissive. I quote him when I say ""I am 99% sure you do not have Lupus"". Oh, the doctor is a dermatologist.

This is a relief, but what in the heck is this? Psoriasis?

I'm using hydrocortisone inoquinol (spelling) at this time. Hydrocortisone has usually helped in the past, but for the past week it does almost nothing, which is what has driven me to post on here.

Skin feels like I'm constantly walking through spider webs, to illustrate it for you.

Last question: I use a very small amount of hydrocortisone 2.5% cream on my face daily, usually less than a pea-size amount just on the malar rash. I've used probably less than one small size tube in my whole life (small tube is about half the size of a toothpaste tube). Hydrocortisone has side effects from what I've read... how much is too much use?

pharmacy,Working Hours / Labor Law Exceptions?,"Hi Pharmacists of reddit.


I was wondering how / if labor laws pertain to retail pharmacists in the sense that they can only work a 40 hour + overtime(unless salary contracted) work week, or even have a limit as to how many hours a shift can last per day.

My girlfriend is a salaried FT pharmer and works at a large retail pharmacy (DR, CVS, RiteAid, one of those) and she works 10 hour shifts (Scheduled) but stays for 12-14 a day sometimes, with **no time for lunch / bathroom breaks.** Now as a normal person who works a 9-5(6 or 7) job, I can't wrap my head around the fact that she works this much and doesn't even get a 5 minute break to do personal business or even eat a fucking snack, it's really frustrating hearing that she doesn't have the time to maintain her own health during work hours.


Please /r/Pharmacy. Help me out with this and give me some insight as to your experiences and dealings with retail pharmacy or any pharmacy with a similar experience/story.


Thank you!

medicine,Questions about the weight gain side effects of some medication,"Hello Meddit!

I have been thinking about side effects of some medication and more specifically the weight gain that a lot of people experience from certain medications. 

For example, for someone who is on Seroquel weight gain seems to be a rather common side effect with the risk of developing diabetes in the long run.
 Where does the weight gain stem from? Is it hormonal, a lowered resistance to stay away from to unhealthy food, does the medication make the body take up more of whatever fattening substances the food consists of or does it just make you more hungry? 

I tried to google but the results was most stories of people who suffered from this side effects, at least I couldn't find anything specific explaining this side effect.",26.0,8,2013-01-11,PHARMA,0.05392180010676384,0.91839200258255,0.027686195448040962

Health,So... hemorrhoids.,"[warning: gross/graphic]

I was often constipated as a child, and as a result started developing hemorrhoids in my late teens. Once I figured out what they were and how to treat them, they weren't an issue, and life continued, though in all honesty I probably should have seen someone about them because once or twice they got pretty fucking bad. Anywho, I treat with sitz baths, ice, and creams/wipes when I get a flare up.

The other day, while at work, I got a strange ""this isn't right"" feeling. That itching feeling you get with them--I've never experienced it before with any of my hemorrhoids, but I instantly knew what it was when I felt it. Came home, and now I'm confused. This is unlike any I've had before. The ones I normally get are soft, they basically feel like a thrombosed vein, I guess, and it's around the ring of the anus and they either go back in themselves, or occasionally I have to reinsert. Not that big of an issue, they shrink quickly and life goes on. This is small, about the size of a pea, and hard. I tried ice and a hot bath last night, and the prep H cream I use. When I woke up, I thought it was gone, but as the night went on I started to feel that pressure again. 

Any ideas on how to treat this? I need to get back to my doctor, as she did give me a surgeons name but I can't for the life of me remember, but I just mean in the mean time, until I can see her.

Please talk to me.","**DISCLAIMER, this is a long post, I am sorry for that. I had a lot to type, and I just really needed to vent, and see if anyone could give me some advice. ALL advice and all comments are appreciated.**

Before I get into this, I am an 18 year old male, I am 6'0 and 250 pounds. I am about 50 pounds overweight and have a really bad diet. 

Since I was as young as 5 years old, I have had a pretty bad digestive system. I have always had a bowel movement every 3-4 days and a lot of the time I have always had to strain. I went to the doctors for this when I was younger and they told my mother I had an abnormally large colon and it was nothing to worry about. Fast forward to last year around February and that is when my symptoms started. 

I noticed that I was having an extra long bout of constipation and I had not gone to the bathroom in about 5-6 days. Keep in mind I have never in my life regularly gone to the bathroom. I finally decided to take a laxative and about 12 hours later I had a bowel movement. The bowel movement seemed normal until I wiped... I seen A LOT of blood... It was not black or tarry but there was a lot of it on the toilet paper and it was bright red. Throughout my life I have always gotten a little bit of bright red blood on the toilet paper but never to the point to where it looked like my nose got busted open.

I freaked out and went downstairs and told my dad, and he told me it was most likely a hemorrhoid because he has them too. I believed him but me being the worrier that I am, I started to look up constipation with blood on the internet and start to find that it was a symptom of Colon Cancer. I was very scared. This was all last February. 

Fast forward 4 months and now we are in June. I have not had blood since February but I have still been very constipated and have started to use suppositories every few days in order to have a bowel movement. All is good until I started to get dull sharp pains all over my stomach but mostly on my left side. My stomach was bloated, I had gas pains, sharp pains, and cramps. It is was not unbearable pain, it was just a pain that was annoying and with my anxiety, it made me think the worst and it still does to this day.

I scheduled a Doctors appointment because of these pains, because I seen a lot of blood on the toilet paper for a second time, I also had a pencil thin stool, and also developed a swollen purple bump on my anus.

I went to the doctor, she said that it was a hemorrhoid, and she thinks that my stomach pains were the result of IBS. She did blood work and it came back fine.

After that appointment I still had the pains but I mentally felt fine due to her saying it is something minor like IBS. The pains went away shortly after the appointment and did not return until 4 months later which would be this December that just passed. 

Keep in mind, these pains are on and off, tend to be worse when I eat greasy food, and sometimes go away for weeks at a time.

The pain returning was scary enough, but I also have recently noticed that I have a lot of small (pea to marble sized) rubbery bumps all over the upper left side of my abdominal wall. Kind of by the bottom of my left rib. When I lay down or bend a certain way, I can actually feel some of them click against my rib. Think of the sound of when you push a jar lid down and it pops back up. That's what it sounds like.

I have another doctors appointment scheduled for the 28th, but with this last year being nothing but stomach pains, constant constipation, anxiety, depression from spending my days worrying so much, I am very worried about what could be happening in my body to make this happen to me. 

Has anyone ever had any of these symptoms and it turned out to be nothing that is too serious?

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for advice (more info inside).","* Just over a year and a half a go i was watching a TV show about health and bodies and such. There was a piece on testicular health and a demonstration about checking for lumps, so naturally i gave it a go. At first i didn't notice anything but when i checked again the next time i was in the shower and i found something. I read a bit about it and found that it could be a number of things aside from testicular cancer. So i ignored it.
* About a month passed and i started getting a dull ache in the testicle that i noticed the lump in, but i convinced myself i was just imagining it because i didn't want to go to the doctors and seem like a hypochondriac. As the months passed the dull ache began to become more frequent, but i still kept convincing myself that it was nothing. 

* Roughly 6 months ago during a period of the dull pain i experienced an excruciatingly painful shooting pain that seemed to spread from my testicles to my rectum and faintly across my stomach. This lasted only a split second then it went away. I guess what worried me most about seeing a doctor was that some times i couldn't find the lump and some times i could, which made me wonder whether or not it was actually there at all.

* Coming closer to present day the dull pain comes less regularly but the shooting pain happens more, some times i'll be mid-conversation and have to stop everything i'm doing because of the pain. On top of this, I've found blood in my stool that seems to coincide with the times of the shooting pain but only small bits.

* Finally today there was a lot more blood than usual and i have booked an appointment to see my doctor on Friday.

I don't think I've had a fever (don't own a thermometer; it is 0 degrees outside here so I didn't feel like bundling up and trekking out and make my breathing more difficult) but I woke up sweating today.  I started to feel a lot better last night just before bed, but I just woke up thanks to my rapid heartbeat and I feel crummier than I did yesterday morning.

Due to the fact that I moved very recently, my primary care doctor is about an hour's drive away this morning; I don't have anyone to take me and I feel very weak; I'm a little concerned that I could fall asleep on the drive.  I don't want to go to the hospital unless it's absolutely necessary as I know they're flooded with influenza cases...but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little scared.

Based on the above info, would you recommend I go to the ER?  Or should I just wait it out and keep drinking water and resting?

Thanks in advance.

**Edit:** Thanks to everyone who replied!  I worked up enough energy to go to the store and get some Gatorade and a thermometer.  Turns out I have a slight fever (100.2).  I got some Mucinex with acetaminophen, guaifenesin, and phenylephrine, but so far all it has done is bring my fever down a little bit -- it hasn't stopped the (mostly dry) cough at all.  I really don't want to miss any more work, but if this keeps up I'm going to have to trek out to my doctor's office tomorrow :/

Thank you for all your input!

**Edit 2:** To clarify: I am a lady.  With the exception of the asthma, I am generally healthy otherwise...with the exception of the last year in which my stress level was incredibly high and as such I got sick with a cold each month.  Tightness in my chest is fairly common for me when I get sick; it's been almost four years since I've had influenza, though, so I was probably being overly cautious.  Since I took the tablets (Mucinex of some variety) my fever has disappeared.  They're only supposed to be effective for 4 hours and it's been almost 6 so I think I'm doing okay, but I'll be re-checking my temp throughout the night.  I've been sucking down Gatorade like it's my job; I'd been drinking a ton of water but I was surprised at how dehydrated I still was.

I've been sleeping/resting a lot which I think has helped.  All in all, my first illness without any family members nearby has not been catastrophic, which is good enough for me to consider it a success.

I'm rambling now because I'm exhausted and a little nutty with cabin fever, but thanks for all the replies and advice.",15.0,9,2013-01-14,PHARMA,0.1626458317041397,0.8077427744865417,0.029611429199576378

Health,Had some seemingly unrelated symptoms after unprotected sex in Philippines.  Found an EERILY coincidental account of similar symptoms in an old post in a health forum.  Now I'm very worried of disease either gotten from the sex or travel?,"About 3.5 months ago, I traveled to the Philippines and had unprotected oral sex.  Nothing particularly abnormal has appeared on penis (a couple of discolored spots appeared but I believe they are scars from friction burns). However, I've had a persistent scratchy throat for 3 months, itchy skin/rashes scattered over body for unknown amount of time (very recently noticed a patch of tiny goosebump-like blisters on arm that were filled with small amounts of fluid), a persistent deep left chest pain (which I suspected at first to be musculoskeletal in nature) for 1 month (this chest pain is usually not present in most positions, but it hurts sharply when I put my left shoulder at a certain angle). 

I've simply assumed all those symptoms were unrelated and unimportant.  But that changed when I read this post:  http://ehealthforum.com/health/small-clusters-of-bumps-t169739.html#axzz2HwfY65Km - last post on that page by ""DJ321"". 

The coincidence is incredible. DJ321 traveled in Korea and Philippines.  I am Korean and live in Korea most of the time + I've traveled to the Philippines.  DJ321 had unprotected sex with a Korean then a Filipino girl. I had unprotected oral sex with a Filipino girl.  Symptoms in common: 1. scratchy throat at exact same location 2. chest pain, seems to be very similar (3. cluster of tiny blisters 4. white spots on back of throat 5. blood blister in mouth that popped and went away.) I feel like 3-5 could be common enough things that probably can happen to everyone.  But 1-2 bother me greatly. I find it so hard to believe that these can be mere coincidences.  I have a strong suspicion that even if I went to the doctors (which is actually hard for me in my situation), they would only test for common disease and not really try to figure out what exactly is going on.

Health,"I'm 28, and have a history of digestive/bowel issues. I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis after a colonoscopy. Should I be worried?","Hi all,

For as long as I can remember (even back when I was a little kid), I've always had extremely bad gas and poor bowel habits.  During my teens, this ended up being diagnosed as IBS.

A couple of years ago, I found traces of blood in my stool a couple of times, and my GP recommended I get a colonoscopy 'just to be safe'.  The results came back clear, apart from the fact that there is evidence of medium-level Diverticular disease.  My GP shrugged it off and just told me to 'eat more fiber'.

A couple of years on, I try and stay quite conscious of my fiber intake, however around every 3 weeks or so, I will just be literally 'blocked up'.  It's just intense constipation that's only relieved after a couple of days of drinking metamucil non-stop that eventually relieves it.  Some days it feels like I can't even pass gas properly because the blockage is that bad (if that makes sense).

After doing some reading, I can't find anything to suggest that having Diverticulitis at my age is normal whatsoever.  Everything I read suggests that it's something that only old people get.

Is this something to be concerned about?  Is having Diverticulitis at a young age evidence of bad things to come in future?  It just seems really strange to me is all.

I mostly work weekends and make my own schedule, just started this fall.

I've been emailing him checking in for past two weeks with no reply, so I called and apparently he is no longer with the chain.

I talked to the tech and it seemed that it wouldn't be much of a problem for either her to give up 4 hours or to put me on leave temporarily, so she asked me to call back tomorrow to work out the schedule.

pharmacy,Pharmacists and techs! Are these patterns prevalent with Suboxone users in your area?,"I am simply trying to determine if these are general issues other people have had to deal with in the pharmacy, and hopefully gain an understanding as to why.

I am a tech with almost 2 years of experience. I worked in a retail setting for a while and then moved away to a different school for a year. I came back and got my old job back, but several things had changed: Lortab and Xanax were not the common thing - suddenly everyone is on Suboxone. Prior to my move, I had only filled a few prescriptions for it over a year. I come back, and suddenly, it appears that 30-40% of the cusotmer base is getting it.

I live in an area that deals with prescription drug abuse frequently. However, unlike filling Lortab and Xanax often as I used to, I noticed Suboxone users tend to be...different. I see common behaivors to the point I can guess that they are picking up Suboxone, and have always been right. This disturbs me.

In instance one, there is a patient at the counter. Normally, people stand in line behind them. Suboxone customers tend to stand BESIDE them at the register, and stare at me. Now, when a customer asks what they have that is ready, I don't want to tell them they have Valtrex and Viagra when I don't know if the person standing next to them is a stranger or not. This happens around 80% of the time when someone is in line for Suboxone. No customer privacy whatsoever.

Calling. I would say the majority of calls I answer are about someone telling us to get their Suboxone ready. However, most of the time, they are outside in the parking lot when they call. Also, they tend to have others pick up the medication for them. Not only that, 50% of the time they are on the phone and make a damn drug deal right in front of me. However, as this is retail, the sale matters more, as I am told. I would estimate (where I live, anyways) that 2 out of the 30+ patients that receive this medicine are actually trying to break away from the substances they were originally addicted to. The rest make sales in front of me, which pisses me off. This leads into the next issue.

I see these people several times a day. Now, this area isn't know to have sufficient access to 'real"" drugs. Still, I should not see the same patient - 1. Daily, and 2. Multiple times in one day. I should not see you on every shift I work, much less 2-3 times a shift.

They come in pairs - Since many tend to have no issue talking in front of the pharmacy, it appears that the party that does not have a prescription is often the driver and buyer. Often times, they are given permission to pick up the medication, often leading me to believe that they have simply given money to pick up the suboxone from the other person.

They know the price of their medication and tend to have exact change. It is understandable since they are here, buying it then coming back an hour later for more. However, handing me exact change, rolled up in electrical tape and such gets suspicious. This isn't something I am bitching about, it is just another thing on the list of common things I see. Even the customers that are clockwork, knowing what day they are out of X drug dont come in with exact change. Something about suboxone always ends up without having to break a bill. Always exact change, everytime.

I'm not looking down on anyone here. I am merely wanting to know if other places outside of this region (SWVA) deal with the exact same thing, and if anyone happens to know why. If you or your friends do this, inform me! I'd like to understand this. I want to know why people stand next to customers at the counter and stare at me, why they have exact change, why I see them several times a day (I dont want to assume dealing, but hey, I see it often in this field) and why they call so frequently, and are in the parking lot when they call. I don't know exactly how this stuff affects people, but I can easily state that I don't see this with people on other substances that I deal with on a day to day basis. I don't want to continue asking why, I want to understand it.",18.0,8,2013-01-20,PHARMA,0.09672124683856964,0.8801857829093933,0.023092953488230705

Health,Severe itching when body warms up,"Hello

I have had this 'condition' for a good few years now. Whenever I do any kind of physical activity, whether it be running or even just walking uphill, walking into a warm room or even if I am slightly nervous, my body temperature rises, I can feel it, but the problem is, I start to get extreme itching all over my body. Like a tingly prickly feeling, on my head, face, back and chest. There is no rash present during this time. The only way to subside the itching, is to either cool down, or bear with it until I begin sweating. Once I begin sweating the itching goes away almost instantly, but then I am really sweaty and hot at this point.

Its almost as if the body can only not sweat at all, or sweats lots, not in between. However, if I do sweat a lot after bearing it, I will be fine for a few days and sweat like normal, after a few days though, it all starts again.

I do suffer from slightly dry skin that is only noticeable after coming out of the shower, I use small amounts of moisturizer on my face only, which seems to help with sweating if I am honest. 

I should note that no one in my family has this problem, and there is nothing in my medical or my family medical history that should be worth noting.",13.0,7,2013-01-21,PHARMA,0.062408965080976486,0.9030124545097351,0.03457855433225632

pharmacy,Rationale for formulary benzodiazepines,"I work almost exclusively with obtaining prior-authorizations/formulary exceptions at a psychiatric clinic and we have been bombarded with temporary supply letters for benzodiazepines since the start of 2013.  This has been a relatively painless process so far (aside from the tedious nature of it), but one PBM in particular is making this difficult. WindsorRx has rather strict guidelines for approving coverage compared to other PBM's.  

So far most of these requests have gone through other PBM's with ease despite them preferring some benzodiazepines over others and the non-preferred options have gotten approved.  WindsorRx on the other hand prefers diazepam (and one other I can't recall off the top of my head) over lorazepam and will not approve without relevant information documented in chart notes as to why the formulary options can't/won't be tried.  While I can provide this information most of the time, it seems absolutely absurd to have this requirement when all of these drugs are in the same class and are multi-source generics of roughly the same cost to the insurance. 

So my question is, what could be the rationale for WindsorRx to prefer diazepam over lorazepam, so much so as to deny the initial request despite the patient being stabilized on the lorazepam for over 2 years when, like I stated above, they are in the same class and roughly the same cost?  I understand the concepts of drug formularies/step-therapy etc, and how usually they are in place for cost-saving and/or safety measures, but this one has me puzzled.  I've asked a few of the providers at work but they also are at a loss so I'm wondering if any redditor pharmacy folks may have some insight.

I am a 24 year old female who just started having sex for the first time 5 months ago. My partner and I have been tested and are both STD free.

At the ER they gave me a shot that was supposed to decrease the inflammation that my cervix had undergone, along with a few other antibiotics. They gave me Macrobin pills for two days and Phenazopyridine for a week. Now that I'm off the antibiotics, yes I feel somewhat better, but the burning is still there off and on and it's quite concerning. My question is, am I still supposed to be feeling this after all the antibiotics I have taken? What else should I do? 
 I'm especially upset because I'm leaving the country soon for 3 months, and I do NOT want this feeling. 

Second question, what do you think caused it? The only thing I can think of is a possible allergic reaction to some intense condoms/lubes that we've tried like the fire and ice/yours and mine lubricant.
Your advice is appreciated.

pharmacy,Dutch Pharmacist here. How come the USA has such a big problem in drug-shopping addicts?,"It seems to me as if a big portion of a pharmacists work in the USA is to cope with addicts looking for opioids, benzo's or other illicit drugs. 

In the Netherlands this is hardly a problem. If a pharmacist notices overuse of benzo's/opioid's without a proper indication he will contact the GP (or any other organization which supplies the prescription), ask him to invite the patient over for a consult and not hand out the medication (or hand out for 1 week or sometimes even 2-3 days, telling the patient to seek medical advice from a GP/psychiatrist). It's even the case that if a patient hands over a forged prescription, they will contact the ""prescribing"" doctor and other pharmacies in the area to have them be aware of the patient. This also happens if a client steals a prescription block from a psychiatric healthcare organisation.

So I am curious. Is my view of the American patientfield skewed or is this really a major problem. It seems to me as if 1/20 patients is a pillshoppper, visiting different GP's, scoring as much Oxycontin on 1 prescription as possible and then go to different pharmacies with copies of that recipe? Am I simply ignorant of these kinds of problems because of how the Dutch healthcare system is trying to catch these drug abusers and trying to get them to kick off?

Health,My body is so sick that my mind is starting to make an exit strategy. Xpost from /r/Suicidewatch.,"Someone from suicide watch suggested that maybe you guys could help me because no other doctors will. I don't even care if you're a regular person who has the same thing, or a person who works as a secretary in a med center, or a person with just a new idea for me. I won't sue you or get angry if you're wrong. I'm literally imagining ways to kill myself so any possible advice or guidance at all would be great.

Original Post from /r/SuicideWatch[1] :
-----

This started four years ago. I was nauseous every time I ate food. When I went to see three different doctors, they wrote off my symptoms as being psychological. This led to a year of suffering and useless anti-anxiety pills. I would have great moments of pain that everyone thought was psychological. One of these left me screaming for help for 10 hours straight before someone took me to the ER. There, finally, they realized my gall bladder sent stones into my ducts and that was why I had been so sick all the time. They rushed me into surgery and removed it.
No one said they were sorry about not believing me. And then, after all that, they continued not believing me.

While I do not get those awful radiating pains as much, I still have chronic nausea now and it's awful because I'm emetophobic. That means I have a fear of vomiting (and also nausea) and it also means that no one believes me when I say that I feel sick. Because when I say I feel sick, I'm already having a panic attack due to the feeling of sickness. So fuck me, right? 

So when I went back to doctors, hoping they'd believe me that something was wrong after they nearly killed me the first time, they again chose not to believe me. I was put on psychiatric medication. I do not take it. Because, fuck you.

So I'm nauseous every day. Remember the last time you were so sick you couldn't turn your head without fear of spewing? Yeah that's every day for me. Remember the last time you were facing a fear? Every fucking day for me, too. With emetophobia and chronic nausea it is as though I'm afraid of heights and tied to the top of the CN tower every single day of my life. And I call for help, and no one listens. So I stopped calling. No one gives a shit. 

My husband, a year ago, made me go to a new doctor when I would only eat 500 calories a day because I couldn't eat more without getting sick to my stomach. He took a blood test and said I was fine. Okay, then. If you only eat 500 calories a day people, you're probably fine. After this, my husband also stopped bothering requesting that I see doctors.

I lost my job from being too sick. That means I lost my health insurance. Yeah, I was so sick, that I lost my health insurance. It's kind of funny now that I'm a little more removed from the situation. I have agoraphobia now because, well really, would you want to go out shopping or to restaurants when you have a stomach bug? Probably not. My life is pretty much over. There's no help for my body so my mind is ready to call it quits. 

I'm not sure what to do about my husband though. He still cares about me. I've been trying to get him to stop caring by only hanging out in the basement and sleeping down there to give us some distance. This doesn't seem to be working on him. I think though that if he really cared he'd help me end this life of always being sick. It's literally too much to handle. Alternatively I'd love if a doctor would believe me and help me, but that's never going to happen it seems.

**Update: You all have helped me get stronger and pick up the fight again and I'm really grateful for that. I've talked to my husband and he's going to help me get to a specialist (GI) who lives in Denver and travels around this area once a month. I'll bring up some of the most likely possibilities that some of you have suggested who have had the same problem I have had. I haven't had suicidal thoughts since the idea of hope came back into my life some time yesterday evening. I'll see a mental health doctor at some point if the emotional symptoms continue when the physical symptoms have been taken care of. But I truly believe there is hope again for once in the past couple of years since I gave up on doctors helping me. Thank you all for your compassion.**

**Ambassadors of /r/trees - I have nothing against weed at all. My husband uses it for depression and it has worked miracles on him. It has given me vertigo/dizziness and that had increased my nausea. I'll attempt baking it into foods like some have suggested.

pharmacy,Insurance in the Pharmacy world (an international comparison),"So I've searched around and couldn't find comparison between the pharmacy-insurance co. dynamic in the United States vs. other countries.  I'm uncertain whether other countries have tiered healthcare in senses similar to the way we do, and I know that this provides us ""options,"" but the negative aspects really seem to runaway with all of the benefits it provides us.  My questions are below this demonstration of what I'm talking about. 



I find the insurance co. driven healthcare system in the US discomfiting, personally.  In the scope of pharmacy, I observe our pharmacists (I work as a tech) bending over backwards all of the time to work around coverage issues.



The instance that comes to mind was about a dad under Caterpillar insurance, who was nearly sideswiped when he discovered that his insurance policy actually *penalizes* some of its insured members when they fill at certain pharmacies.  Now, obviously this isn't always a big issue; in fact, numerous families have gotten quite skilled at trying to understand the exact niche that their insurance co. has placed them.  That being said, I don’t believe this is reason enough for us to abandon our father figure example either.  Let's look on.



The Caterpillar example has a few variables to it, but it in short led to him trying to fill a script for a Class II narcotic for the eldest child who was on her last (transdermal) patch from the previous script (filled elsewhere, I'm assuming); we would have to charge him an obscene amount for that generic (his policy completely excluded the brand name), and unfortunately none of the preferred local options, which would have charged nothing through his policy, had enough to fill the prescription.  I am aware that the promotion systems are continuously engaged in our healthcare system, but the act of penalizing a man for trying to work with a system that may have benefited him more based on proximity or whatever variables he normally manipulated is clearly hurtful to the patient, and seems blatantly driven by company politics.


My pharmacist, after calling all of the local Walmarts, (the preferred option) did in fact managed to find an intermediate that was only going to have a $15 copay for dad.  



It might not seem like much to make a few phone calls, but the whole affair took well over 30 minutes (it was late thankfully).  Considering that the business is saturated with phone calls for new scripts, transfers, and questions, vaccinations, and some biochemical analyses, as well as the traditional role of monitoring indications and contraindications for our customers, placating a customer to this degree isn't feasible. It especially reeks of yesterday's fish when everybody is painfully aware that the big pink elephant, representing insurance companies' mentality of “our politics first and our customers' health second,” is unashamedly waving a multicolored banner bearing the words ""Sucks for you"" around for all to see.



TLDR: Anecdotal evidence shows US insurance companies' disinterest in their customers' health being the cornerstone for their policies.   Pharmacists literally work to manipulate any variables they can to maintain their customers’ health at reasonable costs, but when it’s circumnavigating insurance companies, it really starts to open questions on the system’s foundations.



So my questions for the rest of the pharmacy world are:



How does your government handle healthcare, in consideration of the pharmaceutical aspects, and what about it do you think is really beneficial, and what do you think is completely detrimental?",2.0,4,2013-01-26,PHARMA,0.06923696398735046,0.9056968688964844,0.02506619691848755

pharmacy,Incoming pharmacy students: What I think you should do to prepare the summer before pharmacy school,"This goes out to those worried or futuristic students who are just now getting accepted, and preferably, students who don't have much experience actually working in a pharmacy. So, the question is: ""What exactly should I do to better prepare myself for the madness that is pharmacy school?"" I know this question gets thrown around a lot during the summer, so hopefully students utilize the search function when that time comes. 

 So, here are my 5 simple rules to preparing for pharmacy school: 

**1) Begin developing good habits.** This means STOP CRAMMING! (I know it's a little too late for this in summer, but you get the idea). If you are currently in school, try it out. Begin planning ahead. Keep a calendar and planner (if you already don't have one). More importantly, pick up a fun, long-term hobby. This can be exercising, playing a sport, dancing, singing, cooking, becoming a chest grandmaster, whatever! The point is you want to lead a balanced life in order to de-stress during the difficult times in pharmacy school. 


**2) Develop networking skills.** Since the job market is narrowing, it is important to develop relationships that will last you throughout your career. I am often told that obtaining a job after pharmacy school may not necessarily be due to merit, yet instead, relies more on the people that you know. Begin making the effort to meet new people. Practice remembering the names, and finding conversation. Ask for a facebook add, email, or phone number to stay in touch. These skills should help for when you actually do become involved in organizations and conferences in pharmacy school. 


**3) Find a mentor** Out of all of your friends and family, you have to be able to find a pharmacist. If not, go to a pharmacy and tell them that you are beginning pharmacy school. I know this may be difficult without an intern or tech license, but ask him or her if you can shadow or work. If not, obtain their contact information, and use them as a source for questions. Ask how the job market is, how to improve yourself, and how a pharmacy simply works. And who knows.. maybe after you get your intern license, they'll end up hiring you. 


**4) Learn your word roots.** Many times, students try to think ahead by wanting to get started on actual pharmacy school material. Forget about that! There is simply too much to learn, let alone by yourself. Something I found interesting in pharmacy school was the amount of health jargon in every class. I would even go on to say that medical talk is like learning a new language. My suggestion would be to memorize medical word roots. You can easily Google for a list. If you've taken a course like medical terminology, then great! Review your old notes. Once you've covered that, move onto generic drug suffixes and their corresponding drug classes. Once you've done that, move on to memorizing generic and brand names. Do this in order; I think the results will be astounding. 

**5) Plan a career goal.** By now, you should be able to answer the question ""Why do you want to be a pharmacist?"" flawlessly. Make sure your reasons are completely honest and true. With that, research the job market; KNOW your strengths and KNOW your desires. In short, try to pinpoint what you really want to accomplish in life as a pharmacist, and create a simple long-term plan with steps of how to get you there. You obviously won't know for sure what you want to do until you get your hands dirty, but taking these first steps can do wonders. 


Now, I could add much more, but these are the primary things I'd focus on without getting overwhelmed. After all, this probably is your most free summer before school, so ENJOY IT! What do you guys think? If you have additional suggestions, feel free to comment. 


**EDIT:** Just to clarify, I'm not trying to ruin anyone's summer. I only post this because some students, no matter how sane they are, do ask this before school starts. With the exception of shadowing/working in #3, you can easily enjoy your summer. 1) Picking up a hobby won't buy into your relaxation time; it's supposed to be fun. And chances are, you already have one. 2) ""Network"" at parties, bars, or hangouts. Simply, meet people and talk. Make friends. 3) You don't need to shadow or work, but I would still encourage you to find an easily accessible and personal resource for questions. 4) You can do this in 5-10 minutes a day, or you can take care of it in one week. You'd still end up having at least 2 months to yourself. 5) Ok, I will be biased in this one because I believe a well balanced, happy life needs a sense of direction. This is not a homework assignment. Re-evaluate why you want to be a pharmacist because if you end up hating your job or not being satisfied with the pay, that will be a life long burden. You can find something related to pharmacy that will make you happy in the long-run; and if not, there is still time to refuse acceptance and re-plan your goals. Aside from all this, there is no doubt that you will have enough time to get wasted every weekend, to travel out of the country, to bond with friends one last time, or to pursue a new skill you never had time to master before. I had a 3 month summer before pharmacy school to do all of the above, and I could have done 1-5 easily during that time. I'm just providing some suggestions, but thanks for the input!",20.0,9,2013-01-27,PHARMA,0.02700688224285841,0.9013065993785858,0.07168654352426529
