medicine,Has anyone else noticed an increase in young patients aggressively trying to get diagnosed with depression/anxiety?,"I've noticed a new and growing phenomenon in my clinic. I'm not a pediatrician but I do work primarily with a younger patient base aged 18-24 (because of my area demographics and specialization). And recently there has been an increase in younger patients, usually Generation Z, who come in for an appointment confident that they absolutely have either depression and/or anxiety. They'll bring a laundry list of symptoms and most of the time it doesn't pass the SIGECAPS muster or the criteria for any other diagnosable disease. Most of the time it can be explained by environmental stresses and relationship issues instead of a bona fide mood disorder. Yet they are *sure* they have it. Absolutely sure. And when I gently try to push back and suggest maybe it's more of a subacute behavioral problem - they get upset.

I've had kids bring me printouts of random blogs with questionable studies, or stories of Youtubers who self-diagnosed, etc. And they argue for 20 minutes with me about this. I've had one young woman get extremely distraught when I said I wasn't going to make a diagnosis of depression, and she yelled at me saying ""*You're trying to deny my lived experience!*"" Fortunately that one was an outlier.

I have no problem referring people to therapy, or prescribing appropriate medication when it is needed. But I will not be bullied into making a diagnosis that simply is not present. Yet in recent years, especially in younger people, there seems to be more pressure to formally label them as depressed. I don't get it.

Furthermore I do not understand why someone would want to be diagnosed with this disease in particular. I've never had to argue someone out of thinking they have bipolar or schizophrenia or anything like that. It's always depression or anxiety. Why would you want this? There are no societal benefits to it. SSRI's aren't addictive and don't sell on the black market. Why?

Do any other PCPs have a similar issue? Has there been any research or commentary done on why this is happening?",290,729,2019-10-03,PHARMA,0.1214107871055603,0.8515633940696716,0.0270258616656065

medicine,"People are adamant about how inconsiderate it is to expect free services from friends in creative jobs (like designers, architects), business owners, etc. How about medicine?","Hello, reddit. English is not my native language, so excuse any typos or innacuracies regarding medical terms. 

The title expresses a thought I had a while ago, when I joked with a friend of mine who's an architect that she'd help me design my room someday. She answered something about her prices, which I found completely reasonable. But this got me thinking afterwards.

I have treated her many times. Just last week she called me with strong abdominal pain and nausea and I explained the possible diagnosis, recommended some medications for her and asked her to keep in contact along the day to keep me informed.

I treated her family members a handful of times, too. She even created a group in Whatsapp with other two friends who are also physicians because her father was ill about a year ago (I don't remember specifics, but it lasted a few days) and she used it many times since then when her at least 3 family members got sick (that I can think of now).

None of us ever charged her a penny for this. A couple of days ago, another friend commented how she was feeling kind of anxious. I offered her to come to my house so that we could talk and see if the had some anxiety disorder and possibly prescribe something. I didn't charge her. These are the most recent situations, but there are many other examples just like them in my still very short career as a physician.

I see a lot of posts on social media going on about how you should value the work of your friends, normally those in creative industries, and how offensive it is when you expect them to work for free just because you're a friend. I see it especially often with graphic designers (oh yeah, I've seen one of those for free, too). I understand the sentiment, but I honestly never thought about charging a friend for anything, and they have never, ever offered to pay or given me some sort of thank you gifts, either. Considering how the consultation is often time-consuming, the actual responsibility that comes with every word and prescription from a physician and how demanding the investment to become a doctor is, I really can't see why someone who thinks that designers should not work for free wouldn't apply the same rule for doctors.

He tells me this is his second episode of unilateral epistaxis and has a history of rinitis and adenoid removal five years ago.

His physical is unremarkable. His BP is at 130x90.

When he had the first episode he came to the ED and a doctor here did what he had to do, screened for coagulation defects and referred to the otolaryngology as an outpatient. He did tell him about the borderline BP.

This patient then proceeds to scheduling a cardiologist because he thought his BP was high. 

And he went to the worst cardiologist I can think of.

As to why I'm mad:

This kid comes today with a briefcase of exams. This cardiologist made him do:

Ergometric Stress Test.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 24h

Holter test 24h

Echocardiogram

Full blood tests, including ambulatory troponin (I'm like whaaaaat?)

medicine,"PCP Clinics, how does yours operate?","Just curious on how other PCP clinics are ran, the one I'm currently scribing at isn't operating that great due to the following things:

- Throwing walk-ins on the schedule without telling the PCP + double booking.

- Allowing patients that are significantly late (&gt;30 minutes) to be still seen.

- There is no charge for paperwork (FMLA, disability), they do it during their regular visit on top of discussing their chronic and/or acute issues, but I know some clinics charge patients $20-30 out of their pocket.

- No text-based communication system for scheduling, refills, etc. Even if 25% of patients preferred using it, that would cut down significantly on the amount of phone calls the front desk receive.

- Staff is very inefficient, I try to teach them ways to be quicker using Epic, but they go back to their old habits.

- There's supposed to be a limit of no-shows before they get discharged, but this isn't strictly enforced at all.

After scribing for a year now at an IM clinic, I would be content in that field if I owned my own clinic and hired competent employees; the above problems I've listed seem to be mostly due to the staff and physicians not really enforcing their own rules.

Before any outrage in the comments starts, this is just a jury decision. Jury decisions can be very disconnected from reality, especially when the defendant is perceived to be of ill-repute (ie the pharma industry). J&amp;J will appeal this and it will either be reduced to a fraction of the jury decision or thrown out entirely as damages have already previously been paid out. I'm not a legal expert (medical science doctoral student) but iirc there is a limit around 50x of damages as to what can be paid out as punitive damages. J&amp;J have already paid over $600K in damages to the plaintiff. An $8 billion punitive damages charge is EXTREMELY out of proportion and would be considered incredibly high for a class action suit. This is just to one man experiencing comparatively mild side effects.

Edit: It's also worth noting that the medication was used off-label during the plaintiff's childhood for autism.

pharmacy,"Another pharmacy school decides to profit off their students, compete with their alumni","[This publicly-traded company](https://www.tabularasahealthcare.com/trhcs-sinfoniarx-to-provide-enhanced-clinical-opportunities-to-community-pharmacies-through-innovative-partnership-with-drake-university/) has made a business out of contracting with colleges of pharmacy and setting up student-run call centers to deliver services to patients on behalf of PBMs and health plans. The colleges of pharmacy push students into these call centers as part of their IPPEs/APPEs and generate revenue from the students' work- free labor!

I'm all for students getting good, hands-on experience while they're still in school but these colleges of pharmacy are using students to deliver clinical services to patients who could otherwise go to their actual pharmacist to receive these same services, and taking a profit! I guess if you cannot meet your budget goals through enrollment, you might as well grasp at any dollar dangled in front of your face! If I were an alumni of one of these schools, I would certainly tell my Alma mater that this is a disgraceful practice. If I was in charge of a pharmacy or chain hiring new grads, you can bet I wouldn't take any students from these schools.

Of course this would only happen in the pharmacy profession... could you imagine the outrage if, say, a business school decided to open up their own for-profit tax filing service, staffed by accounting students, and started taking business away from their own alumni who are out in the real world trying to make a living doing tax filing and other accounting services?

Here's a (probably incomplete) list of schools now running these kinds of call centers:

Drake University

Ohio State University

University of Texas at Austin

University of Arizona

University of Florida

Creighton University

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: The comment section debate around ""how does 'free' labor in a college call center differ from 'free' labor at any other IPPE/APPE site?"", while worthwhile, is not the central issue I raised in the original post. The significant development here is, historically, the broader pharmacy industry hasn't had to think of Colleges of Pharmacy as potential competitors but, by standing up revenue-generating call centers, these pharmacy schools are very much putting themselves *in the game*. As such, pharmacy schools should expect to be treated as competitors by the broader pharmacy industry and be mindful that many of the partnerships they've previously depended on (experiential and rotation sites, hiring graduates, funding scholarships, etc) are being put in jeopardy.",87,135,2019-10-11,PHARMA,0.050483521074056625,0.9212751984596252,0.028241271153092384

pharmacy,Mental Health Stigma and Addict Shaming in the Pharmacy,"Something I have noticed in the pharmacy is that it is common for pharmacy staff, including pharmacists, to hold very ableist views towards mentally ill patients or secretly degrade patients picking up prescriptions like Suboxone behind their backs. I'm not saying that all pharmacists and pharmacy staff are like this, but I have seen this enough times at many different pharmacies to know that it is a significant issue worthy of mentioning. As a pharmacy staff member who battles bipolar type II disorder and takes psychiatric meds, some of the comments I have heard from pharmacy staff about people picking up psych meds makes me trust them less and feel less likely to seek the reasonable accommodations that I am entitled to by law. Many pharmacists and pharmacy staff have mental illnesses and take psych meds, some even may suffer from addiction. Before you go around talking crap about the person picking up their suboxone and going on rants about how their problem is a ""choice and not a disease,"" understand that the person you are laughing along with might also be suffering from the same thing.

I have had three major incidents at two different pharmacies that made me write this.

First incident was about 5 months ago. I was floating at a store, and a patient began to flirt with the pharmacist. As soon as the patient left, the pharmacist pulled up his profile and announced all the medications the man was taking to the other pharmacy staff. She then said ""I just wanted to make sure he wasn't taking any crazy people medication.""

Second incident was 2 months ago. A super nice patient was dropping off a prescription. She told us she used to work at a pharmacy and thought about coming and working at ours. Our pharmacist was ecstatic and told her to apply. But when the woman left and the pharmacist learned that she dropped off a suboxone prescription, she said ""oh no, never mind. We can't have her working here, she dropped off a suboxone prescription.""

Third incident happened yesterday. A 20-year-old girl was trying to pick up her suboxone prescription, but her insurance was giving us issues and wouldn't let us fill it. While she was trying to sort everything out, my pharmacist said ""she wouldn't even have to go through all of this if she didn't make poor decisions in the first place,"" and basically degraded her. The technician joined in with her.

We have a job to serve all our patients in a non-discriminatory manner and promote their healthy living. Judging them for being proactive and getting their medication is not a way to help them better themselves, and as people who work in healthcare we have to be sensitive to cultural needs and other needs of our patients.

This is your friendly reminder that ableism towards mentally ill people is not okay, and that addiction is a disease. Even if addiction is influenced by personal choices, things as simple as being over-exposed to painkillers in the hospital can cause someone to suffer from addiction and others don't grow up in the best situations. Further, multiple scientists and psychologists have come to the consensus that addiction is a disease. So please treat these patients with respect because they are just as important as patients with physical illnesses.

Joking about needing a xanax or something is one thing, but to actually degrade and humiliate people for their illnesses is completely wrong.",141,196,2019-10-13,PHARMA,0.11068406701087952,0.8620071411132812,0.02730880305171013
medicine,New report reveals shortage of hospital doctors in rural areas,"New report reveals alarming shortage of country doctors

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/13/nhs-consultant-shortage-rural-coastal-areas?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard

This is from the UK, and says that hospitals are not able to recruit attendings in rural areas, coastal areas (unlike the US the coasts are the deprived neglected areas) and post industrial towns and cities.

Although I don't want to go into any 'middle grade' discussion it was interesting that the US seems to have similar issues.

In the UK in a rural area you would usually have a GP in a village, so maybe half an hours drive, and a hospital in the town which won't have all the specialities but do the basic medical and surgical stuff, with an ED. The hospital might be up to an hour away, typically. But people want to work in larger cities.

In the US or Oz, much bigger countries, I guess a shortage of rural docs has more impact.

How many hours drive to see a doctor elsewhere? Is it like 3 hours in rural US? (Based on my watching of Fargo...)

I understand the US and Oz has extra money for rural docs, maybe we need that.",105,72,2019-10-13,PHARMA,0.025630580261349678,0.9038482308387756,0.07052118331193924

medicine,"ER Docs, what would you like your psych colleagues to know?","Just finished a CPEP (psych ER) shift. How it works at my hospital is that patients brought in to the CPEP are evaluated by a psychiatrist. If we feel there's a medical concern that can't be treated by us, we transfer to the main ER for medical treatment prior to admission or transfer back after stabilized.

We tend to have a good relationship with the ER doctors (mostly because they're overjoyed that they don't have to deal with any psych patients who present to them lol) but yesterday was a bit of an issue.  

When I came on to shift, the psychiatrist coming off told me incredulously how much push-back he got for transferring a patient with 200/120 BP to the main ER. He was convinced that this required workup to rule out stroke or other major issue. I didn't argue with him (he's an attending, I'm a resident) but my understanding of the literature is that asymptomatic hypertension wouldn't be treated in an ED anyway and so it was actually a completely pointless transfer. Long story short, I quickly accepted the patient back after he left (they did no workup in the ED other than restarting home meds which is completely reasonable imo) and things are fine.

My question to you guys, however, is what things like this would you like your psych colleagues in CPEPs/PES/PEC's to know? This is the first time I've run into this but I'm sure that attending has transferred many patients to the ED with asymptomatic hypertension.

Often, they only come to see you at the behest of their wife.  The ones that concern me are those with seemingly minor complaints, or that brush off symptoms most other people wouldn't.

I recently saw a 60 yo gentleman coming in with a few days of lower abdominal pain.  He told me he was otherwise healthy and hadn't been to the doctor in almost 10 years.  He had some mild diarrhea but no vomiting, no fevers, no other concerning complaints.  He was mildly tender on exam in the LLQ but otherwise stable.  I thought he likely had a gastro or mild diverticulitis, and recommended he go to the ER since it was late Friday afternoon and any workup we did from clinic wouldn't return until after the weekend.

He ended up going to the ER the next day, and had some labs that showed a WBC of 13 but otherwise normal.  He had an abdo xray that was normal, and was discharged, presumably with the same diagnosis. 

Today, he came back to clinic, mostly frustrated that they made him wait and ""didn't do anything"" at the ER.  I reassessed him and was concerned enough to do a more urgent workup.  I even phoned the radiologist at the nearest hospital, and she was able to get him in for a CT later this afternoon.  

The findings caught me off guard.  He has peritoneal carcinomatosis, multiple enlarged intraabdominal lymph nodes, several irregular liver masses, and ascites.  Possible cholangiocarcinoma primary.  

I was very much surprised by this, and unfortunately I think this came off in my delivery of the bad news to the patient. 

I recognize that this is probably going to cloud my judgement and cause me to over order tests for the next while.  But I can't help thinking, what if this was my father, who is roughly the same age as the patient I saw today (and hasn't seen a doctor in probably 20 years).

Lately I've had a huge uptick in calls specifically from Walmart. They always ask the indication for pain meds and whether it is acute or chronic. I've also ran into their self-imposed limit to match MME recommendations and requests to decrease dosing frequency.

This has, on multiple occasions, lead to delays in the patient obtaining their prescription in a timely manner. 

As we print most of our scripts, we don't know where the patient is going to fill them.

I'm curious where the first request is coming from and how it works in your practice. Do you need acute or chronic to bypass something in the system? Do you need indication to bypass something in the system?

With it being flu season, my DL (much like everyone else's probably) has been non-stop hounding every store about meeting their arbitrary flu shot goals. Our store is currently below goal, along with a majority of other stores in the district. Our DL has apparently decided to implement intimidation tactics after this weekend and sent the district this message:

If by Thursday you are not tracking to achieve target for the week your store will need to do the following: 

1. Call on ALL Tamiflu scripts from last year and fax me the results of these calls.
2. Call 10 local employers to set up flu clinics

If you miss goal for this week as well, you and your pharmacist partner will need to set up a flu concierge table at your store the following Friday and Saturday. There will NOT be payroll for this and will be an expectation for you.

pharmacy,Weird experiential learning policy?,"Hey guys.  Quick question about something that came up recently.  Wondering if any of you guys have experienced it.

I've been invited to precept an APPE rotationfor a school of pharmacy I don't usually precept for.  In reviewing the documents, there's a sentence that states ""It is the policy of (school) not to compensate preceptors.""

Now, I'm fine with that; none of the schools I precept for compensate me directly.  But they do issue a payment to the hospital that employs me.  Precepting fees help my employer offset the cost of my salary and benefits.  So I have no problem with not being paid directly, cause I get paid indirectly.

But then when I contacted the school to get clarification on some things, they said their policy is not to compensate the institution either.

The obvious question is: why would anyone precept for a school that doesn't pay for their students to be precepted?

The second obvious question is: why are the P4 students paying tuition, if that tuition is not being used to pay the people and institutions who are actually teaching them?",36,31,2019-10-21,PHARMA,0.08723625540733337,0.8869605660438538,0.025803187862038612

pharmacy,"Left three letter hell, moved to an independent and I couldn't be a happier CPhT","I posted this in r/pharmacytechnician , but wanted to share here for other techs as well.
 
For years I've heard how wonderful independents were compared to corporate owned chains. After the first few I applied at said they didn't offer insurance or benefits, I stopped applying. Divorced mom, 3 kids, I needed some kind of benefits. I was Lead at CVS for 4 years, a tech for a total of 7 years. The past 6 months have been the worst I've ever had at my job. My CVS is in a small town, but one tech and one RPh, all day long, trying to fill 200-300 scripts a day was impossible. We were staying late every night, arriving early every day and when we did catch up, the next day we'd be red again in QP by at least 99 scripts. Our DL has never worked a day in the pharmacy and kept giving gem advice like 'you gotta do today's work today'. I got word that the independent across the street was hiring. I'd talked to their RPh regularly for transfers and such. He was more than happy to hire me. Today was my first day, and it was nothing short of amazing. 3 techs plus a cashier and 1 RPh. The company buys the staff lunch every Monday and stocks the fridge with the staffs favorite drinks for free! I never felt rushed, never had a patient get rude, never had a drive thru to get, never had to beg patients for carepass or a discount card. I even got to sit when doing data entry and Pioneer is a breeze compared to Rxconnect. I got off at 6 and still had the energy to take care of stuff when I got home. I cannot remember the last time I was this happy at my job. I can never remember actually being a CPhT and being able to do my professional duties without being stressed! I will never return to 3 letter hell again!

Day 2 was equally as great. I get to do all the things my state and national cert allows me to do (compounding, counting narcotics, recons, etc) instead of CVS restricting me based on their own rules.

So on this particular day I was working with a floater who was a little slow. I was working non-stop, running around the pharmacy trying to do everything before the pharmacy closed. Making sure to meet flu shot goals, doing PCQ, drop off, pick up, 14 day, production, phone calls, cycle counts, and cleaning the pharmacy but unfortunately I wasn't able to finish half of my tasks with the floater. 

The next day, I get a text from my pharmacist listing out everything I missed but it wasn't like i was sitting on my butt and chilling in the break room enjoying life! I was so angry that I just didn't respond. I felt like I worked so hard and I was exhausted after my shift and then waking up to a text basically implying that I suck at my job was like a slap in the face.

medicine,PSA: You can restrict the AMA from releasing your information.,"The AMA keeps a Masterfile on virtually every physician in the US, even those who are not AMA members. It contains information on your education and training, your state licenses, your NPI number, and your ECFMG number (if any). It releases this information to credentialing services. More information is here:

https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile

Normally, the AMA will release this information indiscriminately to anyone who requests it. If you want your Masterfile to be released only with your permission, you can fill out a Do Not Release or a Do Not Contact order with the AMA.

More info here:
https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ensuring-physician-database-privacy

You can also restrict pharmaceutical reps from accessing your prescribing information by registering with the Physician Data Restriction Program.

More info here:
https://pdrp.ama-assn.org/PDRP

More information on the PDRP and how the Masterfile is used to obtain prescribing data:
https://assets.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/dbl-public/x-pub/pdrp_brochure.pdf

The Do Not Release order adds one extra step to getting credentialed, but it is not difficult. A lot of credentialing services, accustomed to being able to access physician profiles freely, were baffled by my Do Not Release order - indicating to me that shockingly few people have taken the time to enact these important privacy restrictions.

I encourage all physicians to learn more about these restrictions. My personal opinion is that everyone should have orders like this in place. Our personal information as physicians should not be as freely available as it currently is. At the very least, the AMA should advertise the options more openly and be more transparent about how it uses the data of all physicians - even those who are not AMA members.",33,463,2019-10-24,PHARMA,0.048159439116716385,0.9296379089355469,0.02220265381038189

medicine,"With the transition to HMOs and Managed Care Plans, the workload of a typical doctor's office has exploded. What are things you do to make the work more reasonable on your office staff?","I am a private practice, operating with a partner who has his own EIN and insurance contracts. We share the rent and office staff costs. 

Much of the time, I am wondering about how overworked and stressed my staff is. I want them to be happy and to work efficiently. I don't know if I can push them a little more, or if I need to take something off their plates. Will hiring someone else make my job go better? 

If I didn't have school loans, this would be a less stressful thought process. But I know I need to run a monetarily efficient doctor's office. But on the flip side, I know I am pushing them so there will be more money in pocket. This adds stress for me, because it's selfish vs selfless conceptual conflict. 

It's just what's in it for them? A workplace needs to be a partnership. They understand they will never make as much money as me. But I need to treat them like partners. So recently I asked my actual partner if we should start discussing bonuses at the next monthly meeting. He seemed up for the idea.

**What I'm getting at is, what are some things that have worked for you in getting your office more efficient, happier, and less stressed?**

Recently, our big concern has been trying to reduce time on the phone. The staff doesn't like being on the phone constantly. No one likes being put on hold while having to juggle 1-2 other tasks. Our office is 3 people at the front (with an 8 hour work-day), and they were on the phone for a combined 12 hours (I can track it, the line is digital). 

It's mind boggling how much time they are on the phone. I just don't know what to do. Has anyone had any success here??

Anyway, sorry for the long rant, TLDR: Workload is very high in the office, and I am searching for ways to treat it effectively.

Thanks for your time!",30,88,2019-10-26,PHARMA,0.05645815283060074,0.9147472977638245,0.028794560581445694
pharmacy,"I Made The Jump to Hospital Pharmacy, It Isn't Any Better","Retail sucked, for all the normal retail reasons. I did it for years before trying to move on.

I worked at a PBM and that was hilariously mismanaged. They ran their staff out the door with their incompetence and are basically constantly hiring new people to match the turnover (though, they use a staffing agency that knowingly sends them idiots and people that have been fired from previous jobs for behavioral problems) I don't miss that place, even though the pay was better and having my own cubicle was nice.

So now, I finally got into hospital pharmacy and it's the same old shit. The staff is disgruntled and jaded because workload has been increasing with no increase in staffing. The pharmacy itself is hectic and crazy with people being pulled off of important tasks mid-shift because someone called off (it's hard to listen to everything, but it seems like there's call-offs every day) The understaffing is a purposeful decision by management and they appear to be hiring an army of part-timers who can't build up enough hours to be eligible for benefits, instead of bringing on normal full time employees and offering them benefits (saying that now, it seems like this place would be a perfect target for the staffing agency I mentioned)

Understaffed, overworked, and (if I stop being optimistic) no opportunity for advancement.

There's only one other major hospital in the area and, based on the stories, their hospital is run the same way.
