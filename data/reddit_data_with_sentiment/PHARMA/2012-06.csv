medicine,A question about Advil/Ibuprofen,"I was just wondering if anyone has any insight to share about the different Advil products available, and if there really is a difference or if it is mostly marketing. Read on for my specific example.

Sometimes I take Advil after playing soccer as I find it helps reduce pain I sometimes get in my leg muscles and alleviate any swelling. I ran out of regular Advil (ibuprofen 200mg) so last night after my game I went to the store to pick some more up. I bought some regular advil but also found a product called [Advil Muscle &amp; Joint](http://www.advil.ca/en/products/327/advil-muscle-and-joint.aspx) and since that's what I normally use it for I bought some of that as well.

My question is, is there any difference between normal advil and this muscle &amp; joint advil (besides the m&amp;j pill having 400mg ibuprofen vs. 200mg in regular advil). Is this ""special"" type of Advil just a marketing gimmick or does it actually do something different specifically for muscle &amp; joint pain?

My legs were sore yesterday but today they feel pretty good after taking the M&amp;J pill last night, so I don't know if this is a placebo effect or the medication actually worked quite well for me.

Thanks

Health,"What's wrong with me? I think I'm actually sick, but nobody can find anything wrong with me. I'm not looking for solid medical advice, I just want opinions to present to my doctor.","Okay, so first of all, I know I'm a fool for asking for medical advice from reddit.  Thing is, I've been asking doctors, and that doesn't seem to be working.  So I'm going to ask more doctors, but before I do, I want some options I can present.  I've googled, I've looked at WebMD, I'm really just clueless as to what's going on.

Also, I'm not a hypochondriac.  I rarely go to the doctor, except lately.

Here's me: Early 40s, Male, Morbidly Obese.  No personal history of heart disease, cancer, etc (some family history).  Blood work all comes back clean -- slightly low HDL (24), slightly high Triglycerides (174).  BP usually around 137/76.  Non smoker.  Recreational drinker (6-7 beers a week).

My symptoms: Pain.  Pains coming up at various points in my body.  Regularly.  Not crippling pain -- I can function (though sometimes it crosses that threshold).  The pains I get:

* Lower left side/abdomen.  Just at waist height.  Stabbing pains that come and go daily, throughout the day.  Sometimes affected by my position, sometimes not.

* Left side.  Bottom of my rib cage.  Sometimes sharp, stabbing pains, sometimes dull pain.  Comes and goes throughout the day.  Occasionally appears on the right side, though not frequently.

* Left armpit. Sharp stabbing pains.  Comes and goes.

* Left of front of chest, in my breast (on either side of my left breast, not usually in the center).  Sharp stabbing pains, they come and go daily.  Less frequently in my right breast.

* Just center left of chest (about an inch to the left of center, about an inch lower than my nipple).  Sharp stabbing pain.  Feels like it's in front of my ribcage, not behind it.  Another frequent daily occurrence.

* Occasionally these pains in and around the chest area produce panic attacks.  Ever since the clean bill of heart health, I've been able to beat those down and not obsess about it, but I still occasionally get those weird cold chills that run through my body and I get a bit dizzy.

* Headaches.  Oh, my god, the headaches.  They feel like tension headaches.  On both sides, running from my temples to just behind my ears.  Occasionally also in the back of my head.  Less frequently around my eyes.  Used to be rare, now they happen multiple times a day.

In March I was diagnosed with diverticulitis, and two recent CT scans show it to be healed.  I have a colonoscopy scheduled for next week.

I've had various tests done on my heart, including echo, EKG, nuclear stress test, holter monitor, event monitor.  Nothing was shown except for the occasional pre-atrial beat.

My GP says I'm too comfortable for kidney stones.  A sonogram last year showed small gallstones (I'll be having my gall bladder removed when I go in for gastric bypass surgery later this year).  About 10 years ago, I had an acute pancreatitis attack that resolved on its own (I was admitted, but it went away without treatment).

So.  Anyone have any ideas?  I'm all ears.  (That's not a condition.  I'm only approximately 2% ears.)",23,4,2012-06-01,PHARMA,0.20821860432624817,0.76317298412323,0.028608372434973717

Health,Suffering from migraines - any advice?,"I come down with migraines about once a month, and they last anywhere from a day to a week (currently suffering from one now, which started four days ago). 

Symptoms wise, it's a pain usually on the right side of my head, nausea, incredibly sleepiness, light sensitivity, tension in my neck and jaw, and general feelings of wanting to curl up and die. 

Went to the doctor's, but she just prescribed me some triptans and told me to try figure out the triggers. No further advice. Am keeping a diary, but so far, I can't figure out any one thing that's a common factor.

Health,"Had this pain problem for over 10 years, doctors not sure what it is, any thoughts?","I've had this bizarre medical problem for over 10 years, and can't find a solution. Thought I'd see if anyone here has any insight:

* intensely painful sensation in right side/lower to back of hip .. sort of deep inside.
* often preceded by lot of noise/growling in stomach
* often preceded by what i can only describe as mental confusion/anxiety
* I lose appetite, face goes white, and i am in agony and unable to do anything until it goes
* Some temporary relief in a very hot bath, some relief from a heating pad
* I have tried many medications, none help. Basically, when I get it, I cancel all plans for 24 hours, and go to bed. 
* I've had ultrasound, barium x-ray, about 10 years ago, nothing abnormal

Now, this is gonna sound strange, but the only relief is to go to bed with a heating pad set to “burn me” and large amount of booze, and often that will make it go away in 8 hours or so. But this is unreliable, messes up my schedule, is terribly unhealthy, etc. There has got to be a solution!

The closest thing to a diagnosis is that it is “some kind of IBS”. 

I've had a lot of painful injuries in my life, but nothing is worse than this thing.

Health,"All growing up I had pretty major digestion issues, symptoms very similar to irritable bowel syndrome. At 23 years old I no longer have any issues whatsoever and it was all due to my diet. Hope this information will help others find relief.","Background information: 23 year old male, always have been skinny, fast metabolism, and never got checked out by a professional. What fixed my digestion issues was all through trial and error of my diet. I cut out sweets completely and after 3 weeks of eating clean, I stopped having any sort of digestion problems.



Any time I got any sort of nerves, I would get diarrhea. The intensity and duration of the diarrhea directly correlated to how nervous or stressed I was. This was a major issue in highschool. I hated eating breakfast when I had a big test in the morning because when I would get to school, I would most certainly get the runs. A couple times after lunch at school, during the last class of the day, I would get the runs when the teacher would pass out our test - thank goodness they believed me and let me go to the bathroom and take the test later. I noticed that I usually got the runs when I got nervous/stressed after I ate sweets, so I started making sure to avoid sugars before any sort of tests at school, and yes this helped most of the time, but if I got extremely nervous or stressed I'd still have issues. I would choose not to eat anything before major tests thinking maybe I'm allergic to something I'm eating but I would still end up getting diarrhea at school. This was an issue taking girls out on a dates, college exams, and sometimes big hw assignments I would almost always cause diarrhea.



I noticed more often than not, if I ate dinner with a soda I would have issues after eating a full meal at a restaurant. I started solely drinking water with my meal. However, if I ate dessert after a full meal at a restaurant, I would sometimes get diarrhea. I thought okay I can't have dessert after I eat a lot. These observations over time and experimenting, I drew the connection that sweets/sugars were causing the  issue. I ended up changing my diet and started eating less and less sweets, ended up cutting it out of my diet completely. I noticed that after about three weeks of not eating sweets that my digestion issues started to subside to eventually nothing. I ended up slowly incorporating sweets into my diet (sodas, desserts, candy) throughout the week, and low and behold I started having issues again. I ended up testing this theory 3 times and every time my results were the same. If sweets/sugars were a part of my diet, I'd have issues. After a few weeks of not having sweets/sugars a part of my diet, I wouldn't have issues. What I learned from experimenting is that it takes a few weeks of eating sweets/sugars before I have digestion issues. I can eat sweets occasionally and not have issues, but if it is a consistent part of my diet, my digestion is out of whack whenever I get nervous or stressed. It's like my body slowly builds up with something over a few weeks that's causing the issues. So, What I have learned is that I can't eat sweets too often. Perhaps this information can help someone else out there who also struggles with this. It took me a few weeks of cutting sweets to notice a difference. I do eat sweets occasionally, but nothing like before. It took me nearly 20 years to to find relief, hopefully this can help other people who are struggling with this now.


**TL;DR I have/had what might be irritable bowel syndrome(?), I cut out sweets and sugars from my diet and now I have zero digestion issues. I can eat sweets and not have an issue, but if I eat it too often I have major digestion issues. I hope this information will allow other people some relief who also struggle with this. If you have any questions or insight, I'd love to hear them.**



**Edit: I forgot to add that late into highschool my parents had me try DGL Licorice by Solaray (though I believe there are several companies that make this), it was the only thing that alleviated the pain and diarrhea at the time.**",22,61,2012-06-03,PHARMA,0.1146833673119545,0.8596625924110413,0.025654077529907227

Health,Anyone here have any tips for hypermobility? I'm so tired of being in pain all the time and never getting better...,"I have hypermobility - basically all my connective tissue isn't as strong as it should be. When I move, everything cracks and pops (neck, shoulders, hips, etc). I get random dislocations pretty often. If I try to carry something too heavy in my hand, my shoulder will just pull right out. If I try to run, my foot kind of falls out of its socket, so I don't run much. Lately it's been my collarbone, previously a rib, ankles, knees, wrists, everything really. It's always painful and often it takes weeks or months to get better, and then it's always something else.

The worst was several years back when I slipped a lumbar disc. No inciting injury... I was just driving a car and it went. It's been about 5 years and I still deal with it daily. It has improved somewhat over time, but that specific spot in my back hurts most of the time, and my lower back tires out really easily. I suspect it's related to the constant hip pain I have as well, since it's all connected around the sacroiliac/psoas. 

I accept the fact that I was just born this way (so the doctors say). But what really frustrates me is that I do so much to try and improve, but I don't feel like I ever really get better. After my back injury, I did 2 years of physiotherapy, and have tried everything from osteopaths to chiropractors (in addition to traditional doctors). Massage helps, but only temporarily (and it's expensive). 

I was advised by health professionals that I needed to build core strength, and I have worked hard at that over many years. I'm pretty fit and do a lot of walking, pilates, and yoga (focusing on strength since I'm already hyperflexible). I can't do anything very high impact, though. 

Ironically even though I'm very stretchy, because certain muscles tend to overcompensate for connective tissue weakness, I also need to stretch a lot. I wear orthotic inserts in my shoes (podiatrist confirmed hypermobility causes my feet to collapse if I don't) and that helps a bit. I've tried every ergonomic implement at my desk at work, from back pillows to sitting on an exercise ball. I try to stand sometimes but my back gets tired and starts hurting. I took glucosamine supplements regularly for a long time, but didn't notice they helped at all.

All these things help a little, but I just never feel like I'm actually improving. I'm still in pain a lot and it's exhausting. Simple things like carrying shopping bags and walking up a slope (something about the angle) are extremely difficult for me.

My latest idea is that I should take up weight training and really focus on muscle weakness. I've come to realize that certain muscles have been overcompensating for years and I need to strengthen complementary ones, and hopefully stabilize a bit more. But I'm really worried about my form being slightly off and hurting myself, since everything comes apart so easily. I'm planning on taking a few sessions with a trainer at first to make sure I'm doing it right. But will weight training even help? 

What else can I do? I'm so sick of feeling weak and like my body is constantly falling apart :(",32,16,2012-06-03,PHARMA,0.10821928083896637,0.8533043265342712,0.03847638890147209

Health,Worried girl in need of some honest and accurate advice.,"Doctors of Reddit,
I am a 19 year old normal girl from Ireland. I have had chronic Hepatitis B since I was a baby; I most likely got it from my father as he is also a carrier. For the moment I am reasonably healthy, my liver has no scarring and my viral load is decreasing steadily although it is still there. I have recently started college and life is good!
However, one of my biggest concerns is how to tell people, mainly boyfriends, that I have Hep B. There is a lot of negative stigma attached to Hepatitis B, and as many people do not know much about the virus, it can be perceived as a ""dirty disease"". I am terrified that when I tell new boyfriends that they will react badly and think I am disgusting. (Thankfully this has not happened yet). I am quite shy and have low confidence as a result. I have recently met a new boy who is part of our group of friends in college. I like him and he likes me I think. (I do not mean to sound like a teen magazine agony aunt page, I am sorry)
 My reason for posting this is at what point do I need to tell a boyfriend I have Hepatitis B. Of course it is not the first thing I like to mention when I initially meet new people, I like to get to know them first. But it is hugely stressful and I feel extremely guilty during this period. The big issue is kissing. Is kissing ok? I have been told it is as long as there is no blood to blood contact. (I am not a vampire, nor is he, so this is good). I am just terrified I could put them at risk and I really could not live with myself if I passed it on to anybody. I do not want any person, especially this boy, to think I have betrayed them.
(Just to be clear, I wouldn’t ever dream of having sex unless the other person was fully aware of my condition and had started the course of vaccinations. I also ALWAYS use condoms.) 
This is my first time posting anything here, I’m sorry this was not very interesting, it is just causing me a lot of stress, but thanks a million for listening!",4,7,2012-06-05,PHARMA,0.06833010911941528,0.9005775451660156,0.031092338263988495

medicine,Before you become a doctor...,"I been reading posts from enthusiastic, bright-eyed students asking if medicine is right for them all year (usually at around 4:30 in the morning while I drink coffee during the only 10 minutes of free time that I have per day).  Before you all decide what to do with your life I thought I'd share some of the experiences that I had this year as an intern.  I am an internal medicine resident at a well respected academic East coast program known for its humanistic bent. 

Some typical experiences. I have...

-been over my duty hours at least 50% of the time, worked several 100+ hour weeks, been told to keep my mouth shut and me more efficient when I brought it up to my chief,

-stayed awake for six straight days on coffee and 5-hour energy drink because as a night float intern some attendings want you to be present for rounds after your night shift,

-had three separate co-interns endorse suicidal ideation in a single day and had at least one of those be serious (they lived),

-Coded three people in a single early morning, with crying family members in the room, and then got yelled at by an attending for not having my notes finished on time,

-saw a co-intern work with hourly vomiting/diarrhea (because the penalty for missing a day is to be placed first on the sick call list and this generally means missing 1-2 weeks of elective time), then place an IV in his own arm and give himself fluids while writing his notes at the end of a call day,

-been called to sub for a sick intern on my first day off in two weeks (it was a night shift),

-observed a co-intern who had 10 days off in a 4 month stretch of back to back floor months (post night days off count as days off),

-had a nurse not call me for a patient with active GI bleed until the tech noticed that their breath was shallow (Hgb 4.0),

-had a patient yell at me and call me some not-so-nice names for not giving him enough morphine after I recognized a silent NSTEMI on his telemetry and he had to undergo emergent cath,

Some funny things did happen as well. I...

-had a knife drawn on me by a patient in their room,

-had a patient leave the building to shoot heroin through their IV and then come back high,

-had a patient smoke crack in their room,

-had a patient's family member attempt to strangle another family member at the patient's bedside,

-had a constipated guy pass a poop as big as his head (he was a young man).

Health,Bristol Myers Squibb - Help Save our Dad - Petition to get experimental drug approved for compassionate treatment for 48 year old father of three.,"Darcy Doherty, a 48 year old father of three, is seeking compassionate access to a new cancer treatment in a desperate attempt to extend his life.  The experimental drug, BMS-936558, is in Phase 1 clinical trails at research locations in Canada and the U.S.A

Doherty’s oncologist, Dr. David Hogg, Attending Physician at Princess Margaret Hospital and Professor of Medicine at the University of Toronto, believes that his patient can benefit from this new treatment.  “Mr. Doherty had a fantastic response to the then-experimental immunotherapy drug, ipilimumab (Yervoy®), in 2007.  That drug has given him four years of life, and I believe that he may experience a similar benefit from BMS-936558.”

The manufacturer of Yervoy,Bristol-Myers Squibb whose Canadian head office is in Montréal, also produces this new drug.  The company has repeatedly blocked Cumming’s appeals for access over the past weeks explaining that it does not have a compassionate use program.

Health,Constipated for 6 months now..,"I'll just give you a quick run down:

I've been constipated for a while. I was barely having any bowel movements, maybe a week or so between. I never had an urge to go. I tried a high fiber diet for about a month, nothing. I was able to get in with a doctor around month 3, and she put me on Miralax to try and soften my stool so I could pass it. My stomach was beginning to protrude and it was hard. I've been on that for about a month as well. Basically, it just makes me able to have a bowel movement, but I'm still not passing whatever is stuck. I can FEEL it. I wish I could just stick a vacuum hose and suck it all out. She also recommended enemas and suppositories... which now don't even work. Nothing comes out, and it's horrifying.

Now, the situation is: I can't eat because my stomach has no room to expand. I literally eat a granola bar and am full for the entire day. I feel malnourished and fatigued. I am tired all of the time, I'll sleep for 10 hours and then take a nap during the day. I will have the urge to go, and I'll feel it moving, but when I sit down nothing comes out. It's like dry heaving.

What I think messed me up was I was taking a lot of multi-vitamins and eating protein bars without supplementing my diet with fiber and water. It may also be stress, but even so, with everything I'm on, I feel that it would blow it out already. 

I'm going to the doctor tomorrow and I don't know what the next step is. What are your opinions? Do you guys think that a strong stimulant laxative would make the difference? What about a colonic? Or a colonoscopy? Could I have any lasting damage to my colon?

Curious if anyone else has dealt with this and how, and what I should talk to my doctor about. 

If you guys want anymore details just ask, but I wasn't going to give out all the nasty bits unless prompted.


EDIT: Thanks everyone for your input. I have an appointment with a GI doc tomorrow and will stress the severity of the situation to her. Like Centech said, it's way past just trying a new laxative. I am definitely on board with getting a new doctor if my current one isn't showing enough concern. I'll update after my appointment for those who asked. Until tomorrow! 




UPDATE: So I saw my GI doc today, and she wants blood work to check my Thyroid, and a colonoscopy to see what's going on. I asked her ""what if my bowel doesn't completely empty?"" She said we can deal with that if it happens, but she didn't seem too convincing. I'm going to get the blood work this week, and schedule the colonoscopy for sometime next week. All in all, she didn't seem too overly concerned, but I guess I have to roll with it for now.",84,36,2012-06-10,PHARMA,0.11023978143930435,0.8628273606300354,0.026932798326015472

Health,I have a question about women's health,"I am 26f and am a child of immigrants. Health wasn't much of an issue around the house as none of the children (including me) ever really got sick. Women's health was even less discussed around the house.

To give you an idea, my mother gave me ""the talk"" when I was 21 years old and during the entire conversation it was talked about in circles and referred to as ""it."" When I was 17 I asked my mother to see a gynecologist for a regular checkup and was informed by my mother that I didn't need to especially because they'll ""use things and stick it in you."" Guess she wanted me new and fresh for any future husbands.

To this day, I've never visited a gynecologist and I've basically been prolonging it because it just seems awkward to start going now, but as each day goes by I get older and it gets more awkward to go. (Super irrational I know I know..). Lately though, I've been.. discharging(?) this milky stuff. It happens out of nowhere and at random times and I'm not exactly sure if this is normal or what. I will probably go see a health profession on campus some time this week, I just wanted an idea of what it is before I decide if I should panic or not.

medicine,Career Advice for a grad with a B.S. in Microbiology?,"I graduated May 2011 with a B.S. in Microbiology at a well-known state college, and since September 2011 I have been working as a lab manager for a bioengineering lab at an ivy league university.  I'm gradually being trained on molecular biology techniques so I may be of some use when it comes to research, though I feel research in general is not a good fit for me.


I'm considering a career as either a Physician's Assistant OR a Pathologist/General Practitioner.  The latter is more unlikely, you'll see why:


GPA: cumulative 3.14 (not great)

MCAT: 28Q (9 VR, 10 PS, 9 BS, Q WS; not bad, but not what I was hoping for)

GRE: 540 VR (156?), 650 QR (151?), 3.5 AW; took the GRE before it changed, only studied a couple days for the exam


The only clinical learning experience I had was through my junior and sophomore years of high school, where I shadowed pathologists, trauma surgeons, physical therapists, gastroenterologists, etc., but I don't know how relevant this experience is since it was long ago.


I'm currently looking for GOOD clinical opportunities but they are a bit hard to come by.. many positions are a bit menial, involve moving patients, greeting patients/family, being a scribe, etc.  Since I'm already working on PA and med school apps, I don't believe I'll have any time to include any clinical work within my application anyway.  I will be applying to many in-state PA and medical schools, and also a couple island medical schools like St. James and Ross.


I'd like to know what my odds are, I'm hoping I get at least one of these two careers (if I don't get either I'm really unsure of what to do with my life, I really don't want to end up being stuck with another ""gap year"" so to speak).

Health,"Reddit, I desperately need help with diagnosing my problem. (NSFW)","Hi Reddit. I am a 17-year-old from a small village in the south of Italy. I have got a problem in my man-parts, but I can get no help from the local hospital; it is a small health center with only female doctors. To get ""real help"", I need to travel quite a long bit and I haven't got too much money to spend, and I don't want my parents to know about my problems, it being rather embarassing and all. I have called various hospitals and described my symptoms and I have also visited several health websites, with no success. So now I am turning to Reddit, and hopefully there are some doctors out there or someone who has experienced similar problems!

So. About once every 6 months, I get white/yellow clumps accumulating under my foreskin. These clumps are rather solid, but I also get some kind of soft white/yellow-ish slime under my foreskin. I was thinking that this was smegma (did some research on Wikipedia), but I have not read that smegma can be solid, as in my case. 

When I get these clumps and this slime as described above, my glans also gets irritated; it gets sore and sensitive. My foreskin is also rather tight, I can not pull it all the way behind the glans. Is this why I get these problems, or is it because of some reaccuring infection? Worth mentioning is that I am also late in puberty, my voice hasn't dropped really yet and I also have very little hair around my genitals and in my armpits. 

So why do I have these problems? And what can be done about it? I have never had sex, but I must confess that I have masturbated several times, if that is the cause of anything. 

I am getting rather desperate and scared because of this reaccuring problem, and I have really nowhere to turn. It is also starting to affect my self-confidence.

Health,"Soooo...after 4 years of drinking, I've suddenly became allergic to alcohol.","This is crazy to be honest, I've never heard of this happening to anyone I know of, but I don't know if it's common or not.

I noticed it a few months ago after having a few beers (read: 2), but I thought nothing of it, because I was about to go out so I thought it had something to do with the clothes I was wearing and I was just read because I was hot in them.

Then the next weekend, after a glass of wine with my wife, my face broke out into what looked like hives.  I went to the doctors the next day and showed them pictures I took, and they basically said ""Yeah, you better just not drink alcohol.""  That concerns me a little bit, because I was hoping they would recommend me to go do blood tests or something.

After a month, I figured I'd test the waters again.  I took a shot of tequila last weekend, and almost instantly my face turned red and it felt like it was burning.

I have also noticed since this started happening, that I have been having a shortness of breath and my face has been red for awhile.  Today for some reason, it looked pretty bad and my skin felt itchy.  I realized that the skin cleanser I use in the shower has alcohol in it, along with the conditioner.  Today, I used mouth wash that I haven't used in awhile, and when I got home from work I saw that it is 24.7% alcohol (ouch!).

So I'm wondering, are there any other common things around the house that could potentially have alcohol in it that I should be aware of?

My wife uses more natural, organic shampoos, conditioners and body washes that I will start using, but I was wondering if anyone knew of any specific brands that focus in being 100% alcohol free?

Over the past month or so, I've increasingly been losing chunks of time and having no ability to account for what happened.  At first, I just thought I was being forgetful or I couldn't adequately gauge time, but in the past 10-14 days, I've been losing up to 4 hours at a time.  I would estimate that I average an hour ""gone"" every day, but some days and weeks are worse than others, and I'm not sure that I know of all of it.

During this same time, I've also had massive memory problems.  I've gone from having relatively average memory to being unable to remember important details such as my computer password, street address, or the names of my close friends.  However, these memory issues are cyclical - there are times I can log into my computer, but other times it's like I'm opening a computer I've never seen before.  I would compare it to a perpetual ""tip of your tongue"" moment, where I know I have a piece of information, but I absolutely CANNOT access it.

When I lose time, I generally only know because I'll be doing something (like playing video games) and then I'll instantly being doing something else (like cooking or walking around outside).  I've started wearing a watch and checking it regularly so I can estimate how long I've lost, but it's imperfect and I've mostly resorted to asking my roommate when the last time I did X (""When did I last play video games?"").

I have asked my roommate and friends about times they have seen me that I think I ""lost.""  All of them have indicated that (to the best of their recollection) I acted normally.  I can't find any consistent pattern for when I lose time.

I'm sorry I didn't post sooner, but needless to say it has been a hectic day.

I'd like to start off by thanking everyone who saw, upvoted, or commented on the original post.  I owe you my life.  I don't think that I can ever express the amount of gratitude that I feel for the support and concern of strangers who had nothing invested in the situation, and could have easily chosen to ignore the post.  It is because of you that I may be able to see my 20th birthday.

I explained the situation to a friend and she was able to arrange a friend of hers to take me to KC.  As per the advice provided, I skipped the ER and checked myself in.  Poking, prodding, and scanning later, I have a diagnosis:

I have a brain tumor.

I didn't really absorb the specific science-y details he went over, but he seemed optimistic that it might be operable, at least to remove some of it, based on where it is in my brain and other things.  I have been scheduled for a biopsy to determine whether it is cancerous, and I will post the results whenever I get them.  I'm not really sure about anything else that's happening at this point - I'm mostly just going wherever they take me and doing whatever they tell me to.

The doctor said that **I could have had an aneurysm at any time and died without any notice**.  He also said that, since I wasn't experiencing many noticeable symptoms that would specifically point to a tumor (like hearing and vision issues, seizures, or muscle weakness), it could have metastasized before I found it necessary to seek treatment.   Again, I could have died tomorrow had you all not expressed such pressing concern that I get help ASAP.  I don't know how I'll ever be able to repay all of you, but I want to make sure you understand how much this has mattered to me.

Health,I got bloodwork results from my doctor today...Regarding Leukopenia,"Hey guys.

Now, fast forward a month, and I get a thing in the mail. He wants me to ""schedule an appointment asap"" and the ""chief concern"" on the bloodwork form is ""Leukopenia"". Lower on the sheet it shows a checkmark next to ""CBC, Platelet Count, Differential"". 

I did some pretty brief research on Leukopenia and found [this](http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/symptoms/leukopenia/causes.htm), which kinda scared me a little bit because 90% of the things on that list are pretty scary....I scheduled for another blood test tomorrow and all that, but I was just wondering if any of you guys know anything more about the probability of the cause or what's the ""most-likely scenario""?

medicine,"Child Abuse Witnessed Domestically, Obligation to Report, Further Options and Resources","Yesterday I heard disturbing stories about my fiancé's cousin and the cousin's girlfriend, who have been abusing their two-year-old son.  The extended family, including a nurse, have witnessed these behaviors, causing them to disallow the cousin, girlfriend and child from visiting their homes, but no one has taken any step to report the abuse or to remove the child from the home.  I've offered to take the kid temporarily, which was dismissed.  I am giving this several days, hoping that the extended family will determine to remove the child from the home; they believe that foster care would not be an improvement, but I think they have their heads in the sand; they also don't want anyone to go to jail.

I haven't discussed this with my own family.  My dad's an MD and mom's an RN; without having seen these events, neither of them would hesitate  to call CPS if I told them what I know.  I am extremely frustrated waiting for my fiancé's family to take an active role in helping this little boy.  

Without resorting to legal recourse, what resources are available to address such a situation?  I suspect that the best way to effect a change in the family's response is to press the nurse's obligation to report known and suspected instances of child abuse; a sense of responsibility aside, no one wants to lose ones license.  Are there intermediates, specifically at a major university hospital, who could be called to persuade her to report the situation (if not to remove the child herself or with help), or would a third party just be obliged to report the scenario?",7,16,2012-06-20,PHARMA,0.11352043598890305,0.8628984689712524,0.023581119254231453

2) [As a follow up to #1] Do you think mid-tier practitioners will be replaced with PA or CRNA? If yes, why? If no, do you think mid-level **specialties** MD's/DO's will need to take pay-cuts?

3) Will medicine continue to be privatized or will the American people go full socialist?

Health,"Sudden, intense pain in wrist/forearm that won't go away. What the hell?","First I just want to say that I've read the medical information disclaimer.

Now, I'm a student and I have a job for the summer, which is to rip out damaged materials from an old and fire-damaged house. So yesterday I'd been working for almost two full days, with no problems, and just as I'm lifting the hammer from the ground, I feel this complete out-of-nowhere, really intense pain just above my wrist. I have no idea what caused it.

I have had no previous injuries to this arm. I'm certain that it's soft tissue damage, because I have no pain in the wrist joint itself. While resting, I barely feel anything at all, but supporting just the weight of the hand itself is painful. Moving the hand around is painful. It should probably be noted that only when the force on the hand is perpendicular to the length of the forearm does it hurt; when pushing or pulling the arm towards/from the wrist through the elbow, it does not hurt.

Also, when I move my thumb around I get this really weird vibration up my entire forearm (I have had other people feel this ""vibration"" too).

I've been taking it easy today in the hopes that it would get better. However, it only seems to fluctuate. One moment it's better, the next it feels as when I first felt it.

I'm writing a novel and one of my main characters is a woman in her early 20's and I need to give her a fatal disease that could kill her in 6 - 12 months. Her whole plot will be based on the motivation to find the cure/live and the novel stars when she finds out about the disease. The novel will have a fantastic element to it so she will (most likely) be fine in the end.

I did my research and couldn't find anything good, the only disease similar to what I'm looking for is the Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, but I think it's a bit too exotic for a young woman living somewhere in Eastern Europe. And I don't want to do cancer since it was done hundreds of times before.

So could you please help me with a disease that could fit her age and background? It could be something genetic or something she just got, doesn't matter. It has to be fatal with a max 1 year survival prediction though. The more hopeless, the better.

trying to google this, not having luck.

**Back story** : last night i got drunk, and smoked weed - which i rarely do.  i stayed up later than normal.

**Today** : i wake up and feel fine.  strangely fine.  up for several hours no issues.  maybe my heart skipped a beat once or something.  ride my bike to the store, get stuff, come home.  all is well.  i hadnt really eaten for the day so i snacked on some triscuts.

a few mins later im like instantly fucked up.  my face feels like there's pressure there + ""fuzzy"" (not numb) and i couldn't mentally focus for shit.  no other symptoms.  this lasted for about 10 mins.  i was able to walk around, do some work, etc etc.  took my pulse didnt feel fast or strong like my BP was high.  googled stroke symptoms and high blood pressure symptoms and it didnt really match.  after i felt ok i ran a test and ate some more tricuits, issue didnt happen again.

pretty confused about what just happened!

**edit** : about 1hr after walked .5 miles to cvs and took my bp.  it was 141 over 82, which is about normal for me after a night of drinking and not enough rest.

pharmacy,The story of Betty Dong,"I commented in the brand/generic thread in r/askreddit about the Betty Dong story and thyroid products, but it was buried way down and I figured it's more appropriate here :)

If you haven't read it before (I'm a new grad, so I hadn't read it until this past year), it's a very interesting story:
http://www.astrocyte-design.com/pharmaceutical/betty-dong.html
http://bioethics.stanford.edu/education/documents/Rennie_JAMA.pdf

Basically (copy/pasted my explanation from the other thread, so it's a very non-medical explanation)... 
Betty Dong was a strongly against switching patients from brand-name thyroid replacement products to generics, as she felt it would be unsafe. The manufacturer at the time (Boots Pharmaceuticals) of Synthroid (the brand name) wanted to gain a larger part of the thyroid replacement market share, so they gave her money to conduct studies to prove that there was truly a difference between the brand and generic. What she found, however, was that there was absolutely no difference between the two. As any good scientist would, she wanted to publish these groundbreaking findings and submitted it to JAMA - despite the fact that she had publicly been against switching patients from brand to generic. Boots pharmaceuticals was pissed, ended up threatening to sue her and all those involved. She was forced to pull the article at the last minute, and the pharmaceutical company started published other articles discrediting Dr. Dong in other journals... eventually the Wall Street Journal figured out what the company was doing, the FDA stepped in, and her results were finally [published](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9103344?dopt=Abstract).... albeit 5 years later.",15,12,2012-06-30,PHARMA,0.03274340555071831,0.9293450117111206,0.037911612540483475

medicine,Is the best way to learn in MS3 to focus on pattern recognition and memorizing decision trees?,"Greetings Meddit, just finished MS3 orientation, and I will soon start my first year of clinical rotations. I would like to know what you who have been through wards think of this overarching philosophy: excellence on wards will consist only of pattern recognition and knowledge of relevant decision trees.

This philosophy only concerns mastery of the practice of medicine. I know that there is an important social aspect to clinical rotations, and I intend to show up early, stay late, and communicate effectively with staff and patients. Also, I chose pattern recognition for lack of a more inclusive term. I am applying it both to activities like interpreting x-rays and ECGs and to the repetition required to correctly perform procedures. Decision trees would be for both diagnosis and treatment/management; I’m sure you’ve seen many of them. 

Am I missing something, or are these two modes of learning sufficient? 
To head off some anticipated objections- I don’t think critical thinking deserves the emphasis it ostensibly has in medical education, and I say that as a scientist who has spent a lot of my young career thinking critically, creatively, and abstractly. I think guidelines formed by professional organizations will usually be better than the opinion of any specific doctor, and that following guidelines would result in better care, on average, than relying on any doctor’s intuition or experience. 

Also, while I am interested in the underlying principles and technologies involved in generating data about patients, I don’t think this understanding has any benefit to patient care. For example, I don’t care how the location of different leads generates an axis on ECG, only identifying the axis and applying it in a relevant decision tree.  

TL/DR: Is the best way to learn in MS3 to focus on pattern recognition and memorizing decision trees?",26,7,2012-06-30,PHARMA,0.034555960446596146,0.9350947737693787,0.030349262058734894
medicine,Radiation Oncology,"I am considering a career in radiation oncology and was wondering if there was anyone who had gone through/is going through the medical school and residency process who wouldn't mind answering a few of my questions?
I am a nuclear engineering senior and would stay another year to finish up pre-medical requirements, take the MCAT, apply, etc. I am considering this and medical physics, and will have to stay an extra year to get into graduate school for either profession I choose to pursue. Time and money are not major factors, but quality of life and job satisfaction are.
I am doing medical physics research right now and it is very dry. I thought that using my knowledge of radiation to directly help human beings would be far more rewarding than sitting in a lab calibrating machines",11,6,2012-06-30,PHARMA,0.0277996938675642,0.9346030354499817,0.037597302347421646
