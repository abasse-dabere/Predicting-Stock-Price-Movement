medicine,Medicines perspective on Physiotherapy,"Hey Meddit, just wondering what your general consensus for physiotherapy is for the patients you treat. As a physio I get referrals from doctors for PT  which allows us to assess and treat what we are trained to do. However in some cases, but still all too often, I have very specific orders to what I should be prescribing from doctors that in instances is becoming clearer that it isn't evidence based, but more so preference (I'm looking at you incentive spirometry after CABG - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0012816/). 

My personal opinion is that in becoming a physiotherapist (at least in Australia) we learn enough to know our scope very well and where to refer on when necessary, but overwhelmingly we are trained professionals in prescribing exercise for the medical population. So thoughts on doctors prescribing physiotherapy to physiotherapists to give to patients.

(No intention to dig at doctors -  I understand that you have a much larger wealth of knowledge and experience over what I will ever learn but us allied health areas are here to help and take that load off in each of our respective areas)",52,34,2017-12-02,PHARMA,0.022743163630366325,0.9217928647994995,0.05546395480632782
medicine,Question about distributive shock?,"I apologize if this is not the correct subreddit for this kind of question, in which case I'd like a pointer to where I should post this..

So, distributive shock; what does ""distributive"" refer to in this type of shock? I think I have an understandig of it, but then I see videos or read stuff that contradict it without explaning why so I'm at a loss here.

This is what I've gathered:
Distributive shock is a type of shock (systemic hypoperfusion) in which the main problem is an abnormal distribution of blood within the intravascular space, due to systemic vasodilation. This generalized vasodilation, causing an increase in the circulatory capacity all the while the volume of blood remains the same, leads to ""relative hypovolemia"" with reduced preload. Damage to the vasomotor centers in the CNS, sepsis, anaphylaxis, and more, may all cause the initial generalized vasodilation. 

I also know that during sepsis and anaphylaxis, the capillary permeability is increased and fluids may exit the intravascular space and enter the interstitium. 

What I struggle to find an answer to, believing that all the above is correct (but I am happy to be corrected) is whether the loss of intravascular fluid into the interstitium is part of the ""distributive"" problem in distributive shock, or if this translocation is actually a type of hypovolemic shock, but we still choose to call eg. septic shock for distributive because the distributive problems have a bigger impact on the systemic hypoperfusion than the hypovolemia from fluid-movement into the interstitium?

I hope I made myself understood :) 

TL;DR
Does ""distributive"" in distributive shock refer to distribution problems WITHIN the intravascular space (eg. pooling in venous part) or to distribution problems BETWEEN intravascular and interstitial space?",22,32,2017-12-02,PHARMA,0.13226328790187836,0.8370700478553772,0.030666688457131386

medicine,Common medical phrases used by the general public that make you want to neck yourself?,"Maybe I'm just the kind of nitpicker that for some reason wants to throttle every white girl that feels bidden to explain to me about all the ""toxins"" in the world, but hearing the general public talk about medicine is a truly testing experience. Yes, I generally am always 50/50 about necking myself for no reason whatsoever because it would be a funny news article, but also yes, the worst is probably hearing all them bleat about how stupid doctors are and how nurses are the real heroes, but at least it's easy to understand how they are lead to believe that (I regularly have nursing propaganda pop up on my facebook newsfeed - ""how nurses save us all from doctors"" and the like). But some expressions for me just confuse the crap out of me.

The one I dislike the most is the expression ""having an aneurysm"". Makes me want to say, so when did you have this aneurysm? Did this one specific event that made you ""have an aneurysm"" send you a decade back in time and give you some specific vascular wall changes that lead you to gradually develop this aneurysm over the next decade just in time for you to pop it now? Or did you mean that you've had a pathological berry lingering in your 21 year old head for the last half of your life and you just now became so irritated that you decided to ""have"" it. Thinking about how stupid this common saying is makes me want to have an aneurysm.

medicine,For women residents/docs- a question on being taken more seriously,"In light of the recent allegations and high profile men being thrown from their positions, I had a question regarding sexism in medicine. No doubt, sexism exists. However, as a medical student female aiming for a competitive surgical specialty in a male dominated field, I feel that speaking out against bias/stereotypes/jokes will hurt my future career more so that help it. Change, I believe, starts at the top.

My main conerns as a female is simply not so much sexual harrassment (which I haven’t experienced, thank god) but being taken seriously. Despite my strong knowledge base, I often feel that my thoughts carry less weight than my male counterparts. So much of working with others in medicine seems to be not only about what you know, but also about how others perceive you. 

How have you women combated this? What changes have you made within the system to gain more clout/credibilty when others seem to doubt you? I have already thought of just being louder/more confident. But what other changes may be useful? For example, should I wear make up to look professional or will that give others the wrong idea? Is shorter hair better than longer hair? What about the tenor of your voice? How do you conduct yourself?

I realize that I really shouldn’t be asking the question in the first place. Women should not have to change their presentation to gain others approval. But I also believe that I can’t really enact change until I make it; so until then, what are some tips/tricks you have picked up along the way?

medicine,How do you all deal with the Absurd in medicine?,"Disclaimer: ramblings of an intern finishing up a 15 hour shift. 

There was a great article in the JAMA ""Humanities in Medicine"" section a few months back about the existential concept of the Absurd and its role in medicine. Camus refers to the Absurd as the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any. 

I see so much sadness and misery on even a ho hum day in my intercity, community hospital. I cling to my biopsychosocial understanding of health and feel privileged that I am more than a spectator- I can do something to help. I can mitigate and palliate at least some of the pain I see. But I struggle to make sense of the bigger questions that I brush off as ""just so"" all day. Why does a young woman get RA and watch her finger grow twisted and useless? How do I make sense of the alcoholic with no willingness to change? I see so much isolation and loneliness all day long. Why must they suffer so?

And then I come home to my quiet, well furnished apartment. On many days my loving wife has made me something nice to eat. I maybe do a few pull-ups and feel strong and young for a little while. Life is good. How is that fair? 

So, how do you deal with this contradiction? Religion? Nihilism?

medicine,"I'm struggling, and I'm scared. How can I multi-task better?","I'm a PGY2 in IM, and I feel like I'm still floundering like an intern.  I don't feel like I'm performing the way I should be. I really want someone to talk to, but I don't know who is a safe person in my program.  

I'm on a rotation now where it's just me and another PGY2 and medical students (no interns).  I'm essentially doing all the work of an intern and a resident (granted, with only half the team).  My program admits every day, and while my partner and I try to alternate admitting days, sometimes we just have to help the other one admit.  I'm having a difficult time organizing myself during the day when things get hectic, esp when I have discharges and admissions to do at the same time.  I can't multi-task well.  Once 3-4 things start happening at the same time, I'll start forgetting to do things, and I can't stay on task well.  I get side-tracked from higher priority tasks and don't realize it until later.

I'm afraid of my ability to eventually lead a team (which I haven't done yet based on how our program works even though I'm a PGY2).  My knowledge base is sorely lacking, and I feel like part of my inefficiency is from needing to look things up (doses, differentials and tests, how to interpret tests, etc).  I'm afraid of not being able to stay organized and making my team a complete disaster.  I'm afraid that I'm so behind in knowledge that I'll never catch up.  I know there's a lot to know in medicine, but I feel like I'm struggling with even basic things.  I did very well in medical school, but I feel like I'm one of those residents who is great at tests but actually a terrible clinician.

medicine,[META] Let's talk about subreddit content and moderation.,"Hi team,

December has rolled around which means it's time for another subreddit meta thread. This is your opportunity to give us any feedback or recommendations you might have to help keep this subreddit a high quality community. Our last meta post was themed about our new moderators who have really stepped up and provided a lot of behind-the-scenes help. This time, the moderation team would like to discuss subreddit content.

I would very much like a general consensus on the best way for us as a subreddit to approach 'inflammatory' or 'recurrent' topics of various sorts that comprise the bulk of our work as moderators. Specific examples might include posts about AI in medicine, chronic conditions like [CFS](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/73t52q/the_cdc_finally_reverses_course_on_treatment_for/)/[fibromyalgia](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/712pg7/lady_gaga_has_fibromyalgia/), [gender bias](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7f4xss/women_surgeons_are_punished_more_than_men_for_the/) [in medicine](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7al75u/is_sex_reassignment_surgery_ethical/), [midlevels'](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7dgup1/defensive_nps/) [roles](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7ftl73/nurses_to_the_rescue_freakonomics_podcast/) [in](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7et5rt/unqualified_np_in_the_practice_i_work_in/) [medicine](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/6mz7qg/this_is_why_there_are_building_tensions_between/), and AskMeddit-y style posts like ""[what's the biggest misconception about your speciality?](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7acizy/what_is_the_biggest_misconception_other_doctors/)/[what medical TV trope is wrong?](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7g7un4/what_medical_tv_trope_is_so_wrong_the_doctor/)/[what's a pearl you want everyone to know?](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7fnwf6/whats_one_factarticlepearl_you_wish_every_other/)/[what medical term annoys you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7dthxu/which_vaguequasimedical_term_annoys_you_when/)/[what's your pet peeve in radiology reports?](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7ckg9u/whats_your_pet_peeve_about_radiology_reports/)"".

Each of these topics is separate and probably has a distinct solution. However, these threads are similar in that they collectively tend to result in a lot of discussion, which is presumably good, but also result in [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7036uk/are_there_any_diseases_you_are_convinced_are_all/) [removals](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7fgkrz/issue_with_nursing_retaliation_and_a_colleague/dqbnzu7/), brigading, and unqualified anecdotes being thrown around as fact. To be fair, they also often spark interesting debate - posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7dx1ut/clinical_issues_with_the_radiologist_level/) in response to posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7dart1/radiologistlevel_pneumonia_detection_on_chest/) provide for fantastic discussion and debate and should be encouraged, in my opinion. There have been some critical and constructive suggestions in the recent past - see [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7et5rt/unqualified_np_in_the_practice_i_work_in/dq8yc5b/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/76rp5v/what_happens_when_you_have_a_disease_doctors_cant/dog9zv9/); for example, it has been suggested that we require all posts about a chronic condition to be from a flaired user (or indeed for *all* submissions to be from flaired users, though whether that will make any useful difference is debatable). We want this subreddit to be useful and engaging to users whilst retaining its relative neutrality, educational value, and objectivity, and we need to strike a balance. We often end up recycling these topics on a weekly basis leading to the same tired comments, the same throwaway accounts with hit-and-run vitriol, and the same end result of downvoting disagreement. We'd like your opinions and help brainstorming solutions on these topics and I'll give you mine as a separate comment.

The other side of the coin with subreddit content is a request for ideas, AMAs, and cases. Are you a professor of something that might be of interest to the community? Did you just publish an interesting study? Are you a specialist looking to give a little teaching to an audience of 150,000 people? We'd love to [hear from you](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmedicine) to work with you to take full advantage of the collective expertise this subreddit has to offer.

This post will remain stickied for at least a week and we'll try to reply to as much as we can. It would be particularly helpful if any suggestions, if possible, were accompanied by a link to a submission or a comment that illustrates the issue.

Please bear in mind that this is a community of over 150,000 people and this subreddit is moderated by a few volunteers with day (and night) jobs. Proposed changes should be both philosophically and practically acceptable and should take into consideration this subreddit’s target audience of medical professionals.

medicine,Dealing with a malignant attending,"Preface - I am a PGY6 in a surgical sub specialty - No issues thus far in training and have a fellowship next year. 

I am currently on a 3 month private practice rotation with a 70+ year old attending. He is an internationally known surgeon and has been published thousands of times. He would be name everyone in my field knows immediately.

The issue I have is he personally HATES me ( I know the reasons why, they are personal and unrelated to medicine). The entire month I am belittled for either unknown or mysterious reasons. Early in the rotation I was allowed some autonomy now I have been relegated to essentially observing and even then I seem to be doing it wrong. I am objectively not making any mistakes however any seemingly wrong look or movement gets me yelled at. In clinic the nurses who are in constant fear of him routinely blame me for issues with patients when I am not even involved! It seems like I am in some form of the upside down (haha). Finally a lot of his patient management and patient dynamics are EXTREMELY outdated and borderline on coercion. It creates a very uncomfortable situation for me at all times.

I come in early with a great attitude every day and have not in any way been negative or combative. 

The situation is however tearing me up - I was previously very confident and this constant stream of negativity and punitive behavior without any instruction or feedback is baffling.

Our PD has told me to essentially deal with it because this person has been a big influence to the program and hospital. He said this surgeon is like that all the time and you can't do anything about it now. There is no value in even discussing some GME or other involvement as I would never do it and because of his status would end with me in trouble. 

My question is how would you guys deal with the huge hit to your confidence and psyche? I was previously running a huge inpatient service and operating alone with no issues and this leader of our field has basically just told me I am worthless. 

Edit: I want to add that my PD is totally supportive of me and a great person. He can not do anything however because this person's status in our field and withing the local hospital system (on the board of directors etc).

pharmacy,Patients like this make leaving so hard,"Feel good story of the day. I’ve been working at my pharmacy for nearly 4 years and quickly developed a close friendship with a sweet elderly couple. The wife was, and still is, going through a very tough time with surgeries (very limited mobility and often resorted to talking to me over the phone as she can barely walk in) and the husband even asked to talk to me in our counselling room at one point, where he proceeded to break down crying about his wife. 

Fast forward to tonight’s shift where they both came in together (she was really struggling to walk but was adamant that she NEEDED to see me before I left) and brought me in a batch of homemade cookies AND a Thank-You Card.

medicine,Coping with a dying patient.,"Without giving too much information away, my patient is a young male, about my age. He came to the US seeking asylum several years ago. He has other family members here, including an uncle, who he has assigned as his health care proxy. He and his family have heard that miracles happen at my inner-city hospital. They say they trust me and any decisions that  I make. The man is dying. He wants to be full code until his father comes in from his home country to say goodbye. I am offering him maximal medical therapy. All other specialties who can actually help him don't want to provide any further interventions. I see him deteriorate in front of my eyes since he was admitted. I feel helpless. I can see him putting on a brave face, but he knows that he is dying.

I've been doing this for 10 years. But this is the first time that a dying patient has affected me so profoundly. I barely have an appetite. I have been waking up in the middle of the night thinking, hoping, praying for him to make it through long enough to see his family. every encounter leaves me feeling more empty. like I'm an imposter-just there to write notes and document a poor prognosis. 

I'm sorry if I sound sappy, but I need to let his out.

Edit: 
thanks for the support. 
To clarify,  he probably is too sick for intervention. At this time everything that was proposed would be palliative in nature and he is at high risk for complications.

pharmacy,"New Pharmacist, Need Verification tips and help","Hi everyone,

I've been working as a retail pharmacist for 3 months now. I have noticed that I am increasingly becoming more OCD about everything and it's really slowing everything down and the techs hate it. 

I work at Rite Aid, and on the data entry screen I have to read the name on the script against the chosen names in parts, same for DoB. For the drug part and strength I break up the drug name into parts and confirm it with the chosen, because I have this terrible idea that if I read the entire ddug name on script against the entire drug name that was done by techs I might somehow read it wrong. I have to read this several times. Same for quantity and refills and finally Sig. Have to be read several times.

I don't have actual OCD. But I picked up these terrible habits over 3 months and now I'm sick of it. I think what might have scarred me was early on I caught another pharmacists mistake which made me overly cautious. But it's too cautious and it makes me very very slow.

I didn't understand how her ECG apparently changed so much in the span of two hours so I consulted with an attending who claimed these ECGs can't belong to the same person. Just to be clear, we've confirmed that there was no mistake and both of these ECGs are hers.

Any ideas how she can shift from left ecg to right ecg in such a short period of time? I've yet to encounter a Bundle Branch Block (among other things) that got reversed or suddenly cured, especially at 89, so naturally I was curious.

I've seen others mention interesting things they do on this subreddit and would love to hear more. What is your title? What is an average day like for you? Do you work a normal 9-5 type schedule?

pharmacy,Getting sick of working conditions - we need to act.,"Pharmacists, if no one wants to unionize for fear of losing your job then fine. But we need to attack other aspects. We need to have sane minded people in ACPE and start shutting down subpar schools to alleviate the oversupply issue. We need activists in the board of pharmacy to address the lacking and abusive labor laws enacted by the retail chains. 

I don't care if we make 120k a year, we are professionals and seriously need to stop this. We need to take action against CVS, WAGS, etc and also the abundance of pharmacy schools giving us no leverage. How can we organize this? Seriously we can't keep being so complacent, I think it's time to fight for better working conditions and staffing. It's legitimately unsafe to the public.

pharmacy,"""You guys are NOT doctors""","First off I want to say this may be a longer than normal post, sorry. Second I must admit and apologize. I lost my temper with a patient over how little respect they have for our profession, but I should not have gotten into a heated argument about it with other patients in the waiting room. I understand it wasn't professional of me to do that and I will definitely work on keep my temper better under control. Now onto the story. 

Last night I was woking my regular shift at my pharmacy, 4pm to midnight, when this patient comes to pick up their medicine. They process to ask me questions like why did it take so long, why did we call their doctor, why are we giving them such a hard time about medicines that he has been taking for ""15 years"". Now I have no clue what this patient was asking or ranting about so I pulled up their profile in order to better understand the the situation.  Immediately I knew why we were being more precaution about their medications. The patient just got new insurance with our company and their plan will only allow them to fill their prescription within our company's pharmacies. The medications in question were OxyContin 80mg 1T BID and Dilaudid 8mg 1T QID PRN pain. Remember, this is a new patient who has never fill at any of our locations before and the dosing for their pain medications are EXTREMELY high. I informed the patient as to why we were doing this, and their respond was ""SO?!, I've been on this medicaiton for 15 years and you guys are NOT doctors"". I was stunned at first, but I calmly said well we are just doing our jobs, and before I could finish my sentence, the patient cuts me off and said ""Your job is to fill whatever my doctors tells you to fill, you guys are NOT doctors and shouldn't be sticking your nose in places where it doesn't belong"". After that last comment, I lost it and we got into an argument for about 15 minutes. I told the patient that they are completely rude and do not respect our profession for just doing our jobs. They responded with well you guys are NOT doctors and as your new patient, whatever I give you you fill.

After the patient left, I was still pissed off, but I had to gather myself quickly because there were a lot of patients out in our waiting room waiting to get their prescription. I got them all out in a reasonable amount of time and apologize to them for getting upset and into an argument with the other patient. All of them told me that I had nothing to be sorry about and that I was just defending our profession from an extremely rude patient. 

I know we deal with rude and ignorant patients and doctors on a daily basis, but that still does not give them the right to completely be disrespectful to us at all. We are NOT overpaid pill counters, we are healthcare providers! 

To the pharmacists out there that would have probably let this go I say to you, DON'T! Defend yourself and your profession. You worked LONG AND HARD to get to where you are and NO ONE should EVER disrespect you like that. You have EARNED your respect and should demand it as well. Just try not lose your temper like I did and get into a heated argument with them in front of other patients.",65,102,2017-12-14,PHARMA,0.11287080496549606,0.8620092868804932,0.02511991746723652

medicine,Thoughts on transgender physicians? (Hope the mods allow this post!),"IM resident here. I've realized I'm at least gender fluid, and it feels like I'm living two separate lives. It's been tough hiding one part or the other, and I feel much more at ease around the people that know both sides of me. I'd really like to open up to more than just my closest friends. I'm ok being ""part time"" in terms of how I present myself, but I imagine things would be easier if I didn't always have to be secretive about my extracurricular activities. 

I'm also wondering if a full transition would ever be feasible in the future. One of the biggest concerns is work of course. It's easier to keep sexuality on the DL, but any big change in appearance could potentially draw negative attention to something that's arguably more stigmatized than being gay. I wonder if even being ""part time"" with only a select number of people in the know could bring big professional consequences.

I know a lot of this depends on local culture. I'm in a coastal region that has a larger number of trans folks, and in a specialty that's perhaps more supportive than surgical specialties for example. The people that do know about me are supportive, but I've only confided in one person at work outside my program. Patients would be a big wild card, and a scary one for sure.

That said, I'd like to get a feel for the sort of reactions you all would have if one of your colleagues revealed this about themself.

medicine,Steerable needle,"Good day I'm a master student at the Technical University of Delft. I'm trying to ascertain how much needs there is for a steerable needle instrument. The needle in question can steer trough viscous mediums by changing the shape of it's head. It uses a unique push and pull system that allows the needle to be very long and slender and not buckle. This is the needle 
https://www.bitegroup.nl/author/martascali/

Our team has to ascertain if there is a need for it and where. Furthermore a rough estimate for how much it may cost. 

The advantage of the needle is the fact you can steer around particular parts, also you could reach multiple parts of an organ with only one main incision. The use we envision right would be in treating prostate cancer by delivering radioactieve particles to different parts using less incisions, or maybe during brain surgery to avoid critical areas. 

Despite this we have never spoken with a surgeon or actually got any feedback about the usefulness of something like this. Hence why I am reaching out to this reddit.

I have been in practice myself for year and have built my patient load to about 1/3 of where I would like to be, but he is going to be handing me over his patients. Many of his patients are very elderly (80s-90s) and reviewing the charts reveals quite a few are on opiates and benzodiazepines. I let him know about three months ago that I would not be prescribing any narcotics long term so he has been notifying his patients that they will need to seek pain management if they want to continue long-term opiates. I am trying to figure out how to best handle the benzodiazepine use. It concerns me in the elderly and especially concerned me when it is being used concomitantly with opiates. As I see these patients come in, I think I’m going to ask each and everyone of them to come in for a separate visit to discuss their benzodiazepine use and it’s associated risks. I would like to get many of them off of the benzodiazepines but I see this as being a very hard task. I have thought about referring some to psychiatry, but psychiatry in our area is very limited.

Have any of you dealt with this and what measures did you take that seemed to help the best for discussion of benzodiazepine use and tapering patients off of them?

medicine,A curious online case of factitious disorder and persistent seeking of validation,"**I'll preface this by saying that I hope this falls within the acceptable boundaries of this subreddit, and that I have made efforts to avoid revealing anyone's ""internet identity."" My only goal is to share this with you all for your personal benefit, and to shed light on a potential issue we face in the anonymous social media era.**

----

Roughly two months ago, a user posted an inquiry about the use of cardiovascular medication in the treatment of their anxiety. They were concerned of its implications beyond reducing anxiety symptoms, and were receptive to answers regarding dosage, withdrawal, and potential alternatives. A positive outcome was found without encroaching on ""internet doctoring"" territory, and everything seemed fine.

Over the subsequent months, posts from various usernames appeared at random with similar inquiries, but with slight variations in medical history, personal details (height, weight), and primary concern. Questions began to include broader ideas, though mostly limited to cardiovascular health and anxiety. During this time, most of those individuals responding to these concerns were unaware of the pattern, or rather thought little of it. As a student reading for my own benefit, I formed the idea that these concerns will far more prevalent than I had thought.

However, the frequency of new posts began to increase at an alarming rate, and it became very apparent. At times, multiple posts per hour from different accounts with varying issues. The similarities and overlap stuck out like a sore thumb. Analysis of usernames revealed brand new accounts, and archives of old posts showed that previous accounts had been wiped or deleted shortly after posting. More alarmingly, the responses offered by the original poster became combative, argumentative, and seeking of validation that a health emergency was occurring.

**In other words, the user was slowly modifying their HPI and PMH based on previous responses such that those providing feedback would become alarmed and suggest drastic action (e.g. ""You need to go to the ER.""). They were using past information to construct medical emergencies.**

Eventually others began to call them out, and so they expanded to using older accounts (though clearly wiped, with no prior history -- possibly purchased), and offering stories of not only themselves, but now friends and loved ones. Each time searching for someone to tell them there was a medical emergency, or that their doctor had been blatantly incorrect or risking malpractice.

As a result, this online space is forced to view every inquiry with extreme skepticism, at risk of feeding the perceived needs of one individual.

medicine,Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents(GBCAs) PSA,"Hello everyone! So I am not sure if I am out of place posting this(I suppose the mods will decide), nonetheless.....

As of late, I've seen many posts on meddit about the usage of contrast agents and how radiologists worry is overstated, and that may or may not be true. That said, GBCAs, especially with the most recent FDA warning 4 days ago, are more apparently becoming an increasingly contentious topic in radiology, and that will soon spread to other medical fields. I've recently gotten several private messages asking for my opinion on the matter, so I figured I would cover some of the disinformation I see on the sub + those private question in one go :)

GBCAs are still being recommended according to the FDA. However, there have been several concerning studies relating to resulting heavy-metal deposits in brain and bone. 

When recommending a GBCA, the retention characteristics are of the utmost importance. The first generation GBCAs which have linear properties are the most dangerous. These are currently being barred in Europe and the FDA is increasingly considering barring them as well. To such an extent that black box warning is required to be read out to patients in full for linear agents. If you can avoid it, never order linear agents. Always order macrocyclic agents which is the most recent generation and have been shown to have a far lesser deposit of heavy metal. The reason is macrocyclic agent disassociate from the ligand at a much slower rate due to a more tightly bound chelated-Gd3+ complex. Most recently ""high relaxivity"" agents which are good for either increasing the contrast effect or being able to have a lower dosage for a similar contrast level. 

We do not yet understand the relation of delayed or chronic toxicity and Gd3+, we are still researching it. We only know that there is a correlation between Gd3+ and free gadolinium deposits in areas of the body. Due to the unpredictability of anion-cation capture mechanisms in the blood, there is no known way to quantify the risk of free gadolinium. 

Point being, if you order MR, make sure the use of contrast is warranted in accordance with ACR criteria which have been adjusted for recent research into GBCAs. Do not just order contrast because ""you feel like it"", I see that far too often given the potential risks involved. Gadolinium is still a heavy metal, it has risks that we do not fully understand. 

I'm sure many of you know some of this already, but I just wanted to do a quick review because of things I heart not only in meddit, but on the wards too! And as many of you know, it is very dependent on the hospital. In some hospitals providers request certain agents and radiologists override if need be, a lot of the time it is an internal process and providers just way with contrast and the radiologist chooses the agent. Point being, if you have the choice to recommend, recommend macrocyclic agents. If you see in the report a radiologist used a linear agent. Obviously we are very busy and it is not on you to do it for every time it happens. But if you have some free time, it doesn't hurt to call and ask why they used a linear agent. Or if that radiologist even knows macrocyclic agents exist. While in most tertiary centers macrocyclic agents are common, in some smaller centers some radiologists and general doctors may not know about them if they are not up to date on the latest literature which we know is a possibility.

medicine,what are your thoughts on strict corporate practice of medicine laws in California?,"I've only recently learned about these laws after doing the paperwork for starting my own medical practice in California. In California medicine you can practice medicine under your self (solo proprietor) or under a ""professional medical corporation"". A ""professional medical corporation"" is different than a regular corporation in that all equity owners of the corporation must be ""licensed"", ie they must have be an MD, DO, RN, DPM etc. At least 51% of the shares must be held by an MD/DO, the remaining 49% of shares can be held by non-doctors with a license. No regular ""layperson"", corporation, or even hospitals can be owners of a medical corporation.

IMO, the benefit of this outweighs the restrictions.

The benefit: Physicians maintain autonomy and control their business/medical practice and cannot be bought out or controlled by non-medical entities/corporations or hospitals. In theory it allows physicians make clinical decisions based on their clinical judgement and not influenced by a non-medical person or entity.

The restriction: It limits investment from private equity firms or venture capital firms if you want to rapidly expand your practice.

I have many friends who went to pharmacy school. Unfortunately pharmacists are not consider ""medical professionals"" in the eyes of the law. One consequence of this is CVS have came into California and have an almost monopoly in the market. Many pharmacists are forced to work for CVS (out in the middle of nowhere bc all the jobs in the city are saturated or not have a job at all). Many independent pharmacy cannot directly compete with CVS. I'm kind of glad the laws in California have prevented this from happening to doctors.

medicine,This great patient I had,"Jim and I met a few years ago, when he was transferred to our hospital in the middle of the night for no acute reason whatsoever. It was the third week of my PGY2 year, so the term ""neurologist"" applied to me only loosely at best. So I barely knew what to do when I got the call that this gentleman and his wife had shown up on our floor, at 3am, with ""like 5 lbs of documentation (1).""

This is known to happen at this particular hospital from time to time. We're a tertiary referral facility, and there's often a backlog of weird cases awaiting transport once some logistical issues or other gets ironed out. I only learned this later, though; when I asked him what had changed or compelled the transfer, he just shrugged and said ""Nothing. Nothing's changed. That's the problem, man."" 

Fair enough.

Between what he and his wife told me, and also the forest-killing amount of paperwork he'd arrived with, I gathered that Jim had been having an increasingly rough time for the last 2 years. He showed me pictures of himself on his phone: he'd been tall, with close cropped, grey hair and softail Harley. His first symptom had been a bit of foot weakness, which he'd happily ignored until he wasn't able to upshift anymore. His last ride had been a puzzled, pissed off, 50 yard idle. His wife hadn't minded much, as she'd been a lukewarm fan of the bike at best, even before they got married. But his problems progressed, and since then, he'd been sliding slowly downhill despite regular IVIG infusions for his ""refractory CIDP.""

You know where this is going: when I met him, he was a flaccid mess of mixed reflexes and twitches you could spot from the doorway. His voice was only a little slurred and he wasn't having too much trouble with chewing or swallowing. Limb-onset ALS is like that. Luckily, his left arm was still working fairly well at the time, and so he used it to put on a pair of sunglasses at the end of the exam.

""Is it, um, too bright in here?"" I asked. 

""Yeah."" So I flicked off the lights for him. When I turned around, though, he was still wearing them. 

""Is it *still* too bright?"" I asked. It was the wee hours of the am, and his blinds were shut to boot.


After a long beat, he replied, ""Nah, man. I just like to look cool."" He was grinning his ass off. 

Maybe he caught me by surprise, or it was his delivery, or it was just the 4 am giggles, but I laughed long and hard. I couldn't help it, I liked him - which clinched the diagnosis, of course. I'd learned early in my intern year that niceness is something of a risk factor. In fact, I was reasonably sure that it was ALS at the end of our first encounter, but I didn't say anything. I was just starting my training, after all, and barely knew what the hell I was talking about half the time (2). It didn't seem appropriate to give him a diagnosis like that, on my own, in the middle of the night. There were lots of good reasons not to say anything right then. But if I'm being honest now, part of my hesitation also stemmed just a bit from fear of telling *that* on my own - which is understandable, but it's not something I'm especially proud of. 

We told him the next morning, my attending and I. Or, rather, my attending did an excellent job of laying everything out, while I stood behind and slightly to the right, still floating in that peculiar, nigh-hungover, post-call limbo that all younger residents live in for a little while before they get the hang of things. Towards the end of the conversation, Jim asked me directly, ""Is that what you think, too? ALS?""

""That's what I think,"" I told him, which just made him sigh heavily. 

Out of all the ways he could have handled the news - screaming, wailing, a stoic ""I see,"" - his response was to look at his wife, and to tell her that he loved her. I still remember it. I'd find out later that they'd been married for 18 years at the time of his diagnosis. We did the only useful thing you can do at a time like that, and quietly stepped out.

****

He wasn't a patient that I followed regularly. He wasn't in my clinic or anything, and so it was a little surprising how often we ran into one another. I caught up with him perhaps half a year later, while doing a neuromuscular clinic rotation. Right off the bat, he asked me how I was doing and whether I'd cried after diagnosing him. He had his son with him that time, and they had a good laugh about it/me.

""He looked like a girl after watching one of that guy's movies. You know, that guy?"" he asked.

""Nick Sparks,"" his son said, a little too quickly.

""Yeah, like a Nick Sparks movie!""

I tried to interject here, but nobody wanted to hear that I hadn't cried. He did, however, want me to help him appeal to insurance to cover a hand-controlled, electric shifter so that he could ride again. Which I couldn't, of course. Shifter or not, he wouldn't have been able to balance to save his life, and he only had one working arm. 

After hearing me out, he gave me that same, heavy sigh.""All right then, Nick. What else you got for me?"" 

Obviously, I didn't have much. With a diagnosis like ALS, nobody does. And I can tell you, going from handicapped motorcycle aids to talking about advanced directives is.... not the easiest transition. But he was very reasonable, and answered all my questions. He let my medical students examine him, to see what relatively advanced ALS looked like.

But he very gleefully called me Nick the whole time. Which isn't my name, as it turns out. It doesn't even share any of the same letters. So as you can imagine, he kept it up for the next few years, and it never failed to confuse the hell out of any students or attendings I happened to be with.

****

It carried on like that: random, unscheduled encounters as his symptoms slowly progressed. 

I'd see him again in our multidisciplinary ALS clinic from time to time. I saw him once in the hospital, when he came in for a wound on his leg that had become infected; his primary team consulted us and we didn't have much to offer. 

Towards the beginning of my PGY4 year, I actually ran into him and his wife in our hospital's cafeteria. His voice was much more slurred by that point. He had a PEG in place, and he was reclining in a powerchair. His wife and I split a turkey burger while he slowly worked on a massive milkshake ""with a doubleshot of Boost."" At one point, I stole his sunglasses out of his shirt pocket, which left him mildly outraged.

Putting them on, I asked him ""Who's cool now, Jim? *I'm* cool. I'm David Bowie. I'm Freddie Mercury when he had a mustache (3).""

He laughed. He told me they looked terrible, and that I deserved to get run over by his wheelchair. He asked me when I - Nick Sparks, mind you - was going to produce my next chick flick. But I didn't take them off until I had to, when my pager sounded a stroke alert, and I had to leave in a rush.

****

That's the last time I saw Jim, but it wasn't the last time we were in touch. The front desk at our clinic got in touch with me a little while ago, and told me that I had a package. In my fellowship, I float between a few different sites. I don't have a dedicated clinic of my own, so there's no single place to keep things addressed to me. Unfortunately, in this case, it meant that my package had floated around for a few weeks, until a) somebody remembered/rediscovered it and b) I was back on service.

The note, which he'd dictated, read:

*Dear Nick,*

*I hope you're doing well. I heard you had a little girl, which is great news! This is for her. If you don't have a name yet, name her Jim. Not James, that's too formal.*

*I'm off to hospice like we talked about. I think it's time. It's going to be ok so don't worry about me. Thanks for everything!*

*Best of luck,*

*Jim*

Included was a small bear, with a pink ribbon around it's neck and a paisely pattern on all four paws. My daughter hadn't even been born the last time I'd seen him. I think he knew my wife was pregnant, but that was about it. He must have asked around about me.

Maybe this time I *did* cry, though I really tried not to. I found a quiet corner, and I probably looked very ugly, which I think Jim would have liked (4). 

****

I called his wife a few days ago, who's doing well enough, and who I think was happy to hear from me. He hadn't lasted very long after going to hospice. I guess he knew. I gave the bear to my daughter, and it's just another one of her stuffed animals now. She's 19 months, after all. 

I know patients die, but this one's different. This wasn't a medical mystery, or a cautionary tale. I didn't lose him. And it's not neccessarily tragic - it's just the story of this funny, great guy who managed to stay funny and stay great, even after he was handed a death sentence. He loved his wife and he missed the road. From the beginning of my PGY2 year, he saw me grow up, in a way. He became part of my personal history and we shared some laughs.

He was the patient that did at least as much for me as I did for him. Sometimes, people are amazing.

medicine,Thanks from a nurse,"Had a patient last night with facial swelling. Started a few days prior, doc figured it was an infected salivary gland, plan was to d/c him the following morning on P.O. abx. Around 2am he spiked a high fever and the swelling was worsening. He said he could breathe ok but I didn’t believe him, he was a stoic kind of guy who didn’t want to cause trouble. I text paged the night hospitalist and she threw in orders for Tylenol and pain. I rarely talk to night shift docs since my text page game is tight, but I paged her again and asked her to call me. Once she did I told her I know she’s busy but I need her to come see this guy right now even though his sats were fine. She came up right away, didn’t question me, didn’t give me a hard time, and really listened to what I was saying when she got up there.  Then she went into beast mode ordering all kinds of tests and monitoring for results all while managing the rest of the hospital.  The second I thought I’d have a chance to take a breath she’d Be calling me to make sure I was in the next step and his responses to what I’d just completed. She took it on herself to call ENT, call anesthesia, call the intensivist, and keep me In the loop so I could facilitate and have all of the supplies at bedside and be working on getting an ICU bed ready. Within 90 minutes they were wheeling him to surgery. 

If the hospitalist hadn’t listened to me, taken me seriously, and fought so hard i really don’t think the pt would have made it to morning.

medicine,What do you keep in your emergency first aid kit?,"So over the Christmas break, one of my family members got a pretty nasty lac on her fingertip that was bleeding pretty badly. Ended up getting it under control after 30 minutes of applying pressure with tissue paper. Realized that would have been a good time to have a first aid kit.

Just wondering what you guys keep in your first aid kits. Seems like gauze, tape, silver nitrate, suture kit, lidocaine, would be a good start. Wondering if any of the emergency guys keep anything that would be useful that isn't commonly thought about.

I also do a fair amount of wilderness activities so a good wilderness kit would be helpful too.",80,41,2017-12-29,PHARMA,0.022629044950008392,0.8952714204788208,0.08209957927465439

medicine,How comfortable are you prescribing for family or friends?,"Recently had a friend who lost his albuterol inhaler right before he boarded a plane to fly out for vacation and it raised an interesting thought that I'm sure lots of docs prescribe in these situations for family/friends. (I'd never touch any controlled substances of course in these settings). He is a very by-the-rules kind of guy and he was able to find an urgent care clinic at his destination. He insisted that he did not want to put my license in any jeopardy.

Googling this shows it seems fairly widespread and most commonly prescribed meds include antibiotics, antihistamine, and birth control. And it seems like it can be done on limited/special circumstances but is generally not recommended and the wording for this from different state boards. 

Talking to a colleague in my clinic he says this is super common and as long as the med is not a controlled substance and its not a serious/chronic condition...it's not a big deal.  

Being recently out of residency, I'm still wary of this kind of prescribing practice and was just surprised at how common it seems to be.

medicine,Seriously burnt out,"Not sure if this is allowed. Also on a throwaway account for reasons.

Right now I'm in a pretty small town where the majority of people in my program are married and I consider quitting on a daily basis. Intern year was awful, but we had prelims who I got to hang out with all the time. Now they're gone and I'm left with just myself in this place where I'm miserable. Last year I could at least talk to them outside of work about my problems.

The fact that I'm an introverted asian guy in the rural south doesn't help either. I keep telling myself that once I'm through I can move to a bigger city and maybe start dating more, but there's always this part of me that thinks by that time it'll be too late. Being at the hospital all the time and not having any friends outside of work is really grinding on me and I'm seriously considering quitting, although I'm not confident what I would do afterwards. There have seriously been multiple times that I thought of just ending it since all I do now is go to work and then go home by myself.

Of course this could be problematic if she wants to say in the city.

Just curious how common these are in medicine, and whether hospitals actually bother to enforce these or it's some sort of formality?

medicine,Physicians -- your experience with prestige vs location in choosing a residency?,"M4 here applying to residency. I'm facing a dilemma: 

* great program (but NOT top tier/nationally-known) in a not so desirable area (&lt;100,000 pop city with no connections across the country) versus
* mediocre program in the city I'd love to practice in the future (hometown, large desirable coastal city).

My considerations:

* It'd be a long residency (Radiology, 4-5 years).
* Fellowship in my specialty of choice is essentially required afterward and not as competitive, and either program can reasonably allow me to return to my city/state of choice for fellowship.
* I am open to academia, but not as a top-notch researcher, but as a clinical academic who focuses on teaching and advocacy.
* This is probably the biggest thing I'd have to consider: SO who will be coming with me. She is career driven and her career is limited to large cities. 
* SO and I are minorities, and we'd prefer larger cities that have diversity.

Hopefully people who are more experienced can chime in. Did you sacrifice prestige for the sake of location in choosing a residency program? Or did you value residency program prestige?
