You never hear any sort of discussion on the topic and I find that strange, considering that working in certain parts of the health industry is likely the most emotionally and mentally gruelling work in modern countries, yet many young people want to be doctors without contemplating the awful things they are likely to witness, often encouraged by their parents. 

I knew a girl who was desperate to be a doctor yet was terrified of the sight of blood, yet all of you have probably seen stuff people could only imagine on a battlefield. Anyway, is this topic discussed anymore within the medical industry? Do people keep quiet in case they face certain repercussions? Or is everyone just able to handle it?

medicine,Should we strive to make journal access free to all,"Most physicians (myself included up until recently) do not have access to university library journal subscriptions. Our hospital/practice may give us access to a few journals, or we may pay membership fees to have access to a few of them, but for financial reasons (it costs a few hundred dollars apiece) most people will only have access to a few. This causes a few issues for me:  
1) It is harder to keep current when some articles are published in journals you don't have access to, and may be forced to get your information from elsewhere (i.e. pharmaceutical reps).  
2) There are obscure journals that publish low impact articles that may apply to a single patient, but you can't access it (i.e. the japanese journal of whatever), and thus it is harming that patient that may have benefited from that obscure piece of data.  
3) Physicians from less affluent countries or with limited technology access have no choice but to give suboptimal care if they can't get access to the newest data.  
  
My question is this: should journals, their contributors and publishers, be aiming to provide free access to all in the goal of helping patients to have the best and most evidenced based care available?",56,169,2015-08-03,PHARMA,0.018344007432460785,0.9347471594810486,0.04690884053707123

pharmacy,Food for thought: At the BARE minimum it costs a pharmacy student &gt;600$ to attend mid year,"Notwithstanding you live in the city it occurs, meaning free lodging. But think about it:

~ASHP Mid year ticket: 300$

~Housing: 200$ (if you're way cheap like me) - 400$


This calculation LEAVES OUT airfare, transportation costs when in city, food/recreation costs (come on its norlans), and the PPS nonsense. 

This is borderline predatorial, and IMO, clearly exemplifies a system that places great value in taking advantage of the umpteen, poor, desperate souls ready and willing to literally kill if it means an advantage over another in terms of securing a residency or job. Why do we continue to support this organization?

medicine,Any doctors here who really 'started from the bottom'?,"I thought it would be nice to hear about doctors who truly started with little support (or relatively less support), at the beginning, and got through the gruelling ordeal of medical school.

A lot of the doctors I've known had considerable support from parents, friends and their schools (private etc.). 
I haven't heard much about doctors in less-privileged positions so it seems to me that medicine is, to an extent, an exclusive club for those who have the money and support...

EDIT: I'm honestly inspired by so many of these stories. I can relate to many of them and have a lot of respect for all of you. Here's mine:

I'm the only child of immigrant parents in the UK; both parents only have the high school equivalent in terms of education (relative to the American system - I'm British) and no one in my family went to university, let alone studied medicine. 
When I began high school, my parents split up and my mother lost her job as a teaching assistant at a primary school. This is when I went through a period of depression and lost a sense of who I was etc. but still tried my best to do better than my parents, and the situation I found myself in. My school was one of the worst in the area and, at the time I joined, the headteacher ran away leaving it with a debt of a million pounds (yeah...)

The household income throughout high school was solely state benefits but eventually she found two temp. jobs as a school kitchen assistant and supermarket cashier; household income went to around £9K (the same amount for a year at uni...). Fast forward to the past year and I manage to pick myself up during A-levels and do well enough to get an offer at 2 good UK medical schools. I got myself a job throughout A-levels and, quite depressingly, was getting paid more than my mother but I had a financial pillow (if you will) and disposable income.

medicine,"Non-U.S. physicians currently using EMR, do you find yourself feeling hopeless and, often times, in a fetal position weeping uncontrollably because writing notes has become so nightmarish?","With EMR systems percolating hospitals and physician groups throughout the U.S., EMR overall unfortunately hasn't yet fulfilled its lofty and sanguine promises of improving patient care quality and boosting provider productivity and efficiency. In fact, it's done the opposite, at least at my hospital. There's a ruck of physicians vociferously crying out and railing against the burden of documenting visits and services within our newly implemented system (Epic) and its user-unfriendly interface designs and clunky, out-dated looking templates. Of course, regulations, compliance, and billing mandates such as ACO and P4P metrics, Meaningful Use, and PQRS pose a large chunk of the difficulties for physicians using any EMR, but our system has made it especially difficult.

Our physicians are finding themselves spending hours after work in their home office, slumped in their chair like some dejected fellow whose life and soul have been ripped out and stomped on repeatedly, with a bottle of red wine and a loaded handgun on their desk, catching up on their notes and charting because they couldn't waste time with patients frenetically pointing and clicking through mind-numbingly detailed and overly complex templates and checking off a multitude of pull-down boxes, with intermittent suspirations followed by swills of the bottle and solemn considerations to press the barrel of the gun against the forehead and pull the trigger. Physicians are telling me for the first time in their careers they dread coming into work because of Epic. It's crushed provider satisfaction and crimped patient care.

medicine,Google Docs spell checker means no more red lines under all my medical words,"For my medical studies, I'm currently writing up some study notes, and I'm using Google Docs for the first time for increased portability between home and uni. About 50 pages into it I realized something: there are no red lines under every medical word! For the last few years of medical school, those red lines under correctly spelled medical terminology have driven me crazy, so I am ecstatic about this. 

Unlike Microsoft Word, or any other word processor, Google Docs actually seems to understand medical terminology. For example, ""tympanostomy"", ""debulking"", ""organomegaly"" and ""osteosclerotic"" were all flagged by MS word, but not Google Docs. 

Not only that, but it actually makes good suggestions when medical terminology is spelled wrong, for example it corrected ""methamine"" staining to ""methenamine"". MS word suggests ""Meth amine"", ""methane"" and ""met amine"". 

Sorry if this is a completely ridiculous thing to get excited about, but I figured there'd be other slightly obsessive redditors out there who want to use a spell checker but don't want to have practically every word identified as a mistake.

Sure. When I have six pages of prescriptions (down from nine, but we had just managed to get it to five) and a line forming at drop off, I really want to ring up all the crap you should be taking to the front of the store or buying at Wal Mart.

Things you wish you had done differently, or wish you had known starting residency.","After commenting on /u/ShamelesslyPlugged 's post about their NPI, it made me realize there is a lot of stuff I wish I had known before starting residency, so heres some stuff that I think applies to most regardless of their specialty  

**Money**

* Set up [IBR repayments](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven) right away for student debt.  
*  Spend your money within reason.  Not a god damn thing will change with your debt by penny pinching.  Just don't go into further debt.  
*  Know that it will take money to move you to your new job once residency is over.  Be prepared to get a small loan or save for this.  And don't be afraid to ask for a moving bonus from a new employer.  
*  I'd advise you not to buy a house that may lock you down to a location, what if your job requires you to move?        

**Clerical**

* Scan all of your diplomas, SSN, Birth certificate, drivers license, etc. as PDFs and save them somewhere safe.  Scan your medical school diploma and eventually residency diploma because youll need those for fellowship and job.
* Set up a personal medical-use email address like on gmail.  Use this for all societies, letters, applications, abstracts, etc.  Forward all email from my coordinator to goto this email address as well (ms exchange allows you to create rules to autoforward).  Once you graduate from residency, you'll lose your email login, and screw yourself over with forgotten logins, forgotten email attachments, etc.  
*   Never use personal phone or addresses on practically anything.  Use the departments phone and address.  Unless they want my emergency contact info, I stuck with the dept after my pgy2.  
*  If you're going to use the cloud for storing non HIPAA stuff, only use one. I made the mistake of spreading stuff out through google attachments, work email attachments, google drive, and dropbox...  Now when I want to find it I can't.  
*  Catalog important documents.  Make duplicates of important documents.  If you're mailing something, make a duplicate before you do.  If you fax something, most new fax machines have an email feature where it emails you a pdf.  Do this for important forms.
*  All smart phones have free photo to pdf features.  Take photos of CME reciepts.   

**Personal**  

*  Don't burn bridges. Try not to burn any, but its bound to happen you don't get along with at least one person.  
*  To a degree, do not try to be best friends with your coordinator.  Be nice and friendly, but that is a professional relationship, and too many times there was a conflict of interest (we had a hands on coordinator, so this may not be universally true).  
*  Tell people your intentions upfront.  I never grasped the concept of lying for gain.  In med school some people said lie and say you want to do surgery, or they'll give you bad evals.  Maybe that's true for a one-two month rotation, but not for residency.  Be upfront with goals.  Be polite with dislikes.  
*  Never get drunk in front of bosses.  

**Professional**  
  
*  People will notice and remember people who are habitually late.  
*  It pays to know and be on a friendly basis with people in other departments.  From my experience --Oh you want a histologic picture and description of an osteosarcoma by today at 4pm for your abstract submission and you didn't plan on putting my name in a caption? go F* yourself.  
*  If you plan to do an abstract [edit -for a poster or platform], you better make sure to try to get a manuscript published.",28,130,2015-08-10,PHARMA,0.0689380019903183,0.9047136306762695,0.02634834125638008

I would obviously make sure I am adequately protected first, as I cannot help anyone if I myself become afflicted by the same toxins and chemicals. Follow the ABCDEs, including removing any clothing that may still be contaminated. Yet I quickly hit a point where my gut is telling me to irrigate any wounds and shower them and get them as clean as I can, but in Tianjin the use of water set off a chemical reaction of some kind that caused the explosions. They don't know all the chemicals involved, but they specifically mention calcium carbide and sodium cyanide in some reports. We can dismiss this all day saying nothing like this would happen here but that doesn't really help me learn now does it?

medicine,Need some advice - military independent medical practitioner transitioning to civilian world.,"Hey meddit. This doesn't apply directly to medschool (which I see is not allowed in the sidebar) so I am hoping this post is OK. If not, please let me know!

I'm an independent duty corpsman in the US Navy. If you dont know what that is, we go through an intensive 13-18 month (depending on the specific program) school which teaches us graduate level A&amp;P and pharm, etc. Once we graduate, we are sent out to places where there are no doctors or PA's and we act as the sole medical personnel for many people. I have been doing this for around 4 years with 6 years of medic experience prior. I currently work in a clinic alongside doctors and PA's. I do everything that the other clinicians do in my clinic except write for scheduled drugs. 

I will be getting out in around 6 months due to some medical complications and I need to know what I should do next. There is a fire inside me that is burning for me to go to med school and be a doctor, but that's a long road and I am turning 30 this year. The other part of me just says go to PA school and get out there in the market. But I have heard that PA's dont get any respect in the civilian world. 

I have no children, I am not married. My school will be paid for, so money isn't much of a factor. I will also be getting a monthly payment for housing as well as my disability.

I hope you'll excuse my using an alt to ask; since we're all sensitive to our insecurities.

Anyways I've been voluntold to join my hospital ethics committee. The thing is that I'm awkward and have trouble expressing my own views when put on the spot. I've generally kept to myself during med school and residency and am probably identified as  the ""nice guy who pulls his weight but is a bit boring.""

My ethics training is really just the several lectures from med school; and I find my personal tendencies toward nihilism a bit of a barrier as well. I didn't find the case discussions helpful in finding the ""correct"" action, rather my impression is that the purpose of the exercise was to make sure every base was covered but the final action would be the same if governed by the case attending's ""gut-impulse"".

medicine,A basic search pattern for that 3AM head CT you can't get radiology to finalize. Including bonus color commentary!,"### **Basic approach to the 3AM head CT when radiology is ~~too busy~~ being a bunch of jerks.**



Let's come up with a scenario that almost never happens in a hospital  - Let's say [it's 3AM and you must be lonely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uD8DlxwHsE). Err, I mean, let's say you get paged and someone on the floor is acting all loopy or can't move half their body or whatever. The bottom line is that you need a head CT and radiology is currently swamped with the delightful opportunity they have been given by the ED to generate **a lot** of RVUs. 

Time to take a look at the pictures yourself, and... fuck this is complicated. Well dear reader, I'm here to give you some (hopefully) useful advice and a general approach to looking at a head CT so that you can casually tell the radiology resident who calls you 3 hours later that, ""we already know about the bleed, thanks.""


### **General head CT info &amp; background:**


* Indications for a CT head with and without are pretty weak – mostly if people can't get an MRI. In general, start with a C- head then discuss with the radiologist if you think you need contrast.
* By contrast (heh), I can hardly think of a time that I *wouldn't* be okay with a non-contrast head CT. The brain (in adults) is a very radiation resistant structure and we change the dose based on the amount of bone the beam has to penetrate (based on the scout image) dynamically during the scan too, to decrease exposure. Plus if someone's sick enough that you think they need a head CT to rule out badness, just do it.


**Head CTs nowadays come with at least 2 and usually 4 reconstructions:**

* Axial images with a soft-tissue reconstruction algorithm 
* Axial images with a bone reconstruction algorithm
* Coronal and sagittal plan soft-tissue reconstructions
* Sometimes you'll get a true-axial reconstruction if the patient is in the scanner all wonky. If you have this, use this instead of the ""regular"" axial for everything listed below.



##### Stuff in between the lines is level 2 info. If you don't particularly care *why* we harp about window settings so much, you can probably skip this. You still need to window your studies appropriately.


----------------

&gt; You'll hear radiologists talk about ""windowing"" a study. It's important that you learn how to do this too. I'll get more into specifics below in the guide, but let me give you some background. As you know, we generally look at things in black, white, and maybe 16 shades of grey. Well, the data we get on a CT scan is FAR more than our eyes can see. So when we want to tease out subtle differences in density that could indicate a lesion, we really need to be able to assign different colors to those densities on a dynamic basis – hence the term ""windowing."" It's like when you take a picture with a DSLR camera and shoot in RAW. The camera sees more than your eye does, and you have to use software to be able to get that information back out. It's very important for ALL radiology studies nowadays to window around so you can see what you want to see. If you don't do this, you'll miss things. 

&gt;If you want some more info, [check out this website](http://regionstraumapro.com/post/16349545265) for a fairly decent ELI10 discussion of windowing and leveling and why it's important.

---------------

&gt;This is the last background thing to discuss, but I think it's one of the most important points, especially for radiology residents so I want to emphasize this:

* All the window/level settings suggested below are just that  - SUGGESTIONS
* You need to look at the pictures as you're doing this to make sure that you can really see the grey-white differentiation well. Sometimes it's right on the money, but most of the time I use these pre-sets to [get me in the ballpark](https://i.imgur.com/a2V11Hy.png) and then manually adjust the window and level [until I'm happy with it](https://i.imgur.com/YpjlFBj.png). 
* You should also practice adjusting on the fly if you don't like the look of a particular slice.

#### **1.) [Axial Bone Reconstructions](https://i.imgur.com/aZ4ompY.png)**
I start with the stuff I'm least interested in so I don't forget to look at it. You'll never forget to look for a stroke or bleed on a head CT, but you might walk right by some mass in the paranasal sinuses if you don't look.


1. Put them on **[soft tissue windows](https://i.imgur.com/lsaX5Fa.png)** first (W/L is about 350/50)
    * Scroll up one side and down the other
    * Look for *subcutaneous edema*, *masses*, or *hematomas*
    * In the setting of trauma, the soft tissue lacs will show you where the fractures are (usually)
2. Put it on **[bone windows](https://i.imgur.com/aZ4ompY.png)** (W/L about 3000/250)
     * Look at the **[mastoids](http://download.e-bookshelf.de/download/0003/7888/30/L-X-0003788830-0002226410.XHTML/images/img_004_001.jpg)**
         * Are they pneumatized and clear?
     *  Does the **[middle ear cavity](https://journals.lww.com/thehearingjournal/PublishingImages/Clinical%20Consultation-Figure%202.bmp)** look grossly intact?
         * Can you see the inner ear bones?
         * Is there fluid in the middle ear?
     *  Go up one side of the **[calvaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvaria_\(skull\))** and down the other
         * Are there fractures?
         * You need to at least be vaguely familiar with where the sutures are so you don't mistake them for fractures
     * Look at the **[paranasal sinuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses) &amp; [orbits](http://humangrossanatomy.com/radiology/headneck/hartman2005/slideshow/img34.jpg)**
         * There's probably mucosal thickening, especially if it's during cold/flu season.
         * There may even be nasal polyps or mucous retention cysts
         * look carefully at the bone and make sure they're not eroded.
     * Look briefly at the **[orbits](http://humangrossanatomy.com/radiology/headneck/hartman2005/slideshow/img34.jpg)**
         * This is just a once-over, but it also makes it very easy to see if they've had cataract surgery or not.
     * Look at the **[skull base](http://headneckbrainspine.com/Skull-Base-CT.php)**
         * At the very least, check the craniocervical junction and the carotid and jugular foramen
         * The anatomy here is very complicated and I still depend on anatomic references when trying to describe skull base fractures and pathology. Don't feel bad if this is a black box for you.


#### **2.) [Sagittal Soft-Tissue Reconstructions](https://i.imgur.com/FRlzgas.png)**  (set these on generic brain windows, W/L about 80/40)

1. Give the **whole brain** a once-over
     * Are the *[sulci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulcus_\(neuroanatomy\))* and *[gyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrus)* well formed? 
     * What does the *[cerebellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum)* look like? 
         * Any chiari malformations or obvious posterior fossa masses?
         * Any blood along the *[tentorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentorium_cerebelli)*? 
2. Get your ass to ~~Mars~~ **[midline](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/normalmribrain-150112010842-conversion-gate02/95/normal-mri-brain-41-638.jpg?cb=1421025848)**
     * This is one of the most ""money"" shots of everything you get
         * Check out the *corpus callosum*, *mammillary bodies*, and *tectum*
         * Check out the *hypothalamus*, *pituitary*, and *hypothalamic stalk*
         * Check out the *cerebellar vermis*
         * Check out the *thalami* and *optic nerves* if you can see them
         * Check out the *midbrain*, *pons*, and *medulla*
3. Look at the craniocervical junction, atlantoaxial articulation, and the C-spine. 
     * Make sure there are no fractures or obvious spinal stenosis 
     * (quickly go back to bone windows for this)



#### **3.) [Coronal Soft-Tissue Reconstructions](https://i.imgur.com/BnaE4Zt.png)** (I look at these on my high contrast (""stroke"") and blood sensitive window settings, about 40/40 and 125/75, respectively)
1. Look over the cerebral convexities for **extra-axial fluid collections**
1. Look along the falx and tentorium for evidence of **subarachnoid or subdural blood**
1. Look for **venous sinus thrombosis**
1. Check out the **ventricles** as you're going back and forth
1. Make sure there's no **herniation**
1. Spend an extra 10 seconds convincing yourself that the **temporal lobes** are well-formed and symmetric
1. Check out the **[orbits](https://i.imgur.com/GYn7JdL.png)** once again, make sure the EOMs and the globes and optic nerves look well-formed and symmetric. 


#### **4.) [Axial Soft-Tissue Reconstructions](https://i.imgur.com/YpjlFBj.png)** (This is where you'll spend the most time. You need to look at this on both high-contrast and blood sensitive window settings – whether you change them multiple times or go through everything with one then the other is up to you)
1. Evaluate the brain parenchyma for **stroke** (this is where you want high contrast windows (about 40/40) so you can see the grey-white junction well)
     * Scroll through and make sure the grey-white differentiation is good. You should be able to draw a line around it. If it's blurry and in a vascular distribution, that's concerning.
     * Familiarize yourself with the general territories of the ACA, MCA, and PCA
2. Evaluate the brain parenchyma for **bleeds** (""blood windows,"" 125/75)
     * **[Epidural](http://images.radiopaedia.org/images/7330/22801a555da18b0db90674093dcf3a.jpg)**
         * Should be obvious, convex appearance, doesn't cross sutures, expands the potential space between the inner table and the dura
     * **[Subdural](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijvm/2012/753596.fig.002c.jpg)**
         * Usually obvious, can be hard to see on axials if not large – correlate with coronal imaging
         * Can cross sutures but shouldn't cross the midline
     * **[Subarachnoid](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Qj18AayNgtg/UZUT_oGaYsI/AAAAAAAAJ1I/ZBXwP9dVt14/s1600/SUBARACHNOID+HEMORRHAGE+CT+scan+.png)**
         * Often subtle, you're looking for hyperattenuation in a sulcus or ventricle
         * Collect in DEPENDENT areas – check out the sylvian fissure, basal cisterns, and posterior horns of the lateral ventricles


3. Evaluate for **[masses](http://www.medandlife.ro/images/Images/arhiva/Vol1no2/reviews/ciurea/image003.jpg)/[midline shift](http://www.radiologytutorials.com/getimage.cgi?i=bilder/2/191-1&amp;r=1400)**
     * *Masses* are often subtle on CT
         * More frequently, we see the sequela – vasogenic edema
         * Vasogenic edema respects the grey-white junction
         * This makes white matter look very dark
     * Evaluate for *midline shift*
         * Draw a midline down the skull at the level of the 3rd ventricle or seputum pellucidum
         * The line should intersect those structures
         * If it doesn't measure it and describe it

4. Evaluate the **[ventricular system](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~uzwiak/NBSummer15/NPSpringLect3_files/image022.jpg)**
     * What do the lateral ventricles look like?
     * Are the 3rd ventricle and cerebral aqueduct patent?
     * What do the 4th ventricle and pre-pontine cistern look like (go back to your sagittals if you need to)

5. Evaluate (again) for **extra-axial collections or masses**
6. Double check the **venous sinuses** – sometimes you can see venous sinus thromboses

---------------------------
**Frequently Unasked Questions**

--------------------------

1. So, I don't really remember neuroanatomy... what the fuck are stucture are you talking about? 
    * Shockingly, when I was a PGY-2 I also didn't remember much neuroanatomy from MS1. I think pretty much everyone agrees that this is the best free electronic resource: http://headneckbrainspine.com/
    * I also STILL use this thing on a daily basis, though at this point sometimes it's not detailed enough.

2. What does ""extra-axial"" mean? What is intra-axial?
    * Intraaxial = arising from the brain parenchyma
    * Extra-axial = anything outside of the brain proper, including the lining the covers the brain, vessels in the brain, etc
    * Telling them apart can be difficult sometimes. [Check out this excellent article for further details](http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p47f86aa182b3a/brain-tumor-systematic-approach.html#i47f86b18db49d).

3. What is the difference between vasogenic and cytotoxic edema?
    * [Vasogenic](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/vasogenic-cerebral-oedema) = BBB intact, respects grey-white differenetiation. Think more like brain tumor or abscess.
    * [Cytotoxic](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/cytotoxic-cerebral-oedema) = BBB disrupted, doesn't respect grey-white. Think more like ischemia or other metabolic insult.

4. You talk about both ""windows"" and ""reconstructions"" - what's the difference?
    * Reconstructions = taking the raw data set and making an interpretable image. Different algorithms will give you ""sharper"" or ""blurrier"" images which can make an entire series of images better for looking at the bones or the soft tissues. No amount of windowing around will help you see the soft tissues as well as you can on the other reconstructions. There are many other factors too, like how thick we make the slices and how we acquire the data in the first place.
    * Windowing = Changing the grey-scale color value of images which have already undergone ""reconstruction"" so as to make density differences more or less apparent. [This website](http://regionstraumapro.com/post/16349545265) actually has a really quite excellent ELI10 style explanation.

5. What's your basic negative CT head dictation?
    &gt;There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion/midline shift, or large vascular territory infarct. No abnormal extra-axial fluid collections. The sulci and gyri are well-formed. The grey-white differentiation is preserved. The ventricular system and basal cisterns are normal in size and are patent. The pituitary, corpus callosum, cerebellar vermis, and other visualized midline structures are well-formed and normal in appearance. Posterior fossa structures are unremarkable.


    &gt;Soft tissues are normal. The calvaria are intact. The paranasal sinuses are well-formed and clear. The mastoid air cells are well-pneumatized and clear. The orbits and globes are normal. No significant atherosclerotic disease in the anterior or posterior circulation.

medicine,I just lost my first patient. Why don't I feel anything?,"Please help me understand. I cried when my baby was born. I have lost family members and have felt deep pain. Why don't I feel anything? 

Older gentleman collapsed at rural home. Arrived with emts, asystole from the start. No pulse. Resuscitation per protocol. Declared dead at arrival to Ed. 

Watching the family grieve I feel sympathy and empathy. But I have continued my day without issue. Is this normal? Have I grown callous or is this part of the job. Where is the limit between indifference and inner strength ? 

Edit : thank you all for your input. It seems this is relatively normal and my humanity is still intact. It still is a little shocking to me that I finished my shift, got home, had dinner with my wife and kid, and am now about to go to sleep without being too shook up about the man who died in my hands. I do feel bad for his family -  but from a distance. Like I had heard or read about this happening instead of being covered in his blood. 

I will say this, had he been a child I wouldn't be sober right now. This I know to be true, and with that realisation the possibility of a pediatric specialty for me vanished for good. My respect to you peds. 

A few things of note, in case anyone is interested. I remember thinking we had been attempting to resuscitate too long at the gentleman's house. I figured we had been there for 30-35 minutes.

medicine,Confused - Should I work in England or write USMLEs and go do residency in America - Please advice,"Hi! I am an international student who came to England four years ago to do medschool. I am going to my final year in a few weeks time. It’s the time when doctors to be in the UK apply to foundation jobs and take decisions about where their future will take them. 

So this is my dilemma; a close friend of mine has her heart set on going to the US, she has family there a lot of whom are doctors and has got advice from them. She has told me about all the things she learned about working in the US compared to the UK. The payscale sounds much higher, the time and ease of getting to whichever specialty to want to get to seems higher and also once you work super hard the residency years apparently you can work on your own terms and set your own working hours. Also she told me that one can get a greencard in two years of going there. For all these reasons going to the US after my FY1 having written all the USMLEs and everything seems like an attractive option.

However, I am currently very happy in the UK. It took me a while to settle in here but now I have. I have some family here too and recently met someone as well, who I am very happy with. My plan was initially to do an academic foundation programme and start climbing the ladder until I became a consultant (I’ve not decided my specialty of interest, although I am most attracted to plastic surgery). But now, after speaking to her I am divided and am beginning to think that going to the US may the best option for my future, but I am confused and reluctant to make the decision to prepare for the USMLE and leave because I am so happy with life in England. I need to decide if going to America is worth giving all of it up.

I have to also make this decision as soon as possible because if I decide to aim for the US, my friend and I want to do a joint application for FY1 so we could prepare for it together and head off to US by FY2.

So I have a few questions for you doctors that have any sort of helpful advice that may help me make my decision
1.	How is working life in the US compared to UK?
2.	How significantly is the payscale higher in US than UK?
3.	Is the time taken to get ahead in a particular specialty (for instance plastic surgery) significantly reduced in America compared to england?
4.	Is it really that easy to get a greencard once you do your residency in America?
5.	Also any other benefits of going to US vs staying in England or vice versa.

Feel free to answer all or any of the questions the best you can. Any help is appreciated :)
Thanks for the advice. :)",36,15,2015-08-17,PHARMA,0.026189398020505905,0.8992103934288025,0.0746002346277237

I love both clinical medicine, and the research that drives it. I am heavily considering shooting for an MSTP. However, it is an incredibly intensive and long degree. 

How much is there a balance between the clinical work and lab time? 

Did you do your two degrees in a combined program, or is it possible to have time to accomplish the PhD after obtaining the MD? It's a huge time commitment, especially if I end up wanting to interact with patients more than I will as an MD/PhD.

medicine,Naturopaths try to interrupt my morphine med pass on terminal patient (rant inside),"To begin. I am an RN at a LTC/Rehab facility and I have just had my first run in with two Naturopaths.

Situation: CNA tells me room # is having a hard time breathing and in pain. So I draw up the morphine and grab my pulse-ox and walk down to the room. Upon entering I am greeted by two ""doctors"". I am more focused with getting my patient comfortable again and don't ask the doctors much. I sit the patients head up and put her cannula on her and check her O2 sats. As I am about to give her morphine. One of the ""doctors"" steps in. The ""doctor"" then explains to me that morphine is not natural and that she has some more natural ointments she can use for pain. I pause and think ""wtf, this lady is stage-4 metastasized and knocking on death's door, unless you got some opium in your bag, morphine is her best scheduled option."" I then asked what kind of doctor she was. She responds that she and the other lady are naturopaths. I stop the conversation there. I turn to my patient and told her that the morphine will help with her shortness of breath and pain. The patient has been receiving morphine for weeks so she accepts the medication. 

After this I left the room and told the CNA to keep an eye on the patient. According to the CNA the naturopaths gave the patient some herbal remedies and applied a bunch of different ointments. 

My next interaction with naturopaths was on their way out. They dropped by the nurse's station and tried to pressure me into scheduling all of their ointments and herbal remedies into the patient's MAR. I about lost my shit. Anyways, I told them they needed a real doctor to prescribe their snake oils - of course in nicer terms. 

How are these quacks aloud to use the doctor title?! /end rant

TL;DR: Two naturopaths tried to interrupt me from giving a terminal patient morphine, because it is unnatural. Then tried to get me to schedule their snake oils into the MAR.  

Edit: The naturopaths came into the facility dressed in plain clothes and had visitor badges. Honestly I thought they were friends with the patient and doctors. I just got annoyed with them actually trying to play doctor for the patient. We are not a large facility and do not have security. This was after management had went home. I am a new nurse and I have met most of the patient's doctors, so I knew better than to listen to those quacks.",79,101,2015-08-20,PHARMA,0.13961732387542725,0.837584912776947,0.02279774844646454

pharmacy,"Interviewed to be a Pharm Tech at RiteAid, offered the position and then quickly rescinded due to survey, has this happened to anybody else?","On Monday I was interviewed to be a pharmacy technician at Rite-Aid. My interview went so well that I was able to receive a job offer by the next day. To confirm my employment, employer requested that I complete a ""application survey"" that determines how I would react in certain scenarios. It seemed like a very typical survey, asking if I was honest and if I would ever steal anything or if I would ever engage in an argument with a patient. The possible responses were of the ""strongly agree/disagree, moderately agree/disagree, neutral"" variety and I decided to answer these questions with honesty and integrity.

A couple days pass and I start to worry because I did not receive any calls back regarding employment. Curious, I call back the Rite-Aid and the main pharmacist answers, telling me that they are unable to employ me because of couple of my survey responses. I do not believe I answered any question out of the ordinary of what a typical employer would want, however I felt that perhaps because I answered too truthfully on certain questions that it resulted in the nullification of my application. Apart of the typical questions such as if I would steal or lie to a customer, other questions were ""It is okay to yell at a customer if he/she is being irresponsible"" in which I replied with ""moderately disagree"" rather than ""strongly disagree"" as I can't say for certain I would not do that in every possible circumstance. The head pharmacist said that this was the main reason why they couldn't hire me, which is what I find to be a bit strange. He did say they were waiting on another applicant interview, I think it is more likely that they hired me before they found an even more suitable person to hire. I am just feeling really annoyed because I was offered a position but it was quickly revoked due to a survey that I attempted to answer honestly.

Has this happened to anybody else? I feel that it is incredibly unprofessional of Rite-Aid to offer me a position but then essentially leave me high-and-dry on when I should start working only to find out that I can't be employed by them because of a technical protocol. What is worse is that I can't even apply to any other Rite-Aid locations because this survey is in their system and essentially invalidates me as a suitable employee. I am quite livid.

pharmacy,Question about Walgreens' Pharmacist Behavior - conflicted - advice needed,"Hi all,

I wanted to seek the opinion of professionals before I decide whether I should file a complaint against this particular pharmacist. I'm out of ideas here, so any input is appreciated. I have been visiting a specific Walgreens location for about 9 months and there is one specific pharmacist who I honestly believe intentionally makes my life a living hell. It's odd because the pharmacy manager is the nicest dude and NEVER gives me a hard time, but I didn't want to file a complaint against this woman without some insight. I'm starting to become very frustrated with her constant attitude and lectures when I visit the pharmacy and she happens to be on duty.

So, I'm 27 and I suffer from an aggressive neurodegenerative disorder that will eventually take my life. I take 13 medications, all of which are filled at Walgreens, including several controlled substances (3 CIV and 1 CII). I don't take any benzodiazepines or others that fall within the trinity. Obviously I suffer from pain, so my doctor, who happens to be one of the top clinical neurologists in the US, prescribes me a liberal quantity of Oxycodone 10mg to deal with said pain. There are other controlled substances but they're stuff like Lyrica, Cymbalta (for pain), and Neupro, so it doesn't fall into the spectrum of CII. When the pharmacy manager is on duty, I bring in my prescription and he fills it within 15 minutes - it has the dx directly on the prescription mind you. For reference, I time it so that I pick up all my prescriptions at the same time to avoid multiple trips to the pharmacy which are taxing for me physically. I usually pick up the prescription from my doctor on the 29th day of the cycle. When the other pharmacist is on duty, she tells me it will take 3 days because she needs to ""call the doctor"" and proceeds to lecture me about how I'm too young for narcotic pain relievers or taking too many. I have not complained to the pharmacy manager yet, but after the way I was treated yesterday, I am close to doing so. 

I bring in my prescription as usual and there are 12 others waiting for pick up. She knows who I am, she knows the prescription isn't fraudulent because my medical provider has an automated number where a pharmacist can call and enter the RX# to verify it, or she has the option of speaking to one of the admin staff whom are there 24/7. But that's not good enough for her, she insists on speaking with the doctor; he is a very busy man considering this is one of the best neurological research centers in the US. She's waited the full 3 days before making the call in previous cases, and this was on a Friday. It'd be past my 30 day fill because I don't like requesting it too early. I finally told her it's too difficult for me to make multiple unnecessary trips and that I'll wait, and have my doctor call her within 30 minutes.  So, I'm sitting here thinking ""I really don't have time for this"" and call up the neuro RN directly (yes, I have a direct number) and ask her to have my MDS/Neurologist call Walgreens - he does so within 20 minutes. I'm listening to the pharmacist speak to him and she's asking if this medication was really necessary, and while I couldn't make it out completely, it seems like she was trying to get the quantity reduced. The quantity isn't obscenely high, mind you. I know she's asked these questions before, so it's not as if it is the only occurrence. The RN calls me back after he's spoken with the pharmacist, so I assume everything should be good to go. Nope, she says that she needs to ""verify other information."" What other information? My insurance isn't an issue, I have a medical retirement from the Intelligence Community (former cryptanalyst while I could manage to work) and pay premiums for an EXCELLENT government-wide PPO plan, so I know that's not the case. At this point I can feel my anger increasing so I just walk out before I explode.

And before any skeptics ask ""where's the rest of the story?"" - there is no rest of the story. I don't fill medications early. I don't run out, I have an emergency supply for this very reason. I don't doctor shop. My doctor is very generous and told me if I ever needed a long acting medication + the oxycodone hcl IR, to just ask. I used to be on Opana ER but I didn't want an additional physical dependence, so I stopped it within 5 days even though it greatly improved my quality of life. I'm actually at the point where I put up with high pain levels to avoid dealing with an additional route for this person to hassle me, it makes my quality of life dog poop. My state PMP makes all this very clear for her as do Walgreens' own records, I don't have CII prescriptions from any other doctor other than my MDS/neuro and his RN. I don't have any other narcotic controlled substances. So, there is no other story. I'm fairly certain I would not be treated in this manner if I were a cancer patient.

I'm considering going to speak to the pharmacy manager today because I know he's on duty, he's always super kind to me - he also remembers me by name which is wonderful because it makes me feel like my business is valued. The prescription is sitting in ""under review"" status. I've resorted to calling this woman the ""Wicked Witch of Walgreens"" to friends and family because she causes unnecessary stress for me. I know that you guys deal with BS all day, and I respect what you guys do. However, I feel like this woman is wronging me because, in addition to the manager, there is another pharmacist at this location who fills it immediately. I'm very cordial in person, I've never been rude to her - but it's been difficult to put up with her continuous lectures about this all the while I'm picking up 12 other prescriptions. I don't take these for fun, she can have my illness and the oxycodone if she wants it. I'll happily make that trade so I can have a normal life. However, that's not possible, and this pharmacist is really starting to anger me.

I appreciate any input once again and apologize for the length. I know that you folks have very difficult jobs but I just can't see this behavior as being the norm at all. I've been a sick person for about 8 years, including three years on Oxycodone, and this is the first time I've had to deal with this. She seems vindictive and angry that she doesn't get her way with my doctor, who, once again, is at a major research institution - so it's not a pill mill.

I like Walgreens, they have been really good to me over the years, so I'd prefer not to switch. If I were to switch, I'd either go to a local shop or the pharmacy they have at the medical school here in town. One of the local shops has delivery which would be nice, but again, I'd prefer to avoid it if I can because I have a great relationship with Walgreens.

For reference - I'm not on Oxycodone/APAP, but the IR version with no acetaminophen. I don't know what the brand name is called, my apologies in advance.

Thanks again all. I appreciate what you all do because it's a tough job, but very much needed by folks like me.",78,36,2015-08-22,PHARMA,0.09166585095226765,0.88023242354393,0.028101700358092785

medicine,Remember me? Solo-practice husband barely treading water... UPDATE,"Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/2vjt7j/solo_practitioner_family_medicine_barely_treading/

Just wanted to thank everyone here again for your help and thoughts... and we have a happy update! There's the saying ""you can't keep doing things the same way and expect a different outcome."" Well... we are closing our solo practice and moving to another state. 

After writing the post I did, six months ago, we had some hard conversations about what we wanted our future to look like. If we stayed where we are, doing what we're doing, as time goes on it's only going to get worse. We bought some huge maps of different states we'd be willing to live in, started researching the cities, then calling/googling to see if they were hiring.

Once my husband had some interviews set up we packed up the family and took a couple of road trips. Guess what we found out!! Working for ""the man"" isn't as horrible as it may sound. 4 days a week, 6 weeks of paid vacation, medical, dental (WHAT??), vision (THAT EXISTS??), retirement, housing allowances... the list goes on. YES he will have to work but when he comes home he doesn't have to think about payroll and whether or not we'll meet it: NOT HIS JOB. He isn't required to slave away, either. This organization blocks 30 minute appts so the docs/patients have plenty of time. He can make productivity with what he does above the minimum. It was funny to us, the biggest concern from the places he interviewed was whether or not he'd be happy going from solo to group and not owning his own business. They couldn't understand what a relief it is going to be. Since he has signed on, he's a new man. He's so happy! It's like a weight has been lifted. There's been a ton of work to do on the house and as long as the sun is out, he's out there working to get it done with a smile on his face because the end result is placing that ""for sale"" sign in the yard. 

In 8 years of owning our practice, we have not been on one ""real"" vacation (more than an extended weekend) as a family. When we talk about our future, it seems the paid time off is what he gets the most excited about. But I think it's not just the PTO, it's what it represents -- he can be off work and not have the ownership of our business following him everywhere he goes. 

We still have debt and taxes but have agreed that, as the payments continue to come in once we've closed, all of the funds will go into an account that is only for taxes. We'll get past it and it'll be okay.

We informed our staff last week and we are sending patient letters out TOMORROW. We are excited for the future and he's looking forward to a job he can ""clock out"" from when he gets into his car. It's remarkable to me, to read the post I wrote six months ago and to remember how hopeless it all felt. I'm so thankful that we're able to make this bold move and not look back, wishing we'd given it a try.

We had a great time with the last few groups who despite not being interested in the specialty, worked hard, took a genuine interest in their patients and were just fantastic folks. The nurses loved them, the residents loved them, the patients loved them, we could depend on them. However, this new batch of 8 is just terrible, they come late, leave early, do not round, antagonize the nurses, do not finish up their paperwork. Switch off their pagers, and hide and leave as soon as their shift ends. They keep dumping their work on other people and its just a mess. The residents are already over worked and refuse to take care of the med student's scut on top of their own. Since its not a specialty they are interested in they don't care about their evaluation. How do you guys deal with such people?

pharmacy,Is a residency necessary for everything outside retail?,"Hi r/pharmacy, 
I'm a current P4 student on my third APPE. I'm still not sure exactly what type of job I would like after I graduate, however I am strongly leaning toward something other than retail (especially CVS since my rotation there was stressful). However, after having worked as an intern at a hospital for 2 years I don't think I want to work in hospital either, though this is preferred over retail. I'm not that interested in clinical work, but what I think I really want to do is work in long term care, especially consulting, and maybe home health care. Aside from that I want a job that isn't too stressful (ie. Retail pharmacy), where I can leave my work at work instead of taking it home with me, and hopefully something outside both retail and hospital. Do you all think a residency is required or even recommended for positions that are outside the realm of both retail and hospital? Should I do one just to ensure having job flexibility in the future?
Thanks!

medicine,"""Just go for it!""","As a fourth year medical student, I have been to a lot of career-advising lectures and sessions aimed both at medical students and those who are thinking of going into medicine. A piece of advice that is almost *universally* provided at these types of seminars is that, ""if you are thinking of a field in [insert medical position], just *go* for it!"" 

That statement applies to water slides, roller coasters, a third hot dog, i.e., decisions of no importance whatsoever. You ""just go for"" that last french fry, because what's the worst that could happen? Honestly. What is the *worst case scenario* if you take the last french fry?

It is frankly ridiculous advice for any decision that should have a lot of thought put into it, like whether or not to go to medical school--a 10-12 year process, at *minimum*--or which specialty to choose. You're not going to find a 75 year-old plastic surgeon going, ""well, I'm here cuz someone told me to *just go for it* and boy, I'm pleased as punch I didn't think about it any further beyond that!""

Okay, so I'm salty about being forced to sit through a bunch of lectures where medical doctors with 12-15 years of exorbitantly expensive training are telling me to ""just go for it!"" What's my point?

My point is that when someone asks you for advice about careers in medicine, *have a good answer for them*. I don't mean launch into a 7-paragraph rant about how ridiculous it is that a lot of doctors don't have any good advice; I'm talking about having something to say about the important differences between techs, nurses (RNs and FNPs), PAs, MDs, DOs, etc. and where and how those jobs impact the overall practice.

I'm talking, discuss with these folks the pros and cons of 4 years of undergrad education, 4 years of UME, 3-7 years of residency, and additional years of fellowship training for an MD vs a PA who can get a bachelor's and spend 2 years in school and then be out working. Talk about the projected need (if you know) and what the job market looks like for your specialty and for *fuck's sake* stop moaning about reimbursement, it's shitty *everywhere*. Tell people what you actually enjoy about your day, and when someone asks you why you ended up at a particular hospital or in a particular subspecialty, *tell them.* Saying, ""well, I got hired here"" is factual, but there are very few fields in medicine that are so bereft of employment opportunities that you have to follow the work around like a seasonal field hand.

Anyway, those are my thoughts. I'm interested to hear other people's opinions on how to approach young folks interested in medicine, because I often feel that not enough is done to disseminate information to the people who would most need to know.",57,75,2015-08-26,PHARMA,0.058901187032461166,0.9116978049278259,0.02940107136964798

medicine,"Today I had a patient's relative ask me, ""What do you think of chiropractors?""...","... and my first impulse was to tell them that they're such bullshit, their only application is to fertilise my garden. I can't stand the notion of 'alternative' health for the simple reason that it often thrives on principles which are logically faulty or promotes procedures which aren't rooted in good evidence or reason. But I'm a student, so I have to be diplomatic to some extent and assume I don't know everything. Instead, I expressed a very safe position and stated that chiropractors may differ from one to another and as long as they operate within their scope and according to evidence, avoiding things like spinal manipulation on infants, I don't really have an issue with it.

As it turns out, this person had chronic lower back pain, for which spinal manipulation appears to be proven as effective. After trying mainstream therapy, including physiotherapy and pharmacological approaches, they gave in and went to the chiropractor, who was capable of helping greatly with the pain they experienced. 

There's a growing support for 'natural' medicines and alternative health within the non-scientific community. As a medical student, I feel I may have to deal with this in my career and it seems that mainstream practitioners will have to find a way to co-exist with alternative therapies or risk ostracising patients and turning their care over to alternative practitioners who will cause harm though either incidental or wilful ignorance. 

Can I ask, what are your thoughts and relationships with alternative health as mainstream practitioners? What do you think and how do you go about advising patients about certain fields?

pharmacy,Attempted robbery today... (Long story),"My first day staffing alone. Everything started out great. I had two pharmacy students, two techs, and a clerk. We were talking about how easy the day would be because we had plenty of help for once. I even talked about sending one of the students home an hour early if things were slow. 

11:45am I was back behind some shelves logging the C2 order that had just come in. Unbeknownst to us, 4 men were on their way into the pharmacy; at least one was armed with a pistol. The first man walked up to the outer door of the pharmacy and just stood there smoking a cigarette and talking on his cell phone--presumably casing the place to see if the coast was clear. Three of his friends came in shortly afterward. One stayed just inside the door, and two walked into the lobby area. 

The aggressor of the group paced back and forth with what looked like a prescription in his hand for a few minutes while one of my students, we'll call him Mike, was helping *a young father with his 7 and 9 year old daughters*. 

""Mike"" is 6'2"", probably 220. I'm 6'0"", 220. As soon as Mike finished with this young family, the aggressor jumped the counter, pulled out his gun and started yelling ""Open the register!"". I guess none of us were reacting fast enough so he shoved Mike back towards the shelves in the pharmacy and then started demanding ""Give me the pills!""

To this point I hadn't really heard or seen anything very clearly except a little bit of commotion because I was all the way in the back. Finally when I heard ""Give me the pills"" I came around the far side of the shelving and was met with a gun pointed at my face. He was standing just behind Mike with the gun pointed alternately at me, Mike's head, and two female techs (one of whom is 7 months pregnant) cowering in the corner. 

After the second ""Give me the pills!"" the girls shouted out ""Which ones?!""

He started shoving his ""prescription"" in Mike's face and I started walking forward with my hands up to get the prescription from him to see what he wanted. I guess we were all moving too slow, or Mike and I were bigger than he anticipated, or he was nervous after seeing the recently installed 3 or 4 new security cameras in the pharmacy, so he decided to wind back, pistol-whip Mike (who immediately collapsed to the floor), and then split the same way he came. 

All four then just ran off, past the drive through, across a field and towards an apartment complex just down the road. 

After seeing that Mike was ok, I tripped the silent alarm that is next to my station and then immediately called 911. Police were there within maybe 3 minutes. My boss was there shortly after that (he was my 2nd call). 

We got to check out all the cool footage our new camera system caught. Mike got looked over by a cute paramedic and was fine except for a small cut on his ear and a scrape on his scalp. After 2 hours of talking to police, everyone was sent home for the day. Me, my boss and another employee stayed to close up shop but were home by 3:30pm. 

There is some speculation that he had tried to fire a ""warning shot"", but the gun jammed, or wasn't loaded. The aggressor may have thought Mike had noticed this and wasn't going to cooperate or that me coming forward would put him up against 2 guys much larger than he was. 

Whatever the case, he left without anything, and no one else was hurt. It could have been much, much worse. 

**TL;DR-- Brazen idiot would-be robber jumps the counter, demands cash, demands pills, pistol-whips my intern, then runs away without anything. I will never understand criminals.**",24,42,2015-08-30,PHARMA,0.14776656031608582,0.8242448568344116,0.02798856422305107

medicine,"As someone that traded a medical future for a much more care-free and relatively well paying career, I'm wondering what could have been.","What sort of toll has your career taken on your personal life? Is the immense stress really as constant as people say? Do you ever feel like you've sacrificed your youth and life-long well-being for a medical degree? And most importantly, do you regret dedicating your life to medicine?

I realized I wouldn't be able to cope with this career when the stress, sleep deprivation and inability to sustain myself with miserable paying night work began to make me question the reasons I even bother trying, and got out when the opportunity presented itself. I've lucked out and managed to create a future for myself. Yet I do wonder looking back, amongst the depression and misery that comes with medicine, have I missed out on something truly special?

pharmacy,"Pharmacists, what would you do if store employee needed inhaler/epi pen in an emergency.

Luckily she got her prescriptions from us and had refills so we threw her an inhaler while we put it through the system so it all worked out. 

I asked my pharmacist what she would do if i got stung by something or had an asthma attack. I do not get my prescriptions from my chain nor do I have a prescription for an inhaler or epipen.  (I also have no known allergies or history of asthma so it's super hypothetical). 

She said she'd probably stab me with whatever I needed or give me an inhaler, though technically she really isn't supposed to. She also said she'd probably get in trouble with the chain for either loss prevention, giving drugs without an RX or both. She then looked at me funny, said I was morbid and that she hoped she never had to make that decision.
