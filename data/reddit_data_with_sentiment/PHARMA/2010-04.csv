Health,"HELP! My sister is getting homeopathy treatment from her ""doctor"". How do I demonstrate to her that it is fake?","I just got an email she sent updating me on her medical situation. She has been chronically ill for months now. Seeing several different doctors and going to seminars about her issues. She says she has thyroiditis, or something wrong with her thyroid and pituitary gland.

Her email said she has finally found a solution that her doctor gave her. She took a test, and the results came back, and she's started a homeopathy treatment.

She told me that this energy test shows that she has parasites. She also said that the doctor told her that the parasites are activated by the moon cycles. This is seriously off the wall now, and I want to show her that it's all superstition.

HOWEVER, this is where it gets tough. She is very very set in her ways. She never listens to anyone when they try to correct her. I really need to back this up extremely well. I've found some sites that seem credible, but I'm having a hard time finding A LOT of really good professional sites discrediting it (anything I find on google is just homeopathy web sites that regurgitate the same old garbage so they can sell their ""natural"" remedies.)

What should I tell her? What articles can I show her that break it down very well? Thank you in advance reddit!

EDIT: After reading my post, it seems to me that I'm just looking for stuff against Homeopathy. I don't believe it as a practice, obviously, but I'm not against it being possible. I just haven't seen anything convincing so far. So, please argue for or against homeopathy.",101,15,2010-04-16,PHARMA,0.17196133732795715,0.8011928796768188,0.02684582769870758

Health,"Ask /r/Health, I have a cyst on my inner thigh, no insurance and poor.","This is the second recurrence of this cyst. The first time it came and went in about a week period. It was very painful, but eventually went away. Now, it has come back in the same place and it is very painful, making it difficult to walk / sit / sleep well. 

 It appears to be a [sebaceous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebaceous_cyst) cyst, and it is about 4cm X 3cm and inflated to a height of about 1cm (its quiet large). Since having it surgically removed is not an option, I wrapped it yesterday with a mixture of [yarrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarrow) and [Western Coltsfoot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petasites_frigidus). Today, I wrapped it with [comfry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfry).

 I assume the root cause here is liver toxicity, as I smoke (about half a pack a day) and drink coffee (about a pint a day). So I will address these. My diet consists of *mostly* organic whole-grains, dairy products, and high quality animal fats. 

 Are there any suggestions for alleviating the pain, or some sort of local anesthetic? What other techniques can I employ to reduce my liver toxicity (other than quitting the aforementioned vices)? Any suggestions would be welcome. I put myself at your mercy. TIA",10,2,2010-04-25,PHARMA,0.04399137571454048,0.9220227599143982,0.03398587554693222
