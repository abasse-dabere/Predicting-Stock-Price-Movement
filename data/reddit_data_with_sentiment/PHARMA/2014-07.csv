Regardless of the effectiveness of those, the thought occurs to me that there are a lot of little tricks that we in pharmacy have learned over the years that might be worth sharing with others, maybe you might find something that makes your life that much easier.  

- If you can get your hands on them, a pair of hobby tweezers (the kind with the bent end) are so much easier for getting desiccant out of bottles then then straight ones.

- For large count bottles, keep a running tally on the side of it of how much is left, makes doing a cycle count that much faster.

- At least at CVS, if you know you will need more then 1 label for something, just type the number you need before your credentials, and the system will print out that many labels.

So apparently the supreme court decided that anything that interrupts the ability of a fertilized egg to implant in a uterus is an abortifacient. 

I was looking through the side effects of drugs and thought it was kindof funny how clomiphene can cause thinning of the uterine lining and other side effects in some women, which would also qualify it as an abortifacient. 

Politics aside, what other drugs can affect women in this way? Probably most Preg. Cat. X drugs?

Has anyone here gone from nursing to PA school or med school?  I know there's a negative stigma towards people switching from nursing to medicine, but I'm trying to move towards my goals. Am I screwed with a 3.0? I could use some tips/suggestions as far as getting into PA school.

medicine,"The right doctors, with the wrong training","In a [special opinion piece](http://www.vancouversun.com/opinion/op-ed/Opinion+right+doctors+with+right+training/9995105/story.html) to the Vancouver Sun, Ian Brasg, Gurinder Grewaland and Jesse Kancir spent 13 paragraphs pleading for measures to favour Canadian medical school graduates and extolling the virtues of Canadian medical education.

I am a Canadian medical graduate who is now in family practice, and I'd like to set the record straight.

Let's get one thing clear about the physician labor market in Canada. Specialty practice, with very few exceptions, is saturated. There is no lack of demand for clinical services. However, the healthcare dollars and infrastructure required to support more specialists are not there. 

It's not going to appear out of thin air, either. Unless the provinces collectively come by a lot of money and spend a good portion of it on healthcare, the specialty job market will remain high and dry for at least a few decades to come.

Things are better in family practice. However, as more and more graduates are being funnelled into a system with finite and diminishing resources, similar problems are likely to arise in family practice some years from now.

Now, why would 'qualified' Canadians 'choose' to study medicine abroad? Because many of those who do want to practice medicine don't have a choice. In Canada, the number of medical school  aspirants greatly exceeds the number of training positions available.

This reality has fuelled a frenzied spiral of ever more restrictive criteria for medical school admission - criteria that not every qualified and compassionate student who would be an asset to society and the profession - can meet. Enter foreign medical education.

Unfortunately, the postgraduate medical education system in Canada is not set up to absorb the surplus, which leaves many foreign graduates in a dire predicament - competing against the likes of Ian Brasg, Gurinder Grewaland and Jesse Kancir in a system stacked heavily against foreign graduates.

The arguments these three make with regard to the specialness of Canadian medical education are farcical, being more reflective of labor market tensions and protectionist attitudes than they are of reality. Such nationalistic delusions are popular among Canadian physicians and their regulators in the present day.

The very pervasiveness of these attitudes, however, reflects a sobering underlying reality - hundreds of men and women all dolled up in white coats, with nowhere to go. They are the right doctors, with the wrong training.",6,13,2014-07-03,PHARMA,0.06800153851509094,0.9047189950942993,0.02727949246764183

I am an MS3 a little over half way through my internal medicine core. Yesterday a patient of mine passed away. It was to be expected, given the circumstances, but that's not what has me thinking. 

In this particular case this patient had no family coming to see her in her last hours of life. Not because they were insensitive but because they too were physically disabled and unable to make the journey. So with that in mind: if you know someone is actively dying with no one coming to see them in their last hours, and not knowing exactly how long they have left, what would you do? 

In my case, I knew she was dying, so it seemed unconscionable to me to leave her alone in that room. I spent a few hours sitting with her holding her hand, as much time as I could spare.

pharmacy,Quit your bitching.,"I've been a pharmacy tech for a long time now, and not just at CVS. As far as everyone's ranting goes about how the pharmacy pissed you off, or didn't fill your prescription at the exact moment you needed it, I just have a few pieces of advice.

1. Take your OWN health into your OWN hands. Be responsible for getting your rx's filled BEFORE you completely run out and your doctor is closed, and then I'M the bitch because you were too stupid to realize the fact.

2. Hold your doctors office accountable. I see a thousand people complaining their refills didn't get approved, but how many of you complain to the doctors office that they take too long to respond? (Or simply DON'T respond at all, or throw away the request, or whatever the hell else happens once we send the request.)

3. Know what meds you take, and what they are used for. When you call and ask to 'refill everything', and then come to pick up the 19 prescriptions we filled, yet you only still take 5 of them...we hate you. Or when you call and tell us you need the 'little white pill', don't be surprised if it's not the same little while pill you had intended to pick up. Mind reading is not our specialty.

First let me say that I did a quick search and am aware that a similar post was made 2 years ago, but there was never a reply from a practicing clinical geneticist, so I'm trying again. I'm a medical student that is seriously considering genetics as a specialty. I've had plenty of exposure so far, and I like everything that I've seen and heard, particularly the ability to practice, teach, and research. 

However, there aren't many of you guys floating around, and I'm trying to gather as many perspectives and experiences as possible. SO, if you're out there, how do you feel about your specialty? Are you happy with the pay, lifestyle, mobility, security,  and trajectory? Is there anything you weren't expecting that you know now? I will take as much or as little info as you want to give.

Also, what are your thoughts about combined Peds/Genetics residencies vs. doing a Peds residency and then a Genetics residency? It takes the same amount of time in most circumstances, so is there a benefit to one route or the other?

pharmacy,"Pharmacy students (and pharmacists), For the love of all that is good, learn to speak English!","Let me preface this by saying: I grew up in 3 different countries, I speak 3 languages. I learned one of those languages as an adult, so I know how difficult it can be to learn a new language. 

I'm in my final year of pharmacy school. I have a couple classmates that I do rotations with, and it is extraordinarily difficult to understand either one of them because English is their 2nd language. They mumble, emphasize random words, speak too quickly, and it frequently takes 2 or 3 tries before I understand what the hell they're talking about. 

If you are not good at speaking English:

1. Speak slowly and clearly. If you are humble about it and ask for help, we may even give you a friendly correction if you're stumbling over something. 
2. Practice reading out loud. Again, slowly and clearly.
3. Repeat things people say, both to confirm and to prove that you understand what they said. I've asked these classmates to do things or to get things, and sometimes they'll walk away and I have no idea if they even are aware that I've asked them a question.

I realize that part of the problem here is that pharmacy schools are a huge money maker right now, and in order to fill every fucking seat they have to scrape the bottom of the barrel. 

You may be a genius, but in a high paced, high stakes healthcare environment, you are almost worthless if you cannot communicate in a coherent and intelligible manner.

medicine,My boss and her husband violated HIPAA. I filed a complaint and now I am a little scared. Insight?,"I work as a staff pharmacist for a large retail chain.  My pharmacy manager (also a pharmacist) recently revealed to me that she asked her husband - who works a Cath Lab tech at our local hospital - to look up one of our employee's medical charts to find out why she had recently been hospitalized and had to miss a week's worth of work.  Well, the two of them found out that the reason our employee had been hospitalized was due to a suicide attempt.  This made my boss extremely angry.  She ended up telling me that she was decreasing our employee's hours and trying to get her fired because she was ""done with her and if she is emotionally unstable, then she doesn't need to be in a pharmacy.""  I asked my boss why she thought that it was any of her business as to why our employee was sick from work and she said ""it is my business as long as it impacts my business.  Of course, I can't tell our district manager how I know this about her but I want her fired.""  I feel horrible for the poor employee.  I am totally stunned that my boss did this.  I have considered just talking to my boss but I don't think she cares about violating the employee's privacy.  I ended up submitting a complaint with the Dept of Health and Human Services but now I am scared that I will somehow lose my job or be targeted by my boss.  Has anyone had any experience with filing complaints and how it has worked out for everyone?  Can they even prove that her husband looked up my employee's chart?

""oh, ok"" he says, and shifts over with a-sheet-moving-over-the-bed type squeak.

""No problem."" says I, as I maybe didn't make myself clear.

Turns out that was NOT a sheet-squeak.  As I have my head positioned over his knee to do the lachman, a wave of nauseating, sulfuric, ripe fart wafts over my very being.

Now what to do?  Drop his knee and run from the room?  Pretend I heard an overhead call for me?

I decided to stick it out.  It was hard to complete the examination or give him any cogent advice given the atmosphere, but I managed to mumble something about ""no serious problem"" ""see your family doctor"" and then high-tailed it out of there to clear air.

medicine,Dealing with Fainting in the Hospital,"I really hope I can ask this here. If, not let me know!

So I am a premed student, going into my sophomore year of college. This summer I am working in a lab at a hospital, and occasionally get to shadow our lab PI when she's doing clinical rounds. Earlier today, I shadowed her for the first time. Initially, I was fine, but after seeing several stroke patients, I began to feel dizzy and faint. I tried eating something in a break room, but when I returned I only made it through a few more patients before feeling lightheaded again. Similar episodes have occurred when watching surgery on animals in the lab, and the doctor/lab PI has expressed concern over my ability to be a doctor, given my tendency to ""go vagal"" in certain settings. She was very nice about it, and said that she would take me on a few more rounds in the future to see if I get used to it, and that she would help me figure something out if I don't. I've wanted to be a doctor for most of my life, and don't have the faintest clue about what other professions I could pursue outside of medicine.

Has anyone had similar experiences and been able to overcome it? Any advice on how to make it through my next clinical shadowing experience?

medicine,Most Gratifying Experience with a Patient,"I thought perhaps we could take a moment to reflect on the positive things that make medicine a worthwhile endeavor. Those experiences that reminded us - for whatever reason - ""oh, this is why I'm here.""

I'll share mine, though it's short and trite and maybe not that inspiring. I'm still just an MS, so it's not quite clinical. 

I was doing some QI work in a major AMC and had a patient enrolled in a cancer trial. She'd come in for a biopsy, and been bounced around from office to office all day, before finally getting jabbed and being sent on her way: probably, all said, about 7 hours in. At this point she was frustrated and angry, and so were her sister and husband, but the patient was too shy to say or do anything.

I came in wearing my ""QI Hat"" (although this had shit fucking all to do with the project I was gathering data for), and asked her, and her particularly, to tell me about her experience that day, what could be done better, what could be done worse. I gave this shy, meek woman permission to vent at me - as hard as she could vent, at least - about how she'd been dehumanized, and treated as a research subject. I apologized, nearly groveled, at how her day had gone awry, told her that I would be running it straight up the flagpole in the QI department (which I didn't work for, so... not so much), and gave her the number to join our patient board (which surprisingly, that hospital really took seriously). Once she'd deflated, I reassured her that I, too, have a chronic illness, and that for all its failings, I'd never been in a better hospital, and that she really was getting the best care possible (also pretty true).

And she just seemed, well, lighter. Not happy. Not grateful. Just lighter. 

If she'd attacked or gone on the offensive, especially unprovoked, I probably would have felt a lot differently. But she was just clearly the sort of person who would keep it all in until she burst. I gave her an excuse to deflate some, I took no real heat, and she just went home a little happier, a little more content with the care she was getting.

I've had more *positive* interactions with patients, more *pleasant* ones, but that's the one that sticks out in my mind as ""this is why I'm here."" What's your story?",32,54,2014-07-19,PHARMA,0.07615138590335846,0.8900677561759949,0.03378090262413025

I've spent many hours listening to speakers, counsels, caucuses, and committees on the topic. It's been a truly amazing thing to witness a piece of history. Here is the official AOA statement.

""AOA House of Delegates Votes to Support Single GME Accreditation System
Delegates representing the nation’s more than 104,000 osteopathic physicians and osteopathic medical students voted today to support a decision by the AOA Board of Trustees to pursue a new, single accreditation system for graduate medical education.

This historic vote during the annual meeting of the AOA House of Delegates comes after an announcement in February that the AOA, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) had reached an agreement to work together to prepare future generations of physicians.

When fully implemented in July 2020, the new system will allow graduates of osteopathic and allopathic medical schools to complete their residency and/or fellowship education in ACGME-accredited programs and demonstrate achievement of common milestones and competencies.

The AOA strongly believes the public will benefit from a single standardized system to evaluate the effectiveness of GME programs for producing competent physicians. Through osteopathic-focused residency programs, the new GME accreditation system will recognize the unique principles and practices of the osteopathic medical profession and its contributions to health care in the U.S.

For more information on the single GME accreditation system, visit www.osteopathic.org/singleGME[1] .

medicine,Foreign Physicians: How do you handle drug seekers in your country?,"At the few clinics/ hospital I've worked at, drug seeking seems to be a topic ignored and silently tolerated. In the hospital, we naturally assume the person is actually sick, do the proper tests, find out they have nothing wrong with them and then typically discharge them with a couple pills of their preferred narcotic. We do this with no thought of their many return visits with similar results.

In private clinic, it can be a bit different, where the physicians can choose to deny writing scripts for narcotics and/or refer to pain specialist. However, I've known a few physicians who eventually gave in to people who I had my suspicions about even though they state they will refuse to prescribe narcotics.

I am just curious to know if other countries react this way (and domestically if anyone has a good system), or if some have a systematic approach. Perhaps with drug counselling or social programs they turn to.

medicine,Introducing /r/MedicalPorn,"I received moderation privileges to an abandon subreddit that Im trying to revive and set up a community around. My goal is to shape /r/MedicalPorn in to an image subreddit on the like /u/EarthPorn and other similar [SFW (Safe for work) porn subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/user/kjoneslol/m/sfwpornnetwork).

Today Im inviting you to come to /r/MedicalPorn and be apart of the revamped community and browse and submit. In fairness there isn’t anything there at the moment but I’m hopping you can change that.
