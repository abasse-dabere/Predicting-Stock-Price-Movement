medicine,Doctors without borders,"I think all of you are familiar with this foundation. 
I graduated medschool this summer and in two weeks from now I'll be taking my residency exam that will allow me to choose a specialty.

 

I've always been fascinated about doctors without borders and I want to be a part of it too. Unfortunately for me, they need you to have a minimum of 2 years experience before enrolling. 



Did any of you work for them? 



Can you share with us your experience?



Is it dangerous? (in my country even working in a normal hospital could be dangerous)



Is it worth it? I'm not talking solely about the money here.



Is it that hard/ exhausting? 



Do you encounter extreme cases? 



Do people that you're helping respect you? (here, 80% of the pacients treat the doctors like shit)



And at the end of the day do you have time to rest for a bit and go to sleep or is just non-stop work? 




I am asking this because I'm really interested in enrolling as soon as I meet the requirements. I've always wanted to do this because I always thought that there are some people out there with little to no access to medical services but with a real need for them. 


I'm not one of those guys chasing a career that's going to bring me a lot of money and a resounding name in my city. I'm gonna let others fight for that sort of stuff. 


I come from a family with roots in medicine. I've actually got to grow up in hospitals looking around. I also got to see both of my parents fight the system everyday, face death threats, insults, low payment, salary cuts and so on. It is disgusting and I don't want to be a part of this, but I want to fulfill my role and help people that are in need.",54,124,2015-11-01,PHARMA,0.07138138264417648,0.8915603160858154,0.03705834597349167

Doctor wrote for 11 refills, so she must expect us to use the inhaler frequently enough to warrant that many refills, right? That was what we thought, anyway.

Her pharmacist took note of the frequent inhaler refills and actually called her doctor, unbeknownst to us. He noticed a couple things. He requested that she be prescribed the 5mg Montelukast (because her doctor hadn't noticed that she was old enough for the increased dose and had put all refills in at 4mg), and also let the doctor know that the albuterol as needed was apparently not working well, as we were refilling the inhaler every month and that she would probably benefit from a maintenance inhaler. Her doctor changed her Montelukast to the increased dose, and put in a prescription for a Flovent inhaler. 

This month has been night and day. Very drastic improvement. She has energy in spades, is running around all the time, doesn't cough throughout the night,no wheezing, and hasn't used her albuterol at all this month. 

We want the pharmacist to know we appreciate him stepping in and advocating for her, when we didn't know to do so. We do not, however, want to cross any ethical lines or make him uncomfortable, so I thought I'd ask here. Is it generally okay to get him a thank you gift or recognize him for this or would that be weird? If it is okay, is there a universally appreciated gesture or would anything go? If it's not okay, how can we make sure he is somehow pat on the back for this, aside from just saying ""thanks""... we feel like he went above and beyond and needs to be thanked in a way that is equivalent.",43,81,2015-11-07,PHARMA,0.042676229029893875,0.9040491580963135,0.05327465385198593

medicine,"[Question] If the cone cells of our eyes are continuously depolarising until they sense light, does that mean, technically, that sleeping/resting our eyes is actually more resource intensive?","Hey there, /r/medicine!

I'm a med student from Germany and I've been studying for my first neuroanatomy-test. This might be a stupid question, especially since my understanding of the subject matter is pretty basic (I'm in first year and this is my first test ever).
So, as I understand it, the cones in our retina are continuously depolarising as long as they don't sense any light, which mean's they're continuously releasing Glutamate into the synapses they share with their bipolar neurons. Only there it is decided whether an action potential is actually being passed on, depending on whether they're On- or Off-Center cells.
Okay, so I can see this system working. I don't know why it's so overly complicated (though I've already learned that the human body seems to prefer doing things the not-so optimal way) but I get that it works.
But continuously releasing neurotransmitters seems like a very resource intensive task to me. They have to be built (even with continuous re-uptake), put into vesicles, transported to the synaptic gap - all of this requires a whole bunch of ATP, doesn't it?

So, my question is as I said above. I get that when we say ""resting our eyes"" we primarily mean the respective muscles but is it actually the case that when being in a dark room our eyes are requiring more energy that they would if they actually had something to look at?

A couple things:

* Are there any differences between the different types of tubes from my point of view?

* We can generally change the medication from liquid, tablet, capsule, odt, whatever without calling anyone, most of the Rx are just things like ""Gabapentin 200mg bid."" And I know I can choose gabapentin liquid or capsules or tablets.

medicine,Interesting case of ataxia in a young person.,"(For HIPAA reasons, I'm changing some demographics). Recently I admitted a 20 year old woman with ""weakness and numbness in her legs"" and not able to walk.  Turns out she has dysmetria of the legs (L worse than R) and, pretty much full strength (except some weaker L dorsiflexion). Normal reflexes and sensation (I didn't bust out the tuning fork to test for vibration since I didn't have it on me, wasn't there just a post about when it's useful?).  Tells me through the interpreter that she has been using N2O (AKA nitrous oxide/whippets) every day for the last year.  Also some urinary incontinence and memory issues.  Interestingly the trouble walking in her words only really started 2-3 days ago.  I asked Dr. Google ""nitrous oxide and ataxia"" and found tons of case reports about posterior column issues in the setting of B12 deficiency.  Sure enough, she has an elevated MCV and RDW (although Hct normal).  So I think she has nitrous oxide induced ataxia.  B12 came back low and I'm repleting her with IM B12.  

I asked a colleague about this and he was saying that he admitted a young guy about a month ago with the same thing.  This is the first time I've heard of this, anybody else seen this?

pharmacy,Prescription from 1921 - Can anyone tell what it's for?,"http://imgur.com/OYmWqEG

Had an older patient bring in the script today. She found it while cleaning out her grandmother's belongings and thought we'd find it interesting and be able to figure out what it was for. Looks like it was dated for 4-9-1921 and the patient said that was the day after her mother was born. 

Unfortunately, I'm kinda stumped. Given the date and timing it kinda looks like a combination of opium, theobromine, and hyoscyamine? But I'm honestly not sure.

I feel so stupid. I end up being moved to pick-up for five or six hours at a time, because I'm too slow at production. I ask the same questions because the answers just don't stick with me, maybe because I don't get a chance to utilize them. I try to take notes, but a lot of the time, it seems like I don't have time to take notes because we're too busy. 

I feel like the pharmacist thinks I'm an idiot. He tells me that I'm careless when I make mistakes. I'm trying as hard as I can, but it feels like I'm being constantly corrected even before I make a mistake.

medicine,medical legal question for a relatively new physician assistant,"hi guys.  i've been a PA for a little over a year.  i worked temp urgent care jobs for my first year practicing, but just about 3 weeks ago i got a new job at an outpatient ortho clinic.  the clinic contracts out with a physical therapist, chiropractor, accupuncturist, nutritionist, massage therapist, and myself.  i've only met the doctor that owns the clinic once.  anyways, i'm becoming increasingly uneasy and concerned with the way medicine is being practiced there.  profit seems to dictate almost all the medical decisions made.  patients are coached up to come up with multiple physical ailments, even if they really only come into the clinic to get treated for one thing (e.g. a woman comes in for knee pain, but x-rays are taken and she's determined to have knee pain, back pain, neck pain, and ankle pain.  a history is taken and physical exam is performed and the patient is given the diagnosis based on the x-ray even if the exam is normal.  the person doing the exam will tell the patient that the more stuff that they can think up, the more likely their insurance is to pay for stuff).  i don't think that an x-ray without symptoms is that big of a deal for stuff like mild arthritis.  
my job there is to sign off on the diagnosis sheets, and occasionally do physicals.  i've been scolded by the management for not coming up with enough diagnoses when i do physical exams because they say insurance won't pay for stuff.  i'm also doing ultrasound injections on joints for people that don't have any pain.  they only have x-rays suggestive of mild arthritis.  it's my understanding that most adults over 40 will have mild arthrits in their knees.  they're also asking me to do ultrasound-guided injections even though i don't know how.  they instructed me to take a picture of the joint, turn the ultrasound off, and then inject.  i've seen ultrasound-guided injections before and that's not how it's done.  my two bosses are a doctor and a physical therapist and i'm really concerned that i may be committing fraud and i'll lose my license.  is this normal for private clinics or did i find a bad one?  i'm going to quit, but i'm wondering what kind of trouble i can get in for all the stuff i've done for the last 3 weeks?  i really hope this doesn't end up costing me my license or following me for a long time

tldr: i think the clinic i work at is committing fraud and as a result, so have i for the past 3 weeks.  will i get in trouble if i quit now?",9,22,2015-11-14,PHARMA,0.2691725492477417,0.7019991874694824,0.02882823720574379

medicine,What's the best direction I can go in if I wish to end up doing cancer research?,"Hey guys, sorry if this is in the wrong sub--I just thought it was the most fitting for my question.

I'm a final semester materials engineering undergraduate who's really set on continuing his education into the higher levels so I may become heavily involved in research.  Specifically, I want to go into cancer research, and due to my background, I've sent myself in the direction of applying to PhD programs at schools where there is an active cancer research community for their materials department (since I've sincerely enjoyed what I've learned and done thus far with my undergrad). 

My boyfriend is a medical student, and whenever this conversation comes up he always ""jokes"" about how I should consider going to medical school if I'm so interested in cancer, become a heme/oncologist, and get involved in research that way since it'd probably get me much farther than if I were just a PhD engineer.  

So, really, I'm just wondering what meddit has to say about this.  Would an MD be favorable over a Materials Science and Engineering PhD?  Again, I have my heart set on research, so I'm just confused as to which way would provide me the best results (and ultimately, qualifications, I guess) for where I want to end up in the future.

medicine,How did you as a physician develop a good approach to histories and differentials?,"As a third year medical student, I often feel a huge disconnect between my theoretical knowledge base and applying that knowledge. For instance, I know a lot of information about lets say UTI. But if a patient comes in with symptoms of UTI, I don't know how to approach my differential and then structure my history to address all these things I've thought of on my ddx!

I know a lot of it experience - hence clerkship and residency. But I also find I don't know where to start - if I'm supposed to learn by practicing, how exactly do I structure this ""practice"". So do any experienced physicians have a good approach?

Currently, I think of my differential from a system based and VINDICATE acronym based approach. I do systems and then VINDICATE for each. I then ask this on review of systems. But it's really lengthy, can get me disorganized and doesn't work on OSCE's where you need to be fast and efficient as well as organized.

pharmacy,Joint Commission Releases New Proposed Measure for Antimicrobial Stewardship,"The Joint Commission posted the draft of its Proposed New Standard for Antimicrobial Stewardship yesterday.

It looks like it will have a wide reach, applying to ambulatory health care, nursing care centers, critical access hospitals, hospitals, and office-based surgery practices. Also, Pharmacists are expected to be a member of the stewardship team ""when available in the setting."" It seems like this measure may impact a lot of people across many healthcare settings. I myself am excited about the possible impact on prescribing it may lead to in the ambulatory and nursing care settings. The office-based surgical practice piece is a nice touch.

If you are interested in reading the measure, the link is below. If you feel strongly about it and want to let the Joint Commission know, you can do that through the link below as well! The measure is open for public review and comment through December 30th.

I'm a penultimate year medical student from Melbourne, Australia doing my final year in 2016. I had organised to do a 6 week elective rotation of in orthopaedics but unfortunately this has since fallen through as the supervisor had some personal commitments just crop up. 

I know this is probably a long shot, but I was wondering if any UK doctors would be willing to let me shadow them from 14th Mar - 22nd Apr 2016 as I have already paid a deposit on my flight to London. I've a broad interest in both medicine and surgery, and I would honestly be willing to do my elective in any specialty (save pathology maybe)! 

Indemnity is covered for by my university/state, and the reason I have to arrange it far in advance is because my university has a deadline to submit our elective plans by the 31st of Dec 2015. 
I understand also that this period (14th Mar - 22nd Apr) is around Easter break, but hopefully most doctors are still working through...

I guess I'm not asking about the big foundational beliefs like not vaccinating or belief in homeopathy -- those would have to be dealt with in an ongoing patient relationship, but it tends to poison the interaction off the bat if I were to bring them up in a 10-minute visit focused on a sprained ankle. The kinds of things I run into regularly are:

""Oh, my temperature is usually really low, so 98.2 *is actually a fever for me""*

""I'm immune to that antibiotic""

""I'll be sure to sleep in a different bed so I don't spread my poison ivy to my husband""

""This felt like a cold at first, but it's been THREE DAYS and hasn't gone away, so it must be something else!""

And, of course, a bunch more.

pharmacy,Explain multiple brands to 1 generic,"[page of orange book](http://imgur.com/kMKT3lv)

Ok I'm a pharmacy tech, and there is something that really confuses me. How can two brand names, Synthroid and Levoxyl, be both equivalent to say levothyroxine Mylan brand, but not be equivalent to each other?  This seems to fly in the face of logic, like if a = b= c, then a =c is also true.  

I think this has something to do with bioequivalence, meaning that Synthroid and Levoxyl are different enough from each other to be separate, but both are within boundaries for the mylan generic? 

Another example:  Proair, Ventolin, Proair.  all albuterol HFA, apparently not equivalent. 
So if rx says albuterol HFA, we can dispense any of the above.  Albuterol HFA = (a,b,c)  but a b c are not equal to each other?  is this due to it not being tested?  or what the heck?  

Using logic, none of this is comprehensible.",6,10,2015-11-26,PHARMA,0.02566526271402836,0.9372496008872986,0.037085097283124924

Lately here has been a huge increase in strange Russian products. One of them is umckaloabo plant extract. Which is not terrible on it's own, but the fact that is advertised as a ""natural antibiotic"" gives me a headache :D Now, every other time, when I decide to prescribe antibiotics I am asked ""can't we just use that extract? Won't it be much safier? We do not whant your pig pharma drugs"". 
And no mater what I do, I can't argue with the propaganda machine.

So I've decided to plant the actual plant in my office (we can have plants at most workplaces) and put a pair of google eyes on each leaf everytime anybody asks ""what about that extract"". It's much more fun to explain to the patient what antibiotics actually are and the kids seem to like it, too.
