Ebay,Just another example. Do not yield.,,14,40,2017-06-01,EBAY,0.06527787446975708,0.8858445882797241,0.048877544701099396
Ebay,Is anyone else sick of eBay aiding in fraud?,"I've multiple instances now of a buyer committing mail fraud through false returns, and me presenting eBay with proof of such fraud, only to have them tell me that I'm SOL, that despite proof of fraud (and mail fraud being a federal felony), they will be taking money from my account to give to the fraudster and will penalize me for it in the form of larger listing fees. When asked why they would take my money and give it to the scammer when they acknowledge that fraud occurred, I was told that this is simply how they do things, and I just have to deal with it.

This, strictly speaking, isn't legal. They knew fraud was occurring, said fraud could not have occurred without their help, and by ignoring that and specifically helping the fraud to occur, they have aided in an interstate felony. Aiding in a felony is, generally speaking, as illegal as the original felony itself.

This is more than a few incidences, this is a pattern: I've had personal threats made against me (usually accompanied by a delightful mix of diametrically opposite racial slurs) by a few customers through eBays system, which again is a felony, and again, eBays response is to tell me I'm SOL. They refuse to punish any buyer, regardless of their behavior or crimes committed, and there is no way to even leave a warning for future sellers with a bad review. Sure they have a ""report buyer"" button... but I've never even heard of anyone getting a response through that, much less the abusive buyer being penalized.

If eBay was a normal storefront, or if PayPal was a real bank or credit card processor, I would not be forced to give a return when the customer mails back an empty box; if a scammer wanted to try that they'd have to open a chargeback, which I would dispute, and would end up in small claims, which would end in my favor. The scammer would be responsible for court fees and no one, not the card processor or the storefront or me, will have lost money.

Instead every eBay seller is forced to pay for these scams out of pocket, and eBay acts like this is a normal cost of business. No, it is not. Most stores, when given a return consisting of an empty box, simply do not give the money for the original purchase back. Why would they? 

It's astounding to me the number of folks who will order something online, give a stranger their name and address, and then proceed to make threats and try to scam them, but what I really can't believe is that eBay actually goes out of its way to aid and abet these criminals to the detriment of its real customers, the sellers who pay their fees and generate 100% of eBay corps profit. 

I know I'm not the only one they treat this way, and it is highly illegal (not to mention that PayPal is still using their bs ""holding period"" to generate money off of the interest from your withheld funds, despite the huge lawsuit against them last year for that same illegal practice) - Anyone down for a class action? If enough of us get together, we can take them to big boy court and force them to change their policies. As it is, I can personally only take them to small claims, which may get some of the money they stole from me back, but will not likely effect any real change in their operations.

If your state allows it; record your phone calls with eBays customer service. Every recording we have of them insisting upon helping a known scammer commit fraud is another nail in the coffin. Their official corporate policy of stealing our money to give to known scammers is illegal, and has to stop.",16,13,2017-06-01,EBAY,0.13670942187309265,0.840583324432373,0.022707272320985794

Ebay,is this SNAD?,"I found a new SSD for my computer on Monday and ordered it as my existing SSD is failing.  It was $399 OEM where retail was $499.  I thought from the auction I was buying a Samsung product just not in retail packaging which is what I've found OEM to be in the past.  

I received the drive this morning and installed it.  I immediately ran into issues as I wanted to check/update the firmware and duplicate my existing boot drive over to this drive.  I had the software Samsung provides already installed and ready to go however none of it recognized the SSD.  

I called Samsung and was told this wasn't their product and to go back to the seller for assistance.  I reached out to the seller and was told their ""OEM"" means that Samsung has nothing to do with the product and all support routes through them.  Additionally because its OEM its blocked from being used with Samsung software.  The message went on to state that I should speak with one of their Techs who can help me accomplish what I'm looking  for.  This made me uneasy as I don't really want to have to relie on a company I've never heard of or seen before to warranty and support a rather expensive product.  Regardless I tried to call them and instead of a phone system or live person I ended up in voicemail.  That was enough for me to want nothing to do with this.  

My concern is that they have a 20% restocking fee referenced on the auction and I really don't want to give them $100 after I feel as though material information was left out of the auction page.  They referenced a line that says to call them for clarification of OEM but why would i do that unless there was something advising me that this was going to be significantly different than previous interactions?",15,5,2017-06-01,EBAY,0.0505133755505085,0.916841447353363,0.03264513611793518

Ebay,Time to Lawyer Up,"Some of you may have seen me mention this elsewhere, but back just before Christmas, I had a buyer purchase a watch for $2,400. It was shipped. Delivered. No problems.

Then suddenly out of nowhere 3 months later, the buyer files a chargeback with their credit card stating that the item was not as described. No eBay message. No PayPal case. Just a chargeback.

We submit the tracking information to PayPal and they basically tell me we're up a creek because their seller protection doesn't cover chargebacks for ""Not As Described"". The only thing they say they can do is try to argue with the buyer's bank on our behalf, but as they have no leverage, it wasn't likely to work.

Well, finally today PayPal gave up on trying to fight that for us and gave up. So now the buyer has the item *and* the money.

Only thing we can do now is get a lawyer and go after this guy...

Ebay,"My experiences with PayPal and the awful ""charge back""","PayPal gets a lot of deserved hate but their phone customer service has been excellent each time I've called. The wait time is terrible but when they finally take you off hold, they get shit done (at least in my experience).

Initially, PayPal sides with the buyer 100% of the time and does exactly jack shit to investigate until you call them. The buyer complains, PayPal ""holds"" the disputed funds, and then you just wait...

One time, I had a buyer claim he hadn't received the eBay item. I had a tracking number to prove it was delivered to his registered address. They held those funds for a month before I decided to call and explain. Within five minutes, they restored the funds and closed the case.

Two months ago, I sold a $400 item and today I get a hold (putting me at a negative balance). The buyer claimed it was an ""unauthorized purchase"". Tracking information showed it was delivered and I even requested and received a picture of his signature confirmation (takes 2 minutes on the USPS website). I called PayPal to explain, they took my side immediately and released the hold. The representative even told me the tracking number is all that was required and signature confirmation isn't necessary until ~$800ish (someone please correct me on that). Had I not called, this could still be in limbo for weeks.

Ebay,"Item marked as sold, but buyer is not paying, tried to contact me off eBay","Hi there! So, I'm a new eBay user, I've sold a few expensive racing bicycles on eBay before and have had nothing but positive experiences. Until yesterday when I posted my MacMini as a ""buy it now"", fixed price sale. I received an offer from a buyer for rough $50 more than the asking price, so I counter offered them to pay the original asking price using the buy it now feature. I was hoping this would deter them as I assumed they were probably trying to scam me.

The potential buyer then ""bought"" it but did not submit a payment. Currently the item is showing ""sold-awaiting payment"".

(This is only a $13 item and there have been no other shenanigans so I don't think anything on my end has been compromised.)

I called Ebay support and they were able to confirm that I hadn't refunded anything through Ebay - they called it an ""admin refund"" and said it was from the Paypal side and I had to call Paypal support.  Currently in the 3-4 hour queue to get a callback.

Anyone else encounter something like this?

===================

**6/5 Update:** Paypal support were able to clarify that what happened in my case was apparently the credit card verification failed.  They recommended I have the customer double-check their credit card details in case something was entered wrong, else contact the card-issuer for assistance.

I communicated that to the customer, who was quite skeptical but said they would look into it.  I'm not sure how the card can be charged, and *then* fail verification.  I'm not sure why the system lists it as ""refunded"" everywhere, which is _incredibly_ confusing for everyone involved.

But that's where things sit.  The customer subsequently asked me to try resending an invoice, which I did yesterday night.  Haven't received payment yet, nor any further ""refunds"".

**6/6 Update:**  The buyer is now asking for my email address so they can ""send payment via Paypal"", which is  of course classic scam behavior.  I instead re-sent them an invoice, but I have a feeling this one isn't going anywhere.  I don't know why someone would bother scamming for a $13 wood trinket though...",2,7,2017-06-04,EBAY,0.1484098732471466,0.8287056684494019,0.022884491831064224

Ebay,Confused about this situation. Am I getting scammed?,"Hey, so a couple of days ago I bought a copy of GTA V on eBay for pretty cheap, about 20$. It was soon marked shipped, but when I went to tracking, the seller never actually gave usps the package - they had just created the label. 

Later, I get an email from the seller:

""You have bought an item off me on eBay. The grand theft auto 5. PayPal is saying that you need to confirm your PayPal account. If you could, please do this and I will ship your item. If you have any question don't hesitate to ask.""

This is confusing me for several reasons:

1. She didn't send the email through eBay, she sent it to my personal email.

2. My PayPal account was confirmed years ago. I've bought dozens of items just in the past year using it, most recently last week.

3. I didn't even use my PayPal account on this transaction, I paid directly through my credit card.

Ebay,Confused about how to handle this out of stock situation,"I wanted to buy a rug from Overstock.com, but they were out of stock.

I then got a message from the seller saying that they were out of stock, a request to cancel the transaction, and a refund of my payment. I declined the request to cancel and sent a message asking him to ship the rug when it's back in stock.

Well it's showing as back in stock today on Overstock.com, but it's $30 more expensive than the price I bought it for on ebay. The seller clearly violated ebay's TOS by listing an item for sale that he didn't have. I'd like to get the rug at the cost that I bought it for, but he already refunded me.

- One buyer send me 10 back-to-back messages complaining about the sleeves of a shirt .

I apologized, offered a return for refund (that she did not pursue) and ended up with a neutral. 

- One blocked bidder creating a second account to purchase the item and leave a spite neg. Thankfully she was bright enough to email me via eBay telling me what she was planning to do, so it only took me 4 calls to customer service to find someone with enough sense to remove it.

Ebay,Not sure how to deal with situation as a buyer.,"Hi, so I bought this kinda rare hockey card and 9 days after the purchase the seller sends me this:

&gt; Hi, I received an email from a buyer saying goes they got your card. Let me know if you got their card and I will paypal money for you to send it back and I'll get your card on its way to you. Sorry for the inconvenience and have a good day.

I replied the same day with this:

&gt; Hi, I've received a couple of orders today but everything seems to be correct. Could you tell me what card are we looking for? I'll keep an eye open for something I didn't order of course but just to be sure. I'll contact you as soon as possible if I get anything.

I remembered him only selling the team I collect and went on a shopping spree that weekend, so in the small chance that the other buyer had bought one of the same cards as me, I asked what it was and he replied couple of minutes after with this:

&gt; The card would be a ZZZ. If you do happen to get it, please let me know. I'll be getting your card out as soon as possible. Thankfully the person who did get it will mail it directly to you to save me a little postage. I'll be in contact to let you know when they have mailed it out. Sorry for the inconvenience and I appreciate the help with this.

9 days later, 18 days after the purchase he sends me this:

&gt; So it appears that the person I sent your card to by accident has lost it unfortunately. I've issued a refund to you in full for the card though it's showing as pending at the moment in my paypal account for some reason but should get to you soon. I'm sorry about this whole mess and still not sure how it happened. The most puzzling part is how your card got to the states at the same time as the other card I sent the guy that was shipped express shipping for $35. I only paid the $2.03 for shipping withing Canada for your card

He did issue a refund on paypal but I still feel like I'm getting pulled a fast one here, I could understand if I had got the other guys card but he received both, how can he give me a price to the exact penny on how much he paid for my shipping and never receive anything from him?. If what as been said is true, I see 2 possibilities that don't make sense, either he shipped both cards in the 35$ envelope and there's an empty 2.03$ envelope with my name on it lost somewhere or he put the other guys address on the 2.03$ envelope and it somehow made it all the way to wherever the other guy lives in the States.

And now the other guy has ""lost it"" really?

I'm not so sure where I should go from there, I never had any problems on ebay, what are my options if any, advice is appreciated.

Ebay,"Clicking ""See Details"" on a return case automatically approves then sends refund, skipping several steps.","This glitch has happened to me a couple times now. Once when I meant to grant a return, and another time when a scammer was trying to pull an empty box scam.

I go to the resolution center, click ""see details"" for a case, and am greeted with ""Thanks, a refund has been sent"". They skipped the part where I get to see the details of the case, skipped the part where I can approved a return or contact the buyer, skipped waiting for the returns tracking to show delivery, and went straight to giving them a refund.

I returned back one page, to verify which button I pressed, and the only link that had been clicked was ""see details"". There were no pages between ""thanks, a refund has been sent"" and the one with ""see details"" - the details page should have loaded, but instead the ""see details"" link went straight to granting refund.

I called customer service, they told me that there wasn't anything they could do since I approved the refund. When told that no, I did not approve the refund, and provided screen shots showing this, they told me there was nothing they could do. When asked if they could connect me to tech support, since this is a glitch on their end, and needs fixing, they said no such department exists.

No tech department. For eBay. If they weren't in India I'd go to the customer service warehouse and kick their lying butts.

Since I can't get ahold of anyone actually helpful, I thought I'd bring it here in the hopes it catching the eye of some bored techie at eBay stumbling upon it while browsing reddit at work. Because that is at least as productive a strategy as calling their customer service :(

Ebay,Refund dilemma,"Hi all,

I recently sold an item on eBay and received payment promptly via PayPal (still on hold). Now the buyer has opened a return request, despite having a no return policy and stating such again in the body of the auction text.

Now, the return request reason is listed as ""Changed my mind."" eBay does give me the option to decline the request. However, they also claim that they've ""already shipped the item back."" I didn't ask or provide info for that and didn't get a tracking number, so I suspect it's a scam.

My question is, can I still decline immediately? The reason clearly shows ""changed my mind,"" not that they weren't as described or anything like that. Or should I try and fish a tracking number out of the buyer for documentations' sake? I don't want to preemptively decline the request only to have it escalate. 

Thanks for the help.

EDIT: while writing this post I received another ebay notification saying that the return was closed by the buyer: it was accidentally started and they wanted something else unrelated to me returned.

Ebay,Suspended for outside transactions and eBay reps who lie,"So eBay has cost of themselves two sales in from my account. I'm  a long time seller and have done many transactions including  A few each year that are local. These local transactions are all done through eBay but not through PayPal. In April eBay flagged a local buyer Who wanted to buy a heavy item without shipping and cut off our communication. We had exchanged no contact information of any kind and we're just negotiating the place for the transaction.   They did issue me a warning and I thought it was just a mistake so I ignored it. Come this month another buyer wants to go local and I get flagged again with  A seven day suspension. The reason given was exchanging contact information which we had not.  So I get on the phone with eBay and explain the situation and they politely tell me that I was flagged for exchanging contact information.   The rep then proceeds to tell me that there's absolutely no way of eBay overturning this suspension. I  asked the representative to show me where I exchanged contact information and she could not do it because I didn't. She still steadfastly refused to fix the issue. I then proceeded to escalate through three different reps, two of them  repeating the same lie that eBay never fixes an account with this type of suspension. Finally  I get a hold of the rep who fixes the problem. Is this a new thing that I can't sell local anymore even if I pay eBay fees? Even if this is not the new way, I really can't risk having my account suspended and spending two hours on the phone trying to get it corrected over one transaction.

Ebay,Banned forever! My account was suspended and eBay refuses to help or even tell me why.,"First, let me give some key information about my eBay account. I'm not a seller. I've never bid on any auctions. I have exclusively used eBay to shop using the ""Buy it now"" option. I've had no issues, the sellers received my payments, they shipped the items. I've submitted no complaints and none have been made against me. I think I'm an ideal responsible buyer!

All my information on the account is accurate. It's a fairly new account because I now live in Indonesia and had to make a new Paypal account (Paypal Indonesia) in order to have items shipped to me here. I initially had an issue with Paypal because they wouldn't let me use an American debit card, but that's since been resolved now that I have a local bank account. My previous eBay account was in the US, also with no previous issues.

So a couple weeks ago, I purchased 5 or 6 small items from eBay. Payments went through. All items have shipped and I've received a couple of them already, still waiting for long international shipping on the others.

Then I received an email a couple days ago saying that my account has been suspended, and I am no longer allowed to use eBay and would not be able to create a new account. That's all. No ""click this link to resolve the issue"" or ""call this number.""

I went to the eBay website, looked over reasons for suspensions (none of which apply to me!), and then sent an email. Their response was that the decision was made that I am ""a risk to the eBay community,"" and that they cannot disclose any further information.

Today I received another email notifying me that my old eBay account was suspended as well because it's linked to the new one.

I called customer support, spoke to a few different people (everyone claims to be ""your highest point of contact""), and it's set in stone: I am banned forever and they won't tell me why. They kept saying things like ""certain factors"" and ""reasons we can't disclose,"" etc.

They did finally confirm some things that were NOT the reason for my suspension... They confirmed there were no issues with my payments, they confirmed it's not because I'm in Indonesia, and they confirmed that it's not because I had a previous eBay account and created a second one.

Seriously! What then?! I can confirm my identity or payment methods or anything they want, but they simply said that's not the problem, but they won't tell me what the problem is.

Purchased item #3 (last night) said they had 4 in stock. Wake up to find a refund, and that they're out of stock. They meant to list 1 not 4 (?) and refunded without explanation. Again, I had to reach out to get a reason as opposed to them stating why. For that matter, I purchased while they still had 4 in stock.

Ebay,Ebay wants to change my address with abbreviations.,"I'm moving and so I'm taking the time to update everything on my Ebay account. Our street has a bit of a long name and I think Ebay's autocorrect is fooling itself.

I can't correct it and there's no way to edit it to how I want the address to be. With this format I'm sure any packages will go to the wrong address and it has also taken the ""S"" off of the end of the street name. Will that make a difference to where they deliver?

Ebay,Hello. Need advice on an e-Bay transaction.,"A while back I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/6djm0v/strange_transaction_on_ebay/)


The buyer has since gotten back who now says he was trying to troubleshoot and removed the CPU and found bent pins (on the motherboard socket). 

He is asking if I can work something out for a refund on the board. 

I sold 4 items together. The motherboard, the CPU, the CPU cooler and RAM. 

That was the only CPU in the board since I got it. The motherboard was removed working with the CPU, cooler, and RAM intact then tested prior to shipping. So the only possibilities are, it came that way from the factory, or was caused by him taking out the CPU.   

Not sure how to respond. I do not want to refund ANYTHING because it all worked prior to shipping. Some of my friends say that I should tell him straight up NO and accuse him of damaging it. 

What do?


Good news: 

The buyer contacted me after I explained it left here working and it arrived there (by his account) not working. So I suggested he contact UPS.

I got a response less than 4 hours later saying everything working fine now. LOOLOLolol",9,4,2017-06-07,EBAY,0.06369457393884659,0.8899813294410706,0.04632413759827614

Ebay,Pros and Cons of Keeping Separate Buying and Selling Accounts,"I know this type of question has been previously asked on multiple occasions, but I was looking to frame it a bit differently here. Since I do nearly all of my sourcing from Ebay, my situation is somewhat unique.

From what I can gather, the following are the pros and cons of sticking with a single account:

&amp;nbsp;

Pros

Boosted feedback score from sourcing purchases (I know this has no impact on my seller feedback score, but the overall feedback score is still important to buyers)

No need to constantly switch accounts

Simplicity

&amp;nbsp;

Cons

Users have the ability to learn of and follow my reselling history

Increased liklihood ""Best Offers"" will not be accepted if and when sellers take note of my username

Increased liklihood of a seller canceling a transaction to relist their item for a higher price for the same reason listed above

Vindictive sellers may decide to purchase from me and left negative feedback in retaliation


&amp;nbsp;

Essentially what I'm asking is, how should I weigh the benefit of a higher feedback score versus the the possible sourcing impact from others knowing I am a business? Considering that I only have roughly 600 feedback as of this moment, my priority up to this point has been on the former, but I have begun to rethink said position.",3,3,2017-06-08,EBAY,0.045898690819740295,0.912115752696991,0.041985560208559036
Ebay,Potential Issues with Handling Time Gone?,"Now that seller handling time seems to have been removed from the shipping details on most listings, I am worried that there may be more negs from buyers who do not receive their items by the estimated delivery date.

At least before, when an item was late, the buyer could determine if the seller had met their shipping timeframe obligations. They could then clearly discern that the delay was caused by the shipping carrier, not the seller. Without the stated handling time, the buyer has no way of knowing why their package is late, and could more easily blame the seller.

Is anyone noticing an issue now that handling time has been removed?

Ebay,A Fun Customs Charges Complaint...,"I sold a fifty dollar item to a customer in a country not really known for its import taxes, but she was charged a fair amount when the item arrived in her country. She sent me a message telling me about the amount of the customs charges and how I should have informed her about them. Of course she doesn't want the item anymore, and plans on having the shipment returned to me. I agreed to refund her when the package arrives back to me, but also sent a message ""lecturing"" her about how sellers can't possibly know whether or not a shipment will be charged let alone how much, and how refusing delivery causes trouble for sellers, and that she should review eBay's policies. She responded telling me I was rude to be putting the blame on the buyer, and that I should have informed her about the customs charges (which she referred to as ""shipping"" charges) and how she has never had a problem on eBay. She also demanded a refund.

I thought I was polite enough. Would I be wasting my time trying to set this buyer straight by directing her to eBay's actual policies, or should I just leave it at blocking and reporting her (which I have done)? I'm at a loss here.

Ebay,"Wait, Did I lose $30 here?","Top Edit:

Since a lot of you think

""Oh He waited 40 days and then he opened a case""

The first call I did was to my local post (The food market) the date of 2017-04-04 (Waited the weekend to make sure that I might get the letter that I can pickup a package on monday).

The second call I did (When the people at the first place said they couldn't find anything) was to the main post headquarters in my country asking for it, same answer here. There is no package for me with this tracking code &amp;  my name / adress

I waited a few days and checked the tracking again and saw that they send ""sent me a reminder"" (Which I never got which makes me believe that the seller did not send this package to MY adress &amp; name since I never got the reminder and that's why the post can't help me locate it when I call them).

I waited til the week after to see if the reminder would arrive in my mailbox, It didn't.

I made the same 2 calls as above once again at the date 2017-04-10 and there was still no package for me with this tracking code and my name / adress.

At the 13th the package was returned due to me ""NOT PICKING IT UP"" (Because I couldn't since there was no package for me).

I then opened a case since there was nothing more I could do this in this situation, and if there was, Please tell me what I could actually have done here?


-----------------

So I bought a product on Ebay from China with 30 days shipping.

I waited 40 days and then opened a case against the seller as ""I have not recieved the item""

Before opening I had called the post office checking if I have gotten any package from China with My name and the tracking code I was given from the Ebay seller.

I had not.

In this case the first thing the seller says is

&gt;In the tracking it says that you failed to pick up the item so it is now being returned to us

I then said, 

&gt; Oh, well if it's being returned, Could I have a refund?

The seller then said 

&gt; We tried to give you a refund but we get Ebay error, If you close the case we send you money on PayPal.

I asked them multiple times to just refund because I am not closing the case and they send money to me on PayPal.

After ~10 days of the case I asked Ebay to step in help.

They then put the case on HOLD and after 3 days they closed the case in the sellers favour saying

&gt;""In the shipping it said that you could have picked up the item but you didn't, 

&gt;Next time we recommend you to check the tracking more often

&gt;Case closed.""

This is just outrageous, So the item is being returned to the seller (IT EVEN SAYS THIS ON THE TRACKING SITE!!) so Ebay wont help me get my money back? 

What the hell? The seller gets both the item and the money now? 

-------

Edit: 

For those who downvote, put yourself in my chair.

* You pay a amount of money for a product (My case was 30 USD)
* You wait over 1 month to get the item
* You check the tracking and the item is supposed to be at your post office for you to pickup and it says that they have given you notifications about it but you haven't gotten anything so you can't pick the package up
* You call both your post office and the 'headquarters' of the post in your country
* They can't help you because they can't find the package you are searching for
* The tracking is updated a few days later saying that the product you purchased is being returned
* You contact the seller &amp; ebay for a refund because you was unable to get the package (Since you didn't get any notification) (In my country before you can pickup a package you need to get a special code usually sent in a SMS or delivered in your mailbox)
* Ebay closes your case and says 'Well you should have looked at the tracking' (When you clearly have and you even tried to get your hands on the package you have been waiting for)

So you tell me that you would just accept that you just lost X amount of money and you couldn't have done anything in this situation. 

Now the seller both keeps the ITEM and the Money because you have no idea if the package was even sent to your adress &amp; phone because the tracking just says ""Sent to country""",36,11,2017-06-10,EBAY,0.0677831768989563,0.9029807448387146,0.029236124828457832

Ebay,Should I Ask For A Refund Or A Replacement?,"Basically I bought the Rocky Heavyweight Collection Blu Ray off of eBay a week or two weeks ago I believe. It was shipped out fast and overall decent delivery speed considering it was coming from the UK to Ireland, but that's where my positives of the Blu Ray ends. The box to me is quite damaged. This is basically a slip cover large box that holds the blu rays. I know of the risks with posting, but this one seems a little too much to me. I can deal with the odd small tear if that's it, but this seems to be a lot more. Anyway I just decided to try and suck it up, but it seems to be bugging me more. I don't like it for my collection to be honest. It just looks broken. I thought I would upload the images of the item to see what you guys think. If it would be worth it to ask for a replacement or a refund. The seller is a store so I guess that's a plus. The seller has this listed under returns ""
If you are unhappy with your purchase, you can return it to us in its original condition within 14 days of the date you received it, unopened (with all seals and shrink wrap intact) and we will issue a refund for the item price you paid. We reserve the right to refuse returns or to charge you our fees and expenses if the product is received otherwise than in accordance with this requirement""

Clearly not the case since it's been opened etc. I'll link the images via Imgur. The photos look a little crappy I guess since the phone isn't the best. Bought it from China for cheap a while ago. Never really wanted a phone all that much.

Ebay,ebay/paypal seller protection,"I am selling some stuff on ebay, and I recently just sold 2 items to someone from the russian federation with zero feedback and a momth old account.

For instance, what if he got the items, and then claimed he didn't receive them, and then does a charge back?  Am I just **bleep**, because he physically had possession of the items?  Even if I required a signature, what good would that do?

Or what if he says the product doesn't work and send me back a box full of paper?

Ebay,"Seller Takes Fraud to New Heights (or is it ""Lows""?)","On May 11, I purchased a purportedly new (April 17, 2017 purchase date, according to Apple's serial number checker) Apple MacBook Pro (Mid-2015 2.8GHz/16GB/1TB/AMD M370X) from an eBay seller via Buy It Now. After paying, the seller notified me that the item would have a non-matching bottom case, but that the hardware was otherwise as described in the auction, including the hardware serial number. It raised my suspicions, but I was in desperate need of a laptop, so I told him to proceed, as I felt I'd be covered by eBay's policies if it turned out to be sketchy.

The item was shipped with a Priority Mail label to me in Durham, NC, but traveled, according to the tracking, via First Class Mail to KEARNY, NJ 07032, before being routed to Durham, NC and delivered on May 19, 2017 without signature confirmation (despite him charging me an additional fee for that). Curiously, the delivery scan shows delivered to Durham, NC and ""WEST NEW YORK, NJ 07093"" at the same time (this is important).

The box was crushed, so I filmed opening the package, in order to document possible damage. The laptop did end up being damaged in transit (because it was wrapped in a single layer of half-deflated bubble wrap) and I immediately filed a return request. The seller, at first, asked for further documentation, then alleged fakery (Photoshop and CGI filmmaking), refusing to issue the return (after I exhausted the 10 image limit in the initial return claim message, I uploaded the original images and video, with intact geolocation metadata, straight to Dropbox from my iPhone and included the folder in the claim). Eventually, eBay stepped in and decided the case in my favor. After the case was closed, the seller sent eBay a label and eventually emailed me the same *Photoshop* PDF file containing a USPS Priority Mail label for the return. 

After dropping the parcel off (packed much better, with security tape and fully documented -- I've been on eBay since 1999), I looked at the USPS receipt for the return parcel at a stoplight and noticed that the destination field (Providence, RI) did not match the label destination on the label (La Jolla, CA). Quickly returning to my office, I opened the PDF in Photoshop and found it had multiple layers, stacking addresses upon the label, the bottom-most being addressed to someone *with the same last name as the PayPal payee,* in Providence, RI. I was able to call the Post Office and halt processing of the parcel, pending an intercept request. The tracking number indicates that the label, sent to me on June 1, was most recently used to mail a parcel to IMMOKALEE, FL 34142 on May 13 (traveling through Providence, RI). The PayPal label record shows that the label was originally used to ship a 'head and neck massager' to a eBay user whose account no longer exists for an item number that does not return a result (i.e., it's very, very old).

I have provided this information to eBay (the high value claims rep was flabbergasted when he opened the label they received and saw the edits), IC3.gov and the USPS, both in-person and via the USPS Postal Inspector's website. I have the original packing materials, including the ""USPS"" label used to ship the laptop to me and the original emails sent to me from the seller and the altered USPS PDF. eBay is giving the seller until 11:59pm PDT on June 15, 2017 to issue a refund; I don't want to tip him off.

I believe that the seller is counterfeiting USPS Priority Mail labels, using old tracking information (the electronic USPS system routes the parcel to the original label's destination, where it is overridden and re-routed to the addressee). (I also suspect that he re-encoded the serial number of the laptop motherboard, but I have not visually examined the board to confirm/refute this hypothesis.)

--
**Question:** I'd like to report this to PayPal, but I'm not sure how to do so, without tipping off the seller to the fact that he (hopefully) is now being investigated for counterfeiting postage (which carries up to 5 years in prison per offense).  Any suggestions (since the 'dispute' system looks like it sends a message to the payee)?

--
**tl;dr**: an eBay seller woefully under-packed an expensive laptop, fought the return of the damaged item and then sent a counterfeit USPS return label when eBay began to force a refund and I'd like to report him to PayPal. (eBay already knows, but I still don't have a refund, yet).

Why would the buyer be asked to pay an additional 10 dollars for a **flat rate** box, especially when I already paid 12 dollars to buy and print the shipping label in the first place? We agreed that he would go to the post office tomorrow and ask what the charges were for, and confirm that they weren't mistaking a flat-rate box for a normal box. 

If USPS still claims that he owes money after his visit, what should I do? I don't sell on Ebay a lot and any help with how to continue with this issue would be appreciated.

EDIT: I wanted to edit this in case someone stumbled upon it in the future. I actually shipped out three of these dual flat rate boxes. To be honest, I am unsure how many of them I folded ""express"" and how many I folded ""normal"", but if I remember correctly I folded all of them the same way (express). Only ONE of the three buyers was charged extra for shipping. I assume that one of the post offices went by the outside of the box, and two of the post offices went by the shipping label that I printed out.",7,13,2017-06-14,EBAY,0.04951617494225502,0.9179337024688721,0.032550062984228134
Ebay,Question From a New Seller About Building Feedback and Buy It Now Offers,"So I'm a new seller to the eBay universe, and I need a second opinion on how to go about accepting which best offers. I haven't sold anything just yet, so I don't have any feedback behind my name, but lately I've been getting some offers on a handful of my things I have posted. Just as an example, a dress I have up for $10+shipping got an offer for $6+shipping. I wanted to accept it to possibly build up some feedback, but when I asked my mom, who's been casually selling things on eBay for years, about it, she said that it's a low ball offer and the buyer is just trying to take advantage of me since I'm a new seller. 
Which brings me to my question: as a brand new seller, should I accept relatively low offers in order to build up feedback? Or should I try and get the highest price I can for my items instead? I understand that some people won't leave feedback regardless, but is it worth losing out on a few extra bucks? 
TL;DR: New seller, is it better to sell things for a higher chance to gain feedback now or to sell high with a lesser chance to gain feedback later?",3,3,2017-06-14,EBAY,0.029853107407689095,0.9266844391822815,0.04346245154738426

I called eBay because the buyer refused to give me the tracking number. eBay told me the buyer would have to go to UPS and they would open an investigation. I tell the buyer this and he claimed ""UPS wouldn't do anything."" That's when I REALLY thought he was lying. There is no way UPS wouldn't be a bit concerned about a stolen item.

Ebay,Item Marked as Delivered But Wasn't. Now What.,"Hi!

So I ordered a moderately expensive item from a seller on eBay.

I live in a large apartment complex with locked package boxes. When you get a package, a key is placed in your small mailbox to open the large mailbox containing a package.

The issue is the key in my mailbox opened up a package box with someone else's package in it. My package was not in the mailbox.

I called USPS and they're sending the driver back out today and let me know that a sub driver was in yesterday (the day of the marked delivery). 

USPS said that the likely scenario is that the sub driver mixed up the keys for the package mailboxes and gave someone else the key for my package. 

I put a note on the package door asking anyone with the package for my apartment to contact me and left my number. However, this morning I checked again and ALL of the package boxes are open and empty. 

I'm assuming either my package is somewhere else on the complex or someone took the package that was delivered into their mailbox.

The seller has been helpful throughout the entire process and I understand that this isn't their fault in the slightest. But what recourse do I have? USPS clearly made a mistake, admitted it to me on the phone, and the package is still marked as delivered even though I never received it in my box. 

Assuming the package is MIA after today. What recourse can I take to protect myself from getting screwed as a buyer for an item that USPS mishandled.

Postman came by for the day to go through the all the apartment boxes. They found it in a box that a key wasn't left for. Problem solved. Crisis Averted.",19,3,2017-06-15,EBAY,0.13681140542030334,0.8383417725563049,0.02484678477048874

Ebay,Blocking interested buyers who make your gut twitch. And why you should check feedback.,"I was selling some parts for lawnmowers.


It can't go USPS because hasmat, so it must ship ground via UPS/Fedex. I happen to have the lowest price online, and I'm also the only person selling it on eBay currently. I'm not terribly worried to move it, because I've already got my money back from the mower and then some.


However, this guy offers me 45% the price I had it listed for, I declined and responded that I can't do that, because his offer barely covers shipping cost. Then he sends me the beaut:


""You turned down my Make-An-Offer price of **-removed-** stating the shipping cost is most of the cost from Ohio to neighboring state Michigan. I'm gonna guess the weight is 1.5lbs.

I received an email yesterday informing that you lowered the Buy-It-Now Price of this **-removed-** by $5.

Shipping this item at 2lbs cost $7.60 and at 3lbs it cost $8.70. I've provided the cost in photos below.

Next I've displayed photo's of my OLD **-removed-** I'm giving it to my oldest son for Father's Day because I received a John Deere for Father's Day.

If you will accept **-removed-** please reply back ASAP and I will buy it today!!!

If not, I will give my son my old Honda Lawn Mower as is.... Because it runs very very well!

**-removed-**"" ( http://imgur.com/DLPmauA )


Now a response like that instantly sends someone to my block list. Not because I want to be a dick, but because it lacks the understanding that shipping costs money, as does my time and the item itself. He also doesn't understand I can't ship it the cheapest way for safety reasons. Plus when people get specific as to how much I should charge, I already get those heeby jeebies that they will find the SMALLEST issue and bend me over. Just my experiences.


So when I got in front of a computer, and finally added them to my block list I checked their feedback. Man. Oh. Man. They don't purchase often (2 items in the past month, 10 in the past 6) but when they do purchase, 2/5ths of them are left as negs unless the seller ""Goes above and beyond"" 3 of them are of them as a seller.

- Before I have been able to argue my case to eBay, they have replied to me by saying ""case closed"", without giving me a chance to express my concerns.

- I have been scammed out of approx. $270 at this point

Ebay,Major flaw in eBays Top Rated Seller / Transaction Defect Rating system,"Just a little rant here to warn sellers like me, medium volume antiques / collectibles seller who goes out of there way and above and beyond for their customers with over 4000+ transactions the past 4 years with ZERO negative feedbacks on the account.

 I want to warn everyone who is already pissed about the TRS FVF discount being cut in half plus the stricter requirements to meet the TRS status - customer service reps have made it clear to me today I will be losing my TRS status because of a flaw in their system where they can not remove defects on your account in the exact category of ""tracking uploaded on time and validated by carrier"". The back story to this is that I had a customer who bought 5 of my items at the same time &amp; paid for them, but then requested to have me ship the items 5 days later so that she would receive them when see returns home from vacation. Not thinking anything of it, I granted the customer that wish with thoughts that I could just call up customer service to have the defects removed. The defects were removed from the ""late shipment rate"" without a problem given the details but because the TDR category of ""tracking uploaded on time and validated"" is essentially operated by a computer only, they can not remove those transactions from your defect rating. 

TL:DR - stop trying to become a TRS because its almost impossible to reach at this point and the trouble / difficulty is not worth the reward anymore. Take your business back to auctions, flea markets, etsy, amazon, etc!

Ebay,how do you handle INAD / Damage claims that send you obviously wrong or fake pics?,"I've had a few of these come up lately.  I am sent pictures that are just bad on purpose - super close up, light glaring over a large chunk of the item, resized to be so small that it's pixelated, etc etc.  One buyer's pictures of a ""damaged shipping box"" were overly dark and purposefully made bad, so I opened them in photoshop and messed with levels - it turns out the box says UPS on the side when I know I used an eBay branded box (bought with their promo) and also shipped it USPS.

The items have been low value, so instead of wasting time dealing with them I have just refunded, blocked, and moved on.   But after I did this just one time, 3 more cases have come up in the 2 months since.   

The shipping box one is the one that gnaws at me and the reason I'm posting.  Also, I don't think it's a coincidence that these cases are all coming up from users who also sell in the same category I do (it's a huge category with plenty of room for everybody).  

I know how eBay treats these cases - or rather, how they don't even bother to look at the seller's case / evidence.  I have also fought one of these cases before where the buyer sent me pictures of a different item then I sold them - and they even resent the same  pictures after I replied saying that's not the item you bought from me.  I lost that case, even after talking to a US customer support agent before the case ended to try and escalate it in my favor - they were sympathetic and understood my side, but still would not do anything for me.

Any help / ideas / strategies would be greatly appreciated!  And I understand the cost of doing business, and will most likely still just refund / block / move one with low cost items as they are not worth the time it takes to deal with them.  Thank you!

He had no pictures of the caseback or the bracelet. It is scratched to hell. He also said watch came with box and papers which means in the watch world the warranty card which adds substantial value. The warranty card was not in the box. Fast forward he sends me a condescending message back asking why I waited so long to return it, the scratches could be buffed out, and the warranty card didn't matter. He then accepts return and I go to bed. I just woke up to another message saying it was by accident and he is escalating it. Repeats over and over for me not to send the item. Which I'm not because I want this to be official. What should I do?

Ebay,Need some advice; item hasn't arrived,"Hello,

I need some advice. I bought an item where ETA said it would arrive within 2/3 working days. It hasn't arrive so I raised a ticket the day after the ETA stating that the item hasn't arrived. I get in contact with the seller who tells me that it was delivered. A week has gone by and I still didn't get anything. Not even a note from the postman of whether the package has been delivered. 

I asked neighbours whether they received a post but they say they didn't get anything. It's almost two week now. I get in contact with the seller to ask where the item is but they wouldn't tell me. I calmly ask for a refund, to which they get a little aggressive saying that they have delivered it, that I have no proof whether I received the item or not. I think that they think I'm trying to scam them; I've used the site many times, and I have yet to get a negative feedback. I understand that eBay is quite strict against sellers, but I honestly haven't received anything and I got nothing to prove that I haven't got the package.

The seller tells me that they would contact the postage company on the monday and would charge me for fraudulant claims. I told the seller that I'll wait till Sunday to see if I get anything, but it has already been 2 weeks. What do I do? I haven't got the item, I've paid through PayPal. Would I receive the money back? Should I be worried about the ""fraudulant claim"" matter? 

Edit:
I should also add that I got an automatic response from ebay from when I submitted the ticket that I should contact them if the issue is not resolved by the 18th. Should I wait till Sunday to see if the item come in then or wait till Monday?",6,3,2017-06-17,EBAY,0.11347532272338867,0.8595951795578003,0.02692951261997223
Ebay,[UK] Just realised an item is fake after a year,"A year ago exactly, I purchased Pokémon Platinum from a seller on eBay. Recently, after realising that I hadn't played it, I decided I'd go on to resell on eBay. As I was packing it up for dispatch, I noticed that the label on the game was sort of blurry, and the instruction manual seemed off, such as page numbers jumping about depending on the page.

I've come to the conclusion that the seller supplied me with a counterfeit game.

I've contacted my buyer to let them know everything I just told you here, but what are my options now? Can I get a refund from the original seller? What do I do?

When I got the credit card bill it was clear that the seller is in CA...called paypal to confirm.

Paypal admitted that the person is a small time seller in CA and has no physical presence in my state and could find no sales tax cert. for my state, just for CA.

Ebay,Guitar shipped to wrong address - am I screwed.,"I sold a guitar on eBay, for $3120. I'm located in NY, and the buyer is located in FL. 

I ship the guitar out via fedex, required indirect signature, and payed for declared value insurance for the full amount of the guitar ($3120). The shipping address the guitar was sent to was an address in Florida.

I ship the guitar out on 6/13/17. On the 14th, I checked the tracking info and it said a future delivery was requested. I thought nothing of it, and a few days later I checked and saw that the delivery status hasn't updated, so I contacted the buyer last night and asked if he was the one who requested a delivery change. He said he didn't request anything. 

Today I check the tracking info, and apparently this package that was supposed to be delivered to FL, was delivered to Middletown, NJ, and was signed for by someone with a different name then the buyer. 

Lets assume they can't locate this package, how screwed am I? 

Like I said the package was insured for the full amount of $3120 via the declared value insurance option that fedex offers when printing a label from eBay.

If it turns out this package was lost, what happens? I obviously have to refund the buyer, but what happens to me? Do I get reimbursed for the full amount since the package had the insurance on it?

I'm absolutely furious right now - I've shipped probably close to 20 guitars via fedex, and have bought 10+ guitars and have had them delivered to me via fedex, and i've never had a problem. I can't believe that out of all the guitars I've sold, the one that they screw up the delivery is a $3100 59' les paul reissue. /sigh",12,16,2017-06-19,EBAY,0.06175893545150757,0.9066202640533447,0.03162087872624397

Ebay,Increasing monthly limit,"Hello everyone,

I am new (this time around) to eBay and I have a 5 item or $500 limit a month which I feel hinders my ability to sell as I feel the more items I post the better chance I have to sell something. I've only sold one thing for under $40 in a month :(

Anyway, I called to increase my limits and was asked to verify incredibly strange information such as my distant relatives age, where certain relatives own property, part of my SS, color of my car... all of which really scared me that they would have that information. I even wondered if I was actually on the phone with eBay... I've never been asked such specific and bizarre questions even when opening a bank account or applying for a passport or entering and leaving different countries so I was baffled when eBay of all things had this information about me...

Has anyone gone through this with eBay and do you think it's worth it to verify this information with them? I want to make some extra money and I guess $500 a month wouldn't be bad BUT making that when I can only post 5 items (4 now since I sold one) is really really hard cuz I can't find my niche. 

OR has anyone been successful with a 5 item limit?

I asked eBay if this limit would ever Increase on its own and one person said never and one said to call back in a week and see... which wasn't a straight answer. So I'm really confused :(

I'm sorry for the long post or if this is annoying/been asked a million times. It's just I've seen posts of people who start flipping and within a month or two they've made over a thousand and idk how or if they just don't have any limits to begin with? I can't seem to figure it out.

Ebay,Guitar with insurance,"Recently sold a guitar for $1955. Buyer was the only one that didn't ask for additional pictures, lots of bidders. Shipped it carefully using UPS special guitar service we loosened strings, had original case, had UPS pack it. Have a million pictures of this thing. 

Buyer says not as described, that it's damaged and he wants a refund. Either it was really damaged or buyer is full of it, or didn't carefully look at pictures / description. Guitar was independently appraised before auction 

 I asked for pictures for insurance if that is the case. Radio silence. Now what?

I have to look up how much time I have to file a claim with UPS. He chose to have it shipped to a UPS store so he could open it in front of them. I didn't hear anything from him until I asked for feedback. 

Do I contact eBay premptively? I really try to be super careful, but I think that we didn't opt for lots of pictures and we should have and he didn't request the extra which I said in the description I had. I think also his expectation for a 30 + year old guitar is not even close.

Ebay,Update: eBay seller provides counterfeit postage for return of damaged item,"A few people have written to ask for updates on my recent INAD case… (the TL;DR: [an eBay seller woefully under-packed an expensive laptop, fought the return of the damaged item and then sent a counterfeit USPS return label when eBay began to force a refund](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/6h2cfs/seller_takes_fraud_to_new_heights_or_is_it_lows/).)

* After eBay's High Value Claims department determined that the item had been ""delivered"" in May, because the seller had provided, on June 2, a return label with a reused tracking barcode, they gave him 3 days (by 11:59:59 PM PDT on Jun 15) to issue the refund; he did not.

* After those three days passed, I called eBay at 8am the following morning and went through the usual phone tree hell: Tier 1 (I immediately asked for High Value Claims, but he insisted on reviewing the case and expressed skepticism of what I told him) --&gt; Escalation department (was told I should have asked for High Value Claims) --&gt; on hold for 14 minutes --&gt; someone in High Value Claims. Now, all of my previous experiences with High Value Claims reps were thorough, smooth and professional; this one wasn't. The rep expressed disbelief, first responding as though I was the Seller and sympathetic that the ""Buyer"" hadn't returned the item to ""me""… I pointed out that *I was the Buyer* and that the Seller had failed to act according to eBay's terms/MBG and then supplied forged postage to me… he eventually agreed, said he was closing the case and that the refund process would begin. The call ended with less definitive language than I would have liked, but he assured me it was done.

* Five minutes later, I received an email from eBay saying that they ""understood"" how frustrated I was that I *hadn't yet received my item* from the seller and that my case was being *put on hold for 3 more days* to give *us* time to work something out. I picked up the phone again… Tier 1 (asked for HVC, was told she was noting it in my file to go straight to HVC) --&gt; Escalation --&gt; (again, asked for HVC, again was told she was noting it in my file to go straight to HVC) --&gt; 3 mins on hold --&gt; someone I'd spoken to, previously in HVC answered, I asked him the status of my case; he said closed (he'd previously told me on June 3rd, it was closed, which I pointed out) and I read him the email I'd just received. ""Aw, hell, [other guy] sent the wrong email… I'm sorry. You case is definitely closed. You're absolutely getting your money back."" As of yesterday morning, the case still said it was open in My eBay.

* About 6pm EDT, yesterday, exactly one month since I opened the INAD Return Case, eBay sent an email stating that ""Customer Support made a final decision."" This was the second message email about this case with that subject line (the first one came in on June 7). This time around, it included information about the refund, which came as an eBay credit to my PayPal, rather than a reversal of the previous transaction.

* Curiously, the Buy It Now purchase in My eBay's purchase history now shows under ""Canceled Items,"" rather than previous purchases, though my feedback for the seller remains intact.

---

On the legal side of things, I filed complaints about the fraudulent postage with:

* my local Post Office (in order to get the parcel back, as an intercept could not be performed with a previously used tracking code). I provided them copies of all the paperwork, my contact info and documentation of the parcel;

* FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center - http://ic3.gov -- I filed a Postage Fraud complaint, listing all the parties involved, including my credit card issuing bank, PayPal, the seller's info, the return recipient's info (they didn't match), the transaction numbers and the postal labels. I've not yet heard from them.

* U.S. Postal Inspection Service - https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov / 1-877-876-2455 (file online, first -- they won't take reports over the phone) -- I have received an email from the USPIS saying that they are reviewing the case and they have asked me to hold onto all the relevant paperwork, emails and packaging from the seller.

I did look up the return address of the original package / return label destination -- it's a condo, but the San Diego County Assessor/Recorder/Clerk’s office uses a private data broker that charges for records requests for the individual units, so I can't confirm that one of the two names I have is actually the owner of the condo (which most-recently sold on 11/29/2016). (And honestly, I'm tired of thinking about this jerk.)

Ebay,Advice required - am I being conned?,"EDIT: THANKS FOR ALL THE ADVICE EVERYONE, I APPRECIATE IT. THE GUY FINALLY ADMITTED IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH HIS SETUP, NOT THE MODEL I SOLD HIM. BASICALLY HE DIDN'T RESEARCH WHAT HE WAS BUYING AND IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE TRACK HE WAS USING. SO HE WAS DEFINITELY TRYING TO PLAY ME, BUT EBAY SHOT HIM DOWN. THANK YOU EBAY CUSTOMER SERVICES!!


Hello, apologies if this turns into a wall of text, but I'm seeking advice from the community.

I am a UK based seller, and sold a model train via ebay to a gentleman in New Zealand.

I tested it before I sent it and it was working absolutely fine.

I shipped it out to him via Royal Mail International Track and Signed, and he received it earlier today.

I have since received a returns claim from him, stating that the model doesn't work - apparently one of the sets of wheels is catching on the body of the train and it's causing it not to run.

It was a new item, only opened for testing purposes, and was shipped packaged in it's original box, which is lined with at least 2 inches of polystyrene padding all around it. I also wrapped the box in bubble wrap and parcel paper before I sent it out.

I have two more of these trains here and have checked each of those and neither have the problem he is reporting, nor does there appear to be any obvious way for the fault he is reporting to even happen - there's at least 2-3mm clearance between the moving parts in all places.

I could understand if it maybe got damaged in transit, but it would have to have been a serious blow to bend a solid chunk of metal that the body of the train is made from, and he did not mention anything about damaged packaging.

He sent me a couple of photographs of the area he says is the problem, but I can't see any damage or faults - but then photos can't show everything so perhaps it might be damaged.

However, he's freely admitted to me via email correspondence that he has taken it to a ""repair centre"" and they've disassembled it completely to check for faults.

Apparently he thinks it's a ""Factory Defect"" and that the repair centre want to charge him $40 Aus. to ""mill the frame"" and fix the issue.

However, as he's opened an ebay dispute saying the item is ""significantly not as described"" in the ebay listing, ebay have automatically placed a hold on my paypal account and have said I have 7 days to offer him a refund or they'll take the money and refund him anyway.

On top of that, they are wanting me to pay for the return shipping.

Now, I don't know if there might actually be an issue with the item or what, but the fact that the train has been completely disassembled - by the buyers own admission - immediately tells me before I have it returned to me that I'm not going to get it back in the state I shipped it.

As such, should I even be accepting the return at all?

I've tried to speak to ebay's customer services, but because the buyer purchased the item on ebay.com, even though I listed it on ebay.co.uk, they apparently cannot help me at all, and I'll have to speak to the US ebay customer services to seek advice.

On top of that, I was told that US ebay aren't available via email or live chat, so I'm going to have to call the US and spend a fortune on call charges just to speak to them!

On a scale of 1-10, just how screwed am I?

Ebay,New to eBay and having trouble with an international buyer...,"After doing a deep clean of my place I started selling some of my unused but still nice things on eBay, and just shipped my first round of sales today. Everything was going smoothly until some Russian guy (who had just made his account on this day) bought one of my items using ""buy it now"" and THEN proceeded to message me asking about international shipping. My attempts to communicate that I didn't want to ship internationally failed as he kept copy-pasting the same message asking about shipping, so I simply cancelled the order. 

I've since blocked international buyers from seeing my products to prevent this from happening again, but I feel kinda bad or somehow wrong for it. He was clearly new to eBay and knew nothing about how it works, but I'm pretty new, myself. What would you have done?

Ebay,Please assist me (seller) with a probable scam on 300$ camera.,"So I sell on eBay and very rarely have any returns because I'm very through in testing my items, my descriptions, detailing any imperfections, and I package like a beast, one time an item was damaged in shipping via Usps and a footprint was on the box, I filed an insurance claim and was reimbursed. My only damaged in shipping experience. And I had to submit photographic evidence to the post office as part of the insurance. Luckily the buyer kept the packaging because he saw the footprint, and I had good pictures.

I'm fairly well versed in policy from reading this forum, I know eBay heavily favors buyers but I could really use some help from second guessing myself on the safest way to proceed as I feel like I'm being scammed.

My two concerns are:
Handle this professionally and not damage my seller rep with eBay.
Protect myself if possible from being scammed, if I am.

I sold a 300$ waterproof shockproof camera and the buyer sent me an angry message 24 hours after delivery about selling him a broken camera and a request for a refund/return claiming the camera was broken out of the box, claiming poor packaging. I shipped the camera wrapped in bubble wrap inside its original box, wrapped the original box in bubble wrap and put it inside a bigger box with scrap styrofoam. I wish I had pictures of my wrapping job...... Hindsight, amiright.

He affixed pictures of the camera and it looks like the camera took a direct impact with the ground. Interestingly he took one with the serial number prominently displayed (this is important later)

I told him I would work to resolve this for him and asked him to provide pictures of the packaging to assist with an insurance claim with the Usps and he said he already threw the packaging away and why should he waste his time ""chasing rabbits"" (seriously wtf). So he claims to not have the box the ""camera in box"" was shipped in or the actual original camera box that was inside the shipping box.

This is when my red flags start going of pretty hardcore, so I stop and rethink this. I go back and look at the serial number picture scrutinizing the details. I noticed in comparing my pictures with his that the tiny screws in the case were all at different angles than mine, six of eight total, leading me to believe that he either took mine apart or switched serial numbers.

And now I've come here for advice. How should I proceed, can he screw this up for himself with the screws showing tampering (will eBay even consider this evidence)",26,18,2017-06-21,EBAY,0.0499492809176445,0.9132178425788879,0.036832891404628754

Ebay,Faulty Returns,"Hey Reddit. This question has been asked many times, but I'm hoping someone with personal experience can guide me. I sold a $450 item to a customer on eBay and shipped it out using USPS Priority Mail. I purchased full insurance and signature tracking. Unfortunately, the buyer made a mistake and requested a return. I offered returns on the listing, with a 20% restocking fee and return shipping was to be paid for by the buyer. I specifically mentioned to the buyer that the item must arrive in the same condition in which it was sent, and that they needed to repackage the item safely, as I did initially. But of course, like many others in the past, the buyer failed to package the item safely, which led to the item getting damaged in transit. I haven't contacted the buyer yet, but I'm assuming he/she will not accept liability. I contacted eBay several times and was told that nothing could be done. I contacted USPS and was told that the insurance covers only $50 (Priority Mail Return Service). The return label that the buyer purchased from eBay did not include full insurance. I find that odd, because I send the package with full insurance initially. Anyways, when mentioned to the eBay representative, I was told that, ""that's just the way it is"". So, I just wanted to know, is there any way I can keep my money? The amount of negligence shown by buyers on eBay is sickening.

Ebay,"""Chargeback"" from eBay buyer? Please help!","Good evening r/EBay 

This morning I woke up to an unexpected email from PayPal telling me a buyer that purchased a pair of shorts from me on eBay issued a ""chargeback"" and PayPal was trying to take $94 from my account.

I'll try to make this long story short. This dude bid on a pair of khaki shorts on my eBay account and bid $94. He then said it was a mistake and wanted to cancel the order. I accidentally pressed the ""cannot cancel order"" button. 

The guy wanted to buy the shorts for the price I had for buy it now so he bought them for $30. 

Then a few weeks later I get a payment from this guy for $94 I messaged him and said I don't know why I received this payment and I sent him the money back.

Now this dude is saying this $94 was sent to me as an ""unauthorized payment"". I called PayPal today I told them he bought the shorts from me for $30 and provided the tracking number to show they are delivered. PayPal could also see that this guy randomly sent me $94 and saw that I sent him back the $94 the same day.

On the phone PayPal gave me all this info about a ""chargeback"" and told me not to worry and that they were on my side. I'm still very stressed and worried that somehow this guys credit card company will be able to steal money from me.

So far I provided PayPal with a tracking number and  they have since made my PayPal balance available again and it is not negative.

I'm so stressed I need some input on this..has anyone had an experience like this? I've been selling on eBay since 2014 and this has never happened to me before.

Ebay,Attempt to extort money from me on eBay. Help dealing with this would be much appreciated.,"I've recently sold a laptop to someone that was brand new. They received it, left a positive feedback, everything seemed fine. All of the sudden I get a message saying ""the battery doesn't work"". 

I looked it up and it seems common enough that others have had similar problems with these laptops, so I believed them. I told them they could either return it or I could offer to pay them for the price of the battery. 

Replacement batteries sell for $20, but I offered $40 for their time and the inconvenience. I even linked them to a couple of places where they could buy a new battery. 

Suddenly they message me back, ""new batteries are more expensive than that. I want at least $100"" (more than a third of the cost of the laptop).

I told them: ""Why do you need $100? I linked to you several listings that are genuine OEM batteries that are $20 with free shipping. I think $40 is more than fair because it's double what it will cost to replace the battery."" Then I linked them to more listings and included screenshots.

I just received ""If you are not willing to offer me more than $100, I WILL get eBay involved.""

I don't know how to respond to this. Obviously eBay isn't going to do anything. Do I just stop responding until I get a return request? Do I try and calm them down? I have Top Rated Seller status and would rather not have that at jeopardy because of the negative they may give.

I operate a small business on ebay, selling designer bags that i find at yard sales and consignment shops. I make sure to only purchase bags that are in excellent condition, without any tears, stains, or scuffs. My feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, over 900 with only 2 negative.
Recently, i had sold a bag to a buyer that i was 100% sure was in perfect condition. I had very clear photos, and every part of the bag was photograped.

Ebay approved it anyway, and made the buyer ship the bag back. Now that i have recieved it, i am 100% positive that this is not the bag i had sold them. Ebay refuses to assist me with the situation.

Ebay,"False listing location: Item listed as in UK, but comes from China","Often I buy small electronics from eBay. I usually don't mind waiting a month for them to arrive from China, but if I need anything quickly I will filter the location as Europe so it will usually arrive within a week (I'm in Lithuania). Recently I've seen a lot of items that are listed as being in a European country, but when you read the description it mentions a 20-30 day shipping time and the business is registered in China.

For example:

http://imgur.com/gallery/qIKf0

This item is listed as in the UK, but take a look at the last few lines of the description. Uh ha...

I understand that this is against eBay's [Item location misrepresentation policy](https://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/item-location.html), but it seems like they don't really care. There have been mentions of this before on this subreddit: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/4pcz55/item_location_canada_yet_ships_from_china/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/644cmu/australian_ebayers_beware_false_locations/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/402ntj/location_abuse_import_tax_and_vat_uk/). If you buy an item from China and it finally does arrive you may also be liable to customs fees, which eBay will not refund you even though the listing is against their policies.

If anyone from eBay is reading this (ha!) I just want to say that this really decreases the quality of your product. If an item says it is going to arrive in a few days, but it takes a month to arrive, I'm not going to blame the seller, I'm going to blame your site and shop elsewhere. This not only makes eBay look bad but also the legitimate sellers.

If you see any listings like this please report it to eBay (click Report Item halfway down the page) and hopefully they will take notice and start doing something about it. If anyone knows of a good way to filter out these items please add a comment!",5,2,2017-06-22,EBAY,0.04803071543574333,0.9234077334403992,0.028561580926179886

Ebay,Got scammed through an eBay auction. Is it possible to call eBay and escalate my case early?,"I bought a PS4 Pro off eBay on June 12th.

What was strange was this package was mailed from Vegas and it's supposed to be shipped to Chicago, which usually takes 3-5 business days. Today, I still have not received my package and the seller has never replied back to my messages. I opened a case yesterday on eBay, but it's telling me to wait until next Wednesday to have eBay step in and help, but there's no point as obviously I contacted the seller numerous times already.

I don't have to provide pictures to liar and cheater seller who sell trash to people and rob them the laptop is full of liquid which make no part to be salvage you should be shamed of scamming people and looting people's money by selling junk item seller like you should be banned from eBay to stop been robbed by people like you. You should accept return of your junk item. You mentioned to use as for part but there is no single part that can be used and also expensive part missing.

You sent a message:

Still no pictures of the missing HDD, on one hand you claim to want it for parts. On the other hand you're claiming that you cannot use it. I'm a little confused as offering a refund on the part you're complaining about doesn't seem to be satisfactory to you. Are you wanting the Macbook for parts? As it was advertised? Or are you wanting to claim that you're using it in an effort to not accept my partial refund which essentially solves this whole situation.

You sent a message:

It was listed as not working and sold for parts. You were never going to be able to use it as it is liquid damaged. You received what was described.

You purchased a liquid damaged pc which was advertised for parts only and it was sent with the hdd. I have 100% positive feedback. I maintain that it was sent with the hdd and you have simply made an assertion that the Hdd is missing. I do not accept this. I opened the MacBook before sending it and the hdd was present. However, without admission of any liability and without accepting your assertions, I am prepared to pay a reasonable amount for a hdd as I cannot accept a refund as I need the computer sent back with its hard drive, intact.

I m offering a partial refund to cover the cost of the missing HDD. This way you re covered for the apparent missing part and I don t lose out as I know it was sent with a HDD in it.

You sent a message:

Upon second check of the listing, there is no mention of it including a HDD. Upon inspecting the item there was a HDD in the unit. I couldn't verify the size of the HDD as the computer doesn't turn on. The item was sold for parts and not working, with no returns. This way you get a free HDD worth around $200. Probably would have been a good idea to check the HDD size as it was never stated in the auction. That's a generic post about the usual specs of a MacBook Air

Ebay,Trying to figure out what to do,"Long story, so I will attempt to list the events. Fun fact, I live in Hawaii so I always check shipping and fine print in listings to see if items can be shipped or have higher fees for Hawaii. 

-found the item that said free shipping to United States with no stipulation for Hawaii. 
-paid for item. 
-seller said shipping is 100$, and sent PayPal invoice for 60$(for shipping). 
-I cancelled the invoice, politely (seriously!) inquired about the free shipping to the United States, and that the listing did not mention Hawaii had higher costs. 
-No reply
-I informed them that I did not want to pay for shipping, and asked to just be refunded. 
-No reply
-I waited until I was able to open a case to ask for refund and then did so. 
-I bought the item somewhere else. 
-Sent another email asking for a refund to the seller. 
-FedEx tracking number appeared. 
-Seller refunded my payment. 
-Second item arrived. 
-First item arrived(that I no longer needed)
-Called seller to let them know what happened, and that I would send item back but I wasn't going to pay for shipping it as I didn't need it and I didn't want to pay shipping in the first place. 
-seller asked me just to repay for it (I told them I don't need it.)
-seller said they would send prepaid shipping label. 
-still waiting. 

What do I do??  I don't want the seller to be out the item and the money, but I'm not paying 100$ shipping to fix their mistake. Prior to them shipping it they knew I wasn't going to pay shipping. eBay says to just keep the item but I don't feel that's fair to the seller. I'm at a loss about my options.

I've got an account I've had since 2001 and would like to keep.

I've been away from internet since Nov 2016 and found out today that a couple of weeks after my last use my account was hacked, details changed and many fraud orders placed abroad (I'm UK, AC details and orders all in USA).

Looking through my emails I see eBay noticed fraud activity very quickly and locked the account, fraud orders seem to have been cancelled etc and on logging in today I have changed my password.

Trying to restore my user details led me to a message telling me the account is locked and to call customer service...

Now I'm utterly frustrated. The phone line quality is terrible, the offshore call centre people simply cannot understand me or me them (sounds like a Philippines accent maybe) that I cannot get anywhere and have just given up.

Ebay,I got Ebay to remove unreasonable negative feedback! :),"Hey guys, I thought this might be helpful here to some of you who deal with terrible buyers. Just wanted to ~~vent~~ pay it forward because I've had some help from this sub in the past yr since I started selling on ebay. 


Anyway, so I sold a small skincare item in mid-May and found a negative feedback TODAY (more than 40 days later) about the item not being full size. 


I put in the description the exact fl oz, and had a picture of the actual item showing the sealed top. This buyer didn't have any reason to complain. I called up ebay and told them all this and they  removed the negative feedback! They did push me a little to make sure I provided enough info (which is what saved me) and they also try to get you to talk to the buyer first, but I explained that this buyer never contacted me, only left a negative feedback. 


All in all it took me about 7mins on the phone, which was 
unnecessary but at least it's now resolved. Now I just have to block this buyer...


Going forward this reminds me to never get lazy in my descriptions, take photos from every angle, and be very careful about using other seller's previous listings as templates.

Ebay,Dear eBay: You've had about 20 years to figure out shipping and are still embarrassingly bad.,"Is there any other options?  First, today I listed one of many items I had that is 24 x 24 x 48, and 50lbs.  eBay continuosly tells me that this item exceed dimensional weight for both UPS and FedEx ground, despite being under the stated dimensional weight for BOTH of those companies and both of those companies giving me off-ebay quotes since the girth + length is under the limits.


NOW, I go to ship a much smaller item, that I'm mostly sure I selected USPS First Class since it's &lt;16 ounces.  Yet ebay brings me the the ""Link your UPS account"" page when I click ""print label"".  Now, first I'VE ALREADY DONE THIS ABOUT 5 TIMES.  I've linked it.  eBay shipping does not see it.  Second, I verify that I selected USPS First Class because when I use Paypal shipping it has me use USPS.  THIRD, who the hell thought it would be a good idea, even if UPS is selected, to have no option to change the carrier?


I've bought and sold on ebay for 16 (maybe more) years now.  How in the hell can a billion-dollar grossing company not get these simple tasks?  There 0 reason I should be giving up the shipping discounts ebay advertised because they are unable to do even the most basic tasks of letting me ship the way the companies allow.  


Edit:  And now Paypal has Priority flat-rate chosen as my shipping method, which is fine except when I go to First Class there's no option for my own packaging, and when I select First Class with a prepaid box it expectedly, gives me a ""sorry, that service is not available at this time"" answer.  I swear I'm TRYING to ship and ebay/paypal if I didn't know better I'd sweat ebay and paypal would have to TRY to make it this convoluted.

Ebay,Buyer wants to return now used product because he didn't do his own research. What to do?,"I sold new 6TB HDD in a sealed box and everything was great until this weekend when buyer contacted me after more than a month of purchasing the item with a request to return the product. Reason is it doesn't seems to work with his PS4, because he ""bought it to extend his storage capacity"".

He already made a return request with the reason of ""doesn't fit or work on his ps4"" and wants a full refund. What am I suppose to do now? Is it my fault he didn't check before ordering?

He obviously wants to return opened and used product, possibly even faulty now, since he tried install it himself, meanwhile I sold him new device in a sealed box. And on top of that, he waited more than a month instead to let me know after a week or so.",17,4,2017-06-26,EBAY,0.12629291415214539,0.8335966467857361,0.040110498666763306
Ebay,Fake/not correctly described item,"Before anyone tells me I'm an idiot I'll save you the trouble because I admit it. I stupidly ordered a Macbook battery from China thinking I would get a bargain for $60. It was listed as a genuine item but surprise, surprise it wasn't. Lesson learned. 

The photos made it look legit and even after receiving it, it was still very convincing. It was only until I got to the stage of installing it into the Macbook that I started to question it. The sockets didn't line up exactly like that original did. Upon closer inspection the small screws were of a different colour, the spelling of the German warning message was wrong and part of the English warning message had a very slight difference in font to the original.

Anyway, I informed the seller that I thought it was fake. A few days later they said they asked to send it back and would refund me as soon as they received it. They also gave the alternative of refunding $20 right now. Their lack of denial makes me think they know they're selling a fake. I'm aware of eBay's policy against sending fake items not to mention the complications of such an arrangement (they might claim to have not received it even with tracking).

What would be the next step in the situation?

Thanks

Edit: I escalated as per the advice here and not even 1 minute after sending it out I got a refund without needing to send back the item. Thanks everyone.",9,4,2017-06-26,EBAY,0.044538289308547974,0.888464093208313,0.06699756532907486

Ebay,"I think a seller tried to scam my aunt on a return, can I escalate to eBay even though the item was purchased over 4 months ago?","My aunt purchased a very expensive piece of medical equipment which arrived dead. She didn't realize it was broken until she tried to use it about a month after it arrived. After that she waited about another week to ask for my help, and I told her to contact the seller. What she did, though, was email them directly (I think their email was on a piece of paper that came in the box). After a long back-and-forth between the seller and my aunt, sending pictures and doing troubleshooting to prove it was broken, the seller finally admitted that it was broken. However, they then told her to return it to them, and they would refund her original purchase price. The problem is that the item cost around $600, but the shipping was $300. Now they're expecting her to ship it back to China herself and pay the $300 out of her own pocket (and they will not reimburse her for it). So in the end, she'll end up losing $600 if she actually returns it.


I logged into her account today to try to start the return process on eBay officially, but it doesn't give me the option to do it for that item (likely because it was purchased a long time ago). She didn't leave any feedback though.


So I'm wondering, if I contact eBay and tell them that the seller convinced my aunt to initiate the return outside of eBay, and expected her to pay return shipping on a defective product, will they side with me?",2,3,2017-06-27,EBAY,0.13102810084819794,0.8408583998680115,0.028113488107919693

So if you start seeing a bunch of buyers opening INAD cases for things you clearly had in your item descriptions, you can thank eBay for screwing you over by picking random lines of your description and hiding the rest by default.

Ebay,"What is the likelihood that a reputable seller (score over 2,000 with 96-99%) accidentally -- or even intentionally -- sent me an open box item that was advertised as brand new?","I got the limited edition gold PS 4 I wanted and, as I always do when I get a new electronic device, inspected it. I noticed the bag that contained the blue headphones didn't have tape on it and the power cord appears to be a bit scuffed up.

The console itself is the most disappointing, however. Even though the box itself appeared to be genuinely sealed, the console has some very fine scratches on the back part sandwiched between the gold halves and at least one long, light scratch on the bottom of the system.

Now, I'd like to believe I was not deceived due to the seller's high ratings, so I ask myself if they didn't just inadvertently send me an item a customer returned.

I know I am being nitpicky and may not return it at all over something so superficial but, on the other hand, I like to minimize scratches as much as possible and expect an item advertised as brand new to be such.

I'm debating contacting the seller. In the meantime, I'm curious to see what responses I'll get here.

It could have came directly from Sony like that but the small bag with the blue headphones should have been taped up too.

Sold a new iPhone 7 128GB fully sealed, was once on a network. Buyer comes to me and says that it's activated, we were unaware of the issue and deactivated all the sim cards associated with the phones. They had been fully removed from the AT&amp;T network. Buyer is still messaging me saying that the device will not activate. which doesn't make any sense as the device was sold sealed and we removed it from the network ourselves. After suggesting a bunch of fixes I finally give up and send the return label. I have finally received the device back and the phone is still sealed in the original packaging. Obviously, that is still good because I am able to resell it as still sealed. But I didn't accept returns on this listing, as it's still sealed could this be marked as buyers remorse? There is also trouble with I would not like to upset this buyer as he has purchased 60 other sealed device from me with no issues. Just mostly looking for advice and what you guys would say on the situation.

Thanks!",8,2,2017-06-29,EBAY,0.03634042292833328,0.9030060172080994,0.06065354868769646

Ebay,Buyer doesn't have enough money now,"Sold Item on beset offer last night. I got email this morning saying 

""Hey man I only got 50 dollars in my bank account I thought I had 55 would there be anyway you could do 50?"" 

I responded letting him know we agreed on a price and I won't.

He then started trying to ask multiple questions on the item that were already on the listing.

Obviously this is going to be a hassle, should I just stop responding and wait for an Unpaid item case? or is there something I can do so that I don't ship this out and get scammed?

Ebay,"TRS, Returns, and ""Send the Buyer a Message""","Lately I've experienced a series of unlucky situations that have lead to returns. I've been selling around 6 months now and have dealt with 3 returns in the last two weeks.

However, I've recently become a TRS and am a bit confused as to how these returns will affect that. With the last 2 returns the buyer was non-communicative after I used the ""send the buyer a message"" option on the return screen and I was unsure if this would count as a defect if the buyer didn't respond in the allotted amount of time. Both returns were legit, but I had questions that would affect whether I refunded on the spot, or had them ship it back. I decided to not risk it and gave one a full refund, but I'm having second thoughts on the remaining return case and wanted some input here.

tl;dr:

1) If I message a buyer to clarify a return, but they don't message me back before the return closes, does it count as a defect?

2) At what return percentage do I lose TRS status?",5,2,2017-06-30,EBAY,0.2139909863471985,0.7601154446601868,0.02589360810816288
