Ebay,"What is this scam, I don't get it","User wins my auction, then doesn't pay, doesn't respond for days.

Ebay,I have a question with a item I was returning that the post office apparently lost...,"I ordered an $80 item from ebay, but unfortunately ordered the wrong size. 
The seller informed me I could exchange it so I purchased the return shipping and dropped it off at my post office (after hours unfortunately, in their express drop box). 

I did not receive a receipt, or conformation obviously. It should have been two day shipping so after a week I was a bit worried when the seller did not respond. I checked the tracking and it was never even scanned as received. It simply states a label was made. 

So after borderline twisting my sellers arm (she is not being very helpful) I asked her to check her post office, since i had already visited mine 3 times over this issue. 

She finally told me to fill out an insurance claim, and that was it. 

I told her i still wanted to purchase the item in the proper size and if she would consider discounting to make up for the loss (the insurance is 50 max, and the item plus shipping was $90). Considering its possible i wont get the insurance, but i really need/want the item. 

Again she doesn't respond so i ask her if she had luck at the post office and she still hasnt bothered to go check. She might as well shouldn't because i already called for her (from cali to new jersey). 

I don't know, i get that i'm essentially asking her to trust me that i did indeed send it out and am not trying to steal from her. 
But what would i gain? I already paid for the item, i'm not asking her to send me another one for free. 

Her customer service is just terrible, she won't respond to me until the second or third message of me asking repeatedly if she received it yet or is even bothered to look into whether it could be stuck at her post office. 

Is there anything ebay could do?
Is lacking customer service a good enough reason to give someone a lower star feedback? Does it even sound like she deserves subpar feedback from me?

I'm just really bummed and wondering what else i could do.",6.0,2,2013-10-01,EBAY,0.06409265100955963,0.8883197903633118,0.047587569802999496

Ebay,I'm a seller and I need help!!!,"I sold an iPhone on eBay for a lot more than what it was worth.

I checked the prices on eBay and saw there was no way that I would be able to get the same amount of money for it, so I googled my options. I found that if I were to deny their cancel request then I would probably get a bad review and a case opened. I decided to deny it and send out the item anyway. Not long after a case was opened for an undelivered item, I responded with a tracking number and pointed out that it was being delivered that day. The case was then closed and another case was opened for item not matching description. This time they stated that the item was not holding a charge. Now I know that this is not true, but I don't know how to respond. They clearly are just trying to get their money back as they stated multiple times that they are no longer in need of the item.

Ebay,"Some bid on my item, wants to offer more money for it. I have questions!","This is my first time selling something on Ebay, so I may be confused about how some things work.

I listed an item for a 7 day duration.  The starting price is $160 and someone bid on it. I received a message from this buyer and said that they can't wait the final 3 days of the auction and would pay $215, the Buy It Now price I listed.  I was wondering why he didn't just click Buy It Now, and when I looked at my posting there is no option to click Buy It Now even though under ""pricing,"" for my item, it clearly says that there is a Buy It Now price.  What's the deal?

Now I want to sell to this person but at the $215 price, obviously.  How can I do that? If I cancel my listing, then I incur a fee for the person's original bid.  And then if I relist for a higher price, there is no guarantee that he will buy at the higher price.  And even if he did buy it, I'd still be charged *another* final value fee.

If you did not have the ____ to test it and had not it in years, then you were being nothing less than deceitful when you suggested that you KNEW IT WORKED. How in the world can you know without testing? Second and more importantly, you ask whether tried ""changing the batteries."" The batteries, even if replaceable, would have to be nickel cadmium, because the entire point of the battery pack is that you do not need to buy new batteries all the time. Are YOU going to pay for the new batteries if the old are replaceable? I doubt it. And know you want me to return an item that will force me to take a loss in shipping that will all but cost me the refund you will give me?

WTF. I tried to contact ebay about harassment, threatening to leave negative feedback (which he did, abusively so) and possible extortion. But from what ebay is telling me, it seems like buyers can act in any abusive manner they want to because the policy is on their side and the burden of proof is on mine. The buyer opened a case, asking for a replacement. I told him that that item is the only one I had, and I would give him a full refund plus his shipping costs if he would return it. After my response to this effect, the buyer suddenly just closes the case, does not accept anything I had to say..was not willing to accept any help i wanted to give him...and leaves the awful neg feedback! The item was working, as far as I knew! How do I know, that the buyer was not trying to extort me? Next time, I will be as knowledgeable as I can about the product I am selling, because I sure was punished for my ignorance on this one. I don't think buyers should get away with being this rude, EVEN IF there is a problem. There should be a moderator to report abusive people on ebay.

**TL;DR:** How can I get negative feedback removed from my account if believe a buyer was trying to extort me? They left neg. feedback before I even was able to offer a refund (which, of course, I did offer!) and left neg feedback before even opening their case. I contacted ebay but they did not have any explicit proof of his trying to extort me so they can't remove the feedback.

Ebay,"Been scammed, need some advice.","Hey guys,

A couple weeks ago, I put my iPhone 5 on eBay. It was bought via buy it now about two days later, and the buyer promptly asked me to ship the device. I told him that I'd ship as soon as I got my money, which is the usual thing to do.

This guy knew what he was doing though. He had paid with an e-check. So eBay was telling me that funds would be available three weeks later, and the guy told me that this is normal since he paid with an e-check. So, I shipped the device since eBay let me know that he had paid with an e-check and funds would be available after about three weeks.

Then, the morning right after, I received an email saying that the guys e-check is a bad check, and not to ship the phone. eBay took a day to let me know of this, and by that time, I had already shipped the phone. Big mistake. Unfortunately, I went to the post office to try and stop the delivery, but USPS can't do that. I had signature confirmation on the delivery, so I know the guy received the device. He did it to a bunch of people all at the same time, and I think I may have been the only one to ship it as quickly as I did, since eBay took a day to tell me that the e-check is a bad check, and it was bounced. 

I called eBay. They let me know that they can only refund my final value fee, and do absolutely nothing else. I have no idea what to do, and if I can't make this guy pay, I want to learn how to make sure tis doesn't happen in the future, since I only sell 1-2 items a year and this is the first time I've ever even heard of paying with an e-check.

So I purchased a lot worth about 1000$.

I paid for the lot and asked the seller for a tracking number because he said it was shipped but did not mark it shipped.

After 3-4 days and no reply to my messages I opened a case. The seller got upset and wanted us to close the case but we said we wouldnt close it until we received the item(cause you cant reopen a case if you need to).

The seller threatened to contact the postal service and have the box sent back to him (can you even do that??). We ignored it.

Now the seller says his item was sent back to him because our address was wrong. He sent a picture of a paypal screen with an address with my name on it that I have never seen before! The address was even in the USA and I live in Canada.

I have two guesses for how this happened. 
1.) Either this seller is trying to scam us
OR
2.) Someone gained access to my account and marked the item to be shipped to a different address.

Ebay,GSP and Combined Invoices,"Before you jump and say ""you can't invoice a GSP order,"" read on.

Had a buyer yesterday make an offer on a GSP item that I accepted. The order showed up as a GSP order and prevented sending a manual invoice. This is expected and all is good.

This morning, the buyer purchased two more items and managed to somehow request an invoice for the three. I was under the impression that sellers couldn't invoice and buyers couldn't request total for GSP orders, but apparently that isn't entirely accurate.

My selling screen now shows the three items requesting a total. None are labeled as a GSP sale and the invoice screen is showing me the buyer's international address (Australia) and asking me to specify shipping costs as if it were a normal international order.

I'm kind of unsure of where to go from here. The three items purchased were all set to provide international only though the GSP, there were no other international options and as such the invoice screen has no shipping options pre-filled in. Calculated shipping is about twice what the GSP rate advertises (the items are posters, as a result the packaging is irregular).

Anyone else had a similar situation or dealt with GSP orders of multiple items? How did it work out?

For now I've messaged the buyer saying I can't invoice a GSP order, to make payment using the automated invoice, and to contact me if they have problems doing so.

**EDIT: For anyone curious, the buyer resolved it by checking out through ebay.com instead of ebay.com.au. It seems that the international sites have issues with this to the point of letting buyers potentially skip the GSP on orders that allow no alternative shipping. Wonderful.**",0.0,4,2013-10-08,EBAY,0.06554071605205536,0.9089434146881104,0.02551581896841526
Ebay,Shut down by eBay...your thoughts on opening under a new name?,"Pretty much like the title says, if you glance at my posting history you'll see all the details.

Pretty lost as I've piles of seasonal inventory and frankly not enough time to devote to learning the ins and outs of etsy or amazon right now (I'm working 2 jobs). I'm debating in my head the ethics of just reopening under a different name if only to move out autumn and vintage Christmas stock. Does anyone know anything about this? Is it allowed? Is it technically possible? Do I use a different name or Paypal?

Ebay,Paying to a different Paypal address,"I purchased an article on Sunday and shortly thereafter paid over Paypal. The next day the transaction still wasn't complete and it stated, that the email address of the seller was not registered. After a short conversation with the seller, s/he told me that that s/he put in a wrong email address on ebay, but now put in the right one. Later s/he told me, that there still seems to be a problem. Because the change occured after the auction was over, the ebay checkout still seems to use the old wrong email (I was told by the seller). He send me the correct email address that I now should use for the Paypal payment.

I'm not sure what how I should proceed right now. I already canceled the first payment, but the money is still being held by paypal right now. Should I try again directly through the ebay checkout or pay directly to the email the seller told me? Do changes really not affect already finished auctions?

Ebay,Buyer not saying what size he wants,"Hi,

Question for you all: I'm selling something with size variations. Since I'm a new seller, I don't want to use up all 10 of my maximum listings per month with different variations. So I made 1 listing for an item without setting up variations, and in the listing I ask buyers to specify which size they want in the order notes.

I got an order yesterday for an item, but the buyer didn't say what size he wanted. I've messaged him twice since then, but he hasn't responded. I can't ship the item out until I know what size he wants.

What should I do? Just keep waiting? Will this waiting hurt me because my shipping will seem like it's delayed? I got an email from eBay reminding me to ship, so I'm wondering if this will count against me somewhere on some statistic. I normally ship the day of a sale.

Ebay,How to buy a GSM phone without being scammed,"So the problem with GSM phones is that the seller of the phone still has the IMEI number. Therefore, they can just call the company and have the IMEI number blocked at any time. It could happen 6 months after you buy the phone. Is there any advice to follow when buying a phone to prevent that from happening?

From what I've read a common insurance scam is from people who can't make payments on a contract phone that has theft insurance. They sell the phone and then report the IMEI as stolen so that they get the money from ebay and the insurance company. The ebay charge will be reversed, but they still make out with the insurance money and the buyer has to go through a lot of trouble.

Any ideas?

Ebay,Ebay Closed my Seller account because of a 4.5 shipping rating....,"So my wife and I had an E-bay account to sell random stuff (mostly toys my kids have grown out of). We have been selling stuff for a few years now, not high volume  (only 371 transactions). 

Today, my wife went to check the listings and found that they were all removed and a notice that our account has been suspended indefinitely.

She called Ebay to find out what was going on and they tell her that over the last year 6 buyers have given her only 4 stars for her shipping time and that this is what got the account canceled. All other ratings were 5 starts and the feedback positive.

She pointed out that all 6 of the 4 star ratings were given when the package was sent parcel post (delivered within 9 days). E-bay also gives a bunch of time before the seller has to ship. We always shipped within a week of payment.

Their response was ""E-bay strives for 5 stars for all of their seller and anything below that is not acceptable."" She spoke to a supervisor and got the same response. She was told that we can no longer sell on the site and if we try the account will just be shut down.

Ebay,I think a seller used my paypal email to sign me up for bizopp spam.,"Not sure exactly what to do about this.

I bought something a few days ago on ebay, did the auto checkout, sent the seller my $82 via linked paypal.

My paypal account is the only place that lists my name with just a first initial. i.e. if my name were Bob Charismatist, Paypal thinks my name is B CHARISMATIST. Nowhere else has this.

Within hours of completing the transaction, I started to receive spammy emails that claim I'd signed up to view a webinar about some BS biz opportunity ""Make Monkey Fast"" affiliate marketing thing. I've now gotten four to my inbox, I haven't checked my spam folder yet.

Point is, every single one of them start ""Welcome B""

I think it's highly likely that this seller took my paypal address and decided to try to make a bit extra by submitting it for various affiliate marketing things.

Ebay,"Need some help on how I should proceed, buyer is complaining but not asking me to do anything.","So I sold a SonicWall router on my eBay. [Link to product](http://www.sonicguard.com/NSA-240.asp?gclid=CKbu0OX6jroCFVFp7AodAQwAXw)  This device is a router/firewall/vpn but it is also a content filter.  Usually the selling point of this device is that I can transfer its ownership to someone else when purchased.  Anyways I listed in it's description that it is a content filter, but content filtering is and always is a licensed service through the device.  So basically the device makes it possible to do but you have to pay for licensing to actually make it work.  I only put ""content filter"" in the listing and not in the description.

Anyways, so buyer buys, i transfer ownership, everything is fine until a week later I get a message that it doesn't have content filtering and basically I'm a lier.  I explain that content filtering by it's nature is a licensed service and that I stopped paying the license after I transferred the device but that the device is a content filter.  He proceed to send me like 3 message about how I didn't have a disclaimer and that if I listed porsche as a feature he would expect a porsche, anyways they all seemed very confrontational but didn't ask me to fix the problem.  Keep in mind that I cannot except returns because of the transfer thing.  so I send him a message and explain that I am sorry I didn't mean to mislead, but that the device description and nature of content filtering is alway a licensed service and that you can buy a device that is capable of running this service and one that isn't and that was the distinction.  So, I get one message back about how I am feeding him bull crap and how would that sound in front of a judge, I am feeling threatened at this point.  So I send him a message saying that he hasn't asked me for anything or tried to solve the problem and I feel threatened. Then I feel a little bad so I offer to pay for 30 days of content filtering, which is around $30.

After this I decide to see what he bought the device for so I look at my paypal and its a company name, I google it and he is a reseller for network hardware.  He has my device listed on his site for a good markup, that doesn't bother me, what bothers me is that he knows full well what the device is capable of, and how content filtering works.  I think he was hoping that there was license left on it and he could sell it with a bigger markup, but why would I pay for service after I transferred the device.  Anyways I don't know what I should do this is the first time I have ever had something like this happen.  And it's really bothering me.

Ebay,"Seller finally agreed to a refund, but what if he doesn't pay back the full amount?","Hi guys, bit of an issue and query I have on the eBay resolution centre. I'd be very appreciative of any advice.

eBay UK and both the seller and myself are from the uk.

.

*Backstory:*

- I ordered a laptop on ebay from a private seller, and on my first use with it I found that one of its ports are faulty, which was not stated in the description or condition.

- I told this to the seller, and we've tried to sort it out without opening a case so far:

- First the seller said get the manufacturer to tell me how much the repair would be and he would cover some of the cost. I took it to the manufacturer and they printed out a repair form that states what needs to be done and the cost. The cost of repair is ridiculously high.

- I realised there is an alternative shortcut solution which would be getting an adapter for another port to convert its function to that of the faulty one - but the item would still be faulty (and therefore not worth the money I paid for it.) and so I said to the seller if I this solution I would expect a partial refund, which I said is just a suggestion and I do not expect this.

- He declined my proposed partial refund, which is fine because what I would prefer would be a full refund, which the seller then also declined.

- He said he would only give me a *partial* refund *if* I sent the item back to him. And that the reduction of the refund would cover his expense of using a courier which we never agreed on a price for - he listed the item with ""Free Postage"" so I know i should not have this deducted from my refund.

.


**So,** after numerous messages back and forth I opened a case on ebay within the resolution centre hoping to get a full refund via ebay/paypal money back guarantee. 
He finally said that he will give me a full refund but said this via email not via the resolution centre correspondence. 
I am worried that if I send the item back to him he will go back on his word and not give me the full refund, as he was reluctant to doing so previously.

(Also initially he said i underpaid him by ~3% but I have proof on my paypal and bank account that I sent the full amount. I am guessing he incurred some instant paypal seller fees for a high priced item? 
So I'm worried that he'll refund the amount he claims to have been paid rather than what I paid him.)

I would rather use ebay's money back guarantee or paypals buyer protection rather than just 'work it out between the two of you.' Can I do this even if the seller now says he'll refund me?

(**TLDR;**)

Even if the seller agrees to a refund, that would mean me posting the item to him and then hoping for a full refund which I do not think he will give me.
Am I allowed to just wait to escalate the case and hope I get ebay/paypal buyer protection money back guarantee, even if now he *says* he'll give me a refund.

Also If I sent the item back and only receive a partial refund how do I get the rest of my money?

Ebay,Advice wanted - faulty wedding ring,"Hi. My friend has asked me to help her out with a situation and I would really appreciate any advice. She ordered a wedding ring from an American seller (we are in the UK) earlier in the year for her wedding in September. The morning after the wedding, having worn it for less than 24 hours, she noticed one of the diamonds had fallen out. She wrote to the seller explaining her situation, only to receive a very rude email saying that because the diamonds were 'micro mounted' (it doesn't mention this anywhere in the original ad) there is a risk that the diamonds will fall out. The only solutions he put forward were that she purchase a sturdier version of the same ring from himself for $500 dollars, purchase another diamond from him (and pay to have it fitted herself) or return it for a 60% refund.

This seems shocking to me. It wasn't the most expensive ring but it wasn't cheap either... and it is her wedding ring.

She has asked me to respond on her behalf as she is understandably upset by the situation and by the seller's rude attitude. Unfortunately, because the ring was bought earlier in the year (although not worn until the wedding) it is too late to open a case with ebay or Paypal.

The seller finally responds claiming computer problems (next day after opening case), ships the item and provides tracking info. After about 5 more days the package arrives, item is as expected.

Due to the delay and ignoring my messages I am not happy with the seller. I am leaning heavily toward dinging the seller's stars for communication and shipping time and am contemplating leaving a negative or at least a neutral. A positive is out of the question IMO.

I'm curious how /r/Ebay would handle this.

**EDIT**: Based on advice here and my own thoughts on the matter, I didn't leave a negative since the item did eventually arrive and was as described, and opted instead for a neutral with the comment, ""Room for improvement"". I did hit the seller with 1 star each on communication and shipping time though.

Ebay,"Just bought a fragile Halloween Jack O' Lantern on ebay. Unfortunately, it arrived shattered. This is the email exchange. Am I wrong here?","Dear seller,

Unfortunately, the pumpkin arrived completely shattered. However, it was strange that it was neatly assembled inside a plastic shopping bag inside the bubble wrap.

    me

Dear me,

OH NO! We are very sorry this happened since you wanted it to replace the one ""I think your daughter broke"". If it broke inside the bubble wrap, it would stay broken inside just like the pieces were together when shipped. We were careful to wrap and mark box fragile at post office. I think this was double boxed too! Shipping was $12.07 actual for standard shipping uninsured. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee careful postal carriers. We wish we could! I myself had a rare Van Brigle sculpture shattered as well that I bought on ebay. I remember how sad I was. My heart goes out to you. If we find another one like it, we'll get in touch with you!

    seller

Dear seller,

Of course - I know you did what you could to ensure it was safe; however, it's still a broken item.

I appreciate your efforts while searching for another, but I'm going to have to try to repair this in the meantime.

I do believe that a small refund is in order though.

Thanks

    me

Dear me,

We are sorry on behalf of the postal carrier. Perhaps you could talk to your carrier when he comes to your door next and ask him/her to do something nice for you since they mishandled the box! We wish we could refund for things that postal carriers or whomever mishandle items that we pack carefully. We surely intend for the items to reach people safely!!! Note: you were charged $8.50 for shipping and actual cost was $12.07 and we cannot ask buyers to pay additional. Seems we all seem to lose in the end!!! We look to tomorrow for better days! We sincerely wish you good luck and even better luck in your future purchases!!

    seller

Dear seller,

I don't believe this is the way it works. I purchased an item from you with the intent that I would receive it in one piece. While the postal carrier is the one responsible for the breakage, you - the seller - are responsible until it gets to my door. As a seller, it's your duty to ensure that the item arrives as advertised. If you cannot guarantee that, then you shouldn't be selling fragile items.

Regarding your note - you're not doing me a favor by saving me in shipping. This is business, and if you're losing money, then that's your issue.

I'm not looking for a full refund - as I have the item (albeit in pieces); however, a good faith gesture is strongly recommended. A pat on the back and the words, ""sorry"" do not cut it.

Finally, how do I know that it wasn't already broken and you're passing it off on the carrier?

    me

Dear me,

You could believe if you wanted to! This is how it works! Please check the rules with eBay! It is not the sellers ""duty"" to make sure the item arrives unbroken. The auction listing clearly states we are not responsible for uninsured items. We have not seen the pumpkin broken in the box. It was not in the box when we took the picture! You could show your postal carrier to whom the responsibility lays or ""the neighbor kids for playing with the box"". It clearly is not the sellers fault. These things happen and we encourage buyers to buy insurance so they are covered and can get reimbursed for damage to make them happy. You could trust the seller of over 20 years on ebay to know the ways of business on ebay. We wish you luck in future dealings with ebay sellers! Sorry to disappoint you. No refunds for uninsured broken items. We do our best and try to stay on top of ebay rules.

We are not wealthy, ebay selling is for gas money. We'd love to give you a million if we win the lottery! You are correct about losing money on shipping. We never want to over-inflate shipping cost averages. Sometimes we lose a lot due to shipping to CA, NY, NJ for some reason (over mountains?) We don't know ahead of time who will win and where we will ship. Thus we take many losses.

Have a better evening! Hugs and Kisses too!

Ebay,"After all the negative stuff I see here about Ebay, I was a little worried when I finally had a problem...","I sold an item for about $40. It is larger and I listed shipping at $42. I planned to ship FedEx. After the buyer won the auction, she demanded it be sent via USPS. Just shipping USPS would have been $94.

I tried to tell her how much more shipping would be; she called me a liar and became somewhat belligerent. I remained polite and professional and tried to work out a fair option. She said I was not to contact her and she expected USPS delivery. 

I called ebay three times: 

1. The first rep told me to cancel the transaction. 

I did so. The buyer refused to agree to a cancel transaction. 

2. I called ebay to see what would happen next. The second rep told me to refund her via paypal and to call ebay if she left negative feedback. 

I did so. And she left really mean feedback. She said I demanded more money and I didn't refund. Both lies. 

3. The third rep wiped out the negative feedback. It was gone within minutes of us hanging up. 

So I know ebay gets a bad rap for customer service and always siding with the buyer, but they were completely helpful and professional in my situation.

Ebay,Latest line of Ebay troubles. Buyer now wants me to ship to Russia even though I only ship to UK.,"This is kind of a follow up to another issue I posted about.

I'm listing some things on ebay and have had a lot of interest from Russian buyers. One item had a few offers to pay me immediately if I took the item down. I refused and ended up getting more than they offered me.

One of the users who made an offer has won another of my items. I only ship to the UK and it says that on my listings.

He sent me a message saying he has addresses in the UK and Russia asking if I would ship the item signed for to Russia instead. I have heard nothing but horror stories about shipping to Russia.

I also have a feeling that I will run in to problems if I ship to his UK address which, after doing some research, I found out is a warehouse registered to a small Russian business. I know this could all be above board but I've seen The Wire.

What can I do to cover myself? I don't want negative feedback, and I'd be happy to ship to him, but what if the item goes 'missing' etc. Can I get in trouble if I refuse to send it to Russia and he takes exception to that?

Ebay,"Buyers demanding extra items not listed in auctions - Sellers, how do you deal with these problem children?","So I'm a seller on eBay of almost anything under the sun and I think most people would be surprised at the amount of people who ""buy it now"" then want to cancel the sale or leave offers that get accepted hanging and never actually follow through with the sale.

But that being normal time wasting activity dealt with in stride, what I'm dealing with is a buyer demanding that I send them extra items (in this case a SD card for a Tom Tom that doesn't ""need"" one). The title read the usual ""BT SD Card Slot Touch Screen"" kind of garb that one uses for search keywords, but nowhere was it pictured or implied that the item came with an SD card, only that it harbored a SD card slot, which not all versions of this particular item do. Also I put in big bold letters that the item was turned on an touch screen tested, but being sold AS IS because no further testing was done.


So in any case, buyer leaves me neg feedback in broken english saying that I'm a ""fake seller and make unclear listing"". To which i reported the buyer to eBay, requested a feedback change, followed up on mine and his feedback explaining the problem, and msged them expressing how unfair I think their feedback was. It matters more to me than most because a lot of the items I move on eBay are hundreds of dollars and I don't sell more than a few times a week.

Ebay,eBay buyer threatening legal action...,"Hi guys,

My mum has gotten herself in a spot of bother on eBay. My dad passed away a few years back and my mum has now found a new partner and they are  both selling their houses to buy a place together.

My mum has been going through all the junk in her house to sell on eBay before the big move (mostly things like Lego, Clothes, Old Toys etc)

She recently listed an antique item of furniture on eBay that used to belong to my dad and has been in our family as long as I can remember, but its quite big and heavy and she doesn't want to take it with her when she moves, not to mention it won't fit with their new ultra-modern house.

She listed it on eBay for a Buy it Now for around £1000. She called me (as I have my own eBay business) shortly after to ask how she could add more photos to the listing once it was live. I was shocked that she was selling this particular item as it was my dad's pride and joy, and I advised her to let my brother know she was selling it.

She calls my brother, he goes mad and asks her to take it off eBay immediately, but before she has a chance to remove it,  somebody buys it through Buy it Now (they didn't even make an offer).

They literally bought it, 20 minutes after the item had been listed, and it was on a 30 day listing. Before the buyer paid for the item, my mum sends him a message explaining the situation and that she is very sorry that she can't sell it. 

He then replies stating that this happens to him all the time and he is sick of it, and will sue her for £2000+ because he saw a similar item sell for £3000 a few years ago and he wants the difference back.

Today she received a letter from his solicitors demanding £3400 compensation, or the sale of the original item.

She is obviously very concerned and feels bullied by this guy. eBay sent her a standard warning message telling her not to do this again in the future or she could risk her account being suspended (which is fair enough I guess).

But where does she stand legally? Can this guy really sue her for an eBay transaction that he never even paid for and was cancelled within minutes of him buying it?

Ebay,Brand new ebayer; sold and shipped my phone to buyer; now they're claiming it's defective and I think I'm being scammed,"So, here's the background. My brother and I shared a cell phone plan for several years and split the cost. He recently switched to another plan with Verizon, leaving me holding the bag on a $120 monthly bill. I recently switched carriers for a cheaper monthly bill, and now have an extra phone I can't use, since Verizon phones don't work with other carriers.

I put the listing on ebay. To my great surprise it sold overnight at the Buy It Now! price. Then I get a message from the buyer asking for me to send him my Paypal e-mail address; clearly a scam. It takes a few days to get this sorted out with eBay, but they invalidate the listing and I relist the item.

The [auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/161123311543?ssPageName=STRK:MESOX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1561.l2649) proceeds and eventually sells to a real person instead of a spambot. I pack up the item, record a video of the boxing up process, and send it to the winner.

She receives it and immediately sends me messages IN ALL CAPS talking about how the phone is not as described and that she demands a refund.

""VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT YOUR LISTING CONTAINED FALSE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION.  THIS PHONE IS UNABLE TO HEAR THE PERSON YOU ARE CALLING, IT IS FULL OF STATIC AND NEITHER MYSELF OR THE PERSON I CALLED. I AM RETURNING THIS ITEM TO YOU TOMORROW AND I EXPECT TO RECIEVE A 100% REFUND OF PAYMENT MADE AND SHIPPING COSTS.""

I'm at a loss; ebay is clearly pro-buyer and I'm at a disadvantage off the bat. On top of that, I'm a brand new user and have no selling history. I protected myself every way I could think of:

1. I created a one-take video of the item that demonstrates the item is in proper working order, packed up everything, put it in the box, and sealed it.

2. I took out insurance on the item even though it sold for less than $250. In fact, the user told me to put insurance on the item, which I felt was strange but chalked it up to them wanting to be sure their purchase was protected.

3. I required a delivery confirmation signature.

I feel like I'm going to be steamrolled by ebay's resolution process, and the buyer is counting on it.

There are some fishy things about the account. The bulk of her profile appears to be built on selling cheap items. She has sold [three](http://www.ebay.com/itm/HTC-T-Mobile-G2-Titanium-T-Mobile-Smartphone-/200954160744?pt=Cell_Phones&amp;hash=item2ec9cd2668) [cell](http://www.ebay.com/itm/VERIZON-HTC-Droid-Eris-5MP-Camera-Android-Smartphone-CANNOT-CHARGE-/200952685524?pt=Cell_Phones&amp;hash=item2ec9b6a3d4) [phones](http://www.ebay.com/itm/MOTOROLA-DROID-2-A955-Black-for-Verizon-Smartphone-Good-Cond-/200946077516?pt=Cell_Phones&amp;hash=item2ec951cf4c) since July, and two of them have been defective in some way. Her one negative mark on the account appears to be attempting to sell a fourth phone to someone, but the item was (wait for it...) not as described and the user demanded a refund. I'm not entirely sure if I'm reading things properly because I'm not used to how ebay is listing all the information.

Here's what I think is going on: she has a defective Galaxy S3 that she can't sell and wants to fob it off on me, so she wins my auction and pays with Paypal, knowing that once she begins the refund process, ebay will refund her money and she winds up with my phone and the money she paid for it while sending me her defective phone.

She picked the one thing that I don't have documentation of; that my phone works as a phone. I had already switched off service and there was no way to prove that the phone had good call quality. I didn't even think about it, to be honest. The last time I used ebay was a few years back, and my experience as a buyer and seller was always very pleasant.

You spent days bidding on an item, only to lose in the last 2 minutes, and have nothing to show for it. You listed your phone, hoping to make at least $400, but the auction ended at $320, which leaves you with $278 thanks to insane fees. 

We've all experienced at least one of these things, and it shouldn't have to be this way. 

My cousin and I are building a marketplace for the users, not the shareholders, and we want you guys to take part. Feel free to ask us questions and provide suggestions. We want to know your idea of the perfect online marketplace. :)

Ebay,"Has something happened, or have I just been unlucky lately?","In the last couple of months I've been doing pretty well with selling my things, mostly my own clothes that I've held on to for ages but never worn.

However, in the last week I've had 2 items where the auction ended over 3 days ago, and I'm still waiting for payment.  The week before that, I had an item that sold but I never received payment so I relisted it (which took way too long IMO, especially since I didn't know how unpaid item cases work and waited a few days before I even opened a case).

Both of the buyers have decent buyer feedback saying they paid straight away for previous auctions, so I'm wondering if there might be some problems with Paypal or eBay.co.uk, or are my buyers just being douches?

Ebay,PID number and Label Number question.,So I was at the post office today and I see them scanning all my stuff with what I thought was a tracking number. It turns out there are two different things. A Label Number and a PID Number. One actually tracks the package to its destination and the other just says the post office received the item. I have been using the PID number a lot and have not had any issues. If some shady person said they never got their package with the PID number and not the full tracking number to the doorstep can they still file a complaint and win? Most of my sales are under 50 bucks so I know the rules and do get signature for items over $100.00.

Ebay,"This is a scam, right?","I'm using craigslist to look for an apartment in a large metropolitan area. I replied to an ad that seemed too good to be true (fully furnished with nice-looking stuff, VERY low price for it's location), but I thought I'd try anyway. Got an email back with a more detailed description of the apartment and asking a little about myself, so I replied. Here's the email I got back after that. Is Ebay real estate a legit thing people use for apartment rentals?



&gt; I would be more than happy to rent my apartment to you.
The apartment still has tenants but they are due to move-out, next week, it will be free and available for you to move-in shortly after, once it has been cleaned, you can move-in right away or you can secure it now and move-in later. The rental period will start from the day you move-in, lease is month-to-month. 

&gt; I no longer live in the United States. I have moved to Europe 5 years ago with my husband, after we got married, we now live in Budapest, Hungary. 
All our properties in the US are managed and rented with eBay Real Estate, the apartment can be rented only online with their service.

&gt; Since I presume you are not familiar with eBay's Real Estate Tenant, I have briefly described the rental steps below: 

&gt; 1. Landlord, Tenant reach an agreement ( rent: 2 months in advance, refundable deposit: one month, lease period: month to month ) 
&gt; 2. Tenant deposits the money as security to an eBay Real Estate Agent by wire transfer in Hungary. 
&gt; 3. The eBay Agent holds the funds as escrow, in custody, unavailable to the landlord, so the tenant can inspect the property.
&gt; 4. The tenant receives the keys and rental documentation from eBay Real Estate.
&gt; 5. The Tenant inspects the property for 5 days and informs eBay Real Estate about his decision. 
&gt; 6. eBay Real Estate releases the funds to the landlord only if the tenant has inspected the property only if he is satisfied with it and has decided to rent it. 
   &gt; If the tenant decides not to rent the property the tenant will return the keys and lease to eBay to receive a full refund.

&gt; As you can see, you will view and inspect the apartment BEFORE any money is released to me. You will get the chance to inspect it while your money is still safely held in eBay's account. ONLY if you have decided to rent the property and have emailed the eBay Agent that you are satisfied with the apartment, will they release the money to me. If for whatever reason, you change your mind, eBay will send you your money back, including any transfer fees paid, if you decide not to rent the property you will receive the money back in full once the lease and keys have been returned. 

&gt; The rental agreement, keys, parking assignment ( 2 gated parking spots ) access cards, etc will be mailed via FedEx OvernightExpress.

&gt; To set up the rental with eBay Real Estate please email me:

&gt; The name of the tenant that will be renting the apartment:
&gt; The mailing address where you can receive the keys, lease, etc :
&gt; The move-in date and period you are going to rent the apartment:",5.0,0,2013-10-19,EBAY,0.049426477402448654,0.9198906421661377,0.030682817101478577
Ebay,Bought an item local and item was broken,"So someone was selling a car part on ebay and he didn't have his item listed to allow local pickup but i noticed he lived close to me so clicked buy but didn't pay and just messaged him my number so we can setup a local pickup.

I went to his home and picked up the item and he said it was working fine and had no issues. 

Once i got home i installed it on my car and it had an issue, he said he would take it back but a few days later once i got it off the car he said his return policy is 14 days as listed on the ebay page and he will not take the item back.

I noticed the item i bought was not marked as ""paid for"" or ""buyer has paid""

What can i do about this? 

Can i open a case?

Ebay,Printing large colored EBAY logo on shipping labels (Germany specific),"Hi, I know that some EBAYers are lurking around to ""probe and feel the social media"" so I'm going to put my little rant here: so, le mich ;), red star, more than 1,6K sales, 100% Bewertungen, observe that the PDF shipping labels bought via EBAY now have a large EBAY Logo in vivid colours ( all the rest is B/W).

Oh well, I've said, another victory for the marketing ( even if I would rather have no logo there or eventually my logo ) that nobody asked for but I can live with that.


That was starting ca. 10-20 sales back (ca. 2 weeks back), and guess what, I've got the unpleasant surprise to have open cases against me for item not delivered, including a bad feedback with something like: ""Hey a-hole, this is what you get for keeping money and no shipping"".


Well, I've refunded the people with their items missing, managed to get the bad Bewertung erased after a call with a very helpful kid.


So far so good, during this call I have mentioned the fact that I'd rather not have the bloody EBAY logo sticking out on every parcel because here in Germany the postman usually leaves the uninsured parcels in front on the door or on neighbors and theu stay there but now when someone sees that EBAY logoed parcel laying around just says: ""Geil, mein neue iPhone is da..."" and grabs it.


The customer support kid did suggest cutting the logo or using a corector white pen to cover it but come on this a hack, I'm paying good commision and I should be able to turn this shit off at least on the parcels without signature.


So the kid also promised that he will escalate the issue to the upper echelons ( I didn't hold my breath), but lo and behold, I'm getting an email about my issue., so far so good, let's read it...

&lt;RANT OFF/&gt;


Well guys, if your bloody focus groups and marketing research told you you have to do some (miserable) things, like this crap, or removing the items descriptions in feedback, and the PAYING users have nothing to say about that, try at least to show a bit of sensitivity and concern and don't send emails that practically calls you a stupid fool and tell in a patronizing tone that ""you will start to like it as well"", like the other crap we've implemented and in the beginning everybody hate it but now everybody loves it. 


TL;DR EBAY puts a huge color logo on the B/W shipping labels ordered trough them that makes the parcels targets for thief and send patronizing mail that ""we know better than you"" and ""you'll learn to love it"".",4.0,0,2013-10-20,EBAY,0.07228029519319534,0.9019448757171631,0.025774778798222542

What I think has happened is that the second invoice I received wasn't via eBay, it was instead for a gift payment or something similar. Is this a common scam on eBay? Can I get my money back?

Ebay,Is USPS supposed to charge me if I ask for a scan receipt on pre-printed postage?,"So today I went down to the post office in order to drop off two items I had sold over the weekend. I printed my postage through eBay as usual.

Eventually he comes up to me in the line and realizes that I've already paid for my postage. He doesn't really say I could use the self service area and I think my boxes were too big for the dropbox anyway. I told him that I wanted to wait in line so I could get a scan receipt. He proceeds to tell me that I'm going to have to pay $1.20 per package for a scan receipt since I already received my discount online (I don't follow his logic). I told him that I've never been charged for this before and remain in the line. He assures me that the workers at the counter will tell me the same thing and ""something, something, New Regulations, something, something, I'm the Assistant to the Supervisor...""

Eventually I make it up to the counter, give them my boxes, ask for a scan receipt, and walk out a minute later with my receipt in hand and no money exchanging hands. 

So, did the postal worker at the counter give me a $2.40 hook-up today, or does the Assistant to the Supervisor need to go study the postal regulations some more?",9.0,1,2013-10-21,EBAY,0.0357716828584671,0.9307229518890381,0.03350535035133362

Ebay,"New to selling, really only wanted to do it once, did I do something (possibly) really stupid?","Hey there guys,

I had something to sell that could be just sent through an email address. I went ahead and put it on and someone bought it after about 24 hours. The payment was received, so I sent him the item through the Ebay email client. After that I kindly asked him to mark it as item received, and to possibly add feedback, as I would do the same. Well that was a couple of hours ago and I have received any messages from him since.

Then it dawned on me:

Can't this person just simply say he didn't receive the item? Since I have no tracking for the shipment? If so, what kind of backlash could I see from that? Would I be out the item? 

Sorry for such questions, I am just really new at this stuff.

Thanks!

Ebay,"Buyer was being shady, and now I think he's trying to violate policy and go around eBay to get a better deal. Advice?","Alright, here are the facts. Hang in there, this will be long. I have an eBay store, and selling on eBay's gone pretty well so far. About a month ago I listed an old Apple Mac Classic II that was in really good shape. It actually had all of its parts and was in awesome working condition. I listed it for $55 and eBay estimated the shipping to be an additional $20. I'd like to add that there were about 10 pictures of everything included in the listing. Detailed pictures of the monitor(off and on), keyboard and cover, mouse and cables, etc. There was also my standard disclaimer stating that the item was AS IS and would include everything pictured.

A guy that I'll call Mork ended up having the winning bid, and sent his PayPal payment for the full amount. I then do my due diligence and start packing all of the components for shipping. While trying to prep it, I realize that none of my shipping boxes are quite big enough to fit everything. No big deal, right? Instead of just buying a bigger box, I go ahead and decide to pop into the UPS Store and just have them professionally pack the thing, so there won't be any chance of damage during the transit process. It costs $20 for fragile pack service, and shipping the box from the UPS store costs a fair bit more than through the Post Office, so I drive my 'FRAGILE' box over to the Post Office and ship it off to Mork. Altogether, packing and shipping cost $40, but since I didn't state that it would cost that much initially, I decide that if Mork won't cover the additional shipping charges, I'll just bite the bullet. It's worth it to me, because I'm flying across the country the next day and I want to have everything shipped out that needs to be out.

So cut to a few days later... Mork messages me. He claims he didn't get everything that was supposed to be included in the listing. He's filed a claim against me for not sending the item as described, and we're in the 'work it out amongst yourselves' stage. I try to calmly figure out what's up, but he's being pretty unreasonable. It sounds like he's sitting at his computer with a thesaurus trying to make his responses sound so smart and superior to me. He's using big, 'smart' words to try and elude me, but the words don't even make sense the way he's using them! He mostly just calls me a fraud, without any real cause. It occurs to me that he might have decided he just didn't want to pay for anything. I stay cool, through him throwing out insults and calling me a stupid fraud, and explain that I had everything packed at the UPS Store, and unless the box was damaged, it's all there. He says that his mouse and cables are somehow magically gone, but doesn't answer me regarding box damage. He just keeps hurling insults, so I eventually stop replying and wait for eBay to investigate his claims. I am pretty green as a seller, so I've never had a case against me before. I make sure that I have my detailed UPS reciepts, and my USPS one just in case. I have pictures of everything before it shipped, but I don't know how else I'll defend myself. So I wait...


And then yesterday I got a message from eBay. They have decided that he will get a full refund if he ships everything back to me as he got it. I'm interested to see what exactly he will ship back, but there's nothing I can do at this point. 

THEN today THIS happened. If you've held on through all of this, you deserve a hearty handshake. I know it's really long. I just didn't know how else to explain.

I get a text message. It's from an unfamiliar number and it says that it's Mork, and he bought the missing mouse and cables somewhere else for cheap. He asks for my email address so he can send me the details for working this all out nicely.

Wat.

What is this guy trying to do? Is he just going to email me a 'reasonable' offer outside of eBay so I'll settle for some cop out payment and he won't have to actually ship me anything? NOT COOL. Instead of calling him out though, I simply reply with my email address, to see what he says. I'm hoping that I'm handing him enough rope to hang himself with, and I can take the screenshots of his texts and emails to eBay and get my payment and his account banned. I know I'll never get the money for the extra shipping back, but it's the principle at this point. I'm almost positive that what he's trying to do is against their policy, since he got my number from the portion of the agreement that had my shipping address on it. I didn't even realize it was visible, so I took it down immediately.

Has this happened to any of you? Any advice as to what I should do or how to handle it/report it or anything? I'm mad, but I managed to refrain from blowing up his phone with messages. I'd rather watch him get himself in trouble, but I don't know how to prevent this in the future.

TL;DR Buyer is being weird and possibly shady, but the item was not crazy expensive or valuable. Now he's trying to get his full refund, but is contacting me outside of eBay about 'working it out' so he won't have to return the item. What is up with this, and has it happened to you?

Update: Messaged the guy through eBay and took the advice from the comments. Said that I received a message from someone claiming to be him, but I'd rather keep everything above board and go through eBay only. He then condemned himself in his reply to me, saying that I was stupid for handing him the refund and asking for the computer back when we could just settle this a different way, since he isn't going to send it to me. It's pretty clear that he has everything I sent and is claiming to have bought the 'missing' parts somewhere else. On hold with eBay. Now I have proof.

The tracking only includes info about the city and state, which was correct, but the item was not there. I asked the buyer to be patient as I worked it through with the USPS. But he was not patient and filed a dispute and asked for an immediate refund. Paypal eventually supported a refund based solely on the tracking info. 

Meanwhile, the USPS denied my insurance claim. I had no evidence to provide them since it simply never appeared despite a delivery status to the contrary. I have appealed it twice, it was denied twice, both times with the only supporting evidence being that ""delivered"" line from the tracking.

So, I am screwed- no money, no item, no evidence other than the USPS' claim that I'm wrong, the item did arrive. 

It has occurred to me the buyer is trying to scam me, but there appears to be no protection whatsoever for this outcome.  It appears to be a perfect storm of apathy, fraud, and/or error.

Has anyone ever recovered their money in a case like this? What blows my mind is there's very little room for discussion in the process at all. Just a simple no. No offer to investigate at the other end, no further questions for me, no nothing. Classic monopolistic attitude- though they aren't a monopoly anymore.

Never, ever again, USPS. I'll use you to return netflix discs, but otherwise we're done. There's just no excuse.",12.0,1,2013-10-25,EBAY,0.10761892795562744,0.861736536026001,0.03064451366662979

Ebay,Sold item with free shipping. Advertised 1-day overnight express. Buyer sent an eBay message saying I can ship it 3-day.,"This is what was on my listing:

* Free shipping
* United States
* One-day Shipping (USPS Priority Mail Express®)
* Estimated within 2 business days

**All messages were sent through eBay's message system:**

I messaged the buyer saying I can't ship it until Monday morning, is this okay?

The buyer responded yes that is okay.

After a discussion about why I was selling the item, the buyer sent me this message:

&gt;
I am sure shipping a box overnight is going to be expensive. You can send it UPS 3-day Select, or an equivalent USPS 3-day service. That should save you a few bucks.

Now, this is really cool since that is far less expensive than 1-day overnight express.

However, that's not what my listing said shipping would be.

Ebay,Beware of the eBay Global Shipping program,"I listed my iPhone 5 on ebay, allowed for global shipping via ebay's global shipping program. You ship to ebay in the US then they ship to the international buyer. However, there are some excluded countries where you aren't protected and some countries that have a cap on the value that's covered. In my case, the winning bidder was in Russia which has a $250 cap on protected items. BUT SELECTING THE GLOBAL SHIPPING OPTION ENABLES SHIPPING TO THOSE COUNTRIES AND DOESN'T PREVENT THE GUY IN RUSSIA FROM EXCEEDING THE COVERED AMOUNT I MENTIONED ABOVE.

So now I have a guy in Russia that won my item and if I sent it to him, he can just say it's broken. Here's the kicker. The insurance pays out to the RECIPIENT of the package. So if I shipped it, I'd be out my item and he's get the iPhone AND the insurance money.

There are no safeguards to prevent the ineligible people from bidding past the break point where you're not covered.

To fix this problem, I created an exclusion list of places I won't ship to but wow what a mess.

EDIT:  I just got an email from eBay.

I am going to exclude all countries which aren't covered in the future.

The title explains my situation, but let me provide some details. I'm thinking of buying this [keyboard](http://www.ebay.com/itm/151151687755). But since I have never used eBay before, I have no idea how to determine whether a seller is a scammer or not. The seller seems to have good reputation and s/he's registered 3 years ago (I read some threads on this sub to be more informed), so I guess it looks safe but I have some suspicions. The seller has some duplicate positive feedback on his account, I'd contacted him/her about the shipping rate and his English was... not good even though s/he listed himself/herself living in the US. S/he also offered to lower the shipping rate for me (it's $69 with priority shipping and s/he offered to lower it to $35).

Am I right for being cautious here? What would you do for covering your ass?

Ebay,How do I avoid (what I think is) a scam?,"I bought a George Foreman grill on eBay. I got a nice price on it.

It was advertised as new, the drip tray was mentioned. Slight damage to the box was mentioned.

It arrived in the original box. No packaging other than black plastic over it. The original box was very damaged, and inside the plastic shell of the grill was smashed, and there were three large chunks of plastic loose. Also the trip tray and grease scraper were missing.

There is no sign that the courier did the damage - although it's not been properly packaged I'm certain it was damaged when it was sent - there would be some sign of an impact on the box I think. 

I've contacted the seller who has got back to me right away, and said I need to send it back to them for a refund. 

This is where my spidey sense is going off. 

I'm worried that I might be in the progress of getting scammed...

Who pays for return postage?

Am I right in thinking it's between him and his courier company to sort out the damage and I shouldn't be waiting for a refund?

Why does he want me to send it back since it's not useful for anything?

I'm off on holiday early next week so I couldn't send it back for around 3 weeks - can that be used against me?

Is there some trick he can use with the missing items, claiming I didn't return them?

I bought a computer battery that I no longer need and when I asked the seller I want to return it, he said there is a 15% restocking fee, and that if i wanted to save money on shipping and the fee, I should resell it for profit.

I responded that the original listing did not say anything about a restocking fee, and asked if you could show me it if it did. I then asked him do you still insist on a restocking fee? I have not gotten a reply ever since.

Do you think I can initiate buyers protection for this? It seems like it doesn't cover this situation, but a stores return policy is usually factored when purchasing an item. The items return policy description is misleading.

I understand why sellers have a restocking fee, I have no problem with that but the seller should be straight up front about the return policy because it does play a factor where you buy from. 

I would have no problem reselling this supposedly OEM macbook battery, but this shit was  priced cheap at $40 so I have a feeling it's a knockoff or refurbished battery or something anyways (plus he has TONS for this price of these which is hard to believe for an expensive oem battery), so I don't want to sell it and possibly get a negative review on my perfect sellers rating.

Ebay,Problem with the Global Shipping Program. Can anyone help with this?,"Here's the situation, I sold 4 items to a customer in England. I use the eBay turbo lister to list my items. In the template I have set up, I selected the Global Shipping box, calculated shipping for Priority Mail International, and a $1.67 handling fee. (The handling fee covers my padded envelope cost.) 

Now here's what happened. I got the notice that my items sold. Cool. I go to the shipping page and notice that 3 of the items are going off to the global shipping center in KY but one is singled out for me to send to England separate from the others! [Fig. 1](http://i.imgur.com/J8oSEPO.png)

When I look I see that the shipping paid says $0.00 for the Global Shipping Program. That's fine because I know that the payment for that never shows up, I have to pay to ship it to the center because I offer free shipping in the US. What scares me is the $1.67 shipping charge in the single package. It should be more than $1.67 to send an item to England via Priority Mail.

So I click on the create label link and see this: [Fig. 2](http://i.imgur.com/GhpRZnU.png) 

Now I know somethings up. I shouldn't be paying for this! It'd cost me more to ship the thing than I sold it for! WTF! So I go to look at my turbo listing settings to make sure it's set up right.

See that here. [Fig. 3](http://i.imgur.com/zybUr1g.png)

As you can see, everything is set up to collect for shipping via international priority mail thru the Global Shipping Program but it did not go thru that way, and somehow my buyer got away with free international shipping.

My question for you, fellow redditors, is how do I fix this without losing out on $24 bucks? Has this happened to any of you?

Ebay,Buyer misunderstanding what factory unlocked means,"I recently sold an iPhone that had once been locked to a carrier, but was unlocked through iTunes. I sold the phone as factory unlocked. I removed the SIM card before sending it to the buyer. When the seller received it they claimed that it was not factory unlocked because it requires a SIM card (any SIM card). They do not seem to understand that all GSM phones require a SIM card. They also claim that they have other unlocked iPhones that do not require a SIM card. They want to return the phone, which I am willing to take back to not have to deal with the hassle.

My question to /r/ebay is what does ""factory unlocked"" mean to you? 

The title of the listing was ""Apple iPhone 4 - 32GB - Black (AT&amp;T) Smartphone (Factory Unlocked)"". Does this title seem misleading at all?

Of course I am going to resell the phone once I receive it back, so I would like to ensure that this doesn't happen again.",12.0,2,2013-10-29,EBAY,0.040110994130373,0.917586088180542,0.04230286180973053
Ebay,"Buyers too lazy to return item, the dreaded partial refund","So I've been noticing lately a couple of buyers have found it too big of a hassle to repack and ship back items either because of breakage, or they felt I misrepresented the piece.  I feel it's important to get the piece back before I issue a full refund.  Granted, in the case of breakage she still wanted the piece but wanted a partial refund.  The person who claimed it was misrepresented was going to get a paid shipping label but couldn't be bothered to go to the post office. She ended up all caps cursing at me.

Ebay,Question about Ebay protection for shipping to Canada.,"I have a buyer with a rating of 6 who has been buying high priced items in the past months. The buyer recently paid my Buy It Now price for $700 plus extra for shipping. He then messages me and asks if I can mail it to Canada. The buyer is in China but has a friend in Canada that will bring him the item later this month, so he wants me to ship it to Vancouver. His original address was in WI but then updated the paypal address (unconfirmed address) to a Vancouver address. 

I'm hesitant to ship it. I even stated in my description that I don't ship Internationally and I will only ship via USPS with delivery confirmation and a signature so to avoid situations like this one.

I've never shipped internationally or even sold an item of that amount before. I can't seem buy a shipping label with confirmation and signature to Canada. I know that I need the signature to be protected via Ebay's seller protection in case the item doesn't arrive or is damaged.

Does this sound like a scam? I don't want to be a fool and just mail away my item to never see it again when the guy says it wasn't received.

TLDR; Buyer from China wants me to mail a $700 item to his friend in Canada, but I don't know how to ship it so i'm protected from loss or damage.",3.0,1,2013-10-29,EBAY,0.09207982569932938,0.8771161437034607,0.03080405667424202
Ebay,Faith in Ebay UK restored,"I recently sold an electronic item on eBay UK. It was listed as ""not working, for spares or repairs"" and i described the issues that i knew were correct with the item in question.

The guy who won the auction, upon receiving the item, immediately filed a ""not as described"" case because the item.....didn't....work..... I tried to communicate with him but he was having none of it and eventually said he would close the case for a 50% refund. Which i declined.

Thinking that eBay customer support would see the obvious, i escalated the claim to let them sort it out. Unfortunately, it was decided it would be ""fairer"" for both parties to have the item returned for a full refund.

Well, i tweeted eBay UK and asked them for guidance on how to accurately list broken items as my listing was ""apparently"" not as described and linked my listing to the tweet.

An awesome chap at eBay UK tweeted and then emailed me back to ask me to let him know as soon as the laptop was received and in less than 24 hours after receiving the item back, the decision was reversed and the cash was paid into my bank account.

After reading the horror stories that eBay only ever looked out for the buyer I was over the moon at the decision

Ebay,Need some advice regarding a sold item / package interception USPS,"I sold a camera on ebay for $700, payment went through and I shipped the item this afternoon through USPS.

A couple of hours later I received an email from paypal saying that the transaction has been ""held"".

Apparently the buyer didn't authorize the transaction, so I called paypal and they told me that there's a chance they won't refund me the money because I didn't use signature confirmation. Paypal told me that I can add signature confirmation by calling USPS, but it's not possible.

Ebay,"Buyer filed paypal claim to return item, his return was not delivered to me. Case being reviewed?","I sold a pair of brand new shoes to the buyer and he claimed they were used. This was extremely frustrating and I thought the buyer was trying to scam me. He opened a dispute and escalated it to a claim. I agreed to accept the shoes back and then I would issue a refund. He shipped the shoes apparently but I have never received them and the tracking information has said ""Delivery Status Not Updated"" for 2 weeks now. I have a good feeling they were lost. The case has been under review for quite a while now, I am assuming perhaps a paypal specialist isn't sure what to do?

My question is, paypal won't hold me responsible for a refund at this point right? I think this might be USPS's fault now, but I haven't received my item back so I can't be expected to refund (therefore losing both the item AND my payment from the buyer). At the same time, I think the buyer was being honest and returning the shoes, so will he receive any type of compensation or is he going to be screwed here? In a situation like this, would paypal cover the refund amount themselves, or do they never spend their own money to resolve cases? What is the most likely scenario at this point. Will my money be taken by paypal and sent as a refund to the buyer still by any chance (which better not happen!), and if not, will the buyer still receive a refund or he gets the short stick?

One easy way to spend money is buying stuff on amazon that I immediately resell (or more correctly sell things that I immediately buy) such as amazon gift cards.

Ebay,After 75 days buyer got $$ back,"I sold a digital camera on ebay.  45 days after the transaction the buyer opened a SNAD case on ebay.  Never once contacted me with a problem in the time in between.  On exactly day 45 after they paid, they opened a case at 10pm.

In the case they wrote that the camera arrived damaged because of poor packing.  Right away I knew this must be someone trying to pull a fast one, because I packaged the digital camera in the original retail box, and put that box inside one of those large priority mail boxes that measure 12x12x8 and filled it with packing peanuts.  You could throw that off a roof, and with all the protection inside the camera would be untouched.

I've been selling on ebay for a while now and know that ebay never lets the seller win a Significantly Not As Described case, so I responded to the case the same day they opened the case, literally a less than an hour after they opened the case.  Theres an option that the seller can choose that says return the item for a full refund, so clicked I on that.  I also wrote a response that asked them to provide me with a tracking number when they return it, so I can know when to expect it to arrive.

OK so fast-forward now to this morning.

The case was opened for 30 days exactly.  No response from the buyer since opening the case 30 days ago.  They have not sent the item back.  

Well this morning I wake up to an email saying the buyer has escalated the case and it is under review by ebay.  Now just before writing this, I get a second message saying that ebay has closed the case in the buyers favor and has refunded the buyer and this case will count against my selling performance.

So to recap.  Buyer never emails me.  45 days after paying the buyer opens a SNAD case.  I agree to refund after buyer returns item.  A buyer has 30 days after opening a SNAD case to escalate it to ebay review.  On the 30th day the buyer escalated the case and ebay sides with buyer, and refunds buyer and buyer keeps item.

Grand total of 75 days after paying buyer gets a refund and gets to keep item.

The buyer's description said simply ""works great, adult owned, smoke free house."" It works, sure, but I am really bothered that I was not told about the damaged case and am looking to potentially return it. The item's page said no returns, so I would most likely have to contact ebay about it.

Your thoughts on the situation? I haven't contacted the seller or ebay about it yet.

edit: some extra info on why I bought the item without pictures or a detailed description. The buyer had 148 positive feedback with 98.8% positive. I thought at that point, ebay sellers knew exactly what they were selling and would not be misleading. If it were an inexperienced seller, I might understand this, but I just don't feel like I was being told everything about the product that I should have been told.

edit 2: Well now I feel really stupid.

Instead, there's a card with a code on it that I redeem to download the DLC, and the code's already been used! I wasted my goddamn money and I had no idea that there was a code that had to be redeemed. All I knew was that the premium edition had the DLC, but no one told me that it could be purchased new.
