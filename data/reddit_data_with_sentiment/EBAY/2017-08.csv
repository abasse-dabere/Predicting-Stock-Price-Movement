Ebay,Buyer attempting chargeback after two months for $700+ item,"This happens every couple of months and I'm sure every seller has been through this.

Pricey item, (in our case $700), bought on eBay, paid with PayPal, shipped to confirmed address according to tracking info; received by buyer, now trying a chargeback with credit card for unauthorized transaction.

This is the risk of doing business online. My only complaint is why is Paypal holding funds from us, the seller.  This claim isn't that the wrong item was received or that the item received was damaged or defective or not received at all.  The buyer never contacted us at all. The claim is unauthorized transaction.  What does the seller have to do with that? We no ability to authorize anything.

Thanks for listening.  Also, any tips for our response to Paypal will be appreciated.  Maybe our response to Paypal could be a little better. We're polite, stick to the fact and send a screenshot of proof of delivery.",22,16,2017-08-01,EBAY,0.057689912617206573,0.9160528182983398,0.026257269084453583
Ebay,MC011 Your eBay selling account has been restricted,Ebay is asking me to provide invoices for items that I've sold recently.

Ebay,"Buyer said she didn't get her item even though it was shown as ""delivered"" 4 days ago.","Maybe this is a newbie issue, but I'm a newbie and could use some outside opinions. 

I sent an item that cost about $30 including shipping to a buyer and the tracking lists it as ""delivered."" Last night, four days after it was shown as officially ""delivered,"" she messaged me asking me where her item was, saying she had been out of town for the week and did not find it in her mailbox along with some other items she had ordered upon returning. The item was fairly large, shoebox size, and I asked her if perhaps it would not fit inside her mailbox, especially if there were other items inside of it. 

She has yet to respond, but I suspect the item may have been left at her front step since it probably wouldn't have fit in her mailbox, especially if other stuff had been inside of it. She lives in an apartment complex, so I think there is a real possibility that a neighbor just snatched it up during the time that she was gone and that now it's lost forever. I told her I would try calling her local post office today to see if I could find out what they've done with it, if perhaps it went to the wrong address or was forgotten about or was kept to deliver later since her mailbox was full, but she also has yet to respond to that message.

In the event that mail is lost or stolen, do you guys reimburse the buyer? I am pretty unwilling to do this as I don't want to be out both the money and the item, and since the item is listed as ""delivered"" I know that eBay will rule in my favor. And although she has been pretty amicable so far and seems like a reputable buyer, I also haven't ruled out the possibility that she did actually get the item and is just trying to scam me, so I feel extra wary about coughing up money.

Either way I figure I'll just have to suck it up and take negative feedback. Ugh. What would you guys do in this situation?",11,4,2017-08-01,EBAY,0.05070227012038231,0.910927951335907,0.0383697971701622

Why didn't eBay charge him the actual shipping cost?

Will I be penalized for cancelling the sale? Will PayPal penalize?

Ebay,Ebay says I owe them $622 from 2013?,"This may not be the right subreddit for this question, so please feel free to guide me elsewhere.
I sold an iPhone on eBay back in 2013. I was naive and in high school and trusted a buyer who told me to ship the item to an address in Russia even though his account was based in the US. To make a long story short I sent the item without insurance and the owner of the account claimed he never received it. eBay sided with him and reimbursed him his money. I fought the reimbursement and provided eBay confirmation from Canada Post that I did indeed send the item and that Canada Post did hand the item off to Russian Post. The case seemed resolved since I never heard from eBay again and had no issue using my eBay account to buy and sell items for the last four years. The all of a sudden yesterday, a message appeared on my account claiming I owed eBay $622 for this closed case.
Am I obligated to pay this amount after all this time? Is there a statue of limitations on debt of this nature? Since I live in Ontario, Canada would it fall under Ontario's statute or under the state of California (since I believe that is where eBay is located)?

Hello Violator,

We noticed that you are not an authorized online retailer for FRISBY brand products and you have listed this particular item, which is sold exclusively by Comsis Computer.

As you may be aware, the unauthorized selling of FRISBY products is an illegal action that seriously infringes Trademark Laws of the United States. As the Trademark owner, we did not sell you, nor authorize you to sell any FRISBY branded products. While doing so you are violating USPTO laws and Ebay's policy against IP infringement.

We kindly request that you follow our instructions:
a) Remove all FRISBY product listed on ebay.com within 24 hours, and do not list FRISBY products without approval in the future.

If you don’t comply with these demands, we'll have no choice but to file an official claim with the ebay.com VeRO Program. We may also take legal actions against you and your company for Trademark Infringement on our products.

Sincerely,

Legal Department

Ebay,Royal Mail question regarding an undelivered and returned ebay item,"My buyer paid for the item (a PS4 game) on 30/06/17. I posted it the next day using Royal Mail Signed-For and added the tracking number to the transaction. He wasn't in when it arrived on 03/07/17 and it stayed at his local post office. He filed a claim with ebay because the item hadn't arrived, about two weeks later. I told him what I saw on the tracking page and told him where it was. No response. He had an opportunity until about 19/07 to collect it (a few days after that message), that's when they sent it to the Nation Returns Centre in Belfast (arrived on 23/07) and was marked as ""returned to sender"" on the RM tracking page. I've told him he'll get a refund once I get the game back. Here's the issue...

I always put a return address on my parcels apart from this one darn time. So the game will be at the NRC until 23/08. I've asked RM both over the phone and on a Livechat session if it's possible to get the item back using only the tracking information. Over the phone, I was told that I would be able to and I just needed to fill out a form, on livechat I was told which form (p58) but that I could only claim compensation and I would not get the item back. Even then, I've lost the postage receipt for that item, despite having the other receipts for the two other items I posted that day (typical) and Livechat told me I could not get a reprint as they won't keep a record of the transaction, which seems a bit weird.

It's only a £15 game but I'm annoyed at myself for not adding a return address but more annoyed at the buyer for not once contacting me before opening the claim and obviously not checking the tracking number and collecting the item/arranging a redelivery. Am I doomed? Or was the person over the phone at RM correct and there's a way to get the game back to me?

Ebay,Should I go ahead and file a claim?,"This is going to be long, so I'm sorry for that in advance.

I won the bid for an item on July 14th and attempted to pay that day, but received an error message stating that the seller wasn't receiving payments at the time and to contact them. I attempted to contact them with no response over the weekend, and waited until the end of Monday in case the seller was away for the weekend. I called eBay to request the seller's contact information, and texted, called, left a voicemail, and found the seller's Facebook and messaged them trying to contact them (not all at once, but after I received no response with one method, I tried another). It took a total of six days to hear anything back, and the seller claimed that they were sick and not checking their updates, and immediately fixed the PayPal issue. I paid on July 20th when the PayPal issue was fixed. They messaged me the very next day stating that the item was to be shipped that very day.

My item was supposed to arrive by July 29th with expedited shipping, and I still hadn't received it yesterday (August 1st), so I texted her asking for a tracking number, since eBay stated that the item was ""paid, but not shipped"", but I thought that maybe the seller forgot to mark it as shipped, since they are a new seller. I was told today by the seller that they noticed something wrong with the item and sent it to be fixed, and just received it today. I found this odd because the listing had pictures from every angle, in which the seller would have had to have noticed if something was truly wrong with the part they said needed to be fixed, and somehow they only noticed it when they were packing it into a box (the part that supposedly needed to be fixed was something you would have to actually examine the item for as well). They said that they had sent me a message about it through eBay, but that I must have not received it because the eBay app doesn't work well on their phone. I found this odd since the other eBay messages came through clearly. I asked for a tracking number again, to which I've had no response since.

Earlier this morning, I sent a text stating that if the item wasn't shipped and I wasn't provided with a tracking number by the end of the day, that I would be canceling my purchase and that the seller could keep the item. At 9:00 p.m. tonight (7:00 p.m. the seller's time, and also 10 hours after I had sent my text stating that I would be canceling if it wasn't shipped and the tracking number wasn't provided by the end of the day, so plenty of time), I was in the process of canceling and had just left a negative review stating that the seller had very poor communication and did not ship the item as promised, twice, when I got a message stating that the item had just shipped. I found this incredibly odd and contacted eBay about it. I am VERY tired of waiting for an item that I won the bid on nearly a month ago and I feel that this seller is either irresponsible, a very bad procrastinator, or is trying to scam me. If the item really did ship, I don't want to cancel now and seem like I am trying to get a free item, but at the same time I am tired of having my time wasted and do not want to have an empty box show up to my doorstep or continue to play these games. I have only bought about three or four other things on eBay before and therefore am not too terribly experienced with it (and I'm also a young adult new to dealing with things like this), and this is the only negative experience I've had. I've definitely learned my lesson about sellers that don't bother contacting their buyers back for nearly a full week, I should've expected this. This seller has been very hard to keep in contact with and I've still never heard back since she promised the item would be shipped yesterday. I am wondering whether or not I should wait to see if the item arrives or not or if I should go ahead and file a claim. I am NOT trying to get a free item, I am trying to be rid of this headache and get it settled. If the item does arrive, I will do what I can to reverse the negative feedback. I have been trying to remain professional and civil throughout this entire ordeal, but am rapidly losing my patience now.

This item cost over $300 including shipping, if that matters.

Everyone on this [thread](https://community.ebay.com/t5/Member-To-Member-Support/Received-an-item-from-Mr-Yuan/qaq-p/25882730) has received something(s), too, but there are no answers as to why... 

Could this be scam (sounds like it...) ?",14,11,2017-08-04,EBAY,0.0662330687046051,0.9028330445289612,0.03093387931585312
Ebay,eBay removed my listing for trademark violation and I was already paid by the buyer,"Do I refund the money back? I don't want get scammed? I haven't sent out the item yet. Not sure what to do.

I don't get why the listing was removed after it was already paid for lol. The guy is probably trying to scam me since I didn't realize you couldn't sell replicas on eBay and I notated that in the comments.",12,9,2017-08-04,EBAY,0.19388450682163239,0.7787982225418091,0.027317233383655548
Ebay,Who will win this case? Is there anything I can do at this point?,"Ok it starts off with me making a reasonable offer on a Marvel Legends build a figure that was missing the legs which is fine i have the legs. If you aren't familiar, they're action figures you build yourself by getting each piece separate (legs, arms, head etc). He made a count offer for $20 down from $22. $7 shipping. Apparently having an offer offended him. Anyway it took him five days to ship so I was rightfully mad and emailed him ""it took you five days to ship??""

He wrote back ""Yea it did!! What's your problem! I got it shipped as fast as possible I have a life and a full time job ! I don't appreciate you asking like that!"" And ""Why are you even complaining I dropped 2 dollars off the original price for you and you still want to complain!????"" And ""No need to be rude Brian!!"" All separate emails. 
This guy already had negative feedback for being rude. 

I told him yes don't sell something if you aren't going to ship in a timely manner. He wrote back ""Ha ok Brianna!!!! Your getting your TOY within the estimated time!!""


I finally get the package and guess what? It's missing pieces. I start a return case and he writes to eBay
 ""You are ridiculous. Several Missing pieces? One missing piece and that is an accident. I don't need a random piece to a random figure and I definitely didn't need to deal with a jerk like you. You hassled me for this item at a discount to begin with. You were insulting with your offers and are impossible to please. YouALSO received youritem within the estimated delivery time so you are a liar. I hope you have a great life crying about bullshit and scamming independent businesses, Brian. Give me my damn Figure and keep your money.

I left him negative feedback. He then left me positive feedback with a comment that said something like I was a thief and liar. I called eBay and they had the comment removed. I let him know. He wrote back ""In the future try not to be a prick and an entitled jerk! The world owes you nothing brian!!"" I sent him back the parts he sent me. 

Today he received the return aaand I got an email saying he asked eBay to step in with this note: ""I have received ONLY THE HEAD! I SOLD what was shown in the photos of my listing and I received only the head back!! I included a photo. The head was loose in a very large box with only the packing slip shown in the picture. The buyer, in messages confirmed that there was only a back piece missing! I have the missing back piece, it was an accident that it didn t get shipped. I told him I d ship it immediately but he wanted a refund. Now he has shipped me only THE HEAD! Please help""


So do I have any recourse or will eBay believe him?",14,9,2017-08-04,EBAY,0.09148945659399033,0.8798214197158813,0.028689110651612282

Ebay,Need Help With Listing Items With GSP Please!,"So, I understand how the GSP works. The problem is, I don't know what options in the actual listing are relevant to listing with GSP. Obviously I select the ""Sell internationally with the Global Shipping Program"", is this all I do? Is the method of shipping (i.e priority, first class etc.) determined by the domestic shipping method?

I figure the ""Other Shipping Options"" is for additional international 
shipping methods, so this I won't need to worry about unless I want separate options for a specific region? 

Also, I'm currently shipping with flat rate shipping until my scale arrives, so both weight and package dimensions aren't added to the listing. Is this a problem? I figure the price of shipping an item internationally is determined by weight, or is it a flat cost dependent on the region and/or shipping method?

Ebay,"Bought a printer from eBay didn't come with power lead, am I owed one?","I bought a printer from eBay but the seller didn't seem to think it was necessary to not only NOT include a power cable but also not mention it in the listing.

The Messages i've sent and the sellers replies.

Me: Hi there, printer arrived safely. Power cable did not :(

Seller: I beg your pardon?! What cable?

Me: The power cable that allows the printer to receive electricity.

Seller: I'm totally confused, have no idea what you're talking about. Regards.

Me: The package I received had the printer in it but the power cable was not in there. There is no power lead.

Seller: Why should it be included?! Dit it say anywhere that cables or anything else are included? Nope. Why did you assume that it was included, then? Very confusing... It is a used printer after all, isn t it. Regards

Am I owed a power lead or am I out of my mind?

Thanks guys.


Edit:

I thought I'd include the listing text also. As you can see, technically did not say power cable was included.

Ebay,First time eBay buyer: Item came broken + What to do?,"Hello, all! This is my first order ever on eBay. And needless to say, I am less than enthusiastic. In fact, I am pissed off. My order of a violin came later than expected and came broken. I paid 27.47 (w/TAX)  I went to all the shipping companies that the package was handled by and apparently because it's a FedEx smart post package I can't file a claim? I don't really care about going through the hassle of returning the broken item. (Does it matter if I do?) I just really want my full refund. In the occasion, the seller refuses to give me a refund which I fear may happen (due to certain select negative reviews as opposed to their general overall positive reputation) am I screwed? By the way, the seller's username was Mulchoice and he/she is based out of Hong Kong. Any suggestions about what to do regarding contacting the shipping companies that a noob like me may not have known?

Ebay,Paypal Overrules Ebay in Case Outcome,"Just had a buyer attempt to return a functioning graphics card as the 30 day window was about to expire as being broken because she was experiencing driver issues.

I provided paypal with my entire interaction with the seller and outcome of the Ebay case. They decided to award the buyer a full refund, despite Ebay ruling against it. My question is what is even the point of an Ebay case if it gets overruled by paypal? I spent a lot of time responding and dealing with this case, yet end up getting shafted.

Ebay,Advise on a scam seller that demands I revoke my negative feedback.,"Brief summary of events:

*    I got careless/gullible/stupid and bought a $10 free shipping item from a 100% blue star Feedback seller selling Splatoon figurines and not much else on their profile aside from Breath of the Wild ""amiibos"".

*    Pictures of item were just generic store stock images and a bare bones description of the list of available figurines.

*    A week later, I receive an envelope in the mail that contained two blank plastic cards with the names of the two figurines I ordered sharpied on them. (At this time, I did not know these contained the data of the figurines... but I just wanted the figurines.)

*    Item desc still up and has now been edited to say ""these are not figurines"". But doesn't say they are cards - obviously.

*    Immediately went to ebay and sent negative feedback and demanded a return. Seller refunded money within minutes.

*    Few days later, got a message from them demanding I revoke my feedback, because he ""resolved my issue"" and ""not demanding a return of your cards"". Then a possible vague threat of negative buyer feedback.

*    Day later, got a ""Seller is requesting feedback revision"" email with them saying:

    ""Reason for request: The seller was able to resolve a problem you had with this transaction. Message from the seller: I have already given you your refund, and you've kept your cards. I have done everything to resolve this.""

* Okay... the rabbit hole goes deeper. What I found out AFTER declining to change feedback is the item is technically accurate...sort of. What the seller is selling are bootlegs of the data on Amiibo figurines in card form. Definitely don't want that and I'm pretty sure sending bootlegged items through the mail is illegal, so I hope they don't demand a return.

Should I just keep the negative feedback as is and move on? Or could the seller demand I send their cards back and/or send me negative buyer feedback?

Of course I say no, refund his payment and tell him to update his address and pay again. 

Now he's messaged me 3 times saying he can't figure out how to pay even though I sent a new invoice, told him to check in his computer (not his phone) and said he can of course pay directly through paypal. Nothing for 3 days now.

So assuming another week goes by and he never pays, is there a way to cancel the sale and get my fees back? I cannot open a new ""unpaid item"" but if I ""cancel the sale"" he has to agree for me to get the fees credited, right? What happens if I cancel as ""buyer requested"" and he never responds?

Ebay,How to get anything for free on eBay!,"Obviously the title of the post is sarcasm.... if you were wondering.

I have sold a pair of sunglasses to a US buyer who then claimed they did not suit him and opened a return request.

I have then received a box back from the buyer which contained a piece of dirty old rag. There was no sunglasses inside.

The best part is that the idiot actually sent me a photo of the USPS receipt after he posted the box to me. This receipt has the parcel weight on it.

The weight on the receipt reads 5.6oz which is 159 grams.

The sunglasses and their manufacturers packaging and accessories alone weigh 220 grams.

Therefore a cardboard box containing them cannot weight 159 grams.... it would weigh 159 + 220 = 379 grams.

This is eBays reply to my appeal against a refund he requested on grounds of fraud. I have also supplied all evidence of this in a long letter to eBay and this is the response I got:

http://imgur.com/a/Lj8f4

Conclusion.

There is no need to pay for anything on eBay. Just buy anything you want. Then ask to return it, instead return an empty box. Dont even bother about making sure it is the same weight as nobody cares. You will get a refund 100% guaranteed.

P.S.

I noticed this person occasionally sells items on eBay. I will be sure to buy something from him in the future and then claim it is not as described so I can return him the same old dirty rag and keep his stuff for free.

Ebay,Help: Return Request,"I'm new to being an eBay seller and have only sold a couple of things so far. I sold an item and after a week the buyer wants to return it because it ""arrived damaged"", from their description it sounds more like they've been too heavy handed and have broken it in the week they've had it.

I sent them a message basically saying it wasn't sent damaged and it sounds more like it was damaged in their time of owning it so I can't offer them a refund for something that didn't arrive damaged but what happens now? eBay says I have to resolve this within a week but how does this get resolved and what happens if me and the buyer don't agree?

Thanks in advance for any advice!

Update: in case anyone was wondering.

2 weeks of stress.
eBay initially ruled in the buyers favour (got told that this had to happen to let me appeal the case) and made them return the headphones to me, and once it had arrived they deducted the money from me. I complained through live chat and emails, got told by one department that they wouldn't let me appeal, complained on live chat, got told a specialised department could look into it and overrule the other department, complained again to this new department, got made to fill out a disclosure and gave evidence of the photo's from my original listing, a screenshot of when the headphones arrived to the buyer (signed for delivery), photos of the headphones now returned to me, a screenshot of the message from the buyer proving that they used it. And so finally, the decision was reversed and I got my money back. Not sure if this money came from eBay or the buyer though..

tl;dr 2 weeks of a lot of complaining on live chat and emails with eBay and shoving my evidence in their face got eBay to go in my favour.

Ebay,Follow-up: I figured out what triggers some customers to get overcharged for shipping,"Follow-up of my earlier post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/6r773h/my_customers_are_getting_overcharged_for_shipping/

Almost all of my sales transactions have been for Buy It Now at full price.  Those go through their checkout with the discounted shipping cost applied.

If a buyer makes an offer on a Buy It Now item or places a bid on an auction it displays a confirmation dialog with the offer, shipping, and other fees.  Instead of using the discounted rates as I specified in shipping preferences, it appears to be using the full retail shipping price.  The buyer is invoiced for whatever amount they committed to on the dialog, but that amount may differ from what was advertised on the listing.

Today I accepted an offer on a Buy It Now item, and noticed that the buyer was charged $22.06, while my cost was only $18.98.  http://imgur.com/K46AQM3

I clicked on my sold listing and entered their zip code.  The calculated freight amount was $18.97.   http://imgur.com/v5S2ZK5  In this case the freight had increased by $3.09.  Last week it increased by around $13 for two of my customers.  If they looked at the original listing after the fact it would be clear that they paid a lot more than what was advertised.  

I called eBay support again to share this information.  After going through this specific example with the CSR she put me on hold to discuss it with a supervisor.  Their conclusion was that the zip code or package weight differed from when the shipping quote was calculated.  Neither of those had changed.  She thanked me for the information and told me that she would pass it along to their technical staff to review.  Not holding my breath here.

At this point I'm tilting at windmills and it's time to move along.  I'm sharing this information so you can watch out for it as both a seller and a buyer.",4,11,2017-08-07,EBAY,0.03013662062585354,0.9284725189208984,0.04139088839292526

It just seems weird to me. Everything I've read about collection-only items was sellers being annoyed at buyers wanting to arrange their own courier because they felt there was a big chance of them being scammed because they (the seller) had no proof of delivery.

This isn't a high value comic, it was $5 and shipping was $10. However, I wanted what I saw in the photo, because I plan to spend another $30-$40 to frame and display it.

I checked back to the listing. I buy from mobile, and item description isn't at the forefront of the listing. The item description is generic, with many words. The seller obviously sets themselves up for generic sales. 

A note on item condition says ""photo is a stock image."" Is this allowed?

The description says that the listing photo is not of the actual item? The actual item may contain writing on the cover? They also say that they ship books in ""fine"" condition. The photo appears to me to be a book in a much better condition than ""fine"".

I am unhappy with my purchase, because I wanted a cover as nice as the one in the listing. I don't want to pay for return shipping. I don't want this book in this condition.

I sent them a message back saying I would just like the item as soon as possible, and if they could upgrade it to faster shipping, I would appreciate it.

The seller offers me ""ebay swag from the conference"" and a ""$25 ebay gift card"" that will be in my package. They also tell me they will be dropping it in the overnight slot that night.

4 days later, no package, no tracking. I'm sending a message every day. Finally, they respond and say ""Oh sorry we had to go get my son from summer camp, it is 90 minutes away."" I respond that I just want my item, the overnight shipping, and the gift card that was offered. 

They finally drop the package off and it gets there the next day. Great! 2 weeks after ordering, and a week after the expected delivery date, I have my package. But no gift card. 

Immediately after getting my package, I get an email from Ebay saying they closed my open request because it says the package was delivered, and my negative feedback was removed. 

Now when I message the seller, asking about the gift card, they keep saying ""Oh let me think about it, I'll get back to you."" And then of course they never do.

So, is there anything I can do about this?

TL;DR version: Seller offered me a gift card and overnight shipping for a package that was a week late due to them forgetting to send it. Seller sent item, but not the gift card that was offered in a message sent to me.",8,7,2017-08-11,EBAY,0.027768872678279877,0.9131408929824829,0.05909019708633423
Ebay,"What is the best software for listing our inventory for sale simultaneously on multiple websites (eBay, Shopify, Amazon, Swappa, etc)","My business partner and I buy and flip used electronics (laptops, phones, etc). Primarily, we sell our inventory on eBay and our Shopify store. Basically, we need software that will allow us to list each item on multiple websites like eBay, Shopify, Amazon and Wal-Mart. If it sells on 1 site, it would need to be removed from the others.
We've been using ecomdash and it's... meh. If an iPhone sells on eBay, it correctly lists it as ""sold out"" on our Shopify store, but the opposite is not true. If it sells on Shopify, it is not removed from eBay... meaning we have run into the awkward situation where we sell a single item twice.
Can anyone recommend an afforable solution? Ecomdash is $50-$100/month and we'd be willing to go higher if the quality was there.

Ebay,Any chance of ever having a selling restriction removed? (Need help),"I'm a long time eBay seller (7+ years), hundreds of positive feedback (flawless), 0 complaints/returns, always paid my seller fees on time, never broke any rules or had any issues. I sell a whole range of different items, from electronics to household stuff.

Recently, I received a warning for selling gift cards (it was for selling digital goods). A lot of people asked me to scratch the code and email it before shipping, which I happily do. Never had a problem, but ebay still sent a warning. I corrected this and stopped emailing codes before shipping, but this wasn't good enough for eBay, who sent me another warning along with a permanent selling ban out of nowhere. I can still buy goods on eBay, but not sell anymore.

I tried emailing support, calling them, explaining the situation, etc to no avail. Just a stock response that selling restrictions aren't removed. I'm just frustrated that ebay would toss away a 7+ year trusted seller (they've made a small fortune in seller fees from me, which I always paid on time), just over a few gift cards.

Is there any avenue I can turn to?

International Site Visibility removed from your eBay listing

Hello ..........................

You recently created or revised this eBay listing that included the International Site Visibility feature:

......................................................

......................................................

However, we had to remove International Site Visibility from your listing. Of course, we won't be charging you the fee for International Site Visibility.

Because the laws and eBay policies vary by country, sometimes items that can be listed in your country can't be listed internationally. It's also possible that the listing itself wasn't following an eBay policy in another country. In situations like this, we automatically remove the International Site Visibility feature from the listing.

To find out about our requirements for international site visibility, visit:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/questions/sell_international_requirements.html

Ebay,Got scammed. Kinda new to this. What action do I take?,"Hi. Thanks for opening.

**TLDR**: Bought item for price that was too good to be true. Looked suspicious when delivered, and the 'new' item was used with cheap tape over it. I open it, and stuff is missing from this 'new' item. What action do I take?

I saw an item on ebay last Sunday, it was a power rangers toy that is quite hard to find. Sells for about 300ish new. I see one from a two month old account user (who never sold anything) for 60 """"""""brand new"""""""" and I quickly buy it. They quickly message me saying they will ship it on Wednesday and I say ok. On Tuesday, they said they will have to do Friday because of work. They mark it as shipped and I got it today. 

I opened the box and it smelled suspicious. I noticed cheap extra tape was put over the top opening and the bottom one was normal. I knew this was too good to be true. I am a (New in box) toy collector, but I opened this because it looked fishy, and I was correct. The toy sword and two little pieces of the item are missing. Never opened, but stuff is missing? lol.

I took pics of the ""sealed"" box beforehand where it looks like tape was put over it to make it look sealed. Another thing is that I already have a sealed one of this exact item that I bought recently so I compared the boxes. Flaws were hidden from the pics.

It's only $60 and I wouldn't care about taking this L. I have one of these already. Because of the price. I took the risk. I was hoping to have two.

How do I go about this? I don't get scammed too often. First time 'scammed' on ebay. Suspicious account and looks like they could just ditch the account. Do I open a case immediately and see what happens? Message them?",4,3,2017-08-12,EBAY,0.05483836308121681,0.9095059633255005,0.03565572574734688

Ebay,Buyer Lying and making false Claims to get refund and steal my item.,So i sold my first item on eBay about a week and it has been a stress filled disaster. If i win this case or not im 100% finished with ebay. So my mom bought a laptop she did not want so she sent it to me. I did not need it so i decided to sell it on ebay. The only time i used it was to make sure it worked and to install windows 10 on it there were no damages and the laptop was 100% new. I took pictures for my listing and proved that the laptop was in perfect working condition. A buyer bought it 2 days later without asking me any questions about it.. which i thought was suspicious. Regardless i packaged it up safe and shipped it out. After about 48 hours he filed for a refund and return because he said the laptop had scratches and performance issues. I checked the tracking number and it said the item was in transit to his location and had not arrived yet. So i immediately called about to call him out on his lies. About 8 hours later he got the laptop. Then he sent pictures where he put scratches on it purposely and then put stuff like old hairs and dandruff on the keyboard it was disgusting. Before i sent the item i had pictures showing excellent condition and clean keyboard. I also called eBay and informed them that i think he is making false photos. Seems as if they were taking my side.  I reported him to ebay also to paypal and im awaiting a response. I will fight this to the end. I also had a no return policy on my listing if that even matters. I have read things online that the buyer always wins. If i lose this case i will feel 100% cheated that the ebay system is broken and that he basically stole my laptop. But i will continue fighting,23,14,2017-08-16,EBAY,0.07478097081184387,0.8974087238311768,0.027810288593173027
Ebay,"Buyer claimed item not delivered, when I gave them tracking number showing it was delivered they demand partial refund - what to do?","Ask described in title. I sold an old iPod nano, it had a few very minor nicks on the corners but nothing big. Pics in my posting were super clear and I said it was ""used."" Buyer paid right when auction finished, I shipped it but never gave them the tracking number. About 10 days later (yesterday) they submit a refund request claiming they did not receive the item. Then I update them and the listing with the tracking information that shows it's received. They closed that request and sent me a message saying it has a scratch on the screen and dings so they'll keep it if I give them a partial refund of $10. (item sold for $40)

In looking around I see different suggestions of what to do. It feels to me like this person is just trying to scam me out of some money, especially because they claimed they never received it and then closed that request once I provided evidence it was delivered. Should I respond to the message they sent me telling them I don't believe them, should I ignore them, should I report them for abusing the return policy by falsely claiming they didn't receive the item?

Ebay,Slightly Different Twist On The Returning Empty Box 'Gag',"Hi All,

First time this has happened. Item arrived with buyer, all cool. But 3 weeks later they say its no broke (how it broke, lord knows). But, our first argument is ""Theres no warranty, eBay doesnt cover you for 'x' weeks/months"". So not sure what to do.

In the space of that conversation, they open a return case and eBay takes over - you **must** return it. You will then **100%** be given a refund (and they take the funds and put them on hold in your PayPal ready - which sucks).

Now, they've said theyve returned it and provided a tracking number to the case.

When you click it, it does indeed say its been delivered, but it was delivered by ""Leicester"" post office (I live *miles* away from Leicester, so there is zero chance this would be where they'd deliver it from). Plus, its signed by a different persons name - and it doesnt say it was delivered to neighbour.

Here's the rub... Ive now escalated and done everything I can, but when speaking (telephone) to eBay, they are **adamant** the case is done. ""I can see they have returned it, so the funds will be released"". They're literally repeating it like a really rubbish call script.

No matter how much I explain that they've just sent a package to a mate (probably) in Leicester, and used the reference number to fool the system.

It cant be *that* easy can it!?

Its hundreds of pounds too!

Ebay,"Buyer will not return item, not for one and half month","So basically a buyer opened up a return request under the reason ""item does not match description/photo"". I asked him to describe what was wrong with the item, he never responded. I think he just had buyer remorse and because I have a no return policy, he just lied so that he could return.

So I offered him a partial refund on eBay, guess what, he did not accept nor deny it.

This makes me in a tricky situation. According to eBay, the buyer has over 40 days to respond to my partial refund offer, which would be the end of September.

This is beyond ridiculous. The buyer is obviously going to keep using the item until the end of next month, and then deny the partial refund request, and then return it to me. 

The item is a kitchen item. So by using it for free for one and half months, the condition is likely to deteriorate, greatly reducing the resale value.

I sent message to the buyer asking him to make a decision and start the return process, but he's totally ignoring any of it. 

Now what is my option? I don't even think eBay would help me given how stupid their customer support is. The whole system is heavily flawed and the buyer is taking advantage of that to use item for free for months.",16,3,2017-08-17,EBAY,0.0580701008439064,0.8984499573707581,0.04347994923591614

Ebay,"Dear Ebay Buyers,","Sellers are people too.  We have families, lives, errands to run, other things to do.  Some of us have other jobs as well.  We do this to make money to help our families.  Most of us are not trying to lie, cheat, and steal.  We are just honestly trying to make some money off of you.  That is our motive!! If I have a thousand positive feedback at 100%, I'm likely not playing the long con to start selling counterfeits to you.

Please, for the love of god, stop wasting our time.  Don't ask intricately annoying questions if you have no intention on buying.  I don't feel like measuring the length and width and gram weight of the item in sunlight on a Wednesday.  No, I don't know if the black or white one will make your ass look fatter.  Also, no I don't have a model available to take pictures of in your size to stand in a blue room, sorry!  I do have a really long return policy though! 
 
Don't make offers just to see if we are willing to take them and then not pay them.  Don't tease us and don't wait until the last second for returns.  We do not like renting our inventory.  Please don't say anything from behind a screen that you wouldn't have the nerve to say to our faces.  Finally, we take time to write our listings and take our pictures.  Please actually look at them and read them before asking us information that's in them.

Thanks.

Ebay,How you can Protect Yoself as a seller,"Hello!

Lots of questions on this sub have to do with scammers and how to avoid them, so I figured I’d write something up to help out. 

First thing is buyer requirements. Limiting the bad folks’ ability to buy from you is important. 

You get to buyer requirements by clicking on the “Hi Yourname” link in the upper left hand corner of the website, clicking on “Account Settings,” and going to “Site Preferences” under “My eBay Views” on the lefthand side.  

(or click here [Buyer Requirements](http://offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?BuyerBlockPreferences)

The buyer requirements are as follows: 

**Block buyers without a PayPal account.** (Check this)

Most scammers aren’t going to link a PayPal account to their eBay account because it makes them harder to track. Checking this one will eliminate pretty much all of the scammers who’ve created their account today and have 0 feedback. New buyers who want your stuff will link their PayPal account, scammers won’t. 

**Buyers with Unpaid Item Strikes.** (Check this)

You can block buyers who have a problem paying. You can set this up to be pretty restrictive: 2 in 12 months, or lax, 5 in 1 month. I personally opt for more restrictive. Once a buyer commits to pay, you can’t open an Unpaid Item case against them for two days and can’t close it with a strike for four after that. That’s 6 days from the time they decided to buy. Once you open the case, eBay sends messages to the buyer reminding them that payment is a good thing and that they should probably do that. If they haven’t paid by the time a seller can close a case against them, well.. that’s a problem. 

Beyond that, buyers can appeal Unpaid Item Strikes for a couple of reasons, and sellers can forgive the buyer’s non-payment by asking eBay to remove the strike. So if a buyer has a couple of legitimate strikes on their account… why bother?

**Block buyers in locations to which I don’t ship** (Check this)

This one should just be checked. If you set up shipping location exclusions in the shipping preferences, this is how they’re activate. If you don’t, buyers in those locations can still attempt to buy, but they won’t be able to pay until you invoice them for shipping. This works really well with the Global shipping program – just select all of the boxes in the international locations part of the shipping location exclusions and override for GSP. Only buyers who are in GSP eligible countries (both covered by the program and areas where the item can be shipped) will be able to buy your stuff. 

**Buyers with policy violation reports **(Check this)

Most sellers don’t take the time to report buyers, which is a shame, because that’s how buyers are kicked off of the site. Setting this one up is basically saying “hey, you’ve pissed off someone so much that they took the time to tell someone about it, I don’t want to deal with you. The most restrictive is 4 in 6 months, the least is 7 in 1 month. 

**Buyers with a negative feedback score:** (Check this)

Buyers can’t get negative feedback, so they have to be sketchy sellers to be impacted by this filter. They have to have so much negative selling feedback that it overrides both the positives that they may have earned by selling and any feedback that they received by buying. -1 is the most restrictive and -3 is the least. (Any more than that and they go away.)

**Buyers who bid on several of my items and don’t pay. **

Ignore this one. Most people don’t need it. There’s some info on it linked in the description below the box. 

**Apply the settings to active and future listings:**  (Check this)

If you have an auction and you’ve got bidders before you enable this, those bidders aren’t impacted for those items, but will be for future items. 

**Don’t allow blocked buyers to contact me** (Check this)

This concerns new communications only – if there’s an existing transaction or communication thread, then they can still communicate with you through those for a time. That will expire, then they’re out of your hair forever. 

**Set up the Unpaid Item Assistant:**

Not getting paid sucks, and having to open a case and follow up with it sucks even more. Luckily there’s the Unpaid Item Assistant which automates this for you. Go into site preferences and take a look. 

You can set how long you want to give buyers to pay (between 2 and 32 days) and whether or not you want to automatically relist the item once the case is closed. (I don’t automatically relist – if there are any upgrades on the listing, you get billed for them when it lists, and I like to be able to make changes to a listing before I send it back up.)

You might be tempted to just cancel a transaction if a buyer is unresponsive and doesn’t pay – doing this is speedier, sure, but it also doesn’t tag the buyer with a strike and it lowers the effectiveness of your buyer requirements and it doesn’t block the buyer from leaving feedback.

**The next thing is to protect yourself from social engineering scams. **

**Your sold list shows you your payment status. If it’s got a black dollar sign, your payment is good. If it’s got an hourglass, it’s not there yet. For the hourglass, if you hover over it and it says that it’s processing, the buyer used an eCheck and you’ll have to wait a few days for it to clear. Don’t ship until it clears. If it say “Buyer marked as paid” you’re getting scammed. **

If you get an email that looks official and like it came from eBay, go to your eBay messages and verify that the sender is indeed eBay. Buyers might send a message that sounds like it came from PayPal saying that the payment has been processed and you can ship the item but you won’t be able to access the payment until it’s delivered. You won’t get an email like this from eBay or PayPal in your eBay messages box. 

If you’re a new seller, you have a hold on your funds while you’re building up your history with eBay – those funds will be released the earliest of the following:

* 21 days after the transaction
* 10 days after you marked as shipped
* 3 days after the tracking you provided shows delivered 

You can see your funds availability date in your sold list. 

**Always provide tracking.** If you don’t, and the buyer says that they didn’t get the item, you’ll lose every time unless they admit that the item was delivered before the case is closed. If you are selling super cheap items and tracking would cause you to take a loss, just realize that if they open a case, you might as well refund them voluntarily because if eBay steps in the buyer will probably win, get a refund, an you’ll get a defect. 

**If someone’s being sketchy and horrible – report them.** If they’ve purchased something from you, go into your sold list and click on “More Actions” next to the item. If they haven’t, call eBay and report them through Customer Service. Reporting is anonymous.

eBay will look into the buyer and take appropriate action. You’ll never hear about the results, so don’t’ ask, but reporting is important. If there’s a pattern of behavior on the part of the buyer, they might get kicked off of the site before you have to deal with them. 

You can set up “Best Offers” on fixed price listings. I love best offers because it lets buyers think they’re getting a good deal and they don’t take as long as an auction. If you’re going to use best offers, use the advanced form when you list.(it’s a link in the upper right of the basic listing form – once you go advanced, you can never go back – but the advanced form is better anyway. 

With best offers you can set a lower bound on the offers you’ll accept. Anything below that is automatically declined. This eliminates a bunch of screwy low-ball offers and saves you time. 

You can also set an amount above which you will always accept the offer. Don’t do this. If a scammer gives you 1 dollar more than your buy it now price, you now have to deal with them and it’s annoying. 

The really cool thing about best offers is that you can decline them or make a counter offer – it gives you significantly more control over what you’re actually going to get for the item you’re selling. Just be aware that the stuff in the comments section is binding, so if you accept an offer for free shipping and you’re selling a piano, you’re life is going to suck. 

Buyers can potentially ask you a question about your item by clicking a link in your listing. They may also make offers even if you haven’t enable them on your listing. If you want to accept the offer, click on the “Make Private Offer” button at the bottom of the email. If the buyer accepts – you’ve got a sale. 

Finally – if you have a problem, call eBay. Customer service is there to help you and provide you with the best course of action going forward. Calling is always better than asking eBay to step in online if you’re having a dispute. Escalation may not be in your best interest at that point. You may not have enough documentation to win. If you escalate a dispute into a case and lose, it puts a defect on your account and you lose out on your money. 

If a buyer’s being sketchy and you don’t know what to do – call. Don’t get into a fight with the buyer – you might say things that will hurt you in the long run. 
I know this is long, but once you go through the buyer requirements, you never have to touch them again and the other stuff is just some strategies that you can remember as you’re going along. Setting this stuff up early on will make your whole experience better.",21,29,2017-08-19,EBAY,0.07494864612817764,0.8945194780826569,0.030531845055520535

Ebay,International Buyer Received Item Damaged. Refuses to file an insurance claim,"I sold a pair of shoes to a buyer in Trinidad almost a month ago. She paid for Priority Mail International and I shipped her oder the same day she bought the item. She claims to have wanted this item in time for her birthday so she paid for Priority instead of First Class. Fast forward 15 days later she messaged me wondering why her package hasn't delivered yet. I called USPS and turns out the package was stuck in customs for days. Finally the item arrives and the shoes are scuffed up and the sole is separating. She sent me pictures and wants to return them. No way I'm paying high priced shipping to receive damaged merchandise. So I try to work with her to file an insurance claim for them. Buyer messages me back refusing to work with me saying her post office wouldn't believe her claims if she tried, now threatens to open a case if she doesn't get a refund.

Ebay,Did I screw up?,"Just sold an item at a VERY good rate for the customer. Included an additional battery AND a case. Included was one minor part (that are honestly easily lost, and I've lost one or two before - brand new it includes two). However, I forgot that the device brand new includes a (rather unnecessary) remote controller because I just haven't had mine in the three years I've owned one - long story as to why I don't have it.

I didn't say it was included in the posting, but I also didn't say it WASN'T included. I feel a little conflicted. The buyer got a few extras he wouldn't normally get. He's upset because I didn't give the controller, nor did he get extras of the minor part.

In my head, I'm like, ""Dude, I gave you extras I didn't have to, and the rate is at least $250 under what it would normally cost used."" But at the same time I'm like, hm. Maybe I should have included this.

If I BUY these items and send them to him, I'll make a lot less than I would (already had to pay $100 over what was estimated on shipping!!!) But I also don't want to screw a dude over.

I could care less about my rating. I'm not an active buyer/seller. Haven't sold anything since 2014, actually. But prior to that my ratings were fantastic.",6,4,2017-08-19,EBAY,0.05995409935712814,0.9044793248176575,0.035566527396440506

Ebay,Buyer has started a chargeback with their bank...,"and now paypal has put a hold on my funds, putting me in the negative as I had no previous balance. I sold a new 3dsXL to a new buyer thinking it would be alright since he paid immediately via paypal, which was verified before shipping my product out. Anyways, all is good until 6 weeks later when the buyer claims unauthorized/unrecognized transaction with their bank and now I have a dispute with paypal right now. I sent them my tracking info and the ebay invoice to help resolve the case. I guess my question is, how likely is it that I will win this case and have my money returned to my account? Also, how long does it take for them to come to a conclusion with these cases? Should I call them? 

I guess I should have seen this coming seeing as he was a new user, account created that same month he purchased it. He also didn't respond to a message I sent him shortly after he purchased my item regarding shipping details. He also used a company address. My fault and lesson learned. Might switch to craigslist as I have a few other 3ds and ps4 to sell.

Also, the buyer is requesting a refund for an amount higher than what he spent, like wtf is up with that? How is he even allowed to do that?",13,3,2017-08-19,EBAY,0.0402565561234951,0.9171942472457886,0.04254918172955513

Ebay,"Buyer bought an iPhone listed as ""As-Is, For parts or not working"", claimed it would not work and left negative feedback. How do I restore my 100% ?","An idiot customer purchased an iPhone 5S that was listed as ""As-Is, for parts or not working"", then claimed that it would not work. 

Then, this guy decides to open a PayPal dispute, which at my surprise, he lost. I'm surprised since PayPal is generally *heavily* biased towards buyers. 

So, the buyer lost the PayPal dispute, I gave PayPal all the proofs that I was not doing anything shady, only selling a phone FOR PARTS.

The iPhone was not even listed under ""Used"" at all, I wrote ""As-Is for parts or not working"" all over the description and I genuinely could not have made it any clearer. The buyer claims that parts were missing, but none were.

***[Buyer's Feedback here](http://i.imgur.com/wP9snkf.png)***

So after losing a dispute, the buyer was able to leave a negative feedback, which in my opinion, he should not have been able to leave a feedback at all considering the idiotic PayPal dispute that he lost.

Even ***I*** cannot leave a feedback whatsoever.

I have about 310 feedbacks and every single one of them has been 100% Positive *since 2011*.

I reported his feedback, but nothing has happened in two weeks. Is there anything that I could do ? I explained eBay in a text that took every character available. 

Is there a way to either delete his feedback or make it so it does not count ?

Ebay,"Seller threatened to ""pursue a theft complaint"" over returned item, not sure what to do","Hi there! I'll try to summarize this as quickly as possible.

I bought an electronic item recently off eBay for &lt;$25. When it arrived, the item did not turn on and was in much worse condition than described.

I filed a return with eBay due to the item not working, and when the seller did not respond for a few days I asked eBay to step in. They sent me a tracking label and I packed up the item and shipped it back to the seller. eBay has since refunded me the purchase amount.

The seller recently sent me a photo of the returned item, stating that there was an accessory missing from the returned item. He believes that I tried to scam him for this accessory (despite the accessory not being included in the original shipment). I have no idea where the accessory is, since I was more preoccupied with the item itself not working.

I've explained this to the seller, and he has threatened to ""pursue a theft complaint"". I'm not sure what this means, but I'd really like not to have to deal with the police showing up at my door or an IC3 report or anything like that. Hell, if I had the accessory I'd ship it back to him at my own cost, but I'm almost certain I didn't receive it.

Ebay,"[UPDATE] Buyer bought iPhone listed as ""For Parts or Not Working"" and left a negative feedback after losing PayPal dispute.","Good news ! 

I followed /u/Enferrari 's advice about calling eBay about my problem. It honestly went *ridiculously* smoothly !

I was on hold for less than 30 seconds and then was able to speak with a rep. Then after confirming my name and username, I was placed on hold for about a minute and then they came back saying that it is indeed against the rules to retaliate with a negative feedback when you lose a dispute. 

They removed the negative feedback and now I'm back to 100% Positive ! 

I am honestly shocked because I have been screwed over a few times by eBay just like everyone else, but that was a pleasant experience ! 

So now, I am just genuinely wondering why buyers are allowed to leave a negative feedback after PayPal deciding in my favor over a dispute.

_______________________________

TL;DR : Buyer bought broken phone listed as ""For parts or not working"", angrily opened a PayPal dispute about the phone not working even though it was written all over my listing. PayPal took my side. Seller left an angry negative feedback. Called eBay and after 3 minutes on the phone, negative feedback was removed.

GREAT SUCCESS !!

&gt; 
&gt; 1) What post office did they tell you they delivered it to? (because there are many in my city)
&gt; 
&gt; 2) What's the tracking number to confirm it was delivered to the post office?
&gt; 
&gt; 3) What's the shipping companies phone number so I can call them?
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you

Today they replied:

&gt; Feel sorry to hear that,my friend, I can understand your situation. As we checked ,it has delivered to your city, As a seller,I really hope you receive it very soon. But international trade has many uncontrollable factors. Maybe it is fast ,but sometimes it is also very slow, But pls don't worry about it.

LOL, like how the hell do they expect me not to see the bullshit of them telling me it's arrived in my city with no tracking...

Can I contact eBay and get their account banned or something for the blatant lying and flat out disrespect?

Interested in your thoughts about this.

Ebay,How to cancel a return request,"I sold a 250$ CPU on ebay a couple weeks ago right before I moved to another country as I was not going to take my desktop with me.
I suddenly get a phonecall from someone as soon as I get to my hotel after midnight from this person who somehow got my phone number because I didn't respond to his one message in those 14 hours the plane took.
I explained that his cpu was shipped the day before and I will get him his tracking once I am able to get it as I just had a fourteen hour flight and am a day ahead of him.
Fast forward to the next morning, I get a bunch of nasty emails from him in the middle of the night because I didn't get him that tracking number while I slept. Finally I get the tracking number and I see it was delivered.
I report this to ebay as I am worried the guy is trying to scam me and I get no reply.
A few days later I get now a refund request that the CPU did not come with a heatsink or fan. Except I said it would not come with one and I never got a fan when I bought this brand new.
I tried to give him 5$ to cover a fan since I hear ebay likes to always favor the buyer in these situations to cover the cost of a stock intel fan on ebay listed at about 5$ but he wants the full price and to ship it back to my old home.
I refused that and told him that it would be 5$ or he has to ship it back to my new home when I have an address to give him.

Few days later and our deadline is tomorrow but I have not heard a single reply back, so I called ebay to close the request and they told me I have to accept the refund in full. But now what guarantee do I have that this guy is not going to destroy the CPU? I have no way of testing it when I get it back so I can issue the refund. I have no motherboard to put it in and it can come back looking cosmetically fine, but infact it has been destroyed by being put in a microwave or soaked in water etc. 
They want me to approve the refund and then wait 30 days for a reply in which they will then close it.
What stops this guy from using it for 30 days in which it degrades in value and then sending it to me when he is done with it?
Am I doing something wrong about trying to get this closed and resolved?
I sure as hell will never use ebay again after this encounter. This was my first time selling and will be my last.",9,3,2017-08-21,EBAY,0.031556546688079834,0.9257226586341858,0.04272078722715378
Ebay,Advice on where to post an item,"Hey, so I'm new to this sub and to Reddit in general (been using Reddit for less than 30 days) I'm wondering where the best place to promote an eBay post would be.

Ebay,How Can I (Buyer) Cancel a Return Request?,"Long story short, on a recent order a seller accidentally shipped me the wrong color of an item (ink, so the color was the whole reason for the purchase), I opened a return request specifying that I preferred a exchange for the proper item, and the seller accepted.

The seller was supposed to wait until they recieved my return before shipping their replacement, I guess, but instead they shipped the replacement imediately (it took me a couple of days to ship back my side because I was out of packing tape.) I recieved the replacement, though, and everything is good with it.

Apparently, though, because the seller didn't wait to ship, eBay thinks they haven't sent me anything. I want to do the honest thing here, and get this case closed, but I can't find the option on the website. Directions say it should be on the return details mage, but there's no actions available there.

Can anyone advise on what I can do here? My seller is a good person who made an honest mistake and then made good on it, so I want to get this closed out in a way that doesn't harm their account.",2,2,2017-08-21,EBAY,0.09047281742095947,0.8750931620597839,0.03443407639861107

Ebay,"My own little Ebay nightmare story, and question","First off, lemme say I've already learned SO many lessons from these events, so when you read something and go ""wow, that was dumb"" - yeah, I know. :p So over a year ago, I had a truly upsetting and nerve-fraying incident with an Ebay buyer that took several weeks to resolve.

I had listed a high end electronics part worth several hundreds of dollars, which was new/sealed in box. By this point I had already had a couple of scammers, the first one was obvious and I reported the buyer and had the auction/transaction cancelled, and the second almost got me (I had a notification about a buyer not being valid and their account being removed... AFTER I shipped the item. Actually had to pay out the nose to have the shipping company intercept and return it to me. Which is a whole 'nother nightmare, but anyway...)

The third time I listed I got a buyer who seemed sorta legit, was a new account but had some minimal feedback and qualified for the PayPal buyer protection crap.

So I thought, OK cool, if this turns out to be some type of scam I'll be covered. But to be on the safe side after dealing with two scammers already, I filmed and photographed the item being packaged, along with the tracking label etc. Fast forward a few days, I got a notification from Ebay that this buyer reported that he received an empty box. My heart sank like a rock because I knew this scammer was going to pull shit to get the item and all my money to boot. An Ebay case was opened and we had some back and forth where I uploaded by shipment proof, and then the scammer thought he had a trump card: when I created the shipping label (at home, on my PC) I estimated the package weight, which turned out to be a couple lbs less than what it actually was (didn't have a scale to weight it and it never even crossed my mind to go look up manufacturer's specs on the weight.) So on the shipping label it just says the weight I entered. The scammer used this info to build his ""case"" against me and successfully got the case closed in his favor.

Well I wasn't going to accept that obviously, so ended up calling the local police and the police in the scammer's area to go over what my options were. Had case numbers opened at both police departments to keep track of time frames etc. Meanwhile I was trying to get some help from PayPal and Ebay, totally unsuccessfully (would take like 2 pages just to explain how all that BS went. But basically Ebay was telling me to contact PayPal, PayPal was telling me that Ebay settled the case already so there was nothing I could do.

Eventually after calling Ebay customer service every single day for several days I finally got connected to the high value fraud department at Ebay (or whatever it's called) and spoke to a woman who was extremely helpful. Basically reopened my case and allowed me to fully tell my story and submit my various evidence. One thing that I knew would be very helpful was that I was able to obtain the full billing information from the shipping company which contained the *actual recorded shipping weight* which superceded the estimated weight I had entered when created the label.

FINALLY PayPal closed the case in my favor. Didn't hear anything for about a year on this. I had been absolutely *epically* stressed over the whole thing so being able to move on was a massive relief. I actually broke my right big toe from kicking a chair in frustration at one point. Yes, seriously.

Today I received an Ebay message/e-mail from the buyer/scammer (yes, a *full year* later) saying ""Uh oh.... too bad, so sad! Looks like its bad news for you."" I have no clue what this guy is talking about, but I'm already starting to stress over what new scammer bullsh*t he might be pulling now.

Ebay,eBay favoring buyer scammer.,"I have posted about this before just giving some updates (this is my first ebay sale). So i sold a new laptop in excellent working condition to whom i believe to be a scammer. He claims the laptop has scratches and dinks and does not perform well and he saying that i sent him a damaged item and delivery did not cause it. I know he is lying but ebay is 100% on his side. He sent pictures that are not of my laptop and look nothing like my laptop. He took 1 picture of the front of the laptop which looks excellent and then posted 9 other fake pictures of damaged stuff i dont even know what it is. I told ebay about the pictures i have called 3 times ""THEY DO NOT CARE ONE BIT"" i have told them to compare them to the ones from my listing all they do is change the subject when i ask to speak to manager they put me on hold for 10+ and then hangup. So of course he opens a item not as described case and he gets his refund now ebay is forcing me to pay for ANOTHER shipping label so he can send it back in 5 days or he gets the item and i have to refund. I have a feeling hes going to send it back damaged or ruined and ebay will still take his side. I have spent over 40$ in shipping and packaging. And the result is he still has my item and his money.

Ebay,Buyer (10 rating) requested return even though I explicitly stated no returns,"Some information:
The buyer has 10 ratings, I have just over 40 with maybe a dozen items sold over the lifespan of my account.

Found really old but brand new in box items around the house and checked the price. Was surprised at how much they were so decided to list them on ebay and sell them.


Stated in listing that I found these, they are unopened but I was unsure whether or not they worked. Because most of the value rests on the fact that they are brand new, I said no returns would be accepted. 


Prior to shipping out the item, because of the low ratings of the buyer I had messaged the buyer and restated the listing's notes.
[Here](http://puu.sh/xgaAm/4e605197ad.png)

They said as long as its unopened they wanted it and did not say no to my ""you understand all sales are final"".


Today I received a refund request with a message stating that it doesn't completely work (which means they opened the package). 

How do I proceed? There's a chance that the item had that when I shipped it out but I had stated no returns (does that protect me?). There is also the possibility that the buyer swapped out the item for an item of their own and said it doesn't work. Do I offer a partial refund? 

I also have to pay shipping back which would put me out of pocket for the the shipping fees both ways. 


Thanks.



Edit: Oh and I have no negative feedback if that matters.

Ebay,Buyer filed INR. Tracking shows delivered.,"Had somebody file INR today even though tracking showed delivered.  And they admitted this but say they never received it. I told them to call their local P.O and I would do the same.Anyways.

First person may not help but that doesn't mean you shouldn't give up.

Ebay,Worried about losing £600 on ebay:(,"I recently bought a guitar i was told was as new and had a description of the factory guitar with just the words ""in perfect overall condition"" below. The photos were kind of dark and made the guitar look new and unmarked so i asked if it was worn and i was told it was only played a handful of times and stored in a hard case. Well i received the guitar and it was worse looking cosmetically than the pictures but the worst thing is the electronic pick yps have been changed from the factory pick ups that are written in the listing. The guitar is only a few years old and the pick up in the bridge is not part of the emg81/85 set( the only way i can tell this without me opening the guitar is that it is loose in the guitar and the emg logo should match on both pick ups but it does not. Upon closer inspection of the same guitar i found out the pick up mounting brackets are different too and i found the frets were indeed worn in places. This guitar is £800 new and as the listing stated perfect condition and had a factory description with emg81/85 set but with no mention of any after market alterations. When i plugged it in it sounds horrible like broken horrible:( Im now in the waiting process with the seller sending me messages accusing me of being a scammer etc and im just worried about losing that much money for a scrap guitar. The seller is even trying to say i have taken it apart when i havent and he screen shot my own listing of my old guitar i was selling to upgrade to the one i bought off him even though its not even the same as his guitar. He is basically saying i am stealing his guitar parts.I messaged him within an hour of receiving the item and i have boxed it up and havent touched it since. The seller has even said it could of been altered but how would they know it has. Its like they are admitting something is not right with the guitar. I rang ebay and i have to wait 4 more days until i can call back to get a decision but the seller is spamming my mail trying to make me sound like a scammer telling me i cant do a return as they dont accept returns and im wasting my time. Its obvious something is wrong with the guitar and that the seller knows this too as if it was returned by now and they honestly believed it was worth £600 they would be able to sell it again on ebay but i have a feeling they know they have conned me. I can accept cosmetic damage as i understand sometime items on ebay can photograph better than they look but the fact that the electronics are not factory as stated in the description is so unacceptable in my opinion. I have been on ebay 10 years with thousands of positive feedback and ive never had anyone so horrible act the way this seller is. 

 i wondered if anyone else has had this happen and if anyone had any advice for me

- i bought a guitar with a factory specification in the description and the words perfect condition

- i received a guitar with changed from factory electronics that were not stated in the description

- seller is refusing a refund and now trying to make me sound like a scammer 

- im really worried im going to be conned and stuck with a pile of scrap and empty wallet

I bought phenibut on ebay from a seller with 800 feedback (795 pos 5 neg) 4 of this negative feedback is from phenibut product i bought too.  
So.. i bought it with paypal, it arrived 3 days later, i used it the next day and its bunk product, no effect at all. Most of you probly dont know what phenibut is, its an aminoacid used to combat anxiety and aid sleep.  
(It has subtle effects, i use it for 12 month now (1x weekly) from different manufacturers so i know the effects.)  
So i check his feedback for first time and discover negative feedback about that product, describing my experience.  
I message him saying his phenibut has 0 effect, even on 700% dosage (300mg recommended, tried 2000mg, just to be sure, and i know the effects very well). I ask him for a solution.  
He answers promptly saying he sent this batch to a lab to see if something is wrong and is waiting for a result. (This indicates to me that I'm not the first person complaining, also he has negative feedback about it already). And he offers me a free pack phenibut as a solution.  
I answer him I'm happy he wants to solve this etc but  I'm not interested in more pack of his bunk product.  
He answers me he will refund my money after i leave positive feedback.  
I tell him im happy about that but I'd like to wait with feedback until i got the money.  
He answers no positive feedback no refund.  
I message him again telling him i will leave negative feedback and reporting him to ebay staff if he doesn't refund me, i also told him i will send 98% of the product back (from my money) before he has to refund so he can check it himself.   
Then i get an answer from a russian email provider with a fake name jones something and he writes his lawyer will contact me if i leave negative feedback.  
I tell him i don't want to communicate off ebay about this so he should copy paste that message and send it to me with his ebay account and i will ignore further messages from that email. (So he cant say later that email doesnt belong to him)  
He answers me again with that russian email and now he writes if i leave negative feedback he will consider a ""russian solution"".  
Last communication between us was from me saying after this threat i will report him not only to ebay staff and leave negative feedback also i have to report him the Kriminalpolizei in germany (dont know the right term in english, criminal police?).  
That's it, no more answer and no money back yet, but its possible i will get it later this day...  
What should i do? Should i leave negative feedback and report him to ebay and Kriminalpolizei? Or just take a loss...",7,3,2017-08-24,EBAY,0.14260603487491608,0.8320546746253967,0.02533928118646145

Ebay,Item returned for incorrect address. Address is a business and I can google/locate it myself?,"I shipped an item to a business location.  It looks like a freight forwarding company and the buyer is the owner of this business.  I received a notification from the post office that they couldn't deliver the item and that the postage due is $24.19.  It cost me $13.63 to ship it via FedEx SmartPost.

I did some digging and I was able to find the business via google maps so I believe the item should have been deliverable.

1. Am I going to have to eat the $24.19 cost to get it back from the post office?

2. Do I have to pay again to have it shipped?

3. The buyer doesn't appear to speak any English.  He sent me a message once entirely in Spanish.  Is it worth calling his business number to see if it's a valid location?

**EDIT
Okay... I found out what happened.**

The buyer provided an incorrect address. For some reason he put the street number in a separate line.
So the address should be:

""Street Number"" Street 
City, State, Zip

He has it as:

Street, 
City, State, Zip Company Name, ""Street Number""

Even though I showed it to the post office, they could not make the modification to the address. It is indeed the buyer's fault.

Onto the next issue... The $24.19. I used FedEx Smart Post. The US Post Office considers this to be a ""Parcel Select"" service. This is different from the ""First Class"" and ""Priority Mail"" services, which will provide return service for free. So as a result, I had to pay this to get the package back.

I decided to call eBay to see what to do. They advised me to cancel the order due to an incorrect address and issue a refund, less the $24.19 it took to get the package back. I have a feeling the buyer will be upset about that, but it isn't my fault. Lesson learned.",6,2,2017-08-24,EBAY,0.14824701845645905,0.8281969428062439,0.023556038737297058

Ebay,No mystery boxes,"After watching a YouTube video about people buying mystery boxes off of eBay, I thought I'd try a small experiment and list a mystery box of my own. Unlike other mystery boxes, I actually posted pictures of the open box so people can see the contents. And I priced it really cheaply (the video I watched had a $100 mystery box, and it still contained crap). 

After about four days, eBay unceremoniously deleted my listing with a notice that mystery boxes are forbidden. And there's apparently a rule about this. 

I really didn't mind, as I was just dabbling, but mystery boxes still come up easily on a search term.

This same buyer caused me a 2 month long headache earlier this year when he claimed a PS3 I sent was DOA. He sent back a brick and got refunded, and ebay said there was nothing they could do for me.

Edit: The listings were .99 cents each on every one he bought, so I was planning on shipping with 1 stamp (no tracking) - If I end up sending this stuff, do I need to do first class (an extra $2+ on all 200 packages) or will he just say they all arrived damaged/not as described?

Edit2: I called ebay and they said I needed to ship and there was no proof he was threatening me (regardless of the past transaction).

Ebay,Left negative feedback which was removed in a few hours?,"Hi all,

I purchased a clothing item. It wasn't what I remembered ordering, but similar, so I figured I had made a mistake in my order and wore it. Went to leave positive feedback for seller and realized they did send me the wrong item. Sent them images of the product I was sent and asked if we could come to a resolution where I could be sent the correct item and pay for shipping, was open to communicating with them. They were very short with me and rude. They said not to message them anymore (which I didn't) and would block me if I did and that they were contacting Ebay. After she sent me that message, I left a negative review saying ""Item was not as described. Tried to resolve politely. They were rude."" The feedback was removed within hours without any notification to me. I've escalated it through eBay to several managers, and they have stated that the seller ""provided evidence which they can not disclose"" that warranted them removing my feedback. They also stated that once a decision is made, they can't reinstate feedback. How is this even possible? They have images of the item I received, and they have the messages that I sent to the seller and that they sent to me seeing that I tried to resolve the issue and that the seller was rude to me (I made sure to be polite). There were no violations in the feedback I left. How was it so easily removed? How is this not fraud?

A few issues with this message that left me confused...

1. WTF, I never sold this device???
1. Why is ebay telling me to cancel something on the customer's behalf? 
1. Customer Service department is closed right now, at the time when this email was sent.
1. What is really strange is that this weird mail passes the ""how to tell if an email is really from eBay"" test found [here](http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/recognizing-spoof.html), aka ""*The easiest way to make sure an email is from us is to check your messages in My eBay. Go to My eBay, and then click the Messages tab. If you don't see the same message there, the email is fake*"" **which actually is in my messages tab...**



Also, I did sell a similar Xperia device 30 minutes before I got this email, but that seems to be completely unrelated.

Ebay,Buyer returned an item broken and 2 months after date of transaction,"I want to share this experience here as it may help other eBay sellers.  My husband and I are a TRS with an eBay store.  Luckily, we rarely have returns or complaints and this is the first time I refused a refund and had a chargeback dispute.  We have 100% feedback, which we do try and keep it that way.  So, the buyer returned the item 2 months after purchase and we received it back completely broken.  I explained this to the buyer and that I was not going to issue her a refund (I waited for the full 60 days to pass before responding so she couldn’t leave negative feedback).  She wasn’t able to make a claim with eBay so she did a chargeback dispute on PayPal claiming she didn’t receive a refund or credit.  Below is my response to the chargeback:  

&amp;nbsp;

“Item was purchased by buyer on June 1, 2017.  Buyer contacted me directly indicating she was ""not satisfied"" with the item.  I offered and sent a label to the buyer to return the item on June 5, 2017.  Buyer never opened a return item case with eBay.  I have a 30-day return policy that is noted on the listing.  I continued to contact the buyer and ensure she would return the item, with little response.  It was not returned until 2 months (60 days) after the date of transaction.    

&amp;nbsp;

This is well beyond the return period policy that is noted on the listing.  Also, the buyer did not return the item in the same condition it was received, which is the BUYER'S RESPONSIBILITY if they expect a full refund for an item.  The buyer returned a filthy, used, broken item.  This is not the same item that was sent to her or in the same condition.  Buyer is fraudulently trying to bypass standard return policies by returning an item after using it for 2 months and then attempting to return a completely broken item that is beyond repair or resale.  The buyer is not entitled to a refund as they claimed.  There is nothing to refund.  The buyer uses an item for 2 months and breaks it.  THAT IS THE BUYER'S LOSS and cannot return an item in such condition to any merchant, period.    

&amp;nbsp;

Even the biggest companies with the most lenient return policy whereby you can return used items, doesn't offer a buyer the opportunity to return a used item THAT IS ALSO BROKEN/DAMAGED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!   It has nothing to do with the seller of the item.  This is a case of return fraud and buyer wants someone else to pay for her to use something for months and break it.  I was willing to accept the buyer's return even beyond the 30 days as a one-time courtesy, but not a completely useless, broken item the buyer is trying to pass off as a valid return.  Seller is not responsible for this invalid return or for any refund to the buyer.”  

&amp;nbsp;

We, the sellers, won the chargeback dispute.  I was actually surprised.  I’ll be honest, this was a $20 item.  It was out of principle that we did not back down on this one.  We do more than enough to make our customers happy, but we didn’t want to accept this return/refund without some sort of response.  

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Buyer returned an item broken and 2 months after date of transaction, seller wins chargeback dispute.",9,10,2017-08-28,EBAY,0.18373365700244904,0.7813884019851685,0.034877926111221313

She claims she received the bigger item and not the 2 smaller items, and also says in her eBay messages that she collected her item from the post office and immediately threw out the box and everything else included and only kept the bigger item - so she can't and refused to send any pictures.

I'm completely certain she is either lying about everything or accidentally threw out the smaller items ($40 value). Since eBay rarely supports its sellers, do you think I have a leg to stand on?

Ebay,ebay will restrict your seller account if buyers send you their contact info via messages,"I have been an ebay powerseller since about 2008 and a member since 1999. I have a mid level store with only fixed priced auto renewed listings and sell a few thousand $ per month in used auto parts and misc items. I do not run auctions.

Recently I went through my store to clean out some old items that had not sold in a long time and add new items, which I do every few months. 

About two months ago I ended a few items that hadn't sold, and I got a warning email from ebay about selling outside of ebay. I called ebay at that time to inquire what that was about and the rep told me that the system automatically reviews prior messages sent and received on each listing for evidence of exchanging contact info or offers to sell outside ebay. Since one of the items I had ended had a message sent by a buyer who included his phone number and asked me to call him, ebay had given him a strike on his account and had copied me as a ""courtesy"" even though I did not call this buyer or reply to his messages. The rep assured me that I had no strikes against my account and this issue would not impact me in any way.

Last week I ended a listing for an engine which had been posted for a long time. I did so because I wound up using this engine myself in a personal project because it had never sold. Immediately after ending this listing, I received a warning email from ebay reiterating their policies about selling outside of ebay etc. Since the listing was no longer active I could not go back and look at any of the old messages sent from buyers re: that item, but I assume that at some point in the listing's history one or more buyers had sent me questions asking for a discount, or a trade, or to sell outside of ebay, or some other such thing, and I decided to ignore it since it was likely the same issue I had spoken to the rep about a couple months ago.

Today I was listing new items and noticed another old listing for a bumper cover. Ebay had a note under the listing in my store backend stating that it had not had any sales in 16 months so I should consider revising it. I decided to end the listing and try to sell it locally at a discount to get the part out of my way (it's quite bulky to store). 

Immediately after ending this listing, ebay sends me a notification that my account has been restricted for 7 days for selling outside ebay. I assume that again, at some point in this listing's history, some buyer has sent me a question asking for a discount or a cash price etc. which I probably either responded to decline, or ignored and forgot about.

Apparently in the eyes of ebay, if at any time any ebay buyer sends you a message asking for a discounted price or to buy outside of ebay, and you later end that listing manually for any reason, ebay will consider this proof that you have completed the sale of that item outside their system, and ban you accordingly. 

I am unsure what the proper procedure in this situation is, from their point of view, but this is just a heads up for the sellers out there. I would suggest that you completely ignore any such messages/questions you might receive from buyers, which might make it easier to dispute with ebay if and when they take action against your account. 

I know, I know, I'm about to get a dozen ""call ebay"" responses. THe purpose of this post is not for me to get help or advice but just for me to make you all aware of what is happening with ebay's new policies.

I've bought and sold more items on half.com than I could ever count. eBay has never been anything but endless frustration for me (admittedly, a casual user, someone who isn't trying to make a living with this stuff) concerning the calculation and collection/payment of shipping costs and the endless phony listings and scams I have to sift through whenever I try to use it.

Ebay,Beware of fake microSD cards! How can we stop this felon?,"I purchased a supposed 256 GB SanDisk microSD card for $84.99.  I knew it looked too good to be true, but since the seller had positive feedback and the item had buyer protection I went ahead and ordered one.   I received the card in less than a week, it had retail packaging that _SEEMED_ legit.  Everything _SEEMED_ to work at first, my PC regonized the card and it reported 250 GB free.  
 
However, after I spent many hours copying files to it (at an unacceptably slow rate of speed, a red flag), suddenly the card became corrupted and not recognized by Windows.  All of the data I had copied to it was gone.  I reformatted the drive and ran a test with FakeFlashTest.  After over a day of testing this was the result:
 
https://postimg.org/image/fy92mu3id/
 
The card is now not useable at all and is not recognized by Windows.  The reason is, it was a fake card that did not hold 256 GB (it only reported that it did which is quite easy to do), and when more data was written than it could actually hold, it became corrupted and unusable.    
 
These types of scammers are very insidious and dificult to detect, because the cards they are selling appear to be legit in every way.  However, if you know what to look for and examine things closely (i.e. the quality of the print on the card and packaging, and fabrication details of the card itself), it becomes clear that they are not genuine.  (I only wish I had been aware of this before I bought it).  
 
So, what to do from the standpoint of eBay... I initiated a return (which the seller will likely ignore) and reported the item, for starters.  Unfortunately all of the other buyers of the card are hidden, so I can't contact them.  So far 74 of the cards have been sold, with 6 still for sale.  This is not just one or two fake cards being sold, it is a major operation, and a felony.  Is there anything else we can do to stop this seller?

Ebay,Real offer vs. messaged offer,"Just found this sub and joined. Can't believe I didn't check it out sooner!

I'm selling an item with Best Offer. A buyer negotiated a price in Messages but can't pay for a few days. I agreed and told them to send me an 'official' Offer. This was a few days ago and I haven't received their offer. Now a new buyer sent me an 'official' Offer over and above the one from Messages. 

Am I bound to the first one? I have no intention of going back to further negotiate because I don't think that's fair. But I did give the first person the option to send an Offer and they haven't. thanks for any advice!",3,2,2017-08-30,EBAY,0.02700498141348362,0.9025484323501587,0.07044664770364761
Ebay,Why is eBay not more kind to their sellers?,"I have had eBay side with extremely rude 0 feedback buyers who registered the same day as the purchases, in disputes. Obvious scam disputes. But still they side with them, even though I am a TRS 100% feedback seller with thousands of transactions.

What is the psychology behind all of this? Do they value a random russian scammer more than someone who pays over $1000 in fees to them every month, who has a perfect track record? Or are they actually enjoying to intentionally tease their sellers? No matter how much I think about it, I just dont get it.",33,26,2017-08-31,EBAY,0.05784425511956215,0.8898610472679138,0.05229474604129791
Ebay,"US ebayers, please stop using UPS to ship to Canada.","After paying $100 US for postage and shipping, it's not a pleasant experience to get hit at the door by UPS for another $60 in ""brokerage fees,"" etc. I don't need to pay them to fill out a form for something that doesn't need duty charged. Use the USPS which will pass it to Canada Post, send it tracked and signed for if necessary and charge for that. If there are honest duty charges to be paid, Canada post will collect them.

Ebay,Unresponsive Buyer Leaves Negative after Finding item damaged 30 days after purchase.,"I guess this is more of a rant since I feel that its not possible to get it changed..

30 Days ago I shipped a pokemon card (of course all my ebay issues stem back to this baby crap). I put the card in a protector sleeve. Cut to pieces of card board to put over it then wrapped it in bubble wrap and shipped. Now 29 days and 20 hrs technically I get a negative feedback the card was damaged. I have a 30 day return policy asking if he would like to return full refund or if he wants a partial refund. No response.

I contact Ebay of course they do nothing

I call and text the buyer multiple times after getting their number from paypal. nothing. 

I contact the CEO of Ebay to see if the feedback can be removed considering the buyer won't prove its damaged or send it back even though I have a return policy. I receive a priceless message at how feedback doesn't matter anymore yadayadayada....(if it doesn't matter why can't it be removed right?)

So basically its impossible from me to resolve this issue since Ebay really doesn't care that I am trying to resolve it. Basically the short story is what we all ready know Ebay will do what ever the buyer wants and doesn't care about its sellers.",15,7,2017-08-31,EBAY,0.14343102276325226,0.8322978019714355,0.024271203204989433

Ebay,What to do in this situation ?,"I sold a laptop a few weeks ago and have been in a constant dispute with a buyer. As soon as he received it he opened a ""INAD"" case claiming it did not perform well and had scratches and marks on it. Of course i find this to be a lie because i sent it out in perfect working condition with no signs of use it was a new item that was a gift to me that i just took out of the box and sold on ebay ""never used it"". So i kindly said he could return it and paid for the return shipping and sent a label. I calculated the shipping cost twice.. paid for the correct label and sent it to him. I called eBay and they said all i had to do was wait for him to return. Well the next day i get a email from eBay saying the buyer told them he needed $18 dollars to ship the item and my label wasn't enough money to ship the item according to USPS. So of course eBay and the buyer expect me to pay for yet ANOTHER SHIPPING LABEL.... i am beyond furious.. buyer also told eBay i was using offensive language when i have been nothing but nice to him. So i called eBay and told them i sent the correct label and was sure the buyer was lying. They said that they see the label i sent and it was correct and to just wait for the buyer to send it back... i dont believe them at all my case is on hold and i feel like they will give it to the buyer any day now.",7,3,2017-08-31,EBAY,0.07270268350839615,0.8895293474197388,0.03776796534657478
Ebay,Buyer reporting item as faulty - what are my options?,"I sold a GPU, and clearly stated that there are a couple of backplate screws missing but that they don't appear to affect the temperature (no guarantee, just that they don't appear to). It was working fine 24 hours before shipping.

The buyer (brand new, 0 feedback) has now claimed that the card overheated after 30 minutes of gaming, closing the game, and that they cannot open their game without Windows crashing. They also stated that they cannot get any evidence of this.

This sounds very unusual - even an overheating card should throttle rather than turning off, and the temperature they reported was still 5 degrees below the throttling temperature. Either way it should not crash Windows.

I offered to refund the item if they returned the card and it was indeed faulty, and the same item I sent (I have pictures of the serial number), which they initially accepted, but later declined and said they would request eBay assistance instead because I won't give them a guaranteed refund when they return the item. This seems fairly dodgy in and of itself.

Am I taking the right actions? Is there something else I should be doing here? I'm sure as hell not refunding a £200 graphics card without evidence that it's faulty.",13,3,2017-08-31,EBAY,0.2174467146396637,0.7513229846954346,0.031230321153998375

Ebay,If one eBay account is suspended/banned will your other other ones be as well?,"First off just want to pre-face this by saying this isn't related to scamming people or anything. I sell various obscure supplements, and Pay Pal doesn't take a kind view on some of these products.
Of course it is impossible to know what actually is allowed or not, and in the past I have had them just decide that something is no longer ok, and have been suspended and had my pay pal frozen.
For example they just kicked sellers of caffeine tablets and powder off my domestic version of eBay, no warning or anything.
I was thinking of having a separate account to sell the risker things that I am not so sure about on, so that my main account doesn't get banned and force me to start over again.
I am just wondering if I make the account with a seperate pay pal and login email if eBay will go to the trouble of tracing it back and freezing my main account as well.

Ebay,ebay Seller Hub - How to set a sale / discount?,"Recently decided to try the newer ebay Seller Hub GUI. Liking some of the re-organization, disliking some of it. But I am wondering if there was a way to set a discount or promotion for no extra cost or fees.

As an example, buy two items and get a third free. Or buy one, get the second 50% off. I have a regular ebay sellers account and never subscribed to Selling Manager. And would it be possible to run multiple promotions at once? 

For example, buy two get one free for a certain type of items, and a promotion of buy one get one 50% off for another type.",5,2,2017-08-31,EBAY,0.02756992168724537,0.9288411736488342,0.04358889162540436
