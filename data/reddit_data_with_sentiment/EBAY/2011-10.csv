Ebay,Sold a laptop; buyer claims it arrived broken.  A bit cautious about how to proceed.,"So glad there's this subreddit!  I have been selling since 1999, and have always been able to figure out disputes, but this time I'm a bit concerned.  I could really use some advice before proceeding.

Background: I sold my used laptop for $195.  It was in good used condition with no scratches or any broken parts.  I wiped all my data off and the only only data on the laptop was Windows 7 and a Office 2007.  I opted not to purchase insurance because this was a relatively low-value sale; I did however purchase tracking.  As soon as the package arrived, I got a message:
 


""laptop i recived from you dont power on

screen is damage,dont work

i want to return it for a full refound"".  



I asked for more detail about what was wrong with the screen, and the buyer responded with ""screen is cracked"".

I have sold about a dozen laptops on eBay over the years, and something seems not quite right to me.  I worked for about 7 years as a hardware and software IT tech, and I know that a cracked screen and a machine that won't power on are generally unrelated problems.  As the laptop was shipped off in perfect, tested working condition, I feel there is a really low chance that both these problems occurred because of poor package or damage from shipping.

I have 100% feedback and don't want to see it damaged.  I didn't purchase insurance because I took a calculated risk that something like this could happen, and honestly if this ends up with me losing $200 then I am OK - I took on the risk knowing that this might be the outcome.  

The reason I am questioning the validity of the buyer's claim before doing anything else is that I've read of scams where someone will return a previously existing broken, same model laptop and keep the new one.  

The auction contained pictures of the laptop while powered on showing an intact screen, closeups of both sides showing the I/O ports, and a picture of the DVD drive opened.  I have a picture I took of the machine's serial number on the bottom, but I did not put this in the auction photos.  I do have it for reference to match against the serial number of the returned laptop.

I accept that this may be a losing battle for me, and am kind of jaded about the possibility of this working out in my favor.  I do also accept that there is a chance the laptop did get damaged in the shipping process, in which case I want to resolve things quickly for the buyer.  Before doing anything else though, I do want to ask a few things:

* Should I just tell the seller to return the laptop and I will refund their money once I inspect the laptop?  Or is it better to request that they open a case with eBay Buyer Protection in order to follow proper procedure?

* Should I let the buyer know that I have pictures of the serial number, and that I will be checking the returned machine against my photos to make sure they match before I refund their money?

* Any other advice?

UPDATE: the buyer sent me a picture of the correct serial number, and a picture of the damage.  There were some marks on the case that helped me identify the laptop as the original one I sent.  The damage to the screen is pretty bad.  I am guessing this happened during shipping, bummer!  I gave them my address and let them know that I would refund their money as soon as I receive the laptop and verify that nothing is missing.  Well, this is the first time I've ever had anything go bad with shipping.  I'm mostly just relieved that this is not a scam, which was leaving me with a really bad feeling.  I guess I'll try to sell it for parts.  Anyways, thanks for all the advice!",6,0,2011-10-01,EBAY,0.09424388408660889,0.8618306517601013,0.04392540827393532
Ebay,Why are professional vendors allowed to wait with feedback?,"I've seen this time and time again when buying on ebay: I buy a product, I pay via Paypal, so all my obligations are fulfilled - yet I do not get any feedback until I put in a feedback for the transaction (which I won't do until I have the item).

I once asked a seller about this and they explained they automate the feedback process. That's all fine, but how is it ok to not give feedback once all my obligations are fulfilled and instead wait for my feedback first? Shouldn't ebay have a check in place for this, especially since Paypal is so integrated into the system anyway?",13,0,2011-10-01,EBAY,0.027404142543673515,0.9247294068336487,0.04786640778183937
Ebay,ebay perm suspension,"Iv been emailing / ringing ebay as my account was suspended indefinitely. 

The reason was a few months ago when the fake Kingston 256gb USBS were around I was stupid enough to buy some on Alibaba (they were even listed in the promoted products) Either way I was a moron thinking they could actually be real.

Anyway I tested them and they seemed to work (as the usbs read as 256gb) and put them up after 12 hours I opened one up and found it was fake and de-listed them.. I had sold around 5 and refunded everyone and apologised. But apparently eBay actually took my item off ebay not me. So I was in fractioned or something  

Skip a month of two later I'm selling caps making some good money, and I get a message saying I'm Perm banned. 

I've been talking with them for over a month now. And recently received another email saying they wont budge.

Is there anything else I can do to get my seller account back.. I have just contacted Kingston seeing if they can do anything (as they issued the thing to take all usbs down)

before anyone says it, yes I know I am stupid.",0,0,2011-10-02,EBAY,0.14079003036022186,0.8322871327400208,0.02692280523478985

Ebay,So I'm a young guy from Canada making some bids when suddenly..,"Some essential details. My bank offers a Visa Debit program, and I have the card. I seen that Ebay.ca was a participating [retailer](http://www.visa.ca/en/personal/visa-debit-card/visa_debit_merchants.jsp) and I immediately jumped to buy some stuff. 

After placing a couple bids, I remembered that when I purchased stuff with the card before (from a different site), I had to pay the customs fee with a real credit card, and not the visa-debit card. I had to borrow my sisters credit card to pay the customs fee. She got mad. 

Now we get to the question. When I unwillingly win the auction I just entered, how am I supposed to pay for the customs fee? Because I seen that Ebay was a participating retailer, it made forget all about customs fees and whatnot. I also bought items from another company not situated in Canada. 

I don't care if this gets downvoted, I just need some help. It's damned near impossible to find information about ecommerce, customs fees and visa debit information online. 


Obviously, I am utterly useless when it comes to ordering items online.",11,2,2011-10-11,EBAY,0.05542241036891937,0.9204462170600891,0.02413133904337883

She contacts me, telling me that I sent her the wrong bag (the wrong design, different to the one in the picture). As I only had ONE bag, I knew there was something fishy. After asking further, she asked for a refund, or a replacement. All my sales are final, so I told her to take a photo of it, and send it to me. After not receiving any photo, she claimed that it was counterfeit, and demanded a refund.

The kicker is that at the same time she was demanding an outside of eBay transaction refund, she was trying to re-sell the bag on her account. She also demanded my contact details. 

So, I've reported her, but she sent me a message about it today. Tell me if you can understand it...
