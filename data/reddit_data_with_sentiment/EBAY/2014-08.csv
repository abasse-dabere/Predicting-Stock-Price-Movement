Ebay,Sold an iPod. Buyer took a hammer to it. Sent it back to me. Help?,"Hey r/eBay,

I recently sold an iPod with charger on eBay (6/10/14), got paid through paypal quickly and shipped it out the next day. No hassles or communication with the buyer at all. I sent the buyer a tracking number.

I left positive feedback a few days ago and today I got a surprise in the mail today (8/1/14) A certified package that required my signature. I signed for it, not sure what to expect and when I opened it, I found inside a iPod that had been thoroughly hammered upon.

Inside it was my original brown packaging and some bubble wrap in perfect condition, a destroyed iPod, a letter stating the following:
&gt; Dear [TrentWarpig],

&gt;I am returning this ipod

&gt;that was sent to me -

&gt;Someone got into my account

&gt;and ordered things - Ebay

&gt;is aware of this -

&gt;Please credit my account

&gt;with ebay-

&gt;Sorry for the inconvenience

&gt;[Buyer]

I am not sure what to do. I had to sign for the package and I'm not sure if that makes me liable in some way. The listing ended about 50ish days ago, so I'm not sure how it will go with eBay. I have received no messages through eBay or Paypal at all.

I also noticed that the serial numbers do not seem to match up, but I never put the serial number on the eBay auction, I can only try to see from the pictures I posted with the listing.

[**The iPod before pictures**](http://imgur.com/a/D0x3D#0)

[**The iPod after pictures**] (http://imgur.com/a/c80zB#3)

[**eBay listing pictures** ] (http://imgur.com/a/Y9D0z#0)

I don't know what to do. Should I contact eBay about this? Is this common?

**Update**: The person filed an unauthorized payment claim with paypal. I supplied everything that I had but all that was really required was to prove that I sent it to the verified paypal address. It took Paypal 6 days, but the case was settled against the buyer and I got my money back.

I am now $.90 richer due to funding my paypal with my rewards credit card and withdrawing it back into my bank account and I have a seriously beat up iPod to do whatever with I suppose. I'll hang onto it for another 3 months or so in case the buyer tries anything else funny. 

The buyer is out the $8 dollars it took to ship the broken iPod to me.

I sell on eBay part time and my life has been rather hectic so I only got a chance to look into the situation recently and I think I may have found the problem. 

In the category that I am selling I offer my products at a lower price than my competitors, however, my listings have been pushed down the page and barely get any views.

I offer the lowest price, including free shipping and somehow am getting buried by other sellers when searching by best match/lowest price. Is there something I am missing?

Ebay,Anyone else think this new eBay seller review is BS?,"Man, I'm going from ""above average"" to ""below average"" because of cases OPENED -- yep, it goes based on cases opened, not happily resolved and self-resolved..

So no matter what you offer the customer, no matter how happy you make them after (usually reimbursement $$ or solving problem fast), you get punished.

So the question is: What incentive is there to actually treat the customer well after the case has been opened? I really see no encouragement to offer really anything once a case has been opened. No matter how satisfied they are after, it effects our scores:

So.... am I just hanging here on morality? I'm a good guy, but hey, there are a lot of stupid people on eBay and this is not necessarily encouraging me to be nice to these type of people :P

Ebay,"For those who sell men's clothes, new marketplace is now available and it works - GRAILED.COM. I am a former ebayer. Please take it seriously. I am not wasting your time!!!","Hey guys!  I am a former ebay seller, 300K in sales, purged last year for no reason really.  I tried selling my leftover mens clothes inventory on bonanza and other marketplaces but with little success.  In the fall of last year, I came across this website on reddit's frugal fashion subreddit that was just set up:  Grailed.com and so far sold over 50 items - here is the link to my 'wardrobe' : http://www.grailed.com/users/myitems/435-outletmonster

Grailed.com is absolutely free to list and to buy.  But what distinguishes it from other venues is that the website has started paying the sellers' paypal fee for the sold items, which is truly revolutionary!!!  So the website is TOTALLY FREE TO BUY AND TO SELL!!!  

In terms of the convenience, the listing process is a breeze from the seller's perspective, and buying is even easier.  The site's popularity has been growing by leaps and bounds as far as I can tell largely through the word of mouth and social media rumoring.  

The guys who came up with it are pretty talented.  Who knows, maybe by spreading the word in the seller's community and continued growth, they will come up with the equally ingeniously designed verson of 'grailed' for women and/or other specialized items and groups.  You know better than anyone else that the sellers community has been clamoring for friendlier marketplace and grailed.com is a truly one of them.

Ebay,"Buyer purchases item at noon, leaves negative feedback 13 hours later complaining that the item hasn't shipped yet. How do I handle this?","The buyer did buy-it-now and paid around noon today.  I noticed just now that he's already left negative feedback with the comment ""well it hasn't shipped yet, sucks considering how much I paid""  The listing shows 3 days handling time. The buyer has only been on ebay since July and has less than 10 feedback.

Do I call ebay on this or use the ""report buyer"" feature for leaving inappropriate feedback?  Do I contact the buyer and explain that the listing says three days handling and he needs to retract his feedback (can he even do that at this point?) 

Can I cancel the transaction or do I have to ship his item.  It's a custom item and if he's already this picky I'm not sure I want the grief. It's also an international (Canada) transaction to add to the risk.

**Edit:** I called Ebay. According to the CSR, I can't just cancel the transaction because I don't like the buyer. However, it sounds like they will remove the bad feedback. Also, I found out the buyer is underage, using his own account, so I reported him. Haven't heard back on that yet, but I'm guessing they'll close his account and void the transaction. The CSR did say until Ebay actually verifies the buyer is underage, I need to fulfill the terms of the listing.

Ebay,First time buyer needs some advice dealing with an unreasonable seller.,"Hi,let me just say that this is the first time I have used Ebay.I ordered a specific book but unfortunately,they sent me the wrong book.

Now,I know is probably just a mistake and I can appreciate that this does happen sometimes but I am a little wary because the seller asked me to return the book at my own expense even though it was his mistake.

I live in New Zealand so it would cost me more than the cost of the book to post it to the seller in the Uk.

Secondly,I read some of his feedback and I am worried that if I do send the book back for a return,that the seller won't send me the book I wanted in the first place and I will be out of pocket for the additional postage as well as the original purchase.
I decided to message the seller before leaving him any bad feedback but he won't send the correct book or refund me before I return the book to him.I explained my concern to him and he just won't compromise at all.

I have no intention of ripping the guy off.I am an honest person but I really don't want to put myself in the position to be taken advantage of.

If he sends me the book I ordered in the first place,I will return the other book to him as a matter of principle,even if I have to pay for the postage myself.

Ebay,Make sure you're blocking your bad buyers,"I had a buyer who was a jerk over a nonsensical issue. Called me rude and the like, and I always maintain friendly professionalism in all communications. He is clearly a bully and has a pattern. 

He messaged a veiled threat to the effect of: If I don't get what I want, my thoughts will be known. 

I called ebay and the rep said she, as I did, saw this as feedback extortion and any negative feedback would be removed. I was advised to block him and cease communications. Happily. 

Several weeks later, he left negative feedback, stating anger over having been blocked. 

I called ebay to have the feedback removed. I was informed his initial threat was not explicit enough to trigger feedback extortion. I respectfully disagreed. What else could he mean aside from negative feedback? But fine. 

I read ebay's negative feedback removal policies, one of which states feedback can relate only to the transaction. That he was blocked from further transactions is irrelevant.

I called ebay back. The next rep, I think, did lean toward seeing his initial threat pointed to feedback extortion, but was also interested that he was commenting on being blocked.

The negative feedback was removed. 

The buyer would have never known he was blocked unless he tried to buy something else from me. That, in combination with his series of obsessive messages, tells me he was out to ""get me."" And he would have purchased again just for an opportunity to leave more negative feedback.

Ebay,Will paypal take money out of my account without my consent if I do not pay? (shipping issue),"I can't find a straight answer anywhere for this question.

Basically I bought something, and was expecting it by August 11 because that is what I saw as the ""Delivered By"" Date. Seller just told me he cannot ship until Friday, so I probably won't get it until Tuesday. Monday I leave for vacation and thus will just have to buy the item at Wal Mart or something, so I really don't want to pay the seller. 

So if I do not pay, will paypal just take it out of my bank account? My paypal balence is always 0 but my bank account is linked to paypal. 

**Please do not comment based on if I am right or wrong. I do not know the fine print of ebay and really regret this decision and feel like crap.

Ebay,"Negative feedback for not shipping within 13 hours, underage buyer - follow up.","After a half hour on the phone yesterday and an hour today, and being transferred to the incorrect person four times, I have had the negative feedback a buyer left me removed.  The negative feedback was for not shipping the same day despite the handling time being listed as three days. I found out after-the-fact that the buyer is underage.

Notes:

* Ebay was not willing to remove the feedback until I actually shipped the item. -As of a few hours ago it still hadn't been removed.  When I called I eventually figured out that they wouldn't remove it until I actually shipped the item in case the feedback _eventually_ became true.

* Despite submitting a report that the user was underage, it didn't seem like they had actually gotten that report, or at least that they hadn't done anything to act on it.

* I was eventually able to get one of the reps to agree to clear the feedback off my account since I was holding the item pending ebay's determination that the buyer was underage.

* I finally was able to get to the right person to investigate if the buyer was indeed underage.  He said he would have to call the buyer to ask him a set of questions ebay uses to verify age.  If he determines the buyer is underage, he will suspend the account.  

* If they are unable to contact the buyer to verify his age, it seems that I will have to ship the item to him to avoid getting a ding on my account for not shipping on time.

Ebay,Had a Rather Strange Customer Call Today,"Hey /r/ebay,

Thought some of you might be interested in a call that was escalated to me by one of our CSR's (for background here I'm the Customer Service Manager for a TRS and help run the 4 eBay accounts used to move merchandise). 

So anyway, my representative transfers me this call and tells me that ""eBay"" is on the line along WITH a customer that purchased an item from us 7 months ago. The customer is demanding they be allowed to return the item (a cellular phone) due to it's ""storage size being too low.""

I get on the line with this woman and explain our 60 day warranty policy (where we provide USPS Prepaid Shipping labels and all to ANY customer that wants to return, for ANY reason) and let her know that, unfortunately, she's outside of this warranty period.

Now here is where it got a little interesting. The woman asks the ""eBay rep"" that is in this 3 way call to tell me I have to accept the return and give her a full refund because she sent us eBay messages right when she was outside of the 60 day warranty period, and no one ever got back to her.

A man starts to talk in a thick accent confirming that she sent messages to [insertebayusernamehere] in March and did not get a response. I repeat our warranty/return policy back to both of them over the phone, and that is when the man recommends the customer open a case in the Resolution Center. 

At this point I'm a little amused, and a wee bit confused. I've heard of eBay representatives speaking with Sellers and Buyers in 3 way calls before, but never on a purchase made so long ago.

Ebay,To file a dispute or not?,"So I ordered an air dock (wireless phone charger for the car)  from eBay. Seller listed it as new. However upon receiving the item you can tell it is used as the protective wrapper (the instructional video on products website shows you need to remove it) has been removed and there is a gouge on the part that grabs the phone.

Ebay,Unfair feedback left - not sure if I have a case here,"So I sold a shirt about 2 weeks ago, and as I was packaging it, I noticed a rip in the sleeve I had not seen yet and did not disclose in the listing. I emailed the buyer and told him I will refund his money plus $5 for the inconvenience (something I do to avoid negative feedback). 

I did so the same night and then threw the shirt in the trash. He replied back ""Thanks"" the next day and a few days after that he accepted the extra $5 through Paypal. 

Today, about a week after he got my money, he leaves neutral feedback saying ""shirt was ripped."" WTF?? It was never sent to him and he made $5!? 

My question is - do I have a case for having the feedback removed? There was never a tracking number and the refund went through eBay.",8.0,7,2014-08-08,EBAY,0.18523764610290527,0.7634131908416748,0.05134914815425873
Ebay,Am I wrong in this situation or is eBay being misled?,"I will start this story by acknowledging the primary reason behind the whole problem: I am allergic to polyester. 

So I came across a t-shirt I wanted and I messaged the buyer ""Your description says this shirt is 100% cotton, can you confirm this?"" and go ahead and buy the shirt as it is a good deal and don't want someone else to snatch it. I assume that if the shirt turns out to be not 100% cotton they will let me know. But I hear nothing back from them and get the shirt in the mail a few days later. 13% polyester. Dang. 

So I message the seller without opening a case and very politely (I'm a seller, so I try my hardest to not be one of _those_ buyers) ask them to pay for my return shipping and a refund because they made the mistake of putting wrong information in the description. I will not open a case and we can move on with out lives. They fight this so very hard and take it personal that they didn't make a mistake, and I have to go as far as sending them a photo of the tag showing the issue. I wouldn't make it up, I just want the issue corrected. So finally they agree to this and say ""as long as you do not leave feedback."" I was actually going to leave good feedback originally because it was nice of them to agree. Well thankfully I did not before the next day when I received another message from them stating that they had spoken to eBay and were only going to refund the purchase price. No refund for shipping either way. 

This is when I opened a case. As soon as I opened the case I called eBay and the representative read through the messages and agreed that I was correct in that she inaccurately described her product and the case would be escalated and would be found in my favor. Well the day after I opened my case I received a full refund from her. Okay, fine. I have a full refund and a shirt I can't do anything with. Whatever, I was going to donate it to Goodwill. Case closed, or at least it should've been. A few hours later I receive this message:

We have been reviewing your purchase for the item#.  We have noticed that the seller refunded you the money and that you still have the item. Please either pay for the item to seller through PayPal to their address account or send the item back to the seller. Please do so within the next 3 days, and respond to your seller with whether you have sent the item back or the refund.

I understand this is an extremely unusual situation and can be confusing and bothersome. I sincerely appreciate your willingness to work with the seller and wish you the best in future transactions.

Thank you for your time and business with eBay!

Codie B

Now what is that even about? I am going to call tomorrow to talk with an American (nothing against the foreign workers but they're not very helpful in situations like this).

Ebay,I think I may have been scammed. HELP!!,"So, last Friday I bought a [PS4 with 7 games and 2 controllers](http://imgur.com/a9v1y38) from eBay for £250, in a purchase that now seems too good to be true. After paying for the item via the usual channel (Paypal), I received a [message](http://imgur.com/OzeA6ar) from the seller saying that I had sent to money to the wrong address and they asked me to resend the money via Paypal. To this I was rather sceptical, but my jubilation at getting a *bargain* overshadowed my pessimism and I sent the money as asked. The next day, the seller messaged me saying that he/she has sent the console First Class, despite the listing saying that it'd be sent via Economy Delivery. I thought ""great"" and then waited patiently for the postman to arrive. Then on Tuesday, I received an email through Paypal giving me a tracking number for a Parcelforce, which was the wrong amount of characters. I then tried to contact the seller to ask for some further information on the delivery, but nothing. So, a week later, I am still without my purchase and down £250. My question to you r/Ebay is: Is there anything that I can do to either get my money back or get what I paid for, given that I paid outside of Ebay?

**TL;DR: I bought a PS4 from a seller with 0 feedback, paid outside of eBay and think that I may have been scammed.**

Ebay,Seller Misrepresented Shipping?,"I used 'Buy It Now' for an Ebay auction on July 23.  After a couple days the item was still not marked as shipped so I contacted the seller twice, the second time on, (Aug 4) asking when I would receive my item (maybe they shipped it and just didn't mark it as such).

I received a response on Aug 8 saying they don't ship to Canada for free and saying they could send me an invoice for $55.12 or refund me.

The ad clearly shows shipping costs and import costs as US$ 17.69 and US$ 9.00 respectively.

My order details shows me as having paid these, which I did with VISA, on Jul 23 when I placed the order.

I have asked for a full refund for the item, $132.27 Canadian was what I paid in total for what was listed as the item as well as shipping and handling.

I am worried that the seller will not refund me fully.  How should I proceed if they do not?

Ebay,Seller deleted my winning bid because he didn't think it was high enough; sent offensive emails after I left negative feedback. How do I report him?,"I won an item on eBay. It was priced low, but fair enough. The seller had set it up so the item started at $30 for the auction price and $60 for the buy-it-now price. No one else had bid on it, so I won it for the $30. 

The seller then cancelled my winning (only) bid and then sent me like five emails in succession, saying first that he had priced it too low, then that he had priced it incorrectly, then that his *employee* had priced it incorrectly, then that his employee had been fired over this (???), and so forth.

I sent him an email asking for more clarification, and he continued to send me emails with strange excuses. So I gave him a negative rating because I don't think anyone would do well to interact with this person. (I felt bad; this is the first bad rating I've ever given to anyone.)

Anyway, now this seller is sending me offensive emails saying ""f*** you! The devil's going to come get you! He curses you!"" and so forth.

I mainly sell Nutritional Supplements (Protein Power, etc) and was doing really well for 3 months, got my Top Seller and Power Seller.  

Word got out to my Friends that I had a selling discount, and the USPS discount, so they started asking me to sell their things for them instead of having a Garage Sale.  

I put on some clothes, coins, makeup, etc.  

Apparently, my ""Makeup"" listing got flagged.  

eBay contacted me asking me to verify all of my personal information (ID, Utility Bill, and Invoices/Receipts from my suppliers)


For the Protein Powders and 99% of my Sales, I have a Resale Certificate, I have all the receipts, and I have everything in order and organized.  

The coins and makeup were just things I threw up as favors for friends.  I gave them cash, there's no ""Paper Trail.""

Ebay,YOUR OPINION: Buyer demanding refund for express shipping.,"I sold an item Wednesday night and the buyer selected the USPS Priority Express shipping option. He left a note on the purchase asking that I ship it that night (lol) and told me that ""it said it would be here tomorrow."" It's worth noting that I charge the raw cost for express shipping, which is about 15 bucks. 

He messages me again at 9:30AM the next morning asking me to hurry up and ship the item. I respond kindly, telling him that his item will go out today as stated in the listing.

I print the label and it says USPS PRIORITY EXPRESS 2-DAY, I knew instantly that there would be problems ahead. Took it up to the USPS and made sure to get the acceptance scan right away.

Skip ahead two days, the guy messages me demanding a refund for shipping as the item had not arrived yet, accuses me of not shipping it out in time, says he's going to contact eBay if I don't refund, etc. I check tracking and it says it's at the hub nearest to him and will be delivered Monday - AHHHHHH. 

I call eBay and get an American who advises me not to refund his shipping cost. She also states that she is going to report him on their internal systems (yea ok.) 

I message him back stating very politely that the item was shipped and scanned in the next day, I appreciate his purchase, etc. He responds with ""Your high. You charge $15 for shipping and it doesn't arrive in two days thats ridiculous."" Funny thing is, I look at his listings and he just charged somebody $11 to ship a hat via ground. 

I think I'm playing this optimally by denying the refund, but would like your opinion. If he negs for shipping speed I can easily get that removed. If I were to refund this buyer, he might be the type of person to leverage that and demand partial refunds for other things. If he displayed any sort of logic I would have instantly sent the $15 back to him.",6.0,4,2014-08-10,EBAY,0.041018035262823105,0.9243058562278748,0.03467608988285065

Ebay,Is there an advantage to timing my auctions to end on certain days or times?,"I've started to time the bulk of my auctions to end Sunday nights around 9-11 PM eastern time (I'm a U.S. seller). The logic behind this is it seems to be a day and time that the majority of people are home. The 9-11 PM time makes sense in that it ends at a time when the most amount of people would be in front of a computer (early enough for the east coast to still be awake and late enough that the west coast would be winding down from their day). 
I've noticed a small rise in my sales in the two months I've been doing this. Is this just a coincidence or is there a benefit to having auctions end on certain days or times? 
The reason I ask is because I have a few people I sell for that I made the mistake of telling this theory to who now want everything to end Sunday night around 10 o'clock.",3.0,3,2014-08-10,EBAY,0.0343194380402565,0.9041269421577454,0.06155360862612724
Ebay,Buyers having to pay for package upon arrival?,"Ok so I have been selling for about 6 months, 200 items...mostly clothing with very little problems. I usually ship First Class in my own poly mailers but jeans and whatnot go USPS Priority by weight. I get my eBay discount and it's $4.95 Flat Rate Envelope. I have always used the USPS supplied envelopes from my post office. They are the OD:11.625 x 15.125 size but I fold them over and tape them with heavy-duty tape to ensure that the fit the right size requirements. I take extra special care to make sure there are no flaps or loose tape to get stuck on sorting machinery.  I have done this over 100 times with no issues. Keep in mind there is a 70lb weight limit and Im at the most 2 lbs on my heaviest shipment.

Anyways twice in the past month I have gotten messages from buyers who claim they had to pay around $5 at the time of delivery to the postman. I cannot understand why this would happen and what could be different? I have refunded their shipping plus  what they claimed to have paid the postman. 

Both incidents have came from high feed back sellers (500+ positive feedback) so I highly doubt I am being scammed, just don't understand what happened. 

Are these podunk mailmen getting a ruler out and measuring my package and looking for any issues? I have always used eBay's shipping service and tape my labels perfectly. The money has always came out of my Paypal no problem.

Does anybody have any info on what could've went wrong? I don't know what to do and I really want to make sure all my buyers are happy.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Ebay,Sold a working Xbox and now the buyer is saying it's not working. What should I do? Am I being scammed?,"Sold an Xbox 360 in a bundle with a few games, controller and a  rechargeable batter+cable. Before I shipped it out I tested it for everything. Made sure the tray opened/closed, controllers were working and battery was charging. This was the message they put in their case:

&gt; 
My husband and I waited an extra week for the package to arrive. When we got it we immediately set it up to make sure it was working properly, but thereve been many issues including: red-eyed plug (overheats easily, so my guess is the fan isn't working), one of the controllers will barely hook up and its ""rechargeable battery"" won't charge what-so-ever, and it takes ten minutes to get the scanner to read (it just says ""open tray"", not ""play game"") each time we put in something different or the console turns off.

First of all the shipping ""issue"" is a lie and I have the tracking to prove it. They bought the item on July 28th (Monday) at 11pm, I shipped the item on August 1st (Friday) and the item was delivered on August 4th (Monday) for a total of 1 week or 5 business days.

I can't say for certain about the fan issue. The console was working when I tested it before packing it up though. The controller was working as well as the rechargeable battery+cable because I had to plug them in to format my HDD. The tray issue also isn't true because before I packaged it, I had a game in the tray that I had to take out and put in its case.

I messaged them back with a nicer explanation than the one above ending with me saying that *""The listing stated no refunds because I was confident that it was working. Before I packaged it I tested it. I don't believe a refund is valid unless you provide photographic proof of your claims along with the serial numbers for the items.""""*

Now. I'm aware of the scam where you sell a working Xbox, the buyer says it's not working and send you back a defective Xbox with the problems they listed. Does this sound like the case? Luckily I kept the serial number because you need it in order to format the hard drive. However, I don't want to have to deal with them sending it to me only to see that the Xbox is different and I have to pay to ship it back. Any advice on what I should do?

Ebay,"Lost case, Buyer at fault and he admitted it in the correspondence.","Sold a Motherboard and CPU on Ebay and the buyer claimed it was faulty. He asked for a refund before even shipping the items back. I told him to return the items and I will test it, if its faulty I will refund him in full, including the postage he paid to ship it back. He demanded the refund regardless faulty or not.

I received the item back with the Thermal Interface Material scattered around the motherboard and gone inside the memory sockets. I replied in the dispute that the TIM was everywhere and the buyer ADMITTED that he left it on the CPU prior to shipping.
I told him that I couldn't test the items in its unfit state and that I couldn't issue a refund and would let Ebay handle the case.

He supplied a tracking number that didn't work but I received the items back. - How did this even slip through the system?

Anyway, Ebay refunded the buyer and left me with this mess. He left me a Positive too!

Ebay,Resolving Account Suspension,"Hi,
I'm currently in contact with eBay attempting to resolve this issue. But they don't seem to be giving me any straight answers at the moment. I'm hoping people here might have some experience and can help me get to the bottom of it.

Last week I started a new seller account. I have a primary account that I've had for many years and have a relatively high rating on. This first account is typically used for selling used video games and buying whatever I buy. I want to sell a few items that are more ""adult"" in nature. You might understand that I don't want these associated with my regular account, so I started a new one and attached it to the same PayPal account as the existing one. I made my first listing and within an hour received a notification from ebay that my listing had been removed and my account had been restricted. They cited my recent account activity as the reason. When I contacted them they said I needed further verification. But when I pursued this they refused to give further details.

A few days ago now I received a new notification stating my account has now been suspended due to severe security concerns. I've contacted them regarding this for further details and a resolution, but have not yet received a response.

I really don't know the reason for all of this and why they won't give me a straight response. Might it be because of the adult content? There are many other sellers on ebay offering items of an adult nature. Why would mine be targeted for suspension? Might it be because I have two accounts attached to the same PayPal account? I'm not attempting to circumvent any seller limits or anything like that. The thought never even crossed my mind until a friend mentioned it. I simply want to keep these items isolated from my primary account as my primary sales are video games. I don't want younger people buying my games to stumble across these items.

Ebay,Shipped Gold Coin Buyer Says Nothing in Box Scam Update/Assistance?,"The other day I posted here about selling a gold coin on eBay. Basically I sold a 1/10th Gold coin to a buyer through BuyItNow. Buyer paid immediately as required and I shipped the following day. I shipped via USPS First Class in a unmarked 6x6x6 box, no insurance. I produced label via stamps.com with postage paid hidden.

Buyer received package and immediately opened case saying nothing in box. Buyer has about 500 feedback all positive, I have about 950 fb with 2 negs and 2 neut over last 12 months.

I tell him to please check again.

Buyer responded next day saying he looked and for sure no coin.

I then ask him if there was anything in the box other than packing material.

Buyer responds angrily saying I've already asked this question - to which I reply ""we put packing slips in every package, was there a slip in there?""

Buyer responds with very negative, you're fucking me kind of response. Says he contacted Post Office and they told him I didn't get insurance on the package. Says Post Office told him to call police.

Is this possible? Would USPS tell a shipping recipient that the package they received did not have insurance? I never told this person there was no insurance.

More or less I am going to lose $170 and eBay has told me to expect this as a normal part of doing business and to refund the money which is bullshit.

I understand if the guy really received an empty box but this is a very common scam and I'm very confident he's scamming.

Why would they tell me outright he knows I didn't pay insurance? How could they know that?

Ebay,"Seller claimed to be located in Belize, but the shipping indicates it shipped from New York. Item was over 3 weeks late. Suspicious?","Hello everyone.

I purchased an item on ebay July 6th. I chose the buy now option, only to realize afterwards that the seller was located in Belize.

The estimated shipment time was July 16th - 20th.

I opened a case Friday because the item had still not been delivered.

Low and behold, the item arrived this weekend. The postage says it was shipped out August 8th, from New York.

So what gives? Shouldn't the item have had Belize postage?

Is this seller trying to con his buyers? Because international sellers have a much much longer waiting period (30 days) before a buyer can open a case against them.

He wouldn't reply to any messages, and has yet to respond to the case.

In the time that it took the item to deliver, I purchased the identical item from a domestic seller, and received it around July 13th. So I now have no use for this item.

Ebay,Do I have a right to open a case against this person,"I bought an expensive piece of clothing from someone which was a black cape on eBay. He showed how the cape looked like and it looked pretty nice and he also had a stock photo of the cape.

When I got the cape I was disappointed because the cape in the stock photo didn't match the one I got. So I contacted the seller and asked for a refund but he said he wouldn't do a refund but he would help me sell it. In the process he gave me a fashion runway photo of the cape that looked more identical to the cape I bought and I tried to sell it. I kinda felt ripped off with the stock photo because the cape is all black and it's tricky to get a visual of it. All the pictures he posted on the eBay listing were fine except for the stock photo.

So I tried to sell it with the real fashion runway photo plus the photos of the cape he used because he gave me permission and it wouldn't sell for a few weeks and the real photos don't look as appealing so I decided to open a case to try to get my money back by explaining my whole problem.


So the guy is mad that I opened a case because all the pictures he provided were fine and because we talked about it through eBay messenger but I still felt cheated and since I couldn't get my money back and just forget about it by selling it I wanted to open a case on it.

Ebay,Please help me how to resolve my issue. Buyer says the package arrived empty. I have doubts,"Hi. I guess I am in a pretty bad situation. I'll try to give as much information as possible

I sold an item to a buyer. It was display assembly for Macbook air for  GBP 199. I accepted his offer of GBP 170. However, I went on holiday but of course I contacted the buyer if he was ok If I sent it after I returned. He agreed

So, I come back and it takes quite a number of messages to get him pay for the item. He pays almost 3 weeks after the end date of the listing. We agreed that he will pay after 9 days. When he pays, I send the item using a registered method to another country, from Czech Republic to United Kingdom. To my surprise, It only took 2 days for the package to arrive.

Today, the buer wrote to me, that the package arrived empty and that it has been probably tampered with as the tape was peeled off. I used quite a heavy duty tape to seal the box, although I have to admit that I could do a better job at wrapping it up. However, in my opinion, it was all well packed.

The buyer also told me, that he wanted to NOT accept the parcel and that the postman didn't even ask for a sign, although it was a sent by a registered method. How is that possible. There is something fishy going on here. 

Either the post office messed up big time in my or his country or the seller is trying to scam me. I assume that, because he was quite reluctant to pay in the first place, and I had to give him a push. 

In either case, what can I do? Thanks!",8.0,8,2014-08-15,EBAY,0.032870154827833176,0.9195706844329834,0.04755915328860283

I call the number eBay provides, and he is extremely surprised that I was able to reach him and then says he accidentally bought my item. I say that's okay and to just ship it back and I'll pay the shipping costs. Then, he says he doesn't even live at the address he provided -- that it's an old address, so he can't even ship it back. 

The thing is that the package shows as Delivered from the tracking number. The address he provided is at an apartment complex, so I've been trying to get hold of the management and request that they get in contact with whoever lives in the apartment he 'accidentally' entered, and ask them to get in contact with me.

Ebay,Guy trying to get a partial refund,"Ok so basically I sent out several items to this buyer some fairly cheap controllers for 70 dollars for all 3.

Now he received the item and basically he messaged me saying he would like a partial refund because the controllers are damaged.  

I offered him a full refund if he sent the controllers back which he then told me the controllers weren't damaged but the boxes were damaged in freight.  Now these are some  shitty boxes which he claims he wants to display and are very important to him (lol)  http://mariio128.com/images/detailed/3/buffalo_nes_controller-3.jpg


So I offered to send him some boxes that weren't damaged and that isn't acceptable either.  He wants a 25% refund otherwise he will give me negative feedback for improper packaging.

I basically reported him straight to ebay and told him to bugger off.  What are the chances of ebay actually removing the negs he is giving me?  Or ebay making me refund him money?

Ebay,Scammer keeps stalling in dispute resolution process. How do I get my money back?,"This is such an open shut case, it isn't even funny.  I ordered something August 3rd (2 weeks ago), and the seller never shipped anything for 2 weeks.  (It was an 80 dollar hard drive).  I thought something fishy was going on, so I checked his feedback, and he received 2 other very recent negative feedback of not shipping items .  I think the original seller had his ebay account hacked and he started listing high priced electronic items (in lots) etc... = typical hacked account listing.  I got tricked because his seller rating was pretty high.

Anyway, I opened up a dispute resolution with eBay and eBay won't let me escalate it to the review process because the seller keeps replying with bullshit.  For example, he posted a USPS shipping receipt, but it is obviously invalid and the USPS says it is not valid or shipped.  I already called up my credit card company to dispute the charge, and created a negative feedback to the seller, but is there anyway to escalate this to ebay?

The seller keeps responding and posting fake information (saying that the Post Office had shipped it at yada yada) while the tracking # he provided is invalid.  Then he is making veiled threats on me.

And stupid ebay doesn't allow me anyway to stop this.

This my first time posting in this subreddit so I apologise if I am in the wrong place.

The tracking number referenced in the email matches the tracking number I was giving during the eBay transaction.

Ebay,Item sold New With Tags and it's far from it,"I mostly sell on eBay and all of my dealings on eBay usually go without any issues. Recently, I bought an expensive purse listed as NWT for 35.00 with shipping, original retail was about $140 for the purse, so I was getting a good deal. Although I was buying from a seller who had no feedback (new to ebay) I chalked up getting the purse due to the fact she didn't have it listed very well and the auction was ending very late at night, so it didn't get the proper exposure. Her pictures were fine, description included dimensions, and repeated that it was an unused item. 

Got the item in the mail yesterday- packaged poorly, and I immediately notice fading of the canvas of the exterior. I then open the purse, and see all this dirt and grime in it, a stain, and then I smell that the purse reeks of cigarette smoke. So I message the seller nicely and ask for a refund, she agrees, then I ask for return shipping and she adamantly refuses, becoming nasty and name calling, saying she is doing a refund only out of the ""goodness of her heart"" and I caused all this damage to the purse because it was NWT when she shipped it off... yeah right. 

Open a case with eBay, if she doesn't want to pay return shipping I'll have them, I would have never bought a purse that smells like smoke. I could get over the fading or stain, but smoke smell is unacceptable.

Ebay,Going on Day 8 of my Selling Restriction...Any advice would be gladly welcomed.,"Here's my original [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/2d6hka/temporary_selling_restriction/) for last week.  

Where I stand right now:

- I've called eBay about 2-3 times, each time speaking to probably a Low Level Representative.  Each time they've told me to fax in More Documentation (Seemed like a script they were reading/following)

- I'm still able to sell what I have listed, just no new items, and I cannot change price or quantity on what I have listed.  


I'm not sure exactly what to think at this point.  I assumed, worst case scenario, it would be a 7 day thing and now it's carrying over into Week 2 and I still have had no timetable presented to me.  

The fact that I'm still able to sell, to some degree, is a good sign, I believe.  

At this point, they have EVERYTHING that I would be able to provide, from a documentation standpoint, and I've thoroughly made my case in my email/cover letter.  


Is this going to just remain in a Temporary State forever?  Is someone actually going to make a decision?  Should I call and request a supervisor?

I do not want to pester them, but the situation seems pretty cut and dry to me.  

I'm a really NEW Seller.  I'm killing it with sales and satisfaction numbers.  Everything I sell has a Paper Trail (Supplement Related).  I just so happened to make 1 bonehead decision (Listing items for a friend that are at risk for being counterfeit), albeit a big bonehead decision.  When presented with this restriction, I've done everything in my power to comply (Spend 2 hours on hold to have eBay cancel all listings that I did not have a receipt for)


Putting myself in their Customer Service Supervisors Shoes, I'd look at my account, and, although I wouldn't be happy with the Questionable Listing, I'd see the potential for income, and give myself the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe keep a close eye on my Sales and Listings for a few months.

so bought a chassis for R/C car project I am working on, well its a Mouse Droid from Star Wars. Finally found one for the perfect price so I bid and won.

I get a email saying that the item has been relisted because its been 5 days. because the item when I orignally won it ended at 9 pm. so I said fine I will pay right now, he pretty much didn't care and said good luck next time and enjoy the negative feedback.

Ebay,I'm obsessed with eBay,"I love ebay but I get an unhealthy obsession with it.

When I want to buy something from there, I maniacally search every iteration of the item I can think of, as well as use typo websites that search for typos to get better deals. Then when I add something to my watch list I check it frequently, even if it doesn't end for 3-5 days, just to make sure no one has bid on it. I even look at sold listings of the item and get upset when it sold for a great price earlier and get upset at myself for not looking for it earlier. I send multiple messages to sellers meticulously checking every aspect of their item. And then I participate in the practice of not bidding on something until like 5 minutes before it ends which  adds to the problems

Ebay,Sold Gold Coin Buyer Says Nothing in Box Update Pt.3 FINAL OUTCOME!,"This has been the craziest case I've ever been involved in. 

Earlier this month I sold a gold coin. Listing set up as BIN with immediate payment required. Buyer paid for coin, $170 - I shipped next day. Shipped via USPS First Class in box with no insurance. Buyer received package and immediately opened SNAD case and says there was no coin in the box. 

I respond and tell him to please check the box again, just to make sure its not tucked away somewhere in the box. Buyer says sure thing, nothing in box. 

I then contact police in their city, who tell me to contact police in my city as there is nothing they can do. The police in my city say there is nothing they can do and tell me its up to USPS.

USPS tells me to call Lost and Found and USPS consumer affairs. 

I submit mail theft claim via USPS Postal Inspectors thanks to link provided by redditor. (Thanks again dude!)

I advise buyer to open a mail theft case as well because apparently their mail was stolen. Buyer responds and basically says ""I could be lying if I open mail theft case because what if you didn't put the coin in the box and mailed it to me empty on purpose.""

Buyer gets crazy hostile and accuses us of deceiving them and doing this to scam them. Buyer refuses to open theft case. 

Buyer then sends taunting email telling me to open a case with eBay. They have been on eBay for 11 years so they know a seller cannot open any case. 

I then go through ALL of their feedback and the feedback left for others, 500+, and begin to find multiple cases similar to this. 

I contact (called) eBay six times total and am told to report buyer for this behavior. I'm told that if they see anything fishy they will investigate him. 

SO - buyer escalates the case. I call eBay and beg for more time to hear back from Postal Inspectors. I am told I will be given extra time. 

Today, I discover I am not given extra time.

eBay FINDS CASE IN FAVOR OF THE BUYER. FUCK. This can't be right. I'm out $170. 

But wait....

I look at the buyers feedback to leave a false positive feedback because I'm angry and not thinking straight. The buyer is no longer a registered user. 

????? 

I call eBay immediately and after a bit on hold I talk to CSR. CSR rep tells me - welp, looks like the case was decided before the buyer was banned from eBay. 

CSR then tells me she is going to reverse the decision as the buyer lost his buyer protection when his account was banned. 

TL;DR - 

Buyer tried to pull nothing in the box scam. I reported him for fraudulent behavior. Case decided in buyer's favor then reversed when I contacted eBay about his account being banned.

Ebay,Not good to like like a dealer or pro trader?,"EDIT: Sorry, title should be ""look like""

Hello all! My first post here on /r/ebay. Just wondering if others had the same experiences or observations.

I've long advocated fancy-schmancy slick well-designed listings. I'm no longer a heavy eBay user, but have slowly started up again as I do a reorg of all the stuff I own and have collected through the years, and my previous experience was I did better with the fancy slick listings.

Well, here's what I've noticed of late: The few times I've done slick listings and looked like a dealer, more often than not, I get one of those ""discount scammers"" - complaining about some dumb thing and demanding a discount. Hasn't worked with me, because I don't care about the implied threats, use lots of pictures, point out the ""AS-IS, no returns"" policy. They usually argue back with some totally whacko irrelevant complaint (usually some made up, even senseless, defect). It's when I reply, ""Hey, _I'm not a dealer_, the pics are the exact item you got, can't be anything else because _I don't have anything else_, I don't believe a single word you're saying, so basically, stuff it,"" I never hear back from them again.

No losses from that BS yet, but I find it irksome. Especially when i think about the dealers that may just automatically give those discounts. and how much this deceitful buyer practice is costing. (And what is eBay doing about it?)

On the other hand, when I do a basic text listing, ugly as sin, sometimes rushed with typos and all... no problems whatsoever.

Looks like I have to stop telling people to take the time to fancy up. Thoughts?

On a related aside: I don't usually do international orders and just ship to US addresses. Just a hassle, international shipping. But decided to test it one weekend.

Some guy from Singapore won not one, but two separate items I had up for sale. He paid for one, not the other, wanted me to send both combined. ""Nope,"" said I, ""you haven't paid for the other item yet."" No response for a few days. So I shipped just the first item, sent demand notices for the second, yada yada.

A number of days later, I get the discount scam. This time with a specific amount requested, since he claims to have sent the item out ""for repair"" (it was a camera lens)  and that's how much it supposedly cost. Basically just told him to screw off. And he never did pay for that second item.

Yup, as you may have guessed, fancy listing. Also, this has strengthened my resolve to _never_ do international shipping again. Just thought I'd throw this little anecdotal addendum into this post FYI...",11.0,2,2014-08-20,EBAY,0.10996317118406296,0.8630859851837158,0.026950886473059654

Ebay,So today I learned that the return policy you list on your items holds zero value.,"So, here is my first post in /r/ebay. I had to come take a look, cause I was flabbergasted by what I learned today. What I discovered through discussions with eBay and PayPal is that the terms you put in the returns policy of your listing hold absolutely zero merit except in terms of feedback.

Financially, it means nothing. No Returns? Buyer pays return shipping? Restocking fee? All meaningless, because PayPal doesn't care about your return policy. If the buyer does anything where they don't end up with the item in their hand, they will get a 100% refund.

If you ship an item exactly as described with a no-return policy and they refuse the shipment, even though UPS shows that it was refused by the buyer, they will get a full refund. If your return policy states that your buyer pays return shipping and a 15% restocking fee, you will not get your restocking fee and you will not get compensated for the return shipping. In fact, I was told by PayPal that even if they amicably return the item, they can file a complaint for the restocking fee and recover that after the fact.

I was quite honestly blown away when I had all of my ducks in a row, proof of shipping, tracking, refusal, that the item was completely 100% as described, that they were able to get a full refund on a no-return item.

Why does ebay bother with requiring certain return standards on listings for Top Seller status if the requirements are absolutely meaningless? I don't need to offer 14 day hassle free returns, its already a guaranteed service through PayPal. Even buyers remorse is covered!

Ebay,I am worried about my top seller rating because of buyers errors.,"Hello,

I am new to ebay and I was doing pretty good as a seller until. 
Buyers started opening cases and nuteral rating edging me close to loosing my top seller rating.

3 of the buyers confirmed that they opened cases by accident because they didnt know how to contact me.

I was under the impression that they will go away after my next review.

I was wrong they are sitting there and I am one case away from loosing my top seller rating.

It is really bothering me more than it should what can I do about this?

Another thing I dont understand is that ebay using the number of transactions to calculate the above standard rating is far lower than actual transactions.

Thank you for you comments and help in advance.

Ebay,"What's with all the ""charity/donation"" listings? Is this a new trend?","I was searching for a PS4, and I sorted the listings by newest first.

Hopefully the buyer doesn't get duped out of their money.

Ebay,Question regarding international shipments and Ebay hub.,"So I bought my first ever item on Ebay and was tickled pink when I noticed the seller used 2 day priority USPS shipping.

Ebay,encountered a buyer with no feedback - the sell is giving me a headache. what should I do?,"so this isn't the first 0 feedback new buyer I've encountered but this one's giving me a problem.

the buyer ""bought"" my $80 printer toner cartridge a couple of days ago and paid instantly via paypal. so far so good. a few hours later I go to print the shipping label (and I do this through usps.com not eBay's app because they have some weird package dimensions and charge more). good that I did this. the address comes up ""non-deliverable"" and it won't print the label. first time I've seen this.

so I think typo maybe on the part of the buyer? so I send ""her"" a message via eBay's contact buyer app. ""please confirm address make sure no typos blah blah blah"". no answer in over 24 hrs. (I check my email every 10min so WTF don't people check theirs?) today I click the email that's stipulated in the paypal address and send her a direct email from my own email (outside ebay) ""please contact me [username] on ebay to confirm address regarding cartridge purchase within 3 business days"". the email comes back as delivery status notification failure.

what the hell man!

Ebay,Using Auction Templates or Not - Related to cases and messages from buyers,"Hi all,

I know that this as come out a few times but I really dont want to know if they work better for sales or not. That for me deppends on the type of article - IMO if it is a used shirt, it will work better the non template as the user will relate it to a personal seller and get a better offer, if a new Blu-Ray, a templated listing will give the buyer a more professional look and give him more confidence. And at the end each one will have they own opinion and experience.

What really is my question is related to the number or questions, returns and cases the templated auction/sale will atract vs the non templated.

In my case, I do not use templated listings (I do in the other end have well formated text descriptions)  and I get a LOT of questions, a LOT of returns and all kind of problems. I sell some very particular phone accessories that need configuration and as we all know, everyone is a genius that have the power of knowing how to install everything - so it gives me a lot of work to reply and help all the genius out there that at firsrt dont accept that they did something wrong.

Do you fellow redditors think that changing to a tempalted listing will help? I'm thinking if it is a templated listing the seller should be a pro and I really should re-read to know if I'm doing something wrong.

I dont sell a lot on the eBay, but comparing the tickets/cases/messages open in the places I sell, eBay clearlly wins.

Example: for every 10 articles sold on my website I get 2 mails and normally they are asking for delivery updates, eventually there is a support one. On Amazon I only have received 2 questions in the last month (with around 40 orders). In ebay... for every article sold I get 4 messages!

Please share your opinion as I'm considering stop selling in eBay due to this (time wasted, returns, DSR etc)

2. Buyer opens INAD case on the UK eBay site. Calls me ""dear"", tells me they are leaving the country and need to return item ASAP, etc. 
3. Buyer orders a sample cologne from fragrancex.com and ships it to my house.
4. I receive cologne, call fragrancex.com and ask them why they are sending me this crap - they have no clue and won't tell me who ordered it. 
5. Cologne is crap and I am oblivious so I throw it away along with the packaging. 
6. Fast forward two weeks, buyer uploads tracking from the sample cologne order to resolution center and escalates.

For kicks, I googled the guys name and verified that he has multiple arrests on file for threatening to murder and kill a corporate company's CEO &amp; family. He sent these emails from a library and they traced them down and arrested the guy. Further, he has a litigious background and has sued more than 1 person and company, and the filings are all available online.

Now, Before I call eBay sounding like a looney bin, what do I do?! Do I even call eBay and bring this up to them?

I usually call people directly when they open eBay cases against our company (using the phone # on file), but I absolutely DO NOT want anything to do with this person. I am scared on what to do next given this person's history.

Is this allowed?  Do I have to pay any tax for selling an item in the US?  Do I have to say or declare anything differently at the border?

If anyone has any insight on this, please advise.

Ebay,Cheap/free shipping. Why? How?!,"I been really considering unloading my old Xbox 360 games, liquidating at the mercy of the free market, but in an effort to get the most buck for my bang, I need to consider the shipping and packaging costs to be the biggest expense variable--one that could potentially end up costing instead of profiting.

So, browsing around the eBays, I see that there are a lot of weird things going on, possibly behind the scenes.

How is it that people can sell a one penny Magic: the Gathering card with free shipping? (It's a land card, by the way, which I would assume is not even worth the price of half a penny)

I also see international items from Japan being listed for one cent, free shipping.

So then my inquisitive mind brings me to search for ""forever stamps,"" and I find that some stamps are going for about 40 cents, plus an additional 10 cents shipping (at 49 cents at the Post Office, plus about a dollar in gas, I'd also save money here, while someone else is profiting a whopping penny).

So, can anyone explain to me what's *really* going on here? Is there a way to ship things dirt cheap in the mail that most of the general population does not know about? Are they doing it to fuel their eBay user rating? Are there really people spending countless hours selling things for a penny of profit and taking a 50 cent loss because there are actually good Samaritans out there that just feel good helping others out at the end of the day?",8.0,4,2014-08-25,EBAY,0.0282130129635334,0.9266350269317627,0.04515203461050987

July 28 -- Won the auction for ~600 EUR

July 29 -- The ""selller"" reminded me to pay via paypal.

July 30 -- Payed full price with shipping via ebay's buy now button. (paypal)

Aug  07 -- I opened a case since he stopped communicating with me and he left me in the dark about the status of the item.

I haven't received any tracking number, nor any confirmation from the ""seller"" if he shipped it or not.
The estimated delivery according to ebay was the first week of August. I didn't receive anything.
I've been trying to call the support line (I managed to get into the wait line on the phone with my minimal German language knowledge), I waited 1 hour then I hung up.
Since then he received a negative feedback, from a very similar item (almost same device, buyer complained about not responding to emails).

**For some reason ebay just closed my case against him not shipping the item.** I haven't received any contact from ebay nor the ""seller"". The most frustrating part is that I know that the time is ticking, and I'm running out of the buyers protection time.

What the hell should I do? 
Oh, and ebay won't let me open another case against him in the same category (didn't receive item)

Usually i will research everything i put on, last night i was rushing, so no research went into the listing.

My partner researched this morning and tells me raise the shirt to $50 and not take less than $40.

Ebay,"And with this curt message, years of being TSR came to an end.","&gt; Dear XXXXX,
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, your account no longer meets the eBay Top-rated seller requirements under the UK seller performance standards program. To learn more, go to your Seller Dashboard. 
&gt; 
&gt; Visit your Seller Dashboard and review the Top-rated seller requirements and see how your eBay business measures up. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you again for selling on eBay. We hope to welcome you back to Top-rated seller status soon.

And the reason it no longer meets them? Out of nearly 300 sales of laptops and parts I had 3 sales of laptop keys where people bought keys it clearly stated were not available and four sales where despite it clearly stating to check the part number and the photo of the clip they didn't bother at all and all filed NAD when they bought the wrong thing making me 0.8% over the level for TSR even though they'd all been refunded. 

I'll be closing the account. Taking control of returns is being taken out of the hands of the seller. Here in the UK we're also being forced to use the equivalent of sending something to Walmart for a customer to collect from there as an option in the next couple of weeks with them having a week to do so or it gets automatically returned and refunded so I'm not guaranteed the money from the sale for at least a week even though I've held up my end of the deal. 

No longer interested in jumping through the hoops and being penalised even though I go above and beyond.

Ebay,Package arrived in a damage box?,"I'm not quite sure what to do here: I recently purchased something that was shipped through the global shipping program, and the box arrived damaged. In fact, it looks like someone along the shipping route purposely cut out a large corner of the box it was shipped in to inspect the contents.

Who should I contact about a problem like this? Do I have to go through the seller as my first point of communication? I am pretty certain this damage is entirely the global shipping programs fault, but I may be wrong. I don't want to inconvenience the seller if it is likely to be their fault.

The actual goods described in the auction arrived in good condition, but the empty box itself holds significant value and often sells on eBay empty for around 30 dollars. I can't think of a good example, but I would compare it to very old soda can/bottles, vintage video game boxes or an empty wine bottle from a very desirable and expensive vintage.

Does this kind of complaint have any merit? I know it sounds ridiculous to be asking this over some flimsy cardboard packaging, but this is a rare and expensive collectible, the packaging is very much non-trivial in value.

EDIT: I just noticed the empty Mac box thread on the front page of this subreddit. I just want to make it clear that this isn't a xbox 360 box or something.

Ebay,Can the image of a listing be changed after purchase?,"So I've been in the market for a genuine Wii U Pro Controller on eBay. The listings have been saturated with generic controllers, but after much patience I found a controller from a vendor in China who had some 20 in stock for cheap... Yes, I was skeptical. The image showed a controller branded with Nintendo's logo, model number, etc. with grey cord that also appeared to be branded with the Nintendo logo. Under the  manufacturer name it said ""Nintendo"". I purchased it, waited the 3 weeks, and what arrived is a complete counterfeit. The worst part is that when I go to review my purchase history, it takes me to the current product listing, which has since been drastically changed... the image shows a blatant generic, and it no longer says ""Nintendo"" as the manufacturer. 

I had thought that the purchase history was supposed to show listings exactly as they were shown when purchased. I see either one of two scenarios... either a) I purchased this obviously generic controller in a fugue state after being so careful for weeks of patience and years of eBaying, or b) the description page is totally different now than it was. 

I contacted the seller and explained that this product is not as described, requested a refund and funding necessary to return the item to China. I'm guessing I'm screwed though... I'm probably going to have to ship this thing back to China if I want my $20 back, right? Am I protected in any way?

Ebay,"Seller violated terms, sold the item to someone else, and has somehow removed my negative feedback and left negative feedback disguised as positive. eBay customer service has given conflicting and erroneous advice, I’m at a loss. What do?","This is my very first post on Reddit. I’ve mostly lurked on other subs but have finally created an account because I’m at a loss and there’s nowhere else I can find any help. 

Here's what happened: 

* I made a “best offer” for an item three weeks ago, and the seller accepted. He sent an invoice that seemed pretty high, and upon further examination, he had doubled the shipping charges and added a $3 “extra charge” on top of that.

* I asked him to clarify these extra charges, and he told me the extra shipping was for another item I had previously messaged him about with a question (but I never put an offer in for!) PLUS the item he had just accepted my offer for, and that the $3 charge was his “handling fee”. I ask him where in the listing this “handling fee” was, and whether he could invoice me again with the correct shipping price.

* Not two minutes later, I get several angry messages calling me a lowlife, a lowballer, scum, cheapass.  I message back because I was honestly just shocked and confused, and asked him why he accepted the offer if he thought it was too low in the first place. He responds simply telling me not to buy the item.

* I call eBay, and apprise them of the situation. The representative I get is sympathetic and reports the seller for violation of eBay policy, and that they do not take situations like this lightly. I am also told NOT to pay this invoice, and to wait for the investigation to do its work. 

* Two days later, the item is relisted for 2/3rds of the price. I call eBay, and am once again told to wait for this investigation and to NOT pay this invoice. I keep repeating that all I want is to be able to pay what I agreed to, and for the item to be sent to me within the time frame listed in the original ad. 

* The item sells four days later. I call eBay, asking what I can do now. Nothing, they say, they can’t compel the seller to sell this item to me now that it’s been sold to someone else. I once again tell them that all I wanted was the item. I am encouraged to leave negative feedback, and to not pay the invoice. 

* I contemplate leaving negative feedback for a week, and finally do it two days ago. I did *not* allude to any investigations or otherwise break the rules when doing so – this has been confirmed by yet another eBay representative I spoke to today. 

* The seller sends me a message today asking me to revise my negative feedback, and follows it with an unpaid buyer claim, since – on the advice of several eBay reps – I did not pay for the item. 

* I call eBay… again, reiterating that all I wanted was to pay for the item at the price I and the seller agreed to. I am assured that once this unpaid buyer claim has closed, they will remove the strike on my account since it was not my fault I was unable to pay for the item at the price listed.

* I look at the seller’s feedback, and my negative has disappeared. I call eBay AGAIN, and am told that the negative feedback was removed because I had not paid for the item, and that this would be permanent and I would be unable to leave more feedback. I am incredulous at this point – I was told not to pay for the item AND to leave negative feedback, and this has somehow resulted in my feedback being removed?!?!?!

* I ask what would happen if I paid this invoice. I am told that the unpaid buyer claim would automatically close, and that my feedback would reappear. Despite being perfectly polite and conversational during this whole ordeal, I am accused by the eBay rep of just wanting revenge because there’s no way this item is getting to me anyway. The rep takes my shocked silence as the end of the conversation and hangs up on me. 

* At this point, I panic and pay the invoice – extra charges included. I had been told that there would be no strike against me once the case closed, but I had also been given all sorts of advice from eBay reps which ended up with me having no recourse whatsoever, so I was afraid that the case would close and I would end up not only being unable to leave well-deserved negative feedback, but that I would also end up with a permanent strike, and that eBay would renege on their promise to remove it. 

* The payment goes through, at which point the seller leaves a “false positive” on my feedback thread accusing me of being abusive and manipulative and “gaming the eBay system”. 

* The seller then emails me and “offers me a full refund”. I check my email and he has refunded my payment in full. I reiterate, once again, that I would really just prefer the item, but if that’s not possible, I’d like it if he sent me a cancellation request. 

* The seller gleefully sends a message back saying “of course, I’ve already sent it, let me know if it doesn’t show up!” 

* The negative feedback that reappeared when I paid this invoice has once again disappeared. The cancellation request never shows up. 

* I call eBay, and they have no idea why this negative feedback has disappeared. They promise to look into it and call me back within the hour. They never call. 

So… what the hell do I do now? I just want the damn item that this seller had accepted my offer on, and in the alternative, I’d like to leave negative feedback. I’m not sure how my feedback was ever removed in the first place, given eBay policies state that feedback cannot be removed when a buyer showed every intention to pay for the item – and with every phone call, I have reiterated that *I really would prefer to just buy the damn item at the price I agreed on*. I guess the question is – is there anything I can do at this point? What do I do about this “positive” negative review the seller has left me? Should I even bother to call eBay back or should I just accept this as a learning lesson? 

**[UPDATE]** Thanks for all the comments you guys have given me so far, I really appreciate it. The seller has begun sending me ridiculous emails and spam I never signed up for has started arriving at my address.

Ebay,Happened a long time ago but I still wonder if there's anything else I could have done..,"Several years ago I was selling a lot of hockey cards on ebay; specifically, sealed hockey boxes/packs. 

I sold hundreds with no issues. Finally though, I sold a box of sealed packs to someone who opened them, didn't like the cards he got, and sent them back. He opened a case with PayPal and told them he returned the item. I explained to them that the packs were sealed and he had opened every single one of them, effectively making them (practically) worthless. They basically ignored my side and took back the $70 he had paid me, and issued it back to him. Basically I lost a $70 product plus shipping fees. 

I'm pretty sure I tried to appeal either through PayPal or ebay, but nothing happened. Is there anything else to do when PayPal wrongly sides with the buyer?",6.0,3,2014-08-28,EBAY,0.1010650023818016,0.8669836521148682,0.03195135295391083

Ebay,Can I receive a FV credit after refunding a buyer who hasn't opened a case?,"I had an item damaged in transit recently and the buyer asked to send the item back for a refund, which I've agreed to. I received the item back yesterday and want to issue his refund, but I'm worried about still getting hit with the $250 FV fee because the buyer never opened a case (he was also extremely easy to deal with through the whole ordeal). 

On the ebay support pages it really only mentions a credit when the buyer has opened a case, received the refund, then closed the case. Is there a way to get the credit without it counting as a default? Does a refund count as a default now regardless of case status? The only idea I had was to issue the refund then ask him to complete a transaction cancellation but if I can avoid doing that I would prefer it.

The price is fairly cheap, something affordable. However, I am extremely weary about buying something like this online, and being scammed.

Ebay,Fees eating at my margin. What am I missing?,"I'm thinking of getting into selling stuff on Ebay, and my trial has been fairly successful in terms of selling items - but the fees are eating up my margins!

I sell for 39.99, after buying for 33.64 - a solid 6.35 margin. After fees etc... that margin is down to 0.79 (assuming sales through paypal)

I'm more than happy to pay a fee! They provide a good service. But I can't figure out any ways to reduce my costs.

I'm not using any of the ""extra cost features"", my item is free to list. This is purely post-sale fees (ebay 10%, paypal 3.4% + 0.2)

Ebay,I can't believe I just lost money like that.,"I have been a seller on eBay for a long, long time now and this is the first time this happened to me.

I am just wanting to get advice about a situation I was in. A buyer recently contacted me and opened a case for a return a few days ago. I gladly accepted. The package arrived back in my hands and I of course recognized the address, so of course I accepted the package. Well, when I opened the package I found that the buyer had sent the wrong item back. I sold him/her a white iphone 5 that was intact and was sent back parts of a blue iphone 5c. Not the correct item at all, it is totally different. The buyer instantly escalated the case to eBay once tracking showed that I had received the item. I called eBay and uploaded pictures of the package and the device that I received in return and they told me that they'd keep the case open and investigate further.

Anyway, eBay ended up closing the case in the buyer's favor today. Now I am out $130 and the buyer gets to keep the item I sold him and I can't even resell or do anything with the mere parts of a different phone that he/she sent me.

My question now is there anything I can do from here? Has anyone gone through a similar situation and was able to get their money back somehow? This is absolutely crazy and I cannot believe that eBay is aiding and abetting to fraud in a way....

Thanks for advice.

Edit: GOOD NEWS! There is *some* light at the end of this tunnel! Well, eBay would not do anything for me, but PayPal went out of their way and credited me back the $50 I would have originally lost from this transaction!

None of the non-tracked passes have shown up, even though they should have all been delivered by now. I  shipped everything within one hour of getting payment.

Ebay,"Nasty buyer has opened a Paypal claim instead of through eBay, is the process any different?","I sold a lighting dome for a photographic light to a guy in Australia, who has just messaged me on eBay asking for a refund for the item, while declining to send it back because 'Postage would be too expensive'. 

He claims that it's too small, and that although the picture was accurate, the size wasn't obvious and I should have used something for scale. Despite the lack of banana for scale in the picture, I measured the item and gave the diameter in cm on the first (and only) line of the item description. He has clearly overlooked this, but despite his mistake wants me to pay for it.

The buyer is clearly pretty knowledgeable that eBay/Paypal almost always side with the buyer in disputes, and has opened a claim for a refund on Paypal. I've never dealt with a Paypal claim before, here are my options:

* Issue the buyer a refund for the disputed amount of £40.00 GBP. The buyer can keep the item(s).
* Issue the buyer a refund for the disputed amount of £40.00 GBP. The buyer must return the item(s). Do not select this option for virtual/intangible items or services.
* Offer the buyer a partial refund in an attempt to close this claim.
* Provide proof that the buyer has already been refunded.
* Disagree with claim. I would like to provide additional information.

Ebay,"First time selling, phone sold for too MUCH? Help, am I being a bad guy?","My iPhone 4s is about 2.5 years old. The biggest problem is battery life, but I did notice that after using my new phone (5s) that my old one was rather slow, not unusable by any means, but probably deteriorated a fair amount with age (and of course the processing speed is much better on 5s, but still). When selling my phone, I obviously wanted to make it attractive while being honest. I set the minimum bid at $110, reserve at $140, and buy it now at $190. I thought this meant it definitely couldn't go for more than $190, which I thought was reasonable considering the issues. However, the buy it now price disappeared after the first bid, and the phone ended up selling for $256 (with case + cable, ac adapter). 

Here's my problem: I described the phone as ""used iphone with no scratches or blemishes, biggest problem is battery, only lasts about 2-3 hours with minimal use. i would recommend buying a new battery for less than twenty bucks if you are unable to charge your phone at some point during the day. otherwise phone is in good working order.” I never mentioned that the phone was 2.5 years old, or that it was a bit slow. I honestly just didn't know my phone would (or *could*) go for this much and I feel like I am shortselling the buyer :(.

Ebay,Buyer Returning for Refund Cancellation - When Can I Close It?,"Just have a quick question for people who have been through this.  I had a buyer who bought an item and wanted to return it because she didn't like the color.  No problem, she pays return shipping, and she is fine with it.

She mails it back and I receive it a week ago, issue a refund, and open a cancellation request with the reason ""Buyer is returning item for a refund"".

This buyer is new to eBay and is foreign, so she doesn't quite seem to get how to properly contact me through eBay (she just replies to the PayPal payment confirmation email) and doesn't know to check her PayPal account (she emailed me saying the refund hadn't shown up in her bank account yet after 1 business day), so I doubt she knows how to accept a cancellation request.  I did tell her to check her PayPal account and that it generally takes 3-5 business days for refunds to go through to bank accounts or credit/debit cards.

Now the case has been open for over a week (was opened on 8/23/2014 at 10:46 PDT).  I was under the impression that sellers could close out cases after 1 week had passed (which would be today, 8/30/2014 at 10:46 PDT).

Ebay,Is a buyer paying this way okay?,"Completely new to ebay selling. Have recently had 3 auctions finish. For 2 of them the buyers paid via paypal within a few hours and I got the dispatch address etc and posted the parcels. 

For the 3rd I didn't get payment after a day and a half so sent a message asking if he could pay ASAP so that I could get the item dispatched.

His response was:

*hi mate im having a few issues with ebay and paypal so the way i sorted the last 2 things i had to pay for the other day was if you txt me your paypal i can send it due direct via paypal. [Phone number here] cheers luke*

Is it okay/safe if I text him my paypal email address for him to make the payment? I'm worried that the payment will not be tied to the ebay transaction in any way and so he might reclaim it or something, I have no idea how it all works. He has 24 feedback which all seems to be as a buyer, last feedback was only yesterday.

It's not a huge amount (£12 in total) but I'm just really unsure. Tried to talk to a person on ebay live chat but I don't think they fully understood my question. They said if they pay via paypal then you get the same protection etc as normal but not sure if they understood that it wouldn't be through the ebay checkout and would instead just be a manual payment.

EDIT/UPDATE: Sent a short reply to buyer saying that I was happy to wait for the issue to be solved as I would like to sell direct through ebay. If he didn't want to wait/buy the hat any longer I'd sell it to another bidder.

Buyer has replied 

*its nothing to do wuth not wanting the hat. its an issue with linking the accounts. ebay said 2 weeks ago it would be sorted but nothing yet hence the last 10 hats ive had to sort this way with no issues.*

I've sent a response basically saying the same as before, that I want the payment to be through ebay and I'm happy to wait but if the issue is not going to be solved then I'll sell to another bidder.

Ebay,What are the coupon selling rules?,I was thinking of selling my 2 $25 off $50 and a free bra coupon together in a lot. Are there rules against this?

Ebay,Partial refund begging cases are out of control,"So I am getting hammered by people trying to scam a partial refund out of me these days.  Seems like everything I sell for over $20 has a person open a case and claim the Item was not as described even though it clearly was.

I always offer a full refund as soon as they return the item and I never hear from them again and the case closes eventually.  

Has anybody else noticed an increase in this kind of activity lately?",12.0,8,2014-08-31,EBAY,0.04301244765520096,0.9079092741012573,0.04907827451825142
Ebay,Starting Your Own Independent Site,"I'm a TRS and my defect rate is fine, however I think eBay is an increasingly toxic environment and relying on eBay or Amazon limits growth and profitability long term. I'm looking for any advice from someone who has branched out with their own site. How was the transition? I'm not worried too much about the cost of getting up and running, more about the cost of conversion compared to eBay FVF's. I'd be willing to pay more per conversion to be independent - and I know that over time I will receive organic conversions along with repeat business.

If you have any experience in this area I would love to hear from you.",9.0,7,2014-08-31,EBAY,0.017000854015350342,0.8995562195777893,0.08344300091266632
Ebay,"Ebay case opened, needed some advice!","Hi, I've started ebay selling the past few months and got some sales in. As of right now I sell unused(still sealed) software on ebay. The software is either free after rebate or a low price from a bundle purchase. So majority of them had just the UPC cut from the box. I recently has a case opened against me saying ""Item not as described,"" claiming that they can't find a serial key. This is a strange case because the buyer already gave a positive feedback one month ago. I have already responded telling them to check the cd sleeve and also submitted some pictures of the box still sealed. 

What is your advice on this issue? The case has not escalated to ebay resolution yet and the buyer didn't respond yet.

Update: The buyer had closed the case and said that the cd key was found. Thank you everyone for your wonderful and helpful comments.",12.0,5,2014-08-31,EBAY,0.02036219649016857,0.8652707934379578,0.1143670380115509
Ebay,"Charged for shipping by the Post Office, and they wouldn't deliver my purchase. Is the seller on the hook for the fee?","Here's the situation: I ordered a magazine-type guide from a seller on Ebay, paid for it immediately. It shipped, and should've arrived today, but instead, I get a slip in the mail as I would if no one was home to sign for the package. This time, though, it said I had to pay shipping fees amounting to almost $15 before they'd release the package. Isn't shipping paid? Should I contact the seller regarding this fee?

Ebay,"My ""new"" comics/tpb listings are listed as ""acceptable"" condition","A few weeks ago, I listed some brand new hardcover graphic novels in the Comics/TPBs section. They are still in the shrink-wrap, actually. But for some reason they were listed as in ""acceptable"" condition.

I couldn't find an option to list them as ""new"", so I just ended the listings. (I didn't want any discrepancies at all since buyers are so particular).

Tonight, I was trying to again to list them. I thought maybe if I added ""item specifics"" that might help, but again, the books are being shown as ""acceptable"".

I was hoping someone could tell me what I'm doing wrong here.",2.0,2,2014-08-31,EBAY,0.0241048876196146,0.8696170449256897,0.10627801716327667
