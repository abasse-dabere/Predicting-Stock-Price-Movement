Ebay,This is so creepy!,,16,8,2012-05-01,EBAY,0.03761564940214157,0.883045494556427,0.07933884114027023
Ebay,"My item was returned to me, I could use some advice for the next step.","Well, it's a weird situation and I'm not sure how to go about handling this.


First, the item is a foam latex prosthetic nose, a cat nose, which can be glued onto your face and painted with makeup.

By default, it comes unpainted/blank, though we set up options for us to airbrush it and/or add whiskers.


The winner purchased a custom painted nose, and paid for Xpresspost shipping from Canada to the UK, which was $68, it has a service standard of 5-7 business days and a tracking number.  We promptly painted it and shipped it.

Date purchased, March 10th.
Date shipped March 14th.


It arrived in the UK March 18th, it was held by UK Customs, then went out for attempted delivery March 23rd.


It sat at the post office there until April 19th and was returned to sender.  We just received it today, May 1st.


It seems that the auction winner didn't want to pay the customs charges owing on the package, some  21.54 GBP,  and decided not to pay and ignore the package. We've not received any contact from the buyer, the buyer only has 1 feedback.


So what should we do?  I don't feel like getting negative feedback over the buyer's mistake/change of heart over the item.  The mask was also custom painted specifically to his instructions and is otherwise un-sellable to others.  Also we don't want to be out the $68 on shipping.


Should we try contacting the buyer?
Should we just stay quiet since it's past the paypal dispute window?
Should we re-attempt to ship the item by a less expensive method?",16,3,2012-05-01,EBAY,0.09475981444120407,0.8755166530609131,0.02972353622317314

Ebay,Question about Flat Rate Envelopes,"So I have a stack of magazines that I was planning on shipping out in a medium flat rate box. However, the box is quite big compared to the stack of magazines so I put it in one of those Tyvek Priority Flat Rate Mailing Envelopes. I'm able to seal the envelope but it's about 3 inches thick due to the magazines. They're fit more snugly in there than in the box and since the envelope is Tyvek I'm not too concerned about it ripping. Am I allowed to ship this? It's about $5 cheaper than shipping it in the box...I feel like I'm cheating the system or something. Is this okay to do? I don't want to get to the post office and be berated or something.

Ebay,Seller deleted from Ebay 2 hours after paying. Need advice.,"So i won an auction for a AMD Radeon HD 6950 on ebay yesterday and finally got round to paying for it today. The seller is based in california by his profile and he only had 5 or 6 feedbacks. I got it for a great price and i thought everything was good so i sent the money today.

A couple of hours later i get an e-mail from ukrswebhelp@ebay.com:

**We're writing to let you know that the listing for the following item you bid on has been removed:

320899394710 - Brand New XFX AMD Radeon HD 6950 (HD-695A-CNFC) 2 GB GDDR5 SDRAM PCI Express 2.1

If you haven't yet paid for this item, we strongly recommend that you do not complete this purchase. If the seller asks you to continue with the sale after the item has been ended by eBay, the item won't be covered by eBay buyer protection. Purchases completed outside of eBay are extremely risky and highly susceptible to fraud.**

Not only has the listing vanished but the seller i was buying from as well. The money is currently sitting in paypal waiting to be claimed and i don`t know if i can cancel it or not. I tried following the links and guides the email sent me on but apparently paypal is telling Ebay not to open a case.

I`m really confused and the Ebay call centre in my area isn`t open till tomorrow morning and i`d like to know what the hell is going on! :S

UPDATE: (sorry for the late update reddit was blocked at college) So i phoned Paypal today about this issue and they told me that one of two things might have happened.

1. the guys e-mail might be incorrect, but is this was true then i should have a cancel transaction button in my action bar beside the transaction.

2. This guys paypal account dosnt accept GBP so he will need to ""accept it manually"" what ever that means.

they told me i would basicly have to wait to see what happens. if he dosn`t claim it in 30 days i get the money back or if he does claim it i need to wait a suitable amount of time before making a case through paypal. :S.

so essentially they told me i`m down £140 for at least 30 days &gt;:(",7,5,2012-05-07,EBAY,0.0954887866973877,0.8770751357078552,0.02743605710566044

Ebay,"So after mailing over 200+ items, i got my first DEMAND for a return. How do i handle this?","So i've mailed and packaged over 200 things. stuff ranging from barlight fixtures, neon signs, 50 collectible coca colas glasses, and I got my first pissed off buyer letter over some Video Games.

I'm not sure how to handle the situation, so I'll post everything, and let reddit guide me.


I sold a lot of 14 PC Games, each disk was inside the box, I taped each box shot, and they were all wrapped together with a protective sheeting and crammed into a flatrate box.  I was 100% confident the item would arrive safely, as I couldn't imagine a scenario where it could arrive damaged. I've sent glass figurines, glasses, and tons of other fragile stuff. pc games in dvd boxes seemed safe.


anyways here was the message i got today:

""Hello,

was getting ready to leave you negative feedback but thought I had better write you first and give you a chance to explain and correct this.

I got my items today but thanks to you deciding to cram it all into one box and not bothering to think of how horribly the post office handles packages the box is crushed in half, ripped apart, and the items inside all destroyed with the cases all cracked into pieces and the discs all laying inside the postal box, some in pieces cracked and some scratched up beyond belief with booklets ripped in half!  

I am writing you for a full and complete refund issued immediately. WITHIN 24 HOURS! If you want this mess back then you are going to pay to have me send it back to you and of course it will be in the same pieces and broken and destroyed as the way that it arrived to me courtesy of your horrible fucking decision to try and save a buck and just throw all of this into a flat rate box with no protective package material not to mention it didn't fit without you cramming it in!


SO, I am prepared to leave you negative feedback and file a complain and refund order with paypal and ebay If I do not hear back from you within 24hours and you handle this problem that your ass created.   

I cannot begin to tell you just how disappointed you left me and my family by the poor decision you made to cram all this into a flat rate box just to save a buck! I tried hard to win your auction and this is the thanks that I get for it????

I will be awaiting your reply and swift refund or I will proceed with filing a claim and the negative feedback.""













-









My response to him was this:

I apologize, and I am more than happy to refund you. I do want it returned first or photographed. 

I apologize about the shipping, I've sent tons of items and never had an issue. I've sent things from glasses, to dvd lots. I assumed since they were crammed in there, they wouldn't have gone anywhere, or opened up, and cracked. I really apologize. I figured the extra layer of sheeting and tape would have kept them from opening up, and I figured the tight fitting box would have kept them from going anywhere.

I APOLOGIZE..

I can assure you, i didn't use a flatrate box to save on shipping. Realistically, i would have saved more money not sending it priority. i've sent tons of items, MUCH larger, and sending them parcel is ALWAYS cheaper.


Again, I'd like to have photographs of the item, or have it sent back before I offer a refund.""






I think what I am asking for is 100% fair, but the guy comes off as such a douchebag, because he is cursing, making 24 hour demands, and used the bs line that his family is disappointed when it is obvious he is a reseller, he literally buys 20 lots of games a day. and his info says he runs a store.

and looking through his comment history I wrote some of the users he has recently dealt with, and he has accused over 10 sellers of the same thing. broken/damage product, and he comes off as a douchebag to everyone who told me they had issues with him.



IMO he is a scammer, but he is such a douchebag i expect him to purposely break the product just to make me pay him. I don't care.. I'll refund him, but i want to see the items broken first.


my big issue is, I no longer have the cash to refund him in my paypal. I'll have more cash in 3 days, but he is so pissy and refund demanding, I'm not sure he will wait. he mentions multiple times he wants it within 24hours, so if he does take this to a dispute, would paypal give me 3 days to get the money to refund him, before overdrafting from my bank account?",13,4,2012-05-12,EBAY,0.0745856761932373,0.8921536803245544,0.033260639756917953

However, in two other pics on the auction you can see the damaged key when looking really closely, so I know the damage did not occur during shipping. The seller has 100% positive feedback with over 600 feedback as seller. It does seem unlikely he would decide to start defrauding people now but the simple fact is the item description states ""All the keys and buttons work perfectly"" which anyone who spends longer than 5 seconds testing the keyboard can tell is clearly not the case. I did look at all the images before bidding but there is only a slight visual difference between the broken key and the normal keys and I saw no need to scrutinize them because the listing trumps all and he listed them as perfect condition.

Truth be told I would rather keep the synth than send it back, and I might be able to have it repaired, but the costs will most likely not be cheap. I have heard something about eBay making the seller pay for any repairs that are required to bring the item up to the condition it was advertised as in the auction, as part of the eBay buyer protection. Can anyone tell me if this is indeed an option and how I would go about making this happen? The auction has 7-day returns so I have until next Friday to declare my intentions but I'd rather not wait that long.

As a bonus question, in the case of a fraudulent item listing, is there a way I can return the synth for a refund without having to pay return shipping, seeing as it's not a return for frivolous reasons (such as simply disliking it), but because it's physically damaged and not as advertised?

Ebay,A question about bidding for items.,"Over the past few months, I've been getting more and more into checking out items on eBay, even selling a few of my own belongings.
I've been looking at purchasing a PS Vita lately, but seeing as the system is $250 for the wi-fi only version, I've taken to eBay to find myself a bargain. Over the past few days, I've been watching and keeping track of a few good deals; but when I check on them later on, the bid has been raised drastically by many other users. Why do people do this?

The way I look at it is like this. If I bid on a popular item three days before the item ends, somebody else is going to see my bid and raise it further, and then somebody else will do the same to them, and so on. So wouldn't it be more intelligent to place the item on your watch list and bid on it when there is a very small amount of time left (say, about half a minute) so that you have a greater shot at winning the item? Rather than cause the item to have an even greater price than hoped for, I feel like it is smarter to just wait until the last minute, keeping a close eye on the product during the last few minutes.

Just a thought I've had recently. Wanted to know what you guys think.",6,6,2012-05-14,EBAY,0.023253140971064568,0.9093727469444275,0.06737414002418518

Ebay,Help me identify anything shady in this return process?,"I recently bought a Game Boy Advance pokemon game on ebay that turned out to be fake (this was my dumbass fault. should have seen it coming a mile away) so I contacted the seller about a refund. 

The seller almost immediately refunded my money and opened a ""cancel transaction"" case (based on ""Buyer requested shipment to a country I don't ship to,"" which isn't true. I figured they just selected this arbitrarily?). They asked me to accept this.

They asked me to ship the item back to a PO box in Malta, of all places (that island off of Italy). This PO box is the same return address on the envelope they sent the game in. Note that on the auction, the seller had it listed that the item was in Germany. Sketchy.

I've never had to deal with a cancel transaction case, and ebay tells me ""You should only accept the cancellation request if you haven't paid yet or you've already received your refund from the seller.""

Additionally, the person said they would refund my return shipping costs. So I have these questions:

1)Should I accept the cancel transaction request?

2)I'm not sure how expensive shipping to Malta is (although it is a very very small package. I could fit it in an envelope). How do I make sure I don't get shafted in the return shipping process? How do I make sure the buyer fulfills their word on refunding return shipping?

3)Am I walking into any traps by sending this back (what precautions should I take)?

4)If the answer to the #3 is ""yes,"" what is the next course of action?

Ebay,"EBAY-FOCUSED VIRUS - ZBIDDY.  ""Move over ebay, there's a new auction in town""...","Ok the short and dirty of it is this: you pick up a virus somewhere named pup.bundleinstaller.vg. Malwarebytes will catch it if you scan but it's already installed and has done its damage. Luckily it's not too hard to fix once you know where to look. See my attachment. Those are NOT a part of ebay, and they cause a popup that you can only see sometimes, but you'll always hear a woman talking about ""move over ebay, there's a new auction in town""... Pretty brazen to hack their site, advertise on it, then tell them to get out of the way! Anyway, if this happens to anyone here, the fix is:

1. Scan your pc with malwarebytes. download, install, and scan your computer with this: http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/down...s-anti-malware

2. It should find pup.bundleinstaller.VG. It's a brand new virus, if you google it there isn't much info. Hit the ""remove infection"" button on malwarebytes. Ok, it's gone, but it still has a helper in your browser that will try to bring it back.

3. Go to your browser's options/tools/addons. Look for a toolbar called ""Iobit"" or ""Iminent"", those are the only 2 I know of but if you see ANY toolbar you didn't install(no one should use toolbars/searchboxes anymore anyway, they're almost all spam and add no value compared to just googling it yourself), delete it with utmost prejudice.

Ebay,Seller went berserk when I told him the item was not as described - things have just gone full WTF.,"I bought a MIDI keyboard from a guy that looked legit, had &gt;200 feedback (100% positive) and he said the keyboard was very lightly used and in working condition. There was a picture that showed it was in great condition. It came with no box or no additional items - just the keyboard itself.

The first communication was the seller contacting me a week or so after close to tell me he had not shipped the item yet because he hurt his back, and he would ship that day. I responded with a ""no problem"". Sure enough, I received the package a few days later. I opened it and it was very well packed in tons of bubble wrap. There was clearly no damage in shipment.

Next I plug in the keyboard and test it out, and I find out that an important feature of the keyboard (and the reason I bought it) is not fully working. There are keys that do not send any MIDI messages to my PC and I can prove that they are dead/nonworking.

I contact the seller and politely tell the seller of my problem and that the item description made no mention of the faulty keys. I say it was not damaged in shipment from what I can tell. I asked him ""How to do we resolve this?"" because in his auction he listed ""no returns"". I put the ball in his court. I made no threats, I was polite and courteous.

He comes back at me with a defensive, accusatory response, telling me that he believes I am lying to him about the product condition. He assures me in all caps that he TESTED the product and that how dare I imply he is a liar (I did no such thing). He then says that it is ""unreasonable"" of me to expect a fully working keyboard with no defects simply because I got a ""good deal"" on the keyboard, even though I paid just slightly less than the typical ebay sell price (shipped). Regardless, it shouldn't matter because the item description was not accurate. Already I knew dealing with him is going to be a hassle.

So up until this point he has been adamant about no returns. Now he says that I can ship the keyboard back to him (and pay for return shipping) and that he will refund 60% of the sell price (less shipping, which accounted for about 1/3 of the total price I paid). If I were to take that deal, I would be roughly throwing $70 down the drain for no good reason, with nothing to show for it. So I turn down the deal and he freaks out and starts insulting me and asking rhetorical questions like ""WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU?""

I tell him at this point I have no choice but to open a case in the eBay Resolution Center. He baits me and tells me to go ahead, so I did. I sent another email showing PC screenshots of all the testing I did to prove that the keyboard is not fully functional. eBay then says they will review the case and make a judgement. That was yesterday. 

Today I get an email from eBay saying they will issue me a full refund and they sent me a prepaid shipping label with tracking/delivery confirmation. They instruct me to ship the item to the seller and then they will issue a refund. I'm fine with this, so I plan on shipping out the keyboard tomorrow.

Now, after this happened, I get an email from the seller and suddenly his tone is nice and apologetic. He tells me he is going to issue a full refund (which I then I see in my Paypal account shortly after). And here is the kicker where this turns WTF. He sends me the following message:

&gt;I hope I caught this in time; I thought about this and I have issued a full refund and please keep the [product name] if you have not shipped it yet, my gift to you.

WTF. I feel like he is trying to trap me here. Why in the world would he issue a full refund and then not want me to ship the item back to him? And now how am I supposed to deal with eBay, because eBay was going to send me a refund after they got delivery confirmation of the item being returned. So should I just ship the item back to him with the prepaid label and then see what happens? I don't feel comfortable keeping the item after the seller refunded my money, nor do I understand why he would say that after he has been nothing but accusatory and defensive to me. If I did keep the item (and the refund) what would be the potential outcome and could I get in trouble with eBay somehow? I'm just trying to do the right thing here.

Please advise.

*edit* Just received a further explanation from the seller:

We've requested a refund and have been turned down by the seller because we opened one of the boxes and he can no longer sell it on, plus the fact that he listed it as boxes only. The listing did say boxes only when we went back to review it, but it was listed under the ""Video Games"" section on Ebay.

Ebay,I need some general advice dealing with a defective item I received.,"I purchased a Wii as a present for a friend and received it in short order. The first thing I noticed was that it had no doors on the side; and that it was supposed to include a free random game which was missing.

Two of the games I was intending to include with it produce the following error message: ""An error has occurred. Press the eject button and remove the disc, then turn the Wii console off and refer to the Wii Operations Manual for help troubleshooting.""

The game discs are in original condition and work in my system.

I checked with the seller and sent it back. A week after they received it, I inquired about status and they told me they would get to it soon. So I ordered one from amazon. 

It's been three weeks since they received it and I'm still getting messages from them similar to this: ""we get that same error message whenever there is a problem with the discs &amp; have only ever seen it when there is a problem with the discs. We paid an employee to test this system for an hour with near a dozen different games, not a single problem or instance of what you described.""

I thought it might be a problem my end, so I made sure my card was linked to Paypal even though I've had no problems before.

I left it a few days to see if it would clear and it didn't so I contacted the seller asking if she had received it, she responded saying:
&gt;hi not i had problems with pay pal had to close the paypal account your payment was not showing in pay pal ?


Which didn't make a lot of sense to me, so I replied saying I would cancel the payment and try again. I did that on 10/5/12 and contacted them asking them to let me know. No reply.

No reply.

Ebay,Goodbye Ebay (a rant),"I have never been a big-time Ebay user, but recently I decided to sell of some old stuff, mostly electronics. I always made sure everything was working properly and that all configuration, passwords, etc. was given to the buyer.

A few weeks ago after I sold another old electronics item, the buyer contacted me in Italian (I neither speak Italian, nor was my article description in that language). After asking for an English translation I received a message obviously translated using Google Translate. The buyer was claiming that I sent a defective item on purpose. In a second message he requested 50 Euros back (article was sold for 70 Euros) or he would give me a negative feedback.

I replied offering that he sends back the article and gets his full payment back (which is what the Ebay Help pages suggested). If the article would turn out as defective, I would cover his shipping fee as well. Not two hours later he gives me negative feedback and says he repaired the article.

I looked into the Help pages again, and found the description of ""Feedback extortion"". I contacted Ebay, but they said reviews are part of ""Freedom of Speech"" and that there would be nothing they could do. How exactly is it free speech if the buyer can give any feedback he likes without repercussions, but the seller can only ever give positive feedback?

I think I almost fell victim to a scam here (article suddenly working again when I ask for it back before I give a refund). Luckily I did not just give a refund without getting it back, but I am still left with a bad review, and all I can do is giving the buyer a positive review :-(

Ebay,Question about best offers,"In your experience, when making a counter offer do people usually accept, or do you lose a lot of buyers that way?

I started doing best offer on almost all my listings, and it has worked wonderfully for me. I've gotten pretty good offers that I've just accepted. Now I have an item where they're offering half the buy it now price. I feel like the offer isn't bad for the item. I don't want to lose the buyer, but I kind of would like to get a little more for it.

If I counteroffer and they refuse, can I go back and accept their first offer?

Also, buyer has 0 feedback and has been a member since '09. Should I take a chance on them?

Another question about receiving offers: I just read that buyers can specify other terms for the sale, which is visible only on the second page of the offer, but I don't have two pages on my offer. Is that old information?

Ebay,I (SELLER) Won My Appeal! Now what do I do with item?,"The buyer of my item contacted me on day it was received,  claimed he thought item was refinished product and not as described. Buyer went into great detail about his initial inspection of the item (a shotgun stock) and said that due to the way the pores of the wood looks, the grain, the checkering etc that he feels it is refinished and not as expected. I tell buyer that I have handled countless stocks from this manufacturer, not likely refinished but I will refund as I need him to be happy- we agree on partial refund and I do it immediately. 

Two days later buyer contacts me again, says that when he went to install the item he found a crack, now wants full refund and return. I ask for pictures- he sends them- there is a crack.  He files claim with ebay and sends Item back. I get item in my hands and choose to escalate the case vs refund, as it was obvious to me crack was new and caused by buyer.  Ebay immediately rules for buyer- sends him refund from my paypal.   Instead of appealing through the system, I call ebay and get support from foreign call center (always the nicest most polite people even if they don't know what they are doing)  I explain carefully that customers own words in first contact reveals how well he inspected item and there was no crack- support reads through all of our exchanges- she agrees that something is fishy and moves me on to a manager who was in US. I talk to manager and she reads all of the exchanges and at first sounded like she was siding with buyer as I acknowledged there was a crack.  I went through chain of events again, she took a few minutes to read all of the exchanges again.  I told her I had pics of stock before I sent it- and of new crack. She said she would contact me through email for an address to send my pics to. Next contact is in an hour and she tells me they ruled in my favor, money is back in my account.  YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!

So now I still have the damaged item. I imagine the buyer would want it back as I think he paid for it unless ebay has refunded me from their own funds? I tried to contact customer support again but the nice lady could not understand what I was asking, kept telling me that they had made ruling and that was that, or customer needs to return it to me for refund????

Ebay,Improvements to ebay,"I been selling on eBay for over 11 years now and I have seen it go completly downhill since sellers can not longer leave bad feed back for buyers. 
But I just wanted to start a thread on ways to improve eBay. 

1. No more 4 days for buyers to pay, 24-48 hours at most. 

2. 12 hour auctions some things dont need 24 hours to sell. 

3. Bring back option to leave negative feedback for buyers, at least    let sellers be able to say if the buyer is a non-payer. 

4. Quit offering me free listings, I dont mind paying lising fees. It is the final value fees that really eat in to my profits. 

5. Possibly separate wholesalers from the mom and pops. Wholesalers have runied ebay for the little guy. I would much rather do business with the casual seller (which is what made ebay so popular) now its flooded with discounters, large box stores, and wholesalers. 

these are my suggestions

Ebay,PayPal charge backs,"Normally I'm a seller on ebay and fortunately I have not had to deal with any charge backs, so I'm not entirely sure how it all works out. 

Recently I make an offer on an item. TBH I did't think it was likely the seller would accept it since it was quite a low price. Turns out he did accept it so it looks like I will have to go with the deal. On further research the seller seems a little suspicious. He has only 200 feedback and at the moment he is selling a few hundred high ticket items(bullion) totaling well over $70,000 with most items finishing about a day appart. 

My question is if I pay for it via paypal and it is indeed a scammer is there a way of getting my money back? Paypal generally will protect the seller providing they can provide proof of postage etc. 

Say for example he sends an insured parcel with a rock in it would this make the charge back impossible?

Or if he withdraws the amount from his paypal into his bank account so PP cant get access to it?

Ebay,Guy from Latvia takes really long to claim his items havn't arrived,"Hello /r/ebay,

I usually post responses to the questions on this forum but today I am asking one. I sell mostly costume jewellery which is sort of hip-hop/blingy. Most people usually buy 1 item from me, sometimes people buy more though as you would expect with jewellery.

On 7th May a Latvian buyer buys 3x necklaces from me, this is unusual as Latvians don't usually buy from me and international buyers usually only buy 1 item like most customers. It's nothing extraordinary though. 

I ship 8th May via Royal Mail (UK) and the usual delivery time for European orders is roughly 5-7working days maximum. I know this because the customers always message me in broken English asking where their items are after 3~ days so I think this delivery time is considered to be fairly long.

Today he messages me (27th May) claiming he hasn't received these necklaces. I always side with the buyer here usually and just ship them the products again. I'm pretty sure I will just resend him 3x his product again but I think it is really late for him to be saying they havn't arrived given most Europeans message me after a few days as I stated above and he has never contacted me since. 

It just seems far too late to be saying this but I think I will just side with him anyway as there is no way I would win a case.

Obviously I don't have a tracking number because then postage is 3x~ more expensive and it isn't an option when sending costume jewellery or I wouldn't be able to compete internationally.

Edit: If it's worth anything he has 1 feedback and doesn't use ebay regularly at all. I think this is sort of irrelevant though.",5,6,2012-05-27,EBAY,0.05164829641580582,0.9194528460502625,0.028898870572447777

Ebay,Seller Protection When Shipping Overseas from the US,"I sold a broken as-is iPhone to an eBay user from Ukraine and plan to ship it from the US via USPS International Priority Mail in a small, flat-rate box.

The shipping should cost around $17 with USPS, but I'm fine with paying a bit more for another carrier.

Ebay,My ebay page is loading very screwy and I need some general guidance,"I use Firefox most of the time, although I kind of resolved this problem through IE.  I don't know if my problem is an ""ebay"" problem, a Firefox problem, or a compatability problem between Firefox/ebay.

Two items which my wife purchased (and received) show up on the buyer page - but it never quite pulls up the picture.

His reply:
**""The case comes apart and can be clipped back together.""**

Edit: So I filed a paypal dispute asking for a full refund  and she denied it, offer 50 as she payed 250 for it and stand by her claims of its excellent condition, I denied that saying that I could even use 2/3 of the case without repair so it was not in excellent condition and I offered 65 for a refund,she again denied it and said 50 was her best offer.

The claim has sided with me for a full refund on the condition I return the case to her at my expense
