Ebay,Buyer claiming a misrepresented product. Any advice would be much appreciated.,"I recently sold a J. Crew cashmere blazer on Ebay and all went well, the buyer paid, I shipped the item, and I thought the transaction was fine. However, I received a message from the buyer claiming the item was not as described. The first problem they had was that they had no way to prove it was actually cashmere because the item did not have tags, even though I listed the item as ""New without tags"". Their second problem was that they felt as though the jacket was a smaller size than actually labeled on the inside of the jacket. They had no reasoning why they felt this way, but they insisted that it must have been altered and misrepresented. In the listing I provided the chest, shoulder, and sleeve measurements that I personally measured the day I listed the blazer, so they would have known the size regardless of what the size labeled inside the jacket. What do I do with this situation? Thanks for the help

Ebay,Need help starting an account got the product to sell but the eBay limitations are slowing me down.,"Hello everybody

I'm trying to start an account on eBay as I have a few hundred different types of product. (Lots and lots of different variations)

But what I'm seeing is when I start the account it limits me 10 items or $1000 per month

Ebay,I Doubt I Have Any Options?,"A guy in Florida bought three signed books from me. One was $200, the second was $20 and the last was $10. He marked the item as paid via Propay. However, he did not actually pay. Unfortunately, I received a very similar amount the same day via Propay. I confused it for the book payment and shipped the books. Luckily, I caught my error and had it held at the post office. The guy got mad but eventually he paid via Propay. I called the post office and had it released.

I just got an all caps message from the guy today saying I screwed him and he only got one book. I replied and asked him which one and I suspect he will say the $10 one. I know I shipped all three and I checked my inventory to verify it.

I was a bit sketched out because it was a PO box with a different registration name than the eBay account. However, the person had ~150 feedback, mostly on signed books like I sold so I went ahead and released the package after he paid.

I'm assuming I'm out of luck when he opens a case? If not, what can I do? I've been scammed my fair share of times on ebay but this one really irks me by the way he played it out.

Ebay,Good idea or bad idea?  Buy bigger bubble envelope than item,"I'm thinking now that I can buy small bubble envelopes but imagine if I need a bigger one later on and I don't want to spend for different sizes when I can get a lot for cheap...

Ebay,What is eBays policy on undelivered purchases?,"I have ordered a product from the USA and it was sent on the 14th of Jan.

As of the 2nd of Feb today it has still not arrived and according to the USPS website it has been at a USPS processing center since the 20th of Jan.

I am in Australia and have checked with our postal service and nothing has hit our shores yet.

Now the sticky bit is I have tried to Contact USPS direct however because I am not a US Citizen I cannot email them because their web form does not allow questions from non US addresses, and I am unable to call them international because basically when their customer service lines are available I am at work or in bed.

I have contacted the user who has been very good at responding to my emails, however I feel he could be a bit more helpful in getting in touch with USPS for me. 

Any ways he has basically said lets wait, his policy is 45 days. 
After which he will either refund my money or send me another at half price.

My question is, on the PayPal dispute page it states disputes must be made within 45 days.

If i leave it as per this sellers ""Policy"" I leave myself at his mercy without the support of eBay.

Ebay,Best/Fastest way to transfer to bank for cash?,"Hi all,

As of late the only money coming in for me is from eBay/PayPal sales as I buy a few things at Goodwill a week and recently have started selling items for friends for a commission.

I was wondering what is the fastest way to transfer from PayPal to a bank account or some kind of card?

Currently I transfer money to TD Bank and it takes 3 or 4 days, as PayPal says.

I didn't know if there were any alternatives (even alternate bank branches) that transfer quicker.

Ebay,Advice on a Situation,"I posted about this last night before I had more information. I have gained a lot of information since then and the question has changed, so I would appreciate any help. Here is the original post for the full background: http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/17q8iy/i_doubt_i_have_any_options/

A short version of my story: I sent a buyer three items worth $200, $20, and $10. The buyer claims that the only item in the package was the $20 item but I know for certain that I sent all three. I've been contacting other sellers from the buyer's feedback page to see if anything similar happened to them. eBay only let's you contact ~5 sellers a day but out of those (the five most recent feedbacks) one had the buyer claim the package was broken open and nothing inside, another had the buyer claim the items were different than what he ordered, and a third was tricked into shipping before payment was received and then the check was ""lost in the mail"". 

The buyer used a PO box. However, they paid me via a credit card processor so I have a home address. The female in the home matches the name on the PO box. However, the person running the eBay account claims to be a male with the same name (it's a unisex name). The male in the home address is an attorney at the state attorney's office. (Call me creepy, but I can find a decent amount of verifiable information via Google.)

What this screams to me is identity theft. However, the eBay account has been buying since summer 2012 and has ~190 feedback. The PO box is in a different town than the home address on the credit card but only about 20 minutes away. I feel like they would have been caught by now if this was truly identity theft, but I may be wrong.

I kind of feel like I should call the attorney's office who is listed as living at the address on the credit card. I doubt that a state attorney would partake in this type of fraud so maybe they could help me figure out if this is a case of identity theft or maybe someone else in the home. Does that seem like a good idea?

Also, anyone else have any other ideas about what could be going on here? It just kind of irks me that this has clearly happened multiple times and eBay has yet to take action. We have all reported the buyer to eBay so hopefully that will change that soon. I feel like it may take local authorities to prevent more small sellers like myself from losing money. Out of the four sellers including myself who were definitely scammed, we lost about $700 total. I have no idea how many more may be out there.",3,7,2013-02-03,EBAY,0.049624003469944,0.9176098108291626,0.03276617452502251
Ebay,Does anyone else have any cursed items?,"I mostly sell CD's &amp; Records. I am constantly listening to new music so my collection changes and I sell through ebay to have money to buy more music.

I've had more ""no pays"" on this item than every other item combined. It has gone for prices ranging from $25-$65. I'm about to relist it again after another recent no pay.

The other funny thing I had happen recently involved a no pay. I started a dispute over non payment and to my surprise the bidder finally paid for his item the day before the dispute ended. Then I had to work 5 days straight during post office hours and couldn't ship it.

I get a message on the 4th day from the buyer saying,

It's shipping from Hong Kong and will take two weeks, so I'm probably looking at an April delivery right now.

This is far too long for something I could buy for a comparable price elsewhere right now, and I may have moved away by then also.

Ebay,Getting Fleeced: Ebay Style,"Needing some advice from my fellow Ebayers. I bought a Best Buy gift card from a friend who had 220 on it and wanted to get rid of it. After purchasing it, I walked around Best Buy and decided I would just sell it on Ebay. The card sold for 220 and I sent it certified mail to the buyer. Two days later, the buyer contacts me and says the numbers were scratched off and the balance is zero. I had posted a balance inquiry from the night I posted the auction showing the correct amount. He clearly is lying. He then made a claim with Ebay who immediately sided in his favor and told him to send the gift card back. Now here's the thing, I know he can not possibly be sending back the correct gift card as he knows I am able to look up the transaction registry and prove his dishonesty. How do I prove that what he sends me is not what I sent him? I know I can check the card he sends and prove that card did not have a 220 balance at any time but how do I prove that what he sends is the incorrect card?

Ebay,Any reason to be wary of UK based Thai importer?,"Hi all,

I'm a pretty frequent eBay buyer, and am wondering if anyone can help me figure out whether buying from a UK based seller that imports Thai exotic leather goods - mostly crocodile, ostrich, snakeskin, etc. - is risky. I am looking to buy an ostrich skin handbag, which seems to be very tricky because apparently ostrich skin handbags were popularized by Hermes (to the tune of $30,000!) and so similar bags can command ridiculous prices (many thousands of dollars) even though other ostrich skin goods are much more reasonable (I collect cowboy boots and have a few ostrich pairs, so I didn't anticipate how weird the handbag market is.) Ostrich leather is nice, but not that nice!!

Here are reasons I am wary of the seller:

- They have a good feedback rating, but mostly as as buyer, and as a seller, it is mostly for considerably cheaper goods - 30 dollars versus several hundred. They only have 2 or three (positive) from their exotic leather sales, a market it appears they are new to.

- Most of the pictures are stock photos (and can be found on a few other importing sites). 

- They are listing starting at .99. So far all their bags have been bid up to around 200 dollars, which is vastly cheaper than comparable Thai ostrich bags which are listed starting around $700 and on up. That said, completed listings indicate that people aren't paying $700-3000 for these bags. And given what I know about the cost of ostrich leather and handbag manufacturing, it's not inconceivable that someone could sell these bags for much less and still make a profit.

- They are listed as accepting returns within 14 days, but in the listing text indicate they accept returns if the item is not as described. 

Other than that, the items are well described with many photos. The English is good. The ostrich definitely looks real. I am inclined to try for one unless this sets off alarm bells for some of you eBay veterans.

Thank you for any input!",2,2,2013-02-07,EBAY,0.04465048387646675,0.9071711301803589,0.048178333789110184

So let's so I post an item for 10 dollars, no BIN, for 7 days.  Any intelligent person will just only bid ONE SINGLE TIME at the last minute or so.  However, the way that a real auction system should work, if eBay wants to encourage bids, is to not say how long is left.

For example, if my item were just simply up for auction then people would bid just because nobody knows when it ends.  Certainly there are flaws to my system but it directly addresses the problem of only bidding one time to win an auction.  I mean literally there isn't a single reason to bid more than once.

This is just something I've thought up.  They have professionals who think of this stuff.  eBay should take this idea and fix and test it.  More bids = more money for them and sellers and more fun for buyers.",12,0,2013-02-08,EBAY,0.041484151035547256,0.9230052828788757,0.03551051765680313

Ebay,"Paypal/eBay Taxes, Selling in someone else's name","Hello everybody, I have some questions regarding possible taxation from PayPal and/ or eBay.

I have heard that once you receive or sell a certain value of goods you will have to fill out a tax form.

First off, what is that official number ($)?

Also, I am using my sister's PayPal for all of my selling. It appears she already entered her SSN and Tax ID into the ""My Personal Info Section"". Will this be a problem?

ALSO, I am not 18 yet, and I know you technically cannot use PayPal or eBay until you are 18. I will be turning 18 on April 24th this year.

I have sold about $3,000 since June (when I opened the eBay account), and I recently started selling some friends' things for a commission, so my sales will likely go up a lot more, at least until they run out of stuff.

So, am I setting myself up for some disaster by selling in my sister's name and not being 18 yet?

Ebay,Should I trust this buyer?,"(UK)

Someone bought my iPhone recently, but is yet to pay. 
Here is a direct copy of their message to me today:

""Hello Seller

am the buyer of your ebay item i will likme you to send me your paypal emailo address so that i can make the payment Via paypal tonigth and you can send the item to me by tomorrow monring i want you to know that if you refuse to send me your payypal emaiil address for the payment thsy is no way i can make the payment ok Kindly send me that so your money will be cerdit after i made the payment ok Get back to me with your paypal emaill or your mooney request now ok"".

I kid you not, the grammar is that bad.

What I presume is he wants to send the money through PayPal.com directly, and not eBay.co.uk 'Pay Now' which is through PayPal anyway in this case. 
Am I right by thinking this would take away the protections that eBay gives me against fraud etc.?
I know that in the past, PayPal had not a care for the seller, but the buyer. 

His feedback is 2 at 100%, but hidden, and he joined in 2011.

Going by Google Maps he wants the iPhone delivered to either a jewelers or a offices above.

I'm currently letting him analyze my reply and wait for him to pay for it, even if it takes a few weeks. 

What would you do?
Would you trust him?



Edit: Thanks for the great advice! I am definitely not going to let him pay through PayPal directly instead of eBay checkout!",7,6,2013-02-10,EBAY,0.044382281601428986,0.923534631729126,0.032083142548799515

Ebay,Is this normal? - Item not received (dispatched),"Hi,

Well I am both TRS and Powerseller on ebay so of course I will always dispatch my items on time and actually bother to do it.

I actually feel like a scammer in that i've now had to open 2 cases (and probably 2 more today) for item not received because the seller has not bothered to dispatch the item 4 times and kept my money.

I have bought 65-70 items from ebay in the past 3 months of which 90%+ is from casual sellers.

1st seller - claims he will dispatch it and is busy, then I have no contact with him for 3 weeks so I open a case and win as he never responds once after the initial messages and did not dispatch.

2nd seller - no contact with me at all, never marks as dispatched, just keeps my money.

3rd seller - I will open a case against him today, bought item around 20th January, he claims he is busy but will post it, marks as dispatched, I contact him again and he says he still hasn't done it but will soon. Today - no contact for 10 days and he still has my money.

4th seller - Marked as dispatched after 4-5 days, I have had no response in 2 weeks and they also still have my money.

Will this affect my account in any way? Of course I don't want to lose my selling account because I keep having to open cases against people, but when they don't dispatch items and keep my money what can I do?",5,2,2013-02-10,EBAY,0.0705694630742073,0.9016127586364746,0.027817727997899055

Ebay,Seller asking for advice. Buyer is requesting to return an item advertised as used and damaged with claims that it is more damaged than what was described.,"I recently listed and sold an item that I advertised as used  and with damage. Pictures of the damage was included in the listing. Here is the listing's description as well as accompanying pictures:

&gt; Hello, and thank you for checking out my listing. 
You are looking at a DSF Beloved Tales Lilo and Stitch Pin - LE 300 that was released on January 26, 2013 at the Disney Soda Fountain store in Hollywood. It comes on it's original Beloved Tales Series card and in it's original plastic packaging. Please note that this is a returned item and note the scratches above Stitch. No returns, sorry. International shipping is also available; just ask.
Thank you much :)

[Pictures included in the listing](http://imgur.com/a/RTElv#0)



Today, however, I received a message from the buyer with claims that it ""is much more damaged than what was described."" The full message is as follows:


&gt;when I purchased your item, I understood that sometimes pins come with scratches but this pin is much more damaged than what was described. It is not a couple of simple scratches, but rather a very deep and noticeable scrape/fracture. The pictures shown on your listing did not properly depict the damage on this pin. Not only that, but there are a couple places along the edge of the pin where the finish has been scrapped off as well. It is obvious that this pin has been dropped and/or badly battered and for these reason I am requesting a full refund. Please let me know how to print the return label. Thank you for your understanding.


I do feel as if my description and pictures adequately described the condition of the item and that the buyer's description that ""It is obvious that this pin has been dropped and/or badly battered"" is a bit too much. It was advertised twice that I do not accept returns - once by default under the Returns description and a second time in the item description. However, I would very much like to keep my good feedback score do fear the actions of an angry eBay buyer who has felt they were cheated.

Ebay,Tricky question about how get a cheating seller to do the right thing,"I’m naturally longwinded, and I know this story is going to be long, so I’ll start with a tldr version:

I bought a secondhand book/software study package on eBay; the seller lied about the condition of the books; more importantly, she lied about how many installations remained on the software. The dilemma: the seller overcharged me by hundreds of $ for what I ended up getting, but I've already installed the software (and I need the materials so much that I need to keep them). How do I get some of my money back? 

OK, in detail, here’s what we bought and what happened:

My wife is studying for an important licensing test (to stay anonymous, I won’t name it, but think ‘bar exam’). There are some publishing companies that make very good, very expensive multimedia study packages for these tests, and the one she needs costs thousands of dollars. It seem to be difficult to duplicate; though you can find scanned copies of the books on torrent sites, you can never find the software, which is the most important element in the package. The software includes hundreds of tests that, as much as possible, simulate the actual test and test conditions. Once installed, the software also regularly downloads updated data and adjusts the questions accordingly. In addition, the software works with DVD lectures that are also included. My point is—the software is important.

It’s also the reason the package costs thousands instead of hundreds of dollars. In this regard, the company really sticks it to their customers. Not only do they sell this book/DVD/software package for thousands of dollars, but the software is designed to become unusable after 18 months (so they’re really only renting it out), and in that time, it can only be installed three times (for example, on the office computer, the home laptop and, say, once more if one of those computers dies).

Needless to say, it’s also non-transferable; the user agreement stipulates that leftover installs may not be transferred to another user. To that end, all three installs must be registered to the same user.

Despite this, eBay is full of people selling used copies of these packages. This is a great way to go for those (like us) who can’t afford to pay retail, and it’s great for those who want to get back some of the money they forked over to buy it; ideally, an original owner would install the thing once, pass all the tests in the series in 6-7 months, and then sell the package with two installs remaining and a year or so left on the license. In our search we found that these kinds of deals tend to be listed at $600-800 and end up selling for around $1000-1100.

So, we found a package listed at a usual price ($650). Good so far. Even better, they promised the thing wouldn’t expire until 2014, they claimed the books and all materials were clean and in great condition, and, best of all, they said the software had two more installs remaining.

This was perfect for us, especially the fact that there were two more installs; our laptop is a little shaky, so in the worst-case scenario, we’d still have another install if it died on us. In the best-case scenario, the computer would last, my wife would pass, and we could sell the package again and recoup maybe $500.

So, we bid and won (thanks to a few snipers at the finish, the price was on the high end of the scale at $1,200). So far, so good. The package arrived and the first thing we noticed was that the books were thoroughly marked up. Not a good sign, but since we’d already downloaded pdf scans of the books, we decided my wife could print out whatever clean pages she needed.

 Then we found we couldn’t install the CD ROM because the seller’s name wasn’t the name used in the original install. We emailed her and asked what name to use; she replied that she didn’t know, claiming that she had never actually installed the disc. She said she was actually the second owner and claimed that she’d bought the package on eBay but then thought better of taking the exams and decided to resell it.

Now this was very worrying. In her ad for the package, she claimed to have used it to pass the tests—a lie. Also, if she never installed the software, how could she know for sure how many installs were left or when it expired (info it doesn’t give until it’s installed with the proper name)? Anyway, we got her to send us the original seller’s name (btw, we got the seller’s eBay ID as well, and he rated our seller as a terrible buyer). Fortunately, this new named worked, and we were able to install the software. 

 The first thing we noticed was that the expiration date was Dec 30 2013. That’s not really 2014, but it’s close enough that it can’t really be considered a rip-off.

Then we saw that there were no more installs remaining. They advertised two, but there was only one. When we loaded it into our shaky laptop, we were using up our only install—if the computer dies, we’re out more than a thousand bucks. We don’t expect it to die, and hopefully it won’t, but even in that case, we have no more installs to sell when my wife passes the exams (there’s nothing to sell now – the CD ROM  is unusable and the books are all marked up), so we’re out the $500 bucks we probably could’ve gotten. Yes, we did get functioning software, but however you look at it, we’ve been cheated.

I sent the seller an email asking, essentially, “What the hell?” and her pathetic answer was that, oh, yes, she had installed it, but THEN she decided to give up on the tests. According to her, the false advertising was an accident; instead of writing new (accurate) information, she just copy and pasted the ad written by the guy she’d originally bought the package from. She claimed she didn’t realize that the ad said the books were clean and there were two installs remaining (you’ll note that this contradicts what she claimed in our first exchange when she said she’d never installed it).

I don’t know what I should ask for in my next reply.

Here are my issues:
A)	I got cheated by a seller who made false claims about her item
B)	I can’t really return it, because, by installing the software, I have rendered it useless to others
C)	I’m not sure I even have any rights in this matter, because the publishing company clearly states that such transactions are illegal
D)	I’m pissed and I want this jerk to refund something—I think $500 of the $1,200 I paid is fair.

For those who made it all the way through to the end (and I thank you if you did), how should I proceed?  How can I get her to make this right?",11,5,2013-02-11,EBAY,0.06933251582086086,0.9030360281467438,0.027631422504782677

Paypal immediately asked me to courier them the Razr I had received instead of my iPhone.

Ebay,Seller cancels my auction win claiming the Laptop is faulty while simultaneously listing an identical item,"I was very excited to win an auction for a new Latop on the minimuim bid, what a bargain and I immediately paid (07.02.13).  I was even happier by the fact the seller has 100% feedback and has sold many identical new Laptops including to a friend of mine who was over the moon with his purchase despite paying a fair bit more than my winning bid. 

Yesterday, a day before the seller had agreed to ship I received a message from him claiming the laptop was from a faulty batch and he had cancelled and refunded in full (which he had).  I became suspicious upon checking his page and finding an identical Laptop listed and open to auction.  I strongly suspect that the seller was simply unhappy with the fact that he usually lists the items on a 3 day auction and on average sells the item for £50 more than my winning bid which was on a 2 day auction and ended early in the morning which seems to be why I was the only bidder.

So far I have spoken to the Ebay Trust and Safety team that confirmed the seller has breached the Ebay policy for non-selling his item to a winning bidder or buyer. I didn't proceed with an official complaint as I wanted to give the seller a chance to redeem himself so I have sent him a message on Ebay asking him if he realises he is breaching the Ebay Seller Non-Performance policy.

Ebay,Help a newbie!,"Hello Ebayers.
I'm here to ask for your help regarding selling a collectors edition item i have in my possession. Please tell me if this is not the correct place for these kinds of posts!

I have never in my life sold anything over the internet, and I will admit, that i'm pretty confused as to how to do this.

The item i'm selling is ""Scarface Limited Edition Humidor"", which is a high-quality humidor cigar box, released only in 1000 units. I have only opened the box a couple of times since receiving it from a draw competition over a year ago, and it has been in it's original box the rest of the time, in normal room conditions. 
No seals has been broken or anything, everything is as it was when I received it.
Inside the box is also the blu-ray version of the ""Scarface"" movie.

[Here is an album with some pictures i've taken of the box](http://imgur.com/a/bP2I4)

I know the original price of this item was 999$, and Amazon now has it for sale for [620$ here](http://www.amazon.com/Scarface-Limited-Edition-Humidor-Blu-ray/dp/B004TNGLW0) . I'm willing to go under this price, since it has been in my unprofessional care for a year. 

So I guess what i'm asking you is, if Ebay is the best place to sell this item, and if you have any pointers that can help me in selling it.

Ebay,Turbo Lister and making a design template,"I was trying to find a free design for my listings but when I implemented, it didn't come out the way it shows in the example...  I understand how to edit but the one part...

Ebay,Another Scammer Bought My Phone,"I posted a message a few weeks ago when a scammer was claiming that the iPhone that I sold to them had a broken screen and they wanted money to repair it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/16n1pd/suspected_buyer_scam_need_advice/
I followed the advice that you guys gave and asked for pictures of the phone and IMEI and the person all of a sudden changed their mind and and said that I didn't have to pay (they never sent pictures of the phone's IMEI number).

A couple weeks ago I sold another cell phone (to a different person) and they recieved the phone 7 days ago according to the tracking info and today I got a message (through ebay messages) from the person claiming that they recieved the phone box and all the accessories but not the phone. I know that the phone was in the box because I checked it all before putting it in the shipping box. I even checked the only two places that I had the phone in my home and I couldn't find it anywhere. This case is a lot worse than the first because now they are claiming that they didn't receive the phone at all.

Is there any way that I could get out of this without loosing the money and phone?

Rant: I can't believe how dishonest people can be. I have sold two phones on eBay and both buyers were scammers. I know that both of the people that bought the phones were cell phone resellers based on their previous purchases so I know that they would not be happy if someone tried to scam them. How would a scammer feel if they knew that they were scamming someone that is unemplyed and their only source of income comes from eBay (not talking about me)?",13,6,2013-02-13,EBAY,0.04880857095122337,0.9201112985610962,0.031080102548003197
Ebay,Article 21 of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) Convention/Regulations,"I shipped an item to Australia via USPS in December. The buyer is saying it hasn't arrived. Typically, I always have international shipments insured. However, it looks like I missed this one when I was insuring items so it is uninsured.

I contacted the Australian post office and they said they are unable to track the item and advised:
""If the item was posted over a month ago, I suggest to put in a claim with USPS in accordance with Article 21 of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) Convention/Regulations which stipulates the sender shall be entitled to an indemnity of an amount set in the Parcel Post Regulations if item is lost, rifled or damaged.""

Ebay,I got a damaged DVD should I bring a case against the seller?,"I bought a DVD for $0.99+$2.40 for shipping. It was listed as ""like new"" so seemed like a good deal. The DVD arrived quickly but upon opening it was clearly not ""like new"". There are lots of scuffs on the disk and the case is slightly damaged, I didn''t really care about the case but the scratches on the disk were a concern. I tried to watch the movie and after about 20 minutes it freezes and won't play any further. 
 I contacted the seller to request a refund, this is their reply which came quickly:
Hi!
Sorry you are not happy but it was 'like new'...I watched 27 mins and it was fine. 
You got it for 99 cents - no refunds - correct.
(end of reply)

I contacted them again, explaining further that their listing was wrong the item is not like new. I'm not trying to scam them. I don't want a useless DVD. They should have listed as used and then I wouldn't have bought and I wouldn't be contacting them for a refund. No response to that second email for a day now.
I don't think the price I paid is relevant, they listed it as ""like new"" which means it should look like, and play like it was just opened. This DVD isn't even close to that. So the description was deceptive and they don't want to do anything about it.

Ebay,Questions about selling new items on eBay (authorized reseller and VeRO problems)...,"So...I was selling some new merchandise on an online website (not eBay) that I had purchased at a retail store.  The items were on clearance and I knew I could make a small profit selling them online. So recently I receive an email from someone saying they represented the company that makes the product and that I had to stop selling them immediately because I was not an authorized dealer. They wanted additional info related to where I purchased, etc. and the tone of the email was intimidating and threatening. I have not responded to them yet and don't know if I should.

So, trying to make a long story short, I have two questions.  1) As I understand the ""First Sale Doctrine"", after a purchase is made anyone can sell those items at whatever price they choose and wherever they are able.  But after talking with eBay they say that a claim by a manufacturer against a seller being ""unauthorized"" falls under eBay's VeRO ""Verified Rights Owner"" policy and would lead to a seller account suspension.  So what gives?  Why can't you resell new items if you purchased them?  I realize there may be warranty issues, etc. but this still doesn't make sense.  Is the way around this issue to simply list the item as used but still in sealed box and to put in the description that the item is not being sold by an authorized dealer and may not come with a valid warranty?  Will that keep a seller clear of a VeRO violation and threats from the product maker?

My second question is regarding photographs containing trademarks.  Apparently these ""representatives"" for the manufacturer's can claim that a photo containing any logo of the product can be a trademark infringement (another VeRO violation).  So does every product photo (new or used) have to be edited to remove anything trademarked?  There are millions of products sold using photos taken by the seller on online sale sites like eBay that include trademarks.  Are each of these supposed to not include any of the trademarks of the product?  I'm at a loss as to how to go forward and concerned I may have to give up selling on eBay all together.

Ebay,First time seller - return issues. Help!,"So I sold some trainers on ebay that I had lying around but had never worn. They are brand new and boxed so I thought why not sell them? 

Someone bought them on a buy it now listing and upon receiving the trainers he sent me a message asking for an exchange for a different size. Now I stated clearly on the listing that they were a UK 10 and when he replied he asked if I could swap for a 10.5 or 11. As I am a private seller and this was a one off I could not exchange for a different size as I had none.

As I'm a first time seller I stated that returns were accepted (I had in mind that if it was damaged or anything then I would accept) but not for the wrong size. I did not know that you could specify the exact conditions unfortunately.

Now he is saying he will get his money back in the end so I may as well refund him now. 

Just wondered if anyone had any advice on the matter. If I'm just gonna have to refund him anyway in the end then I may as well just do it now?

Ebay,Anyone have any advice on using ebay to sell imported Chinese artwork?,"First off I know nothing about art.  A friend of mine visited China some moths ago and returned with around 70 pieces of Chinese caligraphy and oil paintings.  He has asked me to help him sell them.

Does anyone have any experience or advice on how to use ebay to sell this kind of thing?  My initial concerns are below and I am in London, England if that matters.

Auction or buy it now? I have no idea as to their worth or how to price.

Is there a big market for this and can I list all 70 at once or would I be better off spacing them out to avoid competing with myself?

Are there better options than ebay for this?  Visiting art galleries in person?  Niche art websites?  Niche chinese art websites?

This is a rather small sub but didn't know where else to post.  Anyone know of a relevant art subreddit that might know more about this kind of thing?  /r/art seems more for just posting self made artwork.

Thanks for any help!

Ebay,"First dispute resolution, what to expect?","Never had to deal with this before.

Sold game dvds, accurately described all imperfections of the item (activation key will not work).
Some guy bought it without reading the description, shipping ended up being 2x the cost of the item due to where he lived.

He got it, got pissed because he never read the description, or bothered to check shipping before he bought it, calls me a fraud, hurr durr, dispute escalated.

""Item doesn't match the description""

""and your right i didnt read everything cause i trust the search option to be perfectly accurate""
..

The game itself is like 27-32gb or so, and the patcher is fucked, something about the p2p method it uses causes it to corrupt often.
so you often end up patching, corrupting, and needing to redl multiple times before it takes. 

I was selling the physical install, to bypass that issue (it's available online), thus noting that the key did not work, and it was installation dvds only.

But if ebay doesn't read my listing then I could see them siding with the buyer. He's raging like fuck into my inbox too, and claimed in the original dispute that he had contacted me and I told him to fuck off &amp; whatever - which I hadn't done, as I saw the dispute escalated messages before he even bothered to contact me.

Ebay,Seller accidentally listed an item incorrectly but I can't figure out how to open a case.,"I'm getting really frustrated, the phone support won't let me talk to anyone without a case number and the wesbite won't let me open a case and just keeps sending me in circles.

When I went to pay I noticed a discrepancy in the description so I contacted him and he confirmed that he made a mistake and that the model number he listed in the title is incorrect and its actually a different model (one that isn't compatible with my setup and therefore is useless to me).

Ebay,How eBay Robbed Me Today,"Let me first start by saying I have been a member of eBay for 12 years. I have had 408 transactions as both a buyer and a seller with a perfect 100% positive rating. My seller rating is a perfect 5 stars in all categories

On February 3rd I sold my old iPhone for a total of $303 dollars including shipping. After about a week the buyer paid me via PayPal on Friday February 8th. I packaged up his phone and shipped it via USPS on my lunch break on the very next business day. My receipt shows this was Monday, February 11, at 12:01 pm. Since the buyer was in Russia I chose to send it via Registered Mail despite that cost exceeding the shipping fee I had charged the buyer. I felt it was worth it for the security of knowing the package would arrive. The buyer had a “new member” indication by his username with only 6 transactions. I logged back in to my eBay account and updated that the package was shipped.

On Friday February 15th, just 4 days after I had sent the phone, I received a notification that the buyer had opened a case against me for a non-received item. I was surprised to see how quickly he was able to file this so I logged back in immediately to respond and ease his concerns that the phone was in transit. I saw that he had clicked a button stating that he had tried to contact me but I had never received anything at all. I double-checked my inbox but there was nothing from him there. His only statement about the case was

""I buy this, too many time is left and I still dont receive.""

What I found when I clicked on my case options were 3 places to address the case. It offered me the ability to enter a tracking number, respond to the buyer, and to issue him a refund. Since I shipped the package from work I had the receipt with tracking number at my desk there. It was now the weekend and I was at home. I didn’t have the tracking number in front of me but I still wanted to promptly address the issue so I chose to write him a response politely explaining that I had sent the package via Registered Mail from the United States and that it would clearly take more than 4 days to make it to deep Russia where he was located.

On Saturday night I received another notification from eBay stating that the buyer had escalated the claim and that they would be making a final decision within 72 hours. I was once again surprised that this was all happening so quickly for an international purchase so I figured I’d better make it a point to check the tracking number to verify where the package was. Although it was my day off I woke up Sunday morning and headed in to my work to check the number. Sure enough the package was still in transit as of Friday so I made a point to quickly add this very important information to whoever was to make a judgment in this case. When I logged back in I found that my only means of response was now the “issue a refund” button. The “enter a tracking number” button and the “respond to buyer” button were both gone. I tried to call both eBay and PayPal and only reached a recording saying they would be closed for the weekend. I sent an email with the tracking number asking that they please not render a verdict until looking this information up. It was frustrating not to be able to address this but I figured that even without a tracking number it would still be irrational for anyone to close an international shipping case in just 4 business days. Clearly no one could expect that even a package shipped Express would be able to clear Customs and travel such a great international distance is such an unreasonably short amount of time.

Less than 24 hours later at 4:47 AM I received a notification from eBay stating that they had ruled in the favor of the buyer and that the 303 dollars was removed from my account.

I was flabbergasted. I spent the next 8 hours jumping through hoop after hoop just trying to reach a person to talk to. It was frustrating to say the least but I knew any rational person would clearly see that an unfortunate mistake was made. I finally was able to speak to an Appeals Representative and I was shocked at how robotic and illogical their answers seemed to me. No matter what I explained or asked they simply responded with the same simple by the book answer: “I had failed to enter the tracking number on my original response.” I explained that had I known that my first opportunity to respond would also be my only opportunity to respond surely I would have made every effort to include it but this was never made clear to me.  Clearly the buyer was granted several opportunities to make his claims. Why wouldn’t I be granted the same right? Especially since getting to the proper resolution should be the number one priority, correct?

They acknowledged that indeed a mistake had been made and clearly I did nothing wrong as a seller. They pointed out my impressive track record of positive transactions. They agreed that 4 days was clearly not enough time to ship a package from the US to Russia. They looked up the tracking number and acknowledged 100 percent that the package was indeed shipped when I had indicated and that it was still on its way. However with each point they agreed with me on they still refused to stop dwelling on this one meaningless, technicality that I had failed to enter the tracking number on my first response. They said there was absolutely nothing they could do. They acknowledged that they did have the authority to grant the appeal but this simple technicality out-weighed the obvious mistake that was taking place. They also acknowledged that they had the authority to grant me a courtesy payment as well. Though, once again, this simple technicality granted them the right to deny me that as well. They acknowledged that this buyer, a member of eBay for only one month, with no history such as I had, with no positive reputation such as I had, would most likely get to keep both the money paid and the phone when it arrived. I asked them to honestly tell me as one person to another if that felt like a fair and just resolution to this case. They simply responded that “based on the technicality….yes.”

I’m sorry, but I wholeheartedly disagree.

I would like to be treated with the same respect and honesty that I have treated eBay and my fellow members with for 12 years. They told me time and time again that there was simply nothing I could do….

To this I also wholeheartedly disagree.

This is not just about the 300 dollars or the phone. Ebay/PayPal has robbed me and millions of others like me I’m sure. My only course of action now is to tell this story in hopes that the next poor, honest Joe can learn from my “mistake.”",23,15,2013-02-19,EBAY,0.04753674566745758,0.9143869876861572,0.038076276890933514

It doesn't matter what size and weight I pick. The size and weight are well within the limits set here...

https://www.usps.com/business/first-class-mail-for-business.htm?

The kicker is I can compute first class rates at invoice time.

Why the difference? Is there a way to compute first class rates at sell time rather then waiting and doing it at invoice time.

For my packages it's the difference between $6 and $2.

Ebay,Questions about shipping,"Question #1  - What is with the inconsistent and sometimes outrageous shipping costs on some items? For example I purchase a lot of older video games. I have seen Super Nintendo games (in box) where one seller will be charging 8$ for shipping, and another seller charging over 40$! This is for the exact same item, so same weight and dimensions. I would like to add that I am living in Canada, and most of these sellers are in the US. They will also provide free shipping to US residents most of the time.

Question #2 - I am seeing more and more US sellers refusing ALL international buyers including residents of Canada. Even when asked, they sometimes refuse. I can understand why overseas shipping can have problems, but refusing to ship to Canada seems silly. I have been on Ebay since 2002, and most of the items I have purchased have come from the US. I have never had an issue with shipping. Seems like you are missing out on potential sales by doing this.

Ebay,Buyer issued two chargebacks from November,"My location: Australia.

So I found out today that a buyer from way back in November issued chargebacks for two transactions, the 10th and 11th of November to be exact. 

The items were $12 and $16 respectively. 

Since the items were so cheap, I didn't bother with registered mail (extra $3.00). I think at the time I charged postage, with an option for registered. 

I have the PayPal records, but not the eBay records, since this happened in early November. Is there any way to get the records past 3 months? I searched the buyer's ID, email and name in Seller Manager Pro with the period of time set to ""All"", but nothing came up.

I tried searching completed listings, but the latest one that showed up was December. 

PayPal is asking for proof, which I do not have. 

Now, on the buyer's side of things, according to the PayPal transaction record, paid in Euros. Which is weird, since I only ship domestically to Australia. I know I posted to an Australian address, but have no proof.

I can see somebody stealing a Euro credit card and using it in Australia, but I don't know why they would use it to buy my items. And I don't know why the owner of the cards waited 3 months to issue a chargeback, rather than 1 month when they get their statement.

Ebay,"Not sure if this car is a scam, or I just don't understand the listing.","Hey guys. Long time Ebay-er, although I've never bought a car on there. I am considering buying one tomorrow. This car is actually local, but the seller also has it listed on eBay. If I buy it from him in person tomorrow, he'll end the auction early and sell it to me.

This is the listing:
http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/Subaru-Impreza-5dr-Wgn-Outb-1-NO-RESERVE-SUBARU-OUTBACK-IMPREZA-SPORT-/160975578989?pt=US_Cars_Trucks&amp;hash=item257ae4676d#section-vehicle-glossary

I went and looked at the car today, and it appears to be in great shape, exactly as described. I just happened to click on the seller's feedback, and saw something odd. He sold this exact same car back in January. Look here:

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=160949615304#ht_12926wt_1165

You can see the feedback for the sale here:

http://feedback.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&amp;userid=ctcars2011&amp;ftab=FeedbackAsSeller

The car's listed mileage has gone up by about 2k miles since January, which isn't really a red flag. The rest of it seems a little odd though. Also, he said when I buy it tomorrow he will mail me the title, because he doesn't keep the titles with the cars and can't get it until tomorrow evening. He said I will get a bill of sale, 30 day tags, all the rest. My schedule is the reason we are meeting earlier tomorrow and not after he is able to pick up the title, so it doesn't appear he's trying to scam me. He didn't know my schedule when he told me the time he could have the title back by. So anyway, does this look fishy?

Ebay,Is eBay store worth it?,"My busiest month so far I've sold about 40 items.  I want to sell more than that but the insertion fees of .50 per item are too expensive for the low cost stuff I'm primarily selling right now especially considering final value fees and pay pal fees.  I'm all out of free insertions for this month and now everything I put up for auction is costing me money (I think this is terrible eBay policy btw.  If I'm afraid to list because of fees eBay doesn't make money period).  I tried their ""fee illustrator"" for the eBay Store subscription and right away it appears to be incorrectly calculating costs with the insertion fees.  When I put in a listing of 100 items per month on their ""fee illustrator"" it calculates fees of $5 (with no store front).  That's obviously not correct.  50 listings are free.  The next 50 cost .50.  That's $25 as I calculate it.  I can't see how opening a store front really helps me and selling more than the 50 free listings is diminishing effort.  Any thoughts or suggestions?

Ebay,Should I try to fight this?,"Being a poor college student, I always look for ways to make money. I put a Windows 8 Pro license key up on eBay and it got pulled hours before completion by Microsoft/eBay, issuing an email  and strike against my account, and this being the primary reason:

That's great and all, except how can I violate a license agreement I never agreed to? I was sent the key (a promotional item) directly from Microsoft and didn't use it.

Ebay,Do you ever block buyers before they become a problem?,"I think I'm about to have a problem buyer. This guy first messaged me asking for a buy 1 get 1 free deal on one of my Buy it Now listings.

I told him I can't do that, but I will give him a discount if he buys two, and I gave him my lowest price I would give for two. Around 10% off each item. 

In the meantime he placed bids on most of my auctions. 

He messaged me back saying he found cheaper listings and some spiel about finding other items 70% cheaper and that it was my choice to wait for some sucker, etc etc. Even though I sold two of these today for full price. I did a quick search and disproved him, saying I had the cheapest one in Australia and I do. No idea where he got his numbers from.

He replies with an item number saying he found a cheaper one. 

1. It's a listing from America. We're in Australia.
2. It's an auction. No **** it's cheaper than my buy it now listing. It also has 4 days left. 
3. America's prices are generally lower than Australia's as well.

This guy sounds like a real weasel, and I think if he wins my auctions he'll suddenly have all sorts of problems that my 60 odd other winners didn't have. 

Am I justified in blocking this guy? Is there anything he can do to damage me if I do? I'm getting a really funny feeling about this guy.

Ebay,"I will be deleting my eBay seller account and this is why. Please share this, because I think eBay has SCREWED their sellers for long enough, we need to take a stand.","I sell gold on eBay. As you all may or may not know, gold fluctuates in price daily. Over the last few weeks, I have been trying to sell more gold than usual (because I have clients trying to sell faster) and have come across this rampant catch-22 conundrum. 



I thought this was an isolated incident that happened every now and again when I sold regularly, but now that I have really increased my gold auctions, I see that this is running rampant. Buyers with a 0 feedback rating will bid up the price of my gold so that others will not look at it or buy it. Then when the item expires they do not pay. I am forced to wait 4 days to open an unpaid item case, and another 3 days to have the gold sell again. That's an extra week turnaround. In the constant moving prices of gold world, this is an ETERNITY.  I suspect that it is other eBay sellers (of gold probably) trying to screw sales, or have people bid on their stuff, and/or keep prices artificially inflated. However, I have no way of proving that aside from looking at many previously ended auctions with a 0 rated buyer. After speaking to eBay support I am convinced that they have no intentions whatsoever of doing anything about this. They said try blocking the users. 



So I go to block the 0 rated buyers, and this is where the magic happens... We as sellers are only able to block buyers with a negative rating. We can not block anyone with a 0 rating because ""everyone starts at 0, how would you feel if you were not able to buy items"" (eBay support). However, as sellers, we cannot give anyone negative ratings because sellers ""retaliate for negative feedback"" (eBay support). The only way for a buyer to get a negative eBay rating is by selling something and having a bad transaction occur that way. This is clearly IRRELEVANT to their actions as a buyer. 



So in reality, there is no way for a buyer (that only buys and does not sell) to get a negative rating, therefor there is no way for us as sellers to be protected from these buyers. Our only option is to cancel their bids or report them, after enough reports (actual number not specified by eBay) they get warned, suspended, and then ultimately banned. However as we all know, they can create buyer accounts ad nauseum. Its only seller accounts that really care about having low or no feedback. 



I called eBay to complain and the customer service rep said ""people complain about this all the time, but we can't change it."" What do you mean you can't change it? I propose we REALLY complain, the way Reddit knows they can complain, that front page of reddit, and mentioned on countless blogs negative PR complain that we are so well known for. I think that may be the only way for eBay to see that their sellers have had enough. 



**TL;DR** - eBay has been screwing buyers, but this little bit of circular logic is the straw that broke this camel's back, F*CK EM, I'm out. In the spirit of going out with a BANG, I plead to you to spread my story. 

**EDIT: The plot thickens... One of the accounts that I have emailed wrote me back and said that not only have they never bid on my gold, but they have never opened an eBay account under that email address... Apparently someone hacked their info, created an eBay account and has been bidding on gold. Does everyone still think that the sellers should have no protection against 0 rated buyer accounts?**

**EDIT #2: After an in depth conversation with the ""owner"" of the hacked account, he informed me that his account has won 8 gold auctions in the last 2 days, essentially verifying my belief. It seems pretty clear that someone is purposefully bidding on gold to either make us go through a 7 day ""reset"" cycle to get that gold sold, or to put it beyond other buyer's limits so they wind up buying other listings' gold. Not only are they doing that, which I'm sure eBay would find against their policies, but they are hacking buyer accounts and creating fictitious accounts in the process. I really hope that eBay plans to take some form of corrective action here...**",46,14,2013-02-24,EBAY,0.12055248022079468,0.8551455736160278,0.024301890283823013

Ebay,What is WRONG with Ebay buyers?,"I've been selling some designer clothes to girls on ebay, usually in California, and they are all extremely rude and picky. One gave me a negative review on a $200 skirt I sold her for FOUR dollars because there was a single loose thread. Another said my jeans smelled bad and had me refund her the money because she immediately opened a case against me. When she sent them back, they smelled fine, so I'm guessing they didn't fit her. I rewashed them to be safe and sent them to another buyer and things were fine.

The latest is with a girl who claims the zipper is broken on the jeans I sent her. They were in perfect working order when I sent them out, so I suspect she busted them. I told her I don't do refunds but if she sent me pictures of the damage I would paypal her $10 to get the zipper fixed. I sent her the money 3 hours ago and she just sent me a message asking when Paypal is going to let her have it. What the fuck?

Here's a transcript of our correspondence:

**Her: Can u refund this one? Zipper is not working.**

Me: No refunds, sorry. The zipper worked when I sent it out and it's only a $10 fix at the tailor.

**Her: But it's not working exactly now. Do u wanna see the picture?**

Me: I'm sorry but there are no refunds and as I mentioned, you can easily get that fixed for a few dollars. If you send me a picture I can send you $10 to get it fixed but that is it.

**Her: Here are pictures.**

Me: As I said, because the zipper worked when I sent them out and it's not that expensive to fix, I can send $10 to your paypal to get it fixed. Just send me the email address.

**Her: ID is ######  @   Gmail . Are you sure the cost that tailor is $10?**

Me: That's what I'm willing to pay because it was not like that when I sent it out. Some tailors may try to scam you but you can find a place that will do it for $10.

**Her: when you send $10, plz send me message.**

Me: Just sent $10. (this was three hours ago)

**Her: When I can get money? and Ishould pay the tax?**

Me: I sent you the payment 3 hours ago, so it's up to Paypal and not me when you can get it. It says unclaimed. (I included a screenshot.)

Ebay,"Help! Buyer missed delivery, was left a notice but they refuse to pick up or rearrange USPS delivery.","I know eBay sellers are responsible for parcels getting to the buyer and I'm trying my hardest to accommodate this buyer. I've already left them tracking info and I answer all their questions within an hour of receiving their messages. 

The latest showing on the tracking is that notice was left for them to pick up at their nearest postal office since nobody was home at time of delivery.

I've called the postal service to confirm that their package is held at a specific location, I've messaged them about it, and also left them the exact address of the location the parcel is at. Yet, the buyer insists they refuse to pick-up, nor will they arrange for redelivery. They keep saying it is MY job to arrange all that for them. Now, the postal service tells me if the buyer wants to rearrange delivery the buyer has to set up a time at their convenience. 

I'm just about to rip out my hair, if the parcel is sent back by USPS then that means I am screwed?! I've never dealt with this, will ebay penalize me when I'm trying to do everything I can on my end?",12,5,2013-02-25,EBAY,0.06927389651536942,0.9035670161247253,0.02715909853577614

Ebay,Can anyone explain what happened here? (Update to Any reason to be wary of UK based Thai importer?),"Hi all, I originally posed [this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/1836bo/any_reason_to_be_wary_of_uk_based_thai_importer/) about my hesitations in buying an exotic skin (ostrich) bag from what appeared to be a UK-based Thai importer. I didn't end up trying to buy one, but was recently checking on the seller's account to see if they had posted more listings, and saw that they had changed their seller name and their account location (from the UK to Thailand). They also took all their feedback private and are not selling anything now.

They sold a number of bags (20ish), all around the same time for $100-$250, and the shipping dates were such that the bags were to arrive late-Feb. to early-March, i.e. around now. I noticed they recently incurred one negative feedback (from a perfect rating before) but due to private feedback I can't see what it said.

Bearing in mind that legitimate exotic skin handbags definitely do come out of Thailand (though usually they are sold for higher prices than these were) - can anyone speculate on what happened here? Was this a scam? Are you allowed to say you are in the UK when you're actually in Thailand or could they have had some fancy arrangement that was legit? 

Although obviously I'm not affected by whatever happened, it'd be helpful to understand various types of scams/shady practices, in case it might help me in my future ebay adventures. So, thanks in advance for any insight.",1,0,2013-02-26,EBAY,0.03853635862469673,0.9195351004600525,0.041928574442863464

Ebay,How do you show your customers appreciation?,"I want some positive experiences!  We come here when something is wrong, but I want to know what you do to encourage your customers to remember you.

I try to be super nice and patient with my customers.  And recently, though admittedly with some risk, I've shipped items before I got payment.  One was a fellow eBay seller who was waiting for payment on her items before she could pay for a gift for her daughter.  So I told her I'd ship it now and that I trusted her, that way she'd get the 'gift anxiety' over with.  She was so grateful (and I just got payment.)

Another similar example -- A clearly veteran buyer sent me a money order and I shipped the item the day after they put it in the mail. 

Sometimes I'll combine and ship for free if a buyer wins 5 auctions or something.  I go after buyers who are clearly good investments.

Ebay,"SELLERS: The infamous SNAD (Visa Code 53) charge back, do I have a fighting chance? It could happen to you!","1. Sold iPhone 5 to buyer in Maryland on November 10th (with signature confirmation/Paypal verified address.) 

2. December 10th, she leaves me positive feedback saying ""great item and fast shipping."" 

3. Buyer contacts me on December 19th letting me know that the speaker does not work and asking for advice. I advise her on her options, work her through the technical aspects of restoring the phone, etc. I do NOT deny her the ability to return the item, but I do advise her that an Apple store will replace the device at any Apple store. 

4. Buyer contacts me from Russia on December 21st, tells me that I can send her a replacement to Russia via DHL and upon receipt she will send the broken iPhone back. She says that she took it to a shop in Russia (there are no Apple stores there) and they told her that it was a software problem caused by ""the unlock that you guys did"", the phone was factory unlocked so this is obviously not the case.

5. Knowing that charge backs require the buyer to attempt to return the item to the seller, I completely ignore her Russia message. I do not want to deny her a return in any way. 

6. February 25th (3 monts after purchase), I get an email at midnight from Paypal saying that she filed a SNAD chargeback with her credit card company. The money is yanked from my account and I am informed that I am not covered by Paypal's Seller Protection because it is a SNAD charge back (I knew this already because I like to stay informed on this type of stuff.) She NEVER tried to file a dispute with Paypal/eBay, she went straight to her CC company. 

7. I call her today and she tells me that she sold the phone in Russia and that the people she sold it to threatened to hurt her family if she did not return their money. So she did, without receiving the phone back from them. 

I would have easily returned her money had she shipped it to me, but I was never given that option. I have uploaded all the messages, signature confirmation, and positive feedback screen shots to my Paypal case center. I even threw in the original pics from the auction of the phone.

Do I have a fighting chance here? My research has led me to believe that the credit card company sides with the buyer 99% of the time on these types of charge backs.  The worst part about this is, that if I lose this charge back I know that I will never receive my phone back because she does not even have it in her possession.

Ebay,"Between ebay and paypal, and a dishonest seller, I'm out $70 and a whole lot of aggravation.","My best recollection: 

I lost an auction and got an email for a second chance but didn't read it until after the closing date. I messaged the seller(multi year near perfect record) and he listed the item ""just for me"". I followed the directions, bid the agreed price, he accepted, I paid by credit card.

Checked the seller's profile and he had about a dozen angry complaints of scamming the same time as me - hundreds of dollars.

I have no account with paypal, and when I tried to create one, it would not. I filled the ""Contact us"" paypal form multiple times with nothing but automated responses, ""create a paypal account"". Finally I get a email ""Thank you for contacting PayPal. I am SO sorry that you have been given the run around..."" Asked for information and to give it through the ""Contact us"" form, *no record*, of course. After that and all other inquiries on my part were back to automated responses.

Ebay,Scammed by an international buyer. Please help or offer advice!,"In December I sold a nintendo 64 package worth over $120 to a buyer in Germany. However, because tracking international would have been an additional $20, on top of the $20 to ship, and required me to register. I declined. The buyer had a great record: over 400 ratings and still 100%. 

Fast forward to last month (middle Jan), the buyer filed with paypal for lack of receipt, claiming he never got the item. Convenient, since I told him I did not get tracking. Paypal grants him a full payback as I cannot provide a tracking number proving he has the item (obviously I can't, short of going Liam Neeson on his ass. Sadly I don't have a very particular set of skills). Following heated email exchanges, the buyer taunts me that I have no way of proving he has the package as I know no one in Germany and have no tracking.

Also, I have confirmation that the package left the US on time, backing up the case that the probability is on my side that the buyer received his item.

Ebay,Uh oh... new to Selling on Ebay and thought Reddit might have some advice for me... This sub looks like a ghost-town ...,"I am new to selling on Ebay.

I have had three(3), seven day auctions finish in the past 3 days.

The items I am selling are probably considered memorabilia and I have bunch of the exact same item for sale.

I was pleasantly surprised when the first item sold for much more than expected.  That was 2 days ago.  The buyer has not paid for their item yet.

The remaining two auctions finished this evening, about 3 hours apart.  Turns out they were won by the same buyer...  The same buyer immediately paid for auction that finished first, and I left positive feedback and packaged their item.  A couple hours later, they win the 2nd auction.  Have not paid for this one yet.

Neither auction that remains unpaid have responded to communication, and I know Im new, but all signs are pointing to 'buyer does not want to pay' from my point of view.

Ebay wants me to wait until 4 days have passed, when it seems the only recourse anyways will be to leave negative feedback and relist the item (no listing fees anyways)? Is this all there is to it?  Is there anything else I could/should do? 

Ridiculous I have to wait 4 days to relist when the ""2nd"" buyer clearly didnt intend to win 2 items, as per their prompt payment on the 1st item, and dead silence on the 2nd.
