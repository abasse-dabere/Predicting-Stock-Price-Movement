Ebay,IAMA former Ebay customer support representative. AMAA about Ebay.,"Hi there!

I‚Äôve been active in this sub on my other account for a long time answering questions. I recently left the company and wanted to take this opportunity to answer any questions everyone had. 

Understandably I cannot go into full details about my exact position. They‚Äôre many different teams and areas within the customer support side of things.

I have verified this and my position with the mods here. 

I will answer questions throughout the day! 

Note: this is not affiliated with eBay in anyway. All thoughts and opinions are my own and are not reflected by eBay. 

AMA!

Edit: answering sporadically now. I‚Äôll be back to answer when I can! Keep the questions coming.",294,67,2019-02-01,EBAY,0.04449436813592911,0.9262083768844604,0.029297318309545517
Ebay,Is eBay flipping okay? People from a Discord server I was in think not.,"I found a sound module on eBay for half the price it usually goes for so I bought it and am waiting to ship.

And I don't know how or why I thought it was a good idea (probably because I'm autistic), but I ended up telling people in a music composition discord group I was in that I was gonna eBay flip, and someone told me it was incredibly despicable and disgusting.

I immediately felt bad, but I decided not to retaliate, so I just simply replied with ""üòê"" and left.

I was incredibly hurt for the next 30 minutes, and hated both people and myself. Why must I be like this.

I found an invite link to the server I left to see what people said about what I said, and people just took my words out of context and ran with it (I said ""I'm a financially strapped teen)

one of the lead admins was like ""Talk to me about being financially strapped"" and everyone started talking about what it's like to be poor and having to sometimes steal food and stuff

I might have used the wrong words, but they cherrypicked that and ran with it

Complete lack of consideration. I'm not rejoining. People there believe that pirating software (essentially stealing) is okay. 

People are assholes, man.

Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger",73,54,2019-02-01,EBAY,0.12009769678115845,0.8475448489189148,0.03235749155282974
Ebay,"Bought item, seller refusing to cooperate or shipping it","I hope to get some advice on this one; January 14th I bought this item on eBay, and immediately paid for it with PayPal. In the list of purchases it shows I have paid so I am waiting for the seller to ship the item. 4 days later I get a message from the seller only saying ""Still awaiting your payment"". Pretty strange as I have already paid so I told him. After he send another ""No I did not receive your payment"" I sent him the PayPal transaction ID and the reference on my creditcard statement. Several messages pass until he insists I contact the customer support. So I did, I ended up calling customer support 3 times, the first time eBay told me that there is apparently an issue with the seller's PayPal account. The lady told me he either has to accept the payment, entered a wrong PayPal address or has not verified his address/phone number. I also wrote an e-mail to PayPal explaining the issue but to this day (16 days later) I did not get a response to it. After I told the seller this he said he did not believe me as he receives payments for his other items just fine. I call up eBay again and they tell me they are not allowed to initiate contact with the seller by phone, so they sent him an e-mail explaining how to fix the issue. Seller then messages me to accuse me of sending fraudulent e-mails and proceeds to create a despute against me with the description being ""Buyer is a fraud, sending fake emails"". As soon I see this I call up eBay again, having to explain everything once more and I was told not to accept the claim as the order will get canceled WITHOUT refund. I proceed to deny the claim writing my situation again, in the meantime the seller says to have blocked me making me unable to solve the matter myself. After I explained my part on the dispute page, the dispute claim automatically gets closed by eBay and since then (8 days ago) I still did not get any update nor refund on the item.

Any advice on how I should proceed? I feel like calling their customer support over and over again gets me nowhere, they told me they ""can't do anything more in their current position"" as they are only customer support. PayPal custom support seems non existent so far. Can't get any hold on the seller either. Any way I could still get the seller to ship?",16,25,2019-02-01,EBAY,0.09580647200345993,0.8794348239898682,0.02475867234170437

Ebay,"eBay will soon require sellers to upload tracking/reference number before the estimated delivery date, however some items don't have one.","I just [received the following email](http://imgur.com/a/gYhCLHw) stating that from March, all sellers are now required to upload a tracking/reference number to each item they sell before the estimated delivery date. 

I send all my items standard 2nd class via royal mail, when sending a small parcel Royal Mail attach a *reference* number to the item that I can use to check if the item has been delivered. 
. However sending large letters it is Royal Mail policy to not always attach a reference number to the item, and for large letters under 100g it is impossible for a royal mail post office to attach a reference number to it. 


What are normal sellers supposed to do under those circumstances, if the item you're sending does not have any sort of reference number to it, how can I attach it. 

Quite frankly I think this new policy is a waste of time, I get that it will stop buyers from opening a INR case agasint you as the tracking can report it has been received automatically. But after saying that, if I get a INR case, I simply uploaded the tracking/reference number when requested.",32,8,2019-02-01,EBAY,0.03941486403346062,0.9345787763595581,0.026006337255239487

Ebay,Running eBay out of rental property,"Is anyone here renting and running their eBay business?

Ebay,Returning an item not as described,"I purchased a handheld video game console which was described as ""hardly used"" and ""perfect"", among many other superlatives in the description. When it arrived, it had a ton of scratches on the outside, discoloration on the top, and scratches on the screen + dust under the screen.

I messaged the seller about a refund and they seemed willing to help. They offered a full refund.

So I asked them if they could send me a return label, and they said ""I don't know how to send one so it would be a lot easier if you could ship it for me. It won't cost a lot at all"". 

This item is going to Canada from the US, so I'm sure it'll cost me at least $10.

Isn't the seller supposed to send me a free return label, since the item was not as described? Or am I supposed to pay for shipping?

Ebay,My eBay 3 biggest pet peeves,"Had an account since 1999. Some selling some buying. Lately selling but my three biggest pet peeves are:

1. Sorting by ""US Sellers only"" and purchasing, only to have chinese characters in your paypal receipt that translate to a Chinese company who specializes in such middleman transactions. The username sounds totes American.
They go a few pennies under the lowest US price (sorting worldwide finds the same company shipping from China at a greater discounted price than the US). That means they get the majority of sales and control the pricing for everyone else.

2. Tee shirts that are obvious knockoffs of bands (Rammstein, in particular) from some Boris in Bulgaria with a screen press. You can report all day long, but they stay up there, keeping the price of real merch filtered out by low-to-high searches.

3. Receiving an eBay item shipped from Amazon fulfillment. I mean, there is NOTHING that indicates the item came from eBay. That is a bot account set up by a corporation, and that money goes into the corporate ether, not a human's pocket.

I think I might have to start my auction descriptions as me being a human, not a business, and located in the United States.",69,43,2019-02-02,EBAY,0.029858754947781563,0.9352968335151672,0.03484437242150307

Ebay,Ending a listing early fee,"Hey!

So I thought I had removed a listing for my laptop on ebay, and it turns out the post was never deleted. 

I woke up to a bid on my laptop for $350, but someone is meeting with me today IRL to pick it up for $600.

I tried to unlist the item, but I saw that I would be charged a fee on ebay.

Does anyone know how much this fee might be? Thank you",3,4,2019-02-02,EBAY,0.0349680595099926,0.9305565357208252,0.034475378692150116
Ebay,What Should I Do?,"Hello all! I don't venture into Reddit like this very often but I have an issue and I'm not sure what to do. In early to mid January, I listed some items for sale on ebay. I have done this in the past but it had been a year or two since I last did so. The next day, one of the items sold, my old amazon echo dot. Pretty much immediately I printed a shipping label straight from ebay, as well as the receipt type paper, packaged up the dot, and sent it on it's way. Made sure ebay updated with tracking information and everything was good. 

About a week later I receive an email saying that I have a message. It's from the person who bought the echo claiming that the address on their account was wrong. Only the street number was wrong, not the street name, city, zip code, etc. I thought that was kind of strange because it was a completely different number so it's not like they mistyped one number and didn't realize. Anyway, I went and checked the tracking to see if it was still in transit. I figured if it was, maybe I could contact the postal office and they can maybe stop it or return it to me or something, I don't know. But when I checked the tracking, it said it was already delivered. 

I message her back and tell her that the package is already delivered to the address she provided, so there isn't much I can do. I suggested possibly going to that address and seeing/asking if it was there, but besides that I can't really do anything. I didn't receive a reply for a couple days. When I did, she messaged me saying that she tried going to the address and it wasn't there. She also requested a refund. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the dilemma: In my eyes, I have no reason to refund this person. On the listing it said no refunds, I did not make any mistakes on my side, and by the time she messaged me about the mistake, it had already been delivered. Am I wrong here? With the refund request she commented ""The item was not delivered and I want my money back."" I then had the options to refund the money, add tracking information, or message the seller. Obviously I did not refund, I didn't see the point of adding tracking since she already has it and knows it has been delivered, so I messaged her. I explained everything politely, how there is literally no way for me to have made a mistake when sending the package since I printed the label straight from ebay, how I could not have known it was the wrong address, and how she messaged me about the wrong address too late. 

&amp;#x200B;

My message to her was on January 22nd, very shortly after receiving the request for a refund. I have not received any other messages or feedback, and I'm not sure what to do since now that money is being held in my paypal. Apparently I shouldn't get Ebay to step in through the site because they pretty much always side with the buyer. Should I try calling them? Just wait it out? What should I do?

Ebay,From Storage Shed to Office,"Good Monday morning! I just wanted to share something positive this morning. For the last few months I have been working eBay out of a 10x10 storage unit. I had it all set up like a regular office since it had a light and one outlet. But in the summer it was going to be TERRIBLE with the heat and humidity. I have a portable A/C and I was going to hang a heavy curtain over the roll up door, but it still was going to be awful. This was 110/month and included electric and trash. I wanted a real office Soooo bad but everything was at least $500 a month and needed work.
Well, as it happens, my daughter was also looking for an office for her business. Long story short, we were able to both get offices in the same building and the owner gave me a DEEP discount since we were getting two at once. So for $175/month USD, I now have a 15x20 office inside a secure building that includes water, electric, trash, and has a bathroom. It was such a happy day yesterday, moving in and setting up!!
There's also a 20x20 conference room that no one uses and the landlord said if I need to expand for just storage that he'd add it for 100/month. I'm feeling so positive today!! 
BONUS: I'll be able to see my daughter more since she's married with a baby, going to school for her masters, and running a business that deals with state bids.

Ebay,"My CPA says I need to collect sales tax from ALL buyers, not just those in my state...","So the title pretty much says it all. I recently started selling on ebay and I decided to talk it over with my CPA to make sure I'm doing everything correctly. She says that I need to collect sales tax from all customers. I've always heard it was just from  customers in your state, so I asked her if she meant just from customers in Alabama (my state). She said that I'm supposed to collect sales tax from everyone, no matter where they are located. Has anyone else heard this?

I talked to eBay and since this was a local pick up, the buyer had a chance to test drive the vehicle, check it out in person and it is a 20 year old vehicle the buyer has no ground.

Ebay,"Sellers who utilize the Make An Offer function, yet refuse any offer of even a penny less than asking price, why do you do that?","TL;DR - Why do sellers give the option to make an offer, only to reject literally any offer that's not exactly list price?  

To clarify, I am not asking why a seller would reject a ludicrously lowballed offer nor do I fault sellers who unintentionally implement the offer option due to inexperience or an oversight during listing. Rather, I am solely addressing the sellers who explicitly state that they will literally take not one penny less than the asking price. 

I hypothesize that the primary reason for this phenomenon is not inexperience or oversight; rather, this tactic is intentionally employed in order to artificially and deceptively incentivize potential buyers to click on the listing, which is made more attractive with the coveted ""or Best Offer"" subtitle. Ultimately the goal is to garner a higher click rate and thus increase the chances of a sale. 

If my [admittedly cynical and bitter] hypothesis is correct, then this is a profoundly shady tactic and makes me wary of continuing to use eBay as my primary online retailer. Most other retailers don't have the advantage of price negotiation, but the difference with them is that the non-negotiable pricing structure is known by and agreed upon by both parties well before the transaction even begins -- there is no room for this type of false advertising, so to say. 

I'm frustrated because I buy a LOT on eBay -- multiple transactions daily, often -- so I encounter this at least once a week, if not several times more. If you happen to use this technique, can you provide some insight into it and why you do it? As it stands, I can't see any non-shady reason to intentionally do it, but I have a fully open mind and am more than willing to consider your reasoning. 

Thank you for enduring this ridiculous wall of text that was easily summed up in a single sentence tl;dr    :P",38,3,2019-02-05,EBAY,0.043076567351818085,0.9237802028656006,0.03314319625496864

Ebay,eBay denied my case,"Ok so a couple of weeks back i had won a bid on a high priced item worth $350.

I checked all around my house and the item is nowhere to be found.

Ebay,Paypal: Any benefits of having an OLD account as a seller?,"Whether they're perks through Paypal or maybe some kind of benefit one can reap  from outside of Paypal, are there any benefits whatsoever to having an  old account?

Now when I say ""old"", I  mean old. I don't mean an account old enough to be confirmed (which  would then allow payments to come through quicker, seeing as how you  become verified as a ""trusted"" seller shortly after you register), but  rather a 15+ year old account.

This just  crossed my mind the other day and I was wondering if my account has  turned into that 20-year-old shirt that I think is priceless, when in  reality there's really nothing objectively valuable about it, so any  help I can get with knowing if there are any differences between a  20-year-old account and a 1-year-old account would be appreciated.

Ebay,Double refund issue,"Wasn't sure whether this belonged in eBay or Paypal reddit so i'm posting it in both to see if anyone else has had this issue.



Sold item for $75

$72.75 went into my Paypal account.

Withdrew $72.75 into bank account.

 

Item was faulty so buyer requests a refund

 

Paypal balance goes negative.

 

I sell another auction which takes $19.18 off the negative balance

I deposit $53.57 via credit card to get my balance out of negative and back to 0.00.

 

I get item back and it won't let me issue refund so i contact eBay, 30 minutes later that $72.75 comes off hold and buyer is refunded and leaves me feedback, case closed.

 

Ebay sends me an email stating i owe them $75 and it will be withdrawn in 10 days from my automatic payment method.

 

So to sum it up my balance went negative $72.75, i paid off that $72.75 to bring it back to 0.00, buyer got refunded, eBay now wants $75 which will put me out $147.75 for a $75 item.",4,3,2019-02-06,EBAY,0.09657034277915955,0.8774437308311462,0.025985900312662125

Ebay,eBay Customer Support actually Helpful to a SELLER!,"Today I had a buyer send me a message stating that they did not recieve the item. I checked the tracking number, and it stated ""Delivered"", which I replyed with a message stating that tracking shows the item was delivered, and if you did not get your package you need to contact the post office.

The seller freaks out - telling me that it is my responsibility to sort it out with the post office, and that any ""good seller"" would do that. He then opened an INR case. I provided him the tracking number through his case, and he continues to insist that I should file an insurance claim with the post office and simply refund him - which I refuse to do.

Keep in mind.....this is over a $9.50 item.

He then threatens IN THE CASE to leave negative feedback if I do not refund him immediately. Well - this is the final straw. I call eBay support, and give them a quick rundown - they look at the case, and agree with me......case closed. They also state that the buyer will be blocked from leaving feedback.

Well, that last part didn't kick in, or the seller was quick - he left negative feedback.

So I call support again, and they immediately agree that the negative feedback is unjustified, and remove it.

Both phone calls took in total 4 minutes, and I, a seller, won.

Ebay,It finally happened! Ebay deleted false negative feedback!,"For a bit of context a year ago I had a situation where the buyer asked to cancel a transaction then left me negative feedback because she changed her mind after I cancelled the order. I contacted ebay countless times every time being told that they can't do anything because that's the buyers opinion and even though I never shipped anything to her it still counted as a transaction.

Now this year I'm selling my old macbook, it is an excellent laptop at an excellent price due to it having a battery charging issue. It got loads of interest and finally sold. The buyer paid instantly and then spammed me 23 times requesting I send to an alternative address, this alone set of alarm bells but decided to roll with it. I send the laptop away.

A week later I'm getting spammed ""the battery is dead""/""It dies as soon as the charger is disconnected"" I reply stating that If you check the descripion it clearly says that the battery doesn't charge but the macbook includes a brand new charger. She instantly replies angrily saying it wasn't very clear in the listing because it said it came with a brand new charger. I spend 5 minutes carefully explaining chargers and batteries are different. She eventually calls herself something undesirable and apologises, I accept her apology and reassure her its not the end of the world. I continue to help guide her through how to fix the laptop, providing links to parts and tools, she thanks me and I think all is good. 30 minutes later I check my feedback ""dead battery not mentioned in description.""

Ebay,The worst buyer's of all: PayPal Credit,"We  all are starting to know of mail forwarding companies scams where the  buyer says he didn't get it, but this is worse and it seems fairly new:   Paypal Credit.

Sold  an iphone X, buyer received it and a week later sent me a picture of  the phone without the screen on it and told me he bought a mod chip to  solder into the phone that would allow the phone to be backed to a  previous IOS so he could jail break it but he bent the cable for the  screen and can't use the screen and asked me to mail him a new screen.   Before I could even respond to his message, he opens an eBay dispute.

Called  to tell them the buyer opened/damaged the inside and they said we can't  do anything it's ""seller make it right period"".  Eventually get an  American rep who closes out the dispute.

Next  the buyer opens a PayPal dispute saying the screen is broken, I call in  and say the buyer broke the screen putting a mod chip in and they ask  me to screen shot the ebay messages and they would contact ebay to  confirm the buyer damaged it.  Wait a week and  I call paypal again and  this time the rep tells me to 3 way ebay and ebay confirms to paypal the  buyer said he broke it putting in a chip. And paypal tells me he will  close the case in my favor.

A  month later it's still not closed, Paypal  says it's handled by a back  office since the buyer paid using ""PayPal Credit"".  I already knew what  was going to happen, I tell them PayPal is just going to protect itself  because PayPal paid for the item, but both reps tells me no you will win  this case, don't worry, and cases are decided fairly.

Today,  7 weeks after the paypal case was first opened I get a message from  paypal saying to give the buyer my return address.  I call paypal and  the rep said I'll send a message to the back office but couldn't do  anything else.  I ask for a supervisor and who feeds me the same B/S ""we  can't do anything, I'll ""ask"" the back office to re-review it"".   Eventually the guy gets frustrated with dealing with me tells me ""Well  we have to allow him to return it, if not, he may never pay us back"".

While  we all know Ebay and Paypal doesn't decide cases fairly, normally if a  buyer alters and breaks the item the seller wins, but here PayPal is  just protecting their own asses and saying no we have to allow a return  or else the buyer isn't going to pay us back on his loan!",12,12,2019-02-08,EBAY,0.07008553296327591,0.898106575012207,0.03180796653032303

Ebay,Question About Selling Digital Products (Ebay Product Templates),"I recently bought a template from an Ebay seller to use when I sell items. 

The delivery method said that it would be shipped by mail, so I assumed I would get a disk or USB. But right after I paid, I got an email from the seller sending me the html file as an attachment.

I thought it was against Ebay's TOS to sell digital products that way. But the seller has been doing this for a long time and has a lot of good feedback.

I actually asked the seller about this and they said that this is allowed when they are offering design services. There was a little bit of customization because they inserted by ebay user name into the template, but for the most part this was a prepackaged on size fit all template.

Is the seller correct? Is this allowed?

To be clear, I am not at all interested in getting the seller in trouble even if it is not allowed. The reason I am asking is that I would be interested in selling some digital products, not templates of course, and am curious about this. I looked through the User Agreement and could not find anything specifically about this.

I would appreciate learning more from ebayers knowledgeable about this type of item,

Ebay,Received a laptop that was damaged during shipping. Seller not cooperating with refund. Help!,"I‚Äôm sorry for the wall, but I could really use some help and advice.


I received a laptop that was damaged during shipping by USPS, and the seller is being difficult. I took photos of the damage to the box, which was a sizable puncture, and the gouge/dent on the laptop. The laptop will not power on, nor will it accept a charge. I sent these photos and an explanation to the seller, and told them I‚Äôd be requesting a refund. Then, I officially asked for a refund through eBay.



The seller replied and told me that I need to take the package back to USPS and refuse it, or, since I‚Äôm the buyer and paid for the shipping, I need to file a claim with USPS.




After hearing this, I called eBay, and the representative said all of what the seller told me was incorrect. She said that the seller should send me a shipping label, and that I should return the item. She also said that the photos I provided were adequate for the seller to give to USPS to demonstrate damage during shipping.




I replied to the seller with this information, and the seller replied saying: ‚ÄúBuyer is responsible for all shipping cost Based on USPS policy, if I file a claim for you, you still need take package to local Post Office for inspection -- Please also keep all packaging material too. Looks like damage is caused by USPS handling, the best might be taking damaged package to local Post Office and return to sender. When I receive the package, I will issue full refund including shipping cost you paid. In addition, this is a no refund item. But in this case, if you return it back without a damage proof from USPS, I will accept it and issue partial refund after exam returned item. Sorry for the inconvenience.‚Äù



I called eBay, and an Escalation Specialist told me, again, that what the seller told me was not true. They told me that ‚Äúno returns accepted‚Äù does not apply to damaged items, and that the seller will need to provide me a return label. They said that eBay cannot interfere until Feb 15, but if the seller hasn‚Äôt provided a return label by then, eBay will intervene.

My question is this: what should I do? Who is liable for filing a claim with USPS ‚Äî buyer or seller?

Ebay,"Accumulating ""Quantity Sold"" On Slightly Different Items?","I re-sell an electronic device, and a main competitor of mine uses a single listing to sell theirs. Opposed to me, making a brand new listing for every different one. So they are accumulating their ""amount sold"", and I think this is literally the only reason they are keeping up with me, as:

1. My price is much better (up to $50 less)
2. I offer returns
3. My listing descriptions are meticulous, offering every single bit of info to the buyer
4. My feedback rating is better
5. The condition of my item is better, as I do not sell any with considerable damage and he/she does
6. I offer much more with my listing, some of which are brand new peripherals/accessories

Still though, the fact that he is able to sell his at $40-$50 more than me, and keep up with me, makes me realize how valuable the ""amount sold"" feature can be to buyers. 

So I was wondering. On his listing, he just keeps the same 3 pictures or so, and describes that the item will be different than the one shown, as it is for display purposes. But I really do not like this. I want my buyers to see the exact item they are getting, with every little flaw, set up the way they will receive it. 

Keep in mind every single one of these I am selling is the same exact model, just in slightly different condition and with a slightly different price, depending on condition. 

Is there any way I can take advantage of the ""Quantity Sold"" feature, while letting each listing be different with its own pictures, description, price etc?

After spending a longtime searching for a great laptop with a good price, I found one. But the price has me worried. The price on it's own is 1,525 Canadian dollars. Along with it comes 90 dollars in shipping and there are no import charges which I found weird as all the other laptops had these incorporated, but I didn't stress over that. I went to the cart and there was no taxes added. I checked the, well... Checkout and the price was put in U.S. currency, which is whatever but still, no taxes added. Perhaps due to it being in U.S. currency? My address is inputted in the checkout so it should know it's being sent to Canada, not to mention, I'm using the Canadian version of the website. I worry the price will skyrocket with the tax to $1900 and I don't want to destroy my bank account. Is the tax included on the laptop? That never happens. I trust the seller as over 36 laptops were sold already, so I'm firm this is the laptop I'm getting, but it might not be if the price increases to $1900 with tax or even import charges. The seller by the way, I believe is from the U.S. Don't know if that helps give a better answer. This is the first time I'm using Ebay, so I don't know everything on how it all works.",11,3,2019-02-11,EBAY,0.033429376780986786,0.9173989295959473,0.04917169734835625

Ebay,Returned item with broken seal,"Hi all,
I sold a new face product on eBay recently, and the buyer immediately filed for a return, claiming the seal was broken. I had photos of the item with the seal clearly intact in the description.

I agreed to the return, the buyer has sent the item with a tracking number (haven‚Äôt received it yet). At first they agreed to pay the return postage, now they are demanding that I transfer them money for postage.

I won't have items delivered home anymore that are expensive, and probably will have to get a police report and open another case since the time to respond to it is over today or eat the cost.

Ebay,Item not as described and therefore worth less - but I still like it.,"Hi All,

I bought a necklace this week through a 'best offer' (new in box, but no tags) which was about 20% more than the starting bid price. The Ad explicitly states in four different places that the item is white gold.   (The title is 'white gold necklace; under metal it says 'White Gold'; under Base Metal it says 'White Gold, 9 Carat', and the description also starts 'white gold necklace').

&amp;#x200B;

It has arrived today and it is lovely, but the hallmark states 925, which is sterling silver.   
I have also just found the exact same necklace elsewhere on eBay with tags  (it's the same UK jeweller, and the necklace is very distinctive so am certain it's identical) and the picture of the tag says 'S Silver', so I'm now sure this is not white gold. 

&amp;#x200B;

I obviously need to let the seller know as the item is absolutely not as described.  However if I had known it was silver I probably would still have bought it as I don't care about the metal and I really really like it - I just possibly wouldn't have offered quite as much as I did.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I approach this please? It may well have been an honest mistake, particularly if it was a gift to them, so I'm obviously planning on being nice about it.  However I understand from here that asking for any form of partial refund is usually frowned upon (I'm obviously not going to threaten bad feedback) - but it is worth much less than I thought it was when I placed the bid.  Do I have to return it anyway (despite the fact I'd still really like it) or is there a nice way I can word this which says 'this has been missold - I still want it, but the terms should be changed to reflect this'?

Ebay,Lost 1350.00 CAD. Stolen Ebay Item. Have police report. Ebay wont open another case.,"Hi, I received a stolen item worth $1650 from an ebay seller.

It   was all banged up and looked nothing like what was pictured. I got  a   refund of $300. A few days later I realized it was stolen. I brought it   directly to the police then called ebay. Ebay said since a refund was   already made they can't do another one. I said this has to do with  theft  and a different matter. They don't care.

I   call paypal. Paypal says they need a police report in 3 days. I said   that's unlikely, I just gave it to the police officer. I called the   station the next day. The police officer left for a week and the   investigation still open. Finally it closes and after 2 weeks of the   initial paypal report I got my police report. Paypal says that since I   didn't give it to them within 3 days they side with the seller. And   that's that. I'm out 1350 CAD and 42.50 for a police report with no   item. The seller has my money.

I call  ebay again. They said the same thing as before. Sorry but screw you. I  asked if they wanted the police report. Nah we'll do our own  investigation they said.

And I just  realized he managed to get my negative review taken down... man this is  insane. I just want my money back... How did he even get it taken down? I  can't believe this. I did all the right things. Brought it to the  police immediately. This guy has my money and absolutely no  repercussions.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Problem Resolved! I contacted paypal again and was pretty serious about talking to someone who could make a decision and not tell me they'll review it again. The person sided in my favor and I just got a confirmation email as well as the money transfer pending on paypal back to my debit account.

Ebay,Buyer forcing Refund through Ebay AND issued a chargeback? Is there a risk I will be double debited?,"Sold a $300 item through ebay and it was delivered

The buyer then started a return request via ebay (reason: ordered by mistake) which was automatically accepted because I have a 30 day return policy. It says I need to refund him within 2 days of getting the item back.

Anyway my big concern is that I refund him $300 through ebay, and later he also wins the chargeback so paypal will take $300 again?

Ebay,Seller wants to take legal action,"I bought an item that was not as described and eBay refunded me through a case that I opened. The case was closed and never gave a return option. I never returned the item to the seller as I have no accurate return address and the seller states that she moved to another state, and there is no way that anything can be documented or proven for the return. The seller is now spamming my messages about the return and has stated that she will be taking legal action against me. Even went as far as sending a letter to my command. Can the seller really go through with taking legal action and am I doing the correct and likely thing?

- the seller states that I am now a criminal keeping an unpaid item and that her lawyer will get her item back

Edit
I do NOT want to keep this item and scam the seller, I haven‚Äôt returned the item for my protection due to claims that the seller has changed residences, one of the most common scams on eBay that I‚Äôve seen.

Ebay,"Non paying buyer, twice in a row on the same item, by the same buyer.","I sold an item in January and the buyer never paid, went through the process of reporting the issue and escalating and finally getting fees refunded. And supposedly the buyer gets a non paying buyer mark on his account although I have no way to see if that's true.

I relist the item, the same person wins, and again does not pay, I gave 5 days. I report, wait the extra days then get my fees back. This time calling ebay to find out what the deal is. They tell me they can change a setting on my account to prevent someone with 2 or more non paying buyer marks from bidding on my auctions to stop this person from harassing me.

Question is, how come there was no option to leave negative feedback during either of these incidents?  it burns me up looking at his history there is no visible proof of consequence.

Ebay,FedEx overrage fee nightmare,"Wanted to share a story that's taken a month to resolve. Sorry for the wall of text but it's a long story.

A quick background:

The package was 22lb and dimensions were 36""x18""x8"" (image a flatscreen TV box). Normally I ship USPS exclusively, but FedEx ground was by far the cheapest route (it's only a 500 mile delivery). I printed the pre-paid label and took it into the FedEx shop and had the customer service rep re-weigh it and double check my dimensions. She cleared it and gave me a receipt (which did not include the weight or dimensions).

Here's where the fun begins:

On Jan 15 I received my bill from eBay for fees and noticed it was \~$150 more than expected. I combed through the statement and found a FedEx fee of $168 (original shipping was $20). The $138 overage broke down into multiple sub fees including $80 oversized package and $58 in additional costs (fuel and shipping).

I immediately called FedEx and asked what the heck happened. After getting a lesson on how dimensions, fuel costs, and distances work, I explained that I had the rep at the shop confirm everything. She mentioned that the dimensions where were entered (either at the original FedEx or later during processing) where actually 126lb and 36""x""36""x36"".

At that point I asked ""Are you suggesting that I brought in a box the size and weight of a recliner, plopped it onto the counter, and the representative just picked it up off the counter (with hercules strength) without considering if the postage was correct? Obviously someone made a type along the way since it's over 100lb difference and the box is way larger than originally measured.""

Long story short, they eventually agreed to give me a ""one time courtesy"" and credit shipment $138. I said ""gee thanks"" and was on my way.

This is where the fun actually begins.

Apparently not one single representative at eBay has any idea how the process of a dispute with FedEx works. On my first call with eBay, the rep opened a dispute on the tracking number and told me it should just be a few days since FedEx had already agreed to the credit. Boy were they wrong.

I called back 3 days later and there was no progress. Then I let another week go by, and called in again, in which the rep said ""we're still waiting on confirmation from FedEx."" I suggested we do a 3 way call with FedEx billing, which eBay rep agreed to. So I got FedEx billing on the line and merged the calls. The FedEx billing rep provided the confirmation of credit, the invoice number (to eBay) which the credit had been applied to, and navigation on how to see the credit being applied. The eBay rep noted all of this down into my dispute. The eBay rep then told me, you will receive the credit prior to the direct debit of your account at the end of Jan. She also sent me an email confirmation that the credit would be applied prior to my PayPal being charged.

She was wrong.

I was charged my normal fees PLUS the $138 extra from the FedEx overage. 

I called eBay 3 times the next week and reiterated that someone had confirmed this was resolved and that I had an email showing it was done. Each time the rep said ""we do not have any confirmation from FedEx and cannot give credits over $50 over the phone."" Many of them also suggested that 'maybe FedEx was issuing me a check'. 

I waited another week. Then I escalated it to a manager at eBay who gave me the same speech but mentioned they would give me a call with an update. They never called.

Some more time went by and I assumed this money was long gone. I gave it one final shot and called eBay again. This time the representative seemed like they wanted to actually help me and reviewed all the notes. She told me that it seemed that the original rep entered a dispute and the credit was denied because they used the wrong ""credit category"" for carrier overages. She raised the issue directly to a credit 'approver' and they agreed to credit the amount while I was on the phone.

This was not a fun experience fueled by poor customer service and poor customer service. The cherry on top was that the customer requested a return (way prior to all this occurring) so I gave her 100% refund and didn't ask to have her ship it back (thank god). Not sure how I would have handled it differently but wanted to share the experience with this group.

tldr: FedEx added $140 additional charge to a shipment. After arguing, they 'credited' the shipment. eBay reps have no idea how those credits get applied to my account. Waited a month and about a dozen calls to get the money back. Customer also requested a return, so I just ate their original shipping cost too.",19,23,2019-02-16,EBAY,0.04684033989906311,0.9141772389411926,0.038982439786195755
Ebay,What is going on with estimated delivery dates...?,"I'm a seller and I offer free shipping on one business day handling times, with my primary listings all specifying USPS Priority Mail service. I have a flawless shipping record; I have never been late shipping a single item, tracking is always available as all my labels are generated through eBay, my shipping DSRs are perfect, etc. I am expecting to get Fast n Free status on most of my listings.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately eBay's estimated delivery dates seem to be completely unpredictable and without any reason to them. One week all of my listings will have Fast n Free as expected, then the next week the dates will suddenly get pushed *twice as long out* and I'll lose it on everything regardless of destination. Again, nothing changes on my end during this time, and if I go back through my orders and check tracking, nothing apparently changes with USPS either--they deliver everything on time whether the dates are normal or not.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is causing the estimations to be so fickle? This is regularly costing me Fast n Free for extended periods of time. I think I'm noticing patterns of droughts when this happens to me, and I'm worried I may even be getting actively penalized in searches for having such long delivery times.

Ebay,Weird situation,"I won a book on eBay for $5 and free shipping. 1 bid and I won. This was Tuesday. The seller messaged me Wednesday and said it would ship Thursday. Today I went out and got the mail and saw a pink ‚Äúsorry we missed you‚Äù slip. I apparently owed $23 in postage for something. The note showed there was no ‚Äúto‚Äù and no return address and no tracking.Coincidentally the seller of this item marked it shipped on Thursday with no tracking and ‚ÄúUsps priority‚Äù as carrier.

This pink slip was in the mailbox yesterday but I didn‚Äôt get the mail. My wife said during the day the door did get knocked on but she was not able to get to the door in time before someone was gone. 

So I went to the post office today and the clerk says I can see the package but can‚Äôt open it. He shows me that the sender put a first class printout on an overnight envelope. I felt the package and it was def a book. I refused the shipment because it just seemed too weird.

I‚Äôm about 90% sure it was the book I won. Not sure if the seller just messed up, I don‚Äôt see someone trying to con for a $5 book. I may even be wrong and this may not have even been the book.

Ebay,0 feedback score eBay seller orders label with correct street address but then changes label to a local business with same tracking number attached.,"After being forwarded from the idiots at eBay who denied my item not received claims, I filed a Paypal dispute for item not received. The item was a factory sealed iPhone. The seller sent a flat envelope to a business in the same city and zip code and purchased the label using my street address. I acquired proof from USPS in the intranet tracking number stating the tracking number, that it was weighed at 0 lbs, 0 oz as well as the photo scan of the item's label which clearly shows the business it was sent to. On the signature confirmation, it's just a few squiggles by someone with a different name. Paypal initially denied the dispute like eBay because the fake seller uploaded the tracking number showing same city and zip. I called, some guy with an Indian accent said it should be ruled in my favor. 2 days later, case closed in favor of the seller. I call again, a lady answers and says it's because seller showed proof that item was delivered. I said, I uploaded a picture showing he used a different label with different street address with same tracking number that he provided. Lady reopens and files an appeal according to her. I see the case is reopened. That was yesterday. Today, the case is closed again with the same reasoning! What am I going to do?

Ebay,Buyer lying in feedback,"First time poster, on mobile

A customer bought a coffee machine from us, it was listed as not working (they didn‚Äôt see that, and bought anyways). They asked for a return because they realized it didn‚Äôt work and then said that the box the machine came in had Cockroach excrement inside.

I looked it up on google, because how do you know what that even looks like. Off the top of my head I have no idea. Google said it looks similar to...get this- COFFEE GRINDS. I told the customer when we get the machines we usually test with generic coffee 

Whatever. Approved the return and explained this to them. They didn‚Äôt care. The buyer threw out the box and is now saying they won‚Äôt return it because they don‚Äôt have the box. And since they‚Äôre now out of money and they still believe this was cockroach excrement, they are going to leave negative feedback. 

What can I do about them leaving us bad feedback. If I explain to eBay can they help?",6,3,2019-02-18,EBAY,0.3146118223667145,0.6543087363243103,0.03107949160039425

Ebay,"Unpopular opinion: Ebay sides with buyers, and that's for the best.","It isn't a secret that Ebay leans very favorably towards buyers on potential cases, and as somebody who buys and sells a lot on Ebay, I know how annoying it is to feel strongly that a buyer is trying to scam me only to lose the case anyways.  

But I think that this is part of why Ebay remains successful.  

Most people who frequently browse this subreddit at least dabble in selling. Why? Why do we use Ebay instead of any other auction/selling platform? Because stuff SELLS on Ebay. Stuff that you didn't think anybody would buy. Stuff that you tried to sell on Craigslist for months. Stuff that you thought you were asking too much for but it sold anyways. And that is because there are a ton of buyers on Ebay, and the sellers go to where the buyers are. I personally have full confidence buying almost anything from Ebay because I know that if something goes wrong they will back me up. Deal looks too good to be true? Buy it. If they don't ship it then it doesn't matter, Ebay will still refund me.  

Also consider that in something like an INAD/defective item case, it is pretty much an argument of hearsay. Buyer says item doesn't work. Seller claims it worked before sale. Does Ebay have any reason to believe one party over the other? How would you resolve the case? Even if one party has photos or a video, those both can easily be faked, and even feedback is unreliable-I have sold many items to 0 feedback buyers with no issue and I have bought items from 10k+/99.9% feedback sellers where they clearly tried to scam me and other buyers. 

If you have to make a decision somehow, then you are of course going to favor the buyer, because buyers drive the marketplace.  

Of course it sucks to be a seller and eat an item cost due to a scummy buyer, but as long as you take reasonable precautions to protect yourself as a seller you aren't going to encounter true scams very often, and as long as you price your items intelligently it isn't going to destroy your bottom line to get scammed every 200 items or something.  

It sucks when Ebay decides a case in a scummy buyer's favor, but overall it is important for the market that they do so.",21,33,2019-02-19,EBAY,0.06925030052661896,0.8949600458145142,0.03578964248299599
Ebay,Advice On How To Handle Buyers Stolen Package,"Hello All:  


This is my first time posting here. I recently started selling a lot of items on Ebay as I anticipate a move and I want less stuff. Things have been going pretty well. I just got the following message from a buyer:  


 ""Hello,  
Your package was delivered to my local post office but they put it in someone elses locker and they stole it. So now I need to file an online claim and I need some information from you.  
Here is what I need.  
First Name  
Last Name  
Street Address  
City  
Zip Code  
I will then use this to file a claim on usps's website. 

Thank you for your time ""  


Does this set off red flags for anyone else? I'm not sure about giving out my information. I use a po box for my store and shipping address and I use my screen name. The buyer has recieved 286 buyer feedback responses and it's all 100% positive for the last 12 months (the buyer has no seller feedback history). The only slightly odd information is that the item was delivered to the parcel locker on 1/14, and the buyer did not contact me about it until 2/19. I understand that the buyer could have been out-of-town or any number of things, but I'm still not sure. The final value of the item (a boxed collector's edition of a video game) was about $51 (this was an auction), $64 spent in total after priority shipping.    


When I think about it, if I give the buyer the exact same information that is on the shipping labels I print (my box pox and seller name) I should be fine, right? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",26,24,2019-02-19,EBAY,0.027491813525557518,0.9302778244018555,0.04223034530878067

Ebay,"""Wish you would have made it clear this didn't fit X product..."" Title and first line of description says ""will not fit X product."" Gotta love eBay buyers! How do you handle these types of buyers?","A bit of a rant post but I think it's ridiculous the number of times this has happened on eBay and NO where else. I sell on eBay, Craigslist, Offer Up, and Etsy and I've never had someone do this to me besides on eBay. How do you guys handle these people? I usually just accept the return and move on but it's getting overwhelming. 

Here's an example of what happens: 

Lets say I sell an item which is specifically made for toyota cars and will only fit Toyota cars, which I made clear in title and description as well as the item specifics and fitment chart. The number of times people bought it thinking it would work with any other car brand and opened an INAD was getting ridiculous. So I wrote in title ""FOR TOYOTAS ONLY. Will not fit on any other car!"" Then the first line of the description is ""**PLEASE READ:** This is specifically for toyota cars ONLY. If you are worried about specifics, message me before buying. This will NOT fit Audis, Volvos, Hondas, or any other car manufacturer."" That didn't lessen the amount even a little bit. 

Then someone buys it and goes ""I purchased this, but it doesn't fit my Honda civic. Please tell me what to do"" I respond: ""This model is for Toyotas only. Please refer to the title and description and fitment chart."" Then they respond ""WHAT? Well I wish you made it more clear or I wouldn't have bought it!"" Then they open a INAD, I call eBay they tell me ""too bad"" and I have to shell out for the return shipping. 

I feel like I can't be more clear about this. Is there anything you guys have done to avoid this?",23,51,2019-02-20,EBAY,0.029221506789326668,0.9298722147941589,0.04090632125735283

Ebay,Seeking advice on handling a return (being the nice guy burned me),"Hello all. I‚Äôve bought and sold 100‚Äôs if not close to 1,000 sneakers since 2010 on eBay and have always handled returns without question to keep my reputation in tact. 

In this scenario, I bought a lot of 2 shoes both pretty used (I was well aware) for a fair price ($56) for personal use not flipping or anything. This specific model of Nike‚Äôs is called Janoski‚Äôs. I already have a few pairs that all fit in my size 13/14. This lot of 2 pairs is mixed sizes 13 and 14. Buyer accepts my offer and ships both shoes in paper bags (lol) but I don‚Äôt care as I was planning on wearing them. 

For whatever reason I receive them and begin to wear them and the size 14 is really uncomfortable and the 13 I literally cannot get my foot in. My initial thought is they‚Äôre fake but who fakes shoes of that low value? Anyway, I try giving the seller the benefit of the doubt and request a return under ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt not fit‚Äù option.

Ebay,My first Ebay return as a seller,"Just want to share this with someone to get it off my chest so I can simply move on and forget about it.

&amp;#x200B;

A buyer purchased an expensive gold and sapphire ring from me on eBay, I posted it securely and via tracked methods as usual. Buyer receives item, and then immediately makes a claim that the 'item arrived damaged'.  The ring was in a ring box, and couldn't have been damaged during transit. The message I received:  


*""Hi there, The ring has a stone missing. It arrived today and all seemed well then when I went to try it on, I noticed there was a stone missing! Can only assume the item was defective to begin with. It hasn‚Äôt even been worn and the stone fell out. I would like a refund for this item.""*  


I thought this was strange, as I'd checked the ring before sending it and all the claws of the settings were fine. I sent a reply stating that I'd be happy to refund this item if they could simply send the ring back along with the loose stone. I then received this message:  


*""Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know where the stone is.""*  


I then asked if all the stones were present when the ring was delivered and received this reply:  


""*The stone was present when I opened the package. Thanks.""*  


After receiving the ring back with the stone missing I spoke with an ebay customer support representative explaining the whole situation, and that the buyer has lost (or removed, but i didn't say this) a sapphire stone and wants to return the item. The ebay rep stated that:  


*""The buyer advised they were unable to locate the stone to be able to return this to you. We have seller protection in place on the site but we can't cover in situations like this where you have received the item back and the issue is what the buyer has advised.""*

Ebay,Issue with combine shipping on multiple items,"Hi all, I have been selling on Ebay for a while now, but the last 6 months I started selling smaller, lower priced items. I can at times have 50+ of the same item for sale, but I have had customers ask if I would combine shipping if they buy more than one. I have looked far and wide through Ebay's own instructions, and menus to figure out how to enable this for my customers, but I cant seem to find it anywhere. I fear my perfect seller rating is going to be hurt if I dont figure this out. 

I changed my promotional shipping rule to make it so buyers are not charged more than $5.50 for shipping when they buy more than one item, but when someone buys more than one item it's still charging them shipping for each individual item, which adds up to a ridiculous shipping cost.

I looked in revise my item listing to see if the was a option to add this, but there is no option to add this to listing, and I even checked inside the extra settings menu that has the gear as a icon.

Ebay,Someone Notified Me They Reported My Listing. What To Do?,"I stupidly put my modified Nintendo console up on eBay because I do not play it anymore. It was a gift from my bro-in-law years ago who knows how to modify these things, and he loaded it up with games. Hundreds of people are selling them, and while I know this doesn't make it right, I just figured I'd slip by unnoticed. Lesson learned.

So just about a half hour ago, someone sent me a message that they reported it. 

Some questions:

1. Should I remove the listing immediately? If I do so, will eBay still investigate it?
2. Let's say I change my listing description now and just sell this as a normal, unmodified console and reduce the price accordingly. Will eBay see that I made changes to my listing, and still be able to see the past versions of the listing?
3. How likely is it that my entire account will get banned? Is it more likely that the listing will just get removed?

Ebay,Can i trust seller to send me missing parts and close a dispute?,"So i bought something from a Chinese seller around mid Jan, it came in the mail in mid Feb and was missing half the parts.

I contacted the seller, seller got back to me a few days ago offering a partial refund. Unfortunately this item is useless with only half the parts.

I requested for a full refund and opened a dispute on paypal. Now the seller is offering to ship the rest of the items.

What should I do? If i wait for the seller to ship the missing parts, it will probably take another month to reach me, and by then the dispute would have closed, and if he didn't send the parts in the mail i wouldn't be able to open a dispute again.

Can i insist on a full refund?

Ebay,How does anyone make a profit with PC's?,"I make and sell custom PC's for a living.

Let's say it costs me $750 to build a PC and I sell it for $1000. ~$50 avg for shipping, and 10% final fee, which is $100. Then like $30 for paypal and like $12 for the listing. That leaves like $38 profit, less than a 4% profit margin on what would probably take me at the minimum 2 hours to create. 


That's not even taking into account that at some point I may have to ship it across the country, and that pretty much erases my profits. Is the final listing fee off, or am I correct? Is there a way to better my margins? Thanks in advance.

Edit: I've read that Ebay will deduct the price of shipping from your final value fee. Is this true?

Ebay,Free Postage or Lower Price?,"Hi guys. Just looking for a wee bit of advice. I'm in the process of setting up my shopify store but in the meantime, since I already have the stock, I have most of my items listed on my eBay store.  I've been a private seller of used goods on my personal page for years and have never offered free postage. However, when researching and comparing to competitors free postage seemed to be the recommended route.  
My sales have been slow but steady-ish. I did expect to be selling a bit more though. I'm currently offering free postage with a slightly higher selling price to cover some postage costs but by the time fees/PayPal are accounted for I'm really not making much at all. All my items are low cost items so I guess what I'm asking is would I be better off lowering my prices slightly and charging postage or keeping on as I am and hoping things pick up? Will charging postage affect the fees I am paying? 

I'm looking to see if anyone has experience of both and what worked out better?

Thanks.",9,3,2019-02-23,EBAY,0.04485829547047615,0.863632082939148,0.09150957316160202
Ebay,Almost a week &amp; buyer still hasn't paid,"Hi everyone, 

Someone bid on an item, won the auction, but has yet to pay. Tomorrow will be 7 days since the auction ended. Based on what I've read here, the best option is to do Buy it Now with the Best Offer feature and to check the box where the buyer has to automatically pay. 

However, by the time I saw this advice, there was already a bid on my item and I was unable to switch the format of the listing. All of my other listings are Buy it Now/Best Offer but I wasn't able to switch this one and was stuck with it once someone bid. 

This was a super low-value item. I was new to flipping at the time of purchase (I'm still new, but have learned a lot in a short amount of time) and really I just want it gone - whether that means sending it to her or just tossing it. 

On the 3rd or 4th day, I sent them a Payment Reminder and just used the automatic message that Ebay sends without adding any custom text of my own. Still nothing. Very confused, as this buyer has a pretty robust purchase history with great ratings/feedback.

That said, should I send another reminder? What can I do to ensure I don't get any marks on my account? Should I cancel the order? If so, can she fight it? Should I leave negative feedback on their account? Like I said I'm new to this, so I want to make sure I do everything by the book so that my account doesn't get dinged in any way.

Ebay,eBay seller uploading fake tracking #s to meet 1-day shipping and get ahead in search results. Best place to report?,"So I'm a seller on ebay but in this case was buying a cheap widget for personal use.  $9 shipped, no biggie.  Guaranteed delivery in 4 days or less.  I bought it and almost immediately got shipping notification.  COOL!

&amp;#x200B;

3 days later I got this very boilerplate message from the seller:  

&amp;#x200B;

*""Hi \[my name\],*

*IMPORTANT NOTICE!*

*I was personally checking your order when I noticed that your package is headed to a wrong address. That happened due to an incorrect carrier scan.* 

*The tracking number uploaded to your eBay order will show delivered, but not to the address on file. Please disregard any notification about that.* 

*We have already processed and shipped out a replacement and these are the tracking details for it*

*1. Tracking number is \[new tracking number not uploaded to ebay\] via UPS*  
*2. Estimated delivery date is Tuesday, Mar 05, 2019 by the end of day.*

*A response is not required to this message.* 

*Wishing a positive day!""*

&amp;#x200B;

I've been buying and selling on ebay for over 16 years.  I've never had an ""incorrect carrier scan"" cause a package to go to the wrong address.  Even if it did happen, this guy has it happen so often that he has a canned response?  And he's got the time to do the detective work to figure out exactly why a package got misdirected despite the carrier usually being unable to figure out why a package took a wrong turn?  He's also got over 20,000 feedback in the last year, yet he personally checks the tracking history regularly (and addresses once it's in transit) of every sale?  

&amp;#x200B;

Last, the initial tracking number he uploaded to ebay shows a weight 2x higher than the new (real) tracking number he provided in the message.  So there's no doubt the first tracking number is one he's getting via one of the tracking number checkers online, and from ebay's standpoint the info he sent/uploaded is proof 

&amp;#x200B;

For a $9 widget I don't care if it comes later.  Not a big deal.  But as a seller who has a 4 day handling time (and usually ships in 1-2) I loathe how he is getting ahead of us in sales by pulling this crap.  I've had to report a scammer seller a long time ago over the phone and it was a nightmare.  The people I talk to as a buyer seem to be a different group than with my selling account.  Long hold times, not understanding the scam, etc.  Is there a better place to make note of this?  This guy is a massive seller cheating ebay (TRS status) as well as honest sellers.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

Ebay,"Opened a SNAD case, eBay refunded me without return, stating I ""don't need to do anything else"". Why?","I'm wondering what happened here. I bought quite a high ticket item that turned out to be faulty, opened a case on eBay, they decided in my favour, so I was refunded and the message read ""you don't need to do anything else."" I therefore still have the item. I thought that I would be required to return the item. The seller is asking me to return it, and I'm willing to, as long as he pays for return shipping, but I want to make sure that eBay actually refunded me out of the seller's pocket instead of their own.

It may be worth noting that the seller escalated the case himself. I said I was going to escalate because we couldn't come to an agreement, but enough time hadn't passed yet, so I couldn't. Next thing I know, he escalated the next day before I could.

As a sidenote, it's quite funny how the seller's tone completely changes from accusatory and aggressive to friendly now the case has been decided in my favour and closed. He's almost trying to guilt trip me now.
