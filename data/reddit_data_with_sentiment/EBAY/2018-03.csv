Ebay,"I feel like I'm being a shitty seller, help me resolve this return problem.","I sold a phone I bought secondhand and it was blacklisted after I sold it (yes, I know it was a stupid/risky thing to do).
Now the buyer opened a return case and I accepted and sent an ebay return label. Now heres the issue, the buyer bought it while on vacation in the US and is now back in their home country so that return label won't work.

I asked him if he would send it back through his countries post office but he then pointed out the tracking wouldn't be recorded through ebay and he has no guarantee that I would refund him. So he asked me to send him half the refund back before he sends the phone back and the rest after I receive the phone back. Should I proceed?

Also he opened a case on PayPal as well so that might open a few more possibilities that I'm not aware of.

Ebay,Would I lose this case?,"Hello everyone, I'm new to this forum but I have a bit of a situation with a buyer and I'm hoping to get some advice. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated :)
Background info: I sell collectible card sets where each set contains a bunch of common cards and one special 'rare' card. A buyer bought 2 sets at once, I shipped both out together (packaged very carefully and everything), and it was delivered successfully. After delivery, the buyer reaches out and says the package arrived open and one of the sets is missing. The buyer demands a full refund or a replacement for the missing set. Unable to provide a replacement for that specific missing set (it was my last), I'm thinking...either a partial refund for the set that arrived, or telling the buyer to return that set and provide a full refund? When these options were provided, the buyer immediately tells me that not only did one set not arrive, the rare card from the set that did arrive is missing. In other words, even if I were to get it back, that set was essentially be worthless. At first I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt but this started to smell fishy. 
I read that in cases like this, sellers often make a spiel to the buyer about opening a 'mail theft' case, partially as a scare tactic but it might also be necessary. I did exactly that and requested pictures of the envelope. Sure enough, the pictures showed the envelope being completely torn up, by hand and also with scissors (weird). I understand mistakes happen but surely, a carrier would not deliver such a messed up package without flagging it. However, the buyer was not backing down so I contacted his local post office, spoke to the postmaster who looked at pictures of the parcel as it was received in their unit, spoke to the carrier, and assured me that there was no way that that veteran carrier would've delivered such an item. Now I know that that's not definitive proof of anything, but I believe I'm getting scammed here. My gut is telling me I'm getting scammed, but supposing something did happen post-delivery, would I be liable there? If, say, a neighbor opened his mail and stole one set of cards and also happened to know the rare card of the second set and stole that as well, am I on the hook?
Thanks for reading, I'm just stressed out and trying to figure out what my options are. Does it look like I have a decent enough proof? I don't know if this matters but I'm a 500+ feedback seller with power seller status and 100% feedback.

tl;dr- sent items, package delivered successfully, buyer claims (most expensive) items are missing from package but his local PO has pictures and says it's not possible. help?",14,6,2018-03-02,EBAY,0.07352281361818314,0.8919650912284851,0.03451204299926758

I ordered and item with shipping duration of 3 weeks, the duration past, I waited one more week just to be sure the item really did not come. However, nothing came. I contacted the seller and asked for refund.

The seller replied back with an offer of reshipping another item. I replied that I need confirmation first on two things:
- how long would the 2nd item the seller ship take to arrive
- do I get my money back in case the 2nd item gets lost too?

Now the seller replied with that he is just customer service and if I refund he will lose his salary and typically crying about fees (paypal fees, ebay fees, shipping fees... etc)

Ebay,Suspicious Buyer Warning,"I just received a message today that eBay closed 2 orders I have for a buyer. I already purchased the labels and was about to ship it out. The buyers account seems well established. It is a few years old and they only have feedback as a buyer, so selling activity. The account is not registered. The thing that I think is weird is that another buyer that purchased a similar product with a different account has the same shipping address as the buyer marked for suspicion. It is what looks like a business address. The names on the shipping address are different.

eBay was not helpful at all. I called, and was pretty much immediately directed to paypal and the CS rep told me not to say anything about eBay. The buyers already paid and the item it ready to go. Both items have USPS tracking. Should I call ebay, cancel the order, or send it out? I'm just worried about the buyer trying to initiate a charge back once the item is received. 

EDIT:

Lookup up the shipping address on Google. No good news. I'm going to contact eBay and find the best option for canceling the order. Hopefully I can get my money back for the shipping cost since eBay sent me the warning after I purchased the label. 

Here is the address. It's littered with bad reviews and warnings of scams.

Frustrating, but at least it is not a negative feedback.  Still, I don't like that my profile ratings are now docked under ""item as described"" and ""communication"", plus a neutral rating.

Ebay,Completely new buyer account wants me to send item to a suspicious shipping address - What should I do?,"Hello,

So I sold an item to a buyer and he wanted me to send the item because he moved out of town, the address is 8 McCullough Dr at New Castle, Delaware.

I got suspicious because I searched that address on Google and my first results were about bad buyer results and ebay scams. I then find out the address for a website that apparently sends packages to Georgia, I presume the country.

I'm not comfortable because when I asked the buyer if he has any alternative addresses, he simply reiterate the same address with the same U code. I then found out that this buyer has made his account today, the very day my auction concluded.

Is there anything else I can do about it or should I just straight up cancel? Is there any consequences to me if I just cancelled the transaction? The auction is done, but the buyer hasn't paid as of writing this post.

Thanks!

Ebay,Ebays Credit Card processing (for sellers) down since 02/28 - Authorize.net users,"Just a heads up. Ebay has completely dropped the ball big time.

Authorize.net is Ebays ONLY option for sellers to use outside Credit Processing. As such we use this option exclusively and do not use PayPal at all!

Things went smoothly until around the 22nd. At random I had to manually authorize (on my end) credit card transactions. This allowed me to capture the payment and complete orders for Ebayer buyers.

On Ebays end, the orders DO NOT show completed. Even though I had the money from said customer. I shipped those orders out anyway and all is well.

Then comes 2/28 and all my business stops cold. I figured for a few days it might be a fluke or something. I ignore the signs of the problem.

Today (3/5/18) I verify with Authorize.net that they rolled out new Certificates and Ciphers for processing security. This has been planned for over a year. Ebay was aware of this change.

Now, Ebay is sitting there, unable to process any order. I had to call them twice and call them out to verify its an actual problem.

So, me and thousands of other sellers have had no sales for a week. Might not seem like a lot to some, but thats over $6K for me.

Just a heads up!


**UPDATE:** Out of frustration, I changed my Transaction Key in my Account Settings on Ebay. Once this was done my own personal test purchase came through on Authorizes side. But then Ebay never reflected any purchase. Also, a 2nd attempt to do a test purchase resulted in an Ebay page message stating ""Your payment is still processing.....""

Ebay,Is it really important to have Top Rated Seller status?,"eBay released its 2018 Spring Seller update and it includes a big change to its Top-Rated Seller program requirements. To be Top-Rated, a seller must offer 30-day free return shipping on all purchases. I imagine this could skyrocket returns and wreak havoc on a seller's bottom line. EBay also nixed the restocking fee charges on returns. 

My question is does being Top-Rated really make a difference in profit? What's the risk of not offering 30-day free return shipping?

Ebay,Worried that eBay wont refund the final value fee,"To start, I am a first time seller so please forgive me for a possible lack of general knowledge about how these things work.

I accepted an offer from someone to buy my item, and they began messaging me on my phone and email asking for my paypal email address so they could pay me. There was also something like ""it is my cousins birthday and I need this item asap"". I informed them that I was only accepting transactions through eBay, and I sent them an invoice, as they requested. After more of the same, the scammer has gone silent. I realized that my options were to cancel the transaction and wait 10 days, or to report the item as unpaid and wait 7 days. I decided to call customer support and see if there way a way to expedite the process. I called, spoke to two representatives, and presented my evidence to them. They both agreed that this buyer was a scammer, but they said that they could not expedite the process. I told them that I understand and I thanked them for their help. I planned on filing an unpaid item report, but now I have received this email from eBay:

""We had to cancel bids for the buyer, XXXXXX, because they aren't registered on eBay:
000000000000 - Sony PlayStation PS Vita Madden NFL 13 Bundle, 32 GB Memory Card, 4 games, +More


We've also made it easy to relist your item if it was removed. Although the item is no longer available in search listings, you will find it in the Sold section of My eBay. For more information, please visit:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/relist.html

To help you avoid this situation in the future, consider setting a Buy It Now price and requiring buyers to make an immediate payment. For more information on immediate payments, visit:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/pay/require-immediate-payment.html

We recommend you take the following actions if this buyer won the item:
- If you haven't received payment, don't complete the sale or send the item to the buyer.
- Don't communicate with the buyer directly.
- Verify any payments you've been notified of by logging into your PayPal account (or other online payment service).
- If the buyer requests a refund or additional payments, don't send any money without contacting eBay first.
- If you've already sent the item, try contacting the shipping carrier to find out if you can stop shipment.

In these types of situations, we may, at our sole discretion, decide whether to credit the fees for removed listings.
- We have credited all associated fees except for the final value fee for your listing(s).""

I understand their recommendations, but does this email mean that I will not be able to file an unpaid item report? Will I be able to get my final value fee refunded? The buyers account is no longer registered, and the item is sitting in the sold section of my eBay as ""awaiting payment"". The sale happened yesterday, so I still have roughly 24 hours before I can file my unpaid item request, if I am able to. And a final question, can I relist my item immediately, or should I wait?

Ebay,Does this look sketchy to you?,"Late last night, I won an auction for something at an ungodly good price. (Honestly, I'm shocked.)

Good morning. My paypal account was compromised so I had to open a new one. This item was listed with the old account and cannot be changed. This is what we can do:
I will cancel this order and re list it as a Buy it Now and send you the item number so you can purchase it at your winning bid price. I will list it for more but with Best Offer so no one else will buy it until you get to do so. Remember offer your winning bid and I will accept it.
Thank you and I am sorry for any inconvenience 

I checked with the auction number he sent me and he does have it relisted with a much higher BIN (which he said he would do).

Best Offers on Ebay have just been getting more and more ridiculous.

Now today, there is an item at $21.99, and I offered $19.75. They declined it. No explanation, no counter-offer. 

To sellers on here, which I am as well, if you're only willing to sell a Best Offer for .99 cents, or in that ballpark, just do us all a favor and make it a standard buy it now.

A best offer is for haggling, and I understand you don't lowball people when making an offer, but these two instances are crazy and becoming more common.

Ebay,Facepalming tool time,"I don't even know where to start.
So I bought a camera bag on the weekend at a thrift shop.  I got to the cashier and we opened it up and there was still a sony handycam in it.  I paid $7.99 CDN for it so.
Anyway, they rang it up and let me have it with no issues.
So I get home and compare prices on ebay and this sony handycam is selling for $50-$120 in working / good condition.   I just needed the bag so I list it on ebay for $29 +  shipping and stated that it was untested and selling as is.  There was no battery or power cord.
Fast forward a few hours and it sells and the shipper pays.   
I ship it the SAME day and they get it within two days.
Then tonight, as I was logged into ebay, I saw that I got feedback for it but my number didn't change.  
Turns out that the buyer left me neutral feedback stating that the description didn't match the item.  I contact them about it and they pointed out that in the auto-population of this device, that the handycam played a certain kind of tape (Hi8) but that this model didn't.   I had zero to do with that.  I just put as-is in the description.
Then I click on their feedback and they left all kinds of neg and neutral feedback for other sellers.   Plus when I clicked on 'items for sale' but this buyer, they were selling the same handycam that I just sold them for $100, minus the remote and manuals that I shipped with it.

This is just another nail in the coffin.  I'm so tired of dealing with unethical buyers.

I sold DDR4 RAM on September 8th, 2017. The customer opened a case against me saying the RAM did not work which was a lie because they were completely new in package. Buyer opened a case against me but did not get resolved until November 6th, 2017 in which eBay favored on his side. eBay tried recovering the funds from my Paypal balance ($275 to be exact). They were unable to recover the funds so they refunded the customer and made my Paypal balance negative. I ended up paying eBay $275 on November 10th, 2017. 


I no longer had a negative balance and I continued to sell on eBay with no issues. 

Fast forward to February 24th, 2018 after I sold a pair of shoes for $330, eBay decided to automatically deduct $275 from my Paypal balance. I thought hmmmm, that’s weird. Why would they take away so much. Turns out that eBay claims to have never received the reimbursement of $275 from me which is a complete lie. I have records of the $275 payment I made to eBay from my bank account back in November. 

I have talked to eBay customer support about 5 times already with  little to no help. eBay customer reps say they cannot see statements passed 6 months and they need a specialist to look into it...

Well now it’s March 9th, 2018 and I have not been able to recover my $275 that was stolen from eBay.  They said it would take 7 business days but here we are 10 days later. 

I doubt eBay even cares about my issue. It’s not even my fault yet it’s taking them FOREVER to look into my case... I need my funds but eBay doesn’t care yet they expect sellers to pay their final value fees ASAP. 



TLDR: EBay deducted $275 from my Paypal balance and claim I owed them from a customer refund that took place back in November 2017 yet I have absolute proof of payment yet they still cannot help me. 



This makes absolutely no sense and I’m absolutely 100% deleting my eBay account after this gets resolved. Goodbye to the hundreds of feedback I have received throughout my lifetime as a eBay salesperson.",14,5,2018-03-09,EBAY,0.1068224310874939,0.8553163409233093,0.03786128759384155
Ebay,"Buyer purchased a broken watch for repairs(on no return sale), failed to repair and seems to created more issues with watch, has no requested a return.","Not sure what to do here, 2 years on ebay I have sold 60+ watches and this is my first negative interaction or return, the buyer purchased a watch with a barrel crown issue(small repair), and messaged me to say that the watch has too many scratchs(watch is a vintage piece well photographed and has light scratches normal for a 20+ year old piece), he complained that the bezel is stiff to turn, which it is but turned fine when I sent him the watch.
Now a day later he is claiming the movement of the watch doesn't work, which it was working fine when I sent it to him, and is a famously durable movement, he did not mention a movement issue in forst message, but 24hours later magically this serious issue has occured(not sure if he is lying or has opened the watch and broken the movement?)

However, my options for the claim are only refund, provide tracking info, or send a message. 

I don't want to straight up issue a refund because then I'm out the $150 if he eventually receives the package, right? I tried putting in the tracking info again but it didn't change anything and it just takes me back to ""choose what to do"".

Ebay,I've had to pay for postage twice - Advice needed.,"Hi all,

I bought 2 separate items of clothing from a seller on eBay.  The seller said that both items were shipped together in separate packages.  One arrived and the other didn't, until today.  I received a note from the Post Office which said they had a package that had not been paid to ship and that I would need to pay for shipping in order to collect it.  I order quite a few things online so I had no idea what it might be.  When I picked the item up I asked the employee at my local Post Office what had happened since I had never been asked to pay shipping before as I pay for shipping when I purchase all my items.  He said no shipping labels at all were on the package, nor return address, it was as if it had just been dropped in to a Post Box.

I only paid £2 to get the item but I feel I should be reimbursed for it as I've paid for shipping twice.  After all, I paid £3.90 when I bought the item to have it shipped.  So I contacted the buyer and let them know what had happened.  I stated that I was happy with the items but would like my £2 to be sent back to me.  Responses were as follows:

""Hi I’m sorry to hear that this has happened. I use the drop &amp; go service, so my parcels are addressed &amp; I state 1st or 2nd class on them and drop them at the post office. The post office process them all &amp; apply labels, then I collect the receipts from them the next day when I drop off more parcels. I can only assume that they missed one &amp; forgot to label it as I paid postage for bothout of the 48 parcels I shipped that day. So I do apologise. I’ve not had any problems with the drop &amp; go service before.""

""Hi I’m sorry but I paid the postage for both your items &amp; this was down to human error on the post offices part. I’m out of pocket as it is from selling my own jeans at such low cost. When they were £40 plus originally each. I think you have a cheek to ask for a £2.00 refund considering this. If this warrants a negative feedback than I will happily take it, but I feel you are being extremely unfair!""

I haven't responded to the seller yet but thought I would come on here for some opinions.  I did buy the items cheaply at auction but I did nothing wrong when I did so.  Also, if an error has been made at the Post Office it's up to the seller to dispute that not me as the buyer.  Lastly, I'm not wanting to issue negative feedbacks to the seller, who will probably give me two neg feedbacks as a buyer, over the sake of £2.  I'm not wanting to return the item but do feel I should have my £2 returned to me.  

Should I just take the hit on the £2?  Am I being unfair?  How best to proceed?",9,2,2018-03-09,EBAY,0.07359819859266281,0.895479679107666,0.030922189354896545

Ebay,Angry message from buyer claiming I lied about item size...,"Hey guys,
Just received a rather...unhinged message from a buyer I sold an item of clothing to a week or so ago. Item was tagged a specific numerical size (which I explicitly stated in the description) but ran large, so I mentioned that it could possibly fit a larger size and included detailed measurements, emphasizing to *please check measurements before purchasing*

Anyways, buyer sends me angry, rude message because HOW ON EARTH could I POSSIBLY think that this could fit larger and that I intentionally misrepresented this item by suggesting in the description that it could fit larger (again, I clearly mentioned the tagged size and included detailed measurements). In my listing title, I mentioned the other sizes that this item could fit and that's all the buyer seems to be going by...she is claiming that I said in the description that the item was somehow tagged with multiple sizes (the exact opposite of what I actually said) She acknowledged that I don't take returns but is demanding a full refund anyway (she phrased it in a weird way that makes me think she intends to keep the item?) and is threatening to ""take this to eBay"". 

I replied, pointing out that I was very clear about sizing in my description and invited her to re-read it. No reply yet but I'm a little unnerved by the aggressiveness of the original message (despite the numerous typos). I'm honestly wondering if I'm in the wrong here somehow and what my recourse is. I've always been really adamant about giving accurate sizing info and, again, my description was extremely clear about the tagged size. I don't even know why I'm second guessing myself but I know how eBay often favors the buyer.

ETA: they opened a return request under ""item not as described"" so apparently I can't decline. I sent them a message AGAIN telling them that sizing info was clearly stated. Not sure what to do now. They do not seem willing to budge. Is eBay going to force me to refund them?

ETA 2: Spoke to eBay, was advised to call back later in the week after 3 day ""figure it out ya self"" return case window. eBay rep checked the case, messages, and my listing and confirmed that I'd been clear in my description.

ETA 3: Just received another message from her, claiming she spoke to eBay and I'm in the wrong after all. Not sure whether or not to reply to this one but she acknowledges that ""will possibly fit larger"" is not a guarantee and flips out anyway:

*have turned you into eaby and opened a case against you// like you ssiad COULD POSSIBLY FIT A LARGER SIZE.. BUT POSSSIBLE DOES NOT MEAN IT WILL. nd like ebay stated the listing was mis leading due to the"" possibly word' i bought from merely reading your psot. which should have never been written like this*

The seller contacted me today to let me know that they didn't realize the shipping on this part would be so expensive, and  couldn't ship it to me for less than $100. They didn't want to take such a high loss on the part ($300 item ).

This is a rare item that I need. I'm confused as to how someone that has sold 1,400 items hasn't experienced this before.

Ebay,"I won an auction for a bag, but am suspicious that it is a fake","I impulsively bid on a pre-owned longchamp bag. It appeared to be near exact model of one that I really wanted and I skimmed though all of the photos and item description. 

I have never owned a longchamp so I don’t know how to tell authentic vs fake besides using internet photos and guides. This one appeared to be a more obscure model (appears to be same shape etc as the classic, but super smooth instead of grainy leather, horse logo doesn’t have a curved line/rein from head of horse to riders hands). There were some minor flags for me (no embossed horse logo on front flap; “modele” on back flap missing accent on first e; inside tag is same style clear fuzzy plastic but shorter text) but I can’t be sure if it’s an obscure model or a fake as I know longchamp has some very similar models through the years. 

I messaged the seller who assured me it was authentic and that she had received it as a gift (I asked when she purchased it). She has 100% satisfaction and 300+ reviews. But maybe she’s getting all her items from thrift stores and she doesn’t know herself if it’s fake or not? 

So question: if I go through with the transaction, and I inspect it or get my friends who have longchamps to inspect it, and I don’t think it’s authentic, what can I possibly do about it? Ebay says they have buyer protection but how can I prove that, if it’s fake, that it is actually a fake? Or does it seem suspicious enough to cancel the transaction immediately? Would I get penalized?

Ebay,"PayPal Seller Protection Ending on April 19, 2018","This is ridiculous, but I thought I'd pass along something that PayPal is sneaking in. Today I got an email from PayPal that they are updating their terms. Nothing big, nothing to see here right? Not so fast!

Starting April 19, look what happens: ""We’re updating the additional requirements for coverage of Unauthorized Transactions for sellers under our Seller Protection program to require that the payment must have been made in connection with a transaction where the buyer logged into their PayPal account to complete the transaction in order for sellers to be covered under the program. We’re updating the additional requirements for coverage of Unauthorized Transactions for sellers under our Seller Protection program to require that the payment must have been made in connection with a transaction where the buyer logged into their PayPal account to complete the transaction in order for sellers to be covered under the program."" - from https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/upcoming-policies-full

Basically, this is saying if a customer pays without signing into PayPal such as when they enter their credit card directly at check out, and the customer claims the transaction was unauthorized, the seller was on the hook. Previously we would be protected as long as we shipped to the address on the order page (delivery confirmation or signature confirmation for orders of $750 or more).

Now it won't matter if you do everything right, ship to the correct address, and even get a signature. If the customer doesn't log into PayPal when the check out (using guest checkout/entering the credit card directly) they can claim unauthorized use and we lose the money.

This means if someone steals a credit card and uses it at your store, or someone uses their own credit card but says they didn't authorize it, we are on the hook when previously we were protected.

Ebay,Member since 1997- Getting scammed out of 1250 dollars right now: a horror story,"Okay I'm being a little dramatic with my title but I'm pretty upset as I post this.. I purchased two DJI Mavic Platinum drone combos on eBay from another reputable seller. I was going to give one to a friend for his birthday but ended up getting him something different. Since I was outside the return window with the seller I purchased from, I listed one for sale on eBay and accepted a best offer price of $1250 (I included free UPS signature required shopping)

Once the buyer received the item, he initiated a return request through eBay stating the item was different than described. The $1250 now frozen in PayPal, he stated he received ""a cheap toy instead"" of what I had advertised. Immediately I was pretty mad, called eBay asking what to do and was recommended by the call center that I message the buyer.  Okay....I can do that, but not sure how that's going to help me.

So I message the guy and asked for clarification and for him to post pictures

He turns around and posts pictures of a Walmart special (sub 100 dollar toy) drone in the shipping box I used. I'm so livid at this guy, I call him a scammer in messages..I tell him I'm going to call the police,etc... I was understandably upset.. But maybe should have kept my cool a bit better

I found the drone he took pictures of and noted in the messaging system that it has a shipping weight of 2.4 pounds (per Amazon). Perhaps that can be used as evidence if eBay actually even cares about evidence in these cases- (I also contacted the previous seller of the drone and had them to confirm their shipping weight which matched mine exactly...) the guy then says.. 

Let me quote exactly:

 ""Who the hell think you are ,To talk to me like this ,your a low life scammer ,get a life . The garbage you send me it is 9 lb. It's a heavy garbage that you sent me . You stuffed the fake drone box to make it heavy and claiming that should be lower , So pethatic .""

Granted, I probably instigated him a little bit.. But to me this guy is the lowest of the low and I'd treat him no different than someone trying to walk into my house and steal something off the shelf. If nothing else maybe I can take a little pleasure in making the guy frustrated :)

Called eBay again today and they suggested that I ""accept the return"" of the item. I explain to them the buyer took pictures of a different item and is trying to scam me. That I don't actually want a Walmart drone sent to me in exchange for the DJI drone.. They just gave me canned responses, stating policy. That I should accept a return on it because there is no proof of what I shipped.

So infuriated about this. I've been on eBay since 1997. eBay was my first venture into the process running my own business. I was proud when I originally got my power seller certificate in the mail when I was probably still a teenager... Have 350+ feedback with no negative feedback ever. Apparently ""rank"" doesn't count in eBay-call-center-land. Now I'm just disheartened by the support I've encountered trying to reach out to eBay. 

From eBay I got into retail and now own a pretty successful company with multiple retail locations...so luckily this isn't going to kill me financially or anything like it would have when I was a teenager selling on there--it's just a huge let down and I want to warn others out there about this particular scam. 

If you're selling a high dollar item: please protect yourself from this type of thing... Take a video of yourself packaging the item or handing it to UPS..I don't really know the best prevention. I'm pretty careful and I'm getting really screwed over, sometimes it's just bad luck I think.

The buyer has 70 positive feedback (with at least one seller claiming this buyer claimed to receive an empty box, wish I'd have seen that) 

If anybody has any success in dealing with this situation, or an eBay (or you happen to be a law enforcement official in San Jose, CA where the buyer lives and signed for the package:) that can actually help me out please let me know!

Ebay,Beware of a clever eBay Extortion Method by Buyers,"So I found out the hard way that if eBay closes a case against a buyer that was opened up beyond the 30-day money back guarantee, the buyer can retaliate against you by leaving negative feedback.  eBay wont remove it because it's considered the buyer's opinion.

My buyer lives in Ukraine (a country that is full of scammers, unfortunately). Less than 1% of my entire transactions over the course of a year result in a problem with the sale (probably closer to 0.5%) and of those, about 66% of them are buyers from Ukraine trying to scam me out of obtaining a partial refund or forcing a return even though they know the risks of using a freight forwarder.  My buyer literally did the same exact claim against another seller on the same day and I mentioned this to eBay but they wont help.

I called multiple times and even asked for a supervisor.  They don't budge.

Anyways just a warning for you guys.",10,10,2018-03-16,EBAY,0.14206929504871368,0.8246172070503235,0.03331347927451134

Ebay,Seller sent item in unoriginal package,"I bought a Lifeproof iPhone case as a gift and received it yesterday afternoon. Upon opening the package, the case along with accessories were just thrown into a envelope type slip. I have checked over the listing multiple times and nowhere did it claim to come without proper packaging, I can't exactly gift someone a case with accessories just scattered in a little package.
I had suspicion that the case was a fake after this, but I contacted the seller and they tried to assure me they're a genuine reseller. 

Even if the case is genuine, am I protected by some form of buyer protection since the product was packaged poorly and is unusable for the intended purpose? 

EDIT: The item is listed as ""Brand New"" on the item page, and ""Brand New"" states the item should come in its original packaging.

Ebay,"Experienced ebayers of r/ebay, I have a few general questions about how you stay organized, how you live your life, and a couple other $$$ related questions that I would love to glean your knowledge/wisdom on...","I just started selling stuff a couple months ago, and the lure of both finding things to flip and just decluttering my house and making money off of it has already sunk its hooks into me deep!  In other words, I'm really into ebaying, I have a few questions I would love to hear from you on:

1. Do you have any system in place to stay organized?  Both in terms of your inventory/products and shipping materials and also in regards to all of the ideas of things you want to put up on ebay (things you see or think of and want to remember for later)?


2. How do you prevent your ebay side hustle from bleeding into other aspects of your life?  I am finding myself wanting to print off labels and pack things at all different times all throughout the day and even drive to the post office multiple times a day to drop things off and 'complete' the transaction.  Do you set parameters to just package and go to post office once a day at night or at lunch or something like this?


3. How/where can I learn what the most effective method of selling certain items are (like if something should go to auction or fixed price, and how many days auction)?  I can sense there is a science behind this that could help maximize sales and profits, but right now I am just guessing and taking shots in the dark.  I know the knowledge of this takes effort to obtain, where and how can I obtain it?

Ebay,"Buyer requesting return, where do I stand in this situation.","Hello, newer eBay seller primarily selling jerseys and sports apparel, 80% of my inventory is used and purchased via thrift stores and craigslist. I am fairly knowledgeable in jerseys outside of soccer, so I try my best not to advertise anything as authentic or official as with the soccer jerseys I honestly don’t know sometimes.

I had a person purchase 2 jerseys as high bidder on auctions which both had a lot of action. Before the auctions ended the buyer had messaged me asking if they were authentic which I replied that I couldn’t guarantee as they are bought secondhand and I’m not super knowledgeable about soccer. He said okay and proceeded to keep bidding.

Now he is requesting a return on both saying condition not as described/doesn’t believe they are authentic. First of all I’m pretty confident that these ones are legitimate anyways just based on my experience with counterfeits for basketball and baseball.

The item sold almost immediately, I shipped it off, a few days passed, and the buyer said he couldn't get the item to work (I tested the item and it worked perfectly on my computer.) After trying to help him out I decided to accept the return, sent him a return label, asked him to ship the item inside a different bubble mailer or a box (I sent this to him in a priority padded flat rate envelope.)

The item was seemingly lost so I went to the post office to ask about it, they were confused because they couldn't find it either. I come home and find the item was delivered... with a second shipping label, because the buyer reused the flat rate mailer I sent the item in. So he paid $3.40 extra postage out of his own pocket.

I inspected the item and while it's physically *fine*, it now stinks of cheap, crappy tobacco. So I can't relist it until I air it out, which might take a couple of weeks...

So, I would like to ask your advice on how to handle these problems.

1. Should I repay the $3.50 back to the buyer, even though I told him to *not* ship the item in the mailer I sent it in?
2. Is there anything I can do about the item being damaged by that horrible smell? Maybe dock his refund somehow?
3. Can the guy leave me a neg after the return has been processed, or is leaving feedback disabled like when you cancel a sale?

Thanks. :(",19,12,2018-03-20,EBAY,0.0831805095076561,0.8799163103103638,0.03690318763256073
Ebay,"Question: Seller lists 2 items but describes one. I am expecting two, but what should I do if I only receive one?","Disclaimer: I am trying to follow the rules and do my best for the posting guidelines in this subreddit. Please help me if I have stepped out of line.

Basically, I ordered an item that is listed as 2 games but is described as one. I can see how I am at fault if I receive the one because I jumped to buy the items seeing as it was a good deal, but upon further inspection he really only describes one thing in the picture, although the item is listed for 2 games. I am wondering if there is anything I could/should do about this. 

I am really not trying to paint the seller as a bad seller but I would like to receive what is listed. If there is nothing I can do, I accept the fault. Just wondering.

Things I could have done better:
- Talk to the seller before buying
- Reading into the item better

Ebay,Unable to get a refund from a returning item.,"In December when i bought the item (priced around 25 euros) from China, i received it the first week of January 2018...but never claimed it, because i've changed my mind and i returned it asap without opening it.

Things went complicated after i discussed with the seller, that they prefer to receive the item back first and then give me the full refund.

I was constantly checking it where it was, with the same tracking number i had from them, and the item arrived back in China after one month in 2nd of February. And in 4th of February was at the customs.

Since then it hasn't updated and it says that the item is still at the customs processing in China!

This is what eBay's latest answer was:

""We reviewed the details on your case, and found that the item was returned to the seller, but the return tracking information you've provided appears to be invalid. I can see that this is the original tracking number which shows unclaimed package- returned to original sender.
Please understand that in order for us to confirm that the seller received the item, it must be sent with a tracking information that clearly shows that the item was delivered, the date of delivery, and the seller's address where it was delivered.
Because the tracking number doesn't show delivery, we are unable to approve your appeal.
We know that this is not the response you expected from us, but we are confident that you will understand why we cannot hold your seller accountable for an item that needs to be returned without proof.
I trust I was able to explain why we are not able to approve and appeal if the item has not been delivered. We appreciate your time and understanding on this matter. Thanks for choosing eBay.""


I know it's obvious that Ebay want to see the tracking information, that the item was delivered back to the seller...but is this tracking info true? Maybe the item has been delivered and this hasn't been updated yet and the seller scammed me? Or is it really still at the customs for 44 days now as i'm writing this?

Also 25 euros is not big deal, but i want to know where the item is and if i've been scammed.

Ebay,Please help! eBay seller is trying to scam me!!,"Long story short:

I won a bid on shoes for $27.00 plus $15.00 shipping. The buy it now price was $75.00 plus $90.00 shipping.

I wait until the 4th day to message the seller inquiring about shipping. They say it will be delivered the following day and they will update me “if” tracking.

I wait until the 6th day to respond. I ask if it was shipped out and ask why they would say “if tracked” if shipping USPS Priority Mail (they always come with shipping).

The seller responds that there was a snow storm that hit their area. I say no worries, I still want the shoes shipped. The seller REFUNDS my money without me requesting it saying sorry for the inconvenience.

I immediately pay for the item again. I message the seller saying I’d  like to buy the item and there IS NO inconvenience.

They then message me back and say “oops the shoes are actually a different size than the ones I’ve posted” and says she will contact eBay. I tell the person I still want the shoes despite the error.

What can I do?? This is really irritating as I really like the shoes but more so that I’ve never been scammed before!

Ebay,"Please let eBay know what you really think about their ""NEW AND IMPROVED"" Feedback Forum...","I know it's not just me. The newly designed ""Feedback Forum"" that allows buyers and sellers to leave feedback for each other is severely flawed. I would like to discuss and get feedback from others to hear some suggestions on how to improve.

I tried to link a video on Youtube for reference but it was taken down by the bot. A picture speaks a thousand words, and in this case, a video speaks a thousand pictures. I made it to more accurately convey the problems I am experiencing, if you want to watch you can search for ""Ebay - Lets talk about your ""New and Improved"" Feedback Forum...

For reference, I have used both Google Chrome [no extensions] and Firefox and have a lousy experience on both. I am on PC, so maybe mobile is better but A) I doubt it, and B) I refuse to login to mobile to complete this process.

The new way of leaving feedback seems to be designed for my grandma who purchases one item a month

If I sell 50 items a week, which I can often do, like most people I wait until the weekend or I have some spare time to submit feedback. Now, the process and design of this particular area of ebay is very frustrating and time consuming.

I have to do each transaction one at a time, and every time I submit a transaction it minimizes it, then shifts the screen up, then shifts it back down to the next one. It will continue this process for every single transaction, so that it just compounds the time needed. The only way to alleviate that is to close the old feedback 'window' that you just submitted, but even that takes time as it has to shift all the old ones back up again.

I mean, yea it looks good, but function wise? I'd rather get a root canal.

What I urge everyone to do is go to the feedback forum: https://www.ebay.com/fdbk/leave_feedback?

The select the ""Comment"" button on the side and please tell them what you think about it.

This is my $0.02 All auctions should be listed in a spreadsheet style format, where I can see at least 25 on one page. I should be able to select Positive or Negative for each one, then I can copy paste my feedback into each. Then I can hit ONE BUTTON that says SUBMIT and it processes them all at once.

Ebay,"PLEASE HELP Fishy buyer requesting a return, I don't have money for it","Ok so by march 22nd (one hour from now for me) Ebay is forcing me to provide a refund, here is what happened.

So a couple weeks back I sold a Supreme hoodie on ebay for 550 bucks (ik im part of the fashionreps reddit, but this one is real, I bought it on drop to resell)

I knew the guy was fishy from the start cuz he has tons of fake reputation, is selling a fake lv wallet on his ebay (ik its fake cuz it says listed for $70 for 24 months) and now is up for a grand, plus its just a bad fake. 

But I said f it, and shipped it with signature conformination just to be careful. He doesnt sign initially and its sits at post office for like a week, finally he picks it up and signs off **WITH A FAKE NAME** The day after he quite literally signs of on it, he sends me a message claiming that he never got it. I simply responded by saying that he signed for it, it shut him up for a bit. My money was taken of pending, and I sent it to my mom. (I felt like i was taking alot of money from my parents over couple months, and did the right thing by giving it back) SO MY PAYPAL WAS AT 0 DOLLARS. And in total irl i have like 60 bucks cash. 

Two days after that Im sitting in class and I get a notification saying buyers wants a refund. His reason was that the hoodie is fake (its not) He is super duper fishy and is selling fakes, plus he had it for almost a week. 1) Even if i had money to refund him (which I don't I turned 17 today and am literally broke, it would take me weeks, months to make 500 USD) I wouldn't trust that he would return it in one piece, hell he may just pull a switch and send a dif hoodie. But point is I don't even have that option BECAUSE I HAVE NO MONEY. 

He tried scamming me, opened a false claim, and I can't even accept it cuz I don't have money. The claim was opened on March 19th, so I thought I would have more time to figure this out. I don't even have the opportunity, wtf do I do. I am 17 and can't afford to lose 500 bucks.",14,5,2018-03-22,EBAY,0.048536453396081924,0.9112001657485962,0.0402633473277092

Thank you for the reply, the bus is already at our Department of Logistics at Hill Air Force Base, Utah ready to go. The title and all the paperwork will come along with the bus. The shipping will be free for you because I will transport it using the internal transport system we have here at the Department of Logistics! The DoL will deliver the bus to the nearest Air Force Base from your area and from there I will use a flatbed to have it delivered at your door. The whole shipping process will take 4-6 days. I chose this method because, like I said, I was transferred to Elmendorf AFB in Anchorage Alaska and I'm not able to handle this deal in person. The financial part will be managed by eBay; you will have a 5 day inspection period before committing to buy the bus. In this way, both you and I are 100% covered during the steps of this transaction. If the bus is not as I described it, you can ask eBay a full refund without being charged. I would really like to get at least $ 5,400 so if you are interested in making this purchase in a timely manner email me your: full name, shipping address and phone number so I can inform eBay that I have a buyer! I will forward your details to them and then you will receive the invoice and also you will be able to talk with them directly and ask all you want to know about the payment. Please let me know if you're still interested in the bus so we can work out the details. 

Have a great evening!

In his return request, he has attached a photo of an Italian language Robot which is contained in a card sleeve that doesn't match the sleeves that I send out for every single one of my items.

Ebay,"Ebay ""below standard"" how seller performance ratings were changed without prior warning","Ebay used to evaulate seller performance with  ""To meet our minimum standard, you can only have up to 5% of transactions with one or more defects over the most recent evaluation period"" it was changed from 5% to 2% so many ebay sellers with good seller performance ratings were quickly dropped to below standard which raised ebay commission on their sold items from 10% to 14%  AND paypal holds all funds paid by the buyers into the account for 3 weeks or less if the buyer confirms the transaction was completed through tracking and positive feedback. Example is the seller sells an item for $170 and ebay collects $17 in commission and pay pal collects $5.40 in commission, the funds are immediately available in paypal and the buyer uses those funds to ship the item at $18.75 using UPS. NOW by dropping the defect rating from 5% to 2% the same item now pays ebay $23.80 in commission, paypal is the same at $5.40 and the $170 that the buyer paid to the seller with paypal is held in the sellers account and can not be moved for 3 weeks or until proof that the transaction between buyer and seller was completed. This is a scam - ebay purposely lowered the defect seller performance ratings from 5% to 2% to collect more commissions and paypal holds the funds so that the buyer in this case can not ship the item because they do need that $170 to pay the $18.75 to ship the item.

Ebay,How to prevent this type of scam buyer?,"I've recently been hit with 2 buyers who purchased items of mine only to contact me the day they receive them claiming something isn't working on it. I give them the general ""Return item for full refund"" reply.

But both items I've received back have clear signs of being tampered with and opened up. 

Upon more research I've been able to confirm that both of the buyers purchase items like mine and resell them as ""seller refurbished"" for triple to quadruple the money. One does it on his own website and the other on Ebay.

My best guess Is that they are swapping out working parts from mine for a bad one of their own. As the units I'm selling are not longer produced.",6,3,2018-03-23,EBAY,0.03368081897497177,0.8897216320037842,0.07659748941659927

Ebay,False INAD resolution,"Wanted to post a quick update to my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/840wen/angry_message_from_buyer_claiming_i_lied_about/

I've seen a lot of discussion lately in the eBay seller community about how eBay now handles requests to close cases/appeals and wanted to share my experience. I'm sure a lot of you already know this but it's news to me. After making my last post and being told that eBay no longer closes INAD cases over the phone, I waited until the 3 day period had ended (the buyer chose to escalate the case before I had a chance to) and called eBay. The rep I spoke to told me that they were going to allow the buyer to return, and that once I received the return in the mail, I was welcome to call again and file an appeal. A few hours after speaking to the rep, the buyer was refunded out of my PayPal account and I received a message saying the case was closed in the buyers' favor. I received the item a few days later, literally packaged in half a sheet of craft paper &amp; held together with a complete mess of what appeared to be crime scene tape (???). Amazingly the item was still intact. I called eBay and was transferred to the appeals department, where they reviewed my case and agreed to refund me. I had the full amount for the transaction sent to my PayPal account, out of eBay's own pocket by the looks of it, and received a message stating that the case had been reversed in my favor (I'm guessing my buyer did not receive a copy of this message). 

I can't complain- I have the money, was able to relist my item and had a generally pleasant experience with customer service, but I can see how this new policy of forcing a return (which, according to another seller I follow on social media, was put in place sometime in January?) no matter what is frustrating- there's nothing preventing buyers from doing this over and over, essentially ""borrowing"" an item knowing that they will be fully refunded in the end. 
Again, I'm grateful for how things turned out, just wanted to give a heads up to anyone unaware of this policy change.

TL;DR: eBay won't close INAD cases for you over the phone anymore. Unless you are able to resolve things yourself, buyer is automatically sent a return label &amp; refunded after 3 days and the case is closed in their favor. You can't appeal until you have the item in hand. If the case is reversed, eBay will refund you themselves &amp; reverse the case in your favor.",4,3,2018-03-23,EBAY,0.0534047968685627,0.9160040020942688,0.030591154471039772
Ebay,"Buyer wants to return a movie boxset because it ""doesn't appear to be authentic"" -- except it is.","So I sell Asian movies on eBay. Legit stuff, no bootlegs. This stuff comes from real distributors. I buy, watch, and sell it later.

I sold a boxset last month (which even came with a few goodies, surely if it was a bootleg it wouldn't have some pamphlets and stuff?) and today got a return request saying it doesn't appear to be authentic and that it looks a little blurry.

How do I go about proving it's authentic? I did send them a few links on http://www.blu-ray.com/ to the movie boxset I sold to them as well as a discussion thread around it and mentioned that the exact same product can be purchased from some reputable Asian movie outlets online that doesn't sell bootlegs.

In regards to them saying it's a little blurry, I don't know. It's a newer scan I think done by the company that put it out on Blu Ray in Asia. Older films can't be picture perfect.

I also don't accept returns, however I'm sure eBay would be much more likely to side with the buyer if they go crying inauthentic whether or not it's really the case.

Ebay,"Resolve Unauthorized Payment, to Ship or not to Ship","Hello, 

We run an eBay store that has recently been the subject of numerous Unauthorized Payment chargebacks through Paypal. Once a chargeback has been initiated, it completely screws everything up. The order can no longer be canceled through eBay because a Paypal case has been opened. When we have cancelled the orders through Paypal in the past,  we would refund the money and the case would be resolved at a later point in time. But this still seems to leave the seller on the hook for the eBay fees and hurts our Performance Metrics, as eBay still does not allow us to cancel the order. Is eBay trying to tell us something?

We use a forwarding/fulfillment company to ship much of our inventory. It has become a huge hassle to contact the forwarding company to cancel the order, not to mention the work required to resolve the eBay issues.

Although canceling the order is the ""right"" thing to do, it is becoming unfeasible. The costs of attending to the cancelation is greater than the cost of shipping the item and losing Paypal's Seller Protection. The easy thing to do would be to ship the item despite the chargeback and hope Paypal will reimburse the sale. So far we have been reimbursed for our chargebacks. But this situation is certainly not without other draw backs (perhaps attracts more unauthorized chargebacks).

Please let me know your thoughts or any recommendations. Thank you",7,3,2018-03-23,EBAY,0.18971018493175507,0.7863495349884033,0.023940248414874077

Ebay,Account hacked by a Russian to buy lube and laptops. I’m not kidding.,"As hilarious and unbelievable as this sounds, this has just happened. I am more serious at the end, I would like to take some kind of action against what has happened ideally, even though it is probably unlikely.

I recently got a new phone and hadn’t signed into eBay on it so I haven’t been into my account for a month or so up until about an hour ago. 

I get an email from PayPal at 5am, I happen to be awake at the time thankfully, sending me my receipt for an eBay purchase of £20.65. My brain went into panic mode instantly and I realised that I’m not even signed into eBay on my phone. I open the email and it appears a Russian man has used my eBay account and my bank card to buy anal lube... Yep. 

I get into my eBay account as usual, my password had not been changed thankfully. I changed my password and updated all my security details. After I logged in I saw I had two items in my basket, two laptops adding up at over £400. So I assume if I logged into my account any later than I did, I would’ve had £400 of laptops bought using my card.
In the recently viewed tab there was multiple brands of anal lube, the laptops that were in my basket, Nike Huaraches and Hugo boss shorts. 

[Some screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/DEPVS)

My account is back in my hands now, I cancelled the lube purchase and messaged the buyer with an apology telling them I was hacked. 
If anyone has had a similar experience I would like to know if there is any action I can take? I mean he used my bank card through my PayPal to make purchases.

He used the name for monitor B - one character short of A - in part of the description, and, in fine print under several pages of CE certification, included ""not sure if monitor is A or B. No returns if not as expected."" The specs for B are a subset of A, so the information could've described either equally well.

I've never been an eBay expert and they change how everything works so often it's impossible for a casual user to keep up, but an example search I make might look like this: (I'm a physical/novelty anime collector so don't lulz)

""death note"" dvd (figure, figurine, limited, collector, collectors, collector's)

Which returns a dozen results, which is what I was expecting since these items are long OOP.

Saved search transforms it into:

Ebay,Help - Having difficulty determining the legitimacy of a buyer; he has sent instant payment but I am very skeptical.,"After having a very poor call with eBay who completely misunderstood my situation, I was wondering if I could have some help determining whether or not this buyer is legit or not. 

About 5-ish days ago, I had listed an item with both an auction starting price and a buy it now price. Within two hours of having it listed, a buyer had bought the item for the buy it now price and sent me an invoice asking for my PayPal email and the amount I owed him, as well as an address in Chicago. 

I emailed him the same day telling him he would have to wait as I needed to determining final shipping costs and that I would get back to him on the weekend once I had done so.

Fast forward to yesterday, and I receive an email from eBay saying:
""eBay listings removed - unauthorized user of buyer or bidder account""

My first thought was okay, the buyer was illegitimate, I'll just relist the item later at some point. Then I receive an email from the buyer again, saying:
""I just received an email from eBay saying something is wrong with my eBay account, I knew where the problem came from. I had log on my eBay account into another device that was why eBay thought my account was access by a third party and they relisted the item due to their over zealousness. They decided to protect us both. The issues with my account have now been resolved and confirmed by eBay."" The buyer who emailed me also provided a completely different address in Nigeria. 

I then proceeded to receive emails from eBay that 1) came through my spam folder and 2) did not come through my eBay account messages. The messages said that:
""Dear Seller,

Thank you for listing the following items on eBay. This is to inform you that we have restored the eBay listing involving you and [Buyer]. which was removed back on the eBay database. We have investigated the issue and we have found out the original buyer and owner of the account purchase the item before a third party had access to the buyers eBay user account.

We sent you an email regarding the purchase and the buyers eBay user account. These issues have now been resolved and you are required to continue with the transaction. You must remove the item listing or stop the sale of the item to any other buyer if you have re-listed the item before receiving this message.""

The buyer also said that he had sent me an instant payment through PayPal for the item, and that had also come through my spam folder. The payment has been placed on hold until I ship out the item and include the shipping address. The payment included the buy it now price for the item and an added amount for the shipping and handling cost (which I have not yet even determined).

I am super skeptical (and also very new to eBay) and am very concerned what I need to do. I feel as if these emails are fake/illegitimate and I am going to get scammed. 

I hope this is not confusing, please let me know or DM me if I need to give anymore details. The buyer is very persistent that I send the item, and I have told him to wait on multiple occasions because I need to determine the shipping.

Ebay,Had my cologne removed because of a Trademark Violation,"So, I'd been selling cologne and perfume on eBay for about 3-4 months now. I've been collecting fragrances for almost 15 years. Over that time, I've probably sold 30 fragrances, and have received 100% feedback. Most of these have been from my own personal collection, as I wanted to trim down my fragrance collection. I also bought a few fragrances from a perfume shop in my area. I found that vintage fragrances that aren't made anymore fetch a much higher price on eBay. 

Fast forward to now, and I received a trademark violation on one of my colognes. I sold the exact same cologne almost a month ago, and the customer left positive feedback. The official reason was ""Trademark Violation - Unauthorized Item"". I talked with them on the phone, and they said I need to provide more pictures, better description, and a ""certificate of authenticity."" I told them that I don't know what planet they're from, but colognes are not sports memorabilia, and do not come with ""certificates of authenticity"". They also said that they want me to list the receipt for the item on my listing. So I'm going to list the receipt, so I can show my customers exactly how much money I'm making off of them. In addition, it's an informal, written receipt.

After adding to the description, adding even more pictures, etc., it was taken down again. What really stings is that the same cologne is on eBay in about 60-70 listings. These other listings are no different from mine. When I bring this up, and ask why they're singling me out, they can't seem to speak coherently. Part of me thinks that I was reported by a competitor because I had the lowest price.

What cannot be emphasized enough is that I sold the EXACT SAME cologne a month ago, and the customer is happy. Unfortunately, you can't have a reasonable conversation with customer service - they are trained to follow eBay rules, no matter what - basically robots, to be honest.

Ebay,"Need Advice: Faulty Device, Friendly, Seller.","Hello,

I bought a graphing calculator. The seller has a perfect rating, looks like he/she mostly sells for personal reasons (not a store).

The shipment was as prompt as can be; unfortunately the calculator arrived with a row of dead pixels.

I reached out to the seller, certainly not blaming him/her outright because I don't know when it might've happened. Also, to the seller's credit, the dead pixels don't even show unless you're doing specific things; it looks like they tested the basic functions. Anyway, the gist of my message was to find out if they had a proof of purchase, so I could repair it under warranty.

Unfortunately, the seller didn't have proof of purchase, but he/she offered to replace the calculator if I sent the faulty one back. They were selling school edition graphing calculators, so it seems like they have a couple on hand.

Anyway, I feel bad, because that would be about $80 in lost opportunity or damage for them, presuming this is an honest scenario.

Is it foolish not to take them up on this offer? Are they protected in some way I'm not aware of? Is there some kind of eBay action that can clear my conscience?

Ebay,Seller will not refund item and is lying about item condition,"Hi,

I recently purchased a used GTX 1070 on eBay from a seller with good history. It arrived with a bent backplate. This was shown, though not super clearly, on the original listing. As the item was described as fully functional I decided to run the GPU anyway to see if it would work despite this dent issue. It worked fine, so I never brought it up.

About a week later the GPU died and I notified the seller and he said to return the item to him for testing and we'd go from there. Once it returned to him he informed me that the reason the card has malfunctioned as because of this dent, and claimed that I was the one to do it and closed the case with the reason: *I received the item in a different condition.*

Now, one of his evidence photographs is basically the same as his listing photograph, I've linked them below.

Following a conversation over emails he's refusing to refund as I claimed the item was working originally, and did not ever mention the dented back plate. It was my mistake to not photograph this defect when it arrived, but as it worked with it I gave it no thought (something I will never do again). 

Would I likely have any success talking to eBay on the phone or over emails about this?

Ebay,"Buyer purchasing Pokémon packs, weighing them and filing for return on packs that weigh low","So I sold a pack of Pokémon cards I've had for a long time. Not sure if anyone is familiar but it's a shadowless pack. I didn't learn about weighing them until I was going to sell it seeing as how they were selling for a pretty penny. 

Well I had a buyer buy it once, not pay then after the non paid claim and relisting he bought it again and paid right away. I should have blocked the buyer but that's a different subject. Called eBay told them I was concerned about his buyer filing a claim etc. 

Anyways, surprise surprise the buyer filed for a return 8 minutes after it was delivered. Said ""changed my mind"" I denied the return because this guy has at least a dozen negative feedback as a seller for not sending items when they sell too low, or sending partial items. I wanted to protect myself. 

Anyways he sends me a message ""just to let you know I'll be leaving a negative feedback for not accepting my reasonable return"".  I told him I'd rather take the negative feedback than lose $300 if he sends me an empty box. He left me a negative feedback saying ""by far the rudest person I've ever encountered on eBay. Hope u don't have a problem"". Now eBay won't remove the negative feedback since he technically didn't threaten a negative feedback. He used the correct words and antagonized me with the negative feedback. Anyways I left him a feedback saying ""beware, takes advantage of sellers""

I woke up to a message from a random seller who saw my feedback for this guy. He asked me what happened with me and said he was concerned the guy was trying to scam him, so I told him.  He then told me he sold this guy 5 packs of Pokémon cards, the guy filed a return for two saying his wife is sick and they need the money. We came to the conclusion this guy is buying unweighed packs, weighing them and then filing for a return for the ones that weighed low (meaning they won't contain a rare holographic). 

I've reported the buyer and suggested he other seller does as well. What can I do here besides what I've done? People like this guy ruin eBay and he is still somehow able to buy and sell.

Ebay,I sold a network locked phone. Buyer shipped it overseas via a forwarder and now wants a partial refund because it's not unlocked. What are my chances winning a dispute?,"The carrier, t-mobile isn't willing to unlock it. It was originally a prepaid phone so I think the FCC rules requiring an unlock are different. Nonetheless, I never stated it was unlocked.

I didn't offer any shipping outside the US, but the buyer used a forwarding service to ship it overseas and now wants a partial refund to cover the costs of unlocking. The buyer opened a request for a return, but in that request have said they will not or can not ship it back to me due to being in another country. The buyer hasn't said directly they used a forwarding service, but they have said they're in another country and googling their address shows a forwarder that operates between the US and the buyer's country.

Considering that the 'fault' was in the original listing (in ebay's specifications for the device, it said Network Status: locked), I never said it was unlocked or unlockable and the buyer has said they won't return the phone to me, is there any chance if a dispute is raised to eBay they will side with the buyer and make me refund without a return? Is the 'network status: locked' in the specifications and the fact I never described it as unlocked enough notice for ebay?

Ebay,"Seller sent the item to the wrong address, confirmed by Fedex, eBay only looking at online tracking","Hey guys, bit of a story here but I would really appreciate if I could get some advise on an issue I'm having with a seller.

I bought an item a few weeks ago and it never arrived. During this time I sent the seller several messages and they never answered. I opened a INR case, but eBay decided against me and did not refund the money. The seller is still radio silent, and a call to eBay revealed the seller had contacted eBay via phone and provided a tracking number because ""his computer was having trouble"". (this is illogical, to see the dispute in the first place the seller had to have a working computer).

 

I called Fedex and to ask about the tracking number, and they have confirmed the package was not sent to the address listed on my eBay account. However, they cannot give me the address it was sent to because this violates someone else’s privacy (makes sense).

 

How can I convince eBay the package wasn't sent to me? I have an online chat with a Fedex representative confirming this, the chat was sent to me via email and I gave it to eBay.  I have contacted Fedex via email to get another written form of confirmation and will send it to eBay once received.

 

eBay's current stance is ""the tracking number says it was delivered to the city you live in, so it should be at your address"". How is this fair? There is no specific address associated with online Fedex tracking, and over 100,000 people live in my city. How is just the city name enough to prove delivery? Especially when Fedex representatives have confirmed it was not sent to my address?

 

Any help or guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Ebay,Why does Global Shipping Program stops shipment of vacuum tube stereos from US to Canada?,"Hey folks,

In the last year, I've purchased eight vintage and new vacuum tube stereo amplifiers and pre-amplifiers and some extra tubes from the US through GSP. From those, the Pitney Bowes staff at GSP decided to: improperly repack two amplifiers resulting in damage (eBay refunded the full price after a month), claim that two other stereos were prohibited (eBay refunded the full price automatically), and claim that vacuum tubes are prohibited for import to Canada on one out of five different purchases of vacuum tubes while doing nothing to stop the other four. eBay couldn't tell me or the seller about why that one set of vacuum tubes were held at GSP for around a month before being stopped and ultimately refunded.

Most recently, I purchased two examples of an amplifier from a 1960s console from different sellers; GSP stopped and refunded one, but not the other. I've successfully ordered and received tube amplifiers and tubes from non-eBay sellers around the world, and never once did Canada's customs stop any of them after inspecting and re-packing with their customs tape.

I've asked eBay what specific law, regulation, or policy prevents importing or exporting such items, but their CSR won't specify or refer to the Pitney Bowes team. The sellers couldn't get that information, either.

How do we get GSP to consistently allow vacuum tube gear shipments, or to consistently stop those shipments (and make that an explicit rule known to sellers and buyers before transacting) so that GSP complies with whatever law or regulation prevents export of vacuum tube gear to Canada?",7,3,2018-03-28,EBAY,0.11220492422580719,0.8622416257858276,0.025553446263074875
Ebay,What am I entitled to in this situation?,"Hi Redditors,

I recently order a pair or Persol eyeglasses on eBay that were meant to come with an “authentic case”. Instead they came in a shifty, half broken, ugly no-brand case. 

I complained and they said they were shipping me a new case. It got lost so I complained again and they asked if I’d be happy with a $15 refund for the missing case. These cases usually retail for $30+

What am I entitled to in this situation? Am I able to receive a larger refund? Do they HAVE to provide me with the authentic case? Any other options? They’ve be a pain in the ass to deal with so I want to throw the book at them.

Ebay,"Seller said item I purchased was broken, then relisted the item","Hi everyone. A few days ago I purchased a vinyl record through a $5.99 Buy It Now. The next day I got this message from the seller:

Hey I apologize for the inconvenience but while I was preparing to ship I notice that the record was broken in half I’m pretty sure one of my roommates has done it and not told me. I have other records . I’ll get the list ready and maybe you can se did you like a me ofnthem and we can set up a deal for you

I told him no problem, these things happen and let's just do a refund. I checked later that night to see if he had responded, and he hadn't, but what he did do was relist the exact same item, except it was a $5.99 starting bid instead of a $5.99 Buy It Now. I know this because I got an alert that the item had been relisted. When I go to my order details, it says ""Cancellation for this order is pending"". My question is this: should I report this person, or just let it lie as long as he refunds? It was a lower value item that I probably didn't need anyways (maybe $15). I'm not into wrecking anyone's reputation, but it ticks me off that he would lie and then just straight up relist the item one day later.

Ebay,Item not as described AGAIN!,"I think I'm cursed. 

I spent a decent whack of money on Item Q. Item Q was listed specifically as ""Item SKU Q-1,"" as only available from *one* retailer including a *really important* accessory you can't buy any other way - *and obviously present in the photo used for the listing.*

The photo is a stock photo. (It's hard to tell with photography equipment - the seller often shoots this sort of thing as their profession.) The item does not include the accessory. It is, for my purposes, totally friggin' worthless. I can't even buy the part.

Ebay,"First time seller, what are some common scams?","Hello eBay perusers and users! I’m a first-time seller, selling an extremely gently used 13” 2017 MacBook Pro for a fixed price rather than auction. I have just removed my listing due to errors in the specs listed that I somehow overlooked. Prior to doing that this morning, however, I had woken up to 4 messages from prospective buyers, all asking for more info. I got a message from eBay telling me one of the senders had a compromised account, and another message from a very similar username shortly after, so I ignored those messages. A couple of others wanted to exchange texts rather than on eBay, which I found strange. One individual offered well over the retail price for what this laptop would have cost new, even after I amended the specs, and was insistent on me sending him my email so he could make the payment on PayPal. Two of the offers claimed to be “urgently trying to find a gift for their kid.” All of the accounts I got messages from were created within the last couple of days. All of this had the air of scams so I didn’t give out any more of my information.

Do you have any recommendations for first-time sellers? I only have one PayPal account, it’s linked to the email address that I use essentially for everything. Is its security somehow easily compromised by giving away the email linked to it? I previously thought that was the only way to be located on PayPal. Should I make a separate email and account just for eBay? Should I reject all offers not made directly through the “buy now”option? What scams should I be on the lookout for? Thanks in advance.

Ebay,"Buyer Claims Fraud on His Account, Seller (me) Loses Out?","TLDR: After selling my first item in a while, eBay removed the listing AFTER I'd shipped the item saying that the original eBay account holder had fraud committed against them, yet I as the seller am the one who is losing out on $$$.   

Basically, I've sold a few items over the years on eBay and have never had any issues.  I recently started selling again and was excited that my iPod had sold within 30 minutes of listing it.  A day later (today), I ran out to the post office about half hour before they close (it's Saturday so they close pretty early) and shipped the item. I go to eBay to put in the tracking info and notice something strange.  It looks like over $100 is missing from my ""over the last 60 days"" sales.  Basically, I had sold 2 items, one for not too much money and the iPod, which was a little over $100.  I investigated further only to see that eBay had removed the listing entirely because the owner of the account had reported that an unauthorized person used their account to purchase the product.  I somehow managed to get to the post office minutes before they closed and the worker told me he couldn't do anything.  

I called eBay only to learn that I'm on my own as a seller.  They gave me a bunch of resources of how I can basically deal with it on my own, none of which were at all helpful: USPS's customer service phone number (a joke, called and listened to hold music for 30 minutes, for a 1 hour and 4 minute possible wait) and a url to report internet fraud.  That's it.  In the end, I went to USPS's website to intercept the package, which ended up costing me $21.75.  So, basically, I'm out the money I've already paid for shipping, plus that amount to intercept the package, and almost lost all the money on the iPod itself.  I'm not sure if there was a better option, but I'd rather pay that than be out the iPod cost too, and potentially having a criminal know my name and home address that would have been on the package.  

After speaking to the eBay rep, I am still confused as to what even happened.  The address that I sent the iPod to is the same one of the eBay account holder's, which was listed on PayPal (confirmed by eBay rep).  When I proposed the idea that the buyer changed his/her mind last minute and scammed me, the eBay rep assured me that they do a complete investigation into the eBay holder's account, including checking IP addresses, etc.  I'm just not sure how a scammer wins by having something sent to the actual eBay holder's address rather than their own.  I'm also not sure how to avoid this in the future.  I've perused r/eBaySucks and r/Flippers and it looks like as sellers we have very little protection, while buyers can game the system all they like, yet there are so many people who seem to be selling on eBay and making a living from it.  What am I missing here?  Any reason not to just ditch eBay and use Amazon instead?  I'm new at this, so forgive my naivety and possibly stupid questions.  Also, if you've made it this far, thank you for taking time to read this and ""listen"" to me rant.  Any advice or input is welcomed.
