Ebay,100% working fraud way to bypass customer protection and steal buyers money,"It's simple:

1. Sell a potato as an iPhone 5.
2. Name any non-existent address for returning shipment (or just ignore it).

The case will be closed because the buyer is not able to return your precious potato.

Sounds stupid? Nah, it's working. Here is an example: http://imgur.com/a/RPzKf

1. I've ordered a brand new item, got used and broken.
2. I've send it back, but seller didn't came after it in for 2 months, so it's sent back to me.
3. Case is closed. Customer support reviewed and also closed this case.

It's the second post about the same case: http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/21ulxa/customer_protection_my_ass/. 

I'm posting this in separate cause the eBay finally closed this case and customer support told me that ""everything is 100% correct"": if I'm not able to return the item - I can't receive a refund. That's it.",14.0,7,2014-05-01,EBAY,0.08455415815114975,0.8726145029067993,0.04283139109611511
Ebay,"Won auction, paid immediately, seller canceled transaction cause ""he didn't make enough""","Hi guys,

I won an auction yesterday, paid the item immediately through PayPal. A few minutes later, I get a message from the seller indicating that he wants to cancel the transaction. When I asked why, he stated he was selling the item for his friend, but the friend was unhappy with the winning bid and ""thought he would make more money.""

So when he sent the request to cancel the transaction, I clicked ""decline"" thinking that that would prompt him to issue me a refund. I message him back, asking him if he was going to ship the item or give me a refund. He responded ""refund.""

Now, he is claiming that because I ""declined"" it is up to me to ""accept"" the cancelation of the transaction so that I can get my refund. I don't see an option for this on the ebay website.

I contacted ebay customer support and they told me the following:

- he can still issue the refund, even though I pressed ""decline"" (I messaged him this and he has not replied)

-they can't force him to ship item, so I have to wait for him to issue the refund or ship the item. If he doesn't ship, I can open a ""didn't receive item"" claim and ebay will take it from there.

My question is: what should I do if he's ignoring all my messages now? At this point, I just want my money back but he's claiming he doesn't have an option for this.

What is the best thing for me to do now? I don't want to let too much time pass by

Thanks

EDIT: I messaged him asking when I would get my refund and he replied:

""You denied the cancellation I already submitted the refund it might take a while. You will receive an email""

How long does it typically take to get the refund?

Ebay,Getting a Refund of Shipping Costs Through Global Shipping Program,"Not pleased in general with the GSP.  I received a damaged item and the seller was more that willing to refund me the purchase price, but asked I go through ebay to get a refund of the shipping costs as they had used GSP.  How do you do that?  I couldn't find an answer on ebay's website, there was an obscure thread on the ebay foums though that suggested success if I went through PayPal.  So off I went..

Holy crap, what a gong show.

The shipping fees go directly to a company called Pitney Bowes through PayPal, while the purchase price goes directly to the seller.  The only way to get shipping costs back is to go through PayPal.  You have to start the process to file a complaint so a reference number and a phone number can be generated and you can call them about a certain payment.  Once you call however, they transfer you back to Ebay customer support, who then internally escalates the claim to a ""customer support claims specialist"" who reviews the case to see if it is worthy to escalate further to ""their logistics expert.""  

One may never speak to this ""logistic expert"" (I asked), as they can only be reached via an internal email system by the ""customer support claims specialist.""  I am told that I will be emailed by the ""logistics expert"" within 72 hours of my phone call, informing me of their decision.  This faceless person will review my case and decide whether I get the shipping costs back without contest, or whether further investigation is required.  

As this is my first claim, I have been advised that no further investigation will be required.  I asked about future claims, as this might seriously affect my decision on whether or not to buy the item (as in avoiding it like the plague), and they said that a more thorough communication with me and the seller would occur and that supplemental pictures may be required.

Of note, the ""logistics expert"" has no way of being reached directly from outside of Ebay.  The only way they communicate is via internal email that is activated by a ""customer support claims specialist"" (read: I spent a lot of time on hold today).  In other words, if this ever happens again, I will have to follow these exact steps, go through three people to escalate my case to the appropriate internal, faceless, and anonymous level that is only accessed via the most inefficient customer support process possibly ever created by mankind.  

If contested, I anticipate I will probably be notified of a time and location in a back alley where I will finally meet this ""logistics expert"" and we will fight to the death a la Kirk and Spock in Amok Time, complete with batons and accompanying music.",4.0,3,2014-05-01,EBAY,0.04728058725595474,0.9275346994400024,0.025184720754623413

Ebay,Item sold as broken/no returns accepted. Buyer claiming extra faults and thus wants refund. Where do I stand?,"I sold an iphone 3GS with a broken home button on Ebay UK for £30. I listed it under ""for parts or not working"" with a policy of ""no returns accepted"". The buyer has emailed today saying it's not charging and there's no sound.

These issues were definitely not present when the item left me yesterday.

So where do I stand? My assumption would be an item listed as broken with a stated policy of no returns means I'm not obliged to give him a refund for the item.

Again, He still hasn't replied. It has been 7 days after the purchase of the monitor, I am a new person to ebay and I am a bit worried he is trying to delay the buyer until I cant make a dispute. So I sent him another message asking politely if he could get back to me and tell me why it is taking him so long to reply. I didn't threaten him with a case because I do not want to falsly acuse him of anything. Can I get some feedback from anyone who has experienced this and knows what to do.

Ebay,"First time having problems with seller, advice?","Hello, I have bought lots of used items off of ebay but have never run into a problematic seller, could anyone advise what to do in this situation?

This took place on UK ebay. I won a single auction for two shirts and had previously contacted the seller through ebay messenger to ask if the shirts had any stains or defects, and the seller said no. When I received the shirts, one of them had a very large and obvious stain on it (the shirts were not pictured up close in the listing).

Unfortunately I did not check the sellers 6+ month feedback and they had two neutrals for selling stained clothing.

At first the seller denied it was stained, but after I sent some pictures showing it, they said they would refund my money if I returned them. I said I would need a paypal payment for my shipping to them. The seller agreed but then stalled for a couple of days. When I contacted them to send me payment so I could ship, the seller instead issued a partial refund (about 40%) of the original listing and says ""I will refund everything including your shipping when I get the shirts back"". They keep playing dumb and waiting 24-36 hours between emails and I think they are just trying to get out of paying my return shipping.

Today when I checked my paypal there was nothing posted to my account from the seller. When I check recent transactions it shows the partial refund but says ""Pending until 12th May"" - I have never seen this before.

Ebay,"eBay Global Shipping Program Scam? Why Russia, Why?","http://imgur.com/a/cHRK8


I sold a Canon T2i and unwittingly sold it to a buyer in Russia although I'm nearly 100 percent sure that it said the buyer was located in the states. Does the GSP mask buyer's real location?? Once I made the sale and got paid via PayPal buyer left a comment to ship to a Russian address. I did not. I shipped the item to the address that eBay/Paypal provided (An address in Kentucky). It turns out that it's the shipping hub for their Global Shipping Program.


Anyway, buyer received package and immediately filed a claim stating that I sent a different camera. Damn it. He's doing a switch-a-roo. He posted pictures in the claim. Everything that I included and the packaging was there except for the camera. 


I've dealt with eBay for the past ten years or so. The seller never wins. How am I supposed to prove that I sent a T2i and not what the seller is presenting. I'm pretty sure I'm out a camera.

Okay, but I did add a photo. I didn't have the photo uploader that's usually there but I did supply a link to a photo.

I **did** select PayPal but entering my PayPal email address. There doesn't seem to be any other way for me to select PayPal as my payment method, and I don't want to receive payment any other way.

Ebay,Am I going to win this or no,"So I was selling an Arctic Ops Varus Skin code for league of legends and my description went like this:

PLEASE NOTE: CODE EXPIRES ON MAY 3RD AT 11:59PM PST

CODE HAS ONLY BEEN USED ON NA

This is a con exclusive obtained at C2E2 2014 and my LAST Varus code! It will unlock the Arctic Ops Varus skin on any server and is redeemable once per every server. If you have NOT gotten Varus already, it will also unlock him!

They were only available at PAX East and at C2E2 this year. PAX East codes have already expired, but C2E2 codes are still usable until May 3rd at 11:59PM PST.

Code will be delivered through private eBay message ASAP after the auction and comes with a GUARANTEE that it will reach you before May 3rd at 11:59 PST. 


Please note: you will not be mailed the physical card itself. This is digital delivery only
Unavailable in NA and EUW
WILL ACCEPT MOST DEALS OFFERED HURRY WHILE IT LASTS


So the guy buys it for $5.50 (Gave me an offer and obviously I had to say yes). He pays the money and I send the code. 10 minutes later he messages me saying that the code doesn't work. Obviously I assume hes in the other regions trying to use the codes (Because it doesn't work in the NA or EUW as my description states). Apparently he tried using it in the NA, I specifically stated that it doesn't work in the NA and that I don't give refunds. Now he's reporting me for scam and fraud on paypal and ebay along with trying to get a refund (Even though I finally gave in and offered one after like 20 messages of him raging on me).

However the bangle i received was not sterling (it was only 87% silver, not 92.5% sterling) and it turns out it is only silver plated, and not solid silver.

I get the impression that English is far from the sellers first language which has made things a little complicated, however they after a few messages through the ebay case system they have agreed to give me a refund.

Here we come to the problem i'm having, the message i recieved saying they would refund me the money was ""You close the case , I 'll give you a refund , please believe me "".
That sounds very suspicious to me, and since i don't know ebay that well, i'm not sure what i should do or how refunds actually work!

I told them I would rather they canceled the item because the notification warned the unpaid items would go against my record/ebay account.

The seller did not respond so i wrote them again and they told me they would look into it, then did not respond again. 

Today I received the notifications that the cases had closed and the unpaid items have been recorded onto my account. So far it appears I appealed them and they will be removed (??? at least i hope i did).

If a person just writes ""Hold for pickup"" in the Address 2 field, will that work? Can it be written in marker on the package, or is there a special sticker? 

I'm having trouble finding any more info online, do any of you guys have experience with this service? Maybe I'll stop by my PO when I get a chance if nobody knows.",3.0,5,2014-05-08,EBAY,0.2693841755390167,0.7074044346809387,0.02321142703294754

""""Can I just get like a partial refund or something because I hate the hassle of shipping and I would have to pay for shipping it back.""""

another says: ""Buyer would not communicate. Kept opening claim against me. Should've message me""
-
Another says: ""Buyer opened a claim for sending first class and not priority""



________________


Normally I like to make all buyers happy, avoid negative feedback, and offer full refunds. I would hate to purchase a game, and have it not be working. I know some of the old Nintendo systems have issues like if the contact pins are not clean, it makes it hard to read some of the Video Games. He might legitimately be having issues with the game, and I don't think it would be fair that he would be out $20 without a working game to show for it.


BUT... he doesn't want to send the game back for a working replacement, or a refund. he says he hates the hassle. yeah shipping is a hassle, but I sort of feel like he is just trying to con me and get his item cheaper. I Mean out of 40 transactions, he just so happened to have 3 open cases that are visible on his feedback? god knows how many he actually opened that people didn't comment.


Right now I'm thinking of just emailing him letting him know I can only do a refund upon him returning the product. and after he returns it, I'll send him a working copy and reimburse the shipping he paid to send it to me. but it'll most likely piss him off, and leave me with negative feedback. but at the same time, I figured  it's a way to take a stand for ebay sellers, to stop this guy from trying to hustle discounts from sellers.

Ebay,eBay: Better for Buyers,"I had one claim for Item not as described, customer offered no proof changed thier story up 3 different times, yet ebay still chose to refund them.

I have yet to get my returned items. While this case was being 
decided by ebay, I sold 2 large pieces of printing equipment.
The day the heat press arrived, customer claimed it had been damaged and sent me photo of what it looked like he did with a crowbar. Now he wants a return, doesnt want to pay the $65 to ship it back.

Also, the recipient of the vinyl plotter I sold wont respond to messages, or leave feedback. I'm willing to bet he is working out a way to manipulate eBay's policy into a freebie for himself. It is my opinion that if you are going to sell on ebay, you will need to sell cheaper items (less than $100) and have a profit margin of 40-50% to cover the fees, packing, shipping, chargebacks, buyer cases, etc that cause a transaction not to pan out for the seller.


The fact remains that Ebay is a publicly traded company, and is under pressure from its investors to turn a profit. They have clearly narrowed thier formula down to a buyer drivin company vs a seller drivin compay. If you have buyers, the sellers will come to sell (if even just to sell once).


The buyers know they have the power, they know the policies and are well aware that there is no way that anyone could ever prove that what was shipped was the item they purchased or the condition it was recieved. Ebay &amp; thier sellers rely on moral authority to keep things on the up and up, leaving customers to police the sellers. I wish best buy had the same policies, I'd have one a movie theater in my house.


If the buyers buy, then the sellers have to pay that 10% final listing fee, the $.30 paypal transaction + 3% transaction fee. Buyers pay nothing, but are the reason ebay sellers pay to use service.
Finacially, it seems like the perfect decesion.... but I wouldn't open a store and put an honor box in place of a cash register and I wont be selling on ebay.

Long story short

Dude from Uzbekistan buys my power supply (I forgot to turn off certain countries), but I have a note on my account to contact for out of U.S. shipping.

He wins auction, no email, asks me immediately when I'm shipping after the auction is over and wants confirmation tracking.

I look at account and say, you are in Uzbekistan and never contacted me about shipping so I will have to cancel the auction. Sorry.

He threatens me saying ""Be Careful,"" you better ship it or else. And my Paypal address is in California so you ship there not Uzbekistan.

I told him I already refunded the money and that he should update his profile because as a seller I have little to no protection as is, and sending something to California when the account is in Uzbekistan is really not safe for me.

He starts CAPITALIZING letters and yelling at me because I'm not sending it yet... I tell him to stop bothering me, he has his money back, and to change his Ebay address to avoid any confusing with future sellers.

He leaves me negative feedback saying I am a ""tricky"" seller and to watch out! Yes, the last thing I want to have on my seller profile is a negative feedback from someone saying I'm tricky and to watch out.

Problem is I can't leave him feedback! For some reason he can leave me feedback, but I can't leave him any. So I open up a user complaint against him through the sold item and I'm just waiting for something to happen.

Ebay,"Sold an Item, now buyer is crying wolf.","Hey guys,

my friend sold a purse on ebay for quite of sum of money, it was a high end.

payment goes in, the buyer receives the item and then everything went to hell. The buyer is complaining that the bag is torn and looked way more used than what was on the description. Personally being unbiased to my friend I checked it and it was literally a 9/10 had it not I would have told her to not even bother selling it anyways. This buyer opened up a case, my friend is trying to do almost anything see can buy offering partial refund and the buyer isn't taking.

Now as of today the buyer is questioning as to whether the bag is authentic or not, which it is but I kind of feel the buyer is trying to pull a fast one on my friend. My friend pretty much has all the original receipts to back up the authentic aspect.

could any one of you guys help as to what she can do? This buyer is pretty shady IMO.",11.0,2,2014-05-12,EBAY,0.033981163054704666,0.9203101992607117,0.045708682388067245

Ebay,My first month of selling on eBay,"I tend to buy a lot of gadgets that I don't end up using.  So, I decided to sell a few items on eBay.  Of the six items that I listed, I had to relist (and open cases, wait for my final value fee credit) on three of the items.  And on some of the relistings, I had to stay on top of the auction in the closing hours to delete fake bids.


1) Computer A - Sold. Received payment.

2) Smartwatch - Sold. Received payment.

3) Smartphone A - Sold, buyer contacted me saying that he couldn't afford the phone.  Never received funds.

4) Smartphone B - Sold. Received payment

5) Smartphone A (relisting of #3) - Sold.  Received payment.

6) Computer B - Fake bidder (competition).  Never received funds.

7) Computer B (relisting of #6) - Sold, deleted many fake bids. Received payment.

8) Smartphone C - Sold, received payment quickly.  Received message from PayPal that transaction was fraudulent.

9) Smartphone C (relisting of #8) - Sold, deleted some fake bids. Received payment.


With #4 and #5, I found that competitors were setting up fake eBay accounts to push the price of my item up so that bidders would bid on their item instead.  

I've found that it is best to delete any bids from customers with 0 feedback.  If a bidder's email address has the word ebay in it, that tends to be a red flag.  With the case of the fraudulent transaction - the shipping address associated with the PayPal account was different than the shipping address associated with the eBay account.  I had never checked this before.  Luckily, I received a message from PayPal before I had a chance to send the item.  (It was actually packed and in my car - and I received the email on my phone.)

Ebay charges your account a 'Final Value Fee' the moment your item sells (not when you receive the funds).  This is 10% of the purchase price including shipping.  You then have to wait a few days before you can open a case.  The case stays open for several days - and then you can request to close the case and get a Final Value Fee credit.  It is a bit of a pain.",1.0,1,2014-05-12,EBAY,0.07791262865066528,0.8949213624000549,0.027166029438376427

It orders parcels by postcode instead of anything useful, it's impossible to easily combine parcels and there's a weird bug with auto-marking as dispatched which causes 'ghost' orders to reappear for weeks at a time. It's maddening. 

I've written an [ebay to myhermes CSV importer script](https://github.com/jukibom/ebay2hermes) if only to stop myself from going insane. You can enter all the weights at the command line (in order) and combine parcels to produce a nice sanitised myhermes CSV file to upload.

Ebay,How do I advise eBay that a buyer is using an incomplete address yet is still able to purchase and pay for items? Explanation inside.,"I just sold a book two nights ago, buyer paid for it, everything seemed fine. I went to print the shipping label but the address was incomplete--it had their street NUMBER, city, state and zip, but no street name (making it impossible to ship anything to them, since there could be 100 different ""18 xxxxxxx"" addresses in that city). 



I contacted them via eBay but after not getting a reply by that evening, I was able to find their e-mail address via paypal's record of the transaction. I know it's unorthodox but I e-mailed them directly, since I wanted them to get their book on time and I didn't want to have a bad mark for shipping something late. Thankfully I woke up to an e-mail back this morning with the full address.



I'd like to think they'll make sure to change it so that the address is complete for future sellers to be able to ship to them. But, I don't know for sure that they'll do it. I'm amazed that eBay even let an incomplete address get through the system, to the point where it was my responsibility to change it on the shipment page. They shouldn't even be allowed to place the order without a street name!!



Anyway, my question is, is there some way I can contact someone at eBay to bring this to their attention?

Ebay,"Scammed by a buyer, eBay rules in their favour. How is this fair?","I sold a graphics card on eBay at the end of last month. As you can see in the listing, I clearly marked it as faulty/spares or repairs, because I hadn't tested it. I bought it in the same condition from another eBayer, but found another card in the interim and so didn't even put it in my machine. Had never bought or sold anything marked as faulty before.

Suffice to say, I made a nice profit. I was pretty happy. Then...

The seller opens a case against me. Without contacting me (which is protocol), claiming to not have received the item. Okay, fair enough, I thought. It was a bank holiday here in the UK, and so I asked politely if he'd hang on until the following week, as usually bank holiday weekends are a postal shitstorm. I offered a postage refund as a gesture of good will.

He wouldn't accept it. Was adamant I hadn't sent it, because he'd 'bought something off someone else the same day and that had arrived'. Conclusive proof... /s

The emails went on. I referenced Royal Mails postal times and when they class something as lost, remained polite constantly, continued to offer postage cost refunds. The buyer gets more and more illiterate in his emails, threatens bad feedback if he doesn't get the refund. It's starts to smell a little fishy...

Before I go on - I fucked up. I didn't send the parcel tracked, so couldn't prove anything initially. This bites me in the ass later on. If you have a potentially high risk item like something faulty, ALWAYS track it. That was my bad.

Anyway, I'm starting to get the feeling that he's received my item. And that he's tested it. And that for whatever reason, it doesn't work, and because I said no refunds, he's abusing the system to get one from me.

And so, my gut says to check Gumtree, a popular second hand listings website, similar to Craigslist. And find [my item](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1GYHeH74AlsJ:www.gumtree.com/p/for-sale/asus-nvidia-geforce-gt-640-2-gb-directcu-silent-graphics-card/1059449255+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk), listed the day after it was due to arrive. In the same location as the seller. With exactly the same title as my listing.

Now, I know what you're thinking. Loads of people live in that area. Anyone could have the same card and happen to be selling it, right?

So I confront the buyer with the link. 5 minutes after I sent him the email, the listing has changed to [it's current form.](http://www.gumtree.com/p/for-sale/asus-nvidia-geforce-gt-640-2-gb-directcu-silent-graphics-card/1059449255) Edited but also taken down.

This confirms my theories - the buyer has received the item, isn't happy, has tried to sell it on. Rather stupidly, I feel, but there you go.

So, the case elevates, I add photos of the gumtree listing, and think that there's no way that the case will go in his favour.

But it does. And eBay totally ignore my arguments in relation to the Gumtree posting. Because I hadn't tracked it, they wouldn't help me, basically. Lesson learned on that one.

I realise that they might see it as tenuous and non-conclusive evidence. But I would hope that my long standing history with the service and excellent feedback score would count against his which pales in comparison.

I appeal, and they rejected that too. Now, I have no item and I am out of pocket.

I reiterated that they were visually graded, said that I'd said that on the listing and said what my visual grading was for him again (lots of scuffs, some slightly heavier marks), and he says he still wants a partial refund or a discount on a future buy.

We will use only eBay to close the transaction.The car is in eBay custody at their shipping company sealed with all the papers(title signed by me, ownership, insurance papers etc) in Omaha Nebraska. The shipping is free because i supposed to ship the car to another buyer, then he told me that he doesn't have money to pay for it. He already paid the shipping charges.The payment will be handled by eBay and they will keep the money on hold until the end of the testing period.This way we can both be protected and insured.You will receive the car in 48 hours depending of your location and you will have the chance to inspect it for 5 days.During the inspection period you can test the car or go with it at your local mechanic for inspection .The car will be delivered directly to your requested address as soon as eBay will have the payment confirmation from you. In case you won't be satisfied, you can cancel the transaction and ship the car back on my expense.
Email me your full name and full shipping address with the phone # so I can notify eBay that you are selected as my buyer and they will contact you.""

Ebay,Shipping Question Small Flat Rate Box,"So I started selling with eBay at the beginning of April.  One of the more confusing things for me at first was trying to figure out how to charge for shipping.  I gravitated towards using flat rate boxes whenever I could because of the ease.

I've purchased perhaps a dozen shipping labels through eBay paying for a Small Flat Rate box and affixing it to a USPS Priority Mail Box 4 (7 X 7 X 6).  

I actually thought I saw the words Flate Rate Box on these boxes when I first started,  but now I do not see those words anymore.

I shipped two items today using this method, both saving me and the buyer shpping cost.  And they've always been accepted even with a flat rate shipping label.

I noticed that all of these listings I followed (8+) from a particular seller ended at a price around 14.5usd (+- a few cents). The winning bid was always placed a few seconds before the listing ended (as usual) by a different buyer. On all these listings I placed bids ranging from 11-13usd.

So.. here's my question: do these large Ebay stores bid on their own items when they see it won't reach a certain price?

Ebay,"Ebay seller here, advice on strange situation. Is this scam even possible or am I being paranoid? It just feels like something is off.","So I sold a rather expensive item on ebay about a month ago.

Thought nothing of it, but two weeks later I get an email from the buyer asking where the shipment is. It shows that it shipped, to an address in  New Jersey, but the buyers address is now listed as an overseas shipping facility in FL. 


My first assumption was that I (as a somewhat disorganized person to begin with) messed up somewhere along the line and put the wrong address on the box. I use a template microsoft word file that I just keep copy/pasting new addresses for each thing that I sell, so it seemed likely that maybe I slipped and accidentally used the last address I shipped to. 

However, this theory doesnt add up because I have no idea where I got this random address in NJ from. I've searched through all of my other ebay sales, my emails, my past revisions on the label template, my paypal account, etc for this name and address in NJ and I have no record of ever having shipped anything to this random house in NJ

""HELLO SELLER I WANT YOU TO EMAIL ME THE CONDITION OF THE ITEM, SEND ME YOUR PAYPAL EMAIL ACCOUNT, IF POSSIBLE THE PICTURE OF THE ITEM AND ALSO EBAY UPDATED MONEY REQUEST FOR PROPER CONFIRMATION, SEND THIS TO MY EMAIL xxxxx@xxxxxxx.com WITH THE ITEM NUMBER AS LISTED ON EBAY IN OTHER FOR ME TO MAKE QUICK PAYMENT. I WILL ONLY RESPOND TO SERIOUS SELLER, REGARDS""

Basically it concerns me how much info this guy is asking for. I have no idea what the norm is, so maybe I'm just being paranoid. It also concerns me that he wrote in all CAPS.

Does anyone with a little more expertise have any advice?",5.0,2,2014-05-18,EBAY,0.030532602220773697,0.9324007630348206,0.03706669062376022
Ebay,[REQUEST] Advice on Selling Sets of Collectible Plates...,"Got several sets of collectible plates that my mother purchased 10 or 15 years ago.  Set of six Picasso reprint plates, hand numbered, but no packaging or COAs.

3 of the 6 aren't on ebay anywhere.  One seller who has the three that are has them separately listed with BIN or fixed price.  The others have them listed singly as well.

My question how best to deploy this inventory?  Singly, as a set?  If singly, should I time them all at once so someone can see that the entire set is available?

What about pricing?  The fixed price for the three that are available is between 12.99 and 19.99.  Something is urging me to list them singly and put them all out at once at .99.  Then buyers bid them singly and people looking for the set can bid on all six.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",11.0,2,2014-05-18,EBAY,0.02760033868253231,0.920417845249176,0.051981788128614426
Ebay,[UPDATE] Goodbye eBay! I'm done dealing with you.,"[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/25kw1g/goodbye_ebay_im_done_dealing_with_you/)

After eBay Resolution Center ruled a full refund in favor of the buyer, I opened an investigation with Canada Post. Today, the buyer emailed me to inform that the package has arrived in Japan. He proposed to return the full refund if the item is in good condition. Later today, he confirms receiving the item and proposed to issue him a invoice through Paypal. I followed up with him and he payed shortly after. 

I'm glad that all went well in the end. We both tried our best to resolve the situation. I definitely have to find a proper carrier service that will no require almost 3 months to deliver. What is your recommendation? I am shipping medium boxes from Canada.

Ebay,When you notice a buyer leaves negative/neutral feedback often...,"Sold a turntable for parts. Noticed the buyer leaves a bunch of negative/neutral feedback for things like inaccurate description, slow shipping or poor packaging. 1 out of 4 of his given feedback is bad. I made sure to pack the heck out of it and was certain it would be fine. I just noticed he left me a neutral feedback because it was ""packed poorly"" :-(  it's my second neutral since 2006. Kinda bummed about it. I messaged him to try and figure out a solution but I'm doubtful that will get me anywhere.

Ebay,"Buyer 'pencils in' free shipping in buyer comment section of Best Offer, am I bound to it?","So I got a best offer on something the other day, had it listed for $21, they offered me $15 and I took it.  After sending the invoice, I received a a message from the buyer saying 'Thank you for accepting my offer of $15 + free shipping, please adjust your invoice so I can complete checkout.'  Um, I never offered free shipping on this item and was having trouble figuring out why she thought as such.  After some sleuthing, I discovered that she penciled in 'free shipping' in the buyer comments area.  

This is one thing I have never run into before.  Obviously, had I seen the 'includes free shipping', I would not have taken the best offer.  I accepted the offer through the app on my phone and the buyer comment is not exactly easy to see.

I messaged the woman directly, explained the situation and asked her to either pay the amount due (her BO price of $15 plus shipping) or I would be happy to cancel the transaction.  What she did instead was contact ebay and complain, resulting in a courtesy email from ebay.  The strange thing is that the text of the email states that I never responded to the woman, which I did.  She failed to respond to me or even discuss it, she ran right to eBay support.

Anyway, is this a thing?  People can just hand write any terms of purchase in the buyer comments and we are bound to them?  At this point, I am at a loss as to what to do.  My guess is that she would have opened a case, but since no transaction has officially taken place (no money or item changed hands), she was unable to and contacted Ebay CS instead. I could open an unpaid item case, however, I want none of that. I want her to just go away, cancel the transaction like it never happened and add her to my block list.

Any thoughts?

Thanks!

So what to do now, after spending hours trawling through ebay support, there is NO way to contact them or have them contact you. It’s as if they are going out of their way not only to be invisible but to frustrate the end-user as much as possible.

Been reading this sub a bit over the last couple of days, and this morning I joined Ebay and also purchased an Ebay store.

I have a couple of questions however.

I intend on offering Free shipping on many of my items, and also one business day handling/processing.   My question regards return policy...I imagine I should write something up that is pretty specific?  I hear that Ebay is pretty much if buyer feels buyer gets.  Is there any writing or ""Return Policy""  that would protect me a bit?  I don't mind refunding a return, but I do mind paying return shipping, and the work of re listing/reselling, packaging again, etc...something like a ""Restocking fee""  is that even enforceable?

Ebay,Being scammed by a buyer (w/ hard evidence) and ebay won't help.,"I sold a car stereo in fully functional condition. Sent it out and the buyer received it on the 16th. The same day, the buyer opened a case saying the stereo has a broken button and displays an error when playing CDs, and that he will upload pictures as proof. The buyer uploaded a picture of the stereo installed in a car with an error message **but it was very clearly not the same stereo.** I mean, wear that was on the stereo I sold was missing, and wear that my unit didn't have was present (the volume lettering was half worn off ect). Very obvious that the guy just took a picture of his broken stereo trying to pass it off as the one I sold him.

Instead of responding to the case I contacted ebay. The abridged 25 min conversations is: I explained the details and picture proof. The CSR says they can't do anything and that I should contact the buyer. I asked to speak to the resolution center. She informed me that it was the resolution center. I told her that I'd like to speak to someone who can deal with this issue directly (as I have in the past) since this was a clear case of someone trying to scam a seller. She told me that it has to be worked out in the online resolution center. After much (calm, non rude) back and fourth I ask to speak to the manager. After 10 mins of waiting she informed me that the manager was busy and would have to call me back later that day. That was two days ago.

I decided to write out the details of how the stereos didn't match and post that to the case in case the buyer escalated before I had a chance to deal with it further.

I've been on ebay since 1999, and have seen some pretty poor customer service and seller abuse, but this is a new low.

Ebay,Why eBay is failing. Feedback means nothing. International Buyers. Fees. Upaid Items.,"This is not a ""I hate eBay post"", this is why eBay as a marketplace is failing.

I have used eBay for over 8 years, in its beginning years it was amazing. Very little issues with sellers or buyers, feedback meant something and customer service was key. 

Fast Forward to the 2014. After hundreds of transactions, I have several mini stories to share which led to my reason for leaving what use to be my favorite place to shop. 

Lets get started with the basics. 

Feedback doesn't mean anything anymore. Whats the point of feedback when a buyer purposely buys an item(bidding on it multiple times over the course of days) then messages me when they win and say, ""I dont understand the description I dont want this anymore"" and only gets a slap on the wrist. eBays down fall is not allowing me to be 100% honest with the buyers, incase you didn't know, you cannot say in your description, DO NOT BUY IF...etc. 

International Buyers, the combination of language barrier, different thinking and exceptions destroys the marketplace. I have had great international buyers but I have had terrible ones. I have had countless international buyers deny paying for shipping costs because its too much or they want a smaller box with no packing to save money(They wanted a cell phone to be sent in an letter). I have had an international buyer ask me for shipping prices to his country 5 minutes before auction close(I didn't see message till later in the day and shipping price was listed), he denied to pay because he claimed it was too expensive. I have had a buyer tell me I must used a forged customs declaration, it was a nightmare working that out with eBay.

FEES. I had zero problems paying for additional little auction packs back in 2005. There is a multitude of fees from eBay and Paypal now. I love when I get a phone call from my bank telling me I am negative several hundred dollars because eBay decided they can pull money out of my account when it is not there.

Unpaid Item Cases. What ""genius"" decided it would be a smart idea that the seller must go back into a case to reclaim the buyer didn't pay. For example, sold an item, buyer said they dont want it. Open unpaid case, after 7 days or whatever I can claim my final value fee but if I dont I automatically will never see that final value fee again. After 7 days of no buyer response it should be automatically refunded. Buyers should be forced to pay for an auction if bided on 24 hours before auction close. I totally understand if you see something and bid on it within minutes with no time to read the description but if you have DAYS to read, its on you to not bid on something you don't want.

Once again I am not ""hating on eBay"", this is a rant regarding eBays biggest pitfalls.",21.0,1,2014-05-22,EBAY,0.07518846541643143,0.897898256778717,0.026913296431303024

Ebay,Should I leave negative feedback?,"So around the beginning of this month I paid for an item. About 2 to 3 weeks later I still haven't received it, not marked as dispatched or anything, so I open a case to ask the seller whether he's dispatched it or not. They then provide tracking information saying that it was delivered and that I had signed for it (no idea what happened, maybe the postman delivered multiple packages to me at the same time and left one in the van or something and I signed for it) and he also left a very angry message calling me a thief and whatnot.

Now I know for a fact that I never received the item. I've already contacted the Post Office and they couldn't find it telling me it was probably a Royal Mail error. But with the tracking information which has my signature on it I don't think I can do anything to try and get it back.

The seller has been very aggressive with their messages and are unlikely to help me and I'm considering leaving negative feedback which I have never done before. I don't think the fact that I never received the item is their fault and I'm not even too bothered about the money. But their general attitude when responding has left me very annoyed at the seller and at this situation. I'm also not sure whether to close the item not received case or not (maybe I should they've already posted tracking info)",8.0,4,2014-05-23,EBAY,0.16476747393608093,0.805921196937561,0.029311301186680794
Ebay,"Changing from old defunct email to current email so I can update my password... Ebay ID: xxx, Email: xxx@gmail.com, ""Your eBay user id cannot be the same as your email address."" Wtf?","I've been operating my eBay account for 8 years now, and as the title states, somewhere along the line I switched email addresses but didn't change it on eBay. The first one (which is tied to my eBay account) is now defunct, and since you need a correct email address to get the password reset form, I figured I'll just change the email address to my current one. My ebay username and my gmail username are the same (because everything's easier that way), but when I try to change my default email address in eBay to my matching-name gmail account, it says ""Your eBay user id cannot be the same as your email address.""

What? SERIOUSLY?? Why the hell not!? What purpose is that supposed to serve? So I essentially have to start a new gmail account just to autoforward the eBay password reset form and any other related eBay emails to myself at my regular email address. That seems pretty stupid.

Ebay,"Changing email address reregisters my ebay account, but doesn't change the email address? I think ebay.de is broken","I really hope that this is the right venue for this.

First, some background. I live in a country that doesn't have ebay. Seeing as I, by landmass, am geographically close to Germany, I chose to register there, thinking that all email communication would still be in English - Boy was I wrong! This sucks as I don't speak German which makes all purchases a pain in the ass. Even if I use ebay.com, all my emails are in German.

So what I'm trying to do now, is free up my email address from my current ebay account, close it (the ebay account) and reregister with my normal email address, so that I don't have to use a seperate email just for ebay.

The problem I'm having, is trying to change my primary email address on ebay.

The problem is as such: (This is on ebay.de)

I go to the  ""Personal information"" page.

Go to the e-mail tab and hit ""edit"", which prompts me to [relogin](http://puu.sh/90D8C.png).

Then I get to [this](http://puu.sh/90Df1.png) page, which is exactly what I want. For those that don't speak German, it is now asking for my new e-mail address.

Enter my new address, the capcha and hit ""Continue"".

Which brings me to [this](http://puu.sh/90Dmg.png) page. They now want to verify my identity? But I just wanted to change my email.

Oh well, select ""Verify identity with credit card"", which brings me to the credit card information site. Fill in the information and hit ""Continue""

Which ends up on [this](http://puu.sh/90DQ4.png) page. Wtf? My registry is almost complete? They've sent an activation link to my old e-mail address and if I click that, it says that my registration is complete. It doesn't make any sense! I just assume that the buttons somehow have been linked wrong! If I go to ebay.co.uk, it redirects me to ebay.de when I try to edit my account information.

I have spoken with two seperate ebay.co.uk representatives and neither of them could help me. The last one told me to contact ebay.de via chat and ask them if they can help me. After explaining to the representative that I didn't speak German, he told me that they're fully capable of English and that I should just ask them to speak english straight away. I thanked him for his help, went to ebay.de and lo and behold! They don't have a chat! Only a phone line, which renders it impossible for me to do anything!

Ebay,Is there any way to get a seller who is reneging on an auction to send the item?,"This is my latest communication to the seller: 

&gt;As you know, I paid for the guitar I won from you in an auction in April immediately after the auction. You refunded my money two days later and said you had done so because you were having problems with paypal. When you told me recently that your paypal problems were resolved, I paid you for the guitar a second time. When I inquired about a tracking number, you refunded my money again without explanation. I assume you are not going to send the guitar. The only way that I can make sense of your behavior is that you like to hold no-reserve auctions but then renege if you not like the price. Since I won the guitar in a no-reserve auction you are contractually obligated to send the guitar. I will naturally make a complaint to ebay about this and give you negative feedback unless you have some explanation and intend to send the guitar. If you intend to send the guitar please let me know so I can submit my payment a third time. Please do not contact me outside of ebay. 

and this is his reply: 

&gt;Hi The reason I sent the payment back to you again is this last time we talked I explained PayPal would not give me the money you sent, This was the first time I encountered not getting my money since I have been with ebay, aprox 10 years, I did everything I could to find out why, When you submitted the money again I called Paypal and Ebay, Ebay told me they checked my account and this time they would give me my Money immediatley, As of today I still had no access to getting my money from Paypal so I through PayPal I made them cancel it and send your money back... when you contact ebay tell them what I told you and maybe they can tell you why they told me they would give me the money and then change their mind... I don't know if this is a problem on your side or what... But until Paypal will give me my money I don't want to ever sell on ebay again... Good luck with Ebay As far as not wanting to give you the Guitar, I want you to have the guitar, But I must get my Money... When you contact ebay tell them to read this message because I want them to know they are LIERS and are going to lose a good customer who has bought and sold 1000s of dollars on ebay

Ebay,I think someone is trying to defraud me through eBay/Paypal. What do I do?,"Long story short, I sold a pair of pants for $50 a month ago and now the guy is hitting me with a chargeback for an ""unauthorized purchase"". Now my Paypal balance is negative. No contact was ever made with me by the buyer. He didn't attempt to return the item or even message me about it being a legitimate unauthorized purchase.

I even messaged him asking what the issue was after I went onto Paypal to dispute it and I still haven't gotten a reply.

I provided Paypal with everything I had to prove my side of the story...which was essentially just the tracking number for the package and my account of the events leading up to the chargeback. 

Do I have any chance of winning this? From the stories I've read online about eBay chargeback fraud, Paypal seems to be awful at contesting any fraudulent chargebacks with CC companies even though they claim to have ""seller protection"". Is there anything else I can even do to increase or guarantee that my money/items aren't completely stolen from me?",2.0,1,2014-05-25,EBAY,0.06159256398677826,0.9092098474502563,0.029197638854384422

Ebay,Minor ebay issue - do I have to cancel the transaction?,"This isn't an overly important topic. I could call ebay but I find them frustrating, so I thought I'd try to gain some info and advice here. I'm presuming that that is the main purpose of this sub-reddit (?). I'm hoping to get some input so I know how best to handle this situation for now, and for when a similar situation arises again. 

I had a buyer give me a Best Offer on a Buy It Now or Best Offer listing. The Best Offer was for $1 over the Buy It Now price. As such, I new something was up but accepted it in any case. I sent the invoice as per normal. I received an ebay message from the buyer the next day or so saying that the offer included postage (whereas my listing was for a base amount plus postage). 

I've had one very similar circumstance that was discussed on Reddit so I'm aware that the Best Offer system / procedure does not include any adjustment on postage costs - postage costs remain the same as stated in the item listing description - and on top of that the buyer had made no reference to them wanting the offer to include postage. 

I sent them a message basically stating the above. They didn't pay. An ebay non payment case automatically opened, and now they've sent me a message. 

The message is very polite (despite being potentially incorrect at stages) and the buyer apologizes and says excellent feedback will be left if I request / process a cancellation of the transaction. 

Now here's what I'm thinking...

I have 2 options.

1st option is to not get involved and let the non payment case run it's course. I don't see any negatives of doing this, other than it not being what the buyer wants - but then I don't see why I need to cater to buyers that buy then don't pay. I also like this option because the non paying buyer will get a non paying strike, and that's what should happen. This option involves no further effort on my part, which I like.

2nd option is to initiate the cancellation as per the request - which is a little bit of unnecessary work for me caused by an annoying buyer and will benefit the buyer in that it will allow them to avoid receiving a non payment strike, which I resent on multiple levels, and I think I'm right in saying that if the buyer doesn't accept the cancellation (and if we go through this process 10 times sooner or later someone won't accept the process, despite requesting it), then I will be subject to pay the ebay seller fees (?). I do not want to be subject to any fees simply due to annoying and selfish non paying buyers. Something that ebay should address, but of course won't. 

Also, if I do initiate a cancellation is there the potential for positive or negative feedback? It seems to me that the buyer is trying to seduce me with an offer of positive feedback, which makes me a little nervous.  

So I guess I'm asking what is the best course of action - to request or not to request a transaction cancellation, or just let the buyer lie in the bed that they made. 

Best in terms of the repercussions for the seller, and what's best to manage buyers within the ebay system.

Ebay,"Item I bought has been removed from eBay, and the seller has not replied to my message?","I bought something off of eBay some time last week. For some reason it said that I had committed to buying 2 of the same products. I don't recall adding more than one to my basket, but I contacted the buyer and said that there had been a problem, and that I was more than happy to pay for the first item, but not the second because I did not need it. They said that it was okay and did something (not sure what; I've never been in the position to remove a purchase or whatever) and I paid for the item that I wanted. 

2 days later I hadn't received a notification telling me that the item had been shipped. I'm used to people shipping the next day, if not the day after, depending on what time I bought the product. I messaged the buyer and asked when it would be shipped, but I have not heard anything back. I couldn't find the product that I was buying on this seller's eBay anymore. [This message has come up in my *purchase history*](http://i.imgur.com/70Przdw.jpg).

He hasn't left me any feedback, nor has he contacted me/replied to my message. I'm just a bit worried, because the item cost a fair amount, and I don't want to lose out on money. I purchased it through PayPal. 

The postman came by today, and there was nothing for me. Should I wait it out another day or so before contacting, or should I contact now?

I called the postal service and they said it was delivered and there was nothing else they could do for me and that I would have to contact the seller. I attempted contacting the seller.

I opened up a dispute hoping that might get the seller to respond to me. shortly after I opened up the dispute I got an email saying the seller has cut off all communications with me (not that there was any) and was escalating the dispute to a claim. so I guess my question is, seeing that the seller did ship the item, can i realistically expect to see either the item or my $150 back?",15.0,3,2014-05-27,EBAY,0.06435782462358475,0.9051843881607056,0.03045782819390297

Ebay,Fake feedback?,"I've noticed some power ebay sellers that have some suspicious feedback patterns.  For example, one seller has almost 1.5 million feedback score with 99.4% of that is positive feedback in the last 12 months.  Negative feedback for the last month alone is 208 and the last 12 months is 2,194 with many claiming that they never received the item.  

Looking closer, the positive feedback shows patterns of the same buyers making upwards of 50 purchases from this buyer alone in one day.  Some of the buyers have the same things to say as each other and most of them adore the seller and items they purchased.  They leave wonderful feedback that contradicts everything that the negative feedback expresses.   

We could come up with explanations about how some people buy multiple things from certain sellers for resale, gifts, personal use, etc.  The problem is that these patterns are clearly a part of this sellers tactics to inflate their feedback score.  I'd wager that most of the positive feedback, if not all, is fake and that all of the negative feedback is from real people who either did not receive the item they paid for or received the wrong item or an item that is used with holes and stains when advertised as new.

Ebay,How to deal with annoying buyer?,"So I sold a Mac which works perfectly fine and had it collected. Prior to collection the person asked for my number in case they got lost. Now I told them its not on the latest OS but what to do if they want to upgrade. Since then the person has now called me twice. Having problems being able to upgrade (I had it running on the latest OS so clearly they aren't doing something right) and bringing up another problem that it loads webpages slow. They said they was going to see if the Apple Store could help so hopefully I won't get another call. Also they mentioned the possibility of me going over to their city to sort it out or them come here. 

Its getting really annoying. I sold the computer and it works just like I said. I'm not offering 24 hour tech support and its hard work dealing with them. Said they couldn't get Chrome installed! It seems every problem the buyer runs into they will just call me and blame me for it. I feel its leading to an inevitable demand for a refund because they can't figure something out.

Any idea on how to deal with this situation? The buyer paid with PayPal and obviously knows where I live.",6.0,2,2014-05-29,EBAY,0.07470421493053436,0.8788408637046814,0.04645498842000961

It took me thirty minutes to pay, but I got him his money in full. I let him know that I had paid and apologized for not paying it instantly. This was an auction, mind you.
I also payed a 20.00$ rate for expidited. After asking for the tracking number several times he finally responded seven days after I paid him. He explained that he was on vacation, even though he said he would get it out that week. 
That was last Monday, and he said he'd get it out in a few hours. I again asked him for the tracking number and I have yet to receive it.

Ebay,[Update] Dealing with annoying buyer,"Thanks for the help yesterday it was helpful, I have been contacted again since then, but this time via eBay (Which is good, some proof now right?). 

Basically saying they still can't update and Apple can't do it either, they think an inner board may be faulty. Well, I had it on the latest OS and all I did was a system restore, so highly doubt the board was faulty during my time with it. Anyway, they said Apple is looking into and it has been left there until next week. I know having no return policy on my listing doesn't mean much, but aren't they no longer eligible for a return by leaving it with Apple? If they can fix it for cheap they will pay as they want to keep, and if major 'sort something out' or return as faulty.

I'm confident I can update it myself for them, but hearing Apple couldn't even do it, not so much now. Plus, I don't want the hassle. Especially don't want it returned, it functioned perfectly fine on the latest OS. Now I would have a 'faulty' Mac on my hands. It wasn't faulty before it left.

Ebay,Buyer will not respond to anything...,"So, I sold a pair of shoes to a user, wasn't sure about authenticity. *After* he gets the highest bid and pays for the shoes and they have been sent out, he determines the shoes were apparently replica. No problem, I'm not gonna screw the guy over, so I tell him just send the shoes back when he gets them. 

He received them on May 10th, and I have not heard from him since I sent the shoes out. It's a bit ridiculous that I have not even got a tracking number yet. I told him he had a week (about a week and a day ago) to get me a tracking number or I could no longer supply him a refund, because for all I know he could be wearing the shoes around and destroying them just to send them back and eventually get his money back.

So, what can I do? He will not respond to any messages. My policy is no returns, so am I really required to even give him a refund in the first place or was I going above my responsibilities as a seller? The listing never claimed them to be authentic. 

I just would like to know if I can use the money because it really appears I will not get the shoes back, but there isn't any way to know for sure. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
