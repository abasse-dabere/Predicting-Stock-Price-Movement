Ebay,"Am I victim to an attempted scam? This is a strange one, would like some experienced insight. Chat transcript with seller.","So I purchased a MacBook Pro last Thursday from a member with a 51 score. I actually did not win it, the winning big went up to $2200 and my max was about $1750. I got a 2nd chance offer and went ahead with the purchase. A few hours later I got an email from eBay saying that the item was removed and no longer available, so I sent the seller a message.

***So I just got a message that says: The listing you're interested in is no longer available. What's up? Are you going to send the item? This concerns me since I already sent payment. Thanks***


He responds: 


***Dude check my feedback rating, this is why you got the message!!!! (the person that won the initial auction is a fraud and his account is no longer there so they ebay cancelled the actual item. Compare yourself, don't be so quick to open cases like that, take it easy) I am not sure what that means, got your My ebay and you'll see the item you paid for. And yes I plan to ship the notebook right after work.***


He then says a follow up message

***Now paypal reversed the transaction, you are a bad ebayer. Seriously?***


PayPal did not reverse the transaction. My response: 

***You're kidding me right? I sent the payment to you and am waiting for you to send the laptop. What the? I did nothing at all. I'm just trying to buy a retina macbook. Accusing me of being a bad ebayer? Right. I pay for everything on time. They probably think you're a scammer since you removed the item from eBay. Listen, if you are legit then I have no idea what's going on.*** 


He says: 

***Understood, your macbook will be on its way today or early morning tomorrow and I will update the tracking number, thank you! Apologies for overreacting but I thought it was the case when its not. Feel free to send me a message if you have any other questions. Thanks***


Me: 


***Just message me the tracking number once it gets sent, since I cannot access the listing anymore from eBay to grab it. Thanks***

Ebay,Is this buyer trying to scam me?,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I had a porcelain figurine listed at $130 as best offer for a while. I got a message from someone with no feedback asking if they could do a local pickup (they were in NJ and I'm in CA), but I said I would make sure it arrived safely. They asked if it was damaged, and then how low of a price I would take ($115). The next day, I got an offer from them of $100. I countered with $115 and reminded them of our discussion. They accepted it, I packed it up carefully, bought insurance and sent it out. A few days later, I got several poorly written messages complaining about how the piece was broken. I told them to send me pictures. They said they didn't know how to take pictures and that their friend would do it the next day. The pictures came in the next day (along with a message asking for their money back), and sure enough there were a few pieces broken. I asked for pictures of the box, and then said I'd file a claim in a few days and they could send it back to me. They sent more pictures, and the box looked undamaged. They then said they would just keep the figurine for a discounted price. This all sounds like a scam to me, but I'd like a second opinion before I lodge a complain.

Ebay,Scammed with a Fake Galaxy S4 via eBay- Pictures &amp; Details Inside (x-post r/Android),"Just got scammed with a fake Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 via eBay. A bit below market value, similar to /u/fuckeduphere and his story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidUsers/comments/1h39aq/bought_a_very_good_fake_galaxy_s4_heart_broken/). The listing looked legit, the person had close to a hundred positive ratings, and there were no classic warning signs that I had noticed. It came in an open but branded box, branded plastic on the screen, and plastic over all the other glass, with two extra branded batteries, charger/usb cable, and branded earbuds.  

I've never had a genuine S4, so the experience is relative, but the build is pretty solid - the things that tipped me off were all via the software -the lack of GPS, no ""Smart"" features (Air Scrolling, etc.), and a 4.2.2 version with a build named ""GINGERBREAD.zskj6"".

The [Genuine Samsung app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hotdog.truth&amp;hl=en) was an extra confirmation tool.

Ebay,Just a tidbit on how Ebay likes to treat people who aren't giant Chinese junk sellers....,"So I get a scammer and a liar leaving me negatives.... nothing I can do about it.  In total that gives me 4 out of 170+ sales with low ""as described"" ratings.  2 I know are bullshit, the others I have no idea.

So this month I decide to start fresh and do a more business oriented account.  I started a new seller account (MANY people have multiple accounts) and start selling under it...  totally accepting the restrictions.  It is with all my info and linked to my Paypal, no tricks or hiding.

I run into the category listing limit of TWO items.  I call customer service.  In the course of that call I am told I am not good enough to sell on EBay, that I don't pay enough in fees, that I don't ""try hard enough"" since I got some low ratings and on top of all that the rep flaunts it that HE can see who left the low DSR ratings and I can't.

So I demand a manager....  all I wanted was increased limits based on my 8+ YEARS of selling on my other account, the last 2 spent as a TRS.

What do I get?  Some 20 year-old snot telling me that not only will he not raise the limits but he is going to suspend all selling on my new account until the low DSR's clear off my old account.  So fuck them, nothing I can do.

So I go back to selling on my now crippled old account that has no limits.  Now, today, I get an email from Ebay saying that because my new account I just registered (remember, it is now suspended from selling because of THEIR actions) is suspended that they are going to limit my linked account (the old one) and only allow me to sell a few items a month and it can only be reviewed after 90 days.

That is how Ebay treats people that pay them hundreds in fees every month, has been selling for years and has simply ran into a few bad buyers.

What amazing service they provide.  I paid them more last year than I paid for my CAR PAYMENTS in fees, and all I get is little punishments doled out by snotnose little children that aren't even old enough to have experienced selling on Ebay themselves.

Oh, and it is real convenient that this happens soon after sending in a complaint about how I was treated on the phone when Ebay themselves asks me to do a survey.

Now I get to make another call and spend forever on hold just to talk to some kid to try and explain they are limiting one account because of the limitations put on another account caused by the first account to begin with.

Fuck, it is so sad they have such a monopoly that there is just nowhere else to go.

Ebay,Sellers: Are you costing yourself money by offering free shipping?,"I sell a lot of stuff and have experimented with offering free shipping vs charging shipping. I see many people suggesting using free shipping, and I do this a little bit, but I feel like I've had better luck selling items for a higher price with a purchase price plus shipping rather than lumping it in with item total.

For instance: I'll go to sell a video game. The going price is about $15, and many are selling for about $15 with free shipping. Rather than price mine at $14.50 with Free Shipping, I've found if I list it at $13 +$3 shipping it sells just as fast, but nets me $1.50 more.

Similarly for larger, and more expensive items I've sold a few things for say, $74 +$5 shipping when many items are selling for ~$75 with free shipping. 

I guess I'm saying that so many buyers just look at the asking price and don't factor the shipping into the equation that, at least in my experience, you might be hurting yourself by offering free shipping.

Anyone else have any thoughts on this, or evidence to change my mind? With eBay prices ever increasing I'm always looking to get the max for my items.",11.0,5,2013-07-04,EBAY,0.03831224516034126,0.9187107086181641,0.042977072298526764

Ebay,Question about Paypal changing payment method of eBay invoice,"I'm new to eBay. I have my invoice payment set up to automatically come out of Paypal. The 1 month went by fine. The second month, the entire amount of funds available did not cover the total invoice so they zeroed out my Paypal and took the rest from my bank account. No problem.

Ebay,"/r/ebay, can I have your advice on a bad purchase?","I purchased an Apple Computer via eBay this past week. I not only purchased a replacement key for the keyboard but also purchased a 30 dollar (including shipping) operating system because the previous owner had wiped the hard drive for security purposes. This totaled about 37 dollars for me ultimately.

I receive the computer this morning, to find it poorly packed. It definitely had LOTS of room to move around in the box while it was shipped and, not surprisingly, the disc drive on the computer did not work despite the description saying that the computer ""ran great"". Not only that, but upon calling Apple support while trying to troubleshoot the computer, I found out that the computer was a 2006 model even though it had been advertised as a 2007 model.

I contacted the seller and let them know that I would need to return the item and was expecting a refund. They told me that they would refund me when I received the item. How do I go about handling this? Do I simply send back the item? Do I open up a ""item not as described"" case? Should I mention the year model discrepancy? How should I discuss the seller paying for return shipping? (I only think it is fair since I have already spent 30+ dollars on a computer that I do not actually own anymore)

Ebay,"Seller delays and delays, then stops responding","Purchased an expensive item ($1600) on ebay.  The auction said it would take 7-10 days to ship.  It's been a month.  At first the guy responded to my messages in a reasonable amount of time, saying he was having trouble getting it from his supplier.  I finally opened a case.  Still no response.  I have to wait a few more days before ebay will step in and supposedly do something.

The guy has amazing feedback, over 1800.  100% positive.  Before buying, I read a LOT of the feedback (both him as buyer and seller) and it all looks legitimately positive.  It spans years, and there's myriad items he's sold.  A lot of them are expensive and some of them are for him selling the same item I am trying to purchase from him now for the same amount (or close to it).

2. May I leave my bubble mailers in my mailbox for my mailman to pick up for USPS? I have heard this is an unreliable method. How do I pay for shipping with this method? If I print out a label through eBay, am I able to pay shipping online and does USPS honor that?

3. Sort of an unrelated question but I'm genuinely curious... how do you mail your packages as an ebay seller? Do people just bring them in to their local post office? What about medium volume sellers, and high volume sellers? Is there any instance of people going in and out of the post office paying and unloading all of their shipments?

Ebay,Is this guy trying to beat me out of $200?,"Hey guys,

I recently bought a used Phone off eBay, for around $200 and some change, but that's not really here nor there, I contacted the guy and told him that I would pay him Late Wednesday/Early Thursday, and the money didn't come in at the time I expected so I contacted him to organize pay on delivery, and of course I had already checked out with pay on delivery, so paypal was already not an option at this point (because I had already checked out with pay on delivery).

The guy wasn't going for it so, we organised to pay through paypal, I paid him, and around that same time he stopped responding to my messages (which was on Friday), i've only sent him two (one to let him know that i've paid him and i'll leave positive feedback in lieu of the problems we encountered and one to ask him when he was going to post it), then I figured i'd give him the weekend, things get busy, might be a party guy, might have a family and he may not have had time to respond, so now I'm at this point,


I've contacted him with the confirmation email that I've paid him (as i'm writing this), from Paypal and now, I'm going to wait til' about this time tomorrow to see if he either a) posts it or gets back to me or b) ignores it

If B, should I be contacting Paypal with all of this information? (I also have screen shots of the receipts from the purchase) and all of our messages back and fourth 


Am I going about this the right way? 










**TL;DR Version:**

Bought Phone off eBay


Made agreement with seller when i'm gonna pay


Money didn't come in in time so I tried to push for pay on delivery, of which he declined to do so, 


Had already checked out with Pay on delivery so couldn't go proper paypal route.


Paid him money directly through paypal


Guy hasn't responded to any of my messages since then (which is 3, 2 of which where sent on friday and one just now)

Ebay,Selling in specific areas.,"First off I understand the risk, and I only plan to do this a few times a year to keep it low key. I do not plan on buying handfuls of clothing and red-flag myself. 
I work for an upscale clothing store in America and I have access to clearance stuff before it goes to the floor. I am allowed to buy it as an employee, and was curious about reselling it to a country that likes this brand of clothing.

Ebay,"Ebay store, time to take the plunge?","I am a top rated bronze power seller.  Already getting a 20% discount.  I average about 150-200 items available for sale with about 40-50 sales a month averaging about $30 (anywhere from $7-200 per item). These are my numbers for the last 1-2 years and I only see an increase in inventory happening. The past couple months I have considered opening the lowest tier store for the $16-20 per month cost.  Based on their calculators and the dozens of scenarios, I can save anywhere from $10-50 a month opening a store but with the promotions the last couple months of free listing fees, I have had no need to open a store

The benefits of opening a store are the extra 100 free listings and the 
discounted FVF for some categories.  You get a 150 free listings a month.

My question is can I have say 500 items in my ebay store and not have to pay a listing fee?  I'm under the impression that you can just keep items for sale in your store section, but they do not receive any type of promoting at ebay and are pretty hard to find, unless someone sees one of my other auctions and wants to find similar items that I am selling and they dig down into my store and make a purchase that way. Currently I have about 100 albums that I have yet to list as I have found with cds it sometimes takes months for the right buyer to come along.  So I want to get these records listed for sale, but I do not want to have to pay the 5 cent listing fees over and over each month if they take 6 months to sell on average and they're only $10 albums

I had assumed during this time my items had been shipped. On July sixth they sent me an message explaining things. I was irritated it had taken so long to contact me, but stuff happens. I asked them about sending me a corrected invoice. They responded last night, July 8th. The first email stated $8. I guess they had messed that up , as a I got a second email saying $10. Followed by a third asking me to make a payment through paypal, without an invoice. They could not figure out how to send a corrected invoice.

I have read ebays rules, as far as I can tell this is not allowed? I would feel to be protected if something was to go wrong?

1) Is there any great advantage to being a top rated seller? For instance, do you notice your items selling better because they supposedly have a better ranking in search results? And does the FVF discount make any considerable dent in your invoice each month?

Ebay,Should I leave negative feedback?,"I think I'm an overly nice person, and thus reluctant to leave negative feedback.

 But the other day I ordered a radio for my car (KDC 252u). I checked it out, and the crutchfield.com website said it would fit. Instead the company(or person?) sent me the KDC 255u. I checked this out on crutchfield and it said it would fit, but protrude about an inch out of the dash. Honestly though, I am fine with this. I opened a claim to see if he just mistakenly sent me the wrong radio. Keep in mind I did not open the package. I calmly asked for an exchange if he had one. He replied with terrible and unprofessional sentences with assumptions. This is his response

""hello why you open a case without sending us a message??? the 255 and 252 is exactly the same size! same radio the 255 is just the newer version. here is a link to metra web site that will show you which kit your car takes. http://www.metraonline.com/vfg please close the case that you open""

He pretty much ignored that I asked him if he had the one I ordered. And didn't listen to what I said about already seeing if it would fit.

I went back to crutchfield, and it now says that both radios will protrude (before It said the 252u would fit perfectly). I am 99% sure it has been updated since i looked it up because the reason I choose the 252u over the 255u was because it fit better.

Anyways, I responded that if it was the same size then everything should be fine. 

He replied telling me to get a dash kit to make sure it fit... so i guess he isn't fully reading my replys.

//// TL:DR /////

Reason the leave negative feedback:
They sent me the wrong radio, they didn't apologize or even offer to take it back, they barely read my claim and didn't respond appropriately. And most importantly, the radio is still listed, which means they are still selling 255us as 252us.

Ebay,Giving a negative rating for the first time in years. Questions about leaving it.,"I had posted before concerning a buyer who had messed up and forgotten to charge me shipping. They waited ten days to even bring it to my attention. I paid immediately for my purchases. They wanted me to pay additional shipping through PayPal. Outside of eBay,  I messaged them twice stating I would not pay without an eBay invoice.  They went ahead and sent me an invoice directly from PayPal anyway. 

They have a 98% approval rating and over 800 sales. 

Since the original invoice that has been paid since June 26th included 9 items, eBay customer service told me I had to file nine individual cases.

Now comes the part I am unsure about. I am leaving negative feedback for the seller because of their poor comninication and for never sending me items I rightfully won and paid for.

I have the option to leave feedback for each of the nine items. Part of me wanted to leave negative feedback for each item, but it seems like that would be an asshole move on my part, but then again the seller screwed me over.

Ebay,All these scam stories are scaring me...,"I've been looking through this subreddit and a few other eBay-based boards and sites and I've come across some crazy scam nightmare stories. I'm a relatively new seller with 25 Positive feedback in about 65 sales. I generally sell cheap, common items, and scam's haven't been my main focus. After all, the most I'd lose if i got scammed on most of my items is a couple bucks. I'm trying to step it up, and start selling larger items, but I want to be as careful as possible. Here's where the questions begin:
TLDR: New ebay seller, here's my questions:

* Would it be useful for me to record/photograph my packaging and shipping process? I saw a guy at the post office today ask for his boxes back after the postage stickers and bar codes were placed on the boxes. He photographed these stickers and gave the items back to the teller.

* What else can I do, any hints?",30.0,5,2013-07-12,EBAY,0.03184255585074425,0.9242078065872192,0.04394964128732681

Ebay,Inexperienced eBayer unsure how to handle buyer issue,"For the past few weeks I've been selling some electronics I no longer need. Smooth sailing so far. However, one buyer is turning out to be a problem and I'm unsure how I should handle it. Basically, a guy won a piece of electronics, I mail it out, everything seems fine at first. I hadn't originally put a power cable with the item pictures/descriptions, but when a potential buyer (not the eventual winner) asked if one would be included, I thought ""sure, I have extras, might as well throw one in."" I answered that one would be included and posted the answer to the listing. This, of course, was a recipe for forgetting to include it.

A couple days after the delivery was confirmed, I receive a message from the winner saying that there was no power cable and he has already purchased one. Also says a feature of the item doesn't work (a problem I never had) and wants to know how this can be resolved. I told him that I would be glad to accept a return. He responds days later that he would rather I pay him for the power cable he purchased and a repair of the item.

My thoughts are that I reiterate that I would rather give him a full refund and that he ship the item back to me. First, I'm not sure I believe an issue exists with the item and have no way of verifying the issue or his repair cost. Second, I would have been glad to ship the power cable to him at my own expense had he contacted me BEFORE buying one. This guy sells electronics on eBay, by the way, so I have a pretty hard time believing he had zero power cables in his life to test the item with. That fact also makes it even harder for me to believe that there is a legitimate problem with the item. This guy seems very shady to me. I wouldn't be surprised if he says he already had repairs done as well.

Lastly, is his asking me to pay him outside of eBay a violation of eBay's policies? It's not clear to me.

UPDATE: in case anyone stumbles into this thread with a similar problem. Everything went as these kind folks below predicted. Offered him a full refund once more and said I could ship the power cable to him. Asks for power cable, then tries one more time to make me feel bad for the ""loss"" he will incur from ""repairing"" my item.

Ebay,Scammed by buyer - first time I've seen this one,"-Buyer with good feedback pays for item ($250 + shipping) shipped to Germany from Hong Kong

-Standard registered airmail. Takes about 5-7 days

-After a week, buyer claims the item has not arrived. I tell him to please wait, sometimes customs can take a while

-A few days later, files a dispute. Registration shows ""arrived in country"" but nothing more. Basically they are waiting for him to pay import taxes 

-I submit registration info to ebay. They let it sit for the 10 days or whatever it is. Since he never paid the taxes, the registration still shows as not received

-Ebay rules in buyer's favour, tells me that I did not provide registration.

-After buyer receives refund, he pays custom fees, and receives the product

-Registration now shows ""Item delivered"" a few days after ebay refunded

-On top of all this, my ""Appeal Decision"" link is missing. I am supposed to have 45 days to appeal, case was closed less than a month ago

-So now I am stuck without the product, out the shipping fee, lost $250 plus my account probably has some sort of flag on it for losing a dispute.

Ebay charged me $25 to make this transaction, and basically allowed the buyer to completely screw me over. I can't appeal through the site and now I have to jump through hoops for what I don't know... I doubt they will refund the money to me, and they can't force him to pay now can they?

My concern is obviously the lack of seller protection. And if they suffer buyers remorse they could just file a did not receive claim and win automatically.

Ebay,"Buyer purchased phone, says it won't work in her zip code.","So last month I saw an opportunity to make a few quick bucks.  If you go on Straight Talk's website you can purchase and LG Optimus Q Refurb for $20, only thing is you have to also buy the $45 airtime card with it.  Long story short I purchased a few of these and split them up on ebay, selling the card for about face value and made about $30 each on the phones.  

It went pretty smoothly save for one buyer.  She was a brand new ebayer which always worries me, but she paid for her item and I shipped it with delivery confirmation.  After getting it she said she couldn't get the micro-sd card to work.  As I clearly stated in my auction that I don't do returns, I referred her to the Straight Talk warranty; they will ship customers a pre-paid shipping box then replace the item for free.  She had very suspicious trouble with even getting through the system, so much so that I basically had to walk her through ""call here, press 3 here, press 2 here, etc."" So after a month I figured I was done with it.  She now sent me some sort of sob story where I'm guessing the phone was never broken in the first place and that it ""won't work in her zip code.""  Here is her text from the message she sent me:

""I am so incredibly sorry for this inconvenience, but I have run out of options. This phone will not work in my zip code, because my area is too rural. I understand that you refuse to do returns, but I am honestly begging you pleas sir, I am completely broke and have no other options. I am so very desperate, please sir let me return the phone. I was completely unaware that the phone would not work in my zip code, and straight talk never once mentioned that to me. I didn't even get to use the phone once, I have its packaging and every part, it's essentially brand-new still. I am so so sorry, but I need a phone desperately and there is nothing I can do about this one. Please, please allow me to return it. Thank you for your time.""

Now I've followed all of the rules and have a perfect feedback record.  Do I have enough on my side in order for ebay to remove her negative feedback when I refuse the return?  It's obvious that the phone is fine, I shipped it super quickly like the other phones and she tried to lie a few weeks ago about the SD card issue.  I know most of you on here just say ""well if you don't want the negative take the return"" but I don't like being scammed and really think ebay should be on my side in this one.  All of our communication has been through the internal ebay system and this is still her only transaction she's ever had.  In addition, Straight Talk's website shows full coverage in her area.

Thoughts?  Am I totally up shit's creek here, or if I politely decline the return will ebay get my back and remove her negative feedback?  Any help would be appreciated.",13.0,0,2013-07-14,EBAY,0.044448260217905045,0.9246956706047058,0.03085607849061489

Ebay,My items keep getting taken down but the transaction is never completed. This has happened 6 times in the last 8 hours. Please help!,"Last night I listed a bunch of item I have never sold before. They are just a bunch of sewing patterns and I listed them for $5 each just to get rid of them. After about an hour of listing them, someone, I'll call them Goldie, clicked to purchase one but didn't pay. I listed one of the patterns on a secondary ebay account I have. Goldie purchased one from that account as well but didn't pay. When I saw this, I relisted both of them right away. Then a few hours later, Goldie 'purchased' one of the relisted ones again. That confirmed to me that there was no intent to buy. No one would need 2 of these. So I went in and added 'Goldie' to my block list. Then a few hours later, the patterns were 'purchased' again, this time by different users. Neither users paid for the patterns this time either. I have searched eBay and Google trying to figure out how to make it when one has to pay right away but can't find anything.

Ebay,What are my options? Item (probably) stolen by buyer's housemates,"I've had a case opened against me by a guy who I sold a hard drive to last month. He messaged me prior to winning and after winning asking me to send the item unrecorded, meaning that it wouldn't require a signature at the door. His reason for this was that he lives in a shared house and has had problems with people claiming his mail and parcels. I agreed to his request and sent the item unrecorded, with next-day delivery, which I have the receipt for. I stressed to him that I could not be held responsible if the package didn't arrive, to which he replied that this was fine.

Yesterday I woke up to an email about the open case and him requesting a full refund. I have spoken to ebay customer support via live chat and they have said that if it is not resolved between us within 8 days then it will be referred to them for their decision. My and the buyer's messages back and forth clearly prove my above story. If the case is referred then will ebay be able to see these messages? What should I expect realistically?

I am in the process of maybe selling several items totaling almost $700.00. So I need to wait almost two months to get all that money! I guess I am sort of understanding of the new changes, because when I was selling back in 2005 I got ripped off twice. One of the times for almost $500.00. I just feel they went a little bit extreme.

Ebay,"[PayPal] Wife was charged ~$90; disputed within half an hour, PayPal took the money ~40 hours later","Sunday night I got a message from my wife (I was at work) that somebody had used (hacked?) her PayPal to send themselves about $90. Since she was up, she got the email and filed a dispute with PayPal; they said they'd stop it and would contact her with more information. She changed her password on both PayPal, and our bank to be safe.

Nothing happened yesterday, but just today PayPal withdrew the funds from our checking account, and told her they were holding it pending investigation.

I'm really not familiar with PayPal. Way I see it, an online entity has fraudulently taken funds out of our bank account, which is a felony, though there may be (probably is) something in PayPal's terms that gets them out of that. In any case, I think we should be able to solve the problem with the bank. Wife wants to deal with PayPal.

I looked at my wife's email, and as far as I can tell, it was a simple direct money transfer to a Hotmail account. Nothing she bought equals (or comes close) to that amount.

All the horror stories I've heard about PayPal come out in the buyer's favor. Buy a laptop, pay with PayPal, say the laptop never arrives? PayPal gives the buyer his money back. I don't mean to slight PayPal unfairly; that's just what I've heard. In any case, we're not selling (i.e. getting paid by PayPal), we're the buying party (i.e. paying with PayPal) (even though we didn't actually buy anything) and buyer protection is the big thing with these (also Google Wallet, which I use).

Just wondering if anyone here has any advice. I know next to nothing (go ahead and assume I know nothing) about PayPal; my wife knows a little more, but for the sake of argument, assume she knows nothing as well.

Ebay,Return item or get seller to ship remaining pieces?,"I purchased a set of brake pads for the front of an Audi S4. The thing about this setup if you are not familiar is there are 8 smaller pads (4 to each axle) instead of 4 larger ones (2 to each axle). The listing was posted with the condition ""new."" When I received the order I only received 4 pads (enough to do one axle), so I did some looking and they are sold everywhere else as a complete front axle set of 8. (A side note, I have never seen brake pads sold in sets that couldn't accommodate both wheels [either front or back] as it isn't considered safe to replace one at a time.)

I am asking for them to ship the remaining parts that should have came in the box. They are offering to allow me to return them. I have linked them to another retailer selling the same part number where it clearly states that MKD912 is a complete set for the front axle. They then linked me the the manufacturers page (not the product page, the home page) stating that it should validate their point. Looking on the product page it clearly shows 8 pieces belong in the box as I assert, I sent them this link. 

Should I continue to push for the correct items or is it a losing fight and I should accept the refund?

The same seller has more of the same item listed, if I win a dispute will ebay do anything concerning the other items that are being sold as the same thing (I am buying item 1 of 5) as they are waiting to be bought as new, but are not?

Ebay,"Bought a tablet for parts to repair my current tablet, the item arrived water damaged and parts completely unusable.

I open up the item so that I can take a connector from it that I need to repair my current tablet and I find that the entire inside of the item has been corroded due to water damage, rendering all parts unusable.

The thing is, the item was sold as ""For parts or not working"", and the seller described it as non-functional, wont turn on, with the internal components untested and some residue on  the inside of the glass on the screen. It was being sold as is.

From what I found eBay states that For Parts is defined as: 
&gt;""An item that does not function as intended and is not fully operational. This includes items that are defective in ways that render them difficult to use, items that require service or repair, or items missing essential components. ""
The thing is this item is completely nonoperational, and is beyond repair or salvage.

Is there anything that I can do, or is buying an item ""for parts"" means that you might end up buying complete garbage?

No ""funny buisness"" by Friday he might ship them that morning.  He keeps THREATING a  Refund and says he will just relist the auction. He's said this twice.

Ebay,"Scammed on eBay, they are unwilling to help because of the Data Protection Act. Is there anything I can do?","Hi All,

In the last couple of weeks my father has been scammed. He bought a rather expensive item from somebody (~£4000), but instead of paying through PayPal, did a bank transfer - reason given by the seller was to ""save costs"". Obviously this was the wrong thing to do, but it was such a great deal and all the information on the item seemed to be correct, as well as photos being provided for extra requests. The account had +100 rep, no negative feedback and has been active for about 3 years. The police are also unwilling to do anything, as are both the banks.

As you can imagine, as soon as the payment went through communication from the account went quiet. After realising this was indeed a scam, we contacted eBay who said as we hadn't used PP there was nothing they could do in terms of reclaiming money (which is understandable). However, they won't even provide an address, name or email address associated with the account (which they obviously have) because of the already mentioned Data Protection Act. This seem a bit disingenuous of them, as it's clearly a fraudulent listing (the description and images were part of a listing from 3 years ago in the US), which means the seller never even had an item with the intent to sell it.

The account is still active, as in it's bought items since we have been scammed - which is mad; this person must be a very stupid individual.

What we do have (through past people he has bought from, is a name and an address). The name is likely to be false, but the address is in a small town where this is likely the right place. As we also have bank details, are there any legal actions we can take that anyone might have experienced/used before?

Does anyone have any advise on what action we may be able to take with eBay, maybe to pressure them into giving us more information on the _active_ user? I know it's a bit of a long shot, but any advise would be greatly appreciated.

Ebay,Hefty Trash Bag of Baseball Cards.,"So I was at a yard sale looking for things to maybe sell on eBay. It was an older couple having the garage sale. I found a trash bag full of baseball cards from the late 80's early 90's, made by topps, upper deck, Donruss, and fleer. I am guessing it was their kids collection and he is probably unaware his parents threw all of his cards into a trash bag with a piece of tape on the bag saying $10.00. 

I bought it and with about 85% of the cards in great condition only to find out most of the cards from that era were so largely produced you can purchase entire sets and unopened original wax boxes for less than $10.00. The newest cards in the trash bag are topps 1995 with only about 100 of them. I went through most of the cards and it appears the person that owned them pulled most of the good players and high value cards. The bag had maybe 2K-3K of baseball cards and I have only been through about 600 and have not found any big player rookies or rare. I wanted an opinion on the best way to sell these cards. I was thinking on doing random lots of 20 with the same brand and year of card for about $1.00 bid no buy out and no reserve.",10.0,5,2013-07-20,EBAY,0.030758056789636612,0.9332987070083618,0.03594324365258217

I can swear to you that I used this ps3 for months with absolutely no problems. It ran great, was quiet and never froze or anything. I'm beginning to think maybe they just wanted to play the games (one of which was the last of us) and then return it. I replied saying that I used that thing with no problems and if it worked for 3 days I fail to see how it was my doing if it suddenly stopped working. What can I do about this?

I have two listings that show up in my Ebay account however when I searched to see where my item stood in the listings I could not find it.

I did the same with my second listing and it showed the same results. For whatever reason Ebay is not showing the listings to anyone other than me.

Ebay,Claim disputed over SD card.,"Foolishly, I mailed an SD card without tracking. I've done letter mailing with numerous other items just because I was blind to the consequences.

Anyways, today is that day that someone took a bite with my trust. I sent an SD card to someone, and since they had 1K+ rating, I didn't bother to second guess them.

They paid on the 11th of this month, and I sent the SD card through letter mail on the 12th. A week later -- today, the 19th -- I was told that a dispute was opened.

This person never contacted me before opening the dispute, and I'm not exactly sure where to go from here.

I've noticed a couple of things with this person and the whole dilemma, though -- for one, my shipping method states that the average arrival time would be August 2nd. &amp; secondly, the person's payment name wasn't the same as the shipping address name.

I really don't think there's anything I can do about this, since I didn't get tracking, but if there's any advice I could get on possibly getting a chance to counter this, then I would be much thankful.

Ebay,How do buyers get away with this? Does eBay care at all?,"http://i.imgur.com/oTPPRE9.jpg

We just got a negative feedback for someone saying they didn't get their item and we ignored their attempt to contact us.

First of all, the item shows as delivered. Second of all, the buyer NEVER contacted us. My email, ebay link to contact us, and phone # is plastered all over the place. They are 110% bullshitting and did NOT attempt to rectify the issue.

I am a one-man shop, there is no chance someone ""else"" picked up the phone, etc. There are no messages from this person or emails at all, nothing.

I have a flawless record on eBay, I sell about 300 items a month and literally ship same day ALWAYS. I reply to emails within minutes if at a computer, if not it's never more than a few hours.

Not only that, I re-ship items for FREE if people say they didn't get them, even if it shows as ""delivered"" (we all know the USPS sucks, and to maintain our excellent ratings this is just another thing we do to cover our ass).

What do I do? I already responded to the buyer very politely mentioning that we had received 0 contact and would love an opportunity to fix the issue.

Does eBay care at all about these bullshit feedback remarks?



**[Update]**

Just an update, as expected, eBay chose to do absolutely nothing with regards to this matter. Despite paying them thousands of dollars a month in fees and subscriptions, they simply don't care. They were nice on the phone, but they are not willing to assist.

The buyer is unresponsive and has not replied to any contact (still). Also, even after explaining how the buyer left multiple negative feedback for multiple sellers saying the same things (no reply, item not delivered), they still refused to assist me as a seller.

So the answer is (as expected), **Nope! eBay could care less about your reputation being damaged by bullshit buyers.**

They'll apologize for the issue, since they're paid to do so, but they won't actually fix it. Not really sure why I wasted my time trying.

Ebay,Some Packaging and Shipping Questions,"I have a few more questions for everyone...

1. Can you only use priority mail boxes from usps.com for priority mail? Probably a dumb question and I'm assuming so, but just checking.

2. On http://uspssupplies.ebay.com/ there is an eBay Shoebox
Box Dimensions: 7 1/2 "" X 5 1/8"" X 14 3/8"". Is this suitable for books, and could I send this as media mail? If not, where would I find boxes to send for media mail? Any tips to safely package books so they arrive okay at a low cost?

3. Where do you get your boxes from? I already have a stock of priority boxes and envelopes from usps but whenever I order things from ebay I never receive priority packages so are most people against this?

4. Last question - pertaining to delivery of said boxes. I heard there is a limit to how many packages you can ship through usps at any given day. How do big sellers get past this limit, and how much is it? Also is arranging a usps pickup for my packages a smarter move than dropping them off at the post office?

Thanks.

Edit: Oops, one more question. I've never had to really weigh what I've sold before because I've exclusively sold trading cards, so I just got my scale and I'm curious as to how everyone uses theirs.

Ebay,Hard drive listed as wrong type,"So I was browsing for hard drives on ebay and when you do so you can filter the various types of drives you are looking for.  I filtered for only SATA and SSD drives.  I came upon a very good deal for a 7200RPM 4TB drive and the seller had great feedback so I purchased it.  When it came, I saw that it looked in good order and left positive feedback as I always do, but in this case I did so a bit prematurely.  Yesterday when I got around to trying to install the drive, I realized that the pin structure was slightly different.  After googling the model number, I discovered that it was in fact an SAS drive instead of what the seller had listed it as.  This is a very small niche of drives used only for servers and enterprise storage solutions.  On the one hand, it means I got an even better deal because the drive is worth more being an SAS drive, but on the other hand it means I have to install a separate controller card for it to work in my system.  I went to Fry's and they didn't even know what an SAS drive was.  I was able to locate a controller card with cables on ebay for $25, which I ordered yesterday.  I messaged the seller alerting him to the issue and politely requested he compensate me for the $25 as a) he listed the drive in the wrong category and b) did not specify the drive as SAS in either the title nor description.  He messaged me back saying it was an ""obvious"" error because the picture of the drive he uploaded showed an SAS configuration.  I'm here to tell you guys, no one would be able to tell that based off of a quick glance, and like I said SAS drives are a very, very small niche of users so it's ludicrous to think the picture alone would have been enough.

I think I am pretty sound moving forward with a case if he decides not to refund me $25.  I asked him what his final intentions were and if he refuses to refund me I will indeed open a case.  My question to you experts is a) given the facts, do you think I am being unreasonable?  I chose the cheapest card with cables available, as these cards can get up to $400 pretty quickly.  b) will ebay allow me to request a partial refund instead of returning it?  I don't want to return the drive, as that would result in a $10 shipping charge for me and then waiting for the time to ship to him and then for me to purchase another drive.  As it stands now I'll have a working drive in my system on Friday when the controller card comes.  

So yeah sorry it's a fairly technical problem, but at the heart of it lies a product that was listed in the wrong category, I made the mistake of buying it due to that, and in my due diligence I was able to right the wrong or ""make myself whole"" as far as the transaction is concerned for a much smaller price than it would have cost to return the drive.  I politely requested the seller compensate me for this and offered to show him the auction I had purchased to prove I wasn't trying to screw him, and his first reaction was to completely disregard me.  Your advice would be greatly appreciated.

*Update*

Well thankfully this had a quick resolution.  The seller sent me  the $25 partial refund along with a nasty message that I should be more responsible as a buyer and to never purchase from him again.  I thanked him, copy/pasted the message into the case file, closed it and let him keep his positive feedback.  In the end I am happy with the resolution.",29.0,0,2013-07-23,EBAY,0.0803905799984932,0.8898063898086548,0.029802976176142693

Ebay,"Hey guys, I just wanted some advice on how I should auction my Uncle's large Star Wars Collection","Hi guys, my Uncle left my family a plethora of Star Wars action figures, models, memorabilia and lightsabers, and I was wondering what would be the best way to sell it all from people who have had experience with selling items such as this. 

Sadly most of it is newer stuff, from the three latest movies with the oldest items being from 1997. I don't think we can get much more than what he paid for, so I was wondering if there are ways of making it a more appealing bid, such as grouping the whole set of figures together,  selling them individually or making a large auction of a large set of the items. 

There is around 400-500 different items, ranging from Episode 1 unopened collectable card boxes, to Hasbro lightsabers to a large amount of action figures.

If there are communities that would be interested in this sort of stuff, that I could show the collection to that would be useful as well. that would help as well. I don't really want to try to take it to a convention to sell, since I'm out of town when the bigger ones take place. 

Most if not all is in decent condition and are in their original packaging so I don't think that will be an issue either. I can provide specifics on what sets I have for specific recommendations as well. 

So please share your tips or experience in selling this collection please.

Ebay,"Bought an item that is clearly refurbished, when it was only marked as used. What would you do?","I won an auction for a DS that was listed as Used. Upon arrival, I made a note that several points on the device had been tampered with. If you're interested they are as follows:

- top part's screw covers are after-market rubberised lugs that don't sit well
- bottom screen has been replaced but is sitting askew
- bottom slot dust cover is the typical after-market cheap replacement that doesn't sit comfortably

All in all, I doubt this would be picked up by many other people. It's a very well done refurbishment, aside from the bottom screen. I am very experienced with buying and selling of refurbished items, and can spot them a mile away. 
However I'm not sure how to proceed. I've sent an email to the seller politely informing them that I've found it to be refurbished and not factory original. I'm not sure that I'll get a reply however. 
I'm not sure if I should just leave positive feedback and sell the item myself as refurbished, or raise a claim.

Ebay,"Question for a friend who sold something on Ebay, buyer is a B-word, Ebay/PayPal are giving her the runaround","Hi all, first post here. I have a friend (I'll call her Mary) who sold an item on ebay. The woman who bought it gave her the address, and she noticed it was a military base but didn't think anything of it. She sent off the item and has tracking for it. 

Mary shipped the item on June 25, a couple weeks later the buyer messaged Mary asking where the item is. Mary looked into it and the military base this woman is on is in Japan (we are in the US). The tracking information said it was still en route. The only information she is able to get is that it was shipped to California, and then there is no more information until it arrives in Japan. She knows it made it to California. You would think this lady would understand it might take some extra time to get to a military base across the world, but she didn't and on July 9 opened up a case against my friend.

Since then, PayPal has taken the money back out of Mary's account. She contacted Ebay and told them that she DID send the item, it is on its way, and that it wasn't fair that the money was taken out of her account. Ebay said when she has confirmation from the tracking that it was delivered, they will pay her back. OK, fine.

Now Ebay keeps sending Mary threatening emails in all caps demanding the $200. PayPal has already taken the money out of her account. She cannot reply to the email (of course). She called Ebay, and they told her to call PayPal. She called PayPal, and guess what they said? Yup, she needs to talk to Ebay.

She spent TWO HOURS on the phone last night getting transferred around both Ebay and PayPal's customer service, all because of an impatient bitch who doesn't understand that mail going to a military base in a foreign country takes a while. Mary just keeps getting put on hold time and time again, explaining the story, getting transferred, getting put on hold, explaining the story, on and on and on. She tried again today while at work and spent another hour explaining and getting transferred.

Does anyone have any idea what course of action she can take next?? This is ridiculous. It should be between PayPal and Ebay, she doesn't have the money any more. And why did Ebay not look into the fact that this woman lives so far away before blindly believing her side of the story and taking money away from my friend? Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

TL;DR  Buyer got impatient, said she hasn't received item that is on its way to her. PayPal took money back, hasn't given it to Ebay. Ebay keeps hounding my friend for the money. 

Edit: Added some more details, like dates. Also, as of today the tracking still just says it's ""en route.""

Ebay,"About to leave my first negative, ever.","Here is the story: 

Its late at night, and I should have been in bed, instead of buying games, whatever. I see a game in ""Very Good"" condition I've been wanting for a decent (not great) price. It is $10ish off the going rate, so I buy it. 

Game arrives in a pretty beat-up package. I pull the game out, and a slip of paper falls out... with the seller's address, as well as ""Ebay refund $55 (10 more than I paid) - game crashes on start-up."" I inspect the disc, and see there are huge scratches through the data layer*. This disc is clearly broken, and will never play. So, I go look at the seller's item history. He's sold this particular game 3 times. (He's not a big time VG seller, so its clearly the same copy.) He's clearly well aware that the item is broken after two other people returned it. He didn't even bother to remove the previous buyer's note about the refund, probably just resold it.

So, of course, I tell him I'll be returning it for a refund. He responds ""Return it for a refund, I'm sorry it's not what you wanted."" REALLY? I DIDN'T WANT A BROKEN GAME? 

So, I send the item back. A week or so later, I see it arrived 3 days prior. So, now, at every point, he is just banking on hoping someone won't see all the parts of a refund through. I obviously contact the seller and ask where my refund is. He pays via paypal echeck, to clear on the 24th. 

It of course, doesn't clear. Escalate the case, and eBay refunds me. (I'm curious where the money came from.) I'm still out $3 for shipping, all the time devoted to keeping on top of this horrible seller, so, I feel justified leaving my first negative feedback in quite a few years of dealing on ebay.

He begins to tell me to ""stop crying over $9"" and the I need to ""calm my ass down"". He also implied that I was lucky because he could have ""been an asshole and just kept my money""(lol wut?). I had to explain to him how the ebay/paypal process works. Anyways after the extreme rudeness, it was clear he wasn't going to reimburse me and he stopped responding to my messages. I kept my cool the whole time even though I wanted to punch him in the face.

Its obvious that the item came damaged due to his inadequate packaging(a envelope, really??). Its not even the shipping company's fault. Would negative feedback be appropriate? He did refund me instantly. But I'm still out $9 with nothing to show and $250 of my credit limit(out of $500) taken up for 3-5 days for the refund to clear. Also is there anything else I should/could do? Thanks for any help!",10.0,3,2013-07-27,EBAY,0.0811268538236618,0.8873350024223328,0.031538110226392746
Ebay,UPS Tracking delivered - buyer claim not received?,"Hooo boy, I'm sure we see a lot of these. Long story short, someone purchased an item from me a few weeks back, and I shipped it out a day later, only to get a message back from the buyer ten or so days later claiming they did not receive. 

Following that, I immediately checked the label, which says delivered. I remember her address being in an apartment complex, so I did mention that and asked her to check with her neighbors, and her apartment manager. No dice. She demanded that I open up a claim to UPS, which I did much to my own inconvenience. She starts hassling me every few days asking for status updates, and UPS gets back to me a while later and they said that the package was acknowledged as delivered, and they wanted me to check in with her and ask. Of course, she claims she didn't receive it, so I had to go all the way back to that UPS office, and ask them to either reopen the investigation or file a claim to get the money back. 

So, my question is, did her package get legitimately stolen, or did it just end up in a classical scam case where the buyer tries to get away? And in the worst possible case, if she opens up a Paypal claim on me, who would win that fight? 

Thanks guys.",4.0,3,2013-07-27,EBAY,0.030508248135447502,0.9001315832138062,0.06936012208461761
Ebay,Ebay seller threatens not to accept return item unless I give positive feedback,"I bought an antique and it turns out to be fake.

I pm the seller letting them know I will return the item once it reaches me . ( Korean post is slow). The buyer tells me that I have to leave a positive feedback that he typed out verbatim or else he might not refund me.

Ebay,Just a rant,"I know that eBay likes to screw sellers over, and I just need to rant quickly. I had just gotten a new phone, and so I decided to sell my old one on eBay. It had a few minor scratches and stuff, which were all noted on the listing. The person bought it, I sent it to her, and all seemed to be ok.

About 3 days or so later, she sends me a message that says that she actually doesn't like the phone, and would I please take it back? Now, I just didn't want to deal with this, and I specified ""no returns unless damaged"" in the listing, so I told her no. Within 15 minutes, I get a notification that she opened a case against me saying that the phone doesn't work, and that a person at Verizon told her that because of the ""unmentioned damage,"" the LTE radio came loose. I replied to the case and included a copy of the message she sent me, along with my mention of the minor damage in the listing.

Of course, eBay sided with the buyer, and I had to refund her the money. I get the phone back, plug my SIM in, and it works perfectly. A day or two after she gets her money back, I get a message from her that basically says ""Haha, I win, you lose.""

Ebay,First bad Buying experience [rant],"Well it was bound to happen sooner or later, but I've finally had my first bad experience buying things on ebay. Here comes the rant:

About a month ago I won an auction for a used PS3. The item was listed and pictured in fantastic condition. So I payed via paypal within minutes after the auction closed.  The seller contacted me stating that he had a little bit of a shipping mix up, but all was well and it should arrive only slightly late. Great! My PS3 would be here soon. I couldn't wait to play Uncharted and God of War finally!

A few weeks later my package arrives at the local post office. I was so anxious I took an hour off of work to head over and pick it up. This was the last fond memory of this transaction.

When I get to the post office I am handed a box that looks in very rough shape. Not only that, but the box looks a little too small to have everything I bought in it and have room for any Styrofoam. Upon unboxing this mess I found everything jammed tightly into the box. The PS3 was naked in the box and pressed tightly to the corner. What a disaster. 

I pulled out the console only to hear plastic rattling around in side. On closer examination there were cracks in multiple locations. The power switch on the device didn't work.  The thing was nearly DoA with the exception that it could be powered on via the controller. [Album](http://imgur.com/a/zRtcV)

Obviously I this isn't what I purchased so I contacted the seller. He refused to offer any refund... I opened a case with Ebay and tried to reason with him. I asked if there was any middle ground that we could meet at since this was broken during shipping. He declined the offer stating that he shouldn't have to pay for USPS's mishandling of his package.  He then proceeded to contact me through my personal facebook account somehow and tell me not to worry that we'll both get a refund if I escalate the case.  I don't respond to him on FB. I proceed to escalate the case which eventually results in a ruling in my favor after nearly a month of having to deal with this. EBay sends me a shipping label and I should get a refund once the item is returned.  

After the ruling this guy again contacts me on FB. Now that he KNOWS he's going to be forced to give me a refund, he offers to refund me $50 of the $200 I paid if I just keep what I have. I haven't responded to that and have simply shipped the item back to him and await my full refund. 

This looks to have turned out OK for me, but seriously fuck sellers like this. Learn how to package your items, it says right in the FAQs that its the sellers responsibility to get the item to the buyer as it was advertised. Buyers don't get to package the item, they don't get to pick the company that ships the item, and they can't purchase insurance for the item when YOU ship it. Not only that but if your item is ruined during shipping and the buyer is willing to work with you, don't wait until after you are forced to give a refund to try and work something out.

Ebay,"Bad experience selling on eBay, giving it up","This week I've had two buyers receive my very first two items I've ever sold on eBay. I was excited when I received the payment, secured safe shipping and sent both items off...

My first item was for $37, it was a game without original packaging, as listed in my auction... however when the buyer received the game, he complained about it not being as described (which it was), and wanted a full refund. I told him that it was exactly as described, he took pictures and sent them back and they matched up exactly how I listed it on eBay... after arguing back-and-forth like that for a few hours, he opened a case and after researching into it, I was essentially screwed by the eBay Buyer's Protection, so I agreed to give a full refund once the item has been returned.

Second item, a book, sold for $155 on eBay... got a nice box, threw in some bubble wrap... which mind you, this is how I received the item, perfect condition, kept it in the box since I got it... buyer receives it, says book was inadequately packed and shipping, says book is damaged and that he doesn't want it anymore unless he receives a $90 discount... (it was a rare book for a video game), he REFUSED to provide pictures, I told him absolutely not will I give him a discount, so he opened a case, and I agreed for a full refund once I receive the item.

Now, I looked into the Seller Protection and I followed the steps and submitted a complaint in eBay for both of these people and I thought there was something I can do, but after lots of research of other people that have same issues, there really isn't anything I can do because of eBay's Buyer's Protection... it feels like it's a system that's in place that people can simply change their mind, make some false claim, and get their money back...

I'm completely done with eBay.",14.0,3,2013-07-31,EBAY,0.051024556159973145,0.9115769267082214,0.0373985730111599
Ebay,"Auction winner with 0 feedback, from non-shipping country. How did this get through in the first place?","I set up my selling with all the restrictions to prevent fraud that I could, and specifically to this issue, I blocked bidders from places I don't ship.

The account appears to be obviously fraudulent (handle is obnoxious, email associated with the account us similarly obnoxious). The account details say that the user is from Norway. 

I've opened a case, but my main question is, how did this happen? Why didn't eBay's filters catch this? What can I do to prevent this in the future?",4.0,3,2013-07-31,EBAY,0.4253592789173126,0.5580162405967712,0.01662445068359375

Ebay,"Potential new Ebay user, scared by PayPal.",So as the title suggests I'm looking to start using Ebay to unload some objects with actual (albiet mediocre) value. I've grown weary of the limited exposure that craigslist gives your items and am ready to give this a go. My concern is in giving PayPal my bank information. I understand they are an accredited website that millions of people use. But giving out information that sensitive is hard to do. Pretty much I'm just hoping to find assurances that PayPal won't screw me over by having my banking information,11.0,2,2013-07-31,EBAY,0.01951747201383114,0.923409640789032,0.05707281455397606

Ebay,Are there common seller scams against buyers?,"I don't know if this is a silly question, but I ask because I'm relatively new to selling and I want to be aware.  

For example, this is currently happening to me:

One of my auctions didn't sell, but I recieved a message from a user who has an offer for it.  This isn't through the eBay Best offer thing, but just a message.

First off, is this against eBay rules?  My auction is done and it didn't sell, so I assume not.
Second, is this possibly some sort of scam?  I mean, he's been a member since 2001 and has a couple hundred feedback, all positive.  So on the surface, everything seems fine and I'm planning on going through with it.  I just don't know if this is a regular thing, or if this is some scam and I'm just too new as a seller to be aware of it.  I mean, as long as take the same precautions I take through forums and what-not to sell, then I should be ok, right?",5.0,2,2013-07-31,EBAY,0.034282468259334564,0.9294448494911194,0.036272644996643066
