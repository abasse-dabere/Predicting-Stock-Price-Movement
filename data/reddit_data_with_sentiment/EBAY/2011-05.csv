Ebay,Why bid on an item and not pay?,"I had a listing for a Macbook Pro that someone with zero feedback bid on and won.  I am very wary of him because he has no feedback.  I thought it might be a scammer but I googled his username and I got back a page of results that all pointed to the same guy in Nevada.  So it looks like a real person, but after winning the auction he has not replied to any of my messages and it has been over a day.  Am I just being paranoid and I should wait a week or should I assume he got cold feet and doesn't want to buy it anymore?",10,7,2011-05-05,EBAY,0.039243750274181366,0.8872311115264893,0.07352512329816818

Ebay,Buying from sellers with 0 feedback.,"Long time eBayer here, first time I've come across an issue like this;

I'm looking to buy a phone from eBay. I've never had a problem with stuff I've bought before, but this seems a bit different. [This phone here](http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=120723203743&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT) is the cheapest I've seen looking around (via buy it now) and all the specs are correct. It seems legit.

I have no issue with buying from 0 feedback sellers, but this one seems different, because the username is clearly one of those Chinese ones (yet located in Australia!) and he only has one item, which is significantly cheaper than other eBay listings of this item.

Usually I would ignore it, but the price is just so good, that I'm actually tempted to get it anyway. What could go wrong?

**Edit:** Looks like it was too good to be true. The listing has been removed. Hopefully those other guys didn't get screwed over. Looks like I'll have to spend a bit more, but at least I'll know it's legit. My initial hunch was right. Thanks, though.",8,3,2011-05-12,EBAY,0.05369122326374054,0.884853184223175,0.061455562710762024

Ebay,Avoid eBay Shipping Final Value Fee?,"It seems that eBay only charges me a FVF for shipping if I print out a label through eBay/Paypal. The items that I bought postage for at a physical USPS locations are not charged this fee. 

Just curious but is it possible to avoid the FVF for shipping if instead of printing a label through ebay, I use USPS Print and Ship service? Or 
will I just get smacked with fees at the end of the month?

It really is a shame ebay started to take a cut of the shipping pie too! It's just going to lead to inflated costs. I know they have to deal with people who chare absurd shipping costs but DAMN...

EDIT: woops, never mind. Just got charged the fee a few days later. =(",3,1,2011-05-13,EBAY,0.05476941168308258,0.911487877368927,0.033742744475603104

Ebay,So I missed an auction that had multiple items in it. I want to contact the buyer to ask if he wanted to sell one of the items to me. How can I get his ebay name? see comments,"Yeah, I know its against ebay's TOS .... dont care. I just want to contact the guy to politely ask if he wanted to sell it or not. Because there were a few different items included in this auction &amp; he may have bought it to get another item. 

Anyways... i looked up the bidding history &amp; i now see that they censor the name of the bidders. SO I am wondering if there is a different way I dont know about.",2,0,2011-05-15,EBAY,0.04255200922489166,0.9297407269477844,0.02770724892616272

Ebay,"What is eBay's policy on refunding the buyer, me, on misrepresented listings? Details in comments.","I purchase toner for my Samsung printer usually on eBay.  It is a whole lot cheaper then retail stores.  I have been doing it this way for years.  I only purchase OEM, Samsung toner.  Not the aftermarket or compatible toners.  I purchase from a seller that lists the item as OEM and manufacture is Samsung.  The only places it say compatible, is where it lists what OEM Samsung printers it works for.  For example: it is compatible with Samsung printers 123x, 123y, 123z.  Other the that it says OEM.

I contacted the seller as soon as I received the ""compatible"" toner.  He said to ship it back to him for a refund...but we have to pay the shipping.  Florida to California is not cheap.  I would not mind paying for the shipping if it was defective or damaged, but it was misrepresented in the listing.  He said, all sales are final and you bought it.  I again pointed out you had it listed as an OEM toner, not as a ""compatible"" toner.  Once again, not my problem you bought it.

I contacted eBay and they said we have 7 days to work it out before eBay will rule on it.  I am in the 7 days, now.  The seller has offered to refund me, but I still have to pay for the shipping.  I again contacted eBay and they said I, the buyer, would have to pay return shipping even though the item was not sent as described.

Am I missing something here?  I thought eBay protected the buyer from misrepresented listings. NOTE: this is **not** one of the listings like: This is just the ""box"" of a toner not the actual toner.  The seller listed and sold X and sent Y and eBay says to get a refund I have to send back Y at my expense.

TLDR: eBay seller sold me X sent me Y and it is my fault.  eBay says **I** have to pay to get it fixed.",6,0,2011-05-17,EBAY,0.061290569603443146,0.9023692011833191,0.03634022921323776
Ebay,Ebay changes UI.

Ebay,Why bid on an item 2 days before it ends?,"Does any buyer actually bid so early thinking that they're going to win the auction?

It just drives up prices for buyers far too early which could then be detrimental to sellers too because people are then put off by the early high price and stop watching it, but if it was the last 10 minutes of an auction and the item was around the same price as before they start having a bidding war.",12,7,2011-05-19,EBAY,0.06701048463582993,0.8888350129127502,0.04415445774793625
Ebay,"Bought laptop off ebay - not as described. Advice, please?","I recently (read: two days ago) purchased an HP 2133 from a seller on eBay which I received today. My main reason for purchasing was a) I won it reasonable cheap and b) it has a much higher resolution screen than most other netbooks. 

After receiving the package today, I opened it and booted it. The seller had obviously reinstalled Vista Business which would have come with the netbook and I simply presumed he had just not installed the video drivers. Since installing all the drivers needed, it appears that, unlike what he advertised, this is the lower resolution model with 1024x600 screen - exactly what I did not want. 

I specifically ordered the laptop due to the screen and have received one that does not have the screen described. Am I eligible for a return and a refund? I have emailed the seller asking if this is simply a shipping error but have yet to receive a reply (it hasn't been three days yet, however).

[This](http://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/e11030.m43.l1123/7?euid=5c7ec3f65ea04d9dac4619ecd8b3db15&amp;loc=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.ebay.co.uk%2Fws%2FeBayISAPI.dll%3FViewItem%26item%3D250820144441%26ssPageName%3DADME%3AB%3AEF%3AGB%3A1123) is the laptop that I purchased and you can clearly see that it is described as having a 1280x800 screen, not a 1024x768 screen. 

Sure, this could simply be a typing error, however I am sure that since it is not what I wanted I should be eligible for a refund?",11,5,2011-05-24,EBAY,0.056629929691553116,0.8918766379356384,0.051493413746356964

Ebay,New seller with some questions...,"So I've recently decided to start selling used men's clothing that I find at thrift stores on eBay.
