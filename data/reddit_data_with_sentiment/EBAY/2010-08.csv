Ebay,"Help! Ebay/Paypal account compromised, got that straightened out, but ended up with a laptop","About a month ago I got a notification from paypal and ebay that my account may have been compromised and there were unauthorized transactions. The two transactions were to Panda Global Communications, for $99 and $30. I disputed the claims, changed my passwords and got the money back in my account. 

I thought that was it until I get back to college today and see I have a package waiting for me. It's a laptop that was purchased through my eBay account (though I didn't know it at the time). I checked the seller's history and he has 0% feedback, member since 2003, and from Kansas. The package was shipped from Nebraska for what it's worth. 

So on my end I thought I had heard the last of all this a month ago. Should I contact the seller and let him know what happened? Is it possible the seller was in on this scam? Has anyone heard of anything like this happening before? I don't really ever use eBay, and I was planning on contacting them, but I figured I'd try here first.",2,2,2010-08-29,EBAY,0.04749742150306702,0.9202114343643188,0.03229109197854996
