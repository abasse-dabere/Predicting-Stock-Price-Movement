Ebay,Why doesn't eBay take their fee at the time of sale instead of once a month?,"What is the benefit of them waiting to take the month's fees at once? Wouldn't it be better for everyone for them to take the fee before it even hits PayPal?

I understand the importance of budgeting for this, but I feel like everyone would be happier if they took their fee at the time of sale. eBay would have their money at once, and sellers wouldn't have to hold money back to pay that fee once a month.

Have they ever given a reason why they do it this way?",73,72,2019-10-01,EBAY,0.0336829274892807,0.9224687814712524,0.04384836181998253

Ebay,WARNING - Serious ebay problem. Some ebay sales not being properly completed after payment is made.,"I just ran into a serious problem on eBay that both buyers and sellers should know about. And worse, eBay is not actively informing people about this.

Someone bought an item from me. They paid for it and the payment appeared in my paypal account. But the item still shows as unsold on ebay. And the item still shows as active on my seller page and does not show on my sold page.

So even though the money went through, none of the sale information was recorded on ebay. If I had not noticed the money in my paypal account, I never would have known the item sold.

Ebay's ""solution"" is for the seller to refund the money and ask the buyer to repurchase the item.

So this means if the seller does not notice the money in their paypal account, they will never know the sale happened. And it also means none of seller protections or mailing tools are available for the sale. Obviously, this could lead to some very unhappy customers.

And ebay knows this is happening. You will hear a recorded message when you call their customer service number. It is not happening on all transactions. Apparently they are working on trying to fix it. But they are not working to correct the affected sales nor are they actively letting people know when this has happened.",33,22,2019-10-01,EBAY,0.07615504413843155,0.8919212818145752,0.03192370757460594
Ebay,Ebay charged me for a support phone call?,"Title says it all. Just now I noticed a charge from Ebay support for $9.50 from out of my paypal account.

Ebay,"Twice yesterday someone bought an item, paid via paypal, and paypal shows I have the money. But ebay shows no signs of the items being sold. Separate buyers, both reached out to me asking what is going on.","I have records of payments with transaction numbers and everything you would expect in paypal for a sale on ebay. But nothing about the sales on ebay, and the items are still listed as if they did not sell.

These are not big expensive items that I'd expect a cheater to try to get for free. They aren't ipads or something that someone could turn around fast. Both buyers have very good feedback. It feels like a glitch.

Both were purchased yesterday at about the same time. I've had other orders go through just fine before and after these two (but no sales in between those two). I have not signed up for managed payments yet, these were sold via paypal.

Any idea what is going on? One buyer requested a refund so I sent it. The other just emailed me asking what is going on. I said I would refund or just ship it, whichever they choose. Since I have the paypal record, I can ship from there, and I don't see any reason why shipping it would be a problem as long as I have the tracking info showing it got there. I don't really suspect the buyer is dishonest, since the exact same thing happened to a different buyer at nearly the same time. Any good reason I shouldn't just ship it if that's what they want?

Ebay,Advice on communicating with a seller who is not a native English speaker.,"I recently bought a retro gaming controller from a seller in Japan.

The order arrived quickly and is working well.

The trouble is that the seller accidentally included additional items in the box: 10 game cartridges and another (different) controller.

I've contacted the seller to let them know their mistake and offered to send back the items I didn't pay for, if they agree to cover shipping. I included a picture of the items that I didn't pay for.

By their response, it's clear that they don't understand my message. 

I feel bad because the listing showed they had several of these to sell and I think they might have sent me someone else's multi-item order. If true, I would hate to be the other buyer, in this situation.

Does eBay have a mechanism for assisting with language issues?

Has something like this happened before?

To be clear, I'm very happy with the item I ordered. I provided positive feedback on the transaction to eBay.

Just trying to do the right thing. Would appreciate any advice.

**Edit: After some back and forth, the seller seems to understand the issue.**

**Edit 2: The seller eventually sent me funds to cover return shipping. The items are on their way back to Japan.**",5,5,2019-10-02,EBAY,0.16318060457706451,0.7911630868911743,0.045656293630599976

Ebay,First Time Ebay Seller and Buyer Claims Genuine Handbag Received is Counterfeit,"Hi all, I'm a first time seller and poster on r/Ebay and I hope I am on the correct forum. Apologies if any rules are broken but I am currently unsure of what to do. I recently created an Ebay account less than two months ago in hopes of selling some of my items that I no longer need. A couple weeks ago, I received an offer for a brand name handbag, received payment from the buyer and promptly shipped it with the tracking number. The buyer has a very positive rating as a buyer and seller, and has been on Ebay for more than a decade, and so I was excited to make my very first sell on Ebay. A few hours after the buyer received the item, he claimed that my handbag was a counterfeit, even though it is authentic.  He continued to say that the item was indeed counterfeit since he allegedly  verified with the original store that it was a fake and ""did not match the original product"" (I took the pictures of the original item myself and filmed myself packing the bag to be shipped). I've read that Ebay usually sides with the buyer even if their claims are false and this kind of situation happens more frequently due to my no return policy. What should my next steps be? I would be willing to refund the buyer his money, IF i receive my item back in the same condition as it was before, but now I'm scared that he might send back a fake/emptybox/damaged item.",15,3,2019-10-02,EBAY,0.08909159153699875,0.8783581852912903,0.03255020081996918

* You're buying an item sold in a currency that is not supported""

Ebay,This Sub is Toxic.,"I've been a lurker and sometimes frequent contributor to this sub for about six months (and an active eBay buyer and seller for more than 15 years). I've found almost zero thoughtful dialogue happening here. The prevailing vibe here is a blend of underachievement and toxicity that really rears its head if one dares suggest an eBay seller might be acting in appropriately or at fault in any situation \[Gasp!\].  

95% of the posts here are people bitching or asking questions they could find the answer to with about four seconds of googling (and in the case of the guy who claimed eBay's CEO was running the company into the ground because he was Jewish the other day, it's also anti-semitic ; bonus!) . I imagine if one were to look at the top ten most popular posts from five years ago, they would be almost identical to the ones you find here today. 

As near as I can tell, there are the two fundamental tenets one must adhere to in order to be accepted here, perhaps they could be added to the sub's captioning at the upper right to help educate new arrivals:

1. Everything is a scam and everyone is trying to scam you. Block them.

Ebay,PSA: FedEx has carte blanche with shipping charges and disputes,"I'm sure many of you already know this, but I wanted to provide some information after a frustrating back and forth about a clearly erroneous FedEx charge (a second shipping charge, with a broken tracking number, levied three months after the item was shipped and two months after the actual shipping label charge was settled with eBay).

Basically, if you ship via FedEx using eBay, the FedEx can charge eBay whatever it wants, without any need to justify the charges levied or respond to inquiries from eBay. They can bill you at minimum more than three months after the relevant item is sold.

FedEx will automatically decline any dispute filed by eBay, without any explanation, even if the case is 100% ironclad.

eBay signed some sort of agreement that does not allow them to escalate disputes or speak to a human being at FedEx. They can only email. There is no minimum response time from FedEx. Presumably, FedEx can simply not respond.

Since eBay automatically passes all charges on, they suffer no losses and have no incentive to help.

At that point, eBay will tell you to talk to FedEx. FedEx will say they can only talk to eBay.

(Rant over.)

Take away: Be sure to check your invoices carefully. There might be completely phantom FedEx charges for items you already shipped and paid shipping fees for.",5,3,2019-10-04,EBAY,0.11055789887905121,0.8630139827728271,0.02642807923257351

Ebay,Paid to ship a large package priority and the seller sent it ground,"I'm on the west coast and I bought an item from a seller on the east coast. The package was 28x28x12"" and 20 pounds and the only shipping option was priority mail at $120, which I paid. The seller sent the package FedEx Ground and going by the the Fitshipper calculator the cost of the label was actually around $58. However, they had a lengthy handling time so even though I technically paid for expedited shipping and they sent it ground it still arrived within the shipping estimate.

I have not contacted the seller yet but I'm not happy that they have basically pocketed $60 off the shipping switch and I paid for a service I didn't get.

From my experiance lurking on this sub, I have learned that this is most likely a scam. What should I do? 

Should I message the buyer saying to change the address on his eBay account? If that's the case, do I just send it to him if he does change it?

Should I open a case with eBay about it?

Update Edit: I messaged the buyer saying he would need to cancel it and I could relist it because of the different address. 

He came back and said, ""If thats the case, lets just go ahead and send it to the listed address and I can go pick it up. I’m friends with the new residents at the old address so it shouldnt be a problem.""

Ebay,"Weird situation, buyer doesn't know they already bought an item from me, any advise?","I cancelled an item because it had flaws that I failed to describe (I'm usually more careful). I waited 3 days for them to reply if they still wanted it and messaged them at least once a day and they didn't reply. And of course after I cancelled they replied saying they still wanted it. I deleted the old listing, and I'm thinking now I shouldn't have done that. I had to make a new listing for it because of that and ebay suggested a different category then what I had the old one in and I used new photos and slightly different title. I told them it's for sale again but I had to make new listing for it, and they bought it again. But now I got a message from them saying they can't find the new listing for it. I want to tell them they already bought it from me again but I'm scared of how they'll react. I'm probably overthinking it, but I have problems with anxiety. This year has been really bad for me regarding anxiety and I was close to quitting selling on ebay because my anxiety was so bad. Even though I've done it for like 9 years. And I messed up a few times on listings this year by missing details and etc. Which pretty much never happens to me so that didn't help my anxiety. So what should I do? I don't want to ignore them but I'm scared of how they might react. The last thing I need is something to set off my anxiety even more. Should I tell them something to the effect of, ""You already bought it from me again but must not have known that was my new listing?"" Or something shorter like, ""I'm sorry but it already sold."" Which is true but not the full story. Or the last thing I'd want to do which is ignore them. Yeah it's really rude to ignore but again there's my anxiety. I'm leaning toward the first option, because it's the most honest. I'm sorry if I sound pathetic or something for even asking, but sometimes it helps me to talk about a situation, especially with having anxiety. I already feel better just having typed this out. 

TL;DR Cancelled an order because buyer didn't say if they still wanted it after I discovered flaws, they still wanted it. I made a whole new listing for it, they bought it again, but then said they can't find the new listing. I'm scared of telling them they already bought it again, my anxiety has been really bad this year.

Ebay,How to deal with this buyer.,"Ok so I have this problem with  at first what I like to call a ""demanding buyer"" that's kinda snowballed on me. 

It all started when I sold the item Sunday on Tuesday he messages me why I haven't shipped yet. In Message he tells me he sent a message when he paid asking for expedited shipping  and express handling (I check both ebay and PP there is no message). But fine 


I reply with message saying I found no earlier message from him but item will get this shipped same day I received his message and send it expedited shipping ( at no addition cost)  I was going to anyways just a day or 2 later so whatever.  ( I always unrated my own shipping service that way people can't complain)



Then a week later he messages me saying that the item won't charge (it's a laptop) he says he thinks the charger is bad wants money for a new one. I tell him the whole item is probably just defective and to open a return and I'll refund.


 I got a decent price on the item not crazy cheap but decent deal  I could probably get a little more for it enough to cover the return  cost at least so I had no problem giving him a return and why I thought he wouldn't return it. But he agreed and had seem to have no trouble accepting it.


Now the buyer is telling me he  only send back the old charger and wants the money for a new charger (40$) plus he says the item still doesn't work and wants me to pay and extra 60$ for ""diagnose and fix."" from his  tech. 


Not sure how to deal with this guy. Also not sure what happens with ebay case. On the one hand he's sent back ""a package"" with prepaid label on the other he admits he didn't sent back the item and is still trying for the partial only now it's more. Will ebay still try to force me to refund?

Ebay,Super needy buyer and tracking that never updated,"I printed a label last Thursday and got this item into the mail on Friday, but the tracking never updated, so it still just says ""label created"". I'm assuming it was never actually scanned. It's priority mail so it should take 2 to 4 business days, it's been 3 so far. 

Saturday morning when the tracking didn't update he emailed me asking about it. I told him it was strange but I had definitely mailed it, he has contacted me since then twice a day asking me where it is. This morning, he just sent ""WHERE IS MY PURCHASE"".

Ebay,"Selling: Buyer asked for a return, has ignored my message. Now eBay says my response is overdue.","Hi there,

A bit confused and hoping someone might be able to shed some light.

A buyer is asking for a return that I don't feel they are entitled to, so I sent them a message explaining my position and giving them a way to get technical support from the item they purchased.

I sent that message on the same day they opened the return request.

Now, eBay is saying I am overdue in responding.

Does eBay. not consider an unanswered message sent using the return request screen to be a response?

My understanding is that if I open a case I'm basically asking eBay to find in the buyer's favor and ding my account, so I'm not excited about that.

Ebay,Why is eBay still ignoring user's shipping preference when seller list items? (aka how GSP lost about $250),"This one bit GSP's ass to the tune of almost $250 because they ignored my listing's USA only shipping and ninja-enabled GSP option.

I had a sealed software box that was labeled not for export because it contained property code (I think?) for encryption and when I listed it, I made sure the description stated ""USA only, not for export"" and the shipping section was for USA only, no international shipping. I checked after I listed to be sure, and it was still USA only.

Last week it sold and I noticed it was addressed to well known GSP address in KY. 

I decided to feign ignorance of the receiving address and I printed out a copy of the description with the not for export highlighted. And included a short letter ""If you bought this for use in USA, thank you! Be sure to leave me feedback afterward. If you bought this to ship to a friend or relative oversea, be aware this box is labeled not for export, it may be intercepted and refused/returned to USA or destroyed by customs.""

I got notification that buyer was refunded 100% and that I don't need to do anything.

So eBay: why do you still ninja-enable GSP on listing made with any form other than the standard ""expert only"" item listing?  If you're going to do it anyway, least don't be lazy and add in a check for ""not for export"" disclaimer.",12,8,2019-10-10,EBAY,0.04045816883444786,0.9241533279418945,0.03538849204778671

I called eBay and they said it was because it's a GSP transaction, and the buyer has to pay customs fees to get the item into the country.

My free shipping will get the item to Erlanger Kentucky, but that's it.

He then says that he wants me to help him troubleshoot it so I do that. It turns out he's got the wrong versiom of motherboard, so I advise him as how best to fix it and that was the end of it.

...at least it was for a short while. This guy then sends me another message a while later saying that he tried it on a friend's computer and it didn't work. He lists the motherboard that he used and low and behold it was another incompatible motherboard!

I notify him of this and not hear back from him for another while until he claims that he's then given it to the computer shop and they have determined that it's faulty, which it very well could be at this point, but it wouldn't have been because of me.

So I get it back yesterday and absolutely nothing is wrong with it. It's not broke in any way, shape, or form, and the color is exactly what was shown in the picture.

I believe there is a return option for people who bought something, and just realize they don't want it or need it?

I realized after my reply that the Unpaid Item case had already opened exactly 50 minutes prior to the buyer's message. For the record, I would have canceled the order if he asked before the Unpaid Item case opened, but I wouldn't have offered because this kind of behavior deserves a strike. If the buyer is genuinely that deluded about how ebay works, they can take it as a learning experience since one strike won't affect their account.

Ebay,Sorry but I just have to rant about the idiots I've encountered this weekend,"To start with let me say it's Canadian Thanksgiving &amp; my listings show I'm away until Oct 15th.

#1- Sends an offer Friday night.  I accepted about an hour later.  They send a cancellation request.  I ask why.  They bought one on Amazon because they didn't know when I would respond.  I point out it was very clear  when they made the offer a seller has 48 hours &amp; they're committed to the purchase in that time, etc.
Then says they'll just pay &amp; leave me negative feedback 🙄 

#2- they're in Germany.  Send offer Friday night at like 2am (Saturday morning).  An hour later they retracted the offer. 🤷‍♀️
But then they did they the same thing again last night so I got curious &amp; asked why they keep doing that
""Because you didn't reply""
Acts like a dick about it too telling me how they went elsewhere as if I care lol.

#3- buyer in South Africa send a low offer yesterday on an oversized item.  EBay shows they're using a US address &amp; I've had the item listed for awhile now with no interest so I accepted.
This morning they ask if it's cheaper for me to ship it to an address in Canada.  I point out my listing description couldn't be more clear- Canada &amp; US $15, and the international counties I can ship to $35.  
The tell me they'll just pay &amp; I can look for a cheaper shipping option &amp; refund them the difference so I explain in more details that I only ship with tracking according to ebay policy, I told her the weight of the package &amp; told her she's welcome to verify shipping costs with Canada Post.
She pays then again tells me to find something else &amp; refund her the difference 😕

Ebay,Another buyer wants to cancel AFTER the unpaid item case opened automatically.,"Buyer: 

&gt;Hey I don’t want the shoes, so can you cancel the order. Sorry for the inconvenience

Me:

&gt;I'm sorry, once an unpaid item case is open, the order can no longer be canceled. Since you no longer want the order, you can just wait until the case closes automatically after 6 days of nonpayment.

&gt;Please view ebay's Offer Policy and Payment Policy for more information.

Buyer:

&gt;It literally says that I can contact you to cancel the case or close it

Me:

&gt;I'm sorry for the confusion. Yes, ebay recommends contacting a seller to cancel an order, however, this is only applicable within the first 2 days before the Unpaid Item Assistant automatically opens a case - as mentioned in our store policies at the bottom of the listing. Due to the way the system is programmed, the only ways to close an unpaid case are 1) receive payment and ship, and 2) wait for 6 days to pass unpaid. Since you are a new buyer, the Unpaid Strike should not affect you, but remember in the future that an offer is considered a committment to buy according to ebay policy.

&gt;If you have any other concerns, I recommend calling customer support for further explanation.


Note: buyer has just 8 feedback and we accepted his $100 offer on a $140 listing.

The recent influx of ""Oh, you want me to pay? I don't want it anymore, cancel it"" buyers is getting annoying again.

i have done no such thing and never even communicated with seller at any point in time.

i only started using ebay again in recent years, i remember that back in 2006 when a seller cancelled the order it is simply cancelled, simple as that. but nowadays it seems sellers have to give ebay a valid reason to do so and the reason the seller gave was that ""buyer has requested to cancel the order"" which is not true.

will this affect my ebay account in any way? like with something similiar to an unpaid item strike or something?

When I first started selling, I put a lot of very random vintage items up for sale. 

If an item didn't sell for a month or so with very low view counts, no interest, etc. I would just take them down.

That was a bad idea. 

I received a promotion for 50 free listings so decided to take a look at my unsold items and put some back up for sale. 

One of my least viewed items (not seasonal or anything) that sat without getting a single bid for *6 weeks* just sold for 3x the starting bid. 

I've also seen many items sit with no interest (no views, watchers, or messages) for over a month and then sell. 

Be patient. It will sell.

Buyer was competing with another bidder and won the auction . Drove from FL to MO with a minivan that wasn’t even close to being able to pull it .

Today I see a open PayPal case for “item not received “ , and called to see what could be done . It’s my understanding that titled items such as vehicles and campers are not covered under buyer protection and if he didn’t complete the transaction , he’s out of luck . PayPal told me that no action would be taken for 10 days to give us time to “work it out” and that I needed to respond in the resolution center , which I did , and explained that buyer remorse was not a valid refund reason . We encourage and welcome pre purchase inspections , by either a potential bidder or a third party . He chose to do neither . I have zero inclination to return his deposit, as he cost me lost sales opportunity , and forced it to remain on my lot an additional 3 weeks until a found a real buyer who was head over heels in love with it .

Ebay,EBay flags buyer as 'Suspicious' - still tells me to send item,"Yesterday I sell an item to a new account (2 feedback) and shortly after get a message from eBay saying the buyer is suspicious and gives me the following instructions:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; We recommend you take the following actions if this buyer won the item:  
\- If you haven't received payment, don't complete the sale or send the item to the buyer.  
\- Don't communicate with the buyer directly.  
\- Verify any payments you've been notified of by logging into your payment account (or other online payment service).  
\- If the buyer requests a refund or additional payments, don't send any money without contacting eBay first.  
\- If you've already sent the item, try contacting the shipping carrier to find out if you can stop shipment. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I have the buyer's money in my PayPal account and the order sitting in my Awaiting Shipment list.  EBay deleted MY listing, but didn't cancel the transaction.   I don't have an item number anymore.  It's now very unclear what eBay actually wants me to do.  Per their instructions I shouldn't ship the item, message the buyer, or refund the buyer.  I call eBay, they tell me to cancel the order and refund the buyer.  No big deal.  I have to retype the listing instead of 'relisting' because eBay completely wiped the listing.  Up to this point just a minor annoyance - about a half hour of time and PayPal fees.

&amp;#x200B;

Come today the exact same buyer purchases my freshly relisted item.  New account (a couple extra #'s), same name, same address, same PayPal account.  I call eBay again.  They acknowledge it is the same person, that the previous account was suspended and this person just created another new account.  After my call gets transferred from Mumbai to Bengaluru to New Dehli the eBay rep comes to a conclusion.  Even though the new account this person was using yesterday was suspended, the new account they are using today *isn't* therefore I should still send the item.  I'm dumbfounded how they could ask me to sell the same item to the same person that they prevented me from selling to yesterday.  The rep tells me the previous account (2 feedback, 0 selling) was suspended for selling activity not buying activity.  She also tells me not to message the buyer.  

&amp;#x200B;

I tell the rep I'm not comfortable selling to a brand new account knowing that the user was just suspended from eBay yesterday.  She then tells me I can message the buyer if I plan on canceling the order.  It's a TRS order (free shipping, returns) so I'm not in any hurry to eat the cost of shipping both ways.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the way I'm going to handle this is to message the buyer that I can't process the order, because their account was flagged as suspicious by eBay.  Then cancel the order by saying ""problem with the buyer's address"" to try to avoid the defect.  Is this the best way to handle this?

Some listings from a business say specifically they charge tax so I'm ok with being charged tax from a business but this was from someone who has sold 1 item in 10 years (from his review) so hardly a business.   

Now I'm looking at the frame which could be 2k and I want to know which states (seller's residence) charge a tax.

Ebay,What's the strangest thing you've ever sold on eBay?,"I recall a time many many years ago (I was in my late teens or early 20s) when selling the Monopoly game pieces from McDonald's on eBay was a ***huge*** thing. At one point, I wanted to jump on that bandwagon, but didn't have any pieces of real value. With that in mind, I decided to cut out a piece of the paper Monopoly board to which one would normally stick their pieces. I can't remember which space it was, but I remember it was one of the red spaces. It was whichever one was next to impossible to find. I clearly stated in my listing that it was a cutout from the board, not an actual game piece, and held no value, but other than that one line and the photo, the rest of my listing was actually quite misleading if the buyer chose not read it. This was not a very smart idea looking back, but I went with it anyways.  
  
I listed this as a 7-day auction, and to my surprise, a bidding war ensued. By the time the auction ended, I believe it ended at $137+, which I thought was pretty awesome. I was, however, a bit worried about how the buyer would react upon receiving the cutout, since they literally just bought a worthless piece of paper. I was hilariously ecstatic, though, when I received a message from the buyer the day it was delivered along with positive feedback for the item. In the message, he/she stated that it was *exactly* the piece that they were missing, and included a photo of their paper Monopoly board with that space cut out and the piece I sent them placed just below it.  
  
I really wish I had saved that message, but I'm pretty sure it was in one of my old eBay accounts. :-(

Ebay,Buyer claiming robotic vacuum is defective because it doesn’t support 5G WiFi band,"Sold a Roborock robotic vacuum. This model even has its own eBay catalog. One buyer opened a case and said she wanted to return because it doesn’t support 5G WiFi. I told her the specifications are listed on their website and she should have done her own research. Plus, lots of smart home products only support 2G network. I gave her some examples like my Sonos speaker.

Her router should have a 2G network, that’s the default one for router. Told her that, it’s easy as a few clicks but she didn’t budge.

Since I dropshipped this item from Amazon, somehow she got a return label from Amazon from them (presumably from the tracking number) and sent it back to Amazon. I received a refund notification from Amazon but no updates from eBay. Then a few days later, the case was closed in her favor.

Then.. I called to complain and for the first time, a rep agreed with me and said she didn’t ship the item back to my own return address, but to Amazon, so she reversed the decision. I got to keep the money from the buyer.

Ebay,Has this seller done me wrong or am I to blame?,"I ordered an item for $25.50. I got an email saying it was shipped. Four days later I got another email that said in the subject line it was my ""Invoice for eBay purchases"" and listed the item with a big yellow ""Pay Now"" button right at the top of the email.

I was confused, and on the road home from a vacation, and so I hit the button and paid it. I was afraid I may have not paid it the first time, knew I had already received an email that it was in transit, and didn't want to short the seller.

A few days later I received it in the mail. A few more days later I received another. I contacted the seller and told him what happened and he said he never sent a second invoice and that I obviously had gone to the website and ordered another.

I hit the return button, and it was accepted, and he continued a terse communication which he basically said I had ordered two and it was impossible that this mistake occured the way I said. I offered to send him the emails, and he went silent.

After he received it I got the refund from him. It was $5 short. It said ""item deduction"" and that was $5. I asked him why he partially refunded me and he said only that he refunded me my money. No explanation, he never told me it was gonna be a partial refund. And he won't respond as to why.

What happened? Is he allowed to do this? How do I proceed? I want my $5 back. I did not mean to buy two items, I simply wanted to make sure I paid for what I owed before it arrived. I was trying to do the right thing and it cost me $5. What can I do next? Am I wrong? What is this deduction? Can anyone help me with this?

EDIT : spelling

UPDATE: The seller stopped communicating and so I called eBay. They issued me the discrepancy of $5 and closed the case. They had no explanation as to why I got sent an invoice from eBay for an item I had already paid for and had been shipped.

So I got my money back but I'm not satisfied. It wasn't about the money. It was about how I got mislead, probably not on purpose, how to make sure it never happens again, and about how the seller treated me with disbelief and contempt.

Ebay,"A workaround for nonrefundable PayPal fees - an eBay-legal pseudo ""restocking"" fee","We've had a lot more returns this past month than usual, and I estimate it's cost us close to $100 (counting shipping and PayPal fees) so it was time to reevaluate our policies to save some money.

(OLD) Shipping: Free USPS Priority. Built into out BIN price. Must be refunded in the event of a return. Easier to list without pre packaging for accurate weight and dimensions.

Returns: Free within 30 days. Along with 1-day handling, lets us keep the TRS badge and related discounts.

We decided to keep our return policy - only for the TRS benefits - and implement a new shipping policy, effective immediately on all new listings, and to be added to all previous listings over time.

(NEW) Shipping: Calculated USPS Priority. Can be kept for all remorse returns. Requires semi-accurate package dimensions prior to listing.

(NEW) Handling: Can only be added to calculated shipping. Does not need to be refunded for remorse returns. $5 extra, covers shipping supplies and PayPal fees on our average sale.

This may seem expensive for the customer at first glance, but our plan is to reduce BIN prices by the total zone 8 S&amp;H cost and no longer factor distance into offers. Only customers who make remorse returns will be affected, as the total price will remain unchanged, or potentially be lower for buyers in closer shipping zones.

Basically, the handling fee acts as a built-in and *reasonable* restocking fee (i.e. $5 rather than an outrageous 50%) to cover no more than lost fees and visibility.",13,14,2019-10-21,EBAY,0.050233133137226105,0.9086746573448181,0.04109220206737518
Ebay,Purchased an UNAUTHENTIC ITEM,"Hi All - Wish I found you sooner.

Not an avid Ebay user, but have bought multiple items over the years without any issue.

I have reached out to the seller asking for a refund (they don't accept refunds) but what else can I do? I obviously want a refund, but if I feel like rather than actually returning it I should destroy it.

What is the best course of action to get a refund?

I see that the seller has 3 days to respond before I can connect with Ebay.

Ebay,Anyone else over all of Ebays technical issues and moving to other platforms?,"This weeks latest issue of messing with the items specifics has really affected my account and my sales have plummeted.

Ebays reason for this is they have add a whole bunch of new item specifics fields that are now what the filters use but not migrated any of the original data I entered over to the new specifics fields.

This is such a basic data migration job that there really isn't any excuse for it. It's not a complicated data migration job other than the sheer volume of data they would have had to migrate. If I had fucked this up in work I would be fired on the spot so I dont understand how ebay couldn't handle just a basic job.

Ebay,Buyer wanting refund,"Hi there.

I'm a somewhat new eBay seller and I shipped a package worth about $600 (CAD) to a Vietnamese buyer about a month and a half ago (Early-mid Sept).

Although the non-expedited tracking option stated it'd arrive by around Oct. 9, I was informed by Canada Post that it would take around 2-3 months and I informed the buyer that it would take around that long before I shipped it out, and they just replied with ""ok"".

I included a tracking number along with it [https://i.imgur.com/xRrorNs.png](https://i.imgur.com/xRrorNs.png) so I do have proof I sent it out. Shipping with tracking actually cost me around $120 when the buyer only paid $60 (had to cover the rest myself, shipping expedited would have been around $250 according to the person working at the post office)

Just today they opened a refund request, and I resent the tracking number and just politely explained again that shipping to Vietnam takes 2-3 months. Waiting on a reply but I have bad anxiety so I'm just wondering if anyone has had the same experience and if so how did you go about solving it?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT\*\* Phoned Canada Post, lady said it's no longer in the country so there's no chance of redirecting it back to my address.Kinda at a standstill now.

Ebay,Blocked bidder plans to tattle on me to eBay management,"I’ve been selling on eBay about 19 years.  My bbl has been in effect a long time.  Lots of ids are on it.  I don’t necessarily remember why I put someone there, but if they’re there, I trust that I put them there for a good reason and they’re there to stay.  

Just got a message from someone asking why she can’t bid.   I checked her feedback left for others and saw that shes left lots of neutrals a d negs for sellers.  She had left a neutral simply thanking a seller for a refund.  If his  response to her feedback is to be believed, she claimed the item was defective, he let her keep it and refunded her money in full, and she in turn neutrals him,  thanking him for the refund!

I responded that she couldn’t bid because she was on my bbl.  that I didn’t recall why I’d added her to it, but that her feedback left for others indicated she has lots of problems buying on eBay.  I also said I thought it was terrible that she had neutral’d a seller who let her keep an item and refunded her in full.  

Boy oh boy did that ever piss off Karen.  She got up on her high horse and told me the seller had “deceived” her by putting misleading photos in the listing.   That the item she purchased was “defective”. (This is not mentioned in the feedback she left!).  

She then ends her message with this:

“There is something really wrong here.  I will get in touch with eBay.  I have met with their entire management staff, they value my feedback, and they need to understand what’s happening here.   And you can quote me on any of this.  The entire email string is here for all to see. “

Gee Karen thanks for the veiled threat that you’re going to sic eBay management on me for blocking you.  Just showed me that I made the right decision in blocking you!

I responded that eBay themselves created the blocked bidders list for sellers to use.  That eBay does not force sellers to conduct business with everyone.  That sellers are allowed to place anyone they choose on their bbl, at any time, for any reason.  And that she was welcome to ask eBay to “investigate” my decision not to do business with her.

Ebay,"I’ve just received a returned package that never made it to the buyer, buyer doesn’t even seem to realise he hasn’t received his item?","Hi all,

I’m looking for some advice in regards to a recent sale. The sale took place on Depop but they’re subreddit is much smaller than here so I figured this was a better place for me to post. 

So, I’ve been selling on depop and eBay (UK) quite a bit over the past year, I always include a return address on all my parcels just in case they get lost, don’t make it to the buyer etc.

Just over a month ago I shipped out a pair of trainers, the buyer bought it without messaging but that’s fine and happens a good amount. I messaged them to say I would be shipping soon, then I marked it as shipped. I left the buyer a positive review shortly after and as far as I was concerned the sale was sorted. 
Fast forward 4 and a half weeks to today, when I receive none other than that same package in the post. There’s a little sticker on it saying the buyer was away and never collected the parcel from the post office on their end. This really baffles me as you’d think a buyer who’s just spent £30+ on an item would be messaging me asking where the hell the item is, but this guy hadn’t messaged me once. I’ve checked their depop account and it seems they are not active. 

I’m a bit torn on what to do and looking for some extra opinions. Shall I just refund him? Shall I ship it back out, or message him and ask what’s happening despite the fact he’s not active, or shall I even just keep the money until he gets back to me with what he’d like to do, which may be never. 

Any opinions appreciated. I’m somewhat worried he’ll try and blame me for not posting the package and trying to rip him off or something, but I’m curious to see how it pans out.

EDIT:
Thanks for all the responses. I’m going to put the package aside, if the buyer does not message me within 90 days I’ll re sell the item to someone else",16,4,2019-10-22,EBAY,0.0444880947470665,0.9108403325080872,0.04467152804136276

I assumed I would get a black one but sadly a white one arrived. I would be happy with a partial refund or exchanging it for a black one, but paying full price for the white one isn’t ideal.

Ebay,My biggest issue with Best Offers: Noncommittal,"It happens on occasion, and it bugs me. What I'm talking about is when you receive an offer, and accept it, or the buyer accepts your counteroffer. Then when it comes time to pay, they don't. They almost always do, but sometimes they don't. It's a waste of time, even moreso if you've only got one of that particular item, and have to relist it. That's days, or more, gone by where you could've sold it to someone else who actually would pay. It could even mean a missed sale because your item was no longer available for purchase.  
  
What bothers me even more than that is what happened today. A buyer submitted a low-ball offer for an item, I countered about $100 higher. Them, much to my surprise, they countered at about $10 lower than my counter, which was within my range to agree to sell. I accepted their counter, so the item sold, and was simply waiting for payment. That was yesterday. Today I sent a friendly payment reminder, as it has been over 24 hours since I accepted their offer (normally I'd have just waited it out, but I'm traveling this weekend, and wouldn't be able to send it out until Tuesday if they paid over weekend), to which they replied with questions about the product to see if it would suit their needs, and it's seeming as though it won't based on the questions they've asked. Not to mention that the questions they've asked could've been answered if they had read the listing description. SMH  
  
PSA To all eBay buyers out there: If there's an item you're interested in, ask any necessary questions ***before*** you are committed to buying that item.

Ebay,My favorite 'buyers be stupid' stories of the week.,"It's been a week...

1. Buyer sends me message: ""Does this engine run?""... Title of listing is ""Running Engine from \_\_\_\_"". Condition says ""running"". Description says ""running."" Description includes links to two videos showing the engine running.
2. Buyer sends me message: ""The item arrived damaged, it has a small crack in the lens."" Title of listing is ""\_\_\_\_ with small crack in lens"". Condition says ""Lens has small crack in center: See Photos"". Description says ""There is a small crack in the center of the lens: see photos"". Photos show crack clearly... with a big red arrow pointing at the crack.
3. Buyer says ""I want to have this item painted. Does it have ANY imperfections?"" Buyer goes on to note they're a ""professional"" who ""knows what they're talking about."" Item is listed as ""used."" Item is 40+ years old. *Item is flexible plastic on which paint would instantly crack and fail*. Item title, condition, photos and description note scrapes and scratches.
4. Buyer says ""Does this have ANY flaws or imperfections? Scratches, scuffs, etc?""... Title says ""\_\_\_\_\_ with scratches"". Condition says ""30+ year old item has scratches, cracks and scuffs"". Same repeated in description &amp; shown in photos.
5. Buyer says ""Will this fit my '02 \_\_\_\_\_?"" Title says ""88-94 \_\_\_\_"" Condition says ""fits 88-94 \_\_\_\_\_"". Description repeats that. Compatibility is selected for '88 - '94 models.
6. Buyer says ""Do you guarantee this item has absolutely no wear or tear and is like new?""... Item is listed as 'used'. Condition says ""Has typical wear &amp; ageing: see photos"". Description says ""Has typical wear &amp; ageing including scratches, scuffs and cracks: see photos."" Photos show typical ageing...

Ebay,eBay is clearly muddling with visibility,"There is most certainly some sort of secret society type code in there with this.  I've sold online for 20 of the past 21 years and am pretty good at pattern recognition. There's something different than there used to be here for sure, even if they won't admit it. 

I recently spoke to eBay about this and they ""refreshed"" my store... something I found out that I can do myself.  It didn't change too much, though. Numerous reps have denied what I see, though they may not be aware themselves.

Patterns I've noticed:

\- I seem to have ""sales windows"", though the time and day seems to shift. Mine started on Friday afternoons, so I figured that was a ""people just got paid"" thing... but then it switched to Mondays. Then Wednesdays. It's now seemingly Thursday nights. During those windows I'll have a lot of sales and offers. Starts suddenly... then stops suddenly.

\- There's a big regional tie, too. I'll go through a streak where 90 percent of my sales come from the west coast, then suddenly there's no more west coast sales for weeks, but suddenly 80 percent of my sales are to Texas. Then no more Texas but a lot of east coast at the same time. Then no more of that and suddenly we're real popular in California again. 

\- There was clearly a ""switch"" turned on for us in early August.  Last year, August was a ghost town. This year, we could hardly keep up with it. Then in mid September the ""switch"" went off. Now we're in October, which was our best month last year, and it's August-of-last-year-dead. And we're doing... nothing any different. 

What is interesting, though, is that last June we had a slight uptick in returns. Nothing major, but more than we usually get. Then July and August were dead. This year, we had a slight uptick in returns in August and September and here we are - slow slow slow.... I have to wonder if eBay is ""punishing"" us if we have a temporary uptick in return requests.

Only thing that seems to be working for me is outside eBay's direct system:  I'm promoting some items on social media and what not. And that does seem to work... probably half of the stuff I put out there sells within a week or so, sometimes right away.",25,17,2019-10-24,EBAY,0.04862060025334358,0.9108107686042786,0.04056865721940994

Ebay,"Seller cancelled my order, claims shipping cost is too high","I won an auction few days back in which the seller had shown a shipping fee of $149.99

Today the seller sent me a message that shipping is costing them more than the cost of the item ($299) and so they cancelled the order. This is surprising because I've sold the same thing on eBay last year and had to pay shipping of $89 (Fedex ground rates) so I know the seller is not being truthful about their shipping costs being too high.

That said, eBay doesn't even show me an option to leave feedback for this transaction - The order no longer shows in my purchase history and in the section that shows items awaiting feedback, this order is not shown. Do I have any options to leave feedback?

&amp;#x200B;

Update: I called eBay customer service and they told me they can't do anything. They also said I cannot leave feedback for this seller/ transaction (Which turns out to be wrong - another person commented below that its possible and I've used that now to leave feedback)

Ebay,WTF eBAY? Buyer claims product is Fake. I ask for photo evidence. eBay says no.,"**EDIT UPDATE NOV 7, 2019: PayPal responded and said they investigated (lol), and came to this resolution:
""*We've completed our review and decided in favor of your buyer. Due to the unique circumstances of this case, PayPal will refund your buyer at no cost to you. Your account will not be debited.*"" -- At least it's not out of my pocket.**

**EDIT UPDATE Nov 5, 2019: eBay sent buyer a return label anyhow. Buyer never returned item and case was close. Now the buyer made a claim through PayPal. I responded to PayPal that buyer never returned request to provide 
photo evidence of their claim, and that eBay sent the buyer a return label and they never returned it within the required time frame. Stay tuned.**

I sold a Nintendo DS game on eBay brand new, in shrink wrap packaging. I bought it for kids as a gift a couple years back (a duplicate so they could both have one), but only one was opened. So I resold the new unopened one on eBay recently for $29. Listing was sold as ""no returns.""

Buyer waits until 3 minutes before end of 30 days to make a return claim. They claim it is ""fake due to misprints and smudges on the cover art, which can happen through some 3rd party resellers"". I scratch my head and double check my photos of the item. No such smudges or misprints at all. Cover art matches the same game listings on eBay.

I ask buyer to provide images supporting this claim. They never do. Then eBay sends auto email ""you need to resolve this with your buyer"" I select the ""Ask eBay to step in and help."" So I tell eBay that I asked buyer for photo evidence of their claim but they never provided it.

I provide ebay a copy of my original receipt of the item along with photos that clearly show no such fake ""smudges and misprints"" that the buyer claims.

Within 5 minutes, eBay tell me I have to issue a refund. No evidence required. and **I** have to pay for return postage...

Dafuq? What am I? Best Buy no questions asked return policy? Don't buyers at least have to substantiate their claim?

Ebay,"Sometimes you need to call customer service more than once to get the correct answer (in this case, FOUR times)","EDIT: the title is wrong, I only called in three times :)

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to stress to everyone that all not eBay representatives will give you the correct information - but if you know the policy and know the rules, then never give up.  A quick recap of what I went through today:

Currently, I am out of town for the weekend.  There is a return which was just made available for pickup yesterday (Thursday) and the current eBay policy is that a buyer cannot escalate a return until the item has been available for pickup for 2 business days.  So this would give me until Monday at the latest to pick up the item, inspect it, and issue a refund.  Since this was a brand new item (sealed iPhone) and it was a buyer's remorse, it would likely be a partial refund due to usage.

Woke up this morning to an e-mail from eBay customer service saying that the case had been escalated and decided in favor of the buyer, since tracking showed that it was delivered.  I immediately knew that this was a mistake, and that an eBay representative had escalated this in error (should not have been possible until 2 business days had past).  Also this would give me a defect and take away my ability to give a partial refund, among other things.

For the next 2 hours, I made three phone calls to customer service, ending up having to ask to speak to a supervisor each time.  Both rep and supervisors gave me various reasons like ""it doesn't matter, you'll eventually have to refund anyway"" and ""yes, eBay made a mistake, but our tools don't allow us to correct it"" and many other excuses.  One person basically told me that policy didn't matter if a mistake was made and ""what's done is done"".

In the end, the 3rd supervisor on the 3rd call (after 2 hours) said that this could be immediately reversed, and didn't know why the other supervisors were having issues finding the solution.  When eBay makes a mistake, and it's their own policy that they are breaking, they have to make it right.  So within 5 minutes I was granted an appeal and the money was back in my account.

I'm not sure if this applied to anyone else, but this was such a big deal because my Paypal funds are not put on hold until the case is escalated.  If it's just a return request (whether accepted or not), I still have the funds in my account - it isn't deducted or placed on hold unless the buyer escalates it to a case.  So this wouldn't have been a big deal, but I had planned on using the funds this weekend and refunding on Monday, but as soon as the buyer escalated the case, the funds were immediately gone.  Not to mention that I hadn't even looked at the item yet (and tracking proved that) and I would be spending hours (literally) correcting this mistake on the phone.  And then not being able to issue a partial refund, having to deal with negative feedback (if left), getting the defect removed... etc.  But really who whole point here is that eBay has to fix their own mistakes, especially when they are as obvious as this one.

TL:DR; never give up - if 5 reps tell you ""No"" then maybe the 6th will tell you ""Yes""",10,23,2019-10-25,EBAY,0.17814554274082184,0.798690676689148,0.023163771256804466

Ebay,eBay will continue to fade and the reason is their embrace of Chinese sellers.,"You probably won't see this post because the Chinese are ruthless. They will sic their bots on this post and make sure it's downvoted out of your view. Same goes for your sales on eBay. If you compete with a Chinese seller, they're going to use eBay and Paypal return policies to attack you and drive you off eBay. They will claim trademark violations that don't exist and have your items removed by the A.I. trademark bots. Sure, you can call eBay and complain. You'll get the privilege of relisting your item and losing your XXX sold numbers and buyer feedback. PayPal might refund one chargeback fee but the others will stay and because you are just a small seller your profits will go negative.

Many people have already left the platform. Those people will tell you the Chinese sellers drove them off the platform. These Chinese sellers don't care about their feedback scores. They provide no positive customer experience, they manipulate eBay's policies without penalty and eBay loves them. They just love those Chinese sellers to death.. .And it will be their death unless they get their heads out of their ass and do something to promote quality sellers over the scammy scammy ruthless Chinese.

I've watched my sales dwindle and dwindle to where now, as a TRS I'm preparing to hang up my apron and close up shop. I've been on eBay since 1998. I maintain a 100% feedback score. I provide excellent service to my customers but my listings aren't even shown to potential buyers. They used to be, buyers had a choice of paying a little more and getting a better experience but now, they don't even see my listings because there are 9000 spammy listings from the same sellers. Listings that lie about item locations, sellers with 90% or less feedback scores. They are Chinese sellers operating out of US fulfillment centers.

The only downside I can think of right now is this item is on the ""$1 final fee"" promo from a week or so ago... So if he was to return them, i'd lose out on that once I relist.

Ebay,UK Buyer claiming 'Not Received' even though courier tracking shows 'Delivered to a Safe Place'. Question...?,"So I've just had a buyer message and say that a card was left saying the package I sent them was 'left in a safe place' at their house. Unfortunately it seems it wasn't that safe. I've already talked to eBay and they've said as far as they and PayPal are concerned, I've done my job and I'm covered because tracking shows delivered.

BUT.... I'm one of those honest types that feels terrible about this (though admittedly not terrible enough to fork out £30 of my own money to directly refund the guy). I've looked on Google Street View and in all honesty, the 'safe place' was a terrible idea. I would like to try and make a claim to help get this (presumably honest?) guy his money back. Sooo....

**TL; DR: Question: I bought a shipping label through eBay's Packlink service, and the courier company that did the delivering was Hermes. Who do I try and get in touch with about this? Packlink or Hermes? And does anyone have any tips that may help me be more successful in trying to get a refund / compensation for my buyer, as I know this is a tricky one where they may just try and say 'meh! we delivered it'?**

Ebay,Creating Motor-Parts and Accessories Fitment in Bulk,"It's a fairly specific question, but I haven't had much luck finding the answer on my own, and figured I would start asking in places like this rather than aimlessly hunting in google.  Does anybody know of programs/services that will allow quick creation and application of the parts compatibility charts when creating a listing, or bulk editing to add this information to many listings after they have already been posted? I'm talking about the lists of years, makes, and models that the part fits, that are a part of ebays search function.

What I am looking for is both things, really, but one or the other would be close enough. I'm dealing with used OE car parts, and almost none of them are in the ebay catalog, so what I need to do is create the parts compatibility files, and then apply them, the same way you would apply a template in something like Auctiva. Alternatively, if I could apply the same fitment charts to many listings at once, in bulk, that would work too.

I've tried myfitment, but it doesn't look like its going to do what I need it to. It's missing years of certain models, and I can only figure out how to get it to add fitment to 10 listings at once, which would make it take significantly too long. I've seen channeladvisor as well, but it's exceedingly expensive, and I'm still not sure if it would work the way I would like.",1,2,2019-10-27,EBAY,0.02752268686890602,0.9377586841583252,0.03471863642334938

He said that wouldn't do so can I hold it for a week and then ship.  I always ship next day and I've been dinged a couple times for shipping late (cause the PO didn't scan it till the next day) so again I had to tell him that I could not hold it but would cancel the sale if he wished.

Ebay,"Buyer returned item using their own label, case closed with a defect","1. My buyer requested a return

2. I provided a label through ebay

3. Buyer never used label, return automatically closed

4. Buyer opens case with ebay, provides tracking number for label they created

5. Case closed with refund to buyer and I get an account defect

6. I called eBay, rep says there is no way to remove the defect. I'm adamant that I never received a tracking number for the return, nothing on the box indicated which transaction I should refund or who the package was from, so I never refunded.

Ebay,"Anyone else experiencing this glitch? PayPal showing item sold, eBay isn’t","Hopefully this all makes sense. Basically, my PayPal account is showing that a customer has paid for an item in my eBay store and is showing the “NEEDS ATTENTION” flair on the payment. I checked my eBay account, however, (app and later on desktop) and it’s showing that the item is still an active listing and has not been sold. Didn’t get an email or anything saying the item has sold.

I called eBay customer service and they basically told me it’s probably just a glitch and I should just wait until it shows up as sold on my eBay account. They also said that PayPal is probably down right now but I was able to process and ship the other orders just fine. Has this ever happened to anyone before?",8,3,2019-10-30,EBAY,0.047398198395967484,0.9135901927947998,0.03901156783103943

Ebay,Do you think eBay is too bureaucratic when it comes to helping sellers? Are they robots?,"We have all probably been there, you know that you did everything correctly but end up getting punished in some way/having to pay extra in some way, and when you contact eBay about it, it is more or less impossible to get any proper help. They can never judge something case by case, they only follow their protocols like robots. Its like talking to a wall most of the time. And of course it doesnt matter if you are a top rated seller for years.

I am sure if a boy was drowning in front of their eyes, they wouldn't help him as its not written in their protocol.

Sometimes I wonder if its even humans who work there...Its us sellers who help to pay their salaries, but do they help us when we are in a pinch? Nope...   


What are your thoughts?",7,3,2019-10-31,EBAY,0.03226087614893913,0.9192565679550171,0.04848252609372139
Ebay,"Tracking indicates package ""delivered"". Postal worker admits they put it in a neighbors locked mailbox and can't retrieve it.","See title.  I have three packages ""delivered"" on or about the 12th of this month.  I submitted an inquiry on the usps site and got a response, see below.

&gt;I spoke with your carrier and he is attempting to locate your packages. It looks like the sub mis delivered them and the box they delivered to is a locking box so we have to wait until someone is home or responds to the note left for them. If he doesn't not find them today he will try again on Tuesday. If you do not receive them Tuesday I would contact the sender and let them know that you never received your package and see what they say. You can also go to USPS.com and file a claim for a missing package.

This case was marked ""closed"" and the tracking still shows delivered.  I oped a ""missing mail search"" about 10 days ago and have gotten no response.  

I went to talk with the postmaster, who identified herself as the person who wrote/sent the message above.  She says she cannot change the tracking info, nor can she make the neighbor give the package back.  She advised I file a claim...but the missing items are rare books sent media mail.  

I have messaged the seller's, they all replied that their responsibility ends once the tracking says ""delivered"".

Ebay has closed my disputes, again citing the tracking info.  

Any advice?  The neighbors aren't home when I am...but I will keep trying.  (I don't technically know which neighbor got the delivery...only that the GPS was close enough to match my address).

Edit:  Another question - If the neighbors mark it ""return to sender"" and drop it back in the mail will the tracking info update and help my case somehow?

Edit UPDATE:  Called Ebay and reviewed the situation.  They issued refunds on two items but not the big ticket item that was close to $300.  They need a police report to proceed, so I will get that going and see if I can get my money back.  Still have no idea where the books are - all neighbors I've contacted plead ignorance.",12,3,2019-10-31,EBAY,0.07629870623350143,0.9009735584259033,0.02272770367562771

Ebay,Faulty item - International Return Policy (Global Shipping Program),"Sorry in advance for the length and question spam.

So an item I ordered internationally through the Global Shipping Program from a seller in the US arrived with certain main functions not working,

I started a ""return request"" and after some time with no response from the seller, I escalated the issue.

A couple of days after escalation the seller finally sent a message (he replied under an old random message thread about the item and not the actual return request, which seemed a bit sketchy when coupled with the lack of response, if this is relevant)

Since the message exchange he has also transferred return shipping funds to me directly through paypal.

I have a few concerns:

1)ebay's return policy says: *""When the seller accepts your return, you'll receive an email to your Messages with the subject 'Send the item back'.""*  but the seller hasn't accepted the return, and after I specifically asked him through a message to accept it, he replied ""we no longer have an option to accept the return""

\-Is this possible? Could this be because the request is escalated?

\-Is it safe to ship the item back despite the return not being accepted on the website?

\-Because the return request hasn't been accepted and advanced to the next step I also won't be able to add the return shipping tracking to my return request.

2) The return policy also says that the seller is responsible for refunding the original shipping in ""not as described"" cases like this. Is this true also for GSP purchases where the shipping gets paid directly to Pitney Bowes?  Because the seller has specifically mentioned in our message exchange that only the product price will be refunded when the return arrives, and suggested that I shouldn't have a problem getting the refund for the shipping from Ebay/PitneyBowes

3) Is it possible in Not As Described returns to get a refund for the import charges from ebay/PitneyBowes? I've seen mixed responses in the ebay QA community about this, but some solved ""accepted solutions"" say that through contacting customer services you can get the import charges paid to Pitney Bowes refunded.

4) In regards to the last two questions, will the fact that he hasn't accepted the return request cause issues when I attempt to get a refund from ebay/PitneyBowes for the original shipping and import charges.

5) Are there any customs/import tax issues when an item arrives into the US? I don't want any further potential issues that my affect the return arrival and refund... Do parcels need to be officially marked as ""returned goods"" for customs purposes coming into the US, and if so how is that even done?

Thanks

\-----------------------------------------

EDIT: Finale Update: (in case anyone finds this while looking for info on GSP refunds)

So I got all the money back including the GSP funds (original shipping and taxes) and came out of the whole thing with no losses.

Important to note that I still believe GSP refunds aren't guaranteed to be refunded, especially the import tax portion, BUT...

Ebay returned the full GSP funds, and it was even unsolicited to my surprise, immediately after the seller refunded the item cost. They referred to it as a ""courtesy refund"", which is what leads me to believe it's a case by case thing and not guaranteed in every GSP case.

So, to sum up:

\-Seller refunded the item cost and the return shipping.

\-Ebay refunded original shipping and taxes (the entire GSP cost), unsolicited but probably not guaranteed in every case.",7,1,2019-10-31,EBAY,0.04749435558915138,0.9156494736671448,0.03685620054602623
