Ebay,"Ebay just billed me $90, I haven't sold anything.","Hi guys I've been trying to sell my alienware 15 gaming laptop on ebay for two months, every time It's been purchased / someone has won the bid, they end up not paying. So I did the whole ""they didnt pay"" dispute each time, and this has happened about 5 times now. It's starting to get very aggravating. On top of this whole thing, ebay just charged $92.52 to my paypal account. I haven't actually gotten paid from any of my buyers, so why was I charged 92 bucks?",21,27,2017-12-01,EBAY,0.038737405091524124,0.9165174961090088,0.044745028018951416

Ebay,Hoping for clarification from seller before paying for two identical items and would like some advice on how to proceed,"I won two auctions from the same seller a little over a day ago. A few hours before the auctions ended I sent the seller a message checking to make sure the items were separate items and not duplicate listings for the same item. Both listings used the same picture, and the seller had a third Buy It Now listing using that picture as well. It's perfectly reasonable that they indeed have three of the item and just chose to snap a single picture, but neither does that seem like a sure thing.

I didn't receive a reply before the auctions ended, but I wanted the items so I bid and won both. I then immediately requested an invoice and asked about combined shipping, but I mostly still wanted confirmation that I'd won two separate items.

I of course realize that a day and a half is not a long time to go without a response from the seller, but I began to wonder when I checked his profile and saw that 4 of the 14 reviews from users buying from him complained about never receiving any responses to their messages.

I'm pretty new to Ebay so I don't know what is supposed to happen here. All of my other purchases have been unambiguous and I paid for them within seconds of winning the bids.

Ebay,Local pickup selected instead of choosing a shipping option on large heavy item?,"Hi all, 

We recently had an item sell that is large and heavy and we had multiple options for shipping at the buyer's cost, 
1) USPS Parcel Select 
2) Fedex Ground and 
3) Free Local Pickup.

My questions are:

Does having free local pickup as an option negate the other services.. i.e. does it make the other options go away?

Is there any way that we can invoice them for shipping after they have already paid via paypal?

Is choosing free local pickup when that is not a possibility due to location just a thing that people do to try and scam us out of money and/or free shipping?

It is understood that when choosing shipping options free shipping always sounds better (free local pickup) but they live somewhere in California - we do not, and they sent us a message saying that they were under the impression that we could ship to them (which we obviously can considering the fact that we had multiple shipping options...) 
We responded saying that we think they may have chose the wrong shipping option and they have not responded yet. 

How do we fix this? As previously mentioned I'm mainly just wondering if the free local pickup option negates the other shipping services or if our buyer just either accidentally or on purpose chose the wrong shipping method to avoid paying shipping. 

edit: Buyer messaged us saying that he will pay for shipping, which meant that we had to cancel the original order - waiting on the buyer to purchase via buy it now which seems pretty unlikely.

Ebay,eBay Nightmare: I Was Double Charged for Seller Fees,"I was charged twice for my eBay seller fees, and now I'm worried about what will happen.

On 30 November, my seller fee invoice totaled for $248.21. I paid $250 via my PayPal balance (manually, as I always do. I never let them take the money automatically.) My balance was in the positive for +$1.79

1 hour later, I see another payment for $248.21 pending via eCheck. I thought it was just an error that would be remedied automatically.

Today I wake up and see my bank account overdrawn by -$248.21. I nearly had a heart attack after that, because my bank charges $30 per day for overdraft fees.

I check eBay and see my seller fee balance is a positive balance of +$250. I call eBay and the representative says they will refund the $250 balance back to my PayPal account. They say wait 24-48 hours to see it come back.

But the eBay website says I potentially could wait up to 30 days for the refund to post back to my account. As a poor college student, I don't have the $248.21 to put into my bank account to return it to zero. And waiting 30 days, getting charged $30 per day, well I don't even want to think about that.

Has anyone ever gotten a credit balance refunded back to them? How long did it take? I'm considering doing a bank chargeback so I don't get charged the overdraft fees. I know my eBay/PayPal will get shut down, but there's no way in hell I'm going to pay $30 a day.

Ebay,Shipping question.,"Hey guys.

Recently bought from a guy and he says he hasn't gotten payment although he shipped it. He didn't actually use the shipping that I paid for in the price and instead Shipped it straight through the post office. How can I get him his money?

Edit: problem solved.",3,3,2017-12-09,EBAY,0.2502220571041107,0.7043800354003906,0.045397982001304626
Ebay,Seller wins closed case appeal - who pays?,"I recently sold a device for $700 on ebay. In the description, I explained exact compatibility and even had the future buyer ask me and confirm they understood. I sold the device as-is with not returns. They eventually bought the device and then discovered it was not compatible and claimed it was defective. They opened a case against me and shipped back the product. My case was considered closed at this point. 

When I received the product, I confirmed that it was exactly how I shipped it and worked fine. Ebay credited half the money automatically back to the customer and billed my account the full amount plus the return shipping. 

I called ebay and opened an appeal. After signing an affidavit and describing the situation, eBay reversed the decision in my favor. They removed any charge back to my account. I asked them if I needed to ship the device back to the buyer and they said no. They said PayPal would handle everything with the buyer from here on out. So at this point, I have my device and the $700.

My question is this.. Who ends up paying that $700? Will they try and recoup it from the buyer? Does ebay/PayPal just eat it?

I'm more just interested in who is responsible for the money..",3,3,2017-12-09,EBAY,0.04051833227276802,0.9243325591087341,0.03514912724494934
Ebay,Buyer Opens Case of 'Item Not Received' - I have proof it was delivered to neighbour,"Timeline:

[(Screenshot)](https://i.imgur.com/RHXxK9M.png)

27/11 - Buyer purchases item

29/11 - Item posted 29th 9:00am 1st Class to arrive next working day. 

02/12 - The item was delivered to neighbour as no one was in to receive delivery

03/12 - Buyer opens a case asking where the item is

03/12 - I reply informing buyer the item had been sent and should have arrived 01/12 if not then 04/12 (ignoring weekend)

06/12 - Buyer replies informing me they haven't received still, and if I know where it is. 

06/12 - I reply with ""I have entered the reference code on Royal Mail website and it says the package has been delivered and is with a neighbour.""

07/12 - No reply off buyer, so I message with ""I assume you have collected the package, however I have now had a chargeback of the money you sent. Please could you resolve this as soon as possible."" 

08/12 - Still no reply so I repeat my request to close the case as I assume he has gone and collected the package as per the information regarding the package being with the neighbour

08/12 - Buyer replies, ""I still haven't received the item, i have not checked my local post office yet (although no card has been left at the delivery address). I also didn't request a refund (i assume ebay does this automatically)""

08/12 - I reply iterating the fact that it's at his neighbours and include the postage reference as proof

10/12 - No reply off buyer, informing him that I need an update on this case and mention, again, that the package is at a neighbours house. 

10/12 - I provide tracking details (just another bump to get him to sort it out)

So I currently have a negative balance in my PayPal because of this situation (the money is currently being held)

What are my options from here?

Ebay,Buyer wants expedited shipping. Is there an easy way to get them to pay for it?,"I sold an item and the buyer (brand new account - not sure if that makes a difference, probably not) stated in the note to seller during payment that they needed it by the 15th and if I could overnight the item. It was $10, and it's light (4 oz) so I was going to send first class. I checked and priority express will cost $23ish for flat rate envelope and priority will be $7.20 if I use a flat rate padded envelope.

I didn't have expedited as an option at checkout - actually I think I had it as a $3 flat rate for all (stupid me). Is there a way to invoice the buyer for the expedited shipping cost? I sent her a message through eBay with the priority and express options and the USPS estimated delivery times that eBay showed. 

If she doesn't respond today, should I just ship it first class since it's estimated to take 2-3 days anyway? I think the most important thing to get it there in time is for me to get the item in the mail quickly.

I know this is a lot of trouble for a $10 item but just wondering what you experts would do in this situation. I'm a somewhat novice seller. TIA!

*edit UPDATE*

Thanks for everyone's help! Luckily after a few hours the buyer responded to my message saying she wanted priority mail, so I sent an invoice through Paypal like everyone suggested, and she paid it.

DHL is currently asking for buyer's ID/Passport for verification from their end, and we have also forwarded the request to the buyer through eBay message,  but buyer has gone silent.

Now, the package will be returned to sender next week. eBay suggested us to wait for an INR case, and provide documents from DHL shows the reason why the package is on hold, and they ""might"" side with us.

However, I am wondering if it's wise to just issue a full refund by selecting ""Problem with buyer's address"" on the date of RTO, as I simply do not want to go through the case/appeal issue for a low value item. Will I get a defect by doing do?

Ebay,"Buyer requested a refund, returned an empty box but eBay already released the refund payment. Now the buyer has the money and the items. What are my options? (I have their address)","Hi all, looking for some advice as I have been scammed hard! UK ebayer here.

I was selling some control units for a digital audio workstation. The buyer messaged me a couple of times asking me to drop the price and eventually when it didn't sell I relisted and he bought it at the reduced starting price. Cue an absolutely hellish three days of terrible tech support where the buyer was thinking of any which way they could spin things to try and make me give some of their money back. 

The item was sold as two functional units and one unit for spares and repairs. The buyer was constantly raising issues about the one for S&amp;R saying that the problem I had described it with was different to the one it actually had. The trouble was they didn't really seem to actually know what they had bought and so trying to pick through what they thought was wrong with the items while also trying to teach them what the items were for was a nightmare. After a couple of days and 50 odd messages back and forth with repeated requests for partial refund I was begging them to just send the item back and i would refund them fully (at this point I was still undecided whether the buyer was trying to scam me or was really as much an idiot as they appeared). Eventually they agreed and logged a refund request through the ebay system, which I approved. 

When they finally sent the item back the box had nothing in but a half empty bottle of hair oil. Logged in to ebay and realised to my horror that the funds had already been released back to the buyer, most likely when they provided a legitimate tracking number. 

I have logged a complaint through PayPal and they have offered partial compensation but only for half of the value of the original item, which was very expensive. I don't want to just let this guy keep my money and my control surfaces and face absolutely no repercussions but i don't really know what to do here. 

Through some careful sleuthing I found the guys home address (this wasn't as simple as checking the postal address because we met at a location half way between us, another red flag that i won't miss in the future!) so i have his name and contact details. I have reported to the police as cyber crime / fraud but nothing seems to be happening and they are deferring to Paypal to resolve the issue, which is obviously working out great for the scammer but not so well for me.

Ebay,New eBay Returns Policy :(,"**New eBay ""Automatic Returns Policy""**

&gt;Beginning in October 2017, returns requests may automatically be accepted to make the returns process easier for you and your buyers. eBay will automatically accept a return request and provide a return shipping label to the buyer when the buyer pays for return shipping. 


http://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/seller-updates/2017-fall/returns.html#m17-1-tb1



I am a small volume seller, with niche items sometimes valued up to $1500. I accept returns, but want my items returned as I sent them, usually Priority, with full-value insurance and signature confirmation.



When I am able to converse with my buyer about a return, I can either negotiate they use these protected shipping methods, or I will pay to have the item returned as I prefer, and provide my buyer with a shipping label.



It looks to me as if I will now have no way of opting out of eBay's new ""automatic"" return feature, and I risk sellers using eBay's low-end shipping labels on my expensive items. 



Am I interpreting the new policy correctly? (Be sure to click on the FAQs button in the link I provided.)",17,10,2017-12-13,EBAY,0.022187484428286552,0.9371262788772583,0.04068629816174507

Ebay,Question about item not arrived and item not as described.,"1. I ordered an item that didn't show up at the expected delivery date, which was 4 weeks after the date of purchase. The seller sent me a message saying it would take 6 weeks for item to arrive. I was fine with waiting, and until the 6 weeks passed I opened up a request for refund, since the items did not arrive.
The seller is now wants to ship the items again. Which I can also accept because I would order the same items from another seller anyways. But here is my question, if I accept to the sellers purpose will I get a new estimated delivery date and will that again be protected by the  money back guarantee?

2.  Had an item show up as not as described, contacted the seller, and he refunded me and told me to keep the item.
But the thing is the item showed up in my in my cart as ""committed awaiting payment"" and I can't remove it, what to do?

Ebay,Automatic price drops on listing,"Hi All, first time poster here so go easy on me if my post is out of line.

Anyways, I'm watching an item on eBay that seems to automatically drop in price every so often.  (NOTE: the seller is selling multiple quantities so it's not a one off item.  They have ""more than 10 in stock"").  By the looks of it, it keeps dropping $0.20 or so in regular intervals and then eventually goes back up.  I'm guessing there's an app or add-on that allows a seller to set a list price and then continually drop the price in regular intervals until a purchase is made.

Can anyone confirm if this is the case?  I can't imagine someone is actively reducing the price on their item every hour (especially if the store/business has hundreds of items listed).

Ebay,PSA: Ebay now requires returns on parts or not working auctions where the buyers expect working parts,"Not gonna get into much detail, but I listed an auction for some non working computer parts which were listed in the parts or not working category and had a clear description stating that the parts do not work and it had ""sold as parts or not working"" in bolded text.

My buyer got the item and sent me a message saying that it was in pristine condition but started to ask a lot of questions about the item. Then, shortly afterwards they filed a return claim stating that the parts do not work and that now suddenly they were damaged.

Throughout the course of messaging them back and forth, I got the buyer to directly admit that he expected to get working parts. This is in addition to his first message describing the parts as pristine.

I THOUGHT it was an open and shut case with a quick call to ebay CS. Nope. Spent two days on the phone talking to 6 different CSR's, two of them even at the Utah location, and every single one of them said I needed to accept the return because this guy used the word ""damaged"". I literally got them to read the messages where the customer said the part was pristine and that they expected it to work, but the fact that he used the word ""damaged"" after all of that negated everything.

So now I have a return coming where the buyer thought he was going to get some working parts for super cheap, was butthurt when they indeed didn't work, and is sending me back the non working parts that are now damaged by him.

This is not a post looking for what to do - that's already set in stone here. It's just a PSA that if you THINK you're safe from returns by selling non working things, think again.",20,8,2017-12-14,EBAY,0.10843507200479507,0.862249493598938,0.02931547909975052

Ebay,"eBay ruled a case in my favor but I never got my money, it's been 3 weeks","I buy and sell trading cards on eBay. I sold $23 worth of cards to a buyer and they claimed to never receive them. Since I didn't send it tracked I had no grounds to fight it. Here's a timeline rundown to keep things short

**November 8** My listing sold

**November 9** I shipped out the items

**November 18** Buyer opens a case because item never arrived

**November 20** I refund the buyer on the eBay site by using a PayPal eCheck. The eCheck shows as pending on my PayPal and email says it should process by November 24. Case status shows I sent a refund.

**November 21** eCheck amount ($23) withdrawn from my bank account. Expected. 

**November 24** eCheck is still pending on my PayPal for some reason. Buyer messages me saying they never got the money. I tell him I don't know what to do and tell him to ask eBay.

**November 27** eBay says the buyer asked for their intervention and they will make a final decision on my case in 48 hours. Weird. eCheck is *still* processing.

**November 28** eBay rules the case in favor of the buyer, they charge my debit card on file for $23. What the heck??

&gt;An hour later I get an email from PayPal letting me know the eCheck has finally processed. Buyer now has two refunds?? 

**November 30** A charge goes through on my bank account for $23 from eBay buyer protection. Confirmed, two refunds.

**November 30** I called PayPal and they said there's nothing they can do so I called eBay. After an hour of back and forth I finally convince them I was charged twice. They appealed and turned the case over in my favor (seller). Representative says I should receive my refund for $23 in the next 48 hours on my PayPal. I even got an email saying so. Didn't happen.

**December 2** Told my entire story again, said I didn't get a refund. They said they would try again and to give it another 48 hours. Didn't happen.

**December 5** Called eBay, explained the whole story a third time. They said they would put a specific team on it (name escapes me) and that I'm definitely owed this money. I should expect the funds within 5-7 days. 

**December 6** Called just to check if they were pulling my leg. This person confirms with me that the claim was indeed sent and should be resolved no later than December 11.

**December 11** Guess what? I don't have my money! I called eBay and explained my case, again. The guy I talked to this time was way better than the previous 4. He said my claim was indeed filed and denied around December 7. So I wasted all this time waiting to call. This eBay person filed another claim and personally said he would look into it and that it should be another 5-7 days---but he would keep me posted. He requested a bunch of screenshots for my case to prove it and I sent him the damned best evidence I could come up with.


And that's where I am now. I'm literally spending hours on the phone with eBay trying to get my damn $23 back. And I found new details on why my first claim was denied---that specific eBay associate requested I be refunded $46 instead of $23. No wonder they denied that instantly. What can I do reddit?

Ebay,Help being Terrorised by the eBay Buyer from Hell,"A few weeks ago we tried to sell some old Vintage HiFi equipment - The items are very large and heavy and so we set the auction to be collect in person only. Several people bidded on the item and one chap won it and I sent him the eBay invoice right away. instead of paying he then starts emailing me to ask if I can deliver it to him - which I cannot as the items are huge and comprise of several boxes which is why I put the items up for collection only. 

He also asks can I connect it all up and guarantee it all works which I cannot as I don't have the cables. I was able to plug most of the items in the the mains and show the lights come on, fans turn, etc and stated that in my sales page along with photos to show the lights were turned on. Then he emails back after a few days and says he noticed the button missing on one of the items - which I clearly took a photo of to show they were missing.

I contacted eBay customer support and they advised me to use the resolution centre to ask for payment within 4 days or the guy could just ignore it and after 4 days the sale is cancelled. So I did that.

However the guy emailed me to say he has no intention of getting a strike against his eBay buyer's name and intends to pay for the items with 4 days but never collect and instead pursue me for a refund.

I checked his own references and at first it appear he has nothing but a perfect buyers record but when you actually read what some people have written about the guy they've said he's done this kind of thing before - buys and doesn't pay.

Ebay,Are you allowed to use ebay gift cards to buy other gift cards?,"Quite frequently I see ebay deals such as ""$25 off $100"" in purchases or ""$100 ebay gift card for $80"". For the former, are gift cards usually excluded? 

To be honest, I've only ever known ebay as an auctioning site for individual customers, but it seems companies also sell stuff on ebay. Also, ebay seems to sell gift cards to other places at PP Digital Gifts.

Can I use ebay gift cards to buy all these items, including other gift cards?

My plan is to always take advantage of ebay deals and use ebay gift cards to purchase other gift cards at a discount. Any tips? Potential caveats I should watch out for?

Ebay,eBay - Tax help,"I was wondering how other people do taxes with eBay. Basically, I remembered to keep all my sales receipts from stores, but did not realize I would only be able to get sales reports of max 90 days.

I pretty much was counting on Q4 being slow for eBay and concentrate on FBA. During this slow time I was going to clean up my books. Now I only have data going back to September. Is there a way to get a 2017 sales report through eBay?

Sure it would be nice to be able to find a solution for this year, but primarily I want to see how others do their books so I can start 2018 off right. What are some suggestions to do book keeping right?

Ebay,"Need help with a buyer. I sold him a keyboard that turned out to be slightly broken, but now he is demanding I give him a full refund","I'm a casual seller on ebay.  I build a lot of PCs for friends and family, leading to extra parts laying around.  I put a keyboard up for sale and I noticed the backlighting (lighting behind the keys) only acting intermittently, so I advertised it as having a loose wire that could probably be fixed.

So, the buyer received it and it turns out that it wasn't due to a loose wire, but because one of the cords are shot (according to him).  The actual keyboard still works, but the backlighting is not going to work and the buyer is now threatening to file a claim with Paypal unless I ""make other arrangements.""

I offered to cover the cost of return shipping and give him 20% back on a refund to compensate him, but he's saying that he spent an extra $40 to bring it to the shop and have the problem ""examined.""

While it's on me for listing it incorrectly, I feel like this isn't really fair.  He's demanding that he keeps the item (a fully working keyboard with only just the lighting not working) while I give him essentially a full refund ($40 back on a $53 order, with me having already spent $10 on shipping).  He says that my 20% is not fair because he had to bring it to a shop to get looked at and he's including that in the full price.

Here's the e-mail he sent me:

&gt; don't know what you mean by 20% of the "" total "" ......

&gt;20 % of $93.00 is 18.60... that means I just bite the bullet for the other 75 dollars ?? and end up with nothing...

&gt;No Thanks !! I'll get my 53 bucks back from PayPal if I file the claim.... and I have the receipt from the computer shop showing it's no "" loose wire easily fixed."" 

&gt;If you want to settle this fairly with no PayPal claim against you then make me a decent refund offer.... 

&gt;Save the Ten bucks for shipping... and the 19.80 20 %.

&gt;I'll spend the additional money to get a new cord made up... just refund me 40 bucks and I'll call it even...

&gt;And this Keyboard will still have cost me... 

&gt;close to a hundred.... 53 + 40 for trouble shooting + cord cost of another hour (40$) = 133$ - 40 refund = 93$ plus all the trouble of running around getting it analyzed and now back for the cord.

&gt;In the end... we'll be even.... It was your fault for listing it without the truth about it and mine for believing it and trying to have it fixed quick.

&gt;Let me know if you agree to this and I'll hold up the claim...

What should I do in this situation?  What can I do?  It's all a mess.  If I had known this was what would've happened, I would have just kept the keyboard and given it to a friend.",16,4,2017-12-16,EBAY,0.1648293435573578,0.8057665228843689,0.02940415032207966

I ordered my item, and wouldn't you know, I check the USPS tracking number and it's shipping from China Post.

I was pretty annoyed by this, but I let it go since I'm not refunding something over the shipping time since it doesn't matter that much.

Obviously, December 4 comes and goes since nothing is going to get here that fast from China with free shipping. By now the item has not gotten to the US as far as I can tell, since the USPS tracking's last update is, ""PROCESSED THROUGH FACILITY
SHENYANG EMS, CHINA"". I guess I can't complain too much, since shipping was free, but two weeks past expected delivery and not disclosing the item's actual location is pretty obnoxious in my opinion.

I called them and they can't reactivate it, instead I have to wait 5-7 business days to get my new card.

Ebay,Item I purchased has serial number removed and is different model than the listing... but I'm just realizing this 11 months later.,"I'm assuming I'm screwed but it's worth a shot.

I purchased what I thought was a Sonos Connect for $275 in January 2017. Everything was working great until recently when it started showing signs of hardware problems.

Obviously I'm not running back to the seller 11 months later, so I contacted Sonos customer support. After some troubleshooting they said it sound hardware related, but that they can offer an out of warranty repair/replacement for a reasonable fee. He asked for the serial number on the label on the bottom of the device. That's when I realized there was no label, the seller presumably removed it. Because there's no label, Sonos can't help me out at all. Which really sucks.

I also discovered that the device isn't even the Sonos Connect, it's a Sonos ZP80 (essentially the same thing, just an older model). The item listing said ""Sonos Connect"" in the title and description, although did contradict itself and say ZP90 (not 80, which is what I got) in one section.

So do I have any chance of resolving this or am I out of luck? I contacted the seller and described the issue, mainly probing for why the serial number was removed as this seems shady (and the most important part since that ruins my chance of Sonos replacing it).",16,7,2017-12-20,EBAY,0.16834238171577454,0.8009017705917358,0.03075582906603813

Ebay,Question about difficult buyer,"Have a similar issue to another recent post where I am being threatened with potential negative feedback. For starters, I am no power seller, just a guy who lists a few old household items every once in a while.

The item I listed was an old Polaroid camera. The item sold on Sunday and I planned on shipping out the item Tuesday. The item was listed with USPS Priority Mail and 2 days handling. I received an email Monday night with a prepaid FedEx label asking me to use that because the buyer had to fill an out of stock Amazon sale using my item. I did not use the label and instead sent the item via USPS as listed. They then messaged asking if I had seen their prepaid label. I responded saying I did not feel comfortable using their label and the item was already dropped off at USPS and tracking number was available. They then requested a return for did not mean to buy the product and the message stated to either pick it back up from USPS and affix their label or cancel. I declined.

They then messaged me again saying I should have contacted them about it and given them the option to cancel. They again mentioned that they had a next day shipment that they were paid extra for that the item would be used for. I responded apologizing and saying that the item had already been dropped off at USPS, which I reminded them was the agreed upon shipping method listed. I pointed out that them accepting an order on something not in stock was not my fault. They then sent me the following message:

""You better pray my customer doesn't get upset and leave me a one star rating because if she does i'll leave the same feedback to you not because you didn't do the order the way i asked you have a right to do that but because you didn't tell me in advance you were planning to ignore my instructions and do the opposite it is a classic poor communication and poor customer service and just like it is your ""right"" to ship how you want it is my ""right"" to leave a bad feedback. And 1 negative feedback hurts a sellers account for a long time untill it is either revised by the buyer who left it at your request which can be done for 90 days i believe or untill you start selling full time and get alot of good feedbacks to cover it so pray hard my friend...""

I am wondering what I should do here? Report this to eBay to get ahead of it or wait and see if they leave negative feedback and then try to get it cleared? Thanks for any help.",8,6,2017-12-20,EBAY,0.09579318016767502,0.8721521496772766,0.03205462545156479

Ebay,Seller wants a refund on item sold 3 months ago,"Casual Ebayer here.  Occasionally I sell some of my vintage clothes on EBay although these days its become less of a hobby.  In September I listed a few items,  including a pristine silk designer dress,  which sold for far less than I was expecting ($12). After the auction closed,  the buyer contacted me in an attempt to negotiate the very reasonable shipping cost ($4.50) which I did not agree too, however,  I did offer to cancel her bid if she felt the shipping was too costly. I mailed out the dress the next day (9/27) and haven't heard from the buyer since. 

Last night I received a long message, one meant for Ebay customer service, about how she is unsatisfied with the item, and claims there was some packaging material stuck to the dress upon arrival, and that she damaged the delicate silk in an attempt to remove it, and would like a full refund. I replied, asking why she didnt contact me sooner, and even though my 30 day return window is long since past, I offered her a full refund, if she shipped the item back to me. She declined this offer, saying she didn't want to pay the return shipping, and that if I wasn't going to issue a refund, she would be escalating the claim to Ebay customer support. The feedback window on this item is closed, but I know EBay has a history of siding with buyers, however unreasonable. Should I issue a refund, or just wait and see what happens?

**TLDR: Sold dress 3 months ago, seller contacted me for the first time last night. She refuses to return the item, but expects me to issue her a complete refund and is threatening to escalate her claim if I do not agree to her terms, am I safe to ignore her?**",9,4,2017-12-20,EBAY,0.04906419664621353,0.9099015593528748,0.04103424772620201

Ebay,Auction Bidders,"(I hope this post makes it as a different post was deleted because I had just opened an account but that was a few days ago, so hopefully this one will go through.)

I inadvertently listed an item for auction instead of buy-it-now. I realized it as soon as I received an email saying my listing is posted and it had the auction starting bid. Less than a minute I had a bidder bidding the minimum. As I was going through the FAQ, from what I gathered, I was not able to take off my listing. So, I resigned to the fact that someone was going to be super happy.

There are about 6 bidders that were bidding in a dollar increments (I think, I'm very new), but yesterday morning my phone went crazy with a slew of ""cha-chings"" and went I looked at the bids, it jumped up by 20.00 with about 30 hours left. No other bids since then though. Just now I looked at the activity after a friend told me how I can see it by clicking on ""bids"", what I saw was the same user in a very short period of time (within a minute) was bidding.

This makes no sense to me. Why is this person outbidding her/hisself? This makes no sense to me and I would appreciate any opinions, insights.",7,3,2017-12-20,EBAY,0.03492703288793564,0.913972795009613,0.05110018327832222

Ebay,"Buyer lost case with PayPal/ebay, but still got the money &amp; item.","Well, it happened again...

I'm done selling on ebay as long as it involves PayPal. Some idiot buyer with no understanding or comprehension of what he was buying won my ""not working sold as-is for parts listing"" and then wanted his money back saying nothing worked...no shit.

I called PayPal and they immediately sided in my favor after reviewing the listing and our communications. However, months later he did a charge-back with his credit card company and they returned his money! forcing PayPal to return the funds and debit my account the amount + a $20 charge-back fee!!

I've started an appeal, but I don't see how the financial institution can give him back his money if they even bothered communicating with ebay and PayPal and since they guy clearly NEVER returned the goods!

I'm shocked and disgusted that this is allowed. It's THEFT and I will not rest until I have my money back and PayPal and ebay are forced to change their policies to prevent this abuse of their system from happening.

If I didn't have funds in my PayPal they would never have gotten the money from me.

If you're an ebay seller/PayPal user I strongly recommend you immediately stop using the platform, or at least un-link your bank account.

Ebay,How do I made good offers as a buyer?,"So I am one of those low ballers that send 50% of BIN offers. I figured people would counter offer and we reach a reasonable price. I don't actually expect anyone to accept the low ball nor do I want to waste your time. To me, low ball offering is signaling an interest in the item.

What I didn't realize is that people get offended with these offers and assume I would scam them. Some sellers actually counter offer and haggle but others block. Some say that %50 is low balling and some think it's 30% off. 

As to why I am posting this, I just find it interesting that the expectations of buyers and sellers aren't always the same. Some sellers place their BIN high and expect people to use best offers. Some sellers set their BIN at a reasonable price and use best offers as a back up plan. The""reasonable offer"" is always in flux and not set in stone.

So how should I deal with these different expectations when I offer? I don't want to get blocked but I still want to haggle a bit.",25,9,2017-12-21,EBAY,0.028972038999199867,0.9215041399002075,0.04952379688620567

Ebay,USPS First Class shipping taking 2-3 weeks. Losing hundreds,"I have a small home business where I sell items and since they are under the weight limit I ship First Class and advertise as such on all my listings.

Since the beginning of December I have shipped well over 100 items via this method and 75% of them are delayed 2-3 weeks. (Items from Dec 4th just starting to deliver yesterday). All within the USA.

I have buyers extremely pissed (I  understand why) and requesting refunds. Many cases are now pending as I hope their items start showing up before ebay default wins to them. A few have done that already and their item always shows up a few days later after getting their money back.

I am losing hundreds of dollars on products, shipping, refunds, and my time.

Is anyone else experiencing any major delays like this? Should I even bother to call USPS or will they just string me along?

Thanks

Ebay,"New to selling, some ride customer accused me of doing illegal things because his company won't accept the phone I sold him?","It's a T-Mobile phone, Samsung galaxy core. I sold it for $30. It's not super nice. But it works. I made sure it works. It was totally paid off and then the account was cancelled because my dad died and he was the one who paid for it. I'm pretty sure it was paid off. Because he didn't die until at least a year after and the phone was only $140 and he still paid the monthly fee. But anyway I sold it on eBay, factory reset it before I sent it off. Checked it and it was working fine. I sold it a couple weeks ago, would have to check the date but it was around the 10th. Tonight I get an angry message from the buyer saying I sold him a useless piece of plastic, his carrier is saying it's locked and that it's illegal and I'm breaking the law and all this. He wants to return it for a refund. My deal is I already spent the money. I'm broke. I can't get the money to refund him and I don't think the return is warranted because it works just fine and he's going to give me bad feedback because of this. What should I do?

Ebay,Success story! Buyer admitted he didn't read item description and wanted to return then opened INAD request saying the item wasn't authentic.,"I have read SO many stories and comments where people say eBay sides with the buyer 100% of the time so I am just really happy I have a success story as a seller.

Basically, I sold a custom made lightsaber on eBay. If anyone even tried to claim it was being sold as a replica or counterfeit of say Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, they would be laughed at because it is so far different. It's a unique model. In my description I was super detailed about how it has no sound, might have scratches because of custom machine work etc. 

Any way buyer made me an offer for $20 off and I accepted. He didn't pay for a few days so got an unpaid buyer case opened automatically. He paid a couple of days later and I shipped and miraculously  the item arrived two days later in time for christmas, as he had hoped it would. Then on christmas morning he sends an email saying that he wants to return because it has no sound and he was looking to buy one of those official 'authentic' lightsabers like you see in the store. Well I replied that it was very detailed in the description that it had no sound, and that it was a custom item. HE EMAILED ME BACK ""I DIDN'T READ THE DESCRIPTION"". After a few emails he was getting mad and claiming I sold him an inauthentic counterfeit blablabla. 

Well I messaged AskEbay on Twitter, gave them all my information so they can look into my account, and today I woke up with a message saying:


""Thanks for providing the detailed info and the registered account info so I could review the Return.

Ebay,Lying buyer threatening with police action.,"I sold a brand new SEALED video game (final fantasy 9) to a woman who claims it is not real because it has a silver back instead of the black back like the first prints used to have. I bought these games straight from the square enix site and have all the invoices and receipts to prove it. Also in the return request she said its fake and even took a picture of her holding the front and back of the disc (which clearly shows the genuine product) she honestly believes it's fake just because she doesnt know that all new square enix ps1 games on their site ship on a silver disc instead of the OG black ones. This has been true for games like Chrono Cross, Final Fantasy Origins, Final Fantasy 9, etc. All square enix games.

 I gave her a refund within 12 hours to get her out of my hair (it was only 14.99) and now she says the item is in the hands of the authorities (the genuine item might I add since she is too misinformed to realize it is in fact genuine and a different variant print). I then proceeded to send her screen shots of the invoices, videos of people on youtube unboxing the same exact looking game (silver backed) straight from square enix. I contacted square enix through email and they responded that it's because they changed their printing press procedure and all ps1 games are like this and not black anymore. A simple google search also shows people talking about this issue and that yes the silver backed are the norm now. She refuses to listen and keeps calling me names like ""fraud"" and ""scammer"".  Threatening me that I am committing multiple felonies like mail fraud and selling bootleg items.

This all sounds so ridiculous, and 95% part of me thinks that she was just trying to get a freebie, but there are some ignorant people out there that don't know squat and wont listen to reason. I have sent multiple pics of proof proving its authenticity, etc. Let's say she really did report me and they have my item. What now? This is stressing me out (I have sold hundreds of these games bought straight from the square enix store and have NEVER had a problem.)

P.S: I told her to buy straight from square enix herself if she doesn't believe me so she can see she will receive the exact same silver backed discs but once she got a refund she completely has ignored me. Was this a scamming buyer, or just really a buyer who has no idea what she is talking about?

Ebay,I won an appeal as seller. I think,"Hello. Long-time lurker,sort of long time seller. I have almost 500 transactions and this past transaction was the one I knew would eventually happen. The buyer basically lied so I would pay return shipping, I was told by the 6th eBay rep I spoke with, to accept the return and we would go from there. Once I received the item back, it was not how I had mailed it, and he told me to immediately call eBay, which I did. The return case was opened 6 days after the customer had received the items and they definitely were worn.

 I took tons of pictures and have called maybe 12 times so they're probably sick and tired of me.haha.  12:00 am this morning, I get an email saying they decided in the buyer's case yada yada yada because I accepted the return but they did appreciate my professionalism and my long term standing with eBay blah blah blah, I was livid. I immediately called eBay spoke with a representative who transferred me to escalations where I spoke with a very nice young man who had the power I guess to appeal the decision and he did in my favor.

Within minutes the money was back in my PayPal account. 

My question is to everybody here, does the buyer also receive their money back? Or did it get pulled back out of there PayPal account? or is it pending? Did eBay just kind of give me a one-time courtesy refund because I've been in their eyes a great seller? I know this is very shallow and immature of me but she did not deserve any money back, she was horrible, rude, mean and nasty to me all to which I did not reply unless I was told to by an eBay representative and when I did I was as sweet as could be and professional as could be.

I'm sorry if I'm ranting and going on and on but this is has been an almost two week long process that I was not giving up on because I truly believed I could win this one. Now, I'm thinking he gave me a courtesy refund because he felt sorry for me. I want to know if she got the refund also but not sure how to find that out. I guess it's really not important, what's done is done, but I'm just being kind of nosey I guess haha. Thank you to all who read all of this. I appreciate it and now time for bed finally.",6,5,2017-12-27,EBAY,0.0514107346534729,0.9123557806015015,0.03623341768980026

Ebay,Dealing with a lunatic wanting to return.,"Okay, so the whole background story was posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/7ljzsm/christmas_time_for_wackadoodles/) Tl;dr Buyer needed a poster for a Christmas gift, ordered too late, USPS did not deliver in time before Christmas, he threatened to take me to court for not receiving item for Christmas.
He opens item not received case. 

So, he finally receives the item, day after Christmas, and of course first thing he does he adds to the INR  case and has the poster crumpled up saying it's damaged and he cannot frame it. Alas, he no longer needs it as Christmas is over. Escalates, ebay closes it and releases money without refund to buyer.

He sends me a message saying he has my address now, and he will serve subpoena. (..............I can't.)

I wake up this morning he opened another case, this time - item not as described, again claiming the poster is crumpled up since he no longer needs it, he smashed it and ruined the item. I posted it in a hard tube, so one has to really step on it and smash the corners of it. He states he cannot frame it, wants to return.

I uploaded picture of the actual poster as it was shown in the listing, how it was inside the tube. Called ebay, ebay assistant looked at his messages and was like - well he sounds mentally deranged. Then he proceeds to say, sorry can't do nothing right now, request will be open until Jan 3, then ebay will decide. We don't know if buyer messed up the item himself or USPS did it. 

I asked how his harassment messages do not warrant some sort of proof and how he explicitly said he only needed for Christmas and I uploaded all pictures how it left my hands. And they can't do nothing. I had few unreasonable buyers through the years and ebay usually resolved, looked at the facts no problems. I have the craziest buyer to this day who has been harassing and threatening court and writing me non stop, and ebay is doing nothing. So, my question is, is there anything else should I do? Chance it, wait it until January 3rd? Just accept return worthless damaged item he damaged and take a loss of $100 and accept all the harassment I got and then a negative feedback as well? Or anything else? Any input would be appreciated.",13,4,2017-12-27,EBAY,0.07523509860038757,0.8973466157913208,0.027418309822678566
Ebay,"Item I purchased was defective, seller seems resistant to me returning it. What do I do?","Small time ebay user, occasionally use for hard to find gifts.

Bought my little sister a banjo for Christmas from a seller with 6700+ ratings and a 98.5% rate. 

When the banjo came the bridge grooves were too shallow to hold the strings in place, and when tightening the strings the entire neck twists.

My sister said its basically unusable, and I should return it.

Contacted the seller, he said he wants photos in order to provide me with different, ""solutions,"" instead of return. 

I told him I wasn't interested in altering or fixing something brand new that I had just bought. I'm not handy and I wasn't looking to buy a project, just a banjo.

He responded with the EXACT same post as his original, copy and pasted.

I reiterated what I said originally, now he hasn't responded.

So fun fact, if someone clicks on your listing thru promoted listings and commits to buy, but never buys, or buys and cancels the order shortly after. eBay does not reverse the Ad Fees automatically. You have to contact them and request they get reversed.

This has been an issue since promoted listings became live, and still no fix, and i bet there are thousands of people just giving away free money to eBay because they dont know that they are getting charged for this.

Please spread awareness, and so enough people message customer support about this, and hopefully they will fix this instead of trying to fix an already broken gui.

Ebay,[Help] Seller Sending a Placeholder?,"I bought a computer on eBay and I got an empty envelope (from USPS) from the seller today. The weird thing is, the computer I bought has been shipped with a FedEx tracking number and it's on its way.

He did that as a ""placeholder"" and shipped out my computer yesterday.

Wrong-ish because it's the 6th disc of the first season of the show, but from the original and not the remake of the show, like the listing implied. Everything as far as I can tell days it's from the remake, not the original.

I messaged the seller (with picture of what I recieved) and so far they haven't gotten back to me (reasonable seeing as it's only been a few hours).

Ebay,"Insurance on Priority Mail, Customer Claims, and Shipping Framed Artists Prints","If I'm reading the USPS regulations regarding insurance on priority mail correctly, it appears as if all items shipped through priority mail that is purchased through Ebay automatically have $100 of insurance coverage. Here's the link: https://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/503.htm#ep1063624

I'm listing some framed artists prints that should sell for about $75. If I understand this correctly, I don't have to purchase additional shipping insurance. If the frame/glass breaks, the cost of the repair is already covered up to the cost of the item (which will be less than $100), and I can just tell the buyer to file a claim with the post office. 

Does that sound correct? 

I'm just trying to anticipate problems. Up until this point, I've primarily sold things that aren't particularly fragile. I've even wen't ahead and bought the heavy duty picture packer kits they sell at u-haul (I'm making my own custom boxes).

Ebay,Reminder to use separate accounts for purchasing!,"Hi all.

I recently purchased a video game for a family member this Christmas. The seller indicated they'd be shipping First Class, and then printed a Media Mail label (which would make it arrive late/is against USPS rules, might be illegal)

I asked them to ship First Class as indicated, and they became extremely belligerent, but did so anyway after several days.

In the end I received the item on time, and gave them a neutral feedback. A few days pass, and they send me a nasty eBay message, saying I will fail in life, and my business will fail, and that's it's wrong to run an eBay business as a job...

Ebay,Seller says they will not send item. NO refund. NO help from ebay. NO help from paypal. Still has 51 items for sale!!!,"In short, I bought something for $87 on 12/5,  Seller sent email that they did not have item on 12/7, and have not credited my paypal account as of 12/29/2017.

Paypal offers no help other than a poor emailing system to seller. Seller has not responded since 12/7.  Paypal sent me email today, 12/29, that they were closing the case unless I elevated the matter by 12/31.  I went to paypal but the system has no way to elevate the case.  They do offer a way to start a new case but only with a single selection for cause which is ""Unathorized use of account"" which I selected, but only after entering paypal through another browser (first with Safari and then with Firefox) just to see if it was a browser issue.

Ebay's system was similarly disfunctional - almost as though they were written by the same person - and it would only allow me to send emails to the seller, who again never responded.

Today I called ebay and actually spoke with a person, Deserie, who let me know that I needed to work through the paypal system even though I explained that the system was disfunctional (but I guess she already knew that).

I asked Deserie to simply call paypal, work it out, credit my account, and call me when that was done.  She cannot do that!

Okay, this is what we have...

* A paid purchase
* A seller who admitted by ebay email that they no longer had the product
* A seller who refuses to communicate
* A seller who has currently 51 items now listed at ebay
* A buyer who is a 12-year member at ebay
* A buyer who is a 10-year member at paypal
* A buyer who simply wants a credit
* A buyer who, in this time, has never requested a credit on well over 100 purchases
* An ebay system that does not work well enough to resolve even this simple of an issue
* A paypal system that does not work well enough to resolve even this simple of an issue
* An ebay and paypal attitude of ""not my problem"" and the lack of willingness to pickup a phone and call each other and fix this
* An ebay system that allows this seller to continue to list product on ebay

I was actually concerned that maybe the buyer had some family emergency or health issue and was away from the job.... until I checked on current activity... and found they have 51 current listings.

And, there is not even a dispute on if the item was delivered.  The seller stated in an email that they could not send the product.  How easy is this?

Ebay,Ebayer threatens to leave negative BEFORE even purchasing an item. You gotta love ebay buyers.,"So a guy messages me a question about an item of clothing, an everyday thing in my line of ebay selling, and closes the message with ""by the way, if i purchase the item and it arrives in any condition that is not retail condition i WILL leave negative feedback. 

So i immediately block him and respond that it be better that he purchase from someone else, because as long as the seller actively responds and takes care of the buyers issue, Ebay heavily discourages negative feedback with issues like this because it hurts the selling community and makes sellers seek out other places online to sell. 

I understand how frustrating it can be to a buyer when an item arrives that is not in the condition expected, but try to remember, sellers make mistakes, they are human, and many many sellers on ebay will bend over backwards to compensate a buyer, so negative feedback is rarely needed.

After explaining that to him responds by saying he would never buy from me anyway, since if im that worried about him leaving negative feedback i must be a scammer of some kind.

Ebay,EBay actually closed a case in my favor as the seller. It's a Christmas miracle.,"About a month ago, I had a buyer open up a case against me claiming the item I send them was fake and that they wanted a refund. The item only cost $40 and was pretty much a chunk of metal (a random gun part) but they said they took it too an expert and the expert claimed it didn't look authentic. Red flags buzzed in my head because the item I sent wasn't an expensive item that's popular to fake, like an iPhone or basketball shoe or something, it was a solid chunk of metal with almost no moving parts. Why would someone take something that small can relatively cheap to an expert to get it verified? 

So I sent them a message asking them why they thought it was fake and they never responded. I waited a week and thne just thought, whatever, I'll loose the cost of 2 shipping labels to not get a negative strike on my account, it wasn't worth the trouble of fighting for $40. I sent them a message to return it and I'd refund their money, but they still didn't respond. 

So they still had the item and I still had an hold on the money in my account, so I contacted eBay to see if they'd step in. They sided with the buyer saying that any claims of an item being fake, even without any proof, the buyer wins. I waited a week, no returned item or response from the buyer. I contacted eBay again, asked them if the return label had been used, they said it hadn't, and that the buyer missed the deadline, so they overturned their original decision, closed the case in my favor, and took the hold off of the funds. 

Maybe the buyer just changed their mind and decided to keep the item without closing the case, they did have a very low feedback score, maybe they weren't familiar with eBay. Maybe they were out of town for the holidays during the deadline and just missed it. Either way, I'm surprised to have a case like this end in my favor. 

All I can say is be polite and professional in all of your communications with customers, even if they're accusing you of fraud. The representative from eBay working on my case said my level of courtesy and my expressed willingness to send a refund in my messages to the buyer made it easier for them to close the case in my favor. It showed a willingness to cooperate and the buyer never responded so eventually sided with me. 

And now, no more selling before the holidays. Every year, 90% of all my issues with buyers happens around December. Next year, I'm not even going to bother with it.",9,18,2017-12-30,EBAY,0.0836893618106842,0.8755101561546326,0.04080042988061905

While scrolling through some moderately priced ($200-$300) Vintage LV bags for my wife for a Christmas present there was a coupon for 15% women's handbags that kept showing up. The code was PBAGS15. 

I found a nice one for her and I negotiate with the seller and we settle on a price. I proceed to pay and go to enter the code. It then tells me the code is invalid. 

So I contact ebay, they tell me that promotion is over a month old. They ask for a screenshot of the page with the coupon code (which I give them). It included time and date since it was from my phone. I'm told they are unsure of why the promotion is still showing up but they will forward it to their marketing department and get me an equal value code that works.

3 days go by...I get an email stating the code is invalid and they cannot issue me a code of equal value. But not to worry because there will be coupons in the future.

Obviously, there isn't much I can do but I think that this is a real scum bag move to do. It's their website running their coupon. If this happened at a big box store I could almost guarantee the coupon/price would have been honored. Then to tell me more coupons will be available in the future. I don't need them in the future, I needed the ~$41 coupon now.

Not sure if anyone else has had a problem like this before, but I just wanted to put it out there to make people aware.",1,7,2017-12-30,EBAY,0.035273514688014984,0.9291241765022278,0.03560228273272514
Ebay,Does anyone sell on other sites?,"Mornings guys. 

I was just wondering if any of you sell on other sites as well as EBay.  ?

I have been thinking about this for a while but not sure about it. 

What do you guys think? 

Is it worth selling elsewhere?
Where else do you sell?
What’s the best ones to try?

Thanks all.   Have a great day",5,6,2017-12-30,EBAY,0.013544393703341484,0.7908985018730164,0.19555705785751343

Ebay,Buyer gave me negative feedback for no reason,"I'm currently discussing this with eBay to see if I can get the feedback removed. 

So I sold him a Samsung tablet, £10 less than what most retailers are selling it and he was messaging me ""is this too good to be true?"", Stuff like that. I said no they're brand new.

So he buys one and I ship a couple hours after he orders it, brand new and sealed. I have it tracked and it arrives 2 days after he bought it so before the 3-5 day estimate I normally give my customers. I then see he only gave me 2 stars so am message him asking if everything was alright and why the feedback was negative. He said the tablet arrived late but I said to him I know when he received it so he backtracked and said e asked for next day delivery but it clearly says on his order 2nd class delivery. I eventually tell him if he can't give me a genuine reason why the feedback was so bad I'm going to report him.",3,15,2017-12-31,EBAY,0.21866606175899506,0.7436526417732239,0.03768126666545868
Ebay,"Potentially found seller of my stolen TV, what do I do?","My home was recently burglarized, but at least I have the model number and serial number for my TV.

The issue is that in all the pictures the serial number is censored so I can't confirm it's actually mine. What can I do?",30,15,2017-12-31,EBAY,0.05970975384116173,0.9067584872245789,0.033531688153743744
Ebay,ITEM won’t sell @ BIN for $20 but gets bid up to $50 at auction?,"Does anyone know why or have any theories as to why I can put an item up for sale for say $30 and it doesn’t sell gets no action no watchers no nothing so I keep bringing down the price 20 percent every month or so and nothing.

Ebay,"Selling anxiety, total newbie to selling things","So recently I've decided to sell some valuables of mine and it appears eBay is my best option given the nature of the item. I have very limited experience using ebay years ago and no experience selling anything online, and I was wondering how refunds work. Even though my item has ""No Returns"" checked off I'm guessing that people can still just call eBay and say they didn't get anything or that they got the wrong thing and then eBay both refunds them and takes my payment away? Is there a way to only allow people within the US to buy my item, and if so, how do I do this? I'm just worried about losing my item and not getting paid given that I have no income and this is kinda a last resort move on my part. Any insight from someone more experienced would be super helpful, thanks for reading this.",13,4,2017-12-31,EBAY,0.04662329703569412,0.8961235284805298,0.05725312605500221
