Ebay,"Need advice on first sale, is it a scam?","Hello, today I have a question about a situation I'm in. This is my very first sale on eBay and I'm not too familiar with eBays interface as well so please go easy on me. 

I put up a pair of shoes on eBay for 30 days on a 'Buy it Now' basis. I'm pretty sure I followed all the instructions eBay gave while listing something, so I let it sit. Then one day some guy hits me up asking if they are still available and if I'll sell for 150$ shipped. I say Yes and to simply send an offer for 150$ and I'll accept. His next message practically ignores what I said and he says ""Are you going to send an invoice? Text me at 12345..."" 

Why didn't he just send the offer on eBay? How do I send an invoice on eBay? Is this a scam? His page is pretty busy with lots of high priced soccer jerseys with signatures on them which was actually pretty cool and he's got a purple star next to the number 548 which I think is the number of transactions he's done.

Ebay,From hero to zero.,"I am pretty new on eBay, have been selling furniture and rugs since the last year. Everything went well and eventually my revenue raised to around 7000$ per month. With the beginning of this year my revenue dropped extremely. The last 31 days I made a staggering 700$... With the biggest inventory and most active listings I ever had active on eBay.

I know from my retail and online store that its normal for a business to have up and downs, but I have never experienced such a blow. This just seems so abnormal that I have been looking for technical problems. Tested my template, checked all settings, checked PayPal...

Ebay,Offering rebate/partial-refund if customer mails back shipping case/container. Thoughts?,"Hey so I've been trying to declutter the past couple of weeks by selling all my old junk I've collected over the years on eBay. I've done fairly well at getting rid of all my small items (DVDs and Bluerays, video games, books, CDs, records, phones, cameras and game systems).

Now I wanna sell off my larger items, like TVs, appliances and especially a lot of old music gear, like electric guitars, speakers and amplifiers, mixers and soundboards etc.

Some of this stuff is pretty delicate, but I don't want to spend a ton on shipping materials and end up pricing my stuff to the point where it's unsellable.

I have 2 really sturdy hard-cases for the guitars, as well as 2 of those big metal suitcases with the padded, foam interiors for transporting delicate equipment and electronics and such.

I'd actually like to keep those for the long term, but I was wondering; would it be a good idea to ship the larger items in those and then give the customer a rebate when they mail them back?

It's not something I've seen sellers on eBay or any other site offer so I don't really have any examples to go by. Is that anything anyone here has seen before? If so, what do you think about it and what do you think would be the best way to word and price that offer?

Ebay,[PSA] Recent Fraud Activity on eBay,"Hi,

So I just wanted to give a PSA about recent fraud activity that specifically our store has been receiving. In fact, in the past week, our store received over $1500 in unauthorized purchases (about 8 transactions). In a year, we might have one MAYBE two cases. In all these cases, the address still comes out as verified, confirmed, and seller protection eligible.

We suddenly became more alert when PayPal caught one of them a couple hours after we shipped it. Out of all these transactions, PayPal only caught one unfortunately. The others may not count though because we started reporting them to PayPal since it was clear they cannot flag these fast enough.

Specifically, I'll be covering scammers who make new eBay accounts (or buy new accounts with a 1 or 2 positive feedback purchases) and have unauthorized access to a PayPal account that they use to make the purchase.

The first hint of unauthorized payment is that the name on eBay doesn't match name on the transaction on PayPal. This is only a hint though and obviously does not immediately mean it's a scam.

Second, check the address. It's always a mail forwarding service. If it is indeed a mail forwarding company at the address, this is a major red flag. 

Yes you can get legitimate buyers doing this, but do NOT ship the item. Contact the buyer immediately through provided email address or phone number. Phone always worked to getting the original PayPal owner. Email were sometimes spoofed or just made up (returned emails as undeliverable).

The above was typically the most common. 

Lastly, a very easily spotted one. The scammer just slaps on an address to the end of the name and keeps the rest of the address intact like so:

John Doe 12345 North St, City2, State2, Zip2

Street

City1, State1 Zip1

Then they message you to send it to the address that was appended to the end of the name instead claiming it was a unintended mistake.

Check the appended address. All of ours were mail forwarding services. We called the provided phone numbers on the PayPal account and confirmed with the PayPal account owner it was unauthorized. (not sure if personal PayPal accounts get customer phone numbers)

**Do NOT rely on PayPal and eBay to be able to properly flag unauthorized purchases. If you even suspect something is wrong, contact the buyer and do not ship the item.**

This sounds like a lot of trouble and honestly it is but it's the right thing to do. All of the PayPal owners were victims of fraud and we did our best to explain the situation and advise them to change any related passwords.",10,23,2017-03-05,EBAY,0.07169049978256226,0.9055176973342896,0.02279183641076088

Ebay,Buyer trying to claim I sent empty box,"Hello - I'm trying to figure out how to proceed with a buyer trying to claim I only sent an empty box. The listing sold for around $100. 

I was selling a galaxy s7 edge for parts only. The screen and the back were broken. I made no promises that anything else worked and I couldn't test anything with the screen not working. I also only included the phone itself. 

When it came time to shio though, I had found the original box so I thought why not include it? 

Turns out it was a bad idea since he claimed the box was empty when he opened it (taking pictures of the empty box as ""proof""). 

I have the shipping info with the weight of the package (which shows there was more than the empty box he is showing in his proof). 

It's going through dispute right now. I've tried to trip him up to admitting he has the phone by so far no dice. He did offer to keep the box for a 50% refund (which in my opinion shows he has the phone because who would pay $50 for a box?). Through the whole process I've maintained that I would offer a full refund if he shipped me back the phone but he ignores those attempts. 

Anyway, I'm wondering how to proceed. I do have $100 shipping insurance. Not sure if seller protection applies, but it's more principle at this point. I want to cover my ass through eBay at least. 

Any advice?",16,5,2017-03-05,EBAY,0.07062170654535294,0.8984140753746033,0.030964190140366554
Ebay,"Did this buyer abuse their ""Buyer Protection"" &amp; Return Policy?","Hi all,
This an ongoing situation I am dealing with, I have been a a longtime seller on Ebay UK .

The Context: 
A buyer paid £180 for an Iphone 6 (used), only issue with the phone was a slight raise on the Left Hand side of the screen - approximately 2-3mm. All of this was clearly and precisely described in the item description with photos of every angle of the phone.

The Problem: 
Within a few hours of receiving the phone, the Buyer indicated that the Touch ID was not working on the iPhone 6. Of course being a long-time seller I was preparing myself to offer a full refund of the paid amount, and for the buyer to ship the phone back. However, before allowing me time to respond and come to an amicable solution, the buyer messages me once more informing me how she has made the decision to take the phone for inspection. The next day, in her own words she describes how the phone was dismantled and inspected internally at an alleged ""apple store"". First of all, this seems a bit odd to me. From my experience one can not simply walk into an Apple Store with a random iPhone and demand for it to be internally stripped down and inspected for damage. Surely you have to book an appointment with the ""genius bar"" and wait a few hours even days for an appointment to become available. Even then if the iPhone is not under Apple Care Warranty you must be expected to pay a fee off some sort? 
However the buyer proceeds to make no indication of any of this in the following email, which was sent less than 24 hours later. This led to me questioning whether she really took it to an ""apple store"" or a third party repair shop. Anyway, this is just food for thought... Regardless, my problem is that not only has the buyer voided their ""buyer protection"" by admitting to the dismantling and altering of the internals/externals of the phone, but secondly that the buyer had left the phone in someone else's care and was not personally there.

Afterwards the buyer then proceeds to email me the next day (as I mentioned before) informing me that the phone is now Water Damaged, and also requesting a ""partial"" refund of £30 in order to allow her to ALSO replace the battery on the iPhone 6. Apparently now after dismantling the iPhone and putting it back together, she decides that the battery is also not holding its charge! The buyer states how if I agree to a partial refund, then this replacement battery will allow them to use the phone and will have no need to ask for a full refund.

As a respectful seller, I oblige and refund them £30 securely via Paypal (through the previous transaction tab) - thinking that the buyer will leave me alone finally. More worryingly, this is the second time that the buyer has opened up the phone and left it in someone else's possession for a prolonged period of time. This time she makes no mention of taking it to an ""apple store"", so one can presume it definitely was a phone repair shop. In their writing via Ebay messenger, they once again tells me how they dismantled the phone again and proceeded to tamper with the internals of the iPhone - changing the battery for an aftermarket product. This time a physical and important component of the iPhone 6 has now been removed and exchanged for an aftermarket copy.

Approximately 24 hours pass, the buyer then proceeds to contact me once more (this is border-lining harassment at this point) stating that the ""new"" battery that they put it does not work adequately or at all (they didn't specify). Due to this they are now demanding a full refund of £180 for the item (after already partially refunding £30). This is where I am currently at, I have just reported the buyer for violation of the ""Buyer Protection"" policy, and will ring up Ebay UK customer service tomorrow in order for them to go through all my emails and verify my claims.

Conclusion: 
I personally believe that the buyer has gravely misused her buyer protection by repeatedly dismantling and altering the item sent. They have this stated in their own writing to me on Ebay, furthermore they also physically changed key components of the phone, and now complains it does not work.

Moreover hypothetically speaking if I were to accept this buyers return request (which I wont), then surely this will also be a clear violation of Ebay's return policy? It explicitly states that the item MUST be returned in the same condition as it was SENT - this would clearly not be the case after everything that has happened!

Ebay,Buyer Claims Item Has Not Arrived After 2 Weeks,"Hi guys, so I received a message earlier today from a buyer stating that their item hadn't turned up. I quickly responded stating that I'd recover my proof of postage and get in contact with Royal Mail to make a lost parcel claim. 

However, upon trying this I realised you need to wait a minimum of 10 working days from the parcels due date to make a claim. Now the parcel was sent 2nd class and was due on the 27th Feb. So 10 working days from this should be the 14th this month. So my main concern is, do I refund her now to be a good seller and risk potentially being scammed or should I make her wait out till I can make a claim? 

I'm thinking along the lines of, what if I refund her and royal mail can't compensate me because she's actually already received the item according to their records and I'm left with nothing. The item was £31 so relatively low value but it's still a problem to me after to going to the effort of selling it, only to lose out entirely.


If it was me and I got asked to wait out a further 9 days or so to get my money back, I'd find it quite annoying. But at the same time, I'm trying to protect myself from being subjected to a potential scam.

Ebay,Potentially scam?,"Potential scam* just woke up, goofed on the title.

What would be a legitimate reason to use an account with 0 feedback and a different name vs one with 200? This sounds like a classic case of future chargebacks.

Ebay,Not sure about this purchaser (possible scam).,"Let me begin by saying that I've bought and sold on eBay quite a bit and generally consider myself to be pretty good at sniffing out a scammer, but I'm not sure about this one.


I listed my old laptop late last night with an opening bid and a buy it now on a seven day listing. This morning I woke up to three emails: one from PayPal, one from eBay, and one from the seller. I checked the source on all of them and they're legitimate. My PayPal account is showing a pending payment for the buy it now price, and the seller sent me an email asking when the item would ship.


Here is why I'm concerned:

* This was the buyer's first purchase/they have zero eBay history.

* The buyer is non-US/unverified according to PayPal.

* The email from the buyer had no punctuation and that (probably stupidly) worries me.

* The laptop sold very quickly, and the opening bid price was a few hundred dollars lower than the buy it now price.

* The shipping address in PayPal is for some third party shipping facility: 2220 Meridian Blvd Ste QA243, Minden, NV 89423-8601

Ebay,"Unknowingly just sold an antique item cheaply, only to find out it's worth thousands more. What to do now??","To make this short, I'm a broke grad student who's desperately in need of money to help pay the bills, and to put forth towards a new laptop that can be used for my research. My mom, seeing me struggling, was kind enough to give me an antique cannon she's been holding onto for 40 years. She said whatever amount I sold it for, I could keep. I always try to research anything I'm selling, and spent hours online researching this cannon in hopes I could get a ballpark estimate on it's worth, but came up with nothing.


I decided to start high (in my mind) and list the starting price as $800 with no reserve. Within one day, it only had 40 views, but 9 watchers. I had a few people asking questions, and then one user asked how much it would take for me to sell it outright. Stupidly, I said $1,000, and he agreed without trying to negotiate the price. That should have been a red flag right there. I set the item to ""buy it now"" for 1,000 and he bought and already paid for it. I have two days to ship it.


20 mins later, a user who had messaged me earlier asked why I removed the listing. I told them it sold, and they said ""well I hope you got a lot for it. There were only 25 of those ever made...I sold one last year with a big crack in it for $3200"".

I think it's shitty to refund the buyer their money just so I can relist the cannon, and was not going to do that until my boyfriend said I really should.

""Failure to provide this information may result in your order being delayed at customs.""  
  
I have never seen this before. Thinking it's some sort of scam, I did some searching and apparently this is a thing. It's been asked on reddit before and some community posts on Ebay.  
  
There's two things I wonder though, that I can't find any information on.  
  
1. Will this be delayed indefinitely until I give the National ID? Or can I just wait longer without giving it? (package hasn't moved for a week)  
2. How do you even give the National ID? There seems to be a complete lack of protocol on this matter.  
  
I can't find any guidelines at all on ebay regarding this specific thing. Thanks in advance for any answers.",2,3,2017-03-07,EBAY,0.04648778215050697,0.9199522137641907,0.03356001898646355
Ebay,Potential Partial Refund Scammer?,"So, I sold a pair of sneaker to a buyer, and sent a message to ask if he is satisfied with the order a week later.

He said that the item is not as described and has defect on it, so he asked for a partial refund. Since I have set up a no-return policy so I gently replied him with a no.

Then he opened a request of return towards me and claim that 'item is not described, seller refuse to do partial refund even it will suffice.'

Then I asked him to send me pictures of defects, but he didn't reply for a few days, right now he said he can't upload the photos because ""they are too big and eBay won't let him to"".

I found a message of him saying that ""Now I looked at your listing and found there's another defect in the picture.""

So here's my questions:

1. If the buyer said something like this, can I say since he didn't check before he purchased, so it's on him?

2. What can I do besides report this buyer for a potential scam?

3. Can I ask him to cancel the return request because the fault is on him?


I think this is weird that a buyer didn't report any problem for like a week. Then I looked up google and think this person might be a scammer.

Am I doing it right? Since I am a student studying aboard so I don't know too much.",20,3,2017-03-07,EBAY,0.0836261585354805,0.8840136528015137,0.03236022964119911

More details: Auction for a necklace started at 99c and had approx 1 day to go, high bid was $7. I figure the seller was unhappy with this price because they cancelled all the bids (by the way, how do I see the reason they logged with eBay) and closed the auction with the reason that the item is unavailable, but now they have a BIN listing of the same necklace for $50, with two of them available.

I can't leave negative feedback or report a problem with the seller because no actual transaction took place between us, but I'm irritated enough that I'm very seriously considering paying the $50 for the necklace just to gain the ability to do both those things.

Ebay,"Buyer opened false eBay claim, didn't return item within time period. eBay closed case in my favor. Now buyer shipped item out (AFTER case closed) and opened a paypal claim. Is this allowed?","trying to make this as short as possible. basically

*  i sold the buyer an item (authentic) and he claimed that they were fake, and opened an ebay claim against me.
* ebay said i'm required to let the buyer return the item, so i did and sent the buyer a tracking number
* buyer didn't ship the item back to me within 5 business days, so i called ebay and they closed the case in my favor
* later that day, buyer shipped out the shoes and opened another claim... but this time on paypal instead.

can i just call up paypal and tell them buyer already missed the deadline to ship the shoes back to me? i know that paypal/ebay claims are separate now, but if it's with the same order/claim, can i not just get it closed? 

not sure what to do here to maximize my chances of winning because the item was sold for $1500 usd and i'm 100% sure he will be sending me fakes of the item back OR garbage instead. should i refuse the package? this has been tricky since he has shipped the shoes back to me using the tracking label (albeit too late according to ebay).

Ebay,"A Warning to Anyone Selling ""intangible"" goods or services.","This only applies if PayPal is used as the payment method, but considering it's the main payment method used on eBay, I believe this applies to eBay in general.

This includes any items for which you cannot provide shipper tracking information. Including any item delivered via electronic means (e-books, gift cards, coupons and promo codes, etc) or any service offered. I found this out the hard way, and confirmed the policy with PayPal customer support... 

If a buyer opens a claim involving a purchase of such item, it is PayPal's policy to automatically side with the buyer, and reverse the charge back to the buyer's account.

The buyer need not provide any details, and the claim can be for anything (in my case the buyer opened an ""unauthorized use of account"" claim, providing no additional detail.) I, however, provided indisputable evidence that the electronic delivery had in fact occurred. But unless you can show that a physical item was delivered to a verified address via tracking info from a physical shipper, they will not even look at any other evidence.

What I think it's the most troublesome is the fact that all the buyer has to do is click a button. ""Unauthorized use of account"" to me would imply that either his account was hacked or used by a family member without permission. In either case, the liability should be on PayPal or the buyer, but in order to simplify and expidite their claims process, there is no seller protection for intangible goods whatsoever, and the judgment is default. The buyer ALWAYS wins the claim.

I was told by a supervisor in PayPal's claims department that this was in fact the case. She said in all that it was not ""safe"" for a seller to accept payment for intangible goods because if a claim is opened, there is no recourse whatsoever, and if a buyer opens a claim, ""yes, they will always win.""

There's two rules of thumb I've learned from this experience, if you are going to sell something to be delivered via electronic delivery (i.e. an ""intangible good,"") be sure to be weary of your buyers feedback, actually look at the reviews. I've seen 20+ 100% positive feedback, but if you check they all came from the same buyer or seller (implying they likely created 2 accounts to ramp up their feedback,) or they are filled with very small purchases in order to get feedback. Either way, if you sense somethings up, cancel their bid/purchase.

***A good way to avoid problem altogether this is to sell anything you plan to deliver via electronic means/digital delivery as a ""bonus"" with something you will actually ship. It can be anything. Sell game download code with email delivery as a ""bonus"" for buying an old penny. (The smaller the better, to avoid shipping charges.)

Anyway, just thought the policy of making default judgements on behalf of the buyer in cases like this was something I should alert the community to.",10,7,2017-03-14,EBAY,0.07935022562742233,0.8948892951011658,0.02576049230992794

Ebay,Just realized I sent an incorrect item to a buyer...almost two months ago. What should I do?,"So basically, what the title says. I was going through my inventory this evening and came across an item that I was certain I sold. I did some investigating and sure enough, I was able to confirm that I sent someone an incorrect model. The one I was holding in my hand was sold/shipped and one that I'm missing is still listed.

My issue is that the buyer received this item on January 17th and hasn't said anything yet. While the items are visibly similar, you would be able to immediately tell them apart upon usage. This also sold to a decent sized company, so I think it's pretty unlikely that someone just didn't open the box yet. I think it's more likely that it just got absorbed into existing tools - this is the type of item that even a small company would have dozens of in all kinds of sizes, kind of like a wrench at mechanic shop. Both the one I sent and the one they ordered are a pretty common size, so I'm positive this company has many more of them - they were probably just trying to stock up on the cheap.

So I'm in a bind - part of me wants to reach out and try to correct the mistake. Another part of me is saying to just leave it alone since it's been so long. Of course, if the buyer reached out to me, I would without a doubt work to correct the mistake. I just don't know if I should stir that pot and potentially open myself up to a headache when there is a pretty good chance the buyer won't notice and will be just fine with the one they got. It was a great deal, regardless of the model.

Ebay,Am I okay to add onto the address by the buyer's request?,"Been a bit worried on this sale. I still can't decide if I am dealing with a scammer or just someone very new to eBay- but I sold a graphics card that is 5+ years old for $50 with free and fast shipping. I had it for But It Now and Immediate Payment Required. Shipping to USA only, buyer restrictions, etc. 

Buyer who made his account today to buy my GPU sent a message in broken English asking when the item would ship- told him it would be tomorrow. He wants me to change a few things in the address- basically add onto an address line #2 an ""AIM-####"" (hiding actual numbers in case it's revealing of anything) and he wants me to add onto his name like a middle name and that same AIM thing on there as well. Aside from those add ons- the address I'm shipping to is the same. Item is shipping though priority mail medium flat rate btw as well. 

Just want to cover my bases- maybe I'm over reacting but I don't want to be out of a card and money.

Ebay,Sold my laptop to yet another nutjob.,"So someone just bought my laptop and paid for it. $1250. Buyer has 73 rating. Account is over 10 years old. However, buyer has no feedback in the last twelve months. I look at the paypal confirmed shipping address. It's TWO addresses bunched up together and poorly formatted, spaced, and capitalized. It also says the sender of this payment is unregistered, whatever that means. I message the buyer to clarify the address. He says its the first one. Then I reformat it to look presentable and ask if this is the address. He says yes ship it. Then an hour later I get another message, also poorly written and bunched up, saying he did not buy a laptop from paypal that this was not his address and his name was not Aleks, Aleks being a random name in front of the confirmed address that I ended up deleting when I reformatted the address. He did not request a refund or to cancel thet order. Just random run-on bunched up sentence. I messaged back and said he needs to clarify what is going on or I won't ship the laptop. I will probably cancel the transaction. I just want to know how ebay and paypal lets yet another nutjob buy my stuff and considers two bunched up addresses as a confirmed address.

Ebay,I was sold fake shoes after being promised I was being sold authentic. Now seller says he will refund me after I return the shoes (and he receives them). Scam?,"The seller has been pretty good at communicating throughout the sale, but the pictures he showed me were a bit sketchy to begin with. I had a feeling the shoes were fake, but I thought since he was haggling and the price was not that low to begin with, the shoes couldn't be fake (stupid, I know).

Now the seller is asking me to show him exactly how the shoes are fake, because he claims he was scammed. He claims he will refund me but that he cannot do so until he receives the shoes back in the mail. This is very sketchy to me, especially because I was just scammed by virtue of this exact seller. I do not want to be double-scammed by way of the seller not refunding me while also getting his shoes back.

Ebay,Buyer returned to me an empty box and PayPal refunded him.,"Sorry for continuing to make so many posts, but I'm pretty much in panic mode now. Long story short, buyer opened a PayPal claim against me (he claims he was sold a counterfeit item which is 100% false). PayPal said that he had to ship the item back to me.

I had my postman hold all my packages at my local USPS office. Went to pick it up today and I have on video (even if PP doesn't accept video evidence) from the second the worker went to get the package. As soon as the worker came back, we had them weigh the box which was 10 ounces. There's absolutely nothing in the box.

I spoke to a PP supervisor, and they were really unhelpful. Kept repeating to me to submit and affidavit and wait for them to decide on the case. Is the affidavit actually enough? Will filing a police report help as well? I'm in full panic mode due to being out $1500 + the item I sold. Scammers suck.

Ebay,Fraudulent PayPal charge -- the person who bought it is the same as the seller?,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask about it, but I figured since it deals with eBay I might as well try.

My sister (who is the owner of the card) managed to look up information on the merchant and the phone number that was used to purchase it (obviously this guy wasn't smart and included their # in the order).

Ebay,Buyer claims package stolen,"Hey everyone, I sold a semi-high priced item ($230). I shipped the item through USPS medium flat rate and it was confirmed through tracking that it was delivered. I also purchased $200 in insurance for the package. The tracking says delivered and left on front porch.

Ebay,(Updated) Partial Refund Scammer,"[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/5xy5bq/potential_partial_refund_scammer/)

Alright, once again eBay sided with the buyer, as what I have heard from reddit and eBay community.

So I called eBay customer service and they said the buyer needs to return the item to me while I pay for shipping.

Therefore I sent a message to the buyer and that's what he sent back to me

&gt;I don't need to talk with you anymore nor do I need your directions. I gave you a chance to make this right and give me a partial refund but you refused. You said you weren't giving me a refund at all, so I did things the right way

As you can see he has 0 intention to communicate with me, but I gently reminded him that if he don't return the item , he wouldn't get refund from me.

What should I do next guys? eBay said this guy should return the item by March 28. I decided to wait for the return and check the item conditions.


Latest Update: This buyer said he won't talk to me anymore, I guess eBay gonna side with me this time, I told him that no return = no refund, but this guy think he already won over me. Well I will just pateintly wait until 28.",17,5,2017-03-19,EBAY,0.03485487401485443,0.9271045327186584,0.03804055228829384

Ebay,"I'm a newish ebay seller, can I get some advice on a return?","I recently sold a UMPC on ebay. I listed it as seller refurbished as I had replaced the screen and HDD. It was in very good condition otherwise. In my auction pictures, I even had a picture of the screen showing the system info (and that windows was indeed activated) and a blurred picture of the Windows COA and serial number. I installed a genuine copy of Windows 7 and activated it using the key in the battery compartment and made sure that all of the drivers and updates were installed. All seemed well at this point.

Anyway, the auction finally ended and some scrub turned out to have the winning bid. He ended up taking over a week to pay. Looking back, I realize that I should have canceled the auction at this point but oh well, it's too late for that. This guy has quite a few negatives as a seller and is at 92% (second red flag?) and just under 200 overall. I had sent him a payment reminder using ebay's template the first and second day after he failed to pay and from the third day forward, ebay automatically opened a case. Well, as the weekend came again, I was getting ready to cancel and relist the auction when I found that the case had been closed and a payment had been recorded. Great. I ship. A week goes by after he gets it and now suddenly I have a return request open from the buyer. This is the first communication I have received from him. Here is a screen grab of the return so far: http://i.imgur.com/N4fmimJ.png

Which finally brings me to my question: How do I approach this? I know I am in the right here unless for some reason windows deactivated while running sysprep (which has never happened to me before with Windows 7) and this guy just can't enter the key to save his life. Should I just eat this return and make it the third item that I've had to pay return shipping on because the buyer had his head up his ass?

I don't know why he should have had to use the key in the first place.

Ebay,"I had a problem with an item I received, contacted the seller, and she offered to PayPal me back some of the money. I feel bad. Should I?","This will sound stupid. I swear I'm not humblebragging about how much of a saintly buyer I am but it's genuinely bothering me.

I bid on a set of used items that all arrived in good condition except one, which had some damage that affected its use. The listing didn't mention it and the photos didn't show it.

I asked the seller (politely) if she by any chance had another one of the damaged item, and she responded promptly to say she hadn't realized it was damaged, apologize, and offer to PayPal me back some money so I could replace it myself. The amount she offered was a little more than it would cost me to replace it, but more than a third of the price I paid for the lot.

Like anyone else, I like money, but I'm starting to feel bad because it wasn't a big issue, she was very helpful and polite during the bidding process, and from skimming posts on this sub I know sellers deal with a lot of shitty buyers. I wasn't trying to scam her and didn't expect her to offer me so much money relative to my purchase price and would have left positive feedback no matter what response she'd given as long as it wasn't rude.

I already left her 5-star feedback and tried to make it as positive as humanly possible but haven't responded to agree to accept her money. Was I a dick for complaining about a small issue?

I sent 2 messages to the seller and they have not replied to any of them.  
Note that I have already requested an order cancellation from the seller on the same day I bought the tablet but it was denied a few hours later (while the message about the tracking number has gone ""unnoticed"" for more than 10 days).  
The postage was defined as ""free"" and the seller DID NOT specify a shipping time.
I also noticed that the seller has been getting a steady stream of negative feedback as being a fake seller or that people haven't received their items.  
Payment was made with my prepaid Mastercard.

UPDATE:  got off phone with eBay, they decided to reverse outcome and I got my money back.

Ebay,I think I was scammed by an unscrupulous buyer,"I sold a gift card on eBay a while ago. A buyer bought it and said I could mail it in a normal envelope to save shipping costs. I checked his feedback and he had 100% positives with over 3k total rating, so I agreed (naive of me apparently). I kept a copy of the number so I could check the balance periodically in case of fraud, although this may be bad practice.

About 10 days after I mailed out the card, the balance was all spent and was $0. A week afterwards the buyer opened a case saying the card never arrived. I called the company that the gift card was for and they said they are unable to track when and where the card was used, so it was only the buyer's word against mine (and my records). He got his refund. To be fair it *is* possible that the card went to the wrong place and whoever received the letter used it.

I wasn't too bothered by the loss of money, but the idea that I got scammed was annoying. I checked the buyer's feedback again and this time looked at his feedback left for others; what I found was very disturbing. 11 of the last 16 feedbacks he left were negative, claiming that the sellers all sent fake items or that the items never arrived.

I want to report the buyer, but all the evidence I have is circumstantial or weak. Is there anything I can do to make a stronger case against him? Or does he get to continue on with his antics?

Ebay,eBay has unprecedented poor customer serivce,"Buyer, and in this case seller, beware. *Don't be upset if you lose your items and your cash.*
On Feburary 19th 2017, I sold a lot of 15 hard drives to a lucky buyer. eBay has done me dirty before, so I try to remember the bad taste that left in my mouth. I ended up eating ~$200. I make sure everything I sell is in perfect working order so my patrons aren't faced with the same situation. I not only endurance tested the drives for this auction, I also SMART tested them several times during. I even went out of my way to augment the process I use, so that it reflects real-world usage. I was more than confident nothing could go wrong.

Fast forward to Feburary 27th 2017 after the listing ended, and the drives were sold. The buyer claimed 5 drives were malfunctioning. The buyer then claimed the package was improperly packed and sealed. He stated he had a video of it being unpacked.  eBay considered this video authoritative despite the fact he had to have opened it before filming (and maybe altered its contents before he took the video). Well, eBay sided with him and issued a refund. This was the finale in a double whammy from eBay support. I thought to myself, ""At least I can finish this refund and get on with life in the Amazon."" Well, that didn't go as planned.

Fast forward to today. I called eBay again and asked them, ""Where are my drives the seller was supposed to ship back? They haven't arrived."" Turns out eBay gave the buyer the wrong address. I checked My eBay only to note my primary address was the correct address. Rochelle from customer service said eBay gave the buyer the wrong return shipping address. Rochelle was nice but unyeilding. She told me I was out of my drives and I owed eBay $380. I said to her, ""So to summarize, we are here because the seller was dishonest, eBay sided with the buyer despite him or her having no credible proof (and me having 7 years of professional experience in the field of IT), and finally eBay incorrectly updated my account thus giving the customer the wrong information."" She replied, ""Yes."" I said, ""Doesn't this sound a bit outrageous and unacceptable?"" She replied, ""Well if I were to give me personal opinion.. well, I can't give my personal opinion."" She knew this was rediculous just as well as I did. I started with my items to sell and ended up giving them away while also acquiring a tab for the auction's price. 

**tldr;** In summary, my last two auctions have costed me over $700 in losses due to bad buyers or sellers and awful customer service. I'm only concerned with this most recent listing. eBay offered a return based on invalid evidence. eBay gave them the wrong address, so now I'm out my drives and money. eBay says there is nothing they can do, appeals are not possible. I also have to pay back the ~$380 since eBay had to refund the buyer... I'm out $380 plus the 15 drives. **I basically took my merchandise, and threw it out of the window.** I then paid a dishonest liar the full cost of the merchandise. **This is what happens when you buy eBay.**

 
Mods: Thank you for allowing me to share this information. I'm trying to build traction on social media since I'm out $700. This is unacceptable behavior. If we do nothing about it, we will all fall victim to this kind of service sooner or later. I'm hoping eBay will notice this thread. If anyone has a better place to post this, please let me know.

Ebay,Ideas for negative feedback reply/rebuttal?,"Hi r/ebay.

I got negative feedback a while ago from a buyer on a $4 A/V cable.

I live in Canada so shipping was $10.89 - thats the cheapest parcel shipping can be. I probably could have sent it lettermail but then you don't get tracking. So i went ahead and listed it at parcel shipping price for around $6. I got a best offer for $4 a few months later, so I took the offer.

The guy paid and I shipped the item.

He emails me a few days later asking if it was normal that the shipping price was $10.89. I replied yes, that is the base price for parcel shipping and he got the same price I had to pay to Canada post to ship the item.


He then leaves negative feedback saying "" AS described BUT CRAZY SHIPPING CHARGES""

I called ebay, but they said it was technically his opinion, he didnt say ""Buyer made me pay way more than shipping actually cost"" or ""Buyer took forever to ship the item"" . So they wouldn't remove the feedback.

I tried reaching out to the buyer by ebay message, but he was less than cordial, he said ""why would I revise the feedback, shipping was so expensive. I have bought other cables and they were free shipping""

I even got his phone number through ebay and called him, he would not revise feedback, even when I let him know I would be willing to refund his shipping costs if he revised the feedback.

I checked his feedback left for others and it seems he leaves negative feedback regularly.

It kind of irks me because I have been on ebay for almost 10 years and up until this point have had 100% positive feedback.

I even went so far as tracking him down on facebook (hes a fat guy who wears a fedora) and made memes of him and laughed about it with my friends to blow off some steam.

I know less than 100% feedback isnt that bad and doesnt really affect sales all that much, but still.

So anyways. I'm ready to leave a rebuttal.

I was thinking something like 

""We reached out the the buyer and he woudnt accept our help""

""Buyer was charged the actual shipping price, we do not mark-up shipping costs""

""Buyer is a total loser...SAD.""

Does anyone have any advice?

Ebay,Luxury Bag Auction - Winner is a New Account,"Hello! Please let me know if this is not appropriate, but just wasn't sure where to turn with this question.

I have listed a luxury handbag, and the winner (and only bidder) was from a new eBay account with no feedback.

She paid via an eCheck, and I'm really nervous about it.

Ebay,"As a seller, where are my rights?","I have a ""buyer"" who obviously had buyer's remorse after purchasing an item from me.  The item in question was over $500 and he filed for return due to the item ""not being as described.""   A bogus claim.  I emailed him immediately after he filed the claim.  The email was very professional, I apologized for the problem he was having and asked him a few questions regarding his claim.  He has not been heard from in a week, so I called ebay to to get some information about the case.  They said that it looks good for me that he hasn't called, so I escalated the case and provided additional pictures that I took of the item while packing it for shipping.  Within hours, ebay seemingly automatically decided in his favor.  WTF?  
  
So the guy files a bogus return, is never heard from again, and ebay finds in his favor after I'm the one following up and providing actual proof?  Again, WTF!!!??  
  
I have 100% feedback and my account has always been in good standing.     
  
What do I do if my item comes back in the same condition and there was literally no reason for this guy to return?  Is there any recourse here?

Ebay,Empty box scam in progress,"I sold an Alexa I received for Christmas on ebay March 1st.  It was delivered, USPS has a delivery confirmation. 

The buyer created a return:

Reason for return

Missing parts or pieces

Comments

I am sorry but the only thing delivered was an empty box left on mailboxes. It was wet ripped and filthy. Not sure what happened. Please investigate as to what happened. Involve insurance if you have to, but this item has not been received.



I fully expect to get an empty box back. Any further communication I sent to him has not been replied to.  He wasn't able to provide any pictures. They are also waiting until the last possible date to advance their claim,  their feedback is private, it's a high value/small/easily flippable item, and frankly based on how I packed it, there's a pretty small chance of it being damaged in shipping.   Unopened Alexa, in a polybag with packing slip....inside of another Amazon box....

I plan on recording the return opening which based on my research may or may not help. Anything else I can do to cover my bases? 



Edit: This is resolved now.  As expected, got an empty box back. When to the post office and talked to a very nice US Postal inspector.  She investigated it, got the weights, and typed up a letter explaining the weights weren't the same.  She emailed it to me and after about 7 phone calls to ebay, they appealed in my favor.

Ebay,"Sold item, received positive feedback, 2 months later received chargeback notice from Paypal. Advice Please.","Hello everybody,

I'm hoping some of you can help me out, as I'm not an experienced ebay seller.

As the title states, I sold an item just under 2 months ago. I received the payment, sent the item, received positive feedback, gave positive feedback etc. etc.
Then today I received a notice from paypal stating that the buyer has requested their financial institution reverse the payment because ""The buyer stated they did not authorise the payment"". 

I thought I would be covered by Paypals seller protection since I obviously sent the item and the buyer was happy enough to leave positive feedback, but the email from paypal states if they don't receive a reply in 10 days they will automatically debit the funds from my paypal balance.

The item sold was even a best offer received, if this truly was credit card fraud would the buyer be sending offers out? And even if it was am I liable?

Ebay,Solution to return scammers ruining ebay,"I actually had this idea a long time ago, mentioned it to one of my relatives. For some reason the idea came up again as I was thinking about selling on ebay but then decided against it due to their buyer siding practices.

Ok, as many know there is a large amount of scams that go on by returning items ""not as described"" when in reality the item was there, but the buyer did not want to pay for it. This...is criminal activity, yet ebay is endorsing it.

I do have the solution for it, and if ebay wants to continue to operate in the future I think it will have to be implimented. The idea being ""Ebay Item Verification"". Now, the concept behind this is rather simple, but implimenting it would be a challenge as it would require physical locations.

Ebay Item Verification would have small ebay stores that become a part of the shipping process that take custody of the items. Before taking custody of the items and accepting shipping payment, ebay employee would verify contents of said package and if necessary test the product via means of plugging it in or whatever tests would prove it is as specified. This process would disqualify a few items I'm sure due to the burden of proof being too difficult. 

Verified items would be ebay insured at that point (seller no longer at fault for not matching description. This could be combined with retail stores in existence already like Fedex and UPS, but an added function.

Items that are commonly counterfeit/knockoff could prove to be difficult in identification process and might altogether be easier to disallow them ""verification"".

It says that I should contact the seller for shipping information/a label/something, and I did so on the first day, but the seller isn't responding for 3 days now, and I can't ask Ebay to step in nor do anything else but put in a tracking number for the sd card.

Am I supposed to take my usual postal service and send it back to him, even tho the place he sent from was Frankfurt and his shipping address shows Spain (and has no name or anything tied to it).

If so, how do I know that I'll get refunded for the shipping that I paid for the transfer along with the regular refund, he could just pretend he never got it even tho I sent it back and could screw me twice, he's extremely irresponsive with replied as it is :(.

Ebay,Buyer keeps emailing every hour to ship faster. Receives item. Now keeps emailing every hour that product is damaged and wants a refund.,"This is more funny than anything. 

First buyer made two orders for the same product, then cancelled one of them while emailing to ship, ship, ship while also emailing to cancel the second one. 

I'm guessing the hope was that I would ship by mistake while he got his money back for both orders. 

It's not that difficult to figure out what's refunded and what's not. 

So he finally makes a third order. Ship faster emails every hour start coming. Item arrives today and it's ""damaged"". 

It's a multipack of little cereal boxes that he bought for $8. 

Rather than accuse anyone of anything or ask if each and every box of cereal has somehow spontaneously combusted, I apologize and ask for a photo of the damage. Buyer cannot take photo. 

I apologized again and sent a return label which will end up costing more than just refunding the buyer and letting them keep their ""damaged"" cereal.

Ebay,"""My mobility is limited - please give me a partial refund""","I recently got a message from someone saying that

1) The item arrived in perfect physical condition and is undamaged from shipping.

2) The unit has functions A, B, and C. Function C does not work. I tested it beforehand, but of course cannot prove that it doesn't work now that they have it.

3) Actually, the unit DID get damaged during shipping (""&lt;x&gt; and &lt;y&gt; were loose in the box"".) The item was wrapped in about 5 layers of bubble wrap. It is physically impossible for anything to be loose in the box.

4) They wanted to ""contact me before leaving feedback"".

I sent: ""I'm sorry to hear that. Please open a return if you are not happy with the item.""

They responded with: ""My mobility is limited - please give me a partial refund of $15.""

How do I handle this? It's a $50 item and still within my 14 day return window.

Possible solutions I've considered:

A) Ask for pictures/proof of non-working functions. I'm not buying their story since there's obviously something fishy going on (""arrived in perfect condition undamaged from shipping"" then ""some parts were loose in the box"".) Not even sure what my move would be if they could prove it. Partial refund? Everyone has advised me against that, but I'm open to counter-arguments.

B) Tell them I will only accept a return.

Ebay,"Won an auction for an iPad, received a random necklace in the post 2 days later. Should I be worried?","I won an auction for an iPad on Thursday morning. The seller hasn't updated the listing to say it's been shipped but today I received a package via tracked mail - not containing an iPad but some cheap jewellery. I haven't ordered any jewellery from anyone and seems like a strange coincidence that it arrives just after I buy this iPad.

&amp;nbsp;

According to the tracking it was shipped the same day as the auction. I've contacted the seller just to ask if they had shipped the item, but haven't got a reply.

&amp;nbsp;

It seems if this was a scam, why would they bother sending some jewellery by recorded post? I've checked other items the seller has sold and it's been a few other iPads this week. No jewellery, so I can't see how there's been a legitimate mixup.

&amp;nbsp;

Should I be worried?

**Edit:** I've started a Refund Case. I've contacted the seller and they have replied saying the never sent necklace package and the had sent the iPad today. He's asking for me to close the case. I've apologised to him if he didn't send it, and I'd close the case when the iPad arrives. I don't want to negatively affect him if he genuinely is legit. Are there repercussions for him if he's a genuine seller and I don't close the case until I get the iPad?

**Edit 2:** After repeated emails from the seller asking me to close the case, he has said he has contacted Royal Mail and placed my parcel on hold until I close the case or issues a refund. The one he allegedly posted on Saturday.

I contacted Royal Mail myself to ask if this was even possible. They confirmed that no, it's is impossible and also illegal to intercept post once it is sent. Wondering how to proceed from here. 

Obviously I want the refund but I somehow doubt he's going to give it that easy if (as it seems) he is a scammer.

**Edit 3:** He has offered a partial refund. Half now and half when he 'gets the item back from the Post Office'. Obviously I have rejected this offer.",37,15,2017-03-25,EBAY,0.07076973468065262,0.9008009433746338,0.028429321944713593

Ebay,I think my seller is going mad.,"So I bought few items from one seller, asked before hand if he combines shipping, he sure did, everything goes well, I say im ready to get the invoice and BAM. The postage should be around 5 euro and he sends me an invoice for 40 euro. Mind you even if he didnt combine the shipping the shipping wouldnt be more than 12 euro.

So I write a msg to him and ask what's going on? I guess maybe he missclicked. His response was ""i don't accept your buyings, because adam pacuk is ja buyer who don't pay. Ebay was informed !""

At this point I question sellers sanity. What is adam pacuk, what does it have to do with me and not accepting my ""buyings""? What can i do now?


#edit
Update: He is willing to ""cooperate"" and asks 20 euro for shipping, claiming it's the real price now. But as I mentioned before even if he didnt combine the shipping each item cost 4 euro. So if combined shipping just means ""pay more"" then I dont get it at all. Isnt there a way to force seller to ship it for a price we all agreed for? Because this is getting ridiculous.

#final edit?
Well, it looks like the seller think Im using multiaccounts and dont want to pay for his items because person with adress close to mine did this to him.

Ebay,Problems using exclude word on different searches,"Hello,  
Lately I noticed a bug in Ebay search that is extermly annoying.

When you conduct a search in some categories (for example Antiques, Books) and try to filter using the minus symbol (which is exclude word), it always reduces many results, even when it shouldn't.

When I search the term ""african mask"" I get 2,233 results.  
When I search ""african mask -decor"" I get 1,328 results.  
When I search ""african mask decor"" I get 32 results. This actualy means that there are only 32 results that match with that added word ""decor"". So why does removing ""decor"" removes 905 results?

Ebay,eBay LPT: Optimize Your Shipping/Packaging!,"Okay, so this is going to sound like common sense to most higher volume sellers, but I feel like it took me way too long to figure out. I figured I'd make a post in case others are on the fence about investing in packaging and give them an idea of what it looks like. Also, this sub gets super negative with everyone talking about getting scammed or how much they hate eBay, I thought we could use this thread to talk about any other positive tips or tricks sellers have picked up.

In any case, my story - I started an eBay seller account around February of last year with the initial thought that I would just sell a few items a month and make some quick, easy money. I really didn't want to invest too much into it and packaging was certainly the last thing on my mind. After my first couple sales, I realized scrounging around for boxes and bubble wrap was just not cutting it...too time consuming and some of my packages looked terrible. I took a look at boxes from Staples and a few other places and found them to be ridiculously expensive. That, combined with the fact that most of my packages were coming in around 18-20oz led me to simply order free USPS priority mail boxes, specifically the 12"" x 14"" x 4"" model. It was a little longer then I needed but it was the smallest one I could find that was 12"" x 4"" and they're free so whatever. They looked good, held the items, and I ended up using them for the next 8 months or so.

Over that time, my little eBay thing kind of took off. I went from one transaction a week, to one a day, to two or three a day. I was fine using the USPS Priority boxes but I realized I was spending anywhere from $7-$12 to get these things mailed, not to mention the fact that I was flying through bubble wrap. I decided to take an hour or two and get this straightened out, with the goal of getting my boxes under a pound so I could ship First Class. Went online searching for the perfect box and found [these guys](https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-1725/Indestructo-Mailers/12-x-4-x-4-Indestructo-Mailers). I went ahead and ordered 100 of them - at the time $83 for boxes seemed ridiculous, but I was going to give it a shot. I got them in, got my first order, packaged it up, and it weighed a perfect 14oz. Only $3-$4 to ship. And I was able to cut the amount of filler material I needed by more than half.

Ran through those first 100 boxes and now I'm ordering them 500 at a time (at least, I've made one order of 500). Again, $335 is way more then I wanted to spend on boxes, but at that quantity, I'm only spending $0.67 each. If my average shipping cost is $3.50, then I'm at roughly $4.20 a box and saving anywhere from $3-$7 per transaction. If the average saving is $5, I'll put an extra $2500 in my pocket over the course of those 500 boxes. Not only that, but they look great and save me on filler material and tape.

It took me way too long to make this realization...At first, I kind of knew I could save a couple bucks, but it didn't seem like much and my products were already profitable, so it wasn't very important. 1-2 hours spent thinking about it on a Saturday afternoon, and a small initial investment has made shipping so much easier and made me real money. I can't tell you how many times I order stuff from eBay from decent sized sellers and the item shows up in giant boxes stuffed with bubble wrap or newspaper. All that filler costs money, adds to the weight, and tends to make the package look terrible. I also get stuff shipped to me in everything from shoe boxes to cereal cartons. I get why small sellers do that, but If my item shows up in a crappy box clearly fished out of the garbage, I'm immediately worried about the item inside. It's usually fine, but initial reaction is disappointment and if you have a picky buyer, you're going to be more likely to get a complaint. I want buyers to be stoked when an item shows up and I think good looking shipping cartons is one way to do that. I'd say if you ship more than a hundred items a year, optimizing shipping is one of the easiest things you can do increase profit and make buyers happy.",15,5,2017-03-28,EBAY,0.05710195377469063,0.9098213911056519,0.033076588064432144

Ebay,Buyer keeps pushing payment date but claims it's my fault...,"Hi, I'm not really sure what to do here, I've only been a seller for a couple of weeks (primarily just to get some stuff out of my house) so this is a pretty new situation to me.

* The auction ended on 3/18.
* This was probably my 8th or 9th sale, the only one where the buyer didn't immediately pay after winning. I sent an invoice on 3/20 after not seeing a payment. I suppose I should have done this earlier but I didn't realize.
* A day or so later I get a message from the buyer saying that he would complete the transaction on 3/24. I thought it was weird that he'd make me wait when he knew payment was due, but whatever. I'm not in a particular hurry.
* 3/24 comes and goes, I start looking up the unpaid item process to see what my options are.
* 3/26 I open an unpaid item case, eBay says a message is sent to the buyer, but there was no response and no payment.
* 3/28 I send him a message letting him know that once the four days that the case requires are up, if he hasn't paid I'm going to close the case and relist the item.
* This morning he sends me an irate message telling me that it's my fault because of my poor communication, that he was waiting for me to respond to his statement that he'd pay on the 24th. I didn't respond to it, I guess I should have, but it wasn't a question. It was just, ""I'll be completing the transaction on 3/24. Thanks."" He goes on about my poor business ethics, then claims that since I didn't contact him until 3/28, he won't pay for the item until 3/31.

So, the case can be closed on 3/30 if he still hasn't paid, and I'm wondering if this would be the proper course of action. There's no guarantee that he'll actually pay on 3/31, since he claimed he'd pay on 3/24 and that never happened.  Of course, if I don't close the case and he does pay, I'm sure my seller rating will suffer (and of those previous sales I mentioned, I only received feedback from two users, so that's a big hit to my rating).

You can no longer sell items on eBay
Your seller performance is not meeting the minimum requirements to sell on eBay and your seller level is now Below Standard in the US seller performance standards program.
You won't be able to list and sell items on eBay anymore.
Our selling standards are in place to help make sure sellers deliver a great customer experience. They measure whether buyers were satisfied with your items and your customer service.
What this means:
If you had any active listings, they've been ended, and any selling fees paid for those items will be credited to you. Any existing selling subscriptions have also been cancelled.
If you recently sold items that you still need to fulfill or ship, please do so as soon as you can.
You'll still be able to see any recently sold items in My eBay, send and receive messages, and buy items on eBay.

I called twice, earlier in the day I got what seemed like the 9-5 team telling me that I have 6 defects (for selling an item and canceling and REFUNDING immediately afterwards, was out of stock) which one of those defects comes to its 1 year expiration next week, he mentioned that it should be fine by then and I could sell again, so I just wanted to confirm again so I called several hours later and got an overseas kind of support where the lady ends up telling me my account has been suspended indefinitely.

I'm super devastated I've given 10 years plus to this company, and even over the phone the last was telling me there are other selling platforms I could use and I was just crying.

Ebay,After 8 years I've received my first Negative Feedback; what does this mean for me going forward?,"So I sold some stuff last week, and one of the buyers got really mad because the packaging was slightly damaged (there was a dent in the plastic bubble that could easily be popped back into place). He left some insulting feedback, and messaged me some threats, which is... yeah, okay, I suppose he's entitled or whatever, but I kind of regret giving someone like that my return address.

Anyway, this is the first negative feedback of received and I'm kind of curious what it means going forward. My feedback score went from 100% (obviously) to 92.5% (out of 215 total feedbacks)... do you think that will make buyers less inclined to buy stuff from me in the future? I've got a bunch of old HDMI cables I wanted to try selling, for example--would I be better off giving those to a friend to sell from an account with something like 100% feedback out of 10 total feedbacks?

Basically, I kinda just want to know if this negative feedback has screwed my account.

And I'm also confused about how the score is calculated. Just at face value, it seems like 1 negative feedback and 214 positive feedbacks should yield a rating of 99.5%. So clearly things are weighted, but how?",20,3,2017-03-29,EBAY,0.0747300237417221,0.8666350841522217,0.058634933084249496

Ebay,What are my options?,"I am a newer seller on eBay; I sold a PS3 controller last week which was tested and in great condition. All of the buttons and joysticks worked how they are supposed to. 

The day the package was delivered I got a message from the buyer accusing me of sending him a controller that doesn't hold a charge and asking if the reason my return policy is set to ""no returns"" is because I knew of this problem going into the sale.  I asked the buyer for more info ( how long exactly does it stay on after a charge, etc. ) he responded about 30 minutes later saying he was sorry and that it does in fact hold a charge, it was just dead and needed to remain plugged in for more than 10 seconds to sync to his console...

Skip forward another few days.. I get another message from him saying he is having trouble with the joysticks not functioning as they are supposed to. He said he played with the controller for two days ""hoping the problem would go away"" before messaging me. He hinted at wanting a return. I have not responded to this message and have not heard anything back from him. I am concerned that he is either trying to send me back an item that was not the one he had received or something along those lines. 

He has not left any feedback good or bad so I am nervous that he is going to leave a bad feedback which will severely drop my percentage. What do I do going forward? Just accept the return to protect my score and eat the cost if it is in fact a different controller? Or do I sit this one out and see how it plays out? Are there other options I am not seeing?

Ebay,Customer claims Item is broken...,"Hey guys!

First time posting in this sub. Basically, I sold a computer keyboard to someone overseas (through Ebay, shipped to their global distributing center), and when it arrived, the customer said the box was damaged (sent me pictures), and that the keyboard wasn't working properly.

When I sent the keyboard, there was literally nothing wrong with it, with the exception of some cosmetic wear. All the keys worked, the little touchpad worked, etc. 

The customer has been sending me quite a few messages, and I sent him a list of things to try. He said he tried all of them, and it did not work. I then asked him to contact the keyboard manufacturer, and ask them for help, as they have more knowledge then me. He did, and said it would cost about $70 for them to fix it, which is about what he paid for the keyboard. 

I told him I would contact USPS, and that he should contact his mailing service as well, however, the buyer didn't purchase shipping insurance (not sure if possible on ebay), so I'm not sure what either company can do. 

I haven't heard anything from USPS, and it doesn't seem that he has contacted his local shipping company. I am getting quite a few messages from the buyer asking for updates, when I can't even give him anything, since I am not receiving responses. What should I do in this situation?

Ebay,Buyer paid again after refund for item 3 months later...,"Shut down eBay anchor store on 15 DEC, shipped all paid for items up until 20 DEC with daily reminders to pay and our last ship date.

Sold off all the inventory, racks, shipping supplies for a surprising profit and moved to our new home. We kept more than enough in our paypal account to handle any eBay invoices or claims and as I keep debating getting back into eBay, I monthly do a scan of the mail accounts. 

Turns out one item was paid for out of that order on 17 MAR which was refunded on 22 DEC, with the shipping inflated to include the entire refund.

I gave a call to eBay mostly out of morbid curiosity how this could happen, and it turns out because of the unpaid item reminder case, the transaction can never be cancelled.

I refunded again through paypal (certainly don't want to mess with any future use of the account if I do reopen at some point), and supposedly eBay took steps at their end to actually cancel the transaction this time so it can't be paid again (I won't hold my breath...), but thought I'd share.",0,3,2017-03-30,EBAY,0.06103704869747162,0.9043146371841431,0.034648340195417404

Ebay,Suspicious of buyer's request for refund,"As a longtime seller/buyer on eBay, I've seen attempts here and there from members trying to pull a fast one which I've typically been able to resolve - but this one has me stumped.

Order of events:

-Purchased a necklace, was too long and decided to sell it. After trying it on, put it back into small ziploc-style bag, price tag still on it.

-Buyer (w/1000+ feedback) ordered my necklace which is unique enough that it's not a common piece, for ~$60

-I took the ziploc-style bag, questioned if i should take the price tag off and decided not to because it looked like the buyer was getting a good deal since it said $96 and left it on while I packed it into a larger padded envelope.

-I dropped it in one of the USPS blue boxes and over a week went by before any scans showed up on tracking. Finally it was scanned in two states over as en route

-Buyer received the item, and emailed me telling me the necklace was broken. Specifically, they stated that half of the chain was missing and after some back and forth she sent an image which showed just the necklace pendant and one side of the chain, the other side was missing and there was no price tag.

-I then asked her to send a follow-up image of the packaging as I do not understand how it would be possible for half of the chain to be missing without the envelope being shredded. She obliged and sent me another picture of the necklace and the exact package I had sent the item in, in perfect condition.

Now I am stuck in a tough situation, but more so than having to give a refund, I'm trying to figure out who to suspect here.

Possibilities:

A) In the week-long period between dropping the envelope in the blue box and it being scanned a few states over, is it possible that someone at the USPS did something with the item? But why just steal half a chain? It's gold, but not ACTUAL gold.

B) The buyer, although seemingly upstanding, had a broken necklace they wanted to replace and are now trying to pass it off the broken one as the one I sent to get a free necklace.

C) Half of a necklace was magically stripped off from the other half by the forces of nature, slipped out of a ziploc bag, squeezed out of the adhesive closure of the padded envelope and is somewhere between my home and the buyers home.

What is the appropriate action to take assuming that it's the most obvious choice (B)? Even with all of my experience dealing with nefarious buyers and sellers, I don't see how I can win this one. Would a threat of police action scare even the most crooked of crooks??",4,3,2017-03-30,EBAY,0.041394226253032684,0.9156462550163269,0.04295949265360832
Ebay,"Any actual ebay employees here?

He obviously shipped it knowing that tracking info was paramount to my case.  

I filed a case with ebay saying I never received the item, and it auto-closed saying ""tracking shows the product was shipped to you.""  Well...no it doesn't.  It shows it was shipped to my zip code, but not my house.

They say I can appeal with a police report, but is that really something I have to do to get eBay to look into this further?  I can't re-open the case saying I didn't get the item as described because the case for that item has already been closed.

I sold a Fitbit for parts &amp; not working 6 days ago. The buyer purchased, paid, and after 6 hours sent a message asking details about the item, and asked if they could cancel, as they didn't read the description.

I write them and tell them I test all my games but don't play through the entirety of them and I apologize for the inconvenience. I tell them I will refund them, just go ahead and open a request up. 

They write back asking for a partial refund. I honestly didnt know you could do a partial through ebay, I thought it was just through paypal and didnt think I would be protected so I told them that. (I still don't know how to even do it anyhow)

They write back and say they really like the game and can I just give a partial. I haven't wrote back but why would you want the game if it freezes? I feel like the next message will be feedback extortion. Kind of hoping it is so I can be done with them and wont have to worry about a negative.

I also seen the post a couple weeks ago where a buyer said the shoes she bought were to small but just wanted a partial refund. Why would you want a partial refund on shoes that don't fit? 

In my case, I'm not going for it. I'd rather pay for the return and give the refund than to be scammed by someone trying to squeeze a few dollars out of me. 

Guess this post didn't go anywhere and it's not something you can really be on the look out for but just wanted to post about it.",7,3,2017-03-31,EBAY,0.0398680679500103,0.9192227721214294,0.040909238159656525
Ebay,Suspicious buyer,"I just received a message from a buyer on ebay regarding an item I sold on March 16. The item apparently arrived broken to the buyer. It arrived on March 22 and they just notified me today, March 30. I am trying to find more information regarding the address, as I think it is a location of a third-party shipping company. The buyer has sent photos of the box that clearly has been re-taped because it has brown tape, which I did not use. Also my label has been covered with another label. Any thoughts on what I should do?",7,3,2017-03-31,EBAY,0.09194379299879074,0.8831546902656555,0.02490144781768322
Ebay,Someone please advice.,"Me and my wife seem to have no more options and we don't know what to do. She has an eBay account that's in great standing. Over a month ago we posted my computer on her account for auction WITH free ground shipping , we had bidders etc, and this guy in Hawaii won. He paid us and we shipped via USPS Ground from NJ to Hawaii. The package left California on a ship and tracking didn't update for over 21 days. The buyer filed a claim for a refund and ebay favored towards him cause there was no update for 3 weeks. He was refunded. Then packaged finally was updated in tracking and delivered. 

That's just the beginning.. When we shipped we bought insurance and Signature Confirmation. It was signed for when it was delivered. So we contacted ebay to find out what's going on. They tell us to contact the buyer and request payment or ship the computer back. We did and waited 72 hours with no response. EBay than contacted him with no response. We just got off the phone with a appeals agent, according to eBay we can't file an appeal, ebay won't pay us and if he doesn't pay us or send the computer back we are screwed. It seems our only option is to file a small claims case, which we will do, but how can this happen? Does anyone have any suggestions or help or anything that can help us? 

I don't understand why ebay can't pay us and go after the buyer themselves. Where did all the seller protection go? How does a large company just say your screwed, you won't get your computer or payment (which was $850). 

This has been hands down the worst experience I've ever had with selling online with a large company.

Edit: Ebay has the option to select USPS Ground from NJ to Hawaii.",23,3,2017-03-31,EBAY,0.04967154935002327,0.9199681282043457,0.030360329896211624
Ebay,Feedback Question?,"Does positive feedback help your items get more views, and help it rise on the search results page?",2,3,2017-03-31,EBAY,0.01266933511942625,0.7990260124206543,0.1883046180009842
Ebay,"Newbie seller, buyer requesting refund","So I sold a Samsung Galaxy S3 to this person approximately 34 days ago and today I received this message from them:

 ""Thank you for the quick delivery with the phone, I didn't use it for a while after receiving it as I was sorting out a sim card contract, it worked fine for the first week of using and then it froze on the start up screen. I purchased a new battery, but unfortunately it is still frozen on start up screen, have tried to re-boot and a few other methods, but nothing working, is it possible to get a refund?""

I bought this phone brand new at time of release, used it for a couple of years then my Mum used it for a while. I checked multiple times before selling/listing if there were any errors with it and there was nothing. 

I would like to know the best course of action as I'm quite new to selling. There was no returns accepted on the item.",7,3,2017-03-31,EBAY,0.02767149731516838,0.9075733423233032,0.0647551566362381
Ebay,Return closed,"Hey, I sold one pair of shoes and the buyer received and said that they are not as described and are fake. he opened a return case saying that they are reps etc and I offered a full refund In return label but he said that he will not return them and let me ""scam"" other people. Nor will he wast his time and money sending back. He then closed the case after I offered the return label. He has messaged me saying he's done it 4 times and won everyone. Can he still revive refund as he closed it? PayPal has reinstated the money they took out whilst his case was opened and closed.
