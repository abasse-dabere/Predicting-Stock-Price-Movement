Ebay,Leaving neutral feedback after a refund,[deleted],11,6,2016-04-01,EBAY,0.24334608018398285,0.6944454908370972,0.0622083842754364
Ebay,Planning for the unforeseen - eBay should have an option to help.,"I was just reading the thread on this forum [Leaving neutral feedback after a refund](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/4cuh9b/leaving_neutral_feedback_after_a_refund/), and while it may have absolutely nothing to do with that situation, I started to again think about what would happen if I was unexpectedly unable to take care of my online business.

With a brick-and-mortar store, people can *see* that there's a business that needs to be addressed.  But in the midst of confusion and unexpected urgencies, I can pretty much guarantee that eBay and our other online businesses would not be.

Order fulfillment, outstanding fees, payments received, open listings, buyer communications - who's going to take care of these?  Who would even know where to start?

I'm not saying that's the reason /u/watt_way hasn't heard anything from their seller, but it *could* be.  And if so, I'm sure the people trying to clean up the account are not concerned with feedback; they would just want to get things settled quickly.

eBay should have an option to ""settle"" an account.  There should be some way to contact eBay, give them some kind of previously determined information, and have eBay take care of the rest, ie, contact buyers, refund money, close listings, etc for ALL accounts the user has at one time.  Then send a summary to the family/executor/administrator so that they can follow up on anything outstanding at another time.

Of course, that's all a pipe dream, and what we CAN do right now is to make sure that account information for all online selling and banking accounts is written down and stored safely with other important papers.  Which is something I'm going to do today.",6,5,2016-04-01,EBAY,0.038172006607055664,0.9326475858688354,0.029180439189076424
Ebay,Processing a return as a seller,"I sold a dress on 3/16 and she now wants to return it because it did not arrive when expected. Before she made her purchase, she made counteroffer after counteroffer and we finally agreed on $35 with free shipping. She asked me if she would recieve it by Thursday 3/24 , which I said she should. Item arrived to her on 3/28 and she is saying that I sent the item too late? Estimated time on the listing says 5-9 business days, and I got it to her in 8. I let her know that she could have asked me for expedited shipping. In my listing it states that return shipping will be paid for by buyer. The total amount she paid was $35 with free shipping. I have a few questions:
 

1. Can you return an item in this case?    
2. Would I have to return the full $35 because shipping was at my expense?    
3. Can I charge a restocking fee if it's not directly mentioned in my listing?

Ebay,Shipping too expensive for eBay?,"Hey guys, 

I am new to selling on eBay, and I have some inventory that could not sell on Amazon that I want to get rid of. I will be fulfilling everything myself. They can fit in a small 4x7 or 5x7 bubble mailer, and one item weighs 1.2 ounces and the other 5.25 oz. I did a calculator on USPS to see how much it would cost from NY to CA for the 1.2 oz package and the lowest amount was $2.70. This seems like a lot for a small package. Is there a different/cheaper way of doing this?

Thanks guys.

P.S While I am asking questions, does eBay make you put a slip inside of the package? Or can I prepackage the item and throw a label on the outside?",8,5,2016-04-01,EBAY,0.026852713897824287,0.906000018119812,0.06714723259210587

Ebay,Ebay bug causing gift card balances to be wiped randomly during checkout,"Just wanted to warn everyone that there is a known bug within the way Ebay processes gift cards that can cause a purchase to fail and yet still remove the value from your Ebay gift card.  It happened to me with a $25 gift card and when I called the Ebay rep was well aware of it.  I gave him the gift card number and he is going to forward it to the group that handles gift cards.

Might be a good idea to check your gift card's balance before and after a transaction.

Ebay,"USPS likely lost my package, best action?","Last week, I bought a $500 gift card with priority shipping with USPS. After purchase, I got no information for about a week, then got the tracking number only this Monday.

Tracking information says package arrived ""delivered to individual"" previous Friday. Immediately asked all housemates, no one got the package. Waited one day, sent seller a message. Visited post office, left them an email. Friday, USPS responded, saying package was left at [not my address].

Well shit, I went to the address (4 apartments and 2 businesses), no one has seem it. Went to post office again, say they would look into it, but I have little hope now.

I think the package was only insured for $50. How should I proceed as the buyer? I don't know who's getting screwed here, so it's probably me?

Thanks for any advice.

EDIT: According to some of you, I'm being scammed. Going to try to get it back, but it looks like my kindness just cost me $500

EDIT 2: after visiting the address and the post office several times, I was instructed by eBay to file ic3. After the ic3, the case was ruled in sellers favor (despite what I was told by the first eBay agent). I called eBay again the next day with no new information and got an agent who was able to immediately appeal the case and refund me (a one-time courtesy money back guarantee). He also requested that I go ask USPS for a printout of the shipping details associated with the tracking #. I did and confirmed that the seller sent to a wrong address in my area code on purpose.

All-in-all, it was a lesson learned for two weeks of hassle and heavy stress. I have not lost faith in eBay since it was resolved relatively painlessly.",22,4,2016-04-02,EBAY,0.07553454488515854,0.8845819234848022,0.03988349437713623

Ebay,eBay is making my pictures look grainy,"I recently got a Nikon D3300 camera to take pictures of my laptops that I sell on eBay. Before I got the camera I really had no experience with DSLRs, so there was a learning curve trying to get my laptop images to look good. After about a month of playing around with it I was starting to get some really high quality shots and they look great on my computer. The problem is when I upload them to eBay they become grainy and lose a lot of quality. I have no idea why it is doing this and started to accept that my images look subpar on eBay's photo gallery. 

I then took pictures of the 18-55mm kit lens that came with my camera because I never use it after I upgraded to a 50mm lens. I took these pictures in the same exact place that I take my laptop pictures, which is on a white piece of poster board with 4 diffused lights shining at all different directions. I then went to edit them in light room and photoshop like I usually do with my laptops and made the final edits. The only noticeable difference I did with shooting/editing the lens photos compared to my laptop photos is that the lens photos required more cropping since it is much smaller than a laptop. 

These lens pictures look great on eBay. They look good on the computer and look good on the app. None of my laptop pictures look this good on eBay even though they look great in photoshop. So I started to think it was the image resolution because a lot of my laptops were around 4000 X 1500 (Not exact, but my point is there was a large spread between the height and width) and my lens pictures were about 2700 X 2200. I had been shooting in RAW, so I thought that maybe if I started shooting in FINE set on small which produces a image that is 2992 X 2000 that then my images would appear more clear on eBay. However, they don't. I'm now really frustrated and lost on what to do.",3,2,2016-04-02,EBAY,0.027324117720127106,0.9119873046875,0.06068853661417961

Ebay,"A buyer tried to scam me w/ fake paypal verification emails when trying to buy a decently expensive item. I opened a case, called ebay multiple times, and they won't help me. Recently they pulled money out of my bank account for a percentage of the sale, and I'm hurting financially. I need advice.","I was selling an item on ebay last month. The bidding got aggressive, with about twenty people willing the buy it. At the last minute, a new buyer swept in and stole the bid. They contacted me, saying to send them a paypal money request. After that message, I didn't hear from them for about 3 days. Then suddenly, they reply saying the sent the payment, and to check my email for verification. Sure enough I find paypal emails verifying the money. Reading through them, I noticed the amount that was sent to me almost $100 over the price I asked for. I opened up my paypal only to find that there was no payment after all. Revisiting the emails, which were decorated with paypal logos, I noticed the actual service paypal email address was different that previous ones I've received from the official paypal address, when selling other items; the format of the emails even looked different than my earlier ones. At this point, I filed a case through ebay, sent the email address to paypal, and replied to the buyer. 

Another day goes by, and there is still no response from ebay or the buyer. So I thought I would just relist it or second chance the offer, but sure enough I hit my seller limit for the month. I decided to finally call ebay about the issue. After sitting on hold for 50 minutes, I asked if someone could maybe look into this case for me, or at least raise my seller limit for the month, so I could resell the item. I was rudely told that they weren't going to raise the cap, and that I should wait for the case to go through.  

Now, I'm sitting here almost a month later, unable to pay my cell phone bill because I just dumped $600 on utilities, rent, and other bills, and ebay charged a percentage of the item sale, which is more than the amount they said they would charge me on my account page, to my bank account, so it went negative and I got a fee from the bank for the negative balance.  

I don't know what to do. I never marked that I received payment from the buyer. I even reported the buyer and called ebay over the issue, but they still charged my account like the item actually sold! Is there anything I can do about this situation? Or am I shit out of like.

Seller told me that he'll let me cancel my order because I changed my mind even after I won the bid and paid. He hasn't shipped yet. What will happen though? 

Will I get a strike? 

How long will it take get my money back? I paid with a debit card through Paypal. 

Should I wait for him to refund me before I accept to cancel the order? I have to choose an option when they send the cancellation right?",4,4,2016-04-04,EBAY,0.11595457792282104,0.8560311794281006,0.02801426686346531

Ebay,restricted account -buyer,"hi my ebay account (im a buyer) was suddenly restricted and so is my partners.

I have read this could be because we share the same address and he may have logged onto his account via my laptop? 

My feedback is fine been a member since 2014, he is relatively new but good feedback as well.

I have emailed them but been given different stories; that i need to open a paypal account  as I can only use the guest checkout (that is use my debit card instead of a paypal account) for a limited amount of times, that there's a technical glitch,etc etc. 
Ebay wont respond anymore and Paypal asked me to PM them on FB,the messages were read with no reply.


Can anyone enlighten me?

 And if it is because we both live here and im screwed and they wont lift restrictions- which seems insane- do i need a new account? or new IP ? like what do i have to do? 

I have bought things and i just want to pay the sellers. this seems insane

I was getting ""this card cannot be used , try a different card""

Ebay,Buyer Requests To Cancel After Paying,"First off I want to mention I am a fairly new seller on Ebay and am not familiar with the process of cancelling orders.

I sold an item for $275.00 late last night. Immediately after it sold I informed the buyer I would be shipping it after I get off work today or tomorrow morning. The shipping label had already been purchased and printed via Ebay.

Today after I got off work he asked me if the product had been shipped yet. I told him no it had not and that it is already packaged with the shipping label on the box and will be shipped in the morning.

The buyer then responds asking if he can cancel the order because he found a similar product for $25.00 cheaper. The customer has already paid.

Should I refund the purchase and cancel the order, causing me to eat the shipping fee? Or is it reasonable for me to continue with our agreement and ship the item he agreed to purchase.",10,4,2016-04-05,EBAY,0.10457077622413635,0.8440164923667908,0.05141274258494377
Ebay,Shipped phone to a courier that reroutes packages; that courier is unable track package with my tracking number; what's expected by me from ebay?,"First, sorry for my rambling.  I'm just a little annoyed.

So...I sold my used iPhone 6 plus 64gig edition on eBay.  First person to win the auction never paid so I relisted.  Relisted; final bid on the auction was a lot less (possibly because it fell on Easter Sunday...was bummed out, but proceeded to deliver).  The person paid within a day; shipped the package.  Verified that the package was delivered and signed for (shipped via USPS priority with insurance/signature confirmation).  Shortly after it was delivered, USPS was experiencing an issue with their tracking data and showed an error; lasted for a couple of days maybe.  Person who won the auction emailed me about the tracking issue.  During this, I realized this person most likely lives internationally (possibly Pakistan from their ebay profile).  The address the package was shipped to went to a courier company called WS1. http://ws1.com/.  I was pretty annoyed when I realized this since I don't like dealing with international orders/marked the auction as US only.  Anyway, the tracking issue eventually was fixed on USPS website.  Showed the person who won the auction that it was delivered and signed for.  Now he's telling me that the courier WS1 cannot find the package with the supplied tracking number.

My question...how much digging and research do I need to do to protect myself?  I can't tell if this guy is trying to scam me out of money or if the courier WS1 lost/stole package.  

I already emailed/contacted USPS to see if there was another tracking number on the package that they could provide.  Before that, I emailed WS1 to see if they could track down the package...verified that they couldn't.

When I searched the address for the WS1 courier; I found an interesting website:  http://badbuyerlist.org/buyer/e27e6763ed4c18b7a311 Lots of complaints regarding one person who uses this address (different name/suite)",10,4,2016-04-05,EBAY,0.09118472039699554,0.8849730491638184,0.02384224161505699

Ebay,Buyer requesting refund for a different region video game,"A month ago I sold a PAL video game to a US buyer. It was a rare PAL exclusive game and not the first my first time I sold a PAL game to a different region country (NTSC-U/J). Today I got a return request process from the buyer with a return reason ""Doesn't work or defective"" and a comment saying it does not work on a US playstation system. The game disc is pristine and I tested it on my different systems (3 in total, one of them is picky about disc conditions and still played fine). The buyer had it for more than 15 days (I sent tracked&amp;signed as I always do) and never attempted to communicate back, instead just went straight to a return process asking for full refund and choosing the seller to pay for it! I have a no returns policy (I know, I know, it doesn't mean much) but I replied back and said the item was described as a PAL region (title, listing specific setting, description and photos) and it's up to the buyer to make an informed decision. I don't know beforehand if the game was just for collecting or playing.
I didn't chose any option to accept return, just replied back and explained it, hinting that there were alternative ways to play imports of he still wanted the game. And even though I don't accept returns I offered to do a full refund once I got the item back, which should be returned with tracking &amp; signature confirmation. I don't find it fair for me to be responsible for an uninformed or impulse buyer purchase, specially when I take great care to have good pictures and plain simple straight to the point descriptions (as a non-native english speaker I find it also helps other buyers like me).

This is my first returns case out of almost 500 sellings. I'm not sure if I'm being fished for a scam, a buyers remorse or a genuine uninformed buyer. The eBay retuns text is pretty intimidating, though. I feel like I'm in the imminence of loosing the game and also the money (it's already on hold and not displayed on Paypal account).

Ebay,"Possible scam? International seller wants to buy outside eBay, pay through Paypal","First time in here. Have been an *occasional* eBay seller for 10 years now. I currently have a phone for sale, and I got a message from an international customer with 0 feedback, who just signed up, asking if I could send him a Paypal request for about $100 more than the going rate of my phone to buy the item. 

I really can't tell if it's a possible scam or just a foreign buyer (Malaysia) who doesn't speak english well and doesn't know the typical rules. I just can't figure out how exactly it would be a scam if he has to pay through Paypal. I have read some stories of buyers claiming they didn't get an item, opening a dispute, and the money gets locked up or even refunded to the buyer. But this appears to usually be through eBay, not paypal. 

Are Paypal's policies better than eBay for protecting sellers? Or even if this is through Paypal is it likely he could open a dispute and get his money back?

Ebay,Flaw in eBays Seller Performance Design Structure,"Legitimately ripped eBay a new ******* this morning after I find my account limited for selling. However I found a design defect in the algorithm that lead to the limitation.   

Their designed system structure is to use initial tracking information to maintain a base line on if the seller shipped the item within the allotted time frame listed within he initial sale listing (handling time). However if you ship the item and it gets there within the estimated delivery date (listed when the buyers buying the item) it doesn't matter the handling time because you met the requirement for delivery.   

It seems their system however is not designed to foresee that instance and penalizes you for not shipping within the time frame you specified when listing!

If you call them up and have them individually go through all the items they have that are negatively effecting your account they HAVE TO DO THEIR JOB and go though them ALL as far back as 90 days.

I then had the representative transfer me to the correct department that will reinstate my account with out having to wait for the 1 month review period.

I e-mailed him about the phone's problem, telling him I may request a return if it's a re-accruing problem throughout the day.

He said it was fine, but to let him know the next morning. 

The phone continued to heat up throughout the night and next morning, so I requested a return and I e-mailed him. 


He e-mailed back a few directions to solve this problem. 

I told him it didn't work, and I'd just like to go forward with the return. 

 He replied back that the phone was still under warranty and that he'd talk with the company. He said he'd reply back after he talks with them. 

He finally replied back, and now he wants me to contact him directly through cellphone, with no other information provided.


What do I do here? Should I really call this random stranger about the phone? What should I tell him back? Should I contact e-bay? This is an individual seller. At this point, I want to just get a refund.

Ebay,Help Re: Item Shipped via USPS Signature Confirmation,"Hey /r/ebay. I am needing some advice regarding my situation. I purchased an item on eBay for $700 (jewelry). The seller shipped it via USPS Priority Mail w/ Signature Confirmation and per the tracking, it was delivered and signed for by me yesterday, April 8th @ 6:32 PM. A couple problems though:

1) I was not home since I was working. I have one roommate, who has a different first and last name as me, who was also working, so he could not sign for it. Therefore, no one was at my residence.

2) I live in a condominium building with a locked door. The only way the mail carrier can enter is via the intercom. I never received a call from it. There are also 5 other units and after asking each unit, no one stated they signed for it / saw any packages. Also,  how could they sign under my name? Since I live in a specific unit, I would assume that the carrier would have to knock on the door to my unit.

I requested the signature and address from USPS and upon receiving it, it's not even close to my signature. Completely wrong. I contacted the seller at this point w/ the scenario and haven't received a response. I also contacted USPS who opened a case, but I know how moronic they are. What should I do?

Ebay,Negative feedback from guy trying to get a partial refund,"Any thoughts would be appreciated!

So I sold a Playstation 3 videogame from 2009 as ""very good"" - it was for cheap and came in the case with art, but no manual.  The case and art were far better then most videogames you would find at Gamestop or something from around the same time.

Guy messages me and says ""how is this very good?  the case has scratches and the art has folds and the disc has scratches.""  None of this is true, so I ask for pictures.  He sends back pictures of the wrong game.  I reply with that's not the game I sold you maybe you're mistaking me for another seller.  He replies with ""oops wrong pictures"" then sends me 1 of the same pictures along with 2 pictures of my real game, but both pictures of my game are close up and have a big light reflection on it.  Despite the big reflection, I don't see anything wrong with the case or art.  There are certainly no scratches or folded up artwork or anything.  He also says the disc is scratched but he ""can't take a picture because the scratches don't show up.""  PS3 discs are blu-ray - they are very hard to scratch, and even if there is a minor scratch, it will not matter.  You have to like take a knife and a lot of hate to a Blu-Ray disc to really scratch it up.

At this point I was unsure of what to do, so I didn't reply right away.  I didn't want to blatantly call him out again because I was afraid that would turn bad.    I admit I forgot about it, so I look at my feedback today, 5 days after the last message, and he's left me a negative feedback. His comment says the item was not as described and that I ignored his messages.   He actually never asked for partial refund but I'm 95% sure this is where it was going, especially because he didn't return the item and I offer returns. 

OK, so I should have replied earlier, I concede to that, but I don't think it's worth a negative feedback.    He sent wrong pictures and then when informed of that, he again sends one of the same pictures claiming it's the game I sent.   I'm going to call in Monday morning (better chance of USA rep, I think) and was curious to hear unbiased opinions of this interaction.  

thanks guys!

TL;DR - buyer gave negative feedback after he claims item was in worse condition then stated and sends me wrong pictures, he's informed pics are wrong and sends 3 more - 1 is the same pic again.

Ebay,"Please help, what's going on here and what can I do?","I just sold a van on ebay, the top bidder had terrible feedback and I was going to cancel his bid, but the ebay bid cancellation page seemed to imply that you can only cancel bids in certain circumstances and I didn't feel that this was one of them, so didn't/couldn't cancel. As a result the person won the bid and then basically messed me around for four days saying he was coming to collect and then not turning up and finally called to say that he had changed his mind. Since then he has lied on the feedback (gave me negative feedback and said the van was in an accident, which it was not) and is not responding to the request to cancel the sale. I think I have reported the feedback but I don't seem to have any open cases with ebay at the moment, what should I do now?

He has six feedbacks and I know this sounds very judgemental but on the phone he sounded like an Irish traveller and two of the only ok-ish feedbacks he has are from someone called ****romany, so I feel as though there's some sort of scam going on but can't work out what it is.

The only reason for selling again is that I desperately need the money for rent due to bei on disability right now. Anyways I want to know if I can just cancel and refund the money. I know I will get a defect, but from what I understand I get one as a ""freebie"" right? I don't want to communciate this with the buyer because he knows he basically stole this item. It sold within minutes of being posted, and in a niche group of collectibles. Surely there are times when a seller loses, gets robbed, already sold and item right? Frankly I don't want to give this item at that price. I also don't want to ruin my new seller account. Basically I'm asking if I can just tell the buyer that something happen, I don't have the item, refund the money to him, and sell this particular item somewhere else besides eBay?

Ebay,Claims my item was sent broken...,"I got a really good one yesterday - sold two items to a guy, he messages me on eBay and sends a picture showing that one of them arrived broken and wanted to know how I would resolve it.  I sent him my standard reply for once I got a picture - basically, that if that's how it arrived it's either USPS handling issues or mail tampering, so go ahead and return the item, follow eBay's item condition policy for returns, and I'll be happy to open a case on my end with USPS and escalate if needed.  If I'm really sure that somebody is trying to pull something (like if the box was factory sealed and it's not something that would be damaged in transit), I usually end by stressing how important it is to include all of the items that were sent as they will now be evidence and to not be alarmed if they're contacted as a witness. 

Almost immediately, I start getting messages back:

""I assure you since the package was in wonderful shape and this &lt;item&gt; was on the bottom, it was not tampered with in any way. This was sent damaged and I need my return shipping paid as this was the fault of whomever didn't check prior to packaging.""

I didn't respond since I already told him I would accept the return (there's no use in arguing with this, he hadn't tripped himself up, he sent pictures, here we are at the 'cost of doing business' on eBay!).  Almost immediately, a second message:

""Oh and we found the piece of the &lt;item&gt; stuffed inside the manual of the packaging. The post office wouldn't do that. The package was sealed and in tip top shape. I can send a pic of it if you would like. The case isn't even useable!""

Again, no response - I've seen and lost this fight before.  I know I'm being scammed, and without evidence from his mouth, I know I'm screwed.  But then, then the REALLY awesome message came in:

""So sorry, these emails should have gone to different eBay seller as your items I haven't even received yet. Disregard all messages.""

Now, normally I check the order status, etc. before responding to these, but we were at the zoo and with the pictures, etc. I just assumed it was the same old BS I deal with often.  I'm not sure what this guy was trying to pull - if he legitimately ordered the same two sets of items from two different sellers and the other package had issues? (I effing doubt it) - but I think he screwed up his timing trying to scam me out of two, brand new, sealed items.

It's been over a day and I still get a smile on my face because of this guy.  His items are still in transit.  I'm going to laugh so hard if he comes back and tries to do it again.",2,12,2016-04-10,EBAY,0.10458928346633911,0.8652496933937073,0.030160963535308838
Ebay,Buyer requesting refund on shoes she has now worn !!,"I sold a pair of Adidas Yeezy 350s sneakers on eBay a few months ago, the shoes arrived over a month ago and I shipped them in perfect brand new condition. I had no returns listed on my item. 

She has had the shoes for over a month now and has clearly worn them. She has now sent a request for a refund, stating the stitching is uneven and be suede is frayed (which happens after suede shoes are washed). I know the shoes were perfect when I sent them. 

How do I go about this ?

EDIT***
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Okay I sent the buyer a message on email, explaining to her that after a month I will not accept a return as I have no idea what she has done with the shoes, I also said that a normal person would open and check their package once they receive it, rather than wait a month. 

The buyer never replied in 36 hours so I thought it would be a great time to call ebay as it shows the buyer as un interested. 

I called ebay,
sent them the pictures and explained the story to them.

Ebay,"Buyer paid for a personalized item, but hasn't responded to messages asking for details","Hi all,

I sell a product on Ebay that is personalized; buyers get a name put onto and into the product. 95% of buyers usually are getting it as a gift, so the name on it is not the same as the buyer.

On Friday morning, someone bought the item. On the listing, I say that following a purchase, I will get in touch with them to ask what name they want on the item. The majority of customers usually get in touch with me first, either by leaving a note on Paypal or by sending me a message. If not, I send one off, get the reply and send the item.

But the person who bought the item on Friday, and has paid for the item, has not responded to two messages now (one sent 20 minutes after they purchased the item, one sent earlier this afternoon). The shipping time is 1-3 days, so as to give me time to personalize the item. Which means its due out tomorrow based on the information I offered Ebay.

So the question is...what do I do with someone who paid for a personalized item but never sent any more details? I don't want to catch negative feedback, so thought I'd ask some advice. my gut instinct is to wait till Thursday and send another message saying if I don't get any response by Friday night, I'll issue a full refund.

Ebay,Some advice selling magazine back issues?,"Hi, so just some background information these magazines are all 20 years old and belonged to a family friend who passed away over a decade ago.

My main question is regarding the mailing labels. Since the magazines are so old the labels do not remove easily - I tried to remove one and it is impossible to do so without tearing the cover in some way. Other sellers seem to do it one of two ways - covering the label in their pics or blotting out the name/address with a permanent marker. The former leaves the problem of the name (not sure how much a problem it is since the addressee passed away), and the latter looks a bit ugly in my opinion.

Would appreciate any opinions and please note if you are giving this opinion as a seller/buyer or both. Thanks!",2,3,2016-04-11,EBAY,0.06075102463364601,0.9084435701370239,0.030805377289652824
Ebay,Rare &amp; signed 'Shame' movie poster,"At home I have an extremely rare print of the Steve McQueen film 'Shame' (signed by Carey Mulligan &amp; Steve McQueen). I've tried doing a bit of research on the poster but cannot find any info of it anywhere so I can only assume this particular print is very rare. The entire poster is basically a silver reflective sheet with the movie title/credits and cast names on top.

I have no idea how to quantify the value of the poster so was wondering if anyone else has experience selling/valuing movie posters like this? I would naturally assume this particular poster is reasonably valuable as not only is it a rare print but also signed.

I listed them as a but it now or best offer, no returns accepted.I had clear photos of every angle and an accurate description. After 2 weeks the buyer bought them for $650. Shipped and delivered and a day later the buyer open a return request saying the shoes were fake replicas. I disputed it, as they claimed they took the shoes to the Dior store(just so happens they live in NY, which has the only US Dior store). I realized quick they were just showing angles of the shoes that did not display the Dior logo, trying to imply they were missing logos and were fake. I called Dior and Dior informed me they can only authenticate by shipping the shoes to their headquarters in France. I posted and sent all this to eBay. eBay decided in the buyer's favor. 

12 days pass and no tracking number or shoes were sent to me, I call eBay and they say don't worry about it, we will close the case in your favor. Next day, the case is still open and there is a tracking number.

Ebay,"Purchased an iPhone from eBay, notified by eBay following day that the users account was compromised, trying to get refund and now eBay is giving me the run around. Where the heck is my money???","I don't want to drag this post out. I am hoping it makes it to an eBay rep where they might possibly expedite the process now that it's been a week since the purchase.

Purchased an iPhone on April 6th. Following day, eBay notified me that the seller's account had been compromised and the item listing was fraudulent. The email suggested I go through the ""Resolution"" page. The page ran me in circles, and eventually said I was not eligible to create a case against the seller.

I called eBay, bounced around to a few departments, finally my case was opened. The representative I spoke with said I would be notified of refund by Friday, and my money should be refunded by Monday latest.

Monday rolls around, still nothing, no updates on case... I call, bounced around once again to several departments, and finally made it to the right guy. He told me that the refund failed (I paid via PayPal) and my case was handled improperly. Then he told me that he sent the case to another department where I would indefinitely receive my refund. He said it would be Thursday (April 14th) at the latest where I would receive confirmation on my refund. After that, it usually takes 2-5 business days to issue the full refund... Which means, I will be receiving it on April 19th the latest (almost two weeks to receive my refund).

After being bounced around to several departments, told different things, and STILL have not received a refund which eBay has acknowledged to be a compromised purchase, this will probably be my last eBay purchase going forward. I frequently shop online and have ran into issues in the past, but I have never been thrown into such a circle jerk with excuses.

This was intended to be a present for a family member who has been going through a rough patch and can't afford to upgrade her flip phone. Her birthday is today and unfortunately I am unable to afford another $140 (part time college student, paying my own bills) to get her that phone.

Ebay,Took 2 months but I actually won a PayPal case as a seller,"It's been a long saga, but one of the biggest thorns in my side for the past few months finally got resolved today.

Back in mid-February a customer bought 2 items from my company on eBay - a pearl bracelet and an antique ladies watch. These were separate transactions and the bracelet sold first. The customer received it and left us positive feedback. Then she got the watch. She claimed it wasn't as described and said it was ""child size"" despite it stating right in the description that it was a mere 15mm in diameter (which is standard for antique ladies watches).

She initiated an eBay return for the watch but since this was before eBay's update to their policies after which sellers can no longer fight INAD cases if they have a return policy, we were able to fight this as buyer's remorse and it was closed in our favor.

So the buyer opened a PayPal case and somehow won it despite pointing out to PayPal that the size was clearly stated in the listing.

In the meantime, the buyer tried to initiate an eBay return for the bracelet, again claiming it wasn't as described but providing no reason, just saying ""garbage"". Since this was after the revision to the policies, we couldn't fight it and ended up accepting it. But as before, the buyer didn't ship it in time and the case was closed.

We did end up receiving the bracelet back, and the seller then opened a PayPal case as well as an appeal on the watch and fraudulently used the tracking number for the bracelet for the watch which we never received.

Finally today, after 45 minutes on the phone with PayPal, I got them to realize that she was using the same tracking number for both items and attempting to defraud us out of one item. Since we got the bracelet back they're forcing that refund now, but we actually won the case for the watch and get to keep the money on that one!

I'm still disappointed that PayPal is forcing the refund for the bracelet because it was as described (she claimed the clasp was broken, but in reality, she just put it in upside down), but at least we have the item back and can resell it.",7,23,2016-04-13,EBAY,0.05245243012905121,0.9101463556289673,0.03740119934082031

I doubt the buyers will report any of my stuff because they are all in good shape and as listed (I posted a lot of photos too).

Ebay,"Seller (storefront) advertises 12 Month Manufacturer Warranty, but manufacturer is not honoring since it was purchased on ebay in the first place.

Ebay,USPS delivered package to wrong address - I'm the seller. Unique situation.,"So I have a weird situation.

I shipped a package worth $320 to an address and instead of purchasing signature confirmation (since it's not required), I insured it for $300 instead so I get free signature confirmation.  I requested the signature to verify one was actually obtained (USPS sometimes forgets but still marks the package as delivered), and underneath the recipients name, the address is not the same one I sent it to.

Any ideas?  It is insured so I think I might be covered should anything go wrong.

Ebay,Pretty Sure I Got Scammed,"Quick rundown;

I sold a collectible trading card on eBay for $220USD to a buyer from China. Now, I promised tracking on the item and our postal services wanted $80 for this service so I made the tracking for Registered Mail which meant the cost was down to $20, gives me the bonus of tracking and the buyer having to sign out the package.

On the 22nd of March, I get a notification that the buyer states that the package came empty from the mail service empty with a ""certificate"" that the envelope came this way. I log in and see that the mail delivery attempt was made but not yet signed out. I check the next day and see that the envelope was picked up and signed for on the 23rd. The buyer claims that he will upload the documents to prove that the mail was sent to him empty, I keep an eye on the case and he never uploads the documents. I had called PayPal to explain the situation, upload my proof of shipment and point out the disparity of claim and receivership dates.

I get an email today from PayPal stating that they have found in favor of the buyer although he has not shown any proof to state his case and I am now out $220USD

Ebay,Buyer claiming his item never arrived 3-4 weeks after posting,"Hi guys :) just after a few opinions.

I sold a mobile phone and tablet on ebay march 10th. The customer messaged me a few days after posting (16th) saying his item never arrived. I chased the post office who advised the parcel can not be reported missing until it reached 15 days. I had not heard anything after that so presumed my item arrived to the buyer. until yesterday 14 april (nearly 4 weeks later) the customer got in touch asking for a refund since his item never arrived. He has opened a dispute asking for the money returned. The delivery has not been signed for but I am not sure if that is down to royal mail error (customer could have his item) or the it is still lost in transit.

Just wondering where do I stand and what are my next steps? Do I issue a refund and raise a claim with royal mail/post office for losing my item? Or hang on to my cash, chase royal mail etc.

Ebay,Return fraud again.,"- Buyer purchased $100 sporting goods item, plus $20 in shipping cost.  
- Buyer received and immediately claims it doesn't work.
- Buyer opened return without any contact with one 4-word sentence.
- I give the buyer some troubleshooting steps, and ask the buyer to attempt to use the item again, please.  I wait a day then accept the return because I know fighting them now is impossible, and wanted to get the clock moving on that.
- Buyer doesn't respond to messages, and returns item in lightning speed.
- I pull it from the box and test it about 25 times.  It works even better than how the product box and manufacturer describes it. Not even the smallest sign of malfunction.  The item will resell without any problem.
- So, this is a return where if I were allowed to do it correctly, the buyer would get a refund of the item price, hit with a restocking fee for rendering the item used, then receive nothing else other than being reported to eBay and placement on my block list.  

- However as it sits, I'm on the hook for $40 in shipping cost.  If I ask ebay to ""Step In"", I risk them auto-deciding for the buyer, and getting a ""closed case without seller resolution"", and 2 hours of fighting with someone on the phone.  It's set up so I can't win no matter what I do here.
- Buyer had 70 feedback, and responded to none of my communication.  I even tried to be personable and brought up the idea that I'd basically be a moron if I sent him a malfunctioning item to be on the hook for $40 in shipping....so if it's broken, I need to file an insurance claim.  No response, and no chance to do what's right thanks to eBay's 3 day deadline for me to respond to their fake claim.  What a worthless person.

Ebay,Seller never sent item and opened a case.,"I bought a $100 item from someone. I told them I needed it before a certain date because I needed it for an event that was coming up. Fast forward 2 weeks, I still hadn't received the item. Being a understanding person, I told them it was ok and went to the event without it. I asked if they had tracking information and they said they did not and mailed it on in a plain envelope. I told them i'd give it another 2 weeks before opening a case (gives them a solid month for the item to arrive). Today I got an email from Ebay saying the seller opened a case trying to say that I scammed them.

Really upsetting. Anything I need to watch out for? I've bought a bunch of stuff recently on ebay and wouldn't think of trying to scam someone. I did tell them in an email that I would highly recommend getting tracking on future sales because some buyers try to claim they never got the item. I also told them I would notify them if I receive the item as I post reviews for sellers as soon as I receive the items.

EDIT: Clarification...
I opened a case so I could email the seller and ask where the items were or if he had tracking so I could check up on the item. After I didn't receive it he escalated and asked ebay to step in.",21,3,2016-04-18,EBAY,0.04428476840257645,0.9258266687393188,0.02988852933049202
Ebay,Shipping a large (~80 pound) digital keyboard?,"I'm planning on selling a fairly large digital keyboard - 54.3″ x 17.8″ x 4.8″, around 80 pounds. I'm hoping to get a local buyer to pick it up, but because of its ""vintage"" nature (it was a ~$6000 synth 20 years ago) I think I'll be able to get significantly more money for it on eBay.

I'm just worried about shipping. I have shipped smaller and lighter keyboards via UPS without issue before, but I've never shipped something this large and heavy. And of course, I've heard many horror stories of these kinds of things getting destroyed by UPS and FedEx.

Assuming that I pack it sufficiently (box-within-a-box, multiple layers of bubblewrap, etc.), does UPS/FedEx shipping insurance cover me in the (seemingly likely) event that it gets damaged in shipping?

Hello *my eBay name*   ,

Thanks for selling on eBay.


We were recently contacted by *buyer* about an issue with item *item number* . The buyer would like to update the shipping address for the order.

Please contact the buyer directly. We've also asked the buyer to contact you in order to work things out.

If the issue has already been resolved, please disregard this message.

 
This is a courtesy message to put you and the buyer in touch with one another to resolve an issue.  Please don't reply to this message as it was sent from a mailbox that isn't monitored.
 

Thanks,

eBay ""

The money has shown up on my PayPal account, but all of this information has me skeptical. There is no logo or anything on the message from eBay, just text. Also the buyer has good history, but the address isn't on eBay, so they might be able to claim they never received the item.

Ebay,"Is there anything I can do to about a seller who returned a damaged item, but who claimed it was damaged when I first sent it out?","Sorry for the tongue twister title! Sold an item, brand new perfect condition with the tags attached etc. The buyer left positive feedback. Three days later, initiated a return stating it wasn't as described as there was a slight minor fault. I said I do not accept returns and the fault was not present when it was sent out, as such it's still as described, but you just broke it. They argued it was like that upon arrival and they never used it to break it. eBay sided with them. I received the item back today with the fault present and tags removed. eBay wants me to refund them. 

I have a side by side comparison from the listing and the item sent to me, and if the fault was present it would have been visible in the listing. I phoned eBay and they said they can't prove it wasn't sent out like that, so they're just sticking with the buyer. 

I can't afford to refund them, and it's now worthless, so I'm truly out of pocket. I'm absolutely raging with anger, I even want to post the item BACK as I do not wish to accept it in its current condition. As a private seller, I thought my duty was to provide an accurate description and send it out to match that description, and I did - any damage or faults aren't covered by the Consumer Rights laws here in the UK, if I was a business I'd have responsibility, but I'm not, so I don't. And to top it off, eBay wants me to pay £2.99 for a returns label!! Is there any way I can argue this case? The item is now worth nothing, I originally paid £80, sold it for £26 (inc shipping) so I already made a huge loss, I really cannot afford to be swindled like this. I don't know whether it's relevant but I have 800+ 100% positive feedback whereas the buyer only has five, surely my reputation over the years as an honest seller stands for something vs a new account? I'm proper cheesed off about this and I'm put off selling in future, I've heard about stories like this before but never experienced one until now. :(",11,2,2016-04-18,EBAY,0.0761464461684227,0.8917403817176819,0.03211318701505661
Ebay,Buyer claims £780 item arrived used/broken,"I seriously need some help. Basically I think a buyer is trying to scam me through a illegitimate item not as described/broken item claim. £780 is a lot of money to me and I can't afford to take that kind of a loss

So I sold 2 graphics cards on Ebay for £780 each. I know for a fact they were both brand new and sealed. The 1st delivered fine and the buyer was happy with it. The 2nd delivered fine but the buyer (originally) claimed it was used. 

It took the buyer 6 hours from first communication of telling me it had arrived in a used condition, to claiming that it was actually broken.

Whilst communicating the buyer first told that he 'tested the card and looked at the memory usage and it has been used before'. However many messages later he told me that the ""Item is not new at all and it doesn't work"". How could he run digital tests on an electrical component if it's broken? Every time I've confronted him about this hasn't given me an explanation.

It has been escalated to an Ebay case and his final message is 'Hi. I purchase an item which was listed NEW and SEALED. But it was not and parts were missing. I contacted the seller and as soon as the item arrive to make him aware of this but he was calling me a liar from the start I tested the item and it doesn't even work. So he sold a used and broken item. I have been threatened with the police. I want my money back as all get from the seller us treats and lies. I don't expect any of this when I purchase something from ebay. Kind Regards'

Ebay,Buyer is abusing Ebay guarantee. I even voiced my concern before I shipped item out,"So this is a little bit of a story.....
 
Late last month I bought a Tmobile sim card from a buyer. When I tried to activate it, it wasnt for what the box said ($30 prepaid walmart card) It was for a postpaid account only. So I email the Seller to get a return going and he tells me he has sold several and none of them were bad. We then exchanged a few angry emails back and forth and he says if there is no airtime left on the card that he will not refund me, which I said fine. I sent the card back to him and have yet to receive a refund.
On that same day, I am selling 2 things on my account and he buys one for $250. Its a bluetooth waterproof speaker. I thought it was odd that he would just purchase this from me and I was hesitant to send it out. I was so hesitant that I called ebay to voice my concerns because I feel like he is just going to send me back to me, open after I have pictures proving its brand new. So I take pictures of it before I send it out and low and behold a couple weeks pass and now he wants to do a return. He says 'its a different model"" but there is only 1 kind of model. He is just trying to screw me. My feedback score of almost 300ppl is 100% and he has negatives on his. I really hope Ebay really doesnt let me send it back to me and make me refund him.

Turns out they might make a good return overall, but with a few exceptions, most of them are worth a dollar or two *at most*.

I shop on eBay fairly regularly, usually for items $100+. I find that every time I make a search, I have to change all the settings -

Ebay,Buyer fraud?,"Hey I'm back again. I just sold a Wii U that I had bought from craigslist with digital games tied to his NNID. So. I decided to sell it on ebay, so I can buy another one and put my own NNID on it, because I had no interest in the games and wanted to sell the system with those electronic games. I explicitly said in my listing all the above details, and someone bought it, shipped it, done and done. He messaged me later saying his kids are disenchanted with not having their own account or something and that Nintendo thinks they sold it. So he wanted a return. I shouldn't have complied, but I said sure why not, cause I'm a nice guy but not anymore after this. He sent it back missing: the box I sent it in (Wii U box) AND it was missing all the digital games, but the Wii U was NOT erased. So I was down like 90$ at that point, and offered to refund him 150$, which I thought was fair (he bought for 230). He declined and said that he knew I was going to do that and said if he doesn't receive a refund, he'll report me to ebay for fraud. I was like wtf so I called ebay, and they said they have the message details and everything and that they're opening an investigation and that everything should be ok for me. As soon as I got off the phone, the buyer opened a resolution charge against me. Do you guys think I'll win this?

Buyer replied saying that I ruined their partner's birthday gift by the item being in poor condition and that they want me to ""cut a deal"" on another one of my listed items as it would make their partner happy. I was immediately put on guard because I've never had a quid pro quo offer like this.

Ebay,"Selling an expensive item (over $1000), buyer using an overseas forwarding address and their email is a Hong Kong business","I'm wondering what steps I can take to verify the buyer and protect myself here. 

Would you ship this item or try to cancel the order? Is there anything I should do before shipping, or anything I should ask from the buyer to verify this is not going to end up being a scam (not as described claim) or chargeback? 

Here are the details I have looked at so far:

* Buyer's shipping address is a Portland Oregon (US) shipping address with a box/unit number. Looking up further the address is an overseas forwarding company: www.usgobuy.com
* Buyer's ebay account is over 10 years old. Has about 40 feedback, some as a seller, some as buyer. No account ID changes. eBay account name is very similar to the name on the shipping address (for example John Smith with eBay ID Jsmith).
* Buyer's paypal account registered name is the Hong Kong Business name (so the PayPal registered account name does not match the first and last name given on the shipping address)
* Buyer's shipping address is CONFIRMED in paypal
* PayPal payment sender is Non-US Verified

* The buyer's payment email address is from a website for a Hong Kong business. Their business website is well fleshed out, has a ton of social media (youtube and twitter etc), and goes back at least 1 year.
* The business name matches the domain name on the email address
* PayPal put the payment on hold for verification right when it was received, but it cleared within just a couple hours. I am not sure if this is because of the buyer or because I was receiving a much larger payment than normal.

Any tips for what I should request from the buyer for additional verification? What would you do? Thanks!",6,6,2016-04-25,EBAY,0.046400148421525955,0.9290228486061096,0.024577056989073753

Ebay,Ebay Chargeback Scam - Please Advise,"Initially posted this under personal finance..
""n January of this year I sold a pair of shoes on Ebay, it was my first time listing an item so the whole process was kind of new to me.
Item was listed mid January and sold on the 21st, I proceeded to ship the package through Canada Post Standard Shipping. I was issued an order number and tracking number as well. Yesterday I was checking my e-mails and noticed Paypal had e-mail me stating a chargeback had been applied against my account by the buyers credit card company. What are my options here?
I have already responded to the claim through Paypal's Resolution Centre and I have already provided them with an Order Number and Tracking Number - what is the process from here moving forward? I looked on reddit at other users having similar issues and I can't tell if the item I sold is eligible for any kind of Seller Protection. The shoes sold were a pair of Air Jordan 11's in Legend Blue - hoping I won't be out $380.."" 
The chargeckback was for an unauthorized charge but I provided Paypal with proof that I shipped to the address that Ebay and Paypal provided.

Update: I have lost the review and have been charged $400 - $380 for the shoes plus a charge back fee of $20. Is there anyway I can get around this charge? Can I not pay the outstanding paypal balance with my credit card - then dispute the charge the same way the buyer did to me in this case??? 

I cannot believe that I have been scammed out of $400 for following literally every step Ebay provided me with. The buyer waited until the last possible moment to issue the charge back - I wasn't even able to view the sale in my Ebay homepage. I am a student and really cannot afford this charge..

Ebay,Buyer claiming something doesn't work after return period,"So I sold a DVD box set on eBay. DVDs were in ""like new"" condition with a 14 day return policy with buyer paying shipping. Since I was capped on my shipping at 6 dollars the real cost to ship was around 9 dollars and I sold the set for around 10 dollars or around 20 shipped. 

I get positive feedback and he/she has about a 200 FB score. So about 10 days after I shipped the item I get a message through saying that one of the DVDs in the box set freezes at the hour mark. 

I offer 2 options to her, she can ship the DVDs back to me (it will cost her 9 dollars roughly) via eBay return process or I can offer her a partial refund she can keep the DVDs and we both avoid the shipping cost. Meaning if I refund her the full amount after she ships back to me it would cost me 9 dollars when I could only have charged 6 in the listing. 

Either way I tell her to try a different DVD player since the DVDs are in perfect condition. She agrees and another 2 weeks go by..

Its been a month now and just yesterday she claims the other DVD player didn't work.

Obviously I should refund her cause you know not being a dick, but what is actually her recourse? Thanks.",6,3,2016-04-26,EBAY,0.038841363042593,0.9016624093055725,0.05949621647596359

Ebay,Ebay doesn't care if a criminal knows where you live.,"- This morning, my Ebay account that I rarely use was hacked. The hacker bought a bunch of items using my credit card info stored on the website and had them shipped to **my address.** 

- I never changed my password in the last few years. Apparently Ebay got hacked in 2014 and IDs and passwords of millions of users were leaked. None of my other accounts (BOA, Gmail, Paypal, etc.) were compromised, so this tells me that the hacker got into my account using information that [was leaked through Ebay](http://www.cnet.com/news/ebay-hacked-requests-all-users-change-passwords/).

- Ebay confirmed that they found evidence that someone had illicitly accessed my account this morning, from the same area as me no less. This leads me to believe that the criminal may be planning on visiting my home to rob me.

- I asked Ebay reps and a manager to give me the IP address from which the hacker accessed my account and illegally purchased goods using my credit card so that I can relay the information to the police and also see for myself where this criminal is located. They denied this request even though I explained to them that my home and family may have been targeted for a crime. **They prioritized the privacy of a criminal over the safety of a customer.**

- Many high-profile websites, such as Google, have no problems with providing me a list of which IP addresses were used to log into my account. It's MY account. But Ebay apparently doesn't want to take responsibility for the mistakes they made in keeping my information private and won't even give me the information of a criminal who may be targeting my family and home.

I'm extremely disappointed in Ebay and I will never use their services again. Not only were they negligent in keeping my highly private personal information (Name, address, CC info, phone number), they were extremely uncooperative when I asked for their help. I'm in shock that such a well-renowned company would be so callous about the safety and privacy of their customers. They don't care about the well-being of their customers and will only do enough to cover themselves. Don't give them your business.

tl;dr - Account hacked by someone who lives near me. He buys items using my Ebay acccount has items shipped to my house, possibly to rob my home when the items arrive. I tell Ebay I need the criminal's IP address to report to the police and to find out where they're located for my own safety. Ebay ignores requests.

I'm perplexed by what's actually happening and how to proceed and was wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences or at least some advice. I'm trying to determine if this is a buyer scam or someone targeting our packages in the USPS.

A little over a month ago I shipped an item to a customer using USPS Priority Mail. Three or four days after sending the watch to the customer I received a message saying that the item the customer received was a different model watch then what they ordered. I initially assumed I had just packaged the wrong watch on a busy day, but after inquiring about the watch he received, I found out it was a model I never stocked before. I asked him to send the watch back to us. He did, and the watch was in fact a severely broken and used watch that I had never carried or sold before. He opened a PayPal case against us and won, so I'm out both the money and the watch. The watch cost about $500 and the one we got back costs about $80. It's a significant loss.

My first hypothesis is that I'm being scammed by the customer. I would have already opened a USPS Mail Fraud case against him if not for the fact that this has happened two more times in recent weeks.

The second instance of this is extremely strange, as the buyer apparently received a much more expensive watch than the one he ordered. After discussing the scenario with him, he decided that he wanted to keep the watch he actually received and didn't want a refund as he got such a great deal. Again, I've never stocked or sold the watch he received.

To top it all off, today I get a message from a customer claiming the same thing. He received the wrong watch then the one he ordered and again, I've never carried or sold the watch he got. This watch was shipped overseas to the UK through the Global Shipping Program.

I'm really at a loss here. Knowing that I'll lose the PayPal cases means that continued instances of this can make a huge dent in my monthly profits. We've been fortunate that none of the customers have given us bad feedback or opened eBay cases, but this could potentially kill our 100% feedback rating which I've maintained for roughly four years now. Does anyone have any advice on how to proceed or how I can help ensure this stops happening?

Ebay,new to seling: buyer says shipping charges are too high. What should I do?,"I have not sold on ebay in about a year or so, this is my second recent sale. It is a clothing item, sold for $5.50 plus shipping. For shipping Ijust checked the box when I set up the listing, USPS priority mail, etc. I think the first item  (very similar to this item) was $12. something for shipping, both at US post office and in the listing itself. So I guess the buyer is looking at $12 shipping right now and doesnt want to pay it

What should I do? Ask him to negotiate a differnt price? ignore him till he pays? is this a scam? I have no idea. help..tx.",17,3,2016-04-29,EBAY,0.02234305441379547,0.9234463572502136,0.05421056970953941

Ebay,eBay development enviroment: eBay sandbox and go.developers,"Greeting fellow eBayers, I work for a ecommerce agency and we develop eBay stores for some of our clients.
We have 3 developer accounts (1 store and 2 buyers) in the enviroment for developers, with purposes of being able to sell and buy our products and test integrations.
I opened these accounts at the regular domain provided by eBay:
cgi.sandbox.ebay.com 
My problem is that this morning when I wanted to make a purchase to test our latest development I found that both of the buyer accounts have been moved to the domain: 
go.developers.ebay.com
While the store remains in the original sandbox domain, so they cannot communicate with each other.
I would like to know if there is any way to migrate our store to the new domain without having to create a new store and upload the policies and products, as that would waste us time.
Thanks in advance for your replies",0,2,2016-04-29,EBAY,0.035699352622032166,0.924789547920227,0.039511051028966904

She never replied again, I e-mailed her few times more.

Ebay,Have some questions about sellers' feeback and product ratings,"I'm kind of new to ebay and online shopping, I have browsed ebay some times before but now I'm thinking of actually buying some things. I started considering what items I should buy and which sellers to buy from, and have some questions I want to ask.

1.
How do some sellers have such incredibly high positive feedback? I have seen sellers with over 50,000 feedback ratings and had around 98-99% positive feedback. (I saw a guy with 36k+ ratings and 100% were positive, how is that even possible?) Do people have really low expectations when buying something here? Is receiving the item and it being in a decent condition all it takes for a buyer to give a positive feedback? 

&amp;nbsp;

2.
How come there are products that have been sold 1-2000 times with no comment reviews or ratings on them? Most of the products I see have no reviews at all, I saw a keyboard that had been sold over 5000 times and it had no reviews. Why is it like that?

Also, I searched for a mouse pad and found 2 sellers selling a razer goliathus replica, one selling it for 3.5$ has 1,6k sold with no reviews and the other selling it for 5$ has 249 sold with 88 reviews (4.5 stars). Is there an explanation for this? It really doesn't make much sense to me. Why does the one with 250 sold have so many reviews? And which one should I go for? It looks like they are selling the same product but one claims the size is 24,5x32cm and the other 25x29cm, so they could be different products.

&amp;nbsp;

3.
Is it possible for a seller to fake positive feedback or product ratings on their own items? The razer mousepad replica with 88 ratings had a lot of ratings (at least 3/4) marked with ""Verified purchase: No"". Can anyone just make a product review without having bought the item? And also, could a seller buy their own products and give themselves positive feedback?


Can someone please explain these things to me?",8,2,2016-04-29,EBAY,0.025899913161993027,0.9325040578842163,0.04159601777791977
