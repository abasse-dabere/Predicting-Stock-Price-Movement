Ebay,Know of a way to set up a notifier for a new item listing?,"Hey,

I frequently hunt eBay for hard-to-find items. At the moment it's a Nikon MB-20 battery grip. There are none currently listed on eBay. Does anyone know of a way (within eBay, Google, or any other tool,) to be notified when a new item gets listed?

I know that I get ""similar item"" notifications, but is there a way to create a notification for an item that isn't listed at the moment?

Thanks for the help.",2,2,2010-12-07,EBAY,0.02355695329606533,0.9345954060554504,0.04184764623641968

Ebay,"N00b questions. I'm looking to start an ebay store, but it seems impossible without a reputation.","I'm looking to start an ebay store selling designer shoes and handbags, but it seems impossible if I don't have a reputation or any feedback at first. 

How can I make people feel safe about a purchase if I don't have any feedback yet? I'm not looking to scam anyone. 

Is there anything else I should know about selling on ebay?

Any advice you can offer is appreciated.",3,4,2010-12-20,EBAY,0.023268822580575943,0.930271327495575,0.04645983502268791
