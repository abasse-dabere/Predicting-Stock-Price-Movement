Ebay,Combined shipping charges *Help Please*,"Hey fellow ebayers! First time posting here (and on reddit) and I'm wondering if anyone can help me out by answering my question.
I'm selling these face creams as a private seller and ive enabled the GSP option for international buyers. I've had no problems thus far as I've only posted single items to the domestic (UK) GSP centre and they've taken care of the rest. 
A buyer from Australia contacted me yesterday and made an offer to buy my full inventory (5 for the record) of these creams and has asked how this will affect shipping charges. He's given me the current shipping amount which is something like 33 Australian dollars and has asked if it will change now it's a multiple purchase.
I'm not really sure what to say as I don't personally calculate the shipping charges, Ebay do. I also I've said I will post all the creams together and will amend the invoice should he be charged more than once for shipping fees. However I'm worried that by sending the creams together the weight and dimensions of the package will be different and the amount eBay have currently stipulated will be wrong.",4,9,2019-04-01,EBAY,0.0295298732817173,0.9210001230239868,0.04946998879313469

Ebay,Buyer Wants Repair Money?,"Hey guys,

So I'm feeling a scam here but this is the first item I've ever sold and I've been wary of everything. Basically I sold an iPhone 7 for parts/not working and stated that the audio functions did not work on the phone. I updated and reset the phone and shipped it, and a week after delivery the buyer says that the phone gets stuck at the apple logo and that the apple store is going to charge him $19 for a reset/repair (Apple store does not charge for resets that can be done ont he computer, I called to check just in case). He says he doesn't have access to a computer to follow an online guide to reset the phone. If I send him the money, I'm pretty sure he can still submit a claim right? I'm just looking for a second and third opinion. Thanks in advance!

Ebay,Quick Tip On How To Get Your Classic Shipping Page Back.,"Someone in one of my Facebook groups shared this with me, and it made my week, so I wanted to share it with the rest of you.

Most of us have probably had the new eBay shipping page shoved down our throats by now without the ability to go back to the classic view. The problems I am having with it are that the first class weights are messed up on the new page, making it so that anything over 15 ounces can not select First Class. eBay claims the USPS mandated that first class is now only up to 15 ounces, but they have no idea what they are talking about.

To get your classic view of the shipping page back where you can ship 16 ounces first class, do the following:

**In the page link URL in the search bar, look for where it says ""new_label"" and change that so that it instead says ""back_to_classic""**

That will take you back to the old shipping page where you will not have to deal with the 16 ounce first class option not being there.",7,6,2019-04-04,EBAY,0.029420403763651848,0.9249104857444763,0.04566910117864609

I've had my account for over 21 years, never had an issue.  Yesterday I bid on an item, won and went to pay as usual.  The seller has an error that they can not accept payments and to contact them.  They have no feedback and their account is over a year old, no other items listed at this time.  Sent a note to the seller and no response.

Item was $9

I also won 4 other items and all went through fine.

So I tried again this morning, same error.  I called ebay and they said that the account was flagged for fraud.  They said I will get an unpaid buyer strike (even though I have been trying to pay) and the sellers account is now flagged.

This makes no sense.  Why will I get penalized for unpaid strike when I won and tried to pay as I should.  This is not fair at all.

Ebay,"ugghhh just wanted to vent, ebay selling stress","I just started selling on ebay - nothing professional, just selling stuff that I don't use anymore but is still in good condition.

Anyway I sold a thing to a guy and it was all smooth sailing until he asks for a refund through PayPal because he says the thing doesn't work. 

Well I took 2 days to stew because I'm old enough to know better than to message people while angry. and I was angry because the thing 100% worked when I shipped it - I checked it out. But then I thought, well, I have to give him the benefit of the doubt, he's probably a nice enough guy and why do I just assume he's lying. Things do happen.

So I contact him through PayPal - he's sort of polite and sort of rude/defensive (I am also sort of polite and sort of rude/defensive) and we agree to do a full refund if he returns it. Fine.

But then I try to issue the refund and PayPal's site won't let me because it says I don't have enough funds. Okayyy. So I go to link my bank account to deposit more funds but it says I have to confirm that it's MY bank account and I'm not a criminal blah blah blah. Also fine, except it's Saturday night so I can't call my bank (I don't have online banking - I'm a dinosaur). Grr. Fine. To make things even more frustrating I think I COULD have paid the refund with a credit card??? But half of my PayPal is frozen because of ""Account Limitations"" which just popped up the same day this guy contacted me . . . uh huh . . . right, so PayPal thinks I'm a scam artist all because this guy claims the ""thing"" doesn't work. . . Again, FINE! All I have to do to get rid of the ""Account Limitations"" is provide some info. So I scan my drivers license. But they also want ""receipts from my supplier"" . . . Uh. I don't have a supplier. Sooooo I call PayPal customer support and explain to a very nice dude that I don't have a supplier because I'm only selling things that are pre-owned. And he was so agreeable, he's like ""yes, ma'am I will take care of that for you!"" Great!!! Only . . . he did not take care of it, and so  . . . Umm. . What do I do now? 

I decided that since it was Saturday night I would wait and try again Monday morning. But no. I wake up Sunday morning and the buyer has escalated our dispute to a claim. Jerk. Ugh. (Actually I know he's probably NOT a jerk. . . he's like a professional ebayer so he's like this girl didn't instantly issue my refund so I'm just gonna do what a professional ebayer does).

So I go to the dispute claim page thing on PayPal and mash the button, like YES I WILL GIVE THE JERK HIS REFUND WHY WILL YOU NOT LET ME DO THAT!? And this time it works a charm. It gives me a green check mark and says that PayPal will review everything. Why could you not do that last night PayPal??? Huh?

My bank account is STILL not linked, and they still want ""supplier receipts"" and half of my account is still frozen. SO I'm about to call customer support AGAIN!!!! 

I know that nobody did anything morally WRONG here. Buyer did not do anything untoward (unless HE IS LYING ABOUT THE THING NOT WORKING!!!!). I did not do anything evil or mean and I know I shouldn't take it personally. But I do! Why do I feel like a horrible person? Why do I wish Buyer nothing but the worst? Why do I want a PayPal voodoo doll? I think Ebay brings out the worst in me and maybe I should just give my stuff to Goodwill.

Ebay,Nutty Bidder Might Be Setting Me Up for Something,"I suspect I already know the answer, but I will put this out there for comments and feedback.

I placed an auction for two Gear S2 watches recently. Bidding began with an eBay member listed as *private*. A second bidder entered the arena with his own bid, and the two went back and forth for several days outbidding one another. Finally, bidder #2 sent me a message complaining that #1's bidding activity was suspicious. I ignored the message and let the two hash it out.

In the end, bidder #2 won the auction and immediately started sending more messages that bidder #1 drove the price too high. I kindly responded that if he thought the price was too high, he wasn't obligated to place the winning bid (or any bids for that matter). The messages continued after the auction ended with questions about the items, many of which were clearly stated in the auction details.

The winning bidder sent me a final message stating that he will *still* pay because he is a man of his word. I'm thinking, *you should still pay because you bid on and won the auction and nobody forced you to do so*.

I shipped the items without incident within 24 hours and I am nervously waiting for the winner to receive the items.

Ebay,Tips for listing used games/retro games etc. ?,"Hey guys,

Last month I started thinning out my game collection and other stuff I been accumulating over the years. This because I need space, funds and basically *spring cleaning.* I've made good clear photo's of all the games (front cover, back cover, inside, in-lay, disc/cart). So every listing I have has 3-4 photos. 

I've sold a couple of games like this, my prices are all BIN and exact or lower then recent sold listings, and one of the buyers contacted me after receiving the item that he was please with the product, but the description could've been more clear. No negative feedback though.

My descriptions are basically like this:

1. Name of the system + Name of the game
2. Completeness (Complete in box, Missing manual, disc/cartridge only etc.)
3. Clear description of what is missing or damage, e.g. 'Crack in case on back side', 'Front page of manual has a fold, see photos'
4. The usual wall of text for combined shipping, shipping cost etc.

Is there anything else I can do to maybe clear things up and/or boost my sales?

Ebay,"Follow up question about the seller that issued me an immediate refund, closing the case, and locking us out of me getting a return shipping label","Hi again everyone. This has been quite a ride and it’s still not resolved. To quickly recap, I bought a pair of shoes and the seller sent me the wrong size. The seller immediately refunded me for the item plus what I paid in shipping.

Because of this, I cannot print the return shipping label. Ebay customer service says this is because as far as they’re concerned the case is closed.

Not wanting to be a bad dude and keep the seller’s shoes, Ebay told me if I wanted, to have the seller send me a return label BUT ONLY through Ebay messaging (for security purposes).

The seller is telling me he cannot attach a PDF through Ebay messenger, and wants my personal email address.

I told the seller Ebay specifically told me NOT to do this and that I don’t feel comfortable, and I asked him to please call Ebay customer support and ask them what to do.

I’m at a loss here. Aside from me just eating the shipping and sending it off to the seller’s listed address at my own expense (around $15), which feels really unfair considering they not only INAD’d me, but improperly handled the refund/return, I don’t know what to tell them to do to safely get me a return shipping label.

Are they correct you can’t send PDF’s via Ebay messaging? Would there be a safe way to get the seller to get me a return label without giving further personal info?

Ebay,Kicked off of paypal,Yes I got an email the other day that Paypal is taking its service away from me.  They wouldn't tell me why but I think it's something stupid I did buying on another site.  I am 100% professional on ebay and have never done anything wrong.  So my ebay account is still open and I am still a top-rated seller but I can't sell anything or BUY anything now without paypal.  I am willing to wait  until the new system is put into place.   When the new system is implemented how badly do you think my selling will be affected with not having paypal.   Will I lose craploads of sellers or does no one really know at this point?  What are my other options.  I loved selling on ebay and it was easy.

Ebay,How would you respond to this buyer trying to get free stuff?,"This buyer previously purchased a 3 game bundle from me and said that one of the games didn't work. I ended up partially refunding him about 40% of the purchase price. Then, he buys another 3 game bundle from me and now he's saying none of them work, but isn't cooperating with the return. Here is the full dialog:

Buyer: None of the games worked unfortunately, can I have a refund?

Seller: Sorry you're having issues with the games. I tested all three before I sent them out, I wonder if there's an issue with your console? Anyway, no worries, I will take care of this for you. Just open up a return on eBay and I'll get you a label.

Buyer: Do you really want me to ship you back the games I promise on everything they don’t work trust me I wanted them too. :(

Seller: Yeah, it'll only take a couple days. When I get the games back, I will issue a full refund for you.

Buyer: I’ve never shipped anything before, usually if the game didn’t work they just give me my refund.

Buyer: I might as well do what you did and sell the games acting like they work and scam people because I’m not spending 4$ on shipping and wasting a off day to ship a broken item that was 17$.

Seller: I'm sorry for the inconvenience. You don't have to pay for the label, I've already provided one for you. If you would prefer, you can arrange for the post office to pick up the package if you don't want to go to the post office. The form is online. Also, I didn't intentionality sell games that weren't in working condition. All three of those games were tested and working before shipment. As the games and consoles continue to age, the defect rate starts to go up. The best I can do is test the games and guarantee they work with a full refund.

Buyer: What slip, how do I return it?

Seller: If you go into the return, the label should be there. They also should have emailed it to you and sent it to your messages.

Buyer: Can you just hook it up on a refund without the inconvenience please

Buyer: I don’t have a printer to print the return label

I'm considering sending this:

&gt;Unfortunately, there's not much I can do about that. This is the return process on eBay. If you want to continue with the refund, you'll need to send the item back by the date specified in the return details. eBay gives plenty of time to make arrangements. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do  

A part of me want's to just ignore it and let him either choose to continue with the return or let it expire. I'm wondering what approach you guys would have in this situation.

Ebay,Do I have to accept a return for an item that was as described ?,"A couple weeks ago I bought a used window switch for my car off eBay hoping it would fix my window not always working but it ended up being the motor not the switch. I posted the part that I had taken off my car and someone bought it. Now the buyer wants to return the part he took of his car for a refund because it ended up being the motor and not the switch but I don’t think it’s fair. When I bought the same part for the same exact issue I bought it knowing that it might not be the problem. I’m not an eBay store I’ve been a member for over 10 years and have sold maybe 5 or 6 items total. 

He said the item worked fine it just didn’t fix the problem. The only way I would be willing to accept a refund without being forced into it is if he paid return shipping and I got to subtract what it cost me to ship it. I already had to eat the cost of the item when I bought it plus the price to have it put on plus the price of a new motor and labor for that and I know it’s not his problem which is why I don’t think it’s fair I should have to eat the cost of it not working for him too because that’s not my problem. 

I have over 950 feedback at 100% but all but maybe 5 are as a buyer not a seller so I don’t even care if I get a negative at this point if it means not getting ripped off. I rarely sell anything because I’m tired of eBay allowing sellers to get ripped off left and right. I haven’t responded yet I wanted to see what options I have. If I have to call ebay and talk to someone on the phone to try and stop them from allowing the buyer to return even thoug I state no returns and even though they admitted it was 100% functional and it’s not even the part I sold. Like I said id accept a return if I didn’t loose money on it but I already spent $80 on the part and labor for me, I’m not gonna lose money for him too. He can do what I did and resell his own part.

Ebay,Buyer bought a new with defects item and is mad about said defects that were stated.,"Hi all, I recently sold a brand new with defects sweater. I included clear photos of the defects which was a missing ""lace"" in a lace up detail. I also mentioned that the sweater ran small, and was possibly a size small rather than a medium. (note the word POSSIBLY). I included in writing the measurements, as well as photos of the measuring tape.

Buyer is unhappy. Says it's missing the clearly stated lace for the lace up detail and is way too small.

I wrote back to them that I'm sorry they are unhappy, that all of the above was stated in writing as well as in photos, and asked them to get back to me after referring back to the auction. So now I am waiting either for their response or a hastily written negative feedback. What can I do? I don't think ebay cares about sellers last time I checked.

Did I handle this right? They asked if they can return it (edit- I didn't even reply to that part of their message, because I feel it is important to make my reply about the fact that all they are stating was clearly shown/stated, THEN take it from there). Honestly I'm thinking just refund them the money and let them keep it because I'm not going to bother selling it if this is going to happen. I was thinking of asking if they'd accept a full refund minus shipping.

Ebay,No reason to sell on ebay as a casual seller,"I'm just venting my frustrations.

I'm not a power seller. I'm under 2000 for my entire ebay life actually. I recently sold an item without a return policy. The buyer received the item, regretted the purchase and wanted to return. So, as the typical BS that ebay allows, the buyer lied in the their return reason to force a return. I called ebay and talked to a very nice, although, usless CSR. She told me even though they can see the messages where the buyer clearly states they made a mistake and just don't want the item any longer, there is nothing they can do. The item will be force returned. There is no consequence to the buyer for lying or abusing the system. I'll be out that shipping, the items depreciation and also more time to resell.

&amp;#x200B;

It is honestly a broken system that is set up to be abused. I have been jilted so many times on eBay but this one is my last one. Rather take 50% selling on Facebook than on here anymore.

Ebay,Concerned an order from China is to copy my product,"EDIT: Just found this on their main page “We have 8 years experience making molds and custom tooling for parts.

Original post below:

I manufacture (3D print) an accessory product I designed  and sell it on eBay and Amazon. Sales have been brisk and has kept my printer running day and night. 

The price undercuts the “official” accessory (please note my design is totally different and lacks functionality of the official accessory, but is good enough for most end users. I am just trying to say that it’s not a copy or rip off.) 

I just received an order from China, and when looking at the buyer’s store, I see that all they sell are new/used/refurbished parts for the type of item I am selling. I am concerned they may be purchasing with the intent to copy and manufacture themselves. 

Am I being paranoid? Is there anything I can do to protect myself? I am leaning toward canceling the order and blocking international sales.

thinking to myself ""what is he talking about???"" so i review the listing and all that and the invoice and realize I accidentally put free shipping

on the item and that I charged shipping on the invoice. Alright so no problem, it's been 5 minutes and he's probably waiting for a response, I'll just

explain the situation and offer to fix it and that it was an accident (which I get may or may not look like i'm trying to scam him but still)

ELSE"" (He's bluffing because ebay takes like 2 HOURS TO RESPOND TO A CALL) So I go and attempt to calm him down once more and cancel

the transaction.  then I'm like ""well he has a reason to be mad"" in my head so I message him again VERY KINDLY saying that i'm sorry and

i'm going to re list it for a bit cheaper with free shipping and I apologize once more. Want to know what he says? This dude is like ""learn

proper selling procedures and new sellers are always a hassle and blah blah blah "" basically being a bench over a small mistake and this whole time I've been very kind and respectful

despite being pissed at this dude for trying to strong arm me and he's like ""i'm not interested anymore blah blah blah"" and 5 minutes later

he's like all apologetic now for getting mad and tries to lower the price even more and get free shipping and I just want to say SORRY SUCKA,

SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED MY OFFER BEFORE HAHAHAHHAH, but I know better and ignore him. I re list the item properly and eventually it

sells for the right price all the while this guy is offering like 15$ and 10$ for a 40$ item and keeps messaging me saying ""you said this and

that and i could have it for free or this price"" and whatever man, IGNORED. Anyway if you learned anything from that it's that you don't be nice to

Ebay,Really done right now.,"In my last post, I talked about how I bought a switch and was conned. I made an INR and got a mass message from the seller directed to all of his buyers. Apparently they all bought switches from him and he did the same thing to him. I caught him in a lie as he said he shipped it earlier and sent a notification to me about it yet in the mass message he claims his account has been restricted for days so he hasn’t shipped anything. He instructed us to change our tickets to get a refund.

I tried to and it wouldn’t let me change it so I stupidly closed it thinking I could reopen it and change it to refund and it wouldn’t let me. Realizing I’m out $260 I called eBay who sent me to PayPal then back to eBay then PayPal after two hours they said they opened a ticket again  for my money back but they can’t do anything for four days and to call then

I’m just worried I’m gonna call again in four days they’re not gonna have any idea what I’m talking about. I checked his reviews and he just did it to at least three other people. So basically he’s getting away with our money and eBay has to pay us if I’m lucky which I’m honestly worried I’m screwed since I accidentally closed the ticket.

Ebay,Help with INR (Item Not Received),"Hello. I ordered an item from CA (I live in MA) on March 31st. The tracking page has been stuck on ""shipment received, acceptance pending"" for more than 10 days until last night. It finally updated after I asked the seller about it yesterday. I specifically told the seller to just refund me if he hasn't shipped the item yet, because I need the item soon and can't wait for 5 more days. However, the tracking page updated 10pm yesterday, which led me to believe that he shipped the item anyway. The tracking page says that the item is estimated to arrive on Monday, April 15th.

However, the ebay website still says that the item is estimated to arrive April 6th to April 12th (which is today). So does this mean I can/should still open Item Not Received tomorrow? I am not happy about the service I received at all. I have never seen this kind of delay before (10+ days...) and when I was selling I always shipped the item within one business day. 


Tl;dr: 
1. Seller didn't ship an item for 10+ days. He shipped only after I told him. 
2. Ebay still shows estimated delivery date is April 6th to 12th. The tracking page finally updated after I told him, and it says item will arrive on April 15th. 

My questions are:

1. Can/should I open the INR case? 

2. If I open the INR case tomorrow, but the item arrives on Monday (that is what the tracking page says right now), then what will happen?

3. Can the seller give me negative feedback if I open INR? I have 100% right now and would like to keep that.

Ebay,"Questions about an seller coming to my house ""The package came back"" ""return to sender"" so I brought it myself","Firstly, I don't use ebay and have no idea how it works also I am not the one the package was for but I was the only one who was home, I just showered and was drying myself when the doorbell went off, so I put on some jogging bottoms real quick and went to asnwer.

The guy came to the door and had this container/box in his hand that wasn't wrapped up or anything and said who it was for, I said I can take it as I thought it was just another generic item being delivered so I was happy to take it like normal.

I took it, he said he wanted a pic of me with it to prove he delivered it, I thought this sort of makes sense because otherwise you could just say I never got it and that you want a refund.

I quickly put some more clothes on so there wasn't a random pic of me half dressed, he took the pic and said did I want anymore of the containers, I said no, he said I could have 2 for a deal, I said no again and he left.

* Wasn't for me but I took it to help 
* Took a pic of me to prove it was delivered due to ""return to sender""
* Wasn't wrapped up, no posted signs
* The other containers he tried to sell were also not wrapped up
* He said it came back to him due to not being able to be posted, even though someone is always home and we never got any cards saying you didn't answer and we get post endlessly so always listening out for knocks or rings of the bell

Found out later:

* He refused to have the container collected originally and only would send it by post.
* When an offer was made for two containers originally he declined and said it could only be bought one at a time(suggesting he was just trying to get extra postage money)




Options?
I feel stupid for allowing someone to take my pic and taking it with the item as now it just seems he must be trying to scam people for the extra postage fees.

Is it possible to say to ebay, yeah there is a pic of me with it, but where is the proof of postage? or would ebay just say ""you have it, so there is no need to prove it was posted as you have it and it was delievered""?

Ebay,My eBay Managed Payments nightmare,"Earlier in the year, I made the switch to eBay Managed Payments to replace PayPal. Everything was going great for 3 months after the switch until two weeks ago, eBay has decided to freeze my payouts because they need to 'verify my bank account information'. Since nothing has changed with regard to my name or bank account information, I chose the option to submit a bank statement, which shows my full name, account number and the deposits made by eBay Managed Payments. After 4 days, eBay rejects the bank statement and gives the same non-specific 'we need to verify your bank account information'. A chat with an eBay rep tells me that I need to add my middle initial to my eBay legal name (which is reflected on my bank statement). I do so and re-submit the same bank statement. Today, I receive an email saying my information has been rejected again, except this time the email is addressed to someone named 'Neil'. My name is not Neil... Not even close. At this point I have nearly $800 in limbo because I've still been shipping orders despite not being paid for it. Worse, if the issue is not resolved by May 3rd, I will be subject to 'account restrictions'.

I switched to eBay Managed Payments for the promise of lower transaction fees, but at this point I'd switch back to PayPal in a heartbeat. The reduced fees have been negligible at best. I've used PayPal for years to receive payments without a hint of trouble, now 3 months into eBay's method, my business is paralyzed... An eBay rep tells me that it is not possible to switch back to PayPal until the issue with eBay Managed Payments is resolved...

Ebay,First return request... how do I navigate?,"I sold a Dreamcast game on April 4 and received positive feedback about it a few days later.  Just now I got a return request for the same game ""doesn't match description or photos""

""hi, upon further inspection of this item, It s not in very good condition at all, the disc is heavily scratched. -Center circle of disc is scratched severely with tons of marks. -on the outer edge of the disc there is huge circular mark that goes all the way around. I ve tested the game and it works, but I m a little disappointed with the condition. Definitely not very good , or even good to be honest. Acceptable to some, maybe? I m sorry to ask for a return or maybe a partial refund, but It s in pretty rough shape! Sorry.""

I don't know the best way to go about this, it sounds like he's fishing for a partial refund.  I got bad vibes from this buyer since he also sells Sega stuff and recently sold the same game to some other person a few days before he bought the game off me.  The photos he provided don't look too bad and it's possible that it could be the game I sold, but he used lighting to bring out every flaw in the disc.  It's also possible he's trying to swap his bad copy for my good copy.

The game was sent as lettermail within Canada, so I'm not sure how I provide a return label.  What should I do?  I know eBay weighs on the buyer's side, but is there anyway I can minimize my losses?  Also, all my items are ""No Returns"" but I don't think that matters.

I offered him a partial of $5.00 or a full refund upon return of the item. What happens if he doesn't respond back and lets the case expire? Will eBay decide in my favor? The game was $40.00 with free shipping. I called eBay and they opened a case when I told them not to and now my only option is to offer a refund.

Ebay,Doesn't even Ebay themselves follow their policy anymore?,"Tell me your opinion on my recent ebay experience. I bought a Nokia phone from ebay. Pictures show the nokia 6 2018 model but the seller sent the 2017. After endless discussions and after Ebay postponed  their decision date twice, they decided i am responsible for returning the item back and there is no appeal option either. 

Seller is UK based and i live in Cyprus and the shipping costs 30 Euros. Postal services in Cyprus won't handle lithium batteries so the only option is courier service which is 30 Euros.

So if the item is the wrong model than the listing pictures and ebay's policy states its the sellers responsibility to cover return shippin costs, isn't ebay against their policy by asking me to pay for these costs? Hasn't even customer service take time to see the listing pictures are wrong? Never mind the fact that the seller lists the item as mint-like new when in fact it has pry tool marks which means its refurbished.

Do you have any thoughts or advice? 
Thanks and sorry for the long post.

..

UPDATE 1: I spoke with Ebay UK service and they told me the system shows he sent me a payment so that must be the reason of the outcome. I explained that the post office wouldn't offer economy choice for smartphones so i had to choose courier service and i refunded the seller explaining him and asking to arrange prepaid label or after a market research i found the cheapest courier for 32Euros. 
So after this explanation the Ebay employer said he will forward this to the US team because i opened the case from ebay US and now i am waiting for 24-48 hours he said it would take.

..

UPDATE 2!: Ebay has placed the case back on hold. When Ebay decided against me without option for appeal i told the seller i don't like the decision but i have no option and i will be sending the item at my own cost. So i asked him his return address of choice because he has an ""out of office"" status.
He asked for my whatsapp number promising that he will call me to help me save the cost that i was now responsible. Since i had no option for appeal i thought i have nothing to lose giving him my number since maybe he has some advice or other options. He said he will be calling me the next day. Of course he never did and in the meantime i had the chat with customer service in UPDATE 1.
Today the case was put back on hold and guess what? Seller started emailing me again. He sent me 3 messages replying with short messages including the word ""whatsapp"" and phone ""call"". I suspect he is trying to get the conversation flagged as violating Ebay's policy to end it or something.
I replied that he should not call me and we will be talking from Ebay messages only and that it was a mistake to give him my phone number in the first place by his request. I hope Ebay doesn't hold me solely responsible for this violation. Things got complicated. Any comments on this mistake i did?",10,18,2019-04-16,EBAY,0.09419979155063629,0.8809896111488342,0.02481059916317463

Ebay,Sellers who use vehicle compatibility: Caution possible bug,"I've noticed more and more lately, until it's now nearly constant, that if I have specified parts compatibility for the various vehicles something fits, use ""sell similar"" and then change the compatibility it doesn't take.

e.g. I post a part that fits 65-68 mustang, with those selected under compatibility. Then 'sell similar' off that for a part that fits 65-67 and I 'uncheck' 68... That one unchecks, but the listing still shows 65-68 after I save it.

I've already had a couple unfortunate instances where a customer ignored my title/description, went off that wrong compatibility and ordered a part that didn't fit.

The only workaround I've found is to go into the third column: the model years, and uncheck it there, not at the 'top level'... that seems to work/take... for now.

I called ebay and was told by a rep that since I stated in my listing no refunds or returns I am not obligated to issue one out. I got a reference number and the reps name. 

I replied to buyer with the above and also told him since the box came in poor condition, it looks like he needs to contact his local post office as the package was securely shipped on my end. 

He has replied he contact me back soon once he receives a response from the post office.",32,26,2019-04-20,EBAY,0.06052226200699806,0.9098862409591675,0.02959146350622177

Ebay,Psychological Sales Tactics - Share yours here,"It's always nice, as a seller, when one of your sales tactics works right away - even better when 2 work in conjunction!

Yesterday we raised the price (to $120) on an item that had been sitting with multiple watchers while the price went down. At about 2am we got an offer for $70 with the message ""Ready to buy"". It's a bit insulting to get an offer over 40% below asking, in a ""do you really think that's reasonable?"" way (especially when they had a chance to get it lower but wanted to wait for an even lower price), but at 2 am, I just rolled my eyes and decided to wait until the morning to decide on a counter or decline.

10 minutes later, that same item was purchased at the full (raised) asking price. A watcher saw an open offer and didn't want to miss his chance. So we sold an item for more than we thought we could by using some psychological marketing.



1. Price dropping/raising. If a buyer sees the price consistently going down, they'll wait for it to reach their desired price without acting. If they see the price go up, they'll get worried about it going higher and try to cash out early. Sometimes raising your price actually works.

2. FOMO. If a buyer sees someone else interested in the same item, they're more likely to buy it right away for fear of missing out on limited stock. If you ignore an open offer rather than declining right away, you'll create a higher sense of demand.



What other tactics do you sellers use to get inside the buyer's head?",19,7,2019-04-20,EBAY,0.04252307862043381,0.8981514573097229,0.059325411915779114

Ebay,How do you keep track of your sales and money?,"I'm using Google sheets right now and I'm liking it, but I'm wondering if I'm overworking myself. Right now I have one sheet, and I am listing literally EVERY item. As soon as I get home for sourcing, the items get loaded into the sheet.

When something sells, I add the date/price, etc, and have my profit that way. Right now I have hundreds of items in this sheet and only about 30 sales... So it feels like I have done a bunch of work for no reason....

The main reason I do it this way is because I get the cost of goods from the items before I remove the tag and list it, so I always know what each item cost... Plus, I keep a running total of the blank 'sale date' cells in a column to keep track of how many items I have on hand... Maybe not necessary... 

I've seen spreadsheets that do not have this much info. Sellers leave it blank until the item sells, THEN they add the cost of goods, etc...

TL,DR.... Am I making my Google sheets too bulky? What's the best way to keep track of NECESSARY information without bloating the sheet?",13,7,2019-04-20,EBAY,0.04265473410487175,0.9303011298179626,0.02704416587948799

Ebay,EBay relisted GTC items before 30 days,"My wife, like everyone else, was upset about eBay's new GTC relisting so she had planned to cancel her auctions a day before they relisted. When she went to do it today, the 29th day, they had already been relisted. Did they seriously anticipate everyone doing this and relisted stuff early?

My wife has been selling on eBay for 20 years. And for 20 years she's watched eBay implement one anti-seller policy after another after another.  Tonight she has finally had it and deleted every single listing and vowed to never sell on eBay again.

It amazes me that a business that relies on sellers can be so unfriendly with their seller policies. And it shows, there was a time when you could find anything on eBay. Now it's hard to find anything that isn't bulk produced in China.

Edit: I must add that it is actually almost 22 years loyal to ebay and she had to stop her auctions due to a surgery next wee. Also, wow at those downvotes on the comments here.",7,3,2019-04-20,EBAY,0.06054191291332245,0.9100699424743652,0.029388105496764183
Ebay,What Step is My Package In?,"Hello, everyone this is going to be a similar post to alot of here but I'm just trying to better understand the shipment chain of a product coming from China to the USA. 

My job requires me to be out of town for long stretches so I most likely I won't be around when I receive my package and I'll probably have to have a friend 5 hours away come pick it up off my porch so I want to telegraph this punch. 

The package was shipped on Wednesday and I think I understand the international shipping process but I got the ""Preparing Shipment"" update through tracking and then it changed to "" processing through facility"" again and has yet to change for the past few days. I'm not worried, from what I read this is probably due to Customs, so I'm curious what step of process am I in. Did my package clear customs and it's on the plane over, or is it still in customs? I hear it takes a while to clear customs sometimes so if I have cleared that hurdle, I figure I can narrow when my friend has to come in down to a day or two. If not then my timeframe is still a bit murky

Ebay,When a buyer legit screws up...,"So, I got a message about a large, heavy, local-pick-up item I have listed for a couple thousand dollars.  The guy is interested, but would have to drive several hours to see the item and make a final decision.    
I told him that I can negotiate on the price and I could offer him some related extras, outside of the eBay deal. (Things I have never listed.)  


He responded with more expressions of interest, but then sent his phone number through eBay messages. (Using ""One2ThReE"" format.) and said he's not that experienced with eBay.  


I responded that I have no interest in cutting eBay out of any fees for what I've listed, but that he wouldn't be liable for any fees as a buyer anyway.  

&amp;#x200B;

If I was selling an iPhone buyer from Nigeria or something, I'd just block him from contacting me again, but I think this is just someone who doesn't understand eBay.   I've had this item up for almost a year, so I don't want to lose a legit sale.    
He's using a brand new account, but that could be because he's never used eBay before.  


The thing is, it's local pickup, so he will bring cash and I can let eBay get their fees by doing everything correctly on my end.  


(I'm not worried about getting robbed, either, as the item is in a secure storage facility with automatic code-locked parking areas and security cameras.)  


So, I guess the question is, because he tried to go around eBay, are they going to flag my account for fraud or anything?

Ebay,Seller accidentally refunded the whole purchase price,"I'm not asking what I should morally or ethically do in this instance.

Nearly a month ago I bought an item as an anniversary gift. I made sure to purchase it with enough time for it to arrive before the date I needed it by. The seller took his time shipping it out and when he finally did he didn't bother to enter the tracking into transaction, so well over a week went by where I was wondering what was going on. I was getting ready to contact him when I got the USPS notice that it would be arriving in a few days.

When it finally arrived, I went to test the item out, so as to not give a defective gift, and I found that it was missing the external power supply, the instruction manual, and another  detachable wire that connects some of the various pieces together. For reference, the item was described as being 'Like new' and 'Complete', so all of these things definitely should have been included.

I contacted the seller immediately and but didn't hear back from until the next day when he said he'd 'look around' and left it at that. I expected to hear from him within a few hours, but I did not. So I wrote him that night asking for an update and letting him know this item was an anniversary gift that I would need to give soon, but he didn't respond again until the next day. When he did, he said he couldn't find the manual and he would send me an aftermarket power supply and wire he had that would work but not the factory originals as he couldn't find them.

Two more days went by without any updates or messages from him. Now so much time had passed that even if he shipped the items out the next day they would not arrive by when I needed them. I wrote him and asked for a partial refund so I could buy the OEM replacement parts locally, but he refused. He said I was being unreasonable and he would send me the aftermarket parts when he got around to it and that was all he was obligated to do as a seller.

Frustrated, I told him that I'd rather just send me back and buy brand new one from a store than to continue dealing with his delays. He responded saying that I was being rude to him and that he did not appreciate it. Mind you, it's now been several weeks since I purchased the item, I'm still unable to test it out, and I bought it including OEM parts only, but somehow I'm the one being rude by expecting the item I paid for in a reasonable amount of time.

The seller agrees to let me send the item back, however once he realizes that he would get stuck paying the return shipping he changes his mind about issuing me the partial refund. Since buying OEM parts locally would be easier than returning the item in the long run and as it's what I wanted to do in the first place, I agree to the partial refund that I had originally suggested. Nothing crazy. Nothing extra. The literal cost of the items only, and I'd just deal with never having the instruction manual. Hopefully my spouse wouldn't need it either.

So he says he sent the refund and when I check my account I see that it's for the full purchase price and not the small amount that I asked him to send me. Had this person been apologetic in any way, acted like he cared, felt remorseful in the slightest, or even just pretending to give a lone, single shit for the sake cordiality, then I would have sent him the cash back immediately. He didn't care about me as a buyer, so I don't care about him as a seller. Sorry; not sorry. Again, I'm not asking the moral or ethical thing to do. I'm just wondering if I can tell him to 'Eat shit' when he eventually contacts me about this or not.

tl;dr - Exceptionally rude seller sent incomplete item, didn't care, and then accidentally refunded the total price. Wat do?

Ebay,"Won item by being the highest bidder, I pay, the seller then cancels the purchase and relists the same item for double what I paid for it","Hi guys, as the title says I won an item by being the highest bidder, and I paid immediately. 

This was last night. 

This morning I wake up and my purchase has been cancelled and I was issued a refund. 

I then get a message from the seller saying that the Tablet I had bought is actually more expensive, as it was a cell + WiFi model. 

So he re-listed it for more than double what I paid for it. He offered me a 10% discount and that he would throw in a free case with it. 

My first thought was “okay, this comes off as a scam to me.” 

I also thought it was against eBay policy to put an item up for purchase and then rescind it due to it actually being a more expensive item, I’m not sure. 

I responded that I was not interested, and where I now realize I could have been nicer in my wording, I told him that this comes off as a tactic to get more money, and that I don’t trust him in this situation. 

I then get a reply calling me entitled and that I did the bare minimum and it goes on and on. 

Was I wrong to immediately think it was a scam?

I live in a townhouse, there are no docks to speak of here, and none of my neighbors are named Liney. There's no 'community' mailbox, just my personal regular box out in front like a standard US house. 

I know eBay/the seller will say ""It has tracking! I did my part!"" Which i respect, but I also don't like paying $25 for literally nothing. I'm thinking now of the horrors of people paying hundreds of dollars for the same thing to happen with no recourse because tracking.

So /r/eBay, what are my options? It was bought via PayPal credit (default) so there's no real recourse through my bank as if were my credit card where i can dispute a charge. Should I contact ups? 

I'll also add, I contacted the seller twice now over 10 days about any additional info or tracking, and he never replied. 

Thanks.



***EDIT***
I called UPS, and was told while my tracking number was a Valid tracking number to my town, however the item description, name, and address we're 100% NOT my address nor item. They even told me it's not a standard eBay tracking number (if that is a thing). The 'Liney' who recieved it was the last name on the recipient address, so UPS said it just looked like a wrong tracking number I was given, as everything matched for them. 

With that I called eBay, told them the info was totally wrong, and that either the tracking info was incorrect or I was given a fake tracking ID. They asked if I wanted to wait more for the seller to reply, but after 10 days I'm not waiting any longer; they refunded me my $25.


Is this a new form of fraud? Are fraudulent sellers finding tracking numbers to the same town/date and using that as an extra layer of protection? Thoughts on that?",17,5,2019-04-23,EBAY,0.08981483429670334,0.8863463401794434,0.023838801309466362

Ebay,Lost a $1500 package in JERSEY CITY NJ NETWORK DISTRIBUTION CENTER,"Hi, I have a package valued at $1500(a brand new MacBook Pro) was lost in JERSEY CITY NJ NETWORK DISTRIBUTION CENTER. It is a priority mail which was sent on March 21st from Portland to NJ. When I checked the tracking history, I find the package has been arrived in JERSEY CITY NJ NETWORK DISTRIBUTION CENTER  since March 30th. In the first days, I would get some e-mail notification from USPS saying the package will be late. But I even didn't get such notification now. I filed a USPS Missing Mail claim and got a reply from a staff as below: 

""Unfortunately, your item was processed manually at the Jersey City processing plant. Therefore, we do not have sorting details available that would allow us to share where this item was headed to afterwards to be able to continue our search.  However, we have flagged your tracking number so that we can capture it if it is run through our processing plant mail stream again. At this time, I would advise that you contact the sender and request that they file an insurance claim online at [USPS.com](https://USPS.com), under Help, File a Claim. You can also file a missing mail search on [USPS.com](https://USPS.com), under Help, Find Missing Mail.""

Unfortunately, I didn't buy insurance for it because I never lost any packages with USPS Priority Mail before (Now I know this is very stupid ). So even if I file a claim, I cannot get it full covered. I bought the item using my Citi Costco card and tried to file a claim via the credit card Lost and Theft Protection benefit but was told they could only cover stolen items(not lost items). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, can anybody help me with what the best way for me to get the package back at this time? Do you think the package was stolen or completely lost? Can I file a report with police department to get a proof of stolen so that I can get covered by the credit card insurance?

Then he says to please send a replacement and refund. 

I’m a bit confused because he wants a replacement AND a refund, so I feel like he’s just trying to get an extra CD for free and the original one for free as well. I’m worried that he’ll leave me negative feedback if I don’t accept his request for a refund and replacement.

To my horror, in the 8 minutes it took to reboot my laptop to finish the revision, someone bought it. I started to message them to tell them that I made a mistake and then got the notification that they paid for it while I was typing the new message (this all happened in a span of 8 minutes). So then I finished the message, offered a full refund, an honest apology, and even offered to give them a discount on other items I am selling as a peace offering. 

It's been 36 hours and they havent responded to the message. I dont know whether to ship the bowl or to cancel the order. I fear that cancelling would result in a negative feedback and would much rather work with the buyer (I'd rather give the bowl for free than get a neg) but I cant get in contact with them. 

I know, I'm an idiot, but I'm trying to make it right.

Ebay,"Out of the ordinary return issue, what would you do?","Sorry for the throwaway account, I had trouble logging into my usual one under u/3domfighter

I normally only sell collectible items on eBay, but sold some old personal items recently. One was a Bose Companion 5 subwoofer that had been in use and was working perfectly.  It sold for $51 at NR auction, but the shipping came to $64 because the guy lives in Puerto Rico (of course!)

This buyer has 22 feedback, asked a bunch of questions about the unit AFTER the auction ended, and the icing on the cake is that they don't speak English.  

Last night I get a message that the unit has arrived, but it doesn't work and they said they feel they are being ""cheated.""  Maybe that put me on the defensive, but I stayed calm, told them I have no intention of cheating them, and I asked a few questions about how and where they were hooking it up.  From a cursory Google search it seemed like there could be a lot of reasons it would appear to not work, but was just connected incorrectly.

The language barrier was a problem, but I speak Spanish so I offered to converse in Spanish.  No, he only speaks Chinese.  Well, I don't, so I keep trying to work through the problem.  

I understand that something could have happened in transit, and I didn't buy insurance, so that would be on me.  The last thing I want to do is have them ship it back to me at my expense (since they claim it is broken I'd have to pay).  So my plan was to ask them to send me a quick video demonstrating what is broken.  I realize it's super easy to fake this, but at least I'm not just taking their word for it.  Normally I'd have no problem taking their word for it, but the low feedback and the weird questions after the auction seem suspicious to me.  They refuse to send a video.

What would you all do?  I'm tempted to just refund their purchase price and see if that makes them happy, but if it truly arrived DOA I should refund their shipping, also.  I'd love to get it back so I can inspect it myself, but I don't want to pay another $64 shipping charge even if it does work.  I fear that my best option is to refund their purchase and shipping costs, then let them do whatever they want with the item.  Which I suspect may have been their plan all along.  Am I being overly suspicious about this?

Thanks in advance for your advice!  I'm glad something finally led me to this sub, and I can't believe I never thought to look for it before.  Great posts!

EDIT TO ADD AN UPDATE:
I didn't want to pay $65 to ship the thing home, especially if it was broken. I suspected that was his game from the start, anyway.  What I decided to do was I looked up a local PC repair store in his city and I set up the return to go to that address. Only cost me around $10. Then I sent him a note that said,

""I have sent you a shipping label. You will send it to a local computer store and they will tell me if it works or not. If it doesn't work, you get a refund. If it does work, I will file a faulty return claim with eBay and you will not get a refund.""

He has suddenly decided not to return the item! A huge waste of my time, but I learned a lot about buyers with low feedback, and my success was a direct result of help from this sub.

Ebay,Issues with EBay need help!!!,"Hello community I’m seeking help!!!!
After recently selling an item to a buyer, without contacting me the buyer opened a return request. After the buyer returned the item I noticed it was not in the condition is sent it in. I contacted eBay and used my seller protection. It was not until later looking closer at the item I noticed it was not the item I sent but one that was the same. Realizing I was used to obtain a replacement I called eBay to ensure it was noted on the case. To late the appeal had been denied, but because after filling out the affidavit and filing under Seller protection, they would review it because it was not looked at under the seller protection category. So the result is that EBay will do a manual refund to me. 5/7 days. The result after waiting for money that has not come is it was denied based on a restriction on the account. 
No one knows why it’s there or when it was placed there. They removed it and then put it back repeatedly.  They closed the case and promised a curtesy refund but can’t send it because of the restriction no one can tell me
What it is, why it’s there or anymore information. 
Lots of broken promises from eBay to call me within 25 hours. I’m angry at this point it’s been 2 months. When I do get the odd call they know nothing of the case and want to talk about my appeal. I speak to 3-6 people per call.

Ebay,Does anyone else feel hesitant to continue selling on eBay?,"I’ve been an eBay seller for over a year now and I haven’t had much problems. However, I’ve recently (and in the past) seen a lot of posts in this subreddit about bad experiences other eBay sellers had. 

The posts mainly talked about how sellers are at the mercy of the buyers. Plus, posts mentioned how INAD cases were almost always misused. I understand the need for the INAD option for the buyer , but I feel that the seller is at a disadvantage. 

In my own experience I had a couple of items that sold but buyers decided to not pay for them. I opened up cases after 48 hrs had passed. I still had to wait an additional few days before I got the listing back up and my final selling fee refunded ( eBay’s seller fee ). 
I had a bunch of watchers on the item listing , but after this happened I had to re-list the item from scratch. 

I called eBay support during this 4-5 day process and I question what would happen to the buyer for not paying. The answer ? Nothing. They get some type of mark of their account and after a FEW of these marks they cannot purchase items with the account for a limited time. 

I have a lot of items that I wanted to continue selling on eBay , but now I’m worried that I may lose my product and my profit. 

Is anyone else feeling the same way or am I missing something here?",24,8,2019-04-30,EBAY,0.5623096823692322,0.4201962649822235,0.017494041472673416
Ebay,"Suspect misrepresented item location (item late). Opinion on tracking, suggestions?","I have seen stories of china based sellers making up stories to delay/confuse buyers.  The communications doesn't quite add up. I haven't used eBay much for buying, and it's been years since I sold. 
  
I purchased an item said location was USA, same state as me on 4/20, estimated arrival 4/25-4/29.  Items ""from China"" from other sellers had estimated arrival window ending at 5/05. 
  
Seller attached UPS tracking number on 4/27.  UPS tracking number detail shows Label Created (In a different state than ""Item Location"") after ""Origin Scan"" and then the next day shows that UPS has not received the package.  The weight shown is also &lt;1/5th of what the order weighs.
  
UPS tracking detail:
""In Transit	04/27/2019 3:00 A.M. 	Lexington, KY, United States	
Your package was not received at the UPS facility as originally scheduled. There may be a delivery delay. 

Past Event	Shipped	04/26/2019 2:15 P.M. 	Lexington, KY, United States	
Origin Scan 

Past Event	Label Created	04/26/2019 2:19 P.M. 	United States	
Order Processed: Ready for UPS""   
  
Requested info from seller on the 28th, because 29th was last arrival estimate and tracking showed not received by UPS yet.  
Seller reply ""We have contacted AMZ for this issues, and we will get back to you asap. 

And also, if you didn't receive all of the 5 brackets on May 5, 2019, we promise will issue a half refund to you and you can keep the items.

Please accept our sincerely apology again. This really the first time that taking so long time for delivery.""  
  
I inquired what AMZ mean, seller replied that means Amazon and seller ""would refund me half for the late shipment"".  
  
Related notes:  
- 3 messages from Seller were just after 8AM/9AM China time (8-9PM EST), my messages were at various time of day.  
- Seller had all listings I saw as USA when I purchased, but there is one that was recently modified on 4/12 that says ""From China"" now.  
- Every single seller feedback (~65) is set to private.  I didn't think much of this originally, because the seller had a limited number of different related items and it was reasonable the prices might change over months.
  
  
What I want to avoid:  Waiting yet another week (3 weeks), then having to sort out refund/ship if SNAD, then having to finally go purchase from elsewhere...  Ending up with a month+ of delay.  That's the main reason I specifically ordered from within my own state rather than international...  Recommendations I see from places where China location is misrepresented is to file INR day after last delivery estimate or they will just delay delay delay and proactively offer partial refunds for positive feedback because they're used to running the scam.   
  
Three questions for people with more recent eBay experience:  
1. Does Amazon warehouses ship for eBay and through UPS?  That seems suspicious claiming that Amazon has the shipment.  I figure it more likely was an accidental reference to one of the AMZ china shipping companies I see on Google, but maybe I'm being paranoid.    
2. Am I correctly assessing UPS shipping status as a 3rd party shipper inputting data and the item not transferring to UPS?  Is this (as I suspect) what it would look like for an overseas shipment?  
3. Should I file INR tomorrow if the tracking hasn't updated so I can move on at the end of the week with re-ordering from a legitimate merchant, or should I wait longer?  If it arrives less than 3 days later and is NOT shipped from China, can I just close the INR without any defect hitting the seller, right?  Or if it arrives less than 3 days later and IS from China, I can close the INR and open a SNAD for the location?  I don't want to hit a seller for a shipper's unexpected slowness, but a misrepresentation will get a Neg FB to warn others and a return.  
  
**Update:**  It gets weirder.  Ebay just sent an email about another tracking number added and now shows shipment 1of2/2of2.  This one shows label created on 4/29 at 2:30am (around 5:30PM in China) and arrival date 5/03....
