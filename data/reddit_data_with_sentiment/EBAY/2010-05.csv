Ebay,Has anyone figured out how to screen out bulk listings?,"For instance, say I just want to find listings where someone is selling an OEM replacement component for a 2008 Audi A3.  Not ""XEON LIGHT KIT 02 03 04 05 06 AUDI A3 A4"" listings, or listings for generic floor mats.

In eBay motors, if I do a broad search, [I get this crap](http://imgur.com/LhFdl.jpg).

I get the feeling that if I restricted it to people with a feedback score of **less than** 500, I would get much better results.  Is there syntax for that?",2,3,2010-05-25,EBAY,0.016202596947550774,0.8745082020759583,0.10928918421268463

Ebay,Weirdest Thing You Have Sold on eBay?,"Some things I have sold: rotting skulls, dirt, dead leaves, sand, rocks, feathers, bat guano, compost, wire, fabric scraps, plastic scraps, broken musical instruments--including ones that had been in nasty water for a year, rags, wild plants(aka WEEDS), skeletal remains of rats, mice, snakes, etc, old jars, broken auto parts, hubcaps, barbwire, ads cut from newspapers and catalogs, pallet strapping(used), dog hair, cattails(the plant!), blackberry cuttings,....the list is endlesssssssssss! Point is, nothing is really trash until the worker puts it in the truck. Think about possibilities before you throw things away, because there is no real ""away"".
