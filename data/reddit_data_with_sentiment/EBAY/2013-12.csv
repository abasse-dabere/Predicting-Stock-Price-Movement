Ebay,How is all the free shipping from Asia possible?,"I very regularly buy things on ebay from Hong Kong/China and very often the shipping to the US is free, even when the purchase total is $0.99!

How can that be?
If purchase a USB micro-sd card reader for $0.99, AND it's shipped over seas, how much did they pay to ship it!?
 I can't even ship a package across the US for $1.
I could understand taking a loss for cheap items, considering that positive feedback is weighted the same, regardless of item price. But so, so many items sell for less than $3 and have free shipping.

I want to ship things cheeply but I can't even compete with items selling for $2 overseas!",12,11,2013-12-01,EBAY,0.04362223669886589,0.8708807229995728,0.08549706637859344

Ebay,[MOD POST] Announcement concerning eBay employee flair.,"Greetings fellow patrons of /r/eBay!

Since April of 2012, I have been a moderator of this subreddit as an employee of eBay Inc. (PayPal). While this has garnered some criticism from the public concerning impartial and potentially censoring moderation to the negative posts about eBay, I have received much support and I feel I have been successful in being impartial and objective to the flavor of this community. 

With my employment, I have been able to confirm other eBay employees and assign flair to recognize these users for their expertise on eBay related subject matter. Recently, I have completed my bachelor's program in an IT field and have accepted an offer of employment with another company. Since I will be leaving PayPal, I will no longer be able to verify these eBay employees an thus, unwilling to assign appropriate employee badges.

With that being said, I ask of you to decide whether recognizing eBay employees should stand as it is, which would require assigning a current employee as a new mod for this purpose or, getting rid of it altogether.

My last day is on December 13th, at which time I will remove my [](/PP) flair and make the appropriate changes/removal to the remaining employee flair based on the consensus here. Should a new mod be assigned, I will make a decision based on post history as I do not know the other employees personally.

I know this may not seem like a big deal to most of you, but I feel that the employee redditors have been a great help and it deserves a bit of attention.

Respectfully,

Me

*Edit:* Ok. Some of you have voiced your opinion and it sounds mostly in favor of keeping the flair. I will need volunteers from our employee pool who are willing to moderate.

*Edit 2:* I have three prospects currently. It will take me a few days to come to a decision which will be announced in another stickied post.",12,12,2013-12-02,EBAY,0.05199433118104935,0.9110711812973022,0.0369345061480999

Ebay,How will paypal protection work with potential high risk sellers?,"Hello,

I've seen a few collectibles go on eBay now from sellers in places like the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Israel with 5-20 feedback at most that tend to attract a very small number of bidders. On items that cost between 50-200 dollars, what kind of risk am I putting on myself by choosing to bid on these kind of auctions?

Some of these sellers claim to wait up to 6 weeks for delivery because of how slow mail system is, and I am having a difficult time gauging if that means it is going to be very easy to forget and miss out on the window to open a case if necessary.

I seem to recall some scams in the past on preselling new products just far enough in advance that you lose the ability to open a case and then they never send the item.

Am I misunderstanding how the buyer protection works? Based on what I read, it sounds like I can recklessly buy high end items from people with no feedback from countries with weak mail fraud laws and paypal will not only protect me, but is lopsidedly in the favor of a buyer.",1,2,2013-12-02,EBAY,0.07793071866035461,0.8928819298744202,0.029187316074967384

Ebay,Fast USPS insurance claim,"Just thought I'd share with you the experience I had doing my first USPS insurance claim in the last 10 years since it might be helpful to someone else in the same situation.

Last month I sold a computer phone server for about $150 that I packaged well with bubble wrap and shipped in a large box but it somehow arrived with a busted circuit board in the power supply. Was probably dropped really hard at an angle and the torque snapped the board at the corner.

It was shipped priority mail for about $24,  and I got $100 free insurance and insured it for the $100 which was less than the total cost but I didn't want to pay to insure the rest.

Buyer was nice enough to send me pictures showing the damage and I filed a claim on USPS.com and uploaded the images as well as links to both other ebay auctions and non-ebay websites that showed the item was worth more than what I was asking in insurance.

Ebay,"Global Shipping Program not showing estimate to buyer, telling them to contact seller.","Hi all,

I have listed an item for sale through the global shipping program and with free domestic shipping in the US. This particular item will be sent in a USPS medium flat rate box domestically.

I have never used the GSP before as a new seller but I got a question from a UK buyer wanting to know an estimate of his total cost after all shipping, handling, and customs charges. I thought to myself ""I thought eBay handles all of this stuff with the GSP"" so I went to ebay.co.uk and found my item. Under ""Postage and Payments,"" it says 

&gt;**""This item will post to United Kingdom, but the seller hasn't specified postage options. Contact the seller and request a postage method to your location.""**

I am wondering why it says this instead of giving them an estimate. I have been scouring eBay help pages as well as this subreddit. I have gone back into my listing and it says the following:

&gt;U.S shipping
&gt;Flat: same cost to all buyers
&gt;Services
&gt;Standard Shipping (1 to 5 business days) - Free shipping
&gt;Handling time : 1 business day
&gt;International shipping
&gt;You're sending to the US shipping center using the Global Shipping Program.
&gt;Alternative international shipping options
&gt;No alternative international shipping
&gt;Exclude shipping locations
&gt;Excluded Locations : No locations are excluded

So I am not sure what exactly I am doing wrong to set up the program and why it won't give my buyer an estimate.

Ebay,Ebay Buyer Scamming me!! Help??,"On Nov. 18th i sold a kidrobot x simpson bumblebee man vinyl figure to the highest bidder for $275. I shipped it 2-3 day shipping with USPS shipping confirmation, $300 insurance and i quickly updated the info on ebay. The item was received and signed for Nov. 20. The next day the buyer files a ""item not as described"" claim never even contacting me. I find out because of the email ebay sends me. I then call ebay but to no avail. As per the conversation with the ebay person i asked the seller through their messaging system what was the issue. He calimed and posted that i sent him a Lisa figure instead (a steep difference in price by about $260). 

Well even though in the original sale listing i posted a picture of ALL my simpson x kidrobot figures, and i still have my ONLY 2 Lisa's ebay didnt care that he ""may be "" lying. The ebay person had the audacity to ask me if i took a picture of me packing it in the post office in front of employees to verify the item and then sent it out, i said no and she acted like i was crazy for not doing that. 

Well i replied to the buyer stating that we both know he is lying and that i have a video of me packing it in the post office with people verifying it and if he tries to continue the bs claim i will pursue him with the authorities. I thought he fell from my bluff as i sent that on Nov. 22 well now today, without any contact from him once i sent that, he escalated it with ebay and in a matter of hours they decided in his favor and will issue the full refund once he provides tracking that the item has been sent back and received by me!

Ebay,I think I've fallen prey to the ebay terms and conditions about the Global Shipping Program.,"All my items I select as shipping only to the United States. It also says it in my item description, but I've realized no one reads those apparently. So I just sold a $5 skirt and when I went to send the invoice it said the buyer was in Malta.

Apparently I'm one of the many people who never realized that accepting ebay's terms meant signing up for the Global Shipping Program. I want nothing to do with international shipping after all the horror stories I've read about. I emailed the buyer (before I realized this) and told her I didn't ship outside the United States. I'm waiting for a reply and hoping for the best, but considering the horrendous state of ebay now days, I'm assuming the worst. Best case scenario is she'll understand (I can always dream), what would be the worst case scenario? I'm not sure what to expect or what I'll have to do. Could ebay make me send it to that GSP center in Kentucky? The invoice says her address in Malta, so I'm not even sure how that would work. I'm not a brand new seller, just a casual seller.

Ebay,What is my best course of action (I'm the seller and items aren't being tracked),"Saturday night I sold two different SNES games to two different people in NJ. Obviously I waited until Sunday to pack the items (I used 2 small flat rate boxes), and brought them to the post office Monday around 9 AM  (I handed them to an employee behind the counter). The employee did not scan the items, but they hardly ever do....and it hasn't been an issue....

However it is now Wednesday and the only thing listed on the tracking page at USPS is ""Electronic Shipping Info Received"" for both packages. I sent messages to both buyers last night (Tuesday) letting them know when I dropped off the package on Monday, and that if nothing updates on USPS today (Wednesday) I'll head down to the post office and see whats up.

I honestly don't know if the post office will be able to help at all.... mainly because they have no proof they ever accepted the package.

So what should I do? How long should I wait before I issue a refund (The sellers paid for 2 to 3 day shipping)? I'm also kinda new to ebay and really don't want any negative reviews.... but it might be unavoidable at this point =/

What if anything should I do different in the future?",8,0,2013-12-04,EBAY,0.07281898707151413,0.9010680317878723,0.026112988591194153
Ebay,"Rather new to the selling game, now I'm wondering what the hell is with these apparently-hidden fees.","I've been selling for about a month. Old coins are all so far.

I've made about $70 in November.

Tonight I received an email from eBay alerting me of an invoice, with a total amount due of $8.51

So I figure this must be a listing fee? But no, it's apparently not. I wasn't charged anything for listing fees, according to the invoice.

In fact, it seems to really trump up how much I've got ""*promotional savings!*""

The only thing in this invoice that resembles a fee is under the ""Fees"" section, where I was charged .08 and .10 cents for selling two items (wheat pennies, if it's important).

I'm genuinely confused. I read through the terms&amp;agreements (since I wasn't about to mess with something like this without knowing what I was getting into). I was told I had zero listing fees and no seller fees. So... What am I getting charged $8.51 for?",6,0,2013-12-04,EBAY,0.050636958330869675,0.9089210629463196,0.04044197499752045

I just sold a $900 guitar and the buyer is currently deployed in Afghanistan.

He seems like a straight-forward guy and is very active via email and keeping me in the loop.  Currently, we are just waiting on PayPal to confirm his address and USAA account information.

My question: Has anyone every shipped to a buyer that is deployed via the APO? If so how was your experience? Are there any gotcha's or things I need to be careful about?

Ebay,Should I be worried?,"Relatively new to selling on Ebay. I've sold a couple books, didn't have a problem. This week I sold a 1st generation iPad (side note, if you're thinking about it, now I think would be a great time to sell. I got what I consider a VERY fair price and it sold within two hours).

I took a few steps to combat this and I want to know what people think. My listing said ""no returns"". I took high quality pictures of the device working in the listing. I took a picture of the serial number and placed that in the listing.

Ebay,Need help leaving bad feedback. It's sort of a grey area of 'bad experience' and I've never left anything but a stellar review on there.,"So long story short I bought a jacket on ebay that was advertised as: 

""This is a great Barbour Bedale Coat with Button on hood and Zip in lining. It is brown waxed cotton and is in great condition! The coat says it is a 32, but it fits me fine and I wear a 38r suit. This jacket has an amazing worn in look and is heavy. With the lining it is great for winter. and the hood keeps out the rain.""

This is a pretty expensive jacket (500+ retail) and I definitely paid quite a bit for it.  When it got here, it smells very very very distinctively like mold / mildew.  After a bit of googling I've found that it's somewhat common for old-ish jackets from this brand but it absolutely was not mentioned up front in the ad at all.  I've sold stuff on ebay before and definitely would mention a distinctive smell if anything I sold had it.

Ultimately I don't feel like this was advertised well.  I don't necessarily want to return the jacket, because I can spend 100$ or so to refurbish it and still save money vs. retail.  But I do think I overpaid, and I'm frustrated about it.  

Do I have any recourse?  Is there a way I can get part of my money back?  Or is really all I can do is leave a negative review and go from there?  

Edit, because I was being down voted earlier although the proverbial tide seems to be turning: this is a legit question and I'm trying to figure out, from others' experience, what they've done in the past before I even contact the seller.  It's a win win for me and the seller for me to be informed before I randomly start complaining about this smelly jacket.  I'm not trying to drag his seller rating through the mud or mess with my rating, either, if there's a way to solve it amicably.  


Edit 2:  just to post a resolution, everyone who told me to reach out to the seller first was absolutely correct.  We messaged back and forth, negotiated the discount and he offered me the partial refund I was seeking.  No issues, and I left glowing feedback.  Thanks all!

I am selling three pairs of nice dress shoes, and looking to make the most bang for my buck. These items are top of the line men's shoes, in a desirable size.

I only listed one pair at first, the pair i valued at the least. I posted it as a buy now, $450. After exchanging messages w a buyer, sold it at $400. Great!

Over the weekend, I listed the other two shoes which I consider to be of higher value at a ""buy now"" at 499, or best offer. The offers have all been 300-350. In 24 hours I got about 10 of these offers, so I know the interest is there.

So, with all the interest, should I re-list both shoes as an auction? What starting point? I wont settle for anything less than $400, but would like to sell higher. How can I achieve this?",6,4,2013-12-09,EBAY,0.0194343701004982,0.9014666676521301,0.07909895479679108

Been a lurker around here and a small ebay seller for the past 10 years. Just a situation I've run into that I'm not sure how to handle, and was wondering if anyone had advice or ran into a similar situation before.

I had an auction for a smartphone end at around 9 pm EST yesterday. The winner paid for the item this morning, 9 am EST. Then at 3 pm EST emails me saying: 

""Hi, this is an urgent request, I need to have this by Wednesday evening, can you please expedite the shipment for this so that it arrives by Wednesday evening.""

He's already paid for it, with a confirmed address. I responded at 4 pm EST letting him know that I'd check at the post office (I was already going to go and ship out a few things). Since today's business day is over, his only option is 1 day shipping, and I asked him to send over $25 for 1 day shipping so he can get it by Wednesday (I only had standard ground 2-8 day shipping in the listing), and I'm waiting for a response.

Ebay,Successfull neutral buyer feedback removal,"A few weeks ago I accepted an offer on a vintage-ish 80s lighted beer branded sign. The sign was packed and shipped and that was the last I heard of it until today when I looked at my feedback and saw that the buyer left me a neutral and commented that the light didn't work.

In the original listing I clearly stated, ""it did not light up when I plugged it in"" and ""Because I cannot verify functionality I must insist that the item is sold as-is and no guarantee of functionality is offered"".

It didn't seem fair to me to get a neutral over something the buyer knew when making the purchase (assuming the read the description as they should have), so I wanted to see about getting the blemish removed from my record.

I considered contacting the buyer, but decided against it figuring that, even if I did get a response, the odds of getting the buyer to revise or remove the feedback were slim, so I decided I'd contact eBay support about it and see if something could be done.

Being the first time I've contacted eBay about removing buyer feedback and knowing how the system tends to favor buyers over sellers, I wasn't overly hopeful, but it worked out for me and the feedback was removed within a few minutes.

Ebay,Getting screwed by Chinese seller and eBays preferential treatment of them.,"I ordered a new Lenovo A390 Phone from an eBay seller on November 3rd and made the mistake of not double checking the specifications they listed and instead only checked to see if it was compatible for my area based off of the information they posted.

It turns out that they lied in the posting about the bands that the phone supports claiming that it supported worldwide use and supported north american GSM bands.

I didn't find this out until after I had received the phone and attempted to use it.

I contacted the seller and after days of arguing back and forth and them continually insisting that I am wrong even though I linked them to other sellers advertising the device correctly and Lenovo's own website showing the correct specifications.  They finally offered me a refund of the phone ( roughly 90 dollars Canadian) as long as I shipped the phone back to them with tracking.

I went to my local post office and  got a quote for both non tracked and tracked mail.  The least expensive option for tracked was roughly 45 dollars.  The original shipping on it was free and took roughly a month so I am not getting anything back from that.

I sent the seller the shipping information informing them that I would be happy to send it back after receiving my refund + return shipping.  They refused.
 
After elevating the dispute to eBay to make a final decision they came back to me saying that even though they know the seller has misrepresented the product they will not ask them to cover the return shipping costs and I have a week to ship it back with tracking before it is closed and I get nothing.

So basically what it comes down to is that I am going to be paying 45 dollars for wasting a month of my time.  The seller will not budge and eBay doesn't give a crap.

I will be contacting my credit card provider tomorrow to see if their protection covers this.  Is there anything else you guys could suggest?",6,4,2013-12-12,EBAY,0.0649556890130043,0.9016542434692383,0.03339001536369324

Ebay,Listings removed from my Sold lists so I can't leave feedback/refund etc (VeRO),"I had one active listing, with 3 sold and 1 available.

A company has used VeRO to remove the listing, so the 3 that were sold now don't show up my sales, so I can't do any of the actions like leave feedback/refund/mark as dispatched.

They also went to the trouble of taking down old sales from months ago, so these don't show up in my Sold list either. I think the company was trying to get me enough strikes to be banned, but all that's happened is I can't do anything with the ones I've sold.

I still went to the post office today to send off a plug adapter someone bought, luckily I wrote the address on the package before it was removed. I also want to make it clear that nowhere in the listing did I use the company's name/trademarks, apart from a notice at the top of the description specifically saying this is NOT a 'xxxx' product.

Ebay,Possible scam. Hoping for advice,"I ordered a product from a company on Ebay with a 98% positive reputation and I've run into several problems. Basically, it supposedly shipped on Sunday 12/1, and was supposed to arrive on the following Thursday the fifth. It still hasn't arrived, and the tracking number is bogus. I tried to contact them on Monday, and haven't heard back, and I can take my case further on Friday if there is no response. 

I also looked at their recent reviews, and the past 60+ negative reviews were from people who ordered the exact same product and have the exact same problems. Some of them have gotten the product after a couple weeks, and some still haven't after about a month.

Is this a scam, or a lazy seller, or did they oversell on their product or something? Should I give it some more time, or try to get a refund ASAP? This is a Christmas present so I can't wait too long, bit I'd rather not go through the hassle of trying to get a refund if it's going to arrive soon.

- Insuring it
- Get a tracking number
- Requiring that it's signed for
- Taking detailed pictures of its condition before boxing it up

I have sold things in the past no problem like video games which usually go for $30-$50, nothing of this much value.

- Width 37cm
- Height 32cm
- Length 19cm
- Shipping weight ~15 lbs

Questions:


- What precautions should I take when shipping the item?(to ensure the buyer doesn't try and say they never received it, make sure I don't get screwed, etc).

- With it being so close to Christmas, should I do auction style or just buy it now?  If auction, how many days?

- What shipping method should I use for a package of this size so I don't spend a butt load on shipping costs? (I am listing as free shipping to attract buyers)

I went to the eBay discussion boards to see if anyone else was having/had the same issue in the past, and instead of finding help, I find people raging about the apparent confirmation by eBay of the existence of hidden sales limits and throttling:
[Throttling](http://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/letters/blog.pl?/pl/2013/12/1386721872.html)

Now, my question to you more experienced eBayers is: What the heck is going on? It seems like everyone has a limit, but not everyone can see a limit on their dashboard (I can, but my ebay account itself is 5 years old). But, in addition, are there further throttling mechanisms that keep me from being able to expand my sales regardless of how many new items I add or how much I price competitively? I've been doing this intensively for 3 months now, and each month has returned roughly the same amount of sales, with about 15% variance. This month is on pace for the same.

If eBay really is becoming more and more hostile to individual sellers, what is the best realistic alternative?

I recently sold a game and the buyer messaged me saying it wasn't working, but asked me to issue him a partial refund.  I told him I'd be happy to refund him the full amount plus the cost of shipping if he sent it back.  I assumed that would be the end of it, but he is continually trying to persuade me to give him a partial refund and is ""promising"" me good feedback if I do.  What should I do?

How dare you open a case after 2 days. (sale on 12th case open on 14th) You never said anything in your sale about payment. I wait 7 days before I email the buyer. Why did you not email me.

Ebay,Is it okay to mail my buyer a thank you gift for being understanding in a difficult situation?,"Backstory: I finally sold my old iPhone 4 on Ebay after switching my carrier from Verizon to T-Mobile. Once the auction ended I promptly shipped and mailed the phone after putting back into it's factory settings. The auction ended Wed and the buyer received it Fri.

And then the trouble started. The buyer tried to activate the phone and kept receiving errors. Eventually, Verizon told me my carrier change won't be reflected in their system until Mon (16th). I told the buyer this and they were understanding. 

I think it takes a lot of trust to go into these online electronic deals and I am very grateful the buyer is giving me the benefit of the doubt in all of this. Do you think it would be okay to send them like a $10 gift card with a thank you attached after this all settles?

No, moron, that's not how it works--when I cancel your bid, eBay cancels ALL of your bids, meaning that not only did your $87 bid get removed, so did your $80 bid, so the top bid is back at $79.

Ebay,[Advice] Seller wants to cancel item because the auction didn't make money,"I am throwing this to the reddit community to give me advice.

In short, I won a PS4 bundle.  After shipping, the price is significantly less than MSRP (~$80).  I paid for the auction, and the seller immediately contacted me telling me that he wants to cancel the auction because the PS4 is damaged and he doesn't want to ship it out.

According to the auction, the items are NIB.  The photos show no damage to the items.  According to the seller's history, he has sold a few PS4 bundles before and they went for significantly higher than MSRP.  

Here is the dilemma:  

* Should I go ahead and cancel the auction, putting me out of a bargain, and allow the seller to relist the items?


* Should I choose not to cancel the auction and risk getting defective items as the seller may ""accidentally"" drop or damage the items?

Ebay,Being threatened by a seller.,"So I sent a message to a seller who was selling a bobblehead for too much money. I offered him an amount of money to sell it to me and he accepted. He changed the amount and I pressed buy it now and paid. He had 0 feedback.

Then he sent a message refusing to send the item because paypal held his funds until after it was confirmed to be delivered etc etc. I was very patient and explained that he needed to send the item and finally he did after he spoke to paypal and eBay and waited about an extra week.

So then I get the item and it wasn't in great shape but the box had a massive grease stain on it and it had grown mold. I am a collector and this is unacceptable for my collection. He listed the item as brand new. So then I asked for a return and a refund. He refused and said he would only refund the amount minus his original shipping cost because he didn't want to have to be out that money. 

So another fight ensued and he finally just refunded my money. Ebay never said I had to send the item back, but I was going to do it anyways. But then I didn't have his address. I sent a message asking for it and he never replied. Then I got two messages from him:

""I do not understand why you have not returned my item, i refunded your money and you said you were gonna return my item. i have contacted ebay and made them aware that you scammed me out of my item and all I want is it returned like you said you would. 
you really should not do business like this especially when sellers have your address as I do. You never who you are dealing with or what they may be capable of doing, especially if you are robbing people.

Ebay,Can I sell outside of eBay and removing listing (so long as eBay is not involved with the sale in any way)?,"I understand the condensed version of my question may be a bit unclear.  Basically, consider the scenario where I have a brick-and-mortar consignment store.  By eBay's terms of use, is it acceptable for me to sell an item to Joe Schmoe in town, and immediately remove the listing (""Item no longer available"")?  I understand this would be fine a couple of times, but on a large scale would there be any grounds for revoking my ability to list items?

I ask only in regards to fixed-price items to avoid the gray area of when it is acceptable to end an auction-style listing.

As a follow-up, how does this policy hold up against eCommerce stores?  If I can sell the item in my own store before someone buys it on eBay, I will theoretically be 2-4% ahead.

EDIT: I am aware that listing fees will be applied in any case, simply concerned about the final value fees for the web store or the removal of a large number of items in a brick-and-mortar consignment operation.",5,3,2013-12-18,EBAY,0.059292230755090714,0.919855535030365,0.02085224911570549

Ebay,Deceived by a seller,"Hello Reddit,
 
I have a issue that I was wondering if I could have some assistance with.
I purchased an item in mid-October. I received the item, didn’t like and returned within the allowed time.  The seller was fine with this and opened a resolution enter case that allow for the canceling of the transaction. We both agreed and the transaction was canceled (October 29th). I have read the terms but nowhere did it say to not agree until you received your refund. Also it stated that if I did not agree the seller would be able to do this anyway without my consent/
 
A refund was supposed to be granted and it is now mid-December and I still have not received a refund. I emailed the seller in November and they stated that it should have been processed and they will check into it. I have since then sent numerous messages with no response and still have no refund.

My dad worked for a local theater in the Detroit area from around 79-91.  He would make it a habit of always bringing home the extra promotional materials and over 4 different moves he's ended up with 5 boxes of rolled up concert posters.  

The range is everything, he's got a 79 Romantics real old looking poster all the way to a shipped tube with 20 Badmotofinger Soundgarden posters from 91.

We've pulled some random ones and posted a few to check out on ebay, selling 5 so far randomly for $8-$24.  Exception being a Return to Oz teaser poster with the original Disney Studios package that went for $120.


My dad is taking a trip overseas for the first time and I'm trying to help him raise some extra funds.  Whats the best way to sell hundreds and hundreds of posters going forward.  I know that I have not done a good job with not enough good pictures and what categories do I pick, etc.

Should I set up an ebay store or something?  Or just keep posting auction format a few more each week ....

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Ebay,What shipping methods and pricing are you using?,"I'm just curious what shipping methods sellers are using and how they price them for the customer.

I am a small, part-time seller working from home selling collectible toys and flipping various vintage, pop culture items, collectibles, video game systems, Android phones, and some other odds and ends.

I am shipping via USPS only using First Class for anything 13 oz or less and Parcel Select or Priority Mail (regular) for everything else to the continental US and sometimes Canada. I haven't done anything with Priority Mail Flat Rate or Regional yet, should I be looking into these? I'm still making regular trips to the post office, but have started scheduling pickups when there are a lot or it isn't convenient. This is a free service, but requires that at least once of your packages are Priority Mail of some kind.

UPS and FedEx are not convenient to my location.

I usually offer free shipping on the First Class stuff and build the cost into my BIN price. For the Parcel Select and Priority I use calculated retail shipping cost +1 to $5 handing depending on the effort and supplies required. I have been printing my own postage at the Commercial Base pricing and will start getting the Commercial Plus pricing (discounted Priority) from the Power Seller or Top Rated program (I don't remember which gives it).

Sometimes I'll offer free shipping on a larger item, but only if I'm trying to get it sold off or something has a particularly good profit margin on it and I'd like to collect it sooner than later.

Ebay,"Guy made a low offer for an item, I rejected, now he's bought the item and sent a message telling me he's not going to pay.","Alright so I had a lengthy exchange with this guy, he made a low offer for one of my items, I counter offered, he sent me a message with another low offer and requesting free shipping.

I told him sorry but no and left it at that, well then he starts sending a bunch of messages like ""lol"", ""y u try to sell for that much"" &amp; ""whats so special about this item u cant sell to me for this""

At this point I got annoyed and replied telling him politely that I was not looking to just give the item away and then I let my irritation get the better of me and at the end added that he was acting like a child and I did not wish to do business with him (I understand this was foolish of me).

He purchased the item and his immediate response was

""Yeah and tell your mom I said she's a b**** let's see how long it takes me to pay a**hole""

Ebay,"Way too many non-paying ""buyers"" lately on eBay.",This is our third auction in a week with a winning bidder who refused to pay for their item.

Ebay,"Top rated power seller with 100% positive feedback and have received 4 separate ebay violations in past 3 weeks, sales down about 50-75%.","We've been a member for 8 years on ebay, and have been full time for 2. We have 100% positive feedback, always ship next day, and have excellent customer feedback. We always follow through on our transactions, and contact/refund the customer immediately on the rare occasion that we screwed up. We've never had an unresolved case or problem with a customer. We've also never had a problem with ebay and visa versa. However, the past couple weeks we've received 4 separate violations from ebay, 2 I didn't even know about until I called to ask why sales had dropped so dramatically during the holiday shopping season. It almost seems like we've been targeted somehow, and I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced anything similar.

Violations

1. Facebook link in listings: About a year ago we called ebay about putting our facebook link in our listings. We list beach photos and whatnot, along with links back to our ebay page and items. Ebay said that it wasn't a problem and to go ahead. They said there's a 2 click rule that you can't link to anything where items are for sale elsewhere within 1 click. Last week, after almost a year of having the link in all our listings with ebay approval, they sent a violation. I called ebay, and they again confirmed that it was not a problem after looking at our facebook page. But, it STILL shows on our account as a violation.

2. Mentioning Retail Store: about 6 months ago, we opened a retail store, and called ebay, asking if it would be ok to put the text ""If you're in the Palm Beach area, stop by and visit us in person at our retail store"". They said it would be fine, so we added it to all our listings. Then last week, we received a violation for it, after 6 months of use. When I called, and pointed out that Best Buy has a banner on their home page that specifies to pic items up at there retail store, they said we simply needed to change the wording from ""Visit us at"" to ""Pick your item up at"". So we made the change. Again, this is something that ebay ok'd before we added it, but the violation still shows on our account.

3. Multiple ebay accounts: When I called about the low sales and other violations, the rep said that we had another violation that wwas unresolved for having 2 accounts open, even though ebay is the one that suggested opening a second account and walked us through all the steps to do it properly (we had 2 accounts for 2 totally different types of merchandise and wanted to keep the look and feel different). They sent me to the trust and safety department, that said they couldn't find the violation, and there's nothing he could do. I also showed the rep to the link the their own policy that says: ""There are many reasons why users would choose to have more than one eBay account."" and ""Whether you have one account or more, eBay expects users to manage each of their accounts effectively in order to meet the highest buyer and seller standards.""

4. Excessive cancelled transactions: We had about 7 cancelled transactions in November, all of which were from customers who purchased an item, and then changed their mind. We sold around 500 items that month. The representative actually told me that I need to learn how to follow through on the items we sell, and that we shouldn't list an item if we don't intent to sell it. Wow.

UPDATE: Below is the latest (12/25/13)...

1. Facebook link in listings. Although ebay reassured me that this was ok to leave in, after some others advice and weighing the risks, I decided to remove the links from all of my almost 700 listings. I tried using the ""find and replace"" feature in the bulk editor, but because it was html it wouldn't work properly. I then tried using bulk edit, using the ""change listings individually"" option, but it kept giving a system error. Ebay confirmed problem. So, I had to click on each listing separately and make the edits. It took 14 hours of solid work, finishing at about 9 pm on Christmas eve. I figured the little bit of advantage I got from having the link in there was far outweighed by the chance of having my account automatically shut down by a bot that can't read the notes and starving to death...

2. Retail Store: Same as above. I removed any mention of even picking the items up in store, even though Best Buy says the same thing on ebays home page.

3. Multiple ebay accounts: Again since the reward isn't worth the hassle, I decided to just close the second account. I stopped using the 2nd account last month anyway, and actually tried to close it then. But ebay said we had a final invoice we had to pay before we could close it. After the invoice came in and got paid, I just sort of forgot about closing it. Yesterday I tried to close it again, but now it says I have a credit balance, and ebay won't allow us to close the account without first transferring the balance to paypal, which they say takes 2-3 days. Hopefully we don't get shut down for having 2 accounts before they allow us to close it.. NEW UPDATE: I logged into my duplicate account and it showed that my balance was $0. So I tried to close it, and it said I can't since I've made a payment recently. It said to wait 30 days and try again. This is retarded. I'm getting penalized for having 2 accounts open, but I'm not allowed to close one. Also, when I clicked ""close account"", it brought up a message saying ""Are you sure you want to close your account? There are many advantages for members to have more than one account."" wtf?

4. Excessive cancelled transactions: With dealing with the other issues, I have not yet had a chance to dig more into this one. I plan on calling them tomorrow to discuss.",22,19,2013-12-23,EBAY,0.1658458262681961,0.7971973419189453,0.03695684392005205

Ebay,Questions regarding shipping overseas,"Hello all, first time posting here, and I have a question about shipping overseas. So today an auction I had up for some boots ended, and two people bidded in the last 30-5 seconds.

I was a bit disappointed, but the person has over 2k + ratings, so I don't think it's a problem. What should I do to protect myself when shipping the package? I believe USPS Priority Mail includes $50-100 insurance, which is actually more than what I paid for the item, but what else should I do to ensure a smooth process, protecting myself from shipping overseas? 

Am I able to tell the buyer that I am charging them for the insurance prices? 

Should I make the item""sign for delivery?"" 

Lastly, since this package will be going overseas, will it be safer using a company like fed ex or ups?

Ebay,"Sold an iPhone 4 on eBay, buyer has opened a case against me","Hello there.

I put a faulty iPhone 4 up for sale on eBay on 14th December. He purchased the phone using Buy it Now and payed straight away. I posted the phone on the next working day (16th) using recorded delivery and provided him with a tracking number. Two days later he has signed for the item and all is well.

Well today I log onto eBay and see that he has opened a case against me. He states that the item is broken or defective because it is bricked. Despite listing the item as 'for spares or repair' and stating several times that it was faulty: 

* Title: Apple iPhone 4 - Black - 16GB - Faulty

* Item Condition: For parts or not working

* Description x3 - You are bidding on a faulty black iPhone 4. 

* Faulty (locked to iCloud screen, don't know how to fix this)

* Just to reiterate, this phone is faulty and is being sold as ""For parts or not working.

So after all of this, the buyer is claiming it's broken and now my Paypal account is in negative balance. I have offered to refund the money (£74.10) if he returns the phone as I don't want eBay to rule in his favour and he keeps the phone and the money.

I always try to bring the weight down as much as possible and package it correctly where it doesn't break.

I currently have it up for the third time and have noticed a pattern. There seems to be a bidding war going on between two users. One is the same user every time, who keeps bidding to raise the price but never wins. The second user has been different in each auction and is an established eBay user with good feedback... but who hasn't had any feedback in over a year.

Ebay,How do I get my money back?,"I purchased a vehicle on Ebay recently and am affraid I have been scammed out of $1,000. 

The auction had a stipulation that a Non Refundable Down Payment be made within 24 hours of the close. I confirmed the email address of the seller and used Google Wallet to send him the $1,000. That was Sunday around 5pm and I haven't heard from the seller since. I've sent him Ebay messages, emails, text messages etc all with no response. Now I see he has two recent negative feedback items on his ebay account saying he is a scammer and never gave the vehicle over. 

At this point I think I can safely get out of the transaction on ebay but I was wondering how I can go about getting my $1000 back via Google Wallet. 

I know some information about the guy but i'm not sure what is actual and what is not. 

I know his name (as well as several aliases he uses), bank account number, phone number, and email address, I also have an address he gave me letting me know where to van is, but it looks like an empty lot on google maps. I'm 3 or so hours driving away from him so it is hard for me to go there in person.  

I called Google Wallet and they say he has already claimed the funds so I can't cancel the transaction.

1. Do you think USPS lost my package?
2. Can I get eBay to remove this negative feedback when it wasn't my fault?

Ebay,I have questions for more experienced sellers about my problems with shipping to a buyer,"I sold an Xbox 360 hard drive to someone about a month ago and I shipped it within 24 hours of receiving my payment but then it never reached the buyer. It  eventually was returned to me, the package was beat to hell but the hard drive appears to be in the same shape as when I sent it. 

My first thought was maybe the guy tried to scam me and that he switched the drive but it still has the same markings and serial number, the package was worn but it didn't look like it was ever opened. It also had a delivery failed return to sender sticker on it from USPS too.

Originally I was going to refund the seller after checking that it still works but now he's asking for a reshipping of the hard drive. 

My question for anyone who is a more experienced seller is: does anyone recommend I just refund him and wash my hands of it after I check if it works?

If what I'm thinking is correct, then maybe this (somewhat risky) tactic will work. Let's say something used gets put up for auction at $100, but the most I'm actually will to pay is $200, and the item itself sells brand new for $300. Now, given common sense, no one's going to pay over the brand new price, right? And certainly now way over the new price either. So, if I bid something ridiculous like $1000, no one will be able to outbid that, so no matter what I should win the auction at the starting price of $100.

Ebay,Could be walking into a scam. Need advice.,"Hello, 

I've recently just sold an item on eBay (a GameBoy Advance). The buyer (we'll call him BuyerA) has paid and I've packaged the item ready to be sent off.

Then, I was messaged by another seller (we'll call him SellerA) indicating that he was scammed by BuyerA in some way.

[Link to SellerA's issue with BuyerA](http://community.ebay.com/t5/Seller-Central/Buyer-asks-for-refund-sends-back-an-item-with-a-different-serial/td-p/17602981)

Apparently, SellerA sold an as-is GBA SP (for parts) to BuyerA. However, BuyerA complained that none of parts were functioning at all. SellerA then grants a return (at the advice of the eBay forum). However, BuyerA sends SellerA a GBA unit that was not the same as what SellerA has sold to him. After some difficult dealing with eBay support, SellerA eventually gets his money back.

Some notes to consider about my item:

* The buyer has already paid
* The postage label has been printed, but the package has **NOT** been shipped yet.

My question is:

Since I'm dealing with the same buyer who might try to pull the same thing on me, what is my course of action right now?

Ebay,"So I recently sold my first item on ebay, double checked to ensure the item was functioning perfectly prior to shipping and packaged the item in not one, but two nested boxes to ensure a safe delivery. Now, the buyer has filed a dispute.","I recently sold a guitar effects pedal on ebay that I've had for a few years now. It's one of my favorite pieces of gear I've ever owned, but I've been short on money and don't play guitar much anymore, so I decided to put it up for sale.

Prior to shipping, I tested it out for about half an hour, then placed it in its box, which I then brought to the post office and placed in another box to ensure its safety in transit. I did not include an external power supply or batteries.

Tonight, I received a message through ebay in which the buyer filed a dispute, claiming the item was not as described and expecting a full refund. According to the buyer, the item does not turn on with batteries or a power supply.

I'm not sure what to do. There's virtually no way the item could have been damaged while shipping and I know for a fact the item worked perfectly prior to shipping. The only thing I can think of that could damage the item would be using an external power source of the wrong voltage, which can potentially short out a pedal.

Ebay,Cancelling transactions and having them denied.,"Hi

Sorry if this is covered somewhere and I missed it.

I had a buyer purchase a game from me prior to Christmas.  I was ready to ship the item.  They then messaged me asking for me to send to a non-confirmed address.  I sent a message in response saying I was not comfortable sending to this address (they have 0 feedback, registered a month ago).  I asked if we could send to the confirmed address of if they had any other confirmed addresses to do a refund and purchase again with the correct address.

I got no response, so I sent another message basically saying the same thing.   Again no response.   So today I refunded their money and filled a case with ebay to cancel the item.

Low and behold they deny it and say the same thing on the case, please send to 123...whatever in broken English.  

So I'm stuck with the final fees. Can I just walk away from this now?  Or do I have to have the buyer repay me and send?",12,2,2013-12-28,EBAY,0.05855148658156395,0.8988412618637085,0.04260721057653427
Ebay,Do I need to have money in my Paypal account to pay off my eBay invoice?,"I sold my first item 3 weeks ago and withdrew the funds in my Paypal to my checking account. Around a week or so ago I received an eBay invoice to pay $4.00. 

Problem is... I just realized the amount will be deducted from my Paypal around the 30th and it's currently empty.

I DO, however, have my debit card attached to Paypal. Will they deduct the invoice amount through my card if it's attached to Paypal?

I doubt I will have enough days to transfer back $4.00 to Paypal.....",0,1,2013-12-28,EBAY,0.04340864345431328,0.9172658324241638,0.039325516670942307
Ebay,Seeking advise from sellers - buyer scamming me,"I've been on ebay for a few years now, but only really sell about a dozen things a year.  I'm seeking advise on what to do, heres my problem.

I sold a camera before Christmas.  It came in the original box, battery charge, battery, manuals/paperwork, etc...  It was in very good condition since we only used it for birthday parties and such.

Anyhow, sold it after Thanksgiving.  It arrived 4 days later to the buyer.  Week before Christmas buyer opens a Significantly not as described case.  They said the camera is in poor condition, alot of scratches and damage.

I had a 30 day return on the camera so I told the buyer to return it and I would refund them once they returned it.

Wednesday the 26th of December, the package came returned.  I opened it up, ready to issue a refund, I notice right away, the battery, charger, mini remote, have all been replaced with some others from a totally different camera, not even a matching camera.  Charger is from a Panasonic, battery is a Canon and remote is also a Canon.  Manual is included but missing the cover and has alot of bends and handwritting.  And finally the camera appears to have been disassembled, the screw heads are worns.  Serial # on the camera matches the one sold, but the other pieces, cover etc... have alot of scratches and heavy wear, definately not the one I sold.

So I emailed the buyer and told them everything.  I even said the items dont match the ones I have pictured in the auction.  They proceeded to tell me thats what they received, they didnt even open the rest up only removed the camera.  They also said they ""dont care what the pictures in the auction show, this is what they received"".

They're also accusing me of trying to scam them.  If I dont return their money they will contact the police and their attorney.  Meanwhile Im stuck with a different camera, and none of the original pieces.

I called ebay and the Indian call center is of NO help.

So I'm seeking advise from some more experienced sellers.  What is my next move, what should I do?",4,1,2013-12-28,EBAY,0.10875555127859116,0.8637680411338806,0.027476394549012184

Ebay,Paypal's Multi-Order Shipping crashes on me....does it not want my money?,"So I have two items that need postage: something that needs to go Media Mail and something that needs to go First Class Parcel. It's not eBay auction items, just personal stuff. The USPS.com website only does Priority &amp; Exp.....I mean ""Priority Express."" The APC at the nearest Post Office doesn't do Media Mail. And for some odd reason, the clerks at the post offices near me are getting extremely pissed over anyone shipping Media Mail and have been angrily opening up packages to inspect them. I want to avoid them as much as possible (unless someone can tell me if VHS tapes don't qualify for Media nowadays).

Aside from the rants about how the USPS is bleeding money while blowing profit opportunity, I figured Paypal's shipping option would be my salvation, as i've done it in the past with no trouble that isn't an eBay auction. 

Nope, all it does is purchase the postage/grabbing tracking numbers.....and then says it cannot do it after I imputed all the info. It never takes money out of my account, nor there is a record of it even attempting to do it.

I recently sold my iPad on eBay and the iPad appears to be broken now.

It's an iPad 2 32gb if anyone is interested.

Ebay,Stuck with selling limits forever,"So after having my eBay account since 2010 and selling a few items every once in a while I decided to start selling more. I reached my 10 items/$100 per month limit and gave eBay a call to extend my limit. They said they needed to verify my identity by asking me questions from a public database. They asked me about family members, places I've lived, and cars I own but I have no idea where they are getting that information from. They said those questions are related to me 100% from my name, address, and date of birth. They wanted to close down my account but decided to let me stay where I am. So now I'm stuck at this limit forever when I was really excited to start making money on eBay.

I'm 21 years old, I have nothing to my name but my bank account, SSN, and ID so i don't know where they got all that false information about me from.",8,1,2013-12-29,EBAY,0.12582933902740479,0.8513223528862,0.022848309949040413

Ebay,"Value of the purchased items changed while PayPal transaction was made, seller thinks he can give me fewer of said items, is it legal?","So the thing is I bought virtual items, what specific doesn't matter. Let's just say I bought 100 pieces of said virtual item through his shop which was at that time 10€, now the rate of items per Euro has changed in the time PayPal took to transfer the money (which was about 12 days...). Does he have the right to decrease the amount of items he sends me to let's say 90?

I mean, I paid 10€ for 100 items and it shouldn't matter how the rate is, because that's the price I paid for when pressing the Buy Now button.
