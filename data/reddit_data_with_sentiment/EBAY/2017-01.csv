Ebay,Seller asked for more money months after item refunded,"So I awoke to a very odd email from Paypal telling me a seller was asking for more money for an item I never received from months ago that was refunded.

The story goes I bought two 45rpm records from this seller back in September. He was from the UK so I figured it would take awhile to get to the US as this wasn't my first import. Well flash forward a month and the items never came and it was significant amount of time over the expected arrival date (maybe a week, I don't remember exactly). So I get a refund on both records. 

Flash forward to today, and the items still never arrived and I get two emails from Paypal telling me this seller is asking for repayment. I denied almost immediately. I have no idea why, after all this time, the seller is asking for money. He never provided tracking and dodged any question asking for one.

Ebay,Insane number of message-based offers?,"So, I took a hiatus from eBay for about 6 months. Came back last week to cash in on ""after x-mas"" sales. Previously, I'd get the occasional ""Will you take $X?"" It'd be one every 3-6 months. 

Ever since I've been back, I've been inundated with requests for lower prices. It seems to be at least one per day. Some offers have been rational, others of which have been just crazy low, like 30% off. It seems like the 'respond with offer' function has become super abused by buyers. 

Note, my previous policy was always to block buyers that asked to negotiate, because they'd buy the item, and then invariably open a case to negotiate the price post-purchase. This seems less necessary now. 

So, here's my questions. Is this happening to everyone else? Do you feel the need to respond to each offer, even if its like 30% or more off the asking price?

Ebay,"Advice For Selling Electronics and Accepting Returns Please, Thanks!","Hi there! I need some advice please. 

I'm thinking of selling the hardware from my old computer separately. They still all function properly, but since I've had a bad experience last year selling electronics where a buyer returned an item to me at my own expense (I didn't allow returns... but you know how Ebay is when it comes to customers) because he liked the other item he bought from another place better, I want to be more careful this time around.

It seems that the minimum default amount of days given by Ebay to buyers to let them return items are 14 days right? I am fine with that when it comes to these electronics, I can let buyers try out the items for 2 weeks before not allowing returns anymore. What I want to happen though is if they choose to return it, they'll be the ones to pay the shipping and not me. 

I've also seen some shops on Ebay where they state that they allow returns, BUT they only give out partial refund and they keep a restocking fee of a certain percentage. Is the ""restocking fee"" something I can set on Ebay when I allow returns or is this just some kind of self-imposed policy by the store that will hold no ground when it comes to Ebay and how they side with customers majority fo the time?

I guess the other way to be safe when selling electronics is to record the serial numbers of the items I'm gonna sell so that I won't be a victim of item switch scams.

So in summary, I just want to allow returns within 14 days and I want the buyer to pay for the return shipping fee, and maybe have a small ""restocking fee"" for the trouble. Can someone who has experience setting up a similar sale please tell me how the process works and if it's as easy as setting up normal ""no return"" sales or if it's more complicated than that?

Thanks again in advance and have a good day!",5,5,2017-01-02,EBAY,0.040155958384275436,0.9239572882652283,0.035886794328689575

Ebay,Buyer is asking for item to be shipped to different address,"Hi all,
I sold an iPad and the buyer asked me to send it to a different address. I'm concerned about not being protected so I informed him that I'd have to cancel and refund, and he would have to rebuy since as far as I'm aware, I have to ship to the address eBay gives me in order to be protected. He said he updated it in both of his accounts, so I sent a cancel request to the buyer and went to refund him.
Turns out he sent me an eCheck... which I can't cancel nor refund... woo.
eBay rep. told me to wait it out and refund him and the case will close out, though the buyer is arguing with me that he spoke with an ebay rep who told him that asking me to ship it to ""an updated address"" is fine and mentioned something about them sending me a memo or whatever. Either way said address isn't updated in the order nor is it updated on the PayPal Payment so I'm leery even if I send it with signature confirmation as I planned.

I simply replied with the fact that I still can't ship it right away because of the eCheck processing time, and attached a snip of PayPal's email (no sensitive data contained). I'm also extremely concerned that the address he used to pay me with is unverified and the email I got from PayPal tells me that I'm not protected as a seller. The buyer claims he ""Paid with eBay Gift Cards and PayPal"" but all I have sitting in my account is a PayPal payment that I can't do anything with.

I've sold a decent bit on eBay but I have a lot of red lights and alarms going off in my head right now, so I'm extremely leery, though also worried about getting dinged with a negative.

Buyer has 3 feedback, but I can't see any actual reviews on his page for some reason (older than a year?)

Ebay,Seller lies about item location + perhaps about postal company (Italian speakers help),"Hello.

Earlier today I opened a thread about wanting to migrate to Amazon due to innacurate shipping times estimated by eBay. This was done in a hissy fit due to frustration but I really need the item which I am waiting for (and which is late).
Upon further investigation, I found out that the seller is, in fact, located in China and not in the UK. I figure this is to get much better estimated shipping times. Can I report this to eBay? I paid more to order from him specifically, because it said the item was supposedly located in the UK and would arrive faster.

Also, he put Spedizione internazionale standard as the shipping company, which adds to the confusion further because it is an Italian company. Perhaps this is so one could check the tracking number in English.

I have just found out that you can check the tracking number on pretty much any item (I previously thought you had to pay for tracking) so I tried to do it, but the site was in Italian so I couldn't understand SHIT. Even after translating the site.

I just contacted the seller but instead of having to wait another year for him to reply and probably not understand the message because he speaks shitty English, can an Italian speaker check the item location for me if I give the tracking number?

Ebay,Laugh with me. Buyer is angry because they found my item cheaper on local Facebook group.,"I am (almost) speechless. Buyer bought and paid for item and received it within 48 hours. Now they are angry because someone put the same item up for sale on a local Facebook group and buyer now wants me to refund the difference so my item costs the same as that.

Idiot buyer doesn't seem to understand one reason mine was more expensive (but still cheapest on eBay) is because it was shipped right to his door. Also when did local Facebook groups become the measure of pricing? I cannot get through to this person at all. It's so ridiculous I'm actually in stitches!

I'm not worried about any negs as their messages clearly show feedback extortion. 'Refund the difference or il leave negative feedback for you' Also, they have already left positive feedback before they went onto Facebook.

when I got the product and tried to put my tablet in it, it wouldn't fit, my tablet was 8.8"". I had seen videos and other people online say that their Nvidia shield tablet (the same one I have) fit the 8"" model just right. 

I thought there must have been some sort of revision and they had changed the sizes at some point. I figured that it would be too costly for me to send it back since I live in rural Canada, so instead I decided to modify the case to make my tablet fit. The part that holds the tablet is only a bit of plastic so it wasn't very hard with a Dremel tool and some glue.

So the seller sent me the wrong model. it was advertised on the page as the 8"" model but they sent me the smaller and cheaper 7"" model

Ebay,Unauthorized Charge Case - Best Course of Next Action?,"Hello all,

Wanted to ask here if anyone has a recommendation for what I should do next in a Paypal chargeback case that a buyer has decided to open.  Here are the details:

- Late November - Buyer with 1 feedback purchases ~$350 worth of products from me.  I ship it off to the Paypal supplied address and it gets delivered no problem 3 days later.
- January 6, 2017 - Buyer initiates a credit card chargeback under the reasoning of ""Unauthorized payment"" in the means of a credit card chargeback.
- January 7, 2017 - I give Paypal a bunch of files proving a number of things: I shipped the package to the Paypal supplied address, the shipping menu stated it was eligible for seller protection, the USPS tracking # showing that the package has been delivered, AND the publicly available 2016 Property Tax information showing that the buyer's name is the person who paid the property tax for the address I shipped to.

As it is past 1 AM, I doubt Paypal is going to answer a phone call now but I plan to call them first thing tomorrow morning.

Other than this, is there anything that I should be doing to have this case resolved in my favor?  Anyone have any experience with this sort of thing?

It is very blatantly obvious that the buyer is committing fraud and a scam, but I just want to make sure all of my bases are covered.  Thanks in advance.

**TL;DR: Buyer initiates a chargeback on ~$350 purchase, I provide proof of delivery and proof the buyer lives at the address I shipped to, what do you think I should do next other than call Paypal, which is my next step.**",6,3,2017-01-07,EBAY,0.03988364711403847,0.9341065287590027,0.026009835302829742

Ebay,What can I do about this guy who is actively trying to screw with me?,"Started about two weeks ago. Tried to sell a ps3 console in an auction. It's an older model, so a littler rarer than most. Some guy says he lives in same state and wants to meet up. I say no and he starts jacking up my auction prices and then he decides to follow my ebay page. I cancel his bids and block him. Then another account was made same day and does the same thing, so I just end the auction temporarily. 

Thought I'd try my luck and relist but for only 3 days. Only a couple hours after relisting, it's sold to a brand new account created within the hour of the sale. I'm fairly certain it's the same guy trying to scam me - I only have two followers and the other is legitimate. Because I can't remove followers, this guy can follow me forever and harass me without any repercussions. What can I do about this?

I knew the most recent sale was a con for several reasons:
1. It was brand new account   
2. The dude requested an invoice and still hasn't paid  
3. He sent me a message saying, ""Hope to do a nice business with you."" (cringe)  
4. He submitted a user info request, which is what I assume they use to get your email or phone number. The number listed is actually my old #, so I haven't gotten any text messages  
5. The email is @clovermail.net. I think this is one you can use fake info to get a new email  
6. His address actually leads to a dentist's office and there are no people who work there under his name. I checked  
7. His number is a textnow number. Textnow is an app that lets you generate numbers on your existing phone.   
8. The buyer marked as payment received, but there is no payment received.   

As I'm fairly certain this is all from the same user, what can I do? Can I go ahead and cancel the transaction stating ""buyer chose to cancel"" so I can get the ffv back? If not, how do I go about canceling the transaction and protecting myself from this buyer.

Ebay,Using shipping services outside of eBay instead of paying for eBay shipping labels via Paypal so I can utilize my credit card?,"When you use eBay shipping labels it pays for them through Paypal. It's easy and quick. However, I project nearly $15,000 will go to shipping this year and I'd rather get credit card points for them then absolutely nothing from Paypal. Thats 45,000 pts for me at a minimum which is anywhere from $675-$1,620 in value ( Aka a vacation)

The only way I've seen and used eBays system to circumvent Paypal Balance shipping purchases was to have a Balance of $0 so Paypal pulls from my backup funding source. However, this is entirely inconvenient as I like to keep some funds in Paypal at all times to cover returns and emergency ATM cash withdrawals.

Now I've always been pissed eBay doesnt offer direct CC funding for shipping but this is my second biggest year and I can't ignore losing those points.

I could have bought it for a much lower prize. I wanted to give you a negative feedback for that issue but it is on you and karma will follow for sure.

I responded and told him to open a return case and I will send a return label and once I get the item back I will refund 100%. This also happened a few weeks ago with another item where the customer wasn't happy and I sent the same response. Well as usual I never hear back and a case is never opened on the item.

Ebay,"Incoming Borrowing Buyer Issue, advice?","Hi all,

I sold a very rare 19th century Irish lace wrap to a buyer. It was a couple of hundred dollars. Buyer was thrilled. Ok fine. A week later she contacts me and says she is ""doing some research on the item to decide if she is going to keep it"". 

When I asked her why she replied:"" she ""wanted to confirm the age of the item because she is not wealthy and spending a couple of hundred is a lot of money.  It is beautiful but may not fit her collection and has to be choosy""

First of all I don't dispute her checking, that's her right, but it sounds like a BS excuse to borrow and return. I checked her buying history on Onkud and let's just say it looks like she is party planning a themed party and wants this to dress up in. The other baubles and party decor match a concept, but the wrap is far above what she is paying for other things.  Quickly googled her and this further fits my assumption.

I sell antiques all the time and feel 100% sure the item is authentic, so I am also unconcerned.

I basically cut and pasted what she said. 

Does this sound like a Buyer's Remorse return in the making? Assuming nothing else would I win a claim. It also sounds like now she thinks she overpaid for it. 

Also how does one win an authenticity claim? Do I hire an expert or can I lay out my background as a Textiles expert and use that?

Ebay,My inventory was stolen,"**The Ebay Situation**

On the side I was building a gift card business off of Ebay. Basically, a partner &amp; I would loiter around town near Coinstar Gift card Machines and when the machine would give someone a terrible offer we'd offer them $3-5 more on the spot. Then we'd throw them up on eBay and split the profits.

Unfortunately, my partner turned out to be completely untrustworthy and while I was overseas with my family they took all the cash + inventory and ran, leaving me with an eBay store, with 23 orders for $500 gift cards to be fufilled, no money to pay it up.

Seller did not respond (none of them respond. Figures) and 2 days later the listing vanished. Luckly i got my money back and the ebay message that the seller account was compromised bla bla crap.

So I message the seller and tell them that the system has scratches on the screen and the back of the console, he tells me that they might be smudges and to use a cleaning wipe or that shipping might have caused it, again I send him a message tell him that they are definitely not a smudge and that it looks like the scratches were already there and that the system looks nothing like the one in the photos. I then Google Crystal Blue 2ds and see that the photos he used on his listing are definitely the same ones I see on Google.

When you sent many questions about the product, I always was true and very fast to respond to make sure potential buyers had the best possible idea of what they were bidding on.

I've sold a brand new and sealed item, upon receipt the buyer has said that the item does not have a hinge on the container. 

Yes, the container. So this is a tool which can be housed in a plastic box and the box does not have a hinge. 

I've just reiterated that it is a sealed item and that the item does not come with a hinge. As I have no reason to believe the item is faulty. 

Didn't hear anything more about it until I get an ebay message ""reminder"" that the case is still open. I was told of any case.

The listing said No Returns. 

I replied to the ebay reminder that a case was open stating that I want ebay to intervene as I disagree with the buyers statement. And I typed a short message stating that the item was sealed and in no way defective. 

What is likely to happen from here?

My guess is that the buyer realised they can buy the item cheaper elsewhere.

Ebay,"Got scammed pretty badly, and eBay sided with the scammer","Hi everyone. I'm a long-time lurker on Reddit but never had an actual account before. This is a pretty crazy story, I was wondering if anybody had a similar experience. 

I ordered an iPad (pro 9.7 inch 128 GB. Won a bid on it for $495) off of eBay on December 26th from a seller with no feedback. He gave me a tracking number and it said it was delivered to my town. I never got the package, so I called USPS and they confirmed that the tracking number was linked to a different address in my town. I went down to my post office and they told me where the package was sent. It was a local business in my town and I drove down there and they had the package. The package was shipped from Amazon and it was a $3 SIM card. I open up a claim with eBay stating this information and they told me I had to wait until Friday before they could step in. On friday I asked them to step in and they reviewed and then declined my claim stating that it was delivered. I called customer service and they told me that they have documentation that it was delivered to my address but they do not; just a tracking number that showed it was delivered to my town (the customer service rep from India kept saying that they found ""shocking"" evidence it was delivered lol). I contacted Amazon and their investigative team is looking at the person that ordered the item to scam me with's history. I am pissed and out $500. I filed a dispute with PayPal and they said that it'll take ten days until I get my money back provided the seller doesn't reply back to them, which I suspect he won't. 
Super frustrating, only bad experience on eBay I've ever had. Customer support and their ""investigation team"" was a terrible experience for me.

Update: Paypal emailed me asking to return the item to get a refund. The address they gave me to return it to is 1880 braselton hwy, lawrenceville, GA 30043. This is a retail plaza, so if I sent the item to this address, it would end up getting sent back to me. On the phone with them now.

I ordered a book, 4 weeks went by with no delivery, contacted the seller about it. He courteously offered to send a replacement, and apologized profusely because of the inconvenience. 

4 weeks later, no book nr. 1, and no book nr. 2. Obviously, things like this may very well be post office screw-ups, but I've never ever had an eBay item not delivered to me. I've ordered hundreds upon hundreds of items before from various sellers.

Contacted the seller again, they gave me a refund. However, to this date, almost 2.5 months later, nothing arrived (in case if it had, I'd naturally re-refund the seller's money).

Ebay,"Did not receive item, but seller is angry that I opened a case.","Some background:

I ordered an item from an international seller. The seller ships the item and it comes all the way to the local post office where it's been stuck for the past 2 weeks. 

I initiated a search request for the item at the post office for last week. So far no luck. 

I open a case on eBay for ""did not receive item"". 

Seller messages me saying it is unacceptable that I open a case since the item is clearly in the US. He/She demanded that I close the case so the funds will be available to him/her. I reply stating even if the item is in the US, I haven't received it and I'm not willing to pay for something I did not receive. I offer to wait one more week for the item. 

So, my question is, which is the right way forward? I can wait, but the last time I saw a status not updated for more than a week, it was never found. I don't have any confidence that the item in question will be found if they haven't done so already.

On the other hand, the seller did ship the item, and I kind of feel bad for his loss, but not enough to eat the costs for something I never received. 

After another week of waiting, what should I do? Should I close the case now and reopen a new one or just keep this one open?",16,8,2017-01-13,EBAY,0.10264473408460617,0.8670097589492798,0.030345493927598

Ebay,Won Auction for GBP 949. Seller cancelled. Then lists as BIN for 1199,"Hi

I will make this short as short as possible.

Won an auction for GBP 949 here in Europe. I pay right away. Seller then cancels order without any warning. I get refunded. I message him on Ebay asking ""Why"". No response. I choose send message to his PayPal email.

Seller replies that he is sorry, but that the item will not be ready until next week, because something is getting replaced under warranty and won't be ready until next week. Something I fully understand, and it was even mentioned in the listing.

I say: ""That's not a problem, I can wait"", to which seller responds: ""Sorry but I donâ€™t want a confrontation and disapoointment. I will re-list once it gets back to me""

He re-lists this morning the same item for GBP 1199. I email him that we should honour the deal, and that I have won the auction fair and square.

Still no response from him.

If he is reluctant, what are my options?

1) Negative feedback

2) Report, but for what? Duplicate listing? Inappropriate listing practices? This is my real question here, because I don't feel like letting him get away with it.

eBay say I have a number of days to review my returns dashboard. The only options are essentially to accept the return or message the buyer.

Again for the sake of argument let's say I am adamant that I will not issue a refund and not accept a return. PayPal freeze the payment, fine, I expected that.

But now what? Will this case escalate to a human at eBay to review or will it just automatically sting me with a PayPal reversal if I do nothing at this point?

FWIW, UK private eBay auction, no returns accepted (but I see eBay can allow returns if an item is faulty).

Ebay,Buyer wants me to contact amazon for a refund?!,"Hey there,

about 3 weeks ago I sold my ASUS MG248Q Monitor. It always worked fine for me and did til i sold it.

The thing is it missbehaves with AMDs freesync feature, when enabled it cuts off like 3 pixels or so, idk really. This is a firmware bug which appears with every single MG248Q Monitor. ASUS isnt able to fix it and from what i know they wont.

Reddit post of this bug:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/566i7u/asus_mg248q_adaptive_sync_cuts_off_pixels/

I never used FreeSync so I didnt know this bug exists. But the buyer on Ebay does, or experienced the bug. (What brings me to the conclusion that he/she knew about that even before they bought it on ebay, so they would make profit out of it)

Now, what the buyer wants from me is that i contact amazon, claim this bug and demand a refund. Then I am supposed to send her the retun note so she can send it to amazon. Amazon will refund it to me and thaaan i am supposed to send her the money.

When i bough the Monitor it was like 350 Euro, sold it for 250, so she/he would make good profit.

My question is, do I have to do that shit? I really dont want to write Amazon about that since i bought the Monitor 6 Months ago and I return enough stuff to Amazon allready.

What rights does she have in this case. I am from Germany if this helps.

Sold an item on 1/4 (wed) and didn't get to ship it until 1/9 (mon). The item sold with free shipping and I mailed it first class with tracking in the US.

He replies ""Item is lost, send refund"".

Ebay,eBay defective item case win chance?,"Buyer states item is defective but had used it for 15 days, I had a 14 day return policy with 20% restocking, so on the 15 or 16th day the buyer opened up a claim saying it was defective, but also stating he only has the phone, and threw away the box of the phone.

Can I win the case if I escalate to eBay? This possibly looks like buyer's remorse, and he threw away the box/accessories that came with the phone. Below are the details.

Reason

Doesn't work or defective

a buyer buys it now, gets the alert its paid, get a message from the seller with the details in.
Get the mrs to post it, she has lost the tracking code :(
Get an email from ebay saying the sellers account has been hacked.so i ring them and they say i need to wait for a dispute through paypal from the buyer.
Checking all the paypal guides on their website and it seems like im not protected as i sent to different address listed on the buyers paypal address
Does this mean im going to be out of an apple watch, and out of Â£220.

Ebay,The eBay Formula,"Hi guys, I've started ebaying for just a couple months now and wanted to work out a formula to know how much I need to sell at what margins to make x amount of profit. Since I could not find a formula so to speak, I thought I'd make one with my limited knowledge and wanted to share it with those who are on their new journey as well.

This formula assumes a few things such as:

1. no eBay store
2. default paypal and ebay fees
3. no listing charges
4. no postage costs as it varies, unless you've deducted it from your average sale margins
5. no misc/operational costs ie ink, paper, etc

I have derived the following formula. It's obviously not 100% accurate and I may have missed some things to consider so please let me know if I have. Nonetheless, it is a good formula for giving you a rough idea to understand what's required to hit your goals.

P = T x (1.13 + 1/(1+m) - 0.3/y)

Where

P = Profit Before Tax (yr)

T = Total Sales ($)

m = Avg. Sales Margin (%) for eg. 40% margin = 0.40

y = Avg. Sales Price per item ($)

To work out how much profit after tax, such as your net:

Profit After Tax = (1-Tax Bracket Percentage) x P

In Australia, if you are running it under a company structure, maximum Tax Percentage is 30%, therefore:

Profit After Tax = 0.7 x Profit Before Tax

So to hit, let's say, a profit after tax of $150,000, you need to do close to $500,000 in sales if you have an average 40% profit margin and average $50 sales price.

Ebay,What to do about scratched ipad?,"Hello,

I purchased an iPad on eBay which the seller described as being in ""absolutely amazing"" condition, with no further details. I did not think to ask any questions about the condition, as I assumed it would be very good. The iPad arrived, and it turns out there are scratches all over the screen (too many to count), some of which are as long as 10cm and others which curl around. It seems they have arisen due to the use of an Apple Pencil.

Upon seeing the condition of the screen, I messaged the seller to ask if I can return it. He replied stating that he is partially sighted, but that he believes the iPad was in perfect condition for its age (6 months). I have another iPad which is 18 months old and in significantly better condition, so I cannot see how this is true. He has referred me to his policy of no returns. Surely this is irrelevant?

I have replied back more assertively asking for a refund. I also questioned how, being partially sighted, he could have accurately assessed the condition of the item. My question is, do I have a reasonable basis upon which to make a claim that I should be allowed to return the iPad? Does the presence of scratches on the screen contradict the description, which is rather vague? If the seller refuses again and I have to take this to a dispute, how certain am I to win? I don't think the scratches would show up too well on photos, since they are not deep (merely numerous). 

The reason I ask is because I would like to go ahead and buy another one, perhaps not from eBay this time, but I would not want to end up being stuck with this one as well.

Ebay,Frustrated with how ebay handles cancellations and notifications,"I purchase many items from ebay for my business and I am hoping someone here can shine some light on my troubles.  We need to keep record of everything so that we can keep the technicians and clients informed of when items will arrive and when they were ordered.  I continue to run into problems with sellers though, where I purchase and item and then days later the seller will cancel and refund the money, but I will not receive a notification from ebay and the item is removed from my purchase history.  How does ebay expect me to keep track of items that need to be reordered?  Sometimes I'll think I'm crazy as I know I ordered a motherboard or charger and suddenly it's just gone and hasn't arrived and the client is left frustrated and we have no record of anything.

My second problem is when I need to return an item and I let the seller know that it is defective, Ebay never notifies me if and when the seller has approved the return.  I can't tell you how many times it's been approved and then I never return the item because it falls through the cracks.  For anyone wondering how that could possibly happen, try ordering hundreds of items a week and then keep track of what needs to be returned, without ebay notifying you of it.  We put everything into a pile, that is damaged and needs returning, and have to dig and dig and dig to figure out when and if the return has been approved.  Again, the item just dissappears from our purchase history so it is not easy to keep track.  We leave notes on each item that is purchased so we know whom it is for and how to contact them, this is erased as well.

I got home, scheduled a redelivery for the next day, signed the orange slip and left it at the door. They didn't take the slip until Tuesday of this week. It is now Friday, no package has showed up still. I called my local post office this  morning to see if they can redeliver, but they have no idea where it is.

Ebay,Cant ship audio speakers from Japan due to terrorism???,"Hi,
First time to post on here..but I really didnt know where else to turn to....
Recently I sold a beautiful mint NOS pair of Yamaha NS10M studio speakers to a customer overseas through ebay. Ive sold and shipped speakers before in the past but not recently. Imagine my shock when my wife receives a call from the post office saying speakers are prohibited and cannot be shipped due to magnetism. Apparently this went in to effect in Japan sometime late last year specifically banning export shipping of all audio speakers. Their reason...apparently something to do with terrorism.. Now Im aware of the restrictions on magnetized material (Magnetized material with a magnetic field strength of .002 gauss or more at a distance of 7 feet) but personal sized speakers simply don't don't come anywhere near this measurement... The really puzzling thing is that there is no information in English on the web that I can find anywhere relating to this... if suddenly you couldn't send or receive speakers I'd expect fairly heated conversations popping up on the web but theres nothing..silence... Also there is no information that I can find anywhere on the Japanpost website (Japanese or English) in relation to this restriction. My wife rang Yamaha and they were aware of the problem and seem to be quite pissed about it. They said (of course) all their speakers are within the regulated limit for magnetism. We were to told to tell the post office this information. The post office accepted the new information from Yamaha and last night confirmed that they could go ahead with shipping. Alas this morning they called back and said it didnt pass postage clearance. So back to square one. Im sure its possible to go with a private shipping company like fed-ex or DHL but they are a lot more expensive than Japanpost.
Something just doesnt make sense here. I just look at the information I have, or lack of and keep thinking, am I missing something here? Is it somehow a local thing (Im in Hokkaido)..I do know that Japan post (in most cases very reliable) is like some dumb machine in which the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing.

Ebay,Phone broke after buyer used for a day. How to handle this return situation?,"This is really frustrating me as I don't know how to handle it. I recently sold a phone, a Nexus 5X, on ebay (of course). The phone worked 100% perfectly when I was using it daily up to about 2 weeks before I sold it and I had used it daily for about a year and a month.

Now there is a somewhat common issue with this phone where it *bootloops*, meaning it just restarts forever and is permanently broken. My specific device was a color/storage configuration that was very unlikely to have this issue. I sell the phone, and the buyer says this bootlooping issue is happening within a day of using the phone, ugggh!

He even stated that he didn't know what it was and had to google around to determine the issue was called *bootlooping*. So the phone broke in his possession, he claimed I would have known it would break. But it if broke in my possession it would have permanently been broken and I wouldn't have even sold it. I explained this and he sort of agreed. 

So who's at fault here? I had no idea the phone would break as I was under the impression it would never have the bootloop issue. So I don't technically have to refund him, right?",14,3,2017-01-22,EBAY,0.09307019412517548,0.8749120831489563,0.03201768919825554

Ebay,Looking for some insight on this refund case.,"Hey /r/ebay

I'm a lurker here and just wanted some opinions on this case before i refund a buyer. The item in question is a used otterbox defender iphone case. Buyer contacted me a few days ago basically saying he wants a refund and can send the case back as the case's screen protecter piece is coming apart. I told him i was unaware of this and don't remember it having that issue. He says he will just be in the same spot with his case so I offered him a refund and he could send it back if he'd like, but i'm having second thoughts. He didn't respond and now a few days later opens a return case. The problem i have with this is i'm curious if he might try to send his broken case back and if the case was actually coming apart or if he may have damaged it himself. He has been relatively nice and even provided photos. Should i just refund him and cut my losses? At this point i'm not even sure it's worth it to have him ship it back as the shipping rates here in Canada are like $5 to ship a bubble mailer to the states. 

Thanks :)",9,3,2017-01-23,EBAY,0.024770641699433327,0.8910974860191345,0.08413191139698029
Ebay,New seller question - case opened,I just had an auction sell for a good amount of money ($420) and it's been two days and the buyer hasn't paid.

Ebay,Mistake in listing noticed after bid received,"I told my mother I'd received a bid on an item she gave me to list and she pointed out that the item is not actually real leather like my listing says it is. I should have paid more attention and not made that assumption - lesson learned. 

I'm annoyed that I'll be letting the bidder down and when I message them to let them know I want to ask if they're still interested in the item despite it not being real leather. 

My instinct is saying cancel the item now, message the bidder and let them know what's what and relist it. 

Does cancelling a listing with bids affect my seller level or anything else? 

I've also considered adding to the item description to make it clear that it's not leather. I know I won't be able to amend the title. Would this amendment along with messages on eBay be enough to prevent the buyer winning an INAD case?

I doubt the buyer will be interested since it's not leather but perhaps they're buying for the style..

Ebay,Scammed by a seller. Whatever. I'm over it. My question is why?,"Pulled the trigger on a Lululemon hoodie, which is a high end clothing brand I think made in Canada. There's a seller in San Diego that only sells Lululemon new items. Does not to appear to be licensed seller for the manufacture or anything officially tied to company. Sellers prices are lower that most.

I purchase the hoodie on a Tuesday. Tracking number get added Thursday. No movement on item, not even the initial scan at post office. Send message asking status on Sunday. No response. Yesterday was the last expected day of delivery. Today I opened an ""item not received case"".

I know I'll either get the item (unlikely) or my money back. I'm just annoyed at the issue. However, here's the kicker. I check the seller's ratings, which I guess I should have done first, I know. Seller has 16K+ ratings over the last 10+ years. About 1700 feedback are from the last year. Of those, 25 are neutral of negative. ALL complain about the same issue, which is my issue. Ordered item, never received, no communication, ordered canceled. 

Why would a seller do this? I get every seller might occasionally sell something out of stock, but their track record seems excessive. And why add a tracking number? If you are out of stock, why not just cancel the order? I guess I'm just curious and hoping some experienced sellers can chime in with an opinion. 

Thanks in advance. 

EDIT: Scammed seems to be the wrong vernacular here. I guess this is just a bad seller.",17,7,2017-01-24,EBAY,0.1136399507522583,0.8618912100791931,0.024468785151839256
Ebay,(repost) eBay/PayPal surprising seller protection example (USPS return fraud),"I originally posted the text below about ten days ago. Reddit deleted it. The auto message I received said it was because I posted from a new account. This is the first(second) time I've ever posted to Reddit. 

I read this forum occasionally and I notice all the negativity. I identify with most of it, eBay is a tough market for sellers. I originally posted this because it's an example of eBay/PayPal sticking up for sellers and I thought others might find it useful. Hopefully Redditbots won't kill it twice. 

Original message below:

Iâ€™ve run a small business for 6+ years, eBay is our primary marketplace. We sell items to a niche market that isnâ€™t as subject to fraud attempts as some(phones, consumer electronics etc). But we still have to deal with bad buyers from time to time.

Iâ€™ve always been critical and dismissive of eBayâ€™s seller protection policies. In my experience if a buyer raises a SNAD request they pretty much always win. Same goes for returns, if USPS tracking shows the item was returned to your city and zip code they take it on faith that it was delivered to your address(most of you know that online USPS tracking does not include the actual delivery address). 

These policies have burned me many times over the years. Iâ€™m used to it and expect to lose payment, shipping fees etc in these situations. However, both eBay and PayPal surprised me recently when I had to deal with a scam attempt. 

Week 1, day 1: A new account eBay buyer purchases a $100 item and pays with PayPal. PayPal flags the payment for review, asks me to hold shipment until it is approved(this happens frequently when buyers have a new PayPal account or have modified info in their account). 

Week 1 day 2: PayPal review approves payment, item is clear to ship. Item ships the same day. 

Week 2 day 1: Buyer opens return request, states the item does not work. This is an electronic item that was tested before shipment, but we have no way to argue condition so we approve the return and provide a return label using eBay return center. We print the return label digitally and upload it to eBay along with the tracking number.

Week 4: Buyer escalates dispute to eBay because we have not refunded payment. We did not refund the payment because we did not receive the return, but I check tracking and it shows the return was delivered. We ask our mail carrier about the lost shipment. Our carrier checks the GPS information for the delivery scan and it shows that the item was delivered to a WalMart in the same zip code as our office. (I had no idea the USPS could check GPS locations on delivery scans.) The carrier offers to investigate this further. 

Week 4 day 1: I call eBay and explain the situation as I understand it. Iâ€™ve experienced these delivery scams in the past, I know itâ€™s possible to deliver a return to a random address in the sellers zip code so eBay will think the item has been returned to the seller. I explain this to the eBay rep on the phone. I know he will tell me that they canâ€™t do anything about it because USPS tracking shows it as delivered. Iâ€™m not surprised when thatâ€™s exactly what he tells me. I report the buyer using eBayâ€™s mechanism for this, I do not expect anything to come of this. 

Week 4 day 4: Iâ€™m surprised that eBay hasnâ€™t refunded the payment and closed the case as they have always done in the past. I remain surprised for the next few days.

Week 4 day 5: The USPS carrier shows us a picture of the package that was delivered to the Walmart down the road from our office. Apparently, the USPS now makes pictures of the packages when they are scanned at delivery. Again, I had no idea they did this. The picture they provided was of a flat poly envelope(the original item shipped in a box) that did not have our return label. Rather, it had several pieces of label chopped up and taped to the envelope. One was the address of the Walmart, with a return address of the same Walmart. Another component was the indicia code of the label we printed(the section on the upper right that indicates the postage paid). It also had a lone barcode without the numerical tracking ID printed next to it. We asked the driver to scan the barcode from the pic and it showed the same tracking ID as the label we sent to the buyer. 

Week 4 Day 6. The buyer opens up a PayPal dispute. The eBay dispute is closed automatically when the PayPal dispute is opened. I call PayPal, expecting to hear them tell me they canâ€™t help, because Iâ€™ve heard that many times in the past. The rep listens to my story and says they are aware of this scam and they will investigate.

Week 5 day 1: PayPal closes the case in our favor. I check the buyer on eBay and the account is no longer registered. 

We win. Sort of anyway, we had to jump through a bunch of hoops and do a lot of extra work for a $99 item that we usually sell without complication. Itâ€™s kind of pathetic the lengths some people will sink to defraud others over modestly priced items purchased online. Thankfully itâ€™s a rare occurrence, and itâ€™s encouraging that seller protection is more sophisticated than I expected-at least in this one example.",11,7,2017-01-24,EBAY,0.0759483128786087,0.8934603929519653,0.03059128951281309

Ebay,"Looking for some insight on a case -- as a seller, reporting a buyer","Hi everyone! I'm relatively new to selling on ebay, I just started a few months ago and it's been going smoothly except for this one case today. 

I sold a new item and the buyer received it today. She states that it's definitely not new, not the same consistency, messy bottle, etc (a bottle of foundation). I try to be polite to her, suggest some ways as a remedy (i.e. shake it, warm the liquid a bit). She tells me she already has shaken it. Later she sends me pictures stating that if it was new it wouldn't be ""so messy""... when literally, the product design is like that. There are photos and reviews of people opening this up for the first time and it's exactly like that. And then she sends me another message saying oh nevermind she didn't shake it and that she's going to report me and get full refund (with a bunch of exclamation marks).

Well, okay. I reported her saying she abused the buyer protection system. How fair is ebay with this? I heard in the past they are like 99% on the buyer's side. And how long(ish) until I get a reply? I've got messages archived and photos saved just in case for proof.

Ebay,Scammed by buyer,"Low feedback buyer contacted me through eBay on an active listing for a pair of high-end shoes and makes offer to transact through pay pal for lower price. I idiotically accept and send invoice. Buyer uses PO box address in Guam which I believe was confirmed on paypal.


So buyer receives shoes and claims it is damaged with a scratch on the side. We both agree this is not possible due to shipping damage because the shoes were well packed and shipped with protective coverings over each shoe. I ask for photos of the damage and am ignored.


Buyer opens a paypal claim for item not as described. I check buyer's feedback and looks like he has a similar case ongoing with another seller. I contact other seller to get his story which is basically the same deal.


I submit all kinds of supporting evidence to paypal resolution; photos, conversation history, ebay feedback etc. Paypal sides with buyer and decides a refund upon receipt of item is appropriate.


I call paypal for an explanation and any evidence that was provided from buyer. They tell me there was no evidence submitted by buyer except initial claim statements. Paypal rep agrees that is not correct and re-opens case for review.


About a week later, paypal again decides case in favor of buyer. I call again, this time rep tells me evidence was provided but they could not disclose to me. They tell me my only option is to accept the return.


Buyer provides tracking on return. Tracking states item is confirmed delivered. Paypal closes case immediately and releases funds to buyer.


I do not actually receive item, I call local post office for more information. Was told it was dropped off, they could not provide me with additional information; signatures, actual address etc. They do tell me the package was 1lb in weight. Original item weighs over 5 lbs.


I call paypal and inform them the detail from USPS and I am advised that an appeal would be open on my behalf and someone would reach out to me if further information is needed.


So that is where I am now. Pretty sure this is a lost cause and buyer is a serial/professional scammer. However, I want to make sure I am doing everything possible on my end.

Ebay,Patent Infringement Letter for reselling one item on eBay? [x-post from r/legaladvice],"I posted this over on r/legaladvice, but figured maybe some people over here might be able to help out as well:

Apologize in advance if this is a bit long, but I want to make sure I'm clear about what happened. Recently I received a FedEx Overnight mail package from an ""internet law firm"" regarding one of their clients, stating that I was infringing on their patents.


Here is the story of what happened: I purchased an item on Amazon, never used it, listed it new on eBay, and sold it. Done, end of story.


This mail I received states that ""[company name] is selling, offering for sale, and importing into the US a variety of products that appear to infringe on the patent. By way of example only, you are unlawfully selling, offering for sale, and importing products found on the following webpages:""


They then list 3 links. One of these links is my actual eBay listing. The other two are no relation to me whatsoever. One is an eBay listing from Texas selling the same product (I am from PA, so I have no idea where they drew that conclusion). The other link is an actual website for a company that is selling the product that they think is infringing - a website in which I have absolutely nothing to do with and have never seen before.


The letter goes on and on to describe the details of the patent itself, and then finishes with a request to (paraphrasing here): ""Advise all employees to cease conduct, provide an accounting of all sales, provide an accounting of all imported units, disclose the names of all persons associated with the sales, and maintain custody of all original books.""


They then end in the usual threatening matter of ""our client is willing to fully litigate this matter if it goes unresolved"" and so on.


Do I really need to even respond to this? I literally sold one of these products on eBay that was purchased on Amazon, and they seem to think I am the mastermind behind some patent infringing corporation (note that the Amazon listing has since been taken down). I would hate to have to spend money talking to a lawyer and sending a response back all because of a patent troll.

So I bought a book that stated the item location was from Indiana (US) and when I started the return process the seller requested the item to be shipped out to Malaysia.  I checked shipping prices via DHL and Fedex and the cost to ship outweighs the cost of the book.  

I asked if I can send the item to the location in Indiana, but didn't hear back for a few days so I contacted eBay directly over the phone and they just told me to wait another day for a response and see if the seller would provide a shipping label on their behalf.  

I brought this to attention to the seller bringing up the item location misrepresentation (http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/item-location.html) and told me that there was an error on eBay's side and that the listing shouldn't of stated Indiana but Malaysia.  The seller promptly made the changes on the listing that is currently still up, but made sure to take pictures of the page before they made the changes.  

What would be my best course of action to take?  I bought the item with PayPal so I was thinking of opening a claim against them with paypal protection if eBay were to not step in.  

**Edit**:  Tried to resolve the issue with the seller, but felt I was being stringed along to miss the shipping deadline date so I called eBay and told them about my situation and they ended up refunding me the total amount and letting me keep the book.

Ebay,"[Question] Does accepting a return for ""something wrong with the item &gt; doesn't match description or photos"" negatively affect my account?","I sold a textbook and now the buyer wants to return it. The buyer says that ""the book was not original and the content was wrong"".  ...

Clearly, this is ridiculous. I had 5 pictures of the book and shipped the exact item. The pics showed the front cover; back cover; spine; table of contents; and a close-up of the ISBN/UPC. The listing said it was in ""obviously used condition""; I specified that there may be highlighting or hand-writing in the book, and even that it ""may contain minimal missing pages"". Indeed, the book was in used condition, but there were no missing pages or egregious abuse or wear....

I think it's likely that the buyer bought the wrong textbook or edition and now they don't want it... But since I had 'no returns' selected, they're claiming it doesn't match the description/photos to force a return. 

I don't really mind them returning it. Heck, I don't really mind paying for the return postage... But if I accept the return, will my account be penalized for selling items that don't ""match description or photos""? 

Right now, my plan is to just accept the return and pay for shipping. But if it's going to cost me my top-rated status, I might as well fight it... right?

Ebay,Am I being reasonable or a pain? (Buyer),"So I won an auction on the 21st. As soon as it ends, I hit the submit payment, select PayPal, log in, choose my card, etc. done.

So several days go by, I figure it was a Saturday afternoon, so I shouldn't expect anything before Monday, but it's Tuesday night and still nothing. I decide to double check my PayPal account and see he still hasn't accepted the payment yet, so I decide to send him a message. I ask if there's something wrong with the payment and he replies a short ""haven't received anything."" I ask him if the email listed in the PayPal transaction is correct and he replies ""Yes."" I do some googling and think maybe there's something he needs to setup so I ask him if his account is fully setup, and he just says ""I go through PayPal"". I call PayPal to doublecheck everything, they tell me the email is invalid and he has to contact them, my payment has been processed correctly. I forward this information to him and all I get the next early-afternoon (25th) is ""I will check.""

I figured this meant he was going to check with PayPal. Instead, later I get 2 messages. One re-replying to my message about the email saying ""No, it should be X@gmail instead of X@whatever"" and another telling me he has no clue how I sent money to that email, I messed up and need to cancel the payment and restart the process. I tell him that email has to be linked to the listing, because all I did was click the submit payment and again tell him to contact PayPal. I hear nothing back, so when I get home I decide what the hell, cancel the payment and try again. Unsurprisingly the payment is again submitted to X@whatever . I provide a screenshot and again tell him I cannot do anything, he needs to contact PayPal, and if he cannot resolve it I will request a cancellation of the purchase. He said he will try to fix it, but I'm the only buyer who has had issues (basically still telling me it's all my fault).

As of today (26th) I have heard nothing from him and the PayPal transaction is still unclaimed. If I wake up tomorrow and nothing has changed I plan to cancel the transaction on PayPal and then request a cancellation of the purchase on ebay.

I would like to have the item, but the seller is literally putting no effort into this and acting like I'm the issue. Tomorrow would also be the last day of the delivery window if everything had gone smoothly with the payment on the 21st. He's not brand new, but only has 4-5 sells so far and at this point I'm not leaving a good review.

Ebay,"Bought a computer on ebay, shipping status now says: ""Delay at Global Shipping Center - Order Exceeds Size Limit"", internet says they will liquidate item and I wont get a refund?!","So the item got from California to Kentucky (still has to go to Canada where I am atm) however the order status changed to this today:

""Delay at Global Shipping Center - Order Exceeds Size Limit""

I googled that ^ and found this thread

http://www.allposterforum.com/index.php?topic=11159.0

Now, in their case they had a status of ""Undeliverable - Order Exceeds Size Limit"" not delay, so I'm hoping I'm not in the same boat, however this thread says the following:

&gt; I've checked the global tracking number on this item and I can confirmed that it has 'Undeliverable - Order exceeds size limit'. I can see that the items are generally liquidated if they are oversized, overweight, or a system restriction has occurred (i.e. item wonâ€™t clear customs). At which point the item is owned by Pitney Bowes (logistics company) and will not be return to you

and sure enough ebay's ToS actually says this:

&gt; eBay and Pitney Bowes shall have no liability and shall have, in their discretion and in any manner that they prefer, the right to dispose of or liquidate GSP Items that eBay or Pitney Bowes conclude are undeliverable, for whatever reason

&gt; eBay shall not be responsible under either the eBay Money Back Guarantee or PayPal Purchase Protection policies if eBay concludes that a GSP Item is not deliverable to your designated delivery address or to the collection center near you that is designated by the shipping carrier, for any reason

So if this is true and if it is indeed undeliverable then I very well might lose my money.

Ebay,"Received wrong item, how should I message the seller for either replacement or refund?","So I ordered a $300+ product and received a different, cheaper product whose only relation is that they're both products about the same television show.

Before purchasing I was a bit cautious as the product I wanted has been out-of-print for a few years and the seller's price was only a bit higher than the original, so I asked the seller for confirmation if this is that exact product.
He replied with a simple - ""Yes.""

So, clearly he was wrong after all, but I see the room for legitimate error on his part. He's a seller based in New York, yet the item came from Japan. I can see he out-sources some of his goods for direct delivery, so this could be an error on the out-sourcer's part.

I sent a basic message informing the seller and requesting either a replacement or refund, but this item is expensive and I'd like a more concrete protection over my purchase, as he could take a whole 30 days to get the actual item back from Japan after me returning mine all the way there.

-The return was not done through eBay's return system. He paid for return shipping and I never sent a label

Ebay,"item shipped to buyer's confirmed address, which was incomplete. paypal finds in favor of the buyer.","I shipped an item internationally to a buyer, whose confirmed address was incorrect.  I printed the label directly from ebay.  It matches the one registered with paypal.  The package was never delivered to them, then presumably lost by USPS (it's been almost 4 months).  They opened a case, which Paypal decided in their favor, due to my not being able to provide proof of delivery, for obvious reasons.

Ebay,Best time to start an auction for concert tickets?,"When is the best time to start an auction prior to a concert starting? I have 2 tickets to a concert on a Friday night that I cant attend and aren't refundable, and Im wondering when I should start the auction?

The concert will probably be sold out, or very close to sold out, and I assume the week leading in the tickets will be most in demand.

Should I wait as long as possible, ending the auction on Tuesday night and asking for immediate payment that night or before business close on Wednesday so I can post on Wednesday for delivery on Thursday (with Friday as a safety net)?

Ebay,[UK] Advice on how to deal with Return Request for new eBayer,"Hi,

I haven't sold many items on eBay (only 37 Feedback) and just sold a Bluetooth speaker, it was brand new and I got it as a Christmas present but sold it because I already have one.

The buyer got a brilliant deal, just Â£3 plus postage, but I obviously had to send it regardless because he won it.

They just received the speaker and have submitted a return request. Saying ""the bluetooth connection is very poor and the speaker is like its going to cut out.""

With Bluetooth speakers the signal can be really shit, my Bluetooth speaker sometimes doesn't work on the other side of the room. It can also be affected by interference from other sources. It could be that the speaker is fine, but I can't be sure either.

I could get him to return it, but I'd have to pay return postage...

Anyone got any suggestions? I think his basis for returning it is poor, I've asked for a video or audio demonstration of the issue in the mean time.

I've refunded him the purchase price, but he's demanding the shipping refund.

When I refuse, he'll certainly leave negative feedback. Is this something I can have removed with a phone call to eBay?

I told her she needs to straighten thing out with her payment method, but she now wants me to send her invoice. this item has 20 watchers so it is easily sellable IMO so I would rather go not risk not receiving payment and wait another 6 days.

Ebay,Won Item: Buyer Gives Option to Buy Via PayPal to Avoid 30% EBay fees,"Okay so I'm not new to eBay. I've been using it since 2008. I however had all the time people sometimes want to do direct PayPal. I know sometimes this is a scam so I am not protected but I am really curious.

I bid on the 2016 MacBook Pro Touch Bar for around $1595. He says I can choose to pay via PayPal directly so he doesn't need to pay 30% fee. He also said if I do he'll knock down $200. So I'll pay him PayPal $1395 which sounds great.

So for him going through eBay he is charged 478, as opposed to PayPal he'd just lose out by $278 rather than the $478.

Is it fine to go directly through PayPal for him? what measures do I need to take other than not send him money as a gift? (An obvious scam that isn't unheard of).

Ebay,"Ebay refunded a buyer, TWICE!","So ebay as you all may know, have very bad customer service. Without sounding too prejudice, i can not understand a word they say! So i sold a laptop to a buyer who, 2 weeks later, claimed he/she had not received the item, which was unfortunate, but if he/she genuinely had not received the item, then they are eligible for a refund (which is fine). So the buyer opened a case, won and received a refund through paypal after the funds had been put on hold for the duration of the case. This happened sometime in early January (I opened a post office dispute to try and investigate the situation). So 2-3 days ago, Ebay ripped Â£70 from my bank account, for a refund. The refund had already been issued 2-3 weeks prior through paypal. So i removed my paypal as my automatic payment method so that they couldn't take any more of my money. Then, i rang my bank to try and dispute the transaction (I couldn't initially contact ebay). They told me they could not dispute it as it was pending. So i thought i had some time to quickly get this problem sorted out. I contacted paypal and opened a dispute telling them about the situation. They were very understanding and issued an immediate refund. I then contacted ebay and managed to get in contact with somebody to explain the situation. I could not really understand what the indian ebay employee was saying however she kept assuring me that, i owed ebay Â£70 and that ebay has paid for the refund and this is why i was billed. However, she could not understand that i was billed twice and after an hour and a half of tennis with me telling her that ebay had issued the refund twice and her telling me that i owed ebay Â£70, i hung up. I don't know who to speak to now but i would rather deal with this situation through ebay as a pose to talking to someone i couldn't understand and better yet couldn't understand the situation.

Ebay,Ebay Scam? Or was I too suspicious and hurt a legitimate seller?,"I had purchased a N64 system with 5 games on Jan 4.  The seller was a new seller (account was created in October of 2016).  I was the first person to purchase anything from him but I like to think that most people mean well but I am also always a little on edge when it comes to Ebay.  After purchase I received a message from him telling me that they didn't know how to update Ebay to show item shipped but he let me know that the console had been shipped and that it would arrive January 18.  They then uploaded a shipping number into Ebay, however, this tracking number didn't work with USPS.  After a couple messages went unanswered I hoped it would arrive so I waited patiently.  Finally on Jan 25 with him not replying to messages and the item not arriving I opened up a request with him.  He replied within 10 minutes of me opening up the request saying:

Hey man I have called the USPS and they said their has been a delay in delivery due to weather circumstances. Im not quite sure whats going on id like too know myself. Im gonna keep calling them until its back on the road to you sir. If its not there by the 28th message me again and i will refund you fully. But could you please close the claim?

Hello, I appreciate the quick response. However, I cannot close this request until I either receive the item or I get a tracking number that works.

Please contact me with the number and I will take care of it today.

That all took place on Jan. 25.  And that is the last I have heard from him.  I would have thought that if it was a scam he would have tried harder to scam me, however, he only sent the one message.

Ebay,Being Scammed,"I posted before but now I got the ""phone"" back so here's a quick summary. About seven weeks ago I sold a used LG V10 and shipped it to a buyer in Baltimore. Four weeks after the item was delivered to the address the buyer contacted me to request a refund and stated that the phone would not power on and is defective.

I had personally charged and tested the phone moments before packing it up and sending it away so I know that it worked. I did some light research and saw that my hands are tied with ebays return policy being so buyer friendly so I went ahead and accepted the return knowing that it was going to go the way of the buyer anyway.

The buyer requested I pay shipping so like stated above I just went ahead with everything due to ebays buyer friendly policies. Only the tracking eventually showed up with an origination from Ukraine! After reading more and posting here, I was sure this was going sideways so I called ebay as suggested and the rep assured me that the refund isn't finalized until I received the phone back and it arrived in the same condition it was sent in.

Yesterday the package was delivered while I was at work and when I got home to check it, I already knew it was too light. I opened it up to find this:

I immediately signed into eBay to open a case summarizing the events and saying to deny the refund and flag the seller as a scammer. I'm not sure what the next step will be but I had to fund my paypal in the meantime (not happy about that) and I'm still somewhat worried this professional scammer will find a way to cheat my out of my phone and money. But in any event, I will NOT be using ebay to sell ever again and this has been a hard lesson.


EDIT: eBay has initially ruled in the case of the buyer. UNFUCKING BELIEVABLE. I will be calling them after work with information regarding the freight forwarding address AND THE FACT THAT THEY TOOK MY PHONE AND SENT A NOKIA.

EDIT2: I called eBay and they are working it out for me. I will fill out an affidavit and we go from there. More than anything I want the buyer to get shutdown on the scam they are running but this helps.

EDIT3: Looks like eBay was going to reimburse me but decided to reverse the case results instead and refund is on the way. Took some work but really glad this is straightened out.

Ebay,Winner hasn't paid but is still asking me questions...,"My auction ended over the weekend and the winner immediately asked me if they could pay me later this week. I looked up the eBay policy on what happens if a buyer doesn't pay and figured, ""fine, if they don't pay me, at least I won't completely be left out in the cold"" and said okay. Over the past 2 days, the buyer has been asking me more detailed questions about the item (it's a piece of computer hardware - video card to be exact). I understand if you have questions on a used item, especially one that is a piece of electronics, but shouldn't they have asked me all these questions before the auction ended with them as the winner?

Anyway, they asked me one question during the bidding, and it was for a store invoice. I thought that was kind of weird since I've sold hardware before on eBay and no one has asked me for that before. I replied with an image of the packaging slip that it shipped with and I of course blacked out my shipping and billing address. Now they're asking if it has all the accessories and ""stickers"" it came with. I asked them to clarify what they meant by ""stickers"" and they mean ones that have the serial number on it. For me this was a red flag, since I've had to RMA computer hardware to the manufacturers before, and one thing they want to start the process is a serial number.

So that's where I'm at right now and not sure how to respond or go from here. Should I be concerned or should I proceed, business as usual?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.,4,3,2017-01-31,EBAY,0.01670045591890812,0.8449528813362122,0.1383465975522995
