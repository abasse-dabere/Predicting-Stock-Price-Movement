Ebay,I won an auction that had no reserve. Now the seller is refusing to sell for the price at which the auction ended.,"This auction had a starting bid of $.99 and no reserve. I haven’t paid yet because I had a question about the shipping. The item is a music CD, a pretty rare promotional single. I have seen several sell in the last couple of  years, and they usually go for $175 - 250 at the very most, with an average of maybe 220. I could be a bit off on those numbers, but that’s roughly correct.

Well, the seller refuses to sell for the amount I won the auction for (&gt;100). He says the eBay rules state that he has 30 days to decide if he wants to sell the item for that price or not, and that there is no way he will for that low a price. He says it is worth at least 475 euros.

Do I have any recourse here? Is this worth pursuing? Thank you for any help.",15,10,2017-05-01,EBAY,0.05436302721500397,0.8890511989593506,0.05658573657274246

Ebay,eBay needs to do something about abusing the visible price,"This issue is odd to me because it's existed for ages despite being a glaring problem. 

When a listing has multiple items with different prices only the lowest price is displayed in links from other items' suggested list and I'm pretty sure the ranking in that list also prioritizes based on that price. 

This is abused to hell and back. Say an item is $10, every seller has a dozen colors in the drop down selector then hidden away at the end is a random, vaguely relevant item for $5. No one is going to buy the random item but now the whole listing shows as $5 in suggested lists. That lower price jumps out and they get far more clicks. 

And of course my other favorite, sellers using stupid high shipping prices to hide the real price. One seller is literally bikes listed for $1000, shipping price $1000, if you do local pickup price is $1800. Nothing dodgy there...",14,25,2017-05-02,EBAY,0.06315145641565323,0.9038215279579163,0.03302701190114021
Ebay,eBay and Paypal Seller Protection is such a joke,"I am not a business, but an individual who has been selling my used personal stuff on eBay for the past 17 years and have a 100% positive feedback.  I recently sold a watch that I was no longer wearing.  Around 40 days later, the buyer requests a refund because it does not work anymore.  He explicitly stated in the refund request that ""It stopped working yesterday.""  From my perspective, it was working perfectly the past couple years I've owned the watch. And when the buyer received the watch, it was working great for almost 40 days until it stopped working.

I checked eBay's policy and it said that returns are only accepted within 30 days. So I rejected the refund. How am I supposed to believe that the buyer did not damage it himself when it was in his possession for 40 days? Anyways, I thought that was that as the eBay policy was clearly on my side. Then the next day he requests a dispute through Paypal saying the item was ""not as described"".  I opened a dispute, uploaded all the original photos, the original listing, the statement from the buyer saying that it stopped working around 40 days after he received it.  I thought, ""Even most brick and mortar stores don't receive returns after 30 days. I'm sure Paypal will side with me. It's been 40 days.""  Then Paypal sided with the buyer. I was surprised to learn that a buyer has up to 180 days (that's like half an year!) to request a refund through Paypal!  

Seller protection is such a joke. Will both eBay and Paypal refund me the fees? I mean what's to stop anyone from claiming that the item isn't ""as described"" whenever he/she has a buyer's remorse? A month, two or even half a year later?  What a joke.

Ebay,Scammed or am I just sloppy?,"It's hard to tell here, but I feel like I am in the wrong.  

Sold a shampoo on eBay.  I have sold them before.  Pretty boring, ""natural"" shampoos/conditioners.  I check the lids before selling.  They do not come sealed as far as a foil or plastic lid above the main spout goes, and many shampoos do not.  This one was expired - it said so in the description.  Buyer complains about the expiration - fine, whatever.  She then claims it's been resealed, which I don't even understand, and also that it's been watered down.  I feel like it's a product that separates over time, and especially near expiration.  To me, it's possible she could have been using this to try and get a refund/aka free product.  I did refund her in full (just under 11.00 US - shipping was free) and apologize, but I'm not sure what feedback will end up being.

Ebay,Buyer attempting to scam me. Seeking advice on how to proceed.,"Hey everyone. Long time eBay user here (account open since 2004) with 100% positive feedback. I use eBay a lot for purchasing but I have limited selling background (probably less than 20 items sold). I have a situation that I've yet to experience and I'm turning to the experts for some advice on how to proceed.

&amp;nbsp;

I sold a broken/for parts/as-is motherboard a few days back, and accurately represented this in the description and photos. Once the buyer completed his end of the transaction, I googled the address and noticed that it was a freight forwarder address. Never dealt with that before, so I researched a bit and saw that as long as I use Signature Confirmation, I should be fine, so I did that. Last night I noticed that delivery was attempted yesterday, but the business was closed and that delivery will be reattempted today.

&amp;nbsp;

I received a message from eBay this morning at 6:40am notifying me that a case has been opened by the buyer. The buyer stated that he received the item, but that it's broken, and is demanding a refund or he will write me negative feedback. See screenshot #1:

https://i.imgur.com/2dUPp8c.png

&amp;nbsp;

I thought this was weird as the delivery hasn't even been made yet. The freight forwarding thing was a yellow light for me in general, but obviously now this is a complete red light scam attempt. I checked tracking again once I got into my office and saw that the item has now been delivered at 8:49am and was signed for. See screenshot #2:

https://i.imgur.com/ONv16si.png

&amp;nbsp;

Given that my only available options are 1) Send a message to the buyer / 2) Add tracking details / 3) Refund the buyer, how should I proceed on this to best ensure that I'll have all of my bases covered? I guess I can deal with some fake negative feedback, but I'd rather not lose out on both the item and my funds.

Thanks for any assistance you can provide!

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR: Buyer opens ""hasn't received item"" case through eBay stating that he did received the item, it's broken, and will leave me negative feedback unless I refund. Item hadn't even arrived to his location at the time of case being opened. Item was sold ""for parts / not working"".**",19,3,2017-05-02,EBAY,0.087537482380867,0.8742360472679138,0.038226403295993805
Ebay,I need some advice on a claim for a refund (the seller despatched a faulty item but refuses a refund).,"[I posted about this originally a couple of days ago.](https://redd.it/68h47u)

I was reluctant to claim for a refund initially because this is actually the second time I've tried to buy this bundle and I didn't want to go back to square one. 

However, I slept on it and decided in the end that I should go on this sub's advice and so in the past hour I called eBay, told them about it and on my behalf they opened a case for a return and a full refund as follows:

| | |
|:-:|:-:|
| 02 May | You created a return |
| Reason for return | Doesn't match description or photos |
| Comments | I want a full refund because the focusing screen is missing &amp; one of the batteries is not working. |

The seller has since responded with the following: 

&gt; Hello As stated I will not be issuing a refund. The camera is in perfect working order. I will send you a brand new battery to make up for the issue. In terms of the focusing screen I checked this before I sent it so I do not believe this is missing. These can be bought on ebay for £15. 

Now, I had a reply drafted but I haven't sent it because I want to get the tone right and I want to go about it the right way. 

The first problem I have is that the seller is now admitting that their listing was misleading.

They are happy to send a replacement battery but that is the most minor problem here. 

They claim to have checked the camera beforehand and dispute that the focusing screen is missing. However apparently I should know that I can buy one for around £15? I have been quoted $35 on /r/Photography and the focusing screen is definitely not there!

The camera is not in full working condition if the focusing screen is not there! This is a major problem! 

Right now I really want to demand that the seller proves that the camera was serviced as they claimed in the listing. 

If the camera had been serviced, there wouldn't be a focusing screen missing and the sensor would have been cleaned instead of covered in dust as I received it. 

If the camera has been serviced I can then just ask them to find the focusing screen or send me a new one.

What are your thoughts? What should my response be?",8,3,2017-05-02,EBAY,0.19954438507556915,0.7674463987350464,0.03300929069519043

Ebay,YOU OWE ME 50 CENTS!,"This is pretty tame for ebay but I know a lot of the power sellers will have something like this happen from time to time. Anyway, story time. So I sell cheap football cards on ebay. I don't make much money but oh well, that's for another day.

I have a promotion where I offer a buy one, get one 50% off deal. This deal works on all cards priced $5 or less. You add all the items you want to the cart and you make your purchase and ebay automatically applies the discount. It works multiple times too, so if you buy 10 cards, 5 of them would be 50% off. Pretty simple.

However, if you make an offer on an item and it is accepted, the deal doesn't work with that offered item. So for example, you want two football cards. One is $1.28 OBO and one is $1 BIN. You make a $1 offer on the $1.28 card and it's automatically accepted. Then you buy the other $1 card. So your total bill is $2. With me so far? That's where the story begins. This exact scenario played out and then I got this message.

Mr. 50 Cent: your checkout didn't give me 50% off on morris card. you owe me 50 cent on order

Me: You have to add all the cards of your order to your cart, at their listed price, and then purchase to receive the buy one, get one 50% off. Because you made an offer on the (other) card and the offer was accepted, it doesn't apply to the deal. ebay's checkout process handles this discount automatically, so if you were owed any savings, it would've been applied to the order already.

Mr. 50 Cent: That's fine, don't expect any future orders from me!

Two minutes later...

Mr. 50 Cent: Your listing say buy one, 2nd card 50pc off. Nothing bout all the other stuff. If you need the 50cents that bad keep it. When I sell I do the best I can to keep customer satisfied.

Me: Every item in my store has basically the same item description and in that description, it says:

""For all buy-it-now cards $5 or less, you can BUY ONE &amp; GET ONE 50% OFF! This deal works multiple times, meaning if you buy 20 cards priced at $5 or less, 10 cards will be 50% off. This deal does not work if you make an offer. Just add the cards you want to your eBay shopping cart and make your purchase. No coupon code necessary. eBay will automatically apply the discount.""

It says right there, the deal doesn't work if you make an offer and again, ebay applies the discount automatically. If you were owed a discount, ebay would have already given it to you.

Ebay,Something smells fishy....,"Hi All,

I'm an inconsistent eBay user (mostly just sell things when I'm doing spring cleaning, old electronics, etc.) and just recently sold a CPU (I upgraded).  Buyer did a buy it now, paypal funds are already in my account.

Ebay,Buying shoes. Photos only have 1 shoe,"Hey guys,
 
I don't really shop on eBay much so you can say I'm fairly new. I'm looking at these shoes that I am looking to buy. The item condition says new with box. The photo on the other hand only has 1 of the shoe in it. 
 
Now, this may sound like a dumb question but, can you only sell one shoe? I don't want to put in the order and get shafted in the end and only get like one shoe. But it is also a pair of shoe that's kinda popular so I don't want to miss this deal.
 
I have messaged the seller earlier today but no reply yet so I thought I would ask here too. He seems to have 2 accounts with a similar name and under 2 feedback reviews if that means anything. Both seem to sell the same/similar shoes.
 
 
Thank you for your help",5,8,2017-05-04,EBAY,0.026891984045505524,0.8960208296775818,0.07708718627691269

I saw in the description that they accepted bank transfer or cash on collect only but i turned a blind eye and paid immediately with PayPal when I won the auction.

Thanks for the purchase,please pay via bank transfer""

I was then told to ""cancel the PayPal payment and pay via bank transfer"" when I responded. 

My next email asked why it couldn't be PayPal and I explained that it's in the terms for sellers to accept PayPal as it covers both parties.

The response was:

""Because I needed it as bank transfer""

Ebay,Auction question,"So I always been buying stuff off ebay (not auction). Today I partake in my first auction. 

I was the highest bidder with 2 hours left at around $200. So the item was worth more than that, so I decided to increase the max bid to $310. So ebay will automatically bid for me if I get outbid. 

Right when the timer was about to end there was a single bid for $305. It trigger my max bid of $310 and I won the auction. 

This seems extremely fishy to me. Can the seller see my max bid and make a ""buyer"" account to trigger my max bid? If it was multiple people trying to bid for it then it seems okay. But it was a single bid just under $5 of my max bid. 

$200 to $305 to $310. This is how the bid looks like.",6,5,2017-05-04,EBAY,0.038190390914678574,0.9065456986427307,0.05526389926671982
Ebay,Buyer sends a returned item to their own address...?,"So I sold a dress off of eBay. Buyer wants to return it a few days after it's been delivered -- I have no problem with that, and they open a return case through the return policy I have. The address listed in the return details is my own home address, and I'm assuming that is the address that the buyer is supposed to send back the item, so nothing is wrong. Buyer ships out item, and then today I receive an email from eBay that the item was just delivered. But upon checking the tracking number, the item was delivered to the *exact same* zip code/city as the buyer.

So is this buyer just dumb and switched the return and send addresses or are they trying to scam me? It wasn't even an expensive item, like $20, so I thought they just made a stupid mistake but then again people try to scam others for anything these days.

I opened a case with eBay, stating that the tracking number showed it was delivered to a place that was clearly not my home address (different state and zip), and clearly not the one which was provided in the return details. What can I expect from eBay? I'll assume they'll side with me, but I thought that the label for a returning an item was automatically generated by eBay and not created by the buyer, so I'm not sure what will happen.

edit: Resolution of case (unless eBay doesn't follow through...)

I called a rep and she reviewed the case and told me that the return was indeed no longer my responsibility. She'd be closing the case (as of now it's still open, but I just got off the phone) in my favor and told me that funds would be released back into my PayPal account in 24-48 hours. Buyer would be blocked from leaving negative feedback and opening another return case. So yay!

Ebay,[UK] Is there any way I can outsource the postage and packaging of items I sell cheaply?,"Hi there,

I currently run a small online shop on eBay. On an average week I probably sell about 100 items. The products I sell are small and can easily fit inside a small padded envelope, which I send with a 1st/2nd class large stamp.

I currently work full time as well and it has got to the stage where I come home from work at 6pm in the evening and spend a further 1-2 hours writing out, packaging and sending off the envelopes. It is draining a lot of my free time at the moment and, as I plan to expand even further in the coming months, this is really not ideal.

Does anyone know if there are any organisations out there, suitable for small volume sellers, that I can outsource out the postage and packaging to for a weekly or monthly fee? I've tried searching online for something similar to no avail.

Likewise, does anyone have any advice on how I can keep postage costs down? Large stamps are not cheap!

So, the glasses sold and I was given this message when buyer paid-
FYI...These are not new in box. Back in the '70s, Libby sold them in 4-packs, but the 4-packs contained 4 of the same glass. They were released sequentially, with Terry the first release and Broom Hilda the last. There was a ninth glass planned, but. sales fell off and it was never issued. I forget the character, but altho Libby says it was released, no one has ever seen one. The author of one of the reference books offered $1000 just for a picture of it, with no results.

I responded - Wow, thanks for the info. I was not aware of this even after some researching. But I did catch my mistake in the title and made sure to edit the description. Thanks for the info!

buyer response- 
That's unfortunate for me, since the Broom Hilda is by far the rarest of the set.  Its value is more than the rest of the set combined. (i assume he didn't read the full description)

me- I sincerely apologize. i made an updated description note to the listing that specified which particular glasses I had. I typically list through the computer but also the eBay app as well which I have come to find is not as reliable unfortunately. I have already sent out your package however you can send it back to me and I will offer a refund including postage cost.

Buyer-
It's not a problem, it's still a good deal, with the Broom Hilda it would have been a great deal. The prices have been falling on these glasses in the last decade. I think people who bought them, both to collect and use, are dying faster than new collectors are arriving. Ten or fifteen years ago, at collector shows and antique malls, the Terry would cost you 10 to 20 dollars, the others would cost you 15 to 25, and the Broom H. was 100 to 200. Now you can find the Terry is less than 10, the others 10-15, and BH from about 30-60. Complete sets run about 100-125. This is from dealers and antique malls, sometimes you can find them much cheaper. There is a small premium for the carton. Of course, you'll see them priced much higher, usually by people consulting old price guides, but those rarely sell. I'm good.

I thought I'd share the outcome because there are a few learning lessons in it. 1. Dont make mistakes in your listing lol 2. communication with buyers can really help not just the sale but a buyers confidence in you. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I know I know, it's how it goes sometimes. However, I have these vintage Sunday funnies comic strip glasses listed and based on previous sales of the same item, I expected my $12 start bid to at least double. One of the glasses in my set of 4 went for $6-20 ALONE. So, I got 1 bid days ago and no new bids in  sight with only a day left to go. With collectibles or anything vintage, I find it to be the biggest hit and miss for me personally. Maybe the right buyer was out of town the same week my item was listed. Maybe I should have started the bid at my original price, maybe I should have done searches for that item more to see how often my listing comes up. 

I know many people deal with this, it just sometimes makes you feel a little unsuccessful for lack of a better word. I have 3 kids 13, 4 and 9 mo so I am currently a stay at home mom but do eBay as well as remote work, so I take pride in my little eBay business because it's not easy.

I really don't want to revise it, because it would attract more international buyers, and complicate everything (more hassle to do returns and refunds if international buyers are unsatisfied).

Ebay gives me this reply feature http://i.imgur.com/Ncrl7VZ.jpg Does this mean I can raise the price to cover shipping specifically for this singular buyer? Directly below the price box, it says ""shipping is not included"", but if I do raise the price, it technically will be included, but I don't know how to make the form recognize that fact, and I don't want this lack of clarity to backfire on me if the buyer chooses to open a case. Even if I say in the message to the buyer ""I have raised the price to include shipping"", the little price box still says ""shipping is not included"", and it's a technical feature which can be used against me. What am I supposed to do?

EDIT: Apparently Ebay only allows buyers to send offers that are LOWER than the list price. So now I can't even use *that* feature.",17,3,2017-05-07,EBAY,0.04078523814678192,0.9232301115989685,0.03598465770483017

Ebay,"Someone is requesting to return an item I sold when I marked ""No returns"" in the listing","Hi all,

So I recently sold a brand new computer graphics card on ebay and also marked on the listing ""no returns"".

The buyer today requested for a return with the reason being the component does not fit his laptop (to the non-techy people out there, it's pretty obvious the large graphics card I sold isn't going to fit into a laptop and is made only for desktops). And I've even listed in the listing this item takes a PCI express slot which laptops do not have. 

Now my concern is that if I decline the return, could the buyer leave me a negative feedback of some sort? I do not want to tarnish my 100% positive feedback rating. And not only that, but the buyer most likely opened the item meaning it's no longer ""new"".

Ebay,Approved a return but the buyer says they have thrown the item out,"I posted a few days ago about a buyer making an INAD claim saying a clothing item doesn't fit (fit counts as a change of mind return under eBay's policies) but it must have been mislabelled and they were very angry and were never shopping online again.




I decided to just agree to the return but first asked the buyer I found if they would prefer a partial refund, no response. I then asked if they would like a shipping label or to be reimbursed for shipping, still no response. When it got to the deadline I decided I had to just approve the return and see what happens. 




Today I get the following message:


""Hi 

I threw the top in the bin. I'm not wasting anymore of my time getting to a post office and sending you back the garment....A valuable lesson learnt Is I won't EVER purchase items sold on Ebay again......""





I feel they are just fishing for a refund and a free top now but I'm not sure what the right course of action to take is. Do I even bother responding to this message? Since they've said they have thrown the top out can I be forced into a refund still? As I'm certain they will leave negative feedback, what do you think my odds are of getting it removed?




I'm sorry if this sounds rant-ish, I know this community gets a lot of posts about bad customers but I don't think I've ever read one about the buyer throwing the item away and still wanting a refund...

Here are my classic red flags to start out with, and what I instantly block buyers for:

- Buyers who are even the slightest bit rude. If i only feel the SLIGHTEST negative/irritated vibe from a buyer, I ignore and block right away.
- Buyers who ask question after question/send more questions before I have been able to respond to the first one.
- Buyers who ask for discounts in a humiliating way ""Hey, I can pay $50 now""... of a $300 item. Sayonara!
- Buyers who ask things without reading the product description (answer is in the product description).
- Buyers who ask to ship to a different address/do the deal outside of eBay.
- Buyers who give neutral or negative feedback before trying to contact you for a peaceful solution.

These kind of people do most of the time end up giving you trouble, in my experience. Recently I never hesitate to block these type of buyers. Just right away, permanent block!

Ebay,Seller doesn't put enough postage on item. I have to pay extra $5 to get item. What do I do now to get my money back?,"I purchased an item two weeks ago. It was sent to my house last Thursday, and my husband texted me saying that the postman was requesting an additional $5 in order for us to receive it. My husband didn't have any cash on him so the postman took the package back with him and the next day left one of those pink slips in our mailbox for us to come get it at the post office.

Meanwhile, I had written the seller that Thursday advising them that we were being asked to provide an additional payment in order to receive the item, and I verrry nicely said that I wasn't happy that I had to do this, as it wasn't my responsibility for shipping issues.

I went on Saturday, paid the additional $5 in postage, and asked the postman while I was there what it was that the seller did wrong, so I could let them know. He said ""The seller used a priority mail box, but first-class postage.""

Long story short - how do I open a case to get my money back? The seller replied on Saturday that they were curious and asked for proof, as they had never run into that issue before and that they'll refund me the money once they ""have a minute."" Via the ebay convos, I sent them copies of the pink slip from the postman, a photo of the unopened package, and the receipt of my payment at the post office.

I wrote the seller again today stating that I have been patient, but I'll be opening a case as of tomorrow, as that would be 2 weeks since I ordered the package.

How in the heck do I proceed from here? Thanks in advance, everyone. I've been on ebay for years but I've never run into this (or any) issue so I'm kind of clueless.

**UPDATE** The seller has refunded me the extra money I paid so all is right with the world. Hopefully she learned her lesson (First Class v. Priority) and I have learned mine about how I am actually able to refuse a package through Ebay because of insufficient postage and Ebay buyer protection will still be in effect.

Once I got tracking info I sent it to him as proof and he thanked me and told me payment was on the way but I never got it. A day or so later I messaged him again saying that the shoes were out for delivery to my house that day and that I would be shipping once I got them and I got his payment. He again told me he was sending the payment then but I still did not get a payment.
Finally yesterday I got the shoes and sent photos to him saying they had arrived and once I had the payment I would send them out. He said alright but still did not send me payment.

Obviously I will not send the shoes until I have received payment but should I just cancel this sale? I am afraid even if he pays he will try and scam me once he has the shoes or something.

Ebay,Experienced Ebayers: how much of an advantage is there to waiting until later in the auction to bid?,"Ebay obviously has an automatic bid system.  Seems to me there are only 2 strategies:

1) Set and forget.  Decide, in advance, the maximum price I am willing to pay for the item, and set that as my original bid.  I won't end up overpaying for anything as Ebay always defaults to the lowest possible bid.  Main advantage: I don't have to spend time on Ebay or remember when auctions are ending.

2) Do the same as above, decide a maximum price, but bid as a late as possible. 

In theory, option 2 has no advantage: since I put in my maximum, and others can do the same, if someone else wins it's simply because they were willing to pay more than me.

Of course, in practice, this assumes other Ebayers are rational with regards to deciding how much they are willing to pay.  Someone may well start with a reserve in mind, but after an item sits at their previous bid for a while, start to persuade themselves that it's probably actually worth a little bit more than what they previously thought.  Or, of course, get caught up in the ""game"" aspect of it, and try and ""win"".

Because of the actual buyer behaviour, this would mean bidding later has an advantage; give people less time to emotionally ""acclimatise themselves"" to a higher price, and they are more likely to bid at a price that is actually lower than their theoretical maximum, and so are less likely to outbid you (or not outbid you, but still drive the price up).

But my question is, to more experienced eBayers.  How much of a difference does this *really* make.",16,6,2017-05-10,EBAY,0.03314530849456787,0.9167431592941284,0.050111494958400726

Ebay,"Account restricted due to ""possible discrepancy with the information provided at registration""","Today I received a message (and email) from Ebay saying:

I accepted the return and refunded him without having him bother to ship the band back — it was not worth the return postage which I would have had to pay because of the INAD claim.

Ebay,Guess the buyer doesn't want a refund anymore...,"Sold a diamond ring a month and a half ago. The buyer decided she didn't like it and initiated a buyer's remorse return. Several days pass and no tracking is uploaded. I'm about to call eBay to have the return closed out when the buyer sends an Email saying her package was shipped and she wants her money back.

I ask for tracking information which she doesn't have. One of my secretaries helpfully tells her it should be on her receipt. She finds it and give it to us. We point out that it says it's still in transit and we can't issue refunds until the item has been delivered.

For some reason, instead of checking the tracking herself, she goes to her post office and a rep there tells her that it's been delivered. Except that it hasn't. We don't have any package and the tracking doesn't show delivery either. It shows ""Out for delivery.""

We point this out to her and offer to call the post office to see if they can find the package for us. She ignores that and opens a case on eBay. She loses that case and opens a PayPal case. She loses that case and goes silent.

Three weeks later, the package finally shows up. We try to initiate a refund through eBay but get a general error message. We try to initiate a refund through PayPal. It says it can't be processed because there's an error with the buyer's credit card. We message the buyer to tell her to contact PayPal to resolve this error so we can send her the refund.

Instead, she leaves us a negative feedback saying we didn't sign for the return for 3 weeks. We call eBay and have it removed since the tracking contradicts her claim and offer to send the buyer a check and want to verify the address to send it to.

Ebay,"Buyer (with 0 feedback) wanted to return an item. Tracking says it was delivered, but I never received it.","So I sold an item on eBay, the buyer had zero feedback.
A few days later, the guy sent me a message saying that the product arrived broken. I asked him to elaborate, and he just repeated saying that it was broken. So I went ahead with the return.

Fast forward a couple days, the product says it was delivered. But I never received it. I opened a claim with USPS. They called me today saying that they can't find it and I'll have to file an insurance claim. Currently on the phone with eBay finding out my options, but was hoping to get some input from others. I'm thinking that somehow, some way, the buyer had ill intentions and is somehow responsible for the faulty tracking info.

A few things.. my mailmen **always** ring the doorbell and leaves the package with me when I get something. The mail gets to my house pretty early (9AM) and I was definitely home when I the mail arrived to my house that day. 

The tracking information says ""left in/at mailbox"". The mailman would be foolish to leave it at the mailbox, seeing as its way out at the side of the road, and it just plainly wouldn't fit in the mailbox. 

Am i just being paranoid? Or is it likely that the buyer is attempting to scam me somehow? I find it highly unlikely that all of the above happen and are not related. He has 0 feedback. He claimed the brand new item doesn't work. The return tracking information is wrongly saying it was delivered.

Just looking to get some advice from other people on what they would do in my situation. I sold the jacket for a pretty cheap price as it was (£30 - which is at least cheap in North Face standards).

It's now at the point where the buyer has paid me and I am going to refund him. My question is, do I print the shipping label so it gives him the option to request a refund? If so buyer may get upset about paying for return shipping, can this be avoided?

The other option is to go outside eBay and just send the refund through PayPal, but I know I lose all eBay protection, and the buyer has a chance to make $60 bucks off me on top of his refund.

Ebay,Seller shipped order that has cancellation request,"Original post for context: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/6agsjo/seller_gave_partial_refund_on_cancelled_order/?st=J2L9X420&amp;sh=48fb08ac

This eBay seller has been giving me the run around. They simply do not want to refund the rest of my order. I regret messaging them afterwards telling them why I cancelled it because they are using it against me.

Today, I called eBay customer support and they pretty much told me they'll send an email to the seller telling them to cancel my order and that I should just wait 3 days. Can eBay just force the order to cancel on their end? 

The seller told me that I only asked for one of the cases from my order to be cancelled. But I sent a cancellation of my order which included both cases through eBay so I know they're just bullshitting. Now they've shipped one of the cases even though I cancelled within five minutes of placing my order! Wtf, do I do now? Now I have to make a return request? 

The seller provided a tracking number through eBay messages for the item they shipped. It's not showing when I click my order because of the cancellation request. So, does this means it hasn't been shipped? When eBay steps in 3 days, will they refund me since no tracking or anything shows ups?

TL;DR - Seller ships the order I requested a cancellation for. Tracking and shipping info not showing in order details because of cancellation request. What should I do?

Edit: I've decided to wait it out and just accept whatever they shipped me. The case is cheap anyway so it's not worth the hassle of a return. I've learned my lesson to check listings carefully. ._.",2,2,2017-05-12,EBAY,0.11777209490537643,0.8592854142189026,0.02294246107339859

Ebay,"""Request total from seller"" question","Hi guys! I hope you can help me!

I was planning on buying three items from a seller, so I added those products to my cart and it gave me a total. Then I realized that the seller also has a website (it's a pretty big online makeup store), so I added those same items to my cart on the website and realized the shipping was cheaper there. I messaged them asking about the shipping cost difference between the ebay store and the website and their reply was this:

*Hello,*

*Thank you for contacting us!*
*Our U.S. eBay site will automatically calculate the combined shipping discount when purchased altogether at once. You can see the exact amount BEFORE you commit to putting everything in the ""Add to cart"". You can add, delete or modify any items in your shopping cart and see the total shipping cost. Once satisfied, then you confirm your purchase.*

*If you are buying from another eBay site, commit to buy all the items you want from us but do not pay for it. Ask us to combine the invoices into one and we will send you a new invoice with discounted shipping fee. I'm very sorry but I'm unable to give you the exact shipping fee until you make the purchase. Our shipping charge will be close to what it actually cost us to ship.*

*Regards,*
*Random Name*


Since I suppose the shipping cost is going to be cheaper than what I first thought, I decided to add two more items. The thing is that if the final price they give me doesn't meet my expectations, I would still want to buy three or four out of the five products I added to my cart, but not all of them. So I decided to do the screenshot of my cart so they could see exactly what I wanted to buy and told them if they could please tell me how much it would cost, explaining the situation. Their reply was the exact same message I pasted above...

So my question is: **if I request a total from the seller, but I don't feel satisfied with the offer, can I delete some of the items and request a new total or something similar? Or do I have to buy all of them?**

**The difference in shipping after I added two more items is $11 plus $5.5 that I have to pay in taxes in my country** (yes, we pay shipping taxes too). I really want to buy this things from this seller because it has great reputation and good prices. I also prefer buying from eBay because the return policy of their website is for store credits only.

Ebay,Buyer wants to return item after closing return request,"Hi everyone, I'm a pretty casual seller just starting out, doing some small electronics and video game consoles right now. 

I recently sold a handheld console to a buyer (east coast to west coast), and when they received it, they told me that it was having battery issues. I had listed in the item description that the console had a replaced battery, but was working fine. They told me they wanted to return the item, and opened a request, while I suggested a couple of possible fixes and offered to send a new replacement battery, which I'm 90% sure would resolve the issue. Paying their return shipping and after eBay and PayPal fees are taken out, I would be down about $40 or 20% of the item's value. 

After a few days of no replies, they told me today that the issue had resolved itself and closed the request, and I said I would send a replacement battery anyway. Just now, they messaged me saying the battery issue had come back and they would like to return the item again. 

I'm pretty sure I'm looking at negative, to, at best neutral feedback, for anything less than a full refund, which is going to hurt my margins a lot. We've been speaking very cordially, so I hate that this might turn nasty, but I can't afford the return, even though I would be happy to send the replacement battery. I'm just wondering, since the eBay return was closed, is there a way that the buyer can chargeback through PayPal or their credit card to force me to refund them?

Ebay,A Warning For Those With Stores Who Use Shop Holiday Settings.,"If you use shop holiday settings when you are away and tick the box which says ""Hide and block purchases from my fixed price listings."" then please note :

1. Buyers who are watching those items can still see them in their watched items.

2. If an item has ""Best Offer"" enabled those buyers can still send you a best offer on the item (they cannot do ""Buy It Now"" as direct purchases are blocked when your store is in holiday mode).

3. If the best offer item is configured to automatically accept offers above a certain amount then the item will be sold to the buyer who will then expect you to ship it even though your store is in holiday mode.

This is a serious flaw in the ebay holiday settings which they need to change, but they didn't seem to appreciate the seriousness of the problem when I spoke to them about it earlier today.",3,10,2017-05-16,EBAY,0.21088086068630219,0.7525988221168518,0.03652028739452362

Ebay,Protecting myself as a seller/weird buyer interest,"I'm auctioning a high end leather bag (though not a famous luxury brand) on eBay, and it's gotten far more attention than I thought it would, with several bids and messages outright. One bidder sent me a dozen messages asking to Buy It Now, as they desperately wanted the item. I wasn't able to check my messages and with each message they were essentially raising their price, to the point where it seemed like more than what I originally bought it for. 
I checked, and it seemed to be in stock on the product website, and for less than what the bidder was offering me for a used bag. I pointed them to the website but they insisted they wanted MY bag, which struck me as more than a little fishy... Other messages were offering me Buy It Now prices as well, for close to retail, and now I'm paranoid and suspicious of these offers.

My auction was cancelled because I had to verify my account, but this may have been a blessing in disguise. I didn't put sig/delivery confirmation on the auction, and I didn't know about the importance of only selling to a confirmed PayPal address. Could this be the reason for the ""interest""? Do scammers really crack down that fast?

Is there anything else I should know to protect myself absolutely? And lastly, if I do sell to a potential scammer but cover all my bases, are they SOL or is it just going to be a headache for me? Thanks ahead.",9,4,2017-05-16,EBAY,0.026545321568846703,0.9026653170585632,0.07078934460878372

I'm thinking of uploading them to imgur and sending them a link to the album instead. I figure that way if it is a scam they'll simply say they're no longer interested, though I'm also thinking they're potentially trying to get high quality photos to scam someone else for some reason.

Return started because they changed their mind when I had no returns, I offered to accept if they paid shipping back and my original shipping, they agreed.
Return told me to respond by the 16th, if I clicked the return it stated the return was started and if I dont receive my item by the 19th blah blah.  Normal return.

Or do i have to actually pay him again with Paypal. Because in my bank account, it already says the money has sent to him. But in paypal it says only that it has been refunded from before. He also listed the item ""Unpaid item"",no clue if he is mistaken or if it actually didnt send through, do banks and paypal transaction occur a day after? I dont understand, should i just wait or?

( PS: Sorry if this was any confusing, pretty tired right now lol, Any need of revaluation on what i said is fine)",7,3,2017-05-18,EBAY,0.1056220754981041,0.8667159080505371,0.027662014588713646
Ebay,helpful tips for common questions (this is longer than I'd intended - constructive criticism welcome!),"I’ve noticed a few common themes in questions here, so hopefully this will help some folks out:

For buyers: 

Things are pretty easy – just make sure that you’re getting stuff sent to the right address and that you pay using PayPal. This adds an extra level of protection if you end up having a problem. 
If you have questions, haven’t received an item, or are dissatisfied with your item, talk to your seller – reaching out to them first is a great way to resolve issues quickly and with as little hassle as possible.

In general, you’ve got 30 days to open a claim. In the event that 30 days pass, PayPal offers 180 days of buyer protection.

If you haven’t received your item:

In your purchase history, you’re going to see an estimate of when the item will be delivered. If you don’t get it by the day after the latest date  shown there, check the provided tracking. If it’s stuck somewhere, reach out to your seller and see what’s up. They will likely be more than happy to work with you to locate the item. Don’t let this go beyond 30 days, however, because then you may not be able to open a claim.

If you can’t get ahold of your seller, or your seller is being uncooperative, 1 day after the latest day listed on the delivery estimate you can open a request with eBay (click on “more actions” and “I didn’t receive the item” (or similar wording.) ) The seller’s given 3 business days to work towards a resolution of the issue before you can go any further with eBay, so try and work things out with them. 

If they still haven’t resolved the issue or if you’re not confident that they’re working towards a good solution, you can ask eBay to step in. If there’s no tracking, or if the tracking’s been stalled for a while, you’re probably going to win the case. 

Once the item arrives, refund the seller – being out the item and the money isn’t a good feeling, and the vast majority of sellers are just people like you wanting to get rid of stuff and make a few bucks. They’re not super huge corporations. 

If the item’s tracking shows delivered, do some looking around your area and see if it maybe got misdelivered. Still open a claim, though. You’ll lose, but you might be able to recoup your loss via eBay or the carrier. (you have 30 days to appeal the lost case through customer service, just make sure to call them within that window to get advise on the best course going forward. 

If you get your item and it’s not right (broken, errors in the listing, etc…)

In the event that the item you receive doesn’t match what was in the listing, you have protection through the eBay Buyer Protection program. Reach out to your seller &amp; try to work out a solution. If you can’t reach your seller, open a return through the purchase history. (when you open a return, your item magically gets moved to the very bottom of your purchase history page.) 

Again, eBay gives your seller a 3 business day window to work with you to try to resolve the issue. In the even that they don’t, you can ask eBay to step in after that time passes. This doesn’t mean you _have_ to do it, just that you can. There are times when a resolution takes a bit longer to reach than 3 days would allow. Use your best judgement here. Again, you’re limited to 30 days after the return is opened to ask ebay to step in, so keep that in mind.
 
If you end up doing a replacement, the seller should accept the return which will give you a shipping label. Send the item back (you have 5 business days to do this – the tracking just needs to show that the carrier has accepted the package within that timeframe.) Once they receive the item, they’ll send you a replacement. Once you receive the replacement and are happy with it, close your return. 

If you’re asking for a refund, or if the seller can’t do a replacement, the same applies, only once the item gets back to the seller, they’ll have 6 days to refund you.  If you don’t the the refund, check with them to see what’s up – life happens, so be aware that sometimes it can take a few days to take care of things. If you don’t feel that your seller’s working with you, you can ask eBay to step in. 

Please only ask eBay to step in as a last resort. Most sellers are good people who, like you, just want to have successful transactions – Asking eBay to step in may cause damage to the seller’s account.

Once you ask eBay to step in, you’ll get a label, have some time to send the item back, and get a refund once it’s received. 

If you just didn’t like the item, clothing didn’t fit, the color is horrible, etc.., you may be able to return the item to your seller. 

Check their return policy. This type of return is called a “remorse return” and is different than an item not as describe return in that you’ll be responsible for any shipping costs and there may be a restocking fee. 

You may be tempted to say that the item wasn’t as described – don’t. If you open up false returns in this way, it costs your seller and it may end up causing problems for you in the future (not being able to buy, not being able to use returns, getting your account and any linked accounts permanently suspended.) 

Feedback

You have 60 days from the date of purchase to leave feedback. You can’t edit your feedback once it’s sent unless the seller sends you a revision request. They only get a few of these a year, so be mindful of that. Take a step back, try to work things out with the seller and only leave negative feedback if it’s warranted. 

Don’t use feedback as a weapon. It’s your opinion of how the transaction went. Most are going to go through without a hitch, so let other buyers know how yours went. If you try to work things out with the seller and are unsuccessful, leave feedback that reflects this. 

Don’t leave feedback when you’re angry. 

Cancellations

You can request a cancellation. Your seller will probably agree to this, but they don’t have to. If they do, they’ll refund you &amp; you’ll be on your merry way. If not, check and see what their return policy is. If they offer returns, open one up &amp; send the item back. Keep in mind that seller’s are likely to approve cancellations if you are civil and let them know why. If the seller’s shipped the item, they can’t cancel it, so keep that in mind.

If you don’t pay 

eBay gives you 2 days to pay for your item, unless the seller requests immediate payment. If you don’t pay within this time frame, they may open an unpaid item case for the transaction. This isn’t a huge thing, you have 4 days to pay once it’s open. Once they close it, the transaction is cancelled. If you want to cancel, ask to cancel before this happens – once the unpaid item case is opened, the seller can no longer cancel the item. 

Try to avoid unpaid item cases – if you get too many of them, many sellers will block you from buying from them. 

For sellers: 

eBay’s a great place for casual sellers and for those who are more serious about making money on the internet to reach a rather huge buying population. 

A couple of quick tips to start: 

Fraud’s really rather low. Sure there are some categories that have a higher incidence of sketchy behavior, but even then it’s the exception not the rule (and by a pretty huge margin.) 
If you approach things from the prospective of Hanlon’s Razor (“Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity”) your life will be about 100,000 times better. 

You know more about the site. You check your messages more often, you’re more invested in the transaction than they are. If they don’t get back to you right away, they’re probably not twirling their hipster mustache and evilly thinking of ways to take advantage of you, they’re probably just not as quick to reply as you’d like. They might expect you to reply immediately, if not sooner. We can argue fairness if you’d like but that’s the expectation – you don’t _have_ to respond right away, but that can cause friction. 

Communication is the key – the more in the loop your buyer feels, the less likely they are to go off the deep end and cause you problems. Keep in as much contact as they require. I am really low key. I know the rules, I know how things work, chances are you’ll never hear from me. A new buyer may not behave the same way – some handholding might be necessary. 

Another thing to keep in mind is balancing “principle” and “the bottom line” – Figure out what your time is worth, then divide the total cost of whatever item you’re tempted to go to battle over by that rate. If you’re ending up with less than your time is worth – you’re losing money. If you sell a 5 dollar item to a guy and he wants to return it, if you spend 10 hours fighting with him over the return, you’ve essentially cost yourself more than the return would have. Report the buyer &amp; move on. If you have clear cut documentation that the buyer is a scumbag, call customer service &amp; see what can be done about it. 

Keep everything in eBay. If the buyer wants to communicate outside of eBay, resist the urge. Pretend that whatever happened outside of eBay didn’t happen, because that’s what eBay’s going to do. It simply doesn’t count. 

If you have a problem with a buyer – report them. It’s anonymous, and it helps to build up a case against them if they’re doing sketchy things. If you don’t report them, you’re not doing anybody any favors. eBay may not be able to take action &amp; they live to be horrible another day. 

Tracking and Insurance are for your benefit. If you don’t have tracking, you’ll lose any item not received case that a buyer opens against you. Factor in the cost of paying out every item that you don’t get tracking on, because, worst case, that’s what’ll happen. (It won’t happen, you’ll probably be fine without tracking in most cases, but just be comfortable with a certain amount of loss if you don’t track items.)

Insurance is how you get your money back if the carrier screws up your item or if it gets lost. If the buyer claims that the item arrived damaged, your _FIRST_ response should be an apology quickly followed by an inquiry about the packaging. They’re going to get their money back, you should too!

Default to being the buyer’s partner in resolving the issue, even if you think they’re being less than honest – it’ll make them more likely to divulge the info you’re looking for. If you start out with accusations or challenges, they’ll get defensive and you’ll lose. 
The easiest way to do this is to put yourself in the honest buyer’s shoes: you just bought this thing that you really wanted and something went wrong. How would you want your seller to respond?

-
If a case decision is found against you, you have 30 days to appeal. Have your info ready, and give customer service a call. If they deny it – ask why. You might not like the outcome, but at least you’ll be better prepared for next time. 

-
If you need to ask eBay to step in – call first. If you don’t, you essentially lose your ability to tell your side of the story. Worse, your case might be adjudicated by a computer who can only see the bare facts. These may not tell the entire story. 

Ok – before I bore you all to death – a few practical things: 

Here's how you set up your selling account to protect yourself from problematic buyers:

click on ""Hi Your Name"" in the upper left hand corner of the eBay site. 
click on ""Account settings""
In ""My eBay Views"" click on ""Site Preferences""

there are a couple of items in this section that you may want to look into. 

In the ""Payment from buyers"" section:
Use checkout - yes
offer paypal yes
paypal preferred yes


In the ""Shipping Preferences"" section:

Offer Global shipping: yes (if you're planning on shipping internationally, only do it through the global shipping program (gsp) (more on this later)
exclude shipping locations:
- check all international boxes 
- check ""override for locations eligible for GSP"" (or similar language)
- check apply to all current and future listings. 

in buyer requirements check: 
block buyers without a PayPal account
block buyers who have received (x) unpaid item  strike(s) within (y) months
block buers whos primary shipping address is in a location I don't ship to
block buyers who have received (x) policy violation reports within (y) months
Apply settings to active and future listings

in ""Unpaid Item Assistant"" 
turn on the unpaid item assistant. 
select your grace period (no less than 2 days, no more than 32 days) if you want to auto relist the item after the case is closed, select yes. 

The unpaid item assistant is great because it automates the process for non paying buyers. If you don't turn it on, you have to open the case manually (sold list -&gt; more actions -&gt; resolve a problem) and then remember to close it four days later. 

Once the unpaid item case is closed, you'll get your fees back and the buyer is blocked from leaving feedback. 

GSP is great because it makes international shipping really easy. If you set things up correctly, all you have to do is check ""use global shipping program to ship internationally"" in your listing &amp; you don't have to think about international sales. If the buyer is in a location which allows your item, then they'll be able to buy it, otherwise, they won't. If the item gets to the kentucky depot, you're in the clear for any carrier related problems (lost shipments, items damaged by the carrier.) 

If you don't use GSP, you're probably going to hate international shipping. You have to pay extra for international tracking, which isn't offered by all carriers. If you don't, the tracking provided by the carrier ends at customs and if the buyer claims they didn't get the item there's no way to prove they did, so you're on the hook for the refund. If the item gets damaged in shipment, you're on the hook.

GSP can cost the buyers a bit more than simply shipping directly, but it also makes things easy for them, as the refunds are provided by eBay - they just have to open the case &amp; then you call eBay and close it out. 

Other things to keep in mind:

if a buyer requests to cancel &amp; you haven't shipped the item, just cancel it. It's going to take care of the refund (if they've paid already) and it'll block feedback (or, at least make it removable easily through customer service) - if you don't accept it, the buyer will probably find a way to open a return and cause you stress and annoyance - and they can still leave feedback.

Ebay,Is this a scammer?,"Hey, first time posting in this sub so hope this is okay.
I had an item up on ebay and it sold on Tuesday. I received a message from the buyer today (wednesday) telling me they were paying in 2 weeks time. As in, they didn't ask if they could pay later, but sent a rather rude statement saying they were paying it in two weeks time, when I hadn't actually asked them about payment yet.


I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't buy unless you have the money, and as it wasn't a particularly expensive item, I don't see why they shouldn't pay now. It's more of a principle thing in all honesty, and people not paying/trying to scam me seems to be a common theme on ebay, so I'm a little wary.


I politely contacted the seller pointing out that payment ought to be paid within 48 hours, and received a message from them saying it would now be paid next week, but that they would be paying via bank transfer. I found this a little odd, and again pointed out this was a bit late, also pointing out that I only accepted paypal - which my listing supports.


Buyer replied saying he would be paying by bank transfer anyway, and said that they had bid on lots of things over those past couple of days, and that each seller had said they would allow him to pay via bank transfer in couple of weeks. I'm extremely sceptical of that, and he also even made a massive deal out of how hard it was going to be for him to physically go out to the bank and set the payments up.
 I suggested he set up a paypal account and said it was something he could do from home to make things easier, and he said he didn't want to, despite having complained about having to spend more effort doing a bank transfer.


I then contacted him again and reiterated that I only accept paypal, and he very flippantly told me he didn't want the item anymore and to cancel it. Is the guy a scammer? It seems odd for him to moan about the bank transfer but refuse to use paypal - especially when it would provide him with protection too. A hunch suggests he may have a paypal issue, which concerns me


I forgot to mention, his account was only about 5 days old and had no feedback or anything, so I wondered if he had been bidding on things without considering that he was actually entering into a contract when doing so.",6,2,2017-05-18,EBAY,0.03197432681918144,0.9276785850524902,0.04034706577658653

But today AT&amp;T told me this phone is still on a payment plan. I did some reading and I think phones that don't people don't finish paying off become blacklisted.

Ebay,HELP - buyer trying to exploit money,"A buyer has been trying to exploit me for money/refund the past 2-3 days.

I had listed a fully working apple pencil (i am in the UK) and clicked on the international shipping program (buyer in France) 

The ad clearly states that I do not offer refunds also I changed £1 for local shipping to the international shipping program depot. 

As promised I sent the item within 2 working days. well bubble wrapped etc. 

The buyer then proceeded to communicate via ebay regarding the shipping times for the item. He was frustrated on 17th May as he didn't review ebay policy and didnt realise how the international shipping program works. 

He asked me where his item was and I told him from my point of view I have sent it to the depot within 2 working days as promised. He then proceeded to ask me for a refund as he did not want to wait for the delivery he said he would go and buy a new one and send mine back. 

I told him as per ebay ad i do not accept returns. He then demands the following ""I will ask for refurbished of delivery costs it is way too expensive for an object of a few grams, And too long,You will refund me the costs"". 

At this point I have mentioned again to him now the international shipping program works - and told him the delay is due to that and not mine. He then mentioned this ""You have chosen this form of delivery you had the choice of a simpler delivery cheaper and faster"" 

Now he is coming up with excuses to get a refund for this product stating that it is broken. I do not think this is genuine due to the above he has been trying to get a refund for various reasons.  I have a feeling he will break the item and show ebay it was broken etc.

Ebay,How would you handle a new buyer asking for a large order in the thousands?,"A guy with a very old account (10+ years) but little to no use (single digit feedback) has contacted me after purchasing an item I have.

He asked me if I could fill a very large order for him (which I can) that would range around $2400

Obviously, there's a LOT of concern I have about making such a deal, but also obviously, I want this to go through with and close it if at all possible...so the question: What would you do?

Knowing the loopholes in ebay/paypal we're all well aware of, I'm concerned with him claiming he never receives the item / claims items were incorrect / files return or INAD and sends me bricks back / etc, not to mention how people can file complaints something like 6 months after a transaction in paypal

He made a purchase from me already, so I could speak with him directly and try to arrange an agreement like half up front half on deliver, or a COD option or something, or perhaps just a wire transfer / money order?

What would yall suggest? Any thoughts on how to handle this in ebay in a way I don't have to fear getting scammed for 2400 bucks?

Also before it starts - The purpose of this thread is for input / thoughts / suggestions on how to arrange and complete a high value transaction with as little risk of danger as possible (if that is even possible going through ebay, otherwise alternative solutions). Please refrain from ""Careful, he might be a scammer!"" comments, I'm well aware of this and will keep screening as we go to make sure flags don't get raised.",10,3,2017-05-20,EBAY,0.04276348650455475,0.9242147207260132,0.03302176296710968

Ebay,Need Advice. I am a relatively new seller trying to avoid a potential scam.,"I recently went to eBay to try and sell off some things from my collection to reach a broader audience than I could on Craigslist or other buy and sell sites. I got an offer yesterday from someone saying that they will pay 20 over the asking price if I held it until Tuesday when they have money. Seems a little fishy and too good to be true but their feedback is all A+ except for one. That one is positive for some reason but says the user never paid for their item. I messaged the person that left that feedback but haven't heard back from them yet.

My main questions are how fishy does this seem and if I decided to sell to them and was paid properly what are my rights as an eBay seller and how can I avoid scams like the SNAD bait and switch? It is a pretty expensive item so I am a little worried but I also want to sell it since it has been listed for about 3 months now.

Ebay,Will my debit card work? (See description).,"Will my debit card work? (See description.)

Hello all, 

I am a new eBay/PayPal user. I am currently in an auction on eBay, but my PayPal account has not yet been verified (that is, I cannot transfer funds from my bank account directly into my PayPal account until it is confirmed, which may take a couple days). It does have my individual debit card as a payment option, and I seem to have linked the eBay/PayPal account(s) successfully. So, my question is this: 

In this auction, can I simply use my debit card as payment without any issues? Or does the bank account HAVE to be linked in order for the debit card to be usable? I just want to make sure I won't encounter any difficulties if I win the auction. 

Also, where does the final ""confirmation"" of purchase take place? Is it via PayPal or eBay? Will I just get a notification through one of the apps prompting me to enter my payment information and complete the transaction? 

Thanks for the help. I apologize, I am quite the newb. The listing on eBay does list ""Visa"" as a payment method, if that helps. Any and all insight will be very appreciated.",2,1,2017-05-20,EBAY,0.017071837559342384,0.9236977100372314,0.05923047289252281

Ebay,"Sold a motherboard that I made sure works before sending it out, even have proof (with triple channel DRAM), buyer says triple channel doesn't work - what should I do?","Hi,

So I sold a motherboard, and before sending it out, I got a bit paranoid and so took pictures, also a video of the whole system working, just before taking it apart and sending the motherboard off to the buyer. I even have the serial number, in case the person tried to send me their broken one (if they had the same motherboard).

A few days pass and I ask if everything is fine, I get no reply so I begin to sell my other components. Two weeks later (exactly), no feedback, nothing, the buyer sends me a message saying he/she can't get his triple or duel channel (on the mobo) to work.. I be polite and try and guide him through the process to make sure he/she's putting it in the correct slots, he/she says he/she is, but then still says things like ""slot 2"" doesn't work, when you should be putting it in slot A1,B1,C1.. Anyway, I've asked for a picture of where he/she's inserting the RAM, so he/she could be putting it in the wrong slot, or even his ram might not work be working..

I want to be nice, I've already sent messages trying to help, so now I am wondering what I should do? Is Ebay going to side with the buyer and make me pay for returning the product? The motherboard I won't even be able to confirm works because I'm missing a component.. What if it comes back and the ram indeed doesn't work any more as he/she says?

Ebay,What are the repercussions of cancelling an item with a bad BUYER?,"I just sold my first item on ebay, and its a pretty expensive item, so i decided to browse the buyers feedback to see who bought it and was alarmed to see that almost 25% of his 75 feedback were negative because he failed to paid within the allotted time, and failed to pay at all.

Also the buyer seems to be leaving a TON of negative feedback claiming that sellers have been selling him ""fake"" merchandise. This isn't looking good at all....

While the buyer has commited to buying by clicking my buy it now option, he hasn't paid. And i've had multiple inquiries with other potential buyers who have asked me to wait so they can gather funds and buy it.

My question is, can i cancel this bought item early solely based on bad buyer feedback, and would there be repercussions to my account? It sounds like bad seller tactics, but even disregarding the negative feedback, most of the moderate feedback listed the buyer as paying at the last moment.",16,2,2017-05-24,EBAY,0.5729612112045288,0.4050312340259552,0.022007625550031662

Ebay,"Buyer Left Negative Feedback for As-Is Item, Should I Do Anything?","I've been selling things on eBay to help pay living expenses (college student here), and came across a scuba dry suit from a reputable brand.

Well, the buyer (first time ebayer btw) left negative feedback saying the seals leak. He never contacted me, but this might be because I don't accept returns and said ""as-is"" in the listing. This is my first negative feedback point ever (I have about 750 points right now), and I'm trying to decide if the negative feedback is deserved or something I should contest.

Any input? I feel bad because the guy did pay $350 for it, but the msrp is $1500, and I did say it was untested. Does it make a difference if it was listed as ""used"" instead of ""for parts/not working?""",5,2,2017-05-24,EBAY,0.05951397866010666,0.9060502052307129,0.03443583846092224
Ebay,warning for offers to sell outside ebay,"Apparently ebay's system is now correlating messages sent from buyers with ended store listings that did not sell. I thought some of you may find this interesting.

Last week an ebay member sent me a couple of messages asking to purchase a high dollar item from me. Although they didnt explicitly state this, their request for me to call them struck me as a desire to buy off of ebay. I did not respond to either message. I did not call the member (although ebay would have no way to know even if I did). 

Today a different customer contacted me directly as part of my normal business (not ebay) to purchase the item, which was also listed on ebay. The customer came and paid in cash and picked up the item in person, so I ended the ebay store listing.

Three minutes after the ended item email confirmation from ebay, they also sent me a warning for offers to sell outside of ebay. This message stated that although no action was taken against me or my account, they wanted to reiterate that sales should take place on ebay, blah blah. 

I guess they have their system set up to look for items where buyers send messages to sellers and then that item gets manually ended by the seller within a certain time period (in my case about a week).  This seems like a dubious enforcement method and if they actually take action against accounts (mine or others') for no reason other than this, it's blatantly unfair. Hopefully I will never get to find out.

EDIT: as an update, I finally called ebay and spoke to one of the indian reps. She said that the warning notice I got was merely a duplicate of the message that was sent to the buyer, because the buyer had included his phone number in the message to me. She assured me, for whatever it is worth, that there were no flags or strikes against my account for selling outside of ebay, and that my account was in good standing.",17,21,2017-05-25,EBAY,0.053069669753313065,0.9119819402694702,0.03494838997721672

Ebay,What's the deal with all these $100 Gas gift cards for $93,"At this point deals.ebay.com is filled with at least 1 $93 gas gift card every day. It's always from the same seller (SVM). It used to be just BP, which was maybe understandable since their prices are usually a bit higher than their competitors, but now it is also Mobil which has the cheapest prices for gas.

Does anyone know what the business model behind these are? How they expect to profit and where SVM gets them from?

I have tried one and had success with it, I prefer it over using my card at a gas station or using cash. The only way I can see this as not being legit is if there are two gift cards with the same barcode duplicated and sent to two different people (so 2 people with 1 communal balance) and they just hope nobody notices.",9,8,2017-05-25,EBAY,0.026220744475722313,0.9228430390357971,0.05093624070286751
Ebay,Fast and Free Delivery but item's weight was incorrect.,"Seller reported an incorrect weight on their shipping label, which cost me $5 to pick up. Stupidly, since I've made this mistake before and immediately refunded my buyer, I just paid the fee and got on Ebay to explain to the seller and request the money back.

Seller isn't responding after a full week and two messages. Is this something I can open a case for? I can't seem to find a category that fits but doesn't require me to return the item.

If I return it, I pay even more in shipping plus a ""restocking"" fee. 

Since he advertised as Fast and Free delivery, and it wasn't, does that constitute a ""policy violation""?

**Update** Opened an INAD return because I'll just rebuy from someone else. That finally prompted a ""of course we'll refund your $5, even if we don't agree with it"" response.

Ebay,I Ponder : Mentally ill or delusional scammers ?,"I purchase a $1,300+ 10k gold necklace. 4 days later I receive a gold plated chain of a different style &amp; shorter length. I immediately open a return &amp; it takes the seller days to respond. He goes belligerent, claiming they do not even sale the type of chain I pictured. When a simple search of his current inventory shows several chains just like it. He asks for a picture of his hand signed invoice which low &amp; behold shows the chain @ 36 inches(I ordered 38) &amp; his own handwriting showing his error as he wrote ""38"" under the typed ""36"".






That's not enough for him he goes into a diatribe referring to the after world where thieves can't exist &amp; I am taking food from his infant seed etc.





After the rant he accepts my return request as I guess all the pics either made him accept his error or his disillusion allowed him to realize he could not win an escalated case. 



I ponder, does he really believe I switched items ? Was that just a temper tantrum to shield his ego from the fact he made a mistake ? Did he intentionally send me costume jewelry in hopes that my newish account would't be able to navigate the return waters ? His diatribe makes me think he deeply felt he was wronged, despite all the clearly presented facts that say otherwise.




I wonder if these people go through life w/ the same mind state that they convey on E-Bay ?


Ok I've vented but meanwhile I have  over $1,000 in limbo &amp; guy in NYC pleading to his deity to banish me from paradise lol.

Ebay,So it looks like turbolister is living on for a little bit longer,"Dear xxxxxxx,

As you may know, eBay announced in the fall 2016 seller update that Turbo Lister would no longer be supported starting in June 2017 and key functionality would be available in Seller Hub. 

We understand from our conversations and surveys that for some of you, a few of the Turbo Lister features you rely on are not yet available in Seller Hub. In keeping with our promise, Turbo Lister will continue to be available beyond June with limited support. 

What this means is that Turbo Lister users can continue to use the tool and contact customer support and the Community Board with questions. However, Turbo Lister is no longer available to new users and we will not be making any product updates beyond support for category changes. 

Meanwhile, we continue to add functionality to Seller Hub to make it the most convenient and powerful way to manage your selling from one convenient location. For example, you can upload listings in bulk with File Exchange, as well as create and manage listings from the Seller Hub listings tab. Regardless of how you list, we encourage you to take advantage of the unique competitive features in Seller Hub including performance reports, marketing tools, and growth and inventory guidance. 

We will continue to enhance Seller Hub and will keep you posted, as new features are available.

Ebay,Buyer requested full refund as both packages were taped together?,"I recently sold 2 printer toners to a buyer. Due to their large sizes i couldn't find a box big enough so taped the outer boxes together and sent them as 1 item.

They have said its fine and just the outer box has tape on. Im assuming they planned on reselling them for a higher price. Usually if someone is doing this they leave me a message with specific packaging instructions stating that the outer packaging must be in perfect condition for them and ask for protection. If not, i assume its for personal use and stick a lable on the outer packaging with their address on. This has never been a problem until now.

Ebay,Buyer claims unauthorized purchase. Second time this week on same item.,"Sold a high value item (~$400) earlier this week on eBay to a buyer that had 0 feedback.

PayPal ends up asking me for my tracking number and a description of what happened. So I respond with the tracking number, a picture of the shipping label and I upload the video of me packaging up the actual item.

I pay the monthly store subscription, so I get so many free fixed-price listings. It's not like I'm stealing from eBay when I'm still paying them something.

Is this okay? Could I get in trouble for doing this? If so, why? If I can accept cash in person, why not debit/credit cards handled by another payment processor?

Ebay,Got scammed... how to fight back?,"A buyer filed return request claiming the item is not brand new so he wants return. I approved his request and paid for prepaid return label on eBay.

USPS First Class Mail has a maximum weight limit of 13 ounces. The package I sent him was via FedEx, and it had a weight shown on tracking as 6 pounds. 

I don't know how to fight it. EBay policy is, if return tracking show delivered to the same zip code/city, the buyer wins. They won't even taken into account that it is impossible for buyer to return the real package via USPS First Class Mail due to the 13 oz weight limit.

Ebay,What do I do about a misleading item location?,"So I bought an item which I paid for in GBP, it was not free shipping, but it was one of those cheaper items you can get off eBay cheaply. However, I specifically picked an item which, slightly more expensively, shipped from Ireland. I did it for two reasons: because it would come to me much sooner (I'm in Europe) and I wouldn't have to pay my mailman extra for the delivery of the item, something that happens with small packages from outside of Europe. 

Upon inspection, I saw the seller was actually located in China. I contacted them and asked whether this specific item was really, actually, 100% in Ireland as the listing said. They said, 'Dear, we have a warehouse in Ireland'. Okay, so, not 100%, they didn't say yes, exactly, this item is in Ireland, but I felt kind of stupid for asking already, so... okay. 

The item was shipped out on May 15 and I just checked my Orders. It comes with a tracking number that actually works. It says it was accepted in China (Shanghai, to be exact) by Yanwen. If this is right (if they don't mass fake tracking) then is there anything I can do about this situation? Is it worth it? I'm kind of pissed off, to be honest. I know I can report this, but should I do this now or when the item arrives?

Ebay,Potentially bought a fake listing without purchase protection,"Hello!

I recently bought this item: http://imgur.com/a/vfi1B and paid for it impulsively. I didn't bother checking the seller too thoroughly.

After the purchase, I looked at the seller. The seller has over 6000 items, most of which are ripped directly off Amazon with a higher price. From a brief look at the seller's feedback, all of the items s/he sold are just from Amazon with higher markups. None of them had a discount-- the price was higher than on Amazon.

The item I bought had a discount of ~$150, and the seller has a few other items with huge discounts, which I think are likely fake. Also, a few hours after I bought the item, the seller supposedly went on vacation and won't be back until June 30.

The item I bought says ""Not eligible for eBay purchase protection programs,"" so does that mean if this listing is fake, I lost my money? I have already reported the item.",10,2,2017-05-28,EBAY,0.29791513085365295,0.6732279062271118,0.028856996446847916

Am I just screwed now?","I sold a brand-new unopened game console on ebay back in March of this year, and about a week ago the buyer messaged me asking for the console's original receipt so that he could return it, as he had sold it rather than opening it and his buyer claimed that the screen had a bad pixel. I replied that I no longer had the original receipt, and that even if I had, GameStop doesn't accept returns after 30 days; I suggested that the second buyer contact Nintendo about sending it in for a repair, because it might be a factory defect. The (first) buyer responds the next day saying that I sold him a defective item, and that he's filed a claim for a refund or replacement.

""Hey. I'm really sorry. We're having an issue with our paypal payment processing and our merchant account for some reason seems to be temporarily limited.

Go figure, you run a 100% feedback store for 2 years and Paypal still screws over the little guys.

Ebay,Return switched to partial refund.,"Had a buyer open a case for a refund on an item because they say the item was not fully working. I ended up accepting the return but then realized that I could not print a shipping label for them because I am from another country. So after speaking to ebay they said to have the buyer pay for the shipping label and that i send them the funds through paypal to cover it and upload a screen shot of the paypal payment as proof.

Well it ends up that it will cost the buyer more than double what I had to pay for shipping to send it back. With that cost and having  to re-pay seller fees again to relist it was becoming not worth it so I offered the buyer a generous partial refund instead and they accepted.

Ebay,New Ebay Image Policy,"Hi r/ebay - long time lurker, first time poster etc :) 

Just wanted to share my frustration and see if I am over-reacting. I received an email today saying that ebay (uk) are introducing a new policy - 

""From 31 July, you'll no longer be able to opt your images out of the eBay catalogue."" 

If you don't want your image to be used by another seller, tough! The only advice is to use a different image. This applies to any product, even unique, one off or handmade items. 

Personally, I am really frustrated by this. I spend a lot of time taking high quality images to make items stand out when there is a lot of competition. I do watermark them - but a seller could cover this if they don't mind a bit of the image missing. I am really considering whether to continue listing certain items on ebay.

Ebay,Buyer wants to return working item but wants me to pay for return shipping,"***UPDATE***

Thank you to those that responded with advice. I have spoken with the Ebay escalation team and they viewed the messages and have informed me I have no obligation to take this back. They said that if I did choose to accept it I could still enforce my return policy (including shipping + restocking) but that if anything is missing or damaged I will be liable with no recourse, so it seems like I simply can't take this back. I feel bad for the guy but I have to act within reason, obviously. 

They also told me that even if he appeals and is successful, the liability would then be on Ebay and not me, since they've advised me that I'm not responsible.

SO glad I asked this question before acting.

***END UPDATE***

I will try to simplify this...

I sold a computer on Ebay. I do this all the time and have never had any issues. But there's always a first! 

So, guy leaves positive feedback. Then he contacts me and says 'I can't install this old operating system on it'. I try to be nice and help him out, but it goes nowhere. He is now returning it saying it doesn't work. However, it DOES work. His own message to me says it works as shipped. It just doesn't work when he tries to change hardware and install an outdated OS.

I have a return policy that states buyer pays return shipping and 15% restocking fee. He acknowledged that he read it. However, he now says I should pay return shipping because it 'doesn't work 100%'. I don't feel this is an accurate statement, but I'm willing to meet him 50/50 on return shipping.

In my experience Ebay favors the buyer in almost all situations, so my worry is he has stated in the reason for the return that the item is defective, so if I don't agree to pay the return shipping (which is a lot because this machine is heavy) he might file a claim and then I get a black mark plus I don't get my 15% restocking fee to cover some of this mess.

Fraudulent Ebay?
Over 2 weeks ago i found some shoes on ebay that i really wanted. They're not popular shoes, but they were heavily discounted. Look to have original photos on the listing (no stock photos) so i sent the ebayer an email asking if they had a buy it now price. She said make an offer, offered £120 and she said no, but she would take £150. Said yes to £150 but never heard back. Came to the end of the sale and i had won them for £99
 
I paid straight away by paypal, only to receive an email the next day asking for payment. I replied that i had paid, and sent proof. She said that was an old paypal accound and to cancel the payment and she would set up the correct paypal account and let me know when to pay. Waited and got confirmation from her to pay. Again, it went to the wrong paypal account
 
At this point she asked me to pay her directly through paypal and gave me her email address. I told her i couldnt pay at that point as both payments had gone out (£200 ish) and i couldnt afford to pay until i had my refunds. She understood and said she would send the shoes anyway - i never asked her to do this.
 
Fast forward a week of not hearing from her (despite countless emails asking what was going on) to receive a reply saying she had had to go to spain unepectedly with work and that she had sent the shoes (with a tracking number). At this point she told me that the postage would now be £25 and could i send payment asap - gave me a telephone number to contact her on to get the email address to send it to. The tracking number does work.
 
I informed her that she needed to raise a paypal invoice and i would pay. She has done this but it has come from a spanish email address paypal address (servicio@paypal.es)
 
She is becoming increasingly anxious and angry at me (understandably if she is genuine) but i have a lot of people telling me this all seems a bit dodgy

Ebay,Called eBay and they said they will increase my selling limit but still not increased,"Pretty much the title says it all, it's been 2 days since I called. Do I need to wait for a new month for it to increase? I got an email saying it increased but I can't list.",4,3,2017-05-31,EBAY,0.1274345964193344,0.5508838891983032,0.32168149948120117
Ebay,Need Help - Am I Being Scammed?,"Hey there... last week I posted a bike for sale on ebay. The bike was posted for $250, buy it now and local pickup only. I quickly received a bid for $200 and I responded with a $220 counterbid, with the request that the bike be picked up at my location. The buyer accepted. The buyer is in New York and said a friend of his would pick the bike up. (I live in California) 

The buyer sent the funds via paypal and the payment cleared, it's now in my bank account. In retrospect, I should've just asked the buyer to paypal the money to his friend and then have him give me the cash... 

The buyer has only communicated to me offline ebay, the guy that is to pick up the bike has a number from Portland, OR. Being that the funds are already in my bank account, cam I still exposed to a scam? What do you guys recommend I do to protect myself?

Thanks in advance.",4,2,2017-05-31,EBAY,0.03844817727804184,0.9232875108718872,0.03826427459716797
Ebay,Suspicious buyer for item,"So I put my laptop on eBay recently, somebody won it with 1 bid.  They haven't paid, and I haven't shipped.  Then the day after the auction ended, I got this email from eBay:

We had to cancel bids for the buyer, , because they aren't registered on eBay:
232344535041 - Samsung Series 7 Gamer 17.3in. (1.536TB, Intel Core i7 3rd Gen., 2.4GHz, 16GB) N

To help you avoid this situation in the future, consider setting a Buy It Now price and requiring buyers to make an immediate payment. For more information on immediate payments, visit:

We recommend you take the following actions if this buyer won the item:

- Verify any payments you've been notified of by logging into your PayPal account (or other online payment service).

Now, the listing was removed from eBay, but I still see it in my sold items, but it will not let me cancel the order.  It's been more than 48 hours, but I can't file for non payment, because the listing was removed.  I'm just wondering if I'm safe to go ahead and relist it, or if I could get burned in any way?",1,2,2017-05-31,EBAY,0.18199490010738373,0.7953749299049377,0.022630203515291214
Ebay,Shipping Scam as a Buyer,"So, I ordered three items last week from three different buyers, but all in one transaction. The first two items were delivered to me fine. The third was supposed to be delivered yesterday. I got home, no item was on my porch or near the mailbox. Checked tracking, it says my item was delivered to Honolulu, Hawaii and I live in Maryland. My address in Maryland is listed on the transaction in eBay, PayPal and that tracking document.

I reached out to the seller and they immediately responded saying I sent them an email after the purchase asking them to ship the item to a different address in Hawaii. 

I definitely didn't send them that...my thought it someone hacked my account or the sellers account. I can't find any suspicious messages or anything like that in my account to lead me to believe I was hacked, but who knows. Plus, my other two items made it fine.

I told the seller this and that the tracking had my correct address on it. He seemed surprised by that but said he wanted to forward this to eBay for resolution. 

Has anyone had this happen before? I feel like the seller shouldn't have sent my item to a non-verified address that wasn't on my account based on a  random email.",5,2,2017-05-31,EBAY,0.07611338049173355,0.8976894617080688,0.026197226718068123
