Ebay,"I sent out an item, the buyer claims it is damaged but won't send any images. Now eBay have sided with him in the return.","Hi r/ebay! 
I sold a minidisc player on eBay last week in an effort to get rid of some old stuff and get a bit of money.  I sent the item to the buyer who asked for quick delivery and a more expensive delivery option, which I complied with. I sent the parcel his way and thought that was that. After he received the item he sent a very rude email my way complaining it was broken, I asked for details of the fault but he did not listen, continually insulting me over the messaging system. It took two days to get the nature of the fault out of him. I then sent him a message asking for an image of the damage for proof, and that I had insurance on the item from the shipping. Therefore if it was damaged in shipping I could refund him and get the money back myself as he claims a shipping error. He refused to send any images, apart from one, in which he is too far to see any detail in the minidisc player and has his middle finger up swearing at me. He then refused to contact me for the remaining time.

At the correct time I opened an appeal with eBay, who then promptly sided with the buyer. I now have to pay return shipping, which will leave me losing money of more that half the cost of the item, and leaves me with a broken player, and outside of the time frame in which I can make a claim against the shipping company. 

This is where I am asking for your help. Is there anything I can do in this situation besides losing money? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",17,10,2015-08-01,EBAY,0.035791438072919846,0.9102027416229248,0.05400580167770386

Ebay,"Buying my first item, a rather expensive one at that","Okay, so a person (private seller) in germany is selling my grail watch. I have never bought from ebay before. He seems pretty credible, has sold a few expensive watches before, has 100% feedback etc.

He can just claim he sent the item and that I'm lying about not recieving the item. It's not like dhl checks the contents of the box at their office, to verify that theres a watch inside, not a rock.

Im really paranoid, as since i have no feedback, that ebay will side with him, if he decides to do this...

Ebay,How long before I can open an unpaid item case?,"I've looked around eBay for this but they seem to just say ""after a reasonable time"" which is far too vague to be of any real use. 

Basically, I sold a laptop/tablet on eBay on 29th July. The person I sold it to has 100+ feedback, 100% positive, has been a member for 3/4 months.

It's now the 1st of August and, despite sending an invoice (I didn't need to, but I did as a reminder to them sort of thing) on Thursday night, and then sending an email asking if anything was wrong on Friday night, it's now Saturday evening and I've still had no payment and no communication whatsoever from the ~~seller.~~ buyer

What's confusing me is their feedback. He's only been a member for 3 months but still that, along with their feedback, still seems unusual and too much effort for a scammer. So part of me is giving them the benefit of the doubt, but the other part of me is saying they never intend to pay because they haven't communicated. 

I really need the money at the moment so I need to either relist this asap, or have him pay asap. I can't go on waiting.

Ebay,Seeking advice about a purchase that hasn't shipped,"I bought a upgrade kit for a scooter on eBay yesterday. After purchase, I looked at the kit and realize I bought the wrong one. I immediately contacted the seller explaining that I purchased the wrong kit, and asked how can we fix it. The seller hasn't responded and I'm getting nervous. I'd rather swap the kit and pay any difference before it gets shipped. Once shipped, I have no use for that kit because it won't fit my scooter. That means returning it, then buying the correct one. 

Do I need to cool my jets, or should I be concerned the seller hasn't contacted me yet? I thought in this day and age, a seller would be quick to handle problems.

Ebay,"How does the ""buy it now"" function work from the sellers perspective?","What should I expect to happen on my end?

Ebay,Help with a return. eBay and PayPal not helping at all.,"Ok, so this is a long one.

I bought a laptop and the seller *said* they did not receive the funds, even though they were out of my account. The seller said they would not dispatch, but had already falsely marked it as dispatched. eBay and PayPal verified they were lying and that the funds had gone through. I opened a PayPal dispute for 'goods not received', so the seller panicked and admitted they could not dispatch until next week due to not having the laptop ready to dispatch.


Fast forward to when I receive the laptop, and it is in slightly worse condition than advertised (more screws missing etc) but nothing major. Then, about a week later, it begins to freeze more and more, until it cannot even boot.

I contact the seller, they accept the return, but want it through eBay so they don't lose the seller fees (apparently over £100). I can't process a refund via eBay because I previously opened a case through PayPal...bit weird if you ask me. I contact eBay, but they don't budge. They ask me to re-open the case through PayPal, but I can't, because I previously filed for a 'goods not received' case.

Now, I don't know where to turn. eBay are basically saying that if I'm screwed over once, I'm not allowed help if I'm screwed over again.

Ebay,Potential Dispute Question,"New Ebay Seller here,

(1)Replace and take the (L) 

(2)Offer a partial refund or some other consideration

Ebay,1.50 dollars insertion fee,"Hi guys, so here's my situation.

I started selling on ebay australia a couple of months ago. Today, I went on ebay.com to see if I could start selling my products there. At some point, I agreed to a ""Supplementary User Agreement"" without really paying attention to what it is.

In the end, I couldn't sell my items on ebay.com, and now everytime I want to list or relist an item on ebay.com.au I have to pay a 1.50 dollars insertion fee. I noticed this after having posted 7-8 new listings. My fee invoice is blowing up right now

Ebay,Canadian buyer being a pain in my hockey puck! Like to slap him with a hockey stick.....,"This comes under the heading of a rant more than anything else... I am sure I'll feel better after I vent some steam here.

I hear from the buyer - indicates not in a hurry, will pay in a couple of days. No joke - his words. 

Then in a couple days I get a invoice request from the buyer... who is in Canada using a totally different address. Let him know eBay requires me to ship to the original address. They don't care, and let me know eBay is being silly. I am going to close the case as payment not received and block this fool... but I *did not know* that the Global Shipping is over-ridden when you make an offer. That's right, when you send an offer and the buyer happens to be in another country using a US address - GSP no longer applies.

Ebay,Aggressive buyer - worried about negative feedback is there anything I can do to prevent it?,"I am just an occasional eBay seller that sells my old clothes and occasionally my friends clothes. I use my account to buy a lot also and I pride myself on my 100% feedback rating. 

I recently sold a used jacket which had a tiny cut/tear in it that I overlooked. I have always tried to overstate any faults/wear so that the buyer is fully aware of what they are buying in to but this one was an honest oversight.

My buyer has a only 17 feedbacks so she probably isn't that savvy on eBay. She got my personal details off the postage package and has repeatedly contacted me via my mobile. I know I placed it on there but it was for the postage service's use, not hers. She initially contacted me via text to complain, so I apologised and politely asked her to submit her refund/return request via eBay as per the eBay policies.

After seeing photos of the tear as well as the packaging to ensure it wasn't damaged by the postal service, I accepted the refund. I can honestly understand her frustration and was happy to refund as it was not as described and was my fault for not picking up the little tear.

 Unfortunately, I have never had to issue a return before and was unfamiliar with the process. PayPal tried to debit an account that I use infrequently (perhaps because it comes first alphabetically?). I thought it would give me the chance to retry the transaction using my preferred account like it does when I am purchasing items but it doesn't at all. On my eBay account, it says that it is waiting for her to accept the refund still. As soon as it bounced, I moved money from my preferred account into my PayPal, but it takes 3-5 working days. 

Of course, the buyer got sent a 'transaction reversed' message and again called me on my personal number demanding to know what I was going to do. She was quite rude, demanding and I felt really uncomfortable with her tone. It was aggressive and threatening. as eBay was telling me that it was waiting for her to accept the return, I said that she might have to accept it on her end again (which was incorrect) which angered her more. 

I am sick with the flu and was completely taken aback by her tone and demands and in hindsight wish I had asked her to send her message via eBay but the call woke me up and I was disorientated.

I am honestly trying to do the right thing by her and feel like eBay/paypals return process is a little flawed - how is it that I can't specify which account I want the return to come from? I occasionally use the non-preferred account so I don't want to remove it. 

What can I do about her calling me outside of eBay? It seems really inappropriate and a complete misuse of my personal details?

I am guessing she will give me negative feedback, is there anything I can do to show I have tried my best to refund her and follow eBay guideline? my many positive feedbacks are testimony to my honest selling reputation.

If I do get bad feedback? What is the best way to respond to it for the sake of other buyers in future? Any tips of what people have done in the past? 

What should I write on her feedback? I know i can't give negative feedback but I feel that her contact out of eBay should be reported.

Any advice is much appreciated.

Ebay,Should I be able to receive a refund in my case?,"Hi guys, bought a ""new"" phone from an australian/asia based seller, they have advertised this phone as new and never used, upon receiving the phone, I noticed it didn't have the typical protective sheeting and it left a residue upon peeling it off, i regret not taking photos of this. nonetheless I was happy, Unfortunately I bricked the phone through fault of my own. 

I took it to a repair shop, they noticed the phone was bent which later on I found out to be true, while slight, it was not ""new: unused"". I later noticed paint chipped off the power button and some sort of dust inside the camera lens. At this point i was quoted $180 to get a new chip set.

I wanted to see if the signs of previous use would grant me a refund, with the seller knowing the phone is bricked and me forfeiting the repair cost. I have since googled the seller and found a number of different forums stating they do basically sell used phones as new. 

I am currently discussing with the seller if I can get a replacement at least, but he/she is not responding very often and always leaves questions unanswered and says my photos aren't clear enough when I have sent [this](http://imgur.com/c3RkQaq) kind of stuff and had stated that the phone has been ""tested"" by his staff

Ebay,"Sold a PS3, buyer now claims it doesn't work..","Hey, so I sold a PS3 on the 2nd of august. just about 6 days ago...

It was in perfect working condition, and came with a ton of games, I sold it for around 150$ and in the description, I wrote out the only problem which was the included HDMI cable..

I said it's sorta wonky and doesn't work at times, but if you just move it a bit it works.

He accepted the terms and purchased the ps3, I ship out same day.

He gets it 3 days later, and leaves positive feedback saying ""It works great! Just as described! Fast shipping! Thanks""

Now he messages me, it's hasn't been working for the past 3 days. Which is weird because he received it the 5th. And he left feedback the next day..

So I'm curious, should I be worried the buyer is trying to return a non-working ps3, I think it might be worst nightmare I wish I'd never had to deal with..

I have 100% positive and have sold over 40 items in the past month. 

I shipped the PS3 extremely well, and it worked for him fine, but now he has buyers remorse and might be trying to scam me through ebay's buyer protection.

Any tips are greatly appreciated, I responded with this message..

""I'm sorry to hear you're having issues, the PS3 system was tested and checked the day it was sent out, and it was operating perfectly.

Just that the HDMI cable wasn't working perfectly, but it does work.

Have you tried connecting it to another TV? Or just keep using the old HDMI cable? If not that's my suggestion.

There were no issues when the ps3 was shipped and when you received it, so it's weird that have them now.""

Ebay,ShipSaver claim/refund dilemma and not wanting a defect. Please help!,"I Sold a pair of vintage USA made Chuck Taylors for a total, including shipping, of about $125. I shipped the package on July 9th to Thailand using USPS First Class and insured it with ShipSaver, which I have been using for just over a year but have never had to file a claim.  


The buyer sent me a message on July 26th saying that it hasn’t left the US. I checked the the package was last scanned in Chicago on July 12th, but it’s an arrival scan not a departure scan. 


I sent him a message letting him know it can take time arriving because customs ect. We have a few exhanges since then and he seems to want a refund. Yesterday (29 days after shipping the item) I started a claim with ShipSaver and sent him over the Thai affidavit page to him, but then noticed that ShipSaver allow a claim until 40 days after an item has been shipped. 


I sent the buyer a message explaining I am happy to give him a refund be we need to wait 11 more days before we can file the claim with insurance. Today His response was “Can I please have a refund”.


I don’t want him to open a INR case with eBay, but I also don’t want to be on the hook for $125 and not get a refund from ShipSaver because he might not sign the affidavit. 


My ebay account has 132 100% positive feedback, Above Average and a Bronze level Powerseller (whatever that even means) and I’m very close to being Top Rated.


I have 1 defect currently (1 out of 109) 0.92% for a previous INR case which was opened and later that day the item was delivered and closed by the buyer, from earlier this year (could i get that removed? haha)


Has anyone else been in this situation before or a similar one. What is my best course of action?

Ebay,How would you respond to this?,"I'm a pretty knowledgeable eBay seller, but I figure tap the hive mind to make sure.

I'll start from the beginning, I was selling a very expensive (~$1500) BNIB GPU. Some 0 feedback bought it, with overnight shipping to CA IIRC. I sell a lot of expensive stuff &amp; 99 times out of 100, this situation is a scammer. Before I had a chance to ship I had the money pulled for an unauthorized use claim. So I cancelled the sale, relisted, blocked the buyer and went on with my day. During this time I was also talking to another eBayer who was interested, at some point he stated he was the same person trying to buy it from the 0 account. So when I relisted the item I gave him the item number and he purchased it from the second account. (after I had blocked his first account) 

The shipping this time was to South Africa. I sent it and that's all I've heard about it until yesterday when I received the message below from him. 

Just to note, sale date was 7/7, delivery date was 7/16.

Couple questions: 

Because he mentions feedback, what are the chances if I just ignore his question &amp; he leaves me a neg I can have it removed for feedback extortion? 

 Because he bought it from another account after I blocked his first account and I have him saying as much in messages can I have a neg removed or block a return?


The message: 

""I would like to know where the driver CD is for the card before I rate you. This should hve been part of the box contents, but there is nothing.

So I had to get a new board, new ram, new cpu and a cpu cooling system to assist with the card's heat. My board had a 1155 sockt which has been discontinued and the new board was an 1150, that is why I had to get a new cpu as well.

Ebay,"Fedex Dilemma, advice?","So, I purchased a pair of Nike's on eBay a few days ago. The seller sent them via Fedex Ground, with adult signature (21+) required, don't know why but yeah. However, I'm only 20 y/o so when the delivery guy shows up on Friday he says he can't give them to me and that I'll have to wait until he comes next time (he said tomorrow, Saturday, but in reality it would be Monday because Ground doesn't deliver on Saturday) to have someone older sign for the shoes. I obliged and took the door tag he gave me which showed he tried to deliver it at 3:21PM. Then an hour later, the tracking page for my package claims the item was delivered and signed for by someone NOT me at 4:45PM and presumably delivered to the wrong address when on the same page it shows that an hour before that there was ""delivery exception, customer not available"" at 3:21PM because I wasn't old enough to sign for the package. I called Fedex and they say yeah it was delivered to my address yet I have a doortag and the tracking page even shows it wasn't delivered to me when he came (at 3:21). So, now I've had to open an investigation (which I won't be hearing back from for another 5 days) for a package that was literally in my hands but denied to me because I wasn't old enough (though I had ID that the package was addressed to ME) and now in the hands of someone not me, but hey at least they were 21, right?

Ebay,Tips for getting stuff to move,"As in, needed..
I've been a casual flipper/reseller for years. Most I've ever made was a few hundred dollars within a couple months selling bigger ticket items like electronics and music instruments. Slower moving items tend to be things like books and 99c store items (mostly as Seen on TV stuff). But I always see others pushing them rather handily, often at lower prices, and I often find I pay too much if I reduce the asking price. Part of it may be that I've had to start a new account since the one with almost 900 positives is permanently attached to a Paypal account that I shared at one time. 22 feedbacks aren't indicative of a long history. But I tend to do a lot better with ""quality"" items like electronics.

Ebay,"Seller sent me an empty box, claims they made sure the item was in there and immediately told me I'm a scammer. What to do?","*new update*
Seller still not willing to refund but says they will file a theft and package tampering report to the post office,  says mail fraud is a serious crime to both of us,  also says they will be filling a police report and tells me I should cooperate with the authorities.   That's fine and dandy and all, but it doesn't really help me and I'm highly dubious that police work hard over a 20 dollar item that passed across the country.   

Do I wait it out our just get ebay to intervene at its earliest? 

*update*
I checked the packaging again, it looks like the seller just didn't seal the bag properly so the contents were accessible without having to open it.  I guess they aren't trying to scam, just poor packaging and someone at the post office stole it.  Or maybe they did try to scam, but now there's reasonable doubt.  In the case of inadequate packaging, allowing it to get stolen, who's responsible for eating the loss in this case?  At least I can trust people again, although my faith in people doing the job properly is still lacking :/
*end update*

Bought a item recently on ebay, opened the package and there was nothing inside the case. (the one time I don't video the unboxing, 'doh) I actually went back through the listing just to make sure I didn't stupidly fall for one of those 'box only, nothing inside but booklets' listings, but it didn't look that way. I started a refund and informed the seller there was no game in the case and I'd like a refund or the item, preferably the item.

I've browsed through r/ebay and it seems like the buyer is usually the actual scammer in these instances, and I actually worried quite a bit this would happen to me when I was selling a lot last year, but it didn't, so I guess I didn't think this would happen.

This seller only had 1 feedback at the time and no photos of the actual item, just stock, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Looks like it bit me in the butt though. They did use tracking and it shows as delivered.  The package is very light and the missing item is also very light so weight discrepancy would be hard to argue.


I said I would return what I got, but they refused to refund unless it came with 'all the items in the case, and case.' Which is the problem, since I didn't receive my item and just the case, and if I did, I wouldn't want a refund.

It'll be a few days until I can escalate, but I'd prefer to not to deal with that. I did tell the seller that I know sometimes mistakes happen, maybe someone was using it and they didn't know when they packaged the case. They just directed me to try contacting USPS and ""sorry for your trouble.""

So, what are my chances and choices here?  I was polite and understanding, but their first response was hostile, then after I said that I would like to resolve this amicably, that I've had this happen before, and I would have to escalate but would prefer to just have the game, they became polite but stated their ""policy"" and ""sorry for your trouble.""",25,6,2015-08-09,EBAY,0.1456538438796997,0.826156497001648,0.028189698234200478

Yes I know it is eBay's sandbox and we are just playing in it, etc. BUT hopefully this thread will help other sellers who are being shut down by the resolution center by letting them know why or at least get a conversation going. Is this just ebay putting an obstacle out to reduce call volume to their resolution center? Is this just the theory of a madman? If anyone else has some ideas I'd be curious to hear.

Ebay,"Bought a PS2 on eBay, seller won't finish sale, and I haven't received refund.","Hello, I recently bought a PS2 on eBay for $20 with around $11 shipping, so $30 total. It had been roughly 5 days and I hadn't heard anything from the seller about a shipment, so I contacted him. He said that he canceled the sale because ""20 dollars is too low"" However, he didn't set a reserve on the auction so it is not my fault that bidding didn't go as well as he hoped. He also claimed eBay sent me a refund, but I read on eBay that they would notify me if this happened. I have received no notification and the payment is still there. So the guy now said that he didn't get a payment, but both eBay and Paypal say I have sent the payment, it is just pending and waiting for him to accept it. Also, when I check my eBay account, under ""Awaiting Feedback"" it still has the PS2 awaiting shipment. I feel like I am being cheated out of something I won for a decent, but not ridiculously low price. Is there anything eBay could do if I got them involved? I don't now how to handle this because this is the first auction I have ever won on eBay. Thanks in advance.",8,3,2015-08-10,EBAY,0.0636914074420929,0.8926504850387573,0.04365808889269829

Ebay,"Got mail from eBay about a suspiciuos seller, my recent purchase from them isn't covered by buyer protection","Yeasterday I've bought a camera off of eBay, and I'll admit it was a suspiciously good deal. The seller had a very good feedback score, so I wasn't worried until I got an email from eBay earlier today which said, quote:

""Our records show that you recently contacted or received messages from &lt;sellers name&gt; through eBay's messaging system. We’re writing to let you know that an unauthorized third party may have compromised this member's account security ...

...Don't respond to offers to buy or sell an item from this user. The offer may be fraudulent, and the transaction won't be covered by eBay....""

I've immediately tried to cancel the purchase via eBay Customer Service, which only gave me this message:

""Looks like you're not buying or selling this item. Choose another item, or look up an item number in My eBay.""

It looks like the offer was deleted, and eBay is acting as if it never existed on their website. 

Now the camera only cost me 20$, and if that's all it takes for me to learn my lesson I'll gladly take it, but now I'm concerned about my credit card information safety. I panicked and closed my paypal account, which I'm not really sure was a great idea, as it kept records of the purchase, but as I said, I was more concerned about the safety of my credit card.

Ebay,Buyer requests cancellation 3 hours after paying. Can I do this without screwing myself?,"Hi, I'm very new to selling on eBay, and I just had a ""buy it now"" item sell overnight. About 3 hours after the purchase was made, the buyer sent a message asking if I could please cancel the order. They said ""someone"" used the ""wrong account"" or something, but I get the feeling it's just buyer's remorse. They didn't say anything about resisting the item, just a request begging me to cancel after they had bought and paid for the item.

Anyways, I'm fine with helping out this person if they made a mistake, but I'm wondering if I can do so without screwing myself in the process.

Ebay,Scammed on ebay (possible workaround),"I listed an iPad a few days ago starting bid $1.  After about two hours the bid was ~$40. This was a three day auction.

I received a message from another ebayer suggesting that I take $80 from him right now ""to prevent the auction being won by a non-payer"". I thought that was odd. Depending on condition, this unit is going for about $140-170ish.

If I wanted to have a *buy-it-now* I would have listed a *buy-it-now* price in my auction. I didn't. I felt that the message was just a scammer who would quickly flip my device for a few bucks so I did not reply. In other words someone who wanted to take advantage.

The next morning when I awoke, my bid was above $160 which I found ridiculous (not thrilled AT ALL) because there was a couple days left in the auction and my experience shows this just doesn't happen.

When I examined the bids I noticed that someone had begun bidding at around that high price from the get go. In the remaining two days of the auction, there was no action at all. That bidder had run off the real bidders and was just going to out bid everyone else because he had no intention of paying.

You see, that bidder had just created an account *that day*, apparently just to bid for my unit and destroy the auction. Now, what a coincidence that for the first time in 12 years on ebay this has happened to me just when I was warned that it might by the message which I received from that other ebayer.

The auction ended two days ago and of course there has been no payment or response from my messages to him.

For those of you who are unaware, as I was, I read that you can somewhat prevent such happening to you by qualifying your buyers. As an example one of the things you can do is not allow anyone to bid who does not have a Paypal account. That alone would have prevented my scam because it takes time to open a Paypal account.

But there's just one problem, I have no idea how to start. I don't even know if I can, legally, start an ebay business as a minor. I'm lucky enough that I don't have my current job for money, but my parents wanted me to get it learn responsibility, how to handle money, etc. Unfortunately, now that school is starting back my time is going to be very stressed between homework, sports, and my job. My parents have given me the go ahead to quit if I feel it is getting in the way of my schoolwork. I've seriously considered this, but I still want at least a little bit of income. So selling on ebay seems like a great choice because I can work as little or as much as I want, It's a low risk business, and the idea of being my own boss/ owning a business has always sounded amazing to me. So I guess my questions are: -Can I, as a 16 year old, legally start a business (on ebay)? -Where do I start, is there anything I should absolutely have before starting? -How do I find my niche/ are there any products that will sell 99% of the time?

Ebay,[Help!] Buyer has opened case against me because they won't pick up their item?,"I recently sold a package very quickly after listing it. Great! I start packing it up for shipping when I see a message sent before the listing ended that said they'd have a day off tomorrow and could it arrive then? Well of course they didn't select the slightly more expensive one day shipping, so I just sent a polite message that with the shipping that had been selected it was unlikely.

Of course they are not in when it arrives (two days after despatch, pretty good for the service), so a ""we attempted delivery but you weren't in"" slip is left for them.

A couple of days later I get a message asking where the item is. I point out the tracking number which can be viewed on eBay (I put it in my message too) and check tracking myself, and pass on what it shows - that delivery was attempted on date X and it's likely gone to the sorting office.

Well here's where it starts getting shifty. I've been checking the tracking on and off and it shows the location of the item at their nearest post office (sorting office perhaps?) and they've still not collected. I check my messages this morning and they've opened a fecking case against me about ""item not received"" (why the hell can't the seller open a case of ""stupid buyer hasn't picked it up""?! /vent) saying that they appreciate it's ""not my fault"" (gee, real big of you!) but they weren't prepared to wait much longer and that the post office supposedly hadn't left a slip.

My reply via that system is polite but direct, basically explaining that as a seller I have done everything I can and pointing out that they have the means to pick up the package without the slip. I again check the tracking myself and show them where the item is, and say that all they need to do is take some info (that they have) and collect it.

Sigh. This is causing me a lot of stress. Basically, can the buyer touch me (they have threatened to escalate if they don't receive it) if eBay get involved? The buyer bought the item and knowingly selected a postage that was very unlikely to deliver while they were in, and is now seemingly refusing to pick it up.

Ebay,Changes To INAD Defects Are Coming,"I have been informed by several American CSR's that changes to INAD defects are on the horizon. I have received little information other than ""things are going to get better"" and a couple of reps have implied that management has noticed that INAD abuse is rampant and that the nature of how these are scored could change. I am wondering if anyone else has gotten any tidbits similar to this, and also if anyone has gotten anything more in-depth. 

I sell in a category where many would consider TRS to be unattainable, but have managed to keep it every month by a slim margin. To do this, I am essentially on the phone with eBay every single day for defect-removal and I am constantly having to probe buyers for information that would allow me to demonstrate to CS that their claims are bogus. 

Approximately 70% of my INAD defects are buyer's remorse, without these my actual defect rate is around 0.6%. I can tell you without a doubt that the original intention of the defect system was to get that 20% discount back.

The tracking shows that the item was delivered.  When I look at the USPS claim form online, there is an option to select the mailer or receiver of the package as the one filling out the form.


Who is responsible for filling out this form?   As the seller, I think I'm covered under seller protection, since the item was delivered on the tracking page.

Ebay,Do sellers usually get offended if buyer gives neutral/poor feedback without communicating with the seller nor asking for a refund?,"I've been using ebay for years and only once have I given neutral feedback and it was because the seller shipped a collectors edition item in its original box (which wasn't supported on the inside) wrapped in brown paper and arrived with the box crushed but the product still in working condition. I left the feedback explaining what happened but didn't ask for a refund or anything because I could live without keeping the box in pristine shape and the seller flipped out on me over messages, something like, ""Why should it matter if the box is crushed so long as the contents made it??!!"" among other things that showed he didn't get it.

Anyway, I recently bought a video game described as good and ""good disc condition, only a few surface scratches, plays perfectly"". Got the item and the disc should have been rated as acceptable because it was one of the poorest looking discs that I've ever seen. I would have written, ""many many scratches"" not ""a few."" Seller doesn't accept refunds and I haven't tested the disc yet to see if it actually works (left home after it arrived) but I probably won't file a claim unless it actually doesn't work. I ordered two other games from the same seller that were described as ""very good"" but I would probably have rated them as ""good"" though the quality is far better than the first disc and the descriptions more accurate. If the games work I'll rate these positive because the seller refunded some of my shipping since they shipped together.

My question is, should I contact the seller at all before leaving my feedback as neutral? I don't really have anything to say to them unless I'm seeking a refund for a non working disc but I would like to avoid getting harassed by another seller who's upset about their feedback percentage.

Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone. I really do mean it. Sorry if I offended the sellers here but I really did want to know how to deal with it.

Ebay,"Feedback for item not received ""on time""?","Hey, I'm just looking for some advice and thought maybe you guys could help out. I tried to google this without much success.

I bought an item on 8/7 with an 'estimated delivery date' of 8/13. Seller messaged me on 8/10 saying she was having trouble with printing a shipping label and asked if I wanted to wait for that to work or if I'd be okay with first-class mail &amp; no tracking. I said the latter would be fine and I received the item today (8/14).

I went to give feedback and anticipated giving ~~4~~ 5 stars for everything, but I'm wary of the ""Did item arrive by or before Thursday August 13th?"" question. I'm 100% not upset at all about it being one day late, especially since she kept me in the loop about it. Admittedly, I have wondered if she was just feeding me a line about the labels, but even so, I'm not upset about that enough to want to screw anyone over. She's an unexperienced seller who currently has 100% feedback. 

So my question is, how does a ""no"" to that question affect the seller? Does it factor into overall feedback score? I only have a rudimentary understanding of the eBay feedback scoring, but I work retail so I understand that 'customer survey' BS where anything less than a perfect score = failing. So if saying 'no' is gonna majorly dick her over, I'd rather avoid that.

Ebay,Buyer Wants to Return Item a Month Later,"Hi Reddit,

I'm in a delima right now. A buyer of mine wants to return a bad ESN phone that he purchased from me. In the listing title I wrote ""see notes"" and I explained that the phone has a bad esn.

Ebay,I live in the UK. Buying a laptop from US with GSP shipping... I'm confused!,"So I'm looking at a laptop on eBay to purchase that is in the US. I live in the UK, so I know that I have various fees I'll have to pay such as customs, taxes, VAT and so on. However, I'm a bit confused. The item's page says that it is sent using the Global Shipping Programme, which is going to cost around $70/£40.  (http://puu.sh/jF2QZ/9c87a7376d.png)  
When I hover over the question mark, it tells me that this fee will cover ""...applicable customs duties, taxes, brokerage and other fees. This amount is subject to change until you make payment.""  
Does that mean it will cover all import taxes/customs fees/etc? Or will I still have to pay money on delivery? The ""Learn More"" page tells me that those fees are in *addition* to any country import taxes? http://puu.sh/jF3kF/180e5ce1d9.png  
So I'm being told that I won't have to pay any money on delivery, and then that I will have to?

Ebay,"eBay allows buyers to ""opt out"" of Global Shipping Program after the sale.","I only ship through Global Shipping Program. I make sure the ""no alternative international shipping"" drop down is selected.

So, about an hour ago, I had a buyer do a BIN on some laptop parts I have for sale. I had un-selected the ""immediate payment required"" while posting an auction and didn't re-check it when posting this.

A minute later the buyer requests a total. He is in Zimbabwe. I'm not even going to attempt to send three laptops (for parts) to Zimbabwe.

But I can't figure out how he purchased them. I specifically exclude shipping to anywhere outside the US.

So, I called eBay support. The SC rep explained to me that if the buyer doesn't want to use GSP, he can request a total for the sale and that will opt him out of GPS.

I couldn't believe that eBay allows buyers to ""opt out"" of the GPS after the purchase and then expect me to complete the sale. How can that make any sense? 

So I asked for a supervisor and was told the same thing. 

So, buyers can ""opt out"" of the GPS, after the purchase, if they think the charges are too high and ask you to send the item through other means. If I specifically state on my auction that I don't want to ship internationally, how can this be allowed by eBay?",5,3,2015-08-17,EBAY,0.020809315145015717,0.931826651096344,0.047364093363285065

Ebay,Scam? Buyer returned an item with tracking but it never showed up (xpost /r/scams),"Thought I'd post here as well. The helpful folks over at /r/scams are saying to not refund until I have the package.

I'm the seller, I sold an item ($200) on ebay. I agreed to a return (even though the listing indicated no returns). The buyer sent me a tracking number which says it has been delivered (by USPS) to my zip code. However, the item never arrived. I asked for a copy of the mailing label or something with the address on it, but all they have is a copy of the receipt (tracking number no address). 

It's possible that the item was swiped from my address, but that would be pretty rare at my house/neighborhood. I've read that some ebay scams happen when the seller does this to the buyer (they just get a tracking number for an empty package to an address, like a library or something in the same zip code), but not the other way around.

Ebay,Bought a faulty laptop from a nightmare seller; eBay not helping at all,"I purchased a laptop from eBay and the seller said they were not receiving my fees via PayPal and then refused to dispatch, even though they had already marked it as dispatched. A week passed, so I contacted eBay and PayPal who told me the funds had actually been received. I opened a PayPal case and she then revealed that she could not dispatch due to it not being ready. 

I then received the laptop and thus closed the PayPal case, but it  later began to malfunction. The seller accepted the return but didn't want to lose their eBay fees. I tried to return through eBay, who then declined due to a case previously being opened and closed on PayPal. I then tried to open a dispute on PayPal, but I couldn't open a dispute because one was previously opened. I then contacted PayPal who said I would have to return it to her and then the seller would have to refund form her end. She said that was fine and that she would process the refund form her end over PayPal as soon as the laptop arrived.

I returned the laptop, and a week has passed, and she has not refunded due to her supposedly waiting for her eBay fees. I have contacted her asking why this effects the PayPal refund which she agreed in writing to do, but she just replied saying she's waiting for her eBay fees. I contacted eBay who said that if she refunds through her end, she will automatically get her fees back. I have told her this, but again, no reply yet.

A few days after the buyer's rambling, incoherant final message (as a response via the in-eBay mediating system), I checked the tracking (being doing it daily so they can't try to pull another type of fast one on me) and saw that the package had been signed for (earlier that day) by the buyer.

They have now closed the case... only after I sent a ""tracking shows package received, please close the case"" message.

Ugh. They should never have opened it in the first place. What a dipshit.

I hesitate to call this the final update because I have a nasty feeling they're going to pull a bullshit return request on me, but fingers crossed!

Ebay,"Item returned to seller due to address mistake, they refuse to refund me although admit they have it and Ebay won't help","I am really disappointed in Ebay and quite shocked at their attitude right now.

A few weeks ago I bought a cable for a small amount - £3. I entered my work address but left off which floor it was (my mistake). The postman gave up easily and returned it to the sender. The sender is a small commercial ebay store selling new goods, not an individual. They have a red star, which I assume is a good rating.

After a couple of weeks I realised I had not received it and requested a delivery update. The seller responded saying they had received it back straight away and had been ""meaning to get in touch"". They were immediately a bit defensive saying its the postal service's fault and they take no responsibility (actually its more my fault but whatever). 

Anyway, we agreed I could get a refund for the item and not the postage, which seemed fair. They said ""Please close the request and we will refund you right away"". So I did close it. 

A couple of weeks later I noticed I still haven't received the refund. This was quite annoying so I emailed them and gave them a bad review on the basis they were unhelpful in communications, didn't tell me my item had been returned initially and didn't refund me when they said they would. 

They responded with a bizarre email saying something like ""You were supposed to send the item back before we refund you, you should learn some patience. Now you get nothing since you negged us."" I responded reminding them of what actually happened and emailed ebay customer services to see how I can go about getting my refund. 

They quickly remembered the actual situation and said it was my fault for being impatient that I had not had the refund. After another exchange they came back and said if I removed the review they would refund me afterwards. I responded that as I have been promised this before I don't trust them and I would consider removing the review after the refund (to be honest at this point I had no intention of removing the review considering how bad my experience had been). 

I complained to Ebay again and then eventually got a call from their customer services. This is the part that really surprises me and makes me think I wont use ebay again. They rep immediately opened with ""We have had a call from one of our top rated sellers!"" They then accurately repeated the exchanges (to their credit) and said they could process the refund at the same time as removing the review. I explained I was not going to remove the review and to blackmail me and withhold the refund I am owed is appalling. He seemed to very much take the seller's side and said there is nothing I can do to get my refund if I don't submit to the blackmail. 

After this long useless exchange where he kept going over the same story and I kept explaining I want my refund without removing the review we ended the call. I emailed the seller to say I still expected my refund or I would dispute it with paypal or even the small claims court here in the UK. They responded with an angry ranting email saying they are going to get my ebay account banned and they put me on a blacklist on the ebay sellers forum!

So now I wait for paypal to look at my claim, for £3, haha. 

I am writing this because I wanted opinions on whether I am being unreasonable or not. I really feel I am not and that ebay and the seller are, to the point of breaking the law. I know I am being comically stubborn (as is the incredibly rude and unprofessional  seller) but I don't respond kindly to threats. Also, what is the likely outcome of paypal dispute?

tldr; see title. Seller won't give refund unless I remove my negative review. Also threaten they are bad mouthing me in sellers forum.

Update: Victory! Ebay decided to reverse the decision after reviewing the case and said that since the seller told me I would be refunded after closing the case they would honour that. Before this happened though the seller had the cheek to provide a fake delivery tracking number to paypal. I am gobsmacked at how dishonest they are and have written to paypal pointing out it is fraudulent and has a delivery date to someone else after I raised the case.",19,7,2015-08-19,EBAY,0.1383613497018814,0.8326541781425476,0.0289844311773777

Ebay,Why is the selling interface so bad?,"Been selling on ebay for over 2 years, yadayada, they constantly change the website's layout and how things look.

But why is the current one so awful? Is there a way to change it back to the way it was? 

Previously, for the shipping portion, it was very easy. All of the shipping details were neatly organized together and I could select a service and see its price, change the weight, dimensions, and choose whether or not to ship internationally. 

Now those options range over 3 separate boxes and I can't even see how much each service costs.


I also can't see the ""similar items have sold for [x]"" for when I'm choosing a price for an item.

Ebay,My ebay account has been suspended one day after creating it ?!,"Hi all , 

So recently i've created a bank account and all that jazz since i've been working all summer. I also got a debit card. So i decided to create my own ebay account under my own name and card number (Used to use my moms card on her account)

I created the new account and linked my paypal and new card to it. I purchased two SSD'S which totalled like 260 euros and everything was good , payment was sucessful and goods were sent by the seller. 

Tonight i received and email from ebay saying my bid on the SSD which i purchased was deleted. Then quickly after I got an email saying my account was suspended. It read 

&gt; After reviewing your eBay account, recent activity has raised serious security concerns. As a result, we've taken the following action on your account:

You won't be able to use eBay in any way. This includes using another existing account or registering a new account. Any outstanding selling fees are due immediately, and any amounts that you haven't previously disputed will be charged to the billing method currently on file.

Ebay,Seller did not ship to GSP with reference number or eBay label,"I bid on a second hand mobile phone for several hundred dollars on 11/08/2015 (August 11, 2015) and won this auction. I sent payment immediately. The item is listed as eligible under the Global Shipping Program and I live in Hong Kong, so the item needs to be shipped there. My shipping address is my address in Hong Kong. The seller lives in the US in the EST timezone so I accept that there may be some delay in communication due to the time difference.

I end up having to wait one week before the seller even ships the item. He indicates that he had some family emergency, so I give him the benefit of the doubt.

Fast forward to 19/08, the item is listed as shipped on eBay and I receive an email to that effect. I have some back-and-forth with the seller and find that **he did not use the auto-generated shipping label from eBay nor did he write the order reference number on his shipping label on the package**. He states that he directly used the Kentucky address provided to him from PayPal. Note that I have no experience selling so I essentially am just guessing what may have happened at this point.

He tells me that he wished I had told him he needs to ship to Hong Kong and asks me if there is anything I can do to retrieve the package from the Kentucky address. He says that there is no way for him to get the package back now that it's been shipped. I tell him that the shipment was not handled correctly and he tells me that he handled it fine and that there was not enough information provided.

He seems to be nice, patient, and willing to resolve the issue throughout. We have since taken the conversation to email. Yesterday (21/08), he says he got in touch with PayPal and they said that they would know what to do. I asked him for further detail on how they would even identify the package and he tells me that he asked the same question and was assured that they have all the information they need and it would be resolved. I was not given any more detail, so I remain skeptical.

Now, I have told him that I will check in with him Friday night EST (now) and Monday night EST if the tracking info on eBay has not been updated. It has indeed not been updated so I will just wait until Monday night EST to check in again.

A few questions:

* *Am I wrong to not have specified that the item needs to be shipped to Hong Kong?* I have no knowledge of selling and as a buyer, I have provided my shipping address normally. I don't believe this to be any fault of mine. He is the seller who has marked the item eligible for GSP so he should be well-versed or at least familiar with the process.
* *Am I being scammed?* The seller has little (22) feedback but only one has been negative and it was only for poor communication and item was not as described. I did some research from his username and was able to cross reference his hobbies with items he sold so his account at least seems to be associated with his online identity. My intuition is not telling me that I'm being played, but I could be wrong. At the same time, I'm not sure anyone can tell me here if I am being scammed or not but would be happy to have some insight.
* *What should I do next?* I have asked him for a scan or photo of the receipt for the USPS shipping to the GSP warehouse (he previously said he'd be happy to send it to me). I sent that email this morning (EST) so he may have been busy or have plans this Friday evening. I am planning to wait until Monday evening to check in if the tracking info has been updated which should happen if GSP warehouse identifies the package correctly. I believe it's safe to assume that the package must arrive by the coming Monday if it was sent out on Tuesday.
* *Are there any steps I can take to protect myself in the event I need to open a dispute (if I am even in the right to do so)?*
* *If he cannot produce the receipt and the package has not arrived to the GSP warehouse by that point is it fair to assume either the package is lost or I'm being ripped off?*

Ebay,Weird eBay practices: scam or paranoia?,"I apologize in advance for verbosity, but the details might be important.

I purchased BIN three lots from a user for about $1500 total. (These are trading cards. I'm always careful because counterfeits are pervasive. Based on photos I'm confident these are not counterfeits.)

The user had about 150 positive feedback selling expensive items, but they were all about a year old.

The only weird thing about the lot was that it said it wouldn't ship for 21 days, because that's how long it would take PayPal payment to clear. (The mouse-over text said something about how the seller requested an extended S&amp;H time.) I know from selling myself that PayPal puts your first few sales on hold for ~21 days. I also found out that PayPal can reinstate that hold if you haven't sold anything for a while or are otherwise marked as a ""high-risk"" seller.

The 21 days is to ensure the buy gets their item. So waiting 21 days kinda defeats the purpose, but I'm not sure it matters because you have 45 days to make a PayPal claim, and eBay's 30 days starts after delivery.

I didn't mind waiting, so I bought the lot.

As I waited for a combined invoice, and before I had a chance to pay, I get an email notification that the listing had been removed. Since I didn't pay, the transaction was just cancelled. Had I paid, the listing was supposed to proceed as normal. So I wasn't sure if I was bummed or relieved I hadn't paid.

I messaged the user asking what was up, and no reply. (Though we had sent multiple messages in the mean time and he replied quickly.)

A day or two later I get an email from eBay (actually, about 7 copies of the same email) that has an ""MC010"" error and the following message:

""Our records show that you recently contacted or received messages from [seller username] through eBay's messaging system. This account was recently found to have been accessed by an unauthorized third party, who may have used the account in an attempt to defraud other members. 

We've taken action to restore this account to the original owner, but wanted to let you know to be suspicious of any communication you may have received from them. Nothing is wrong with your account at this time ? this message is just being sent as a precaution. If you have received any messages from that appears suspicious, please feel free to forward them to us at spoof@ebay.com for review.""

[Aside, what's with that weird ""...at this time ? this message is just..."" part??]

Since then, the user has changed their account name. eBay resent that same message with the new account name.

The seller got back to me a couple days later saying that eBay froze his account because he listed too many expensive items at once, and that he would relist those items in a few days.

Obviously, my question is: Should I be concerned about repurchasing those items? I would think that since eBay is already hovering over his account, they'd be more inclined to believe me in the case of a scam (empty package, counterfeits, etc.). But I could also see eBay saying that they ""warned me."" Any help appreciated. Thanks!",13,4,2015-08-22,EBAY,0.08619686216115952,0.8890302777290344,0.024772848933935165

Ebay,"Got scammed as a seller, what now?","Hi everyone, I got scammed today and I have no idea what to do next. 

My auction finished this morning and I see in my sell page that the buyer sent the payment. I checked the buyer's page real briefly, only 30 something transactions but 100% rating so without thinking twice I printed the shipping labels from ebay sent off my item. 

When I got back home today I noticed that ebay customerhelp sent me 12 warning messages about suspicious buyer and canceled the bid. So I quickly checked my ebay page and notice that the buyer deleted their account and no longer exist. Then I checked by auction and noticed that the payment was only confirmed by the buyer and never actually gone through.

I canceled the auction and contacted ebay support and they directed me to the [USPS Package Intercept](https://www.usps.com/manage/package-intercept.htm) page. And here is where the headache starts. While is the shipment associated with the tracking number is eligible for USPS Package Intercept the destination address confirmation page returns the same ""Package Intercept service not available at that location"" error no matter address what I put in. 

I proceed to spent the next few hours on the phone and USPS and ebay and no one seem to be able to know or know what to do. USPS representative suggested that ebay may have used another courier and cause an address mismatch on the Package Intercept website and said that they could not cancel the shipment over the phone. The ebay representative claims that the shipment is indeed done through USPS and they can't help me.

... what now?

Ebay,Technical Trouble Resulting in Incorrect Address - Help!,"I'm having some troubles with a recent purchase and as a relative noob to eBay, feedback would be appreciated. If anything important is missing I will edit to include those points. Here goes:

I recently purchased a manufacturer refurbished DSLR from a somewhat reputable company through their eBay storefront. As I had purchased from eBay in the past, during the checkout process there was a default address on file for my account. **On the final page before submission I deliberately changed this address to reflect my new living arrangements. After clicking submit, the confirmation page reflected the old address - still associated with the eBay account, but certainly different than that used on the order.**    

Immediately following the submission of this order (&lt;10 minutes later), I canceled the order and contacted the seller via eBay's messages informing them of the mistake. Additionally, the following morning I contacted their phone support number to inform them of the issue. During this phone conversation, I was told that the item was ""on the truck"" and there was no way to reroute the order, but they could have the package returned to the sender by the carrier to be processed for a refund. I agreed with this suggestion and waited a few days for the tracking number to reflect the changes discussed.    

After forgetting about it for a few days, I was notified on Saturday evening that the item in question was delivered to the old address and left immediately outside the garage. Initially, I thought this would be great news, but as I pulled up to the house to check (I now live around the corner), the package was nowhere to be found.    

I've now spoken to eBay a number of times. My most recent conversation ended with the customer service agent and her supervisor insisting that I open an INR against the seller. As this all started with what I believe to be an eBay issue, I don't want the seller to be held liable for what should be made right by eBay. As I was told that an INR is literally the only path forward, I reluctantly agreed to begin the process of contacting the seller.

**Additional notes:**

* To complete the transaction, I used a combination of eBay credit and PayPal (via credit card).
* The new residents of my old address said that they saw no packages over the weekend
* The sellers have agreed to give me the same price on the camera after processing the refund - not sure where this currently stands


**A few questions:**

* Am I missing something about the way that eBay handles delivery addresses? Is what happened during checkout an expected outcome?
* Without proof that I updated the address on my side before submission, am I screwed?    

**TL;DR:** Updated my address during checkout but it was not honored and item is now lost after attempts to cancel/reroute. A few questions directly above - any help, feedback, or constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: It is stated above that I only messaged the seller upon noticing the issue. At the same time, I also canceled the order officially.",6,4,2015-08-25,EBAY,0.1588597595691681,0.8165014982223511,0.02463873289525509

Ebay,Bidding early vs Sniping?,"Hi there,

I was discussing with a friend who is a big ebayer about when to bid on an item.

 I have always thought sniping your max bid at 3 seconds was the best way as eBay differs from an actual auction as there is a count down timer and then the auction ends.


My friend says bidding your max early is best as it deters others, how can this make sense as every time another eBayer bids the price increases purely because you bid your max?

Ebay,CANADA did not respond to USPS inquiry on a lost package. Is there anything more I can do besides file a claim?,"So, I sell a lot on eBay, and 2 months ago I sent a package Priority Mail International to a guy in Canada. Naturally, he says it never arrived, and USPS no longer has tracking for such packages, so I was out of luck. But, I submitted an inquiry, as I have heard stories in the past that if the package was actually delivered Canada would eventually send a letter back saying so.

Well, the timeline on the inquiry finally ran out and I got forwarded to claims. The letter accompanying the claims form says that ""The post service of CANADA has not responded to our inquiry."" This was not what I was expecting; I either wanted them to say yes it was delivered or not it was lost, but ""no response"" leaves me hanging.

Is there anything more I can do at this point except file a claim? Will Canada ever respond? Will I ever know? Is there any way to find out why Canada HASN'T responded? Will the package ever turn up?",16,5,2015-08-26,EBAY,0.03090718574821949,0.9111003279685974,0.057992491871118546

Ebay,How can I (seller) protect myself against a possible scam? (details inside),"Hello. Sorry for making another ""scam?!!!!!"" post haha.


--

Anyway:


I sold an item today (car part) for about $50.
The item wasn't paid directly by Paypal. 

 He sent me after a message to my PERSONAL email (how the heck did he find it?!) asking me to ship the item as fast as possible because he needs it ""*before the 02/09/2015 because we flight the 04/09/2015.*""

So I obviously didn't dispatch the package to his  address because I hadn't been paid yet.
But 15-20mins later the payment went through on Paypal. I checked, and it's there.


Now here are the weird details:

* why didn't he pay directly once he got the order?
* why did he send me an email instead of doing so through ebay's message system
* he wrote said email in ENGLISH when I'm French, and he obviously is french as well.
* I don't like the fact he pressures me to send the package so he gets it before his vacation or whatever.
* this is the email he sent me: he shows at the end the ebay order confirmation he has received (in English?!) which looks different [which looks different](http://i.imgur.com/7uENb6m.png) from what an [normal order confirmation looks like.](http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/4389/ebay2o.jpg)
* On Paypal (maybe I'm a little bit too paranoid), I can see I have received $50 but a piece of text is hidden from like a white box. Hard to describe, see the green arrow top right. [here](http://i.imgur.com/I86cbjP.png)


But, at the end of the day, he paid the order, so I HAVE to send the item. But how can I protect myself from a possible scam?



Also, he has 0 feedback.",1,4,2015-08-28,EBAY,0.030429648235440254,0.9284225702285767,0.04114778712391853
Ebay,seller wants more money to ship in a box,"After winning an auction with free shipping, I have been told by a seller that for him to ship the item in a box (rather than an envelope), I need to pay an additional $2.04.

I'm a fairly frequent buyer and I've never had a seller do this before. My first reflex was to just pay the additional $2, which I realize is pocket change. What's making me hesitate is that I find it somewhat underhanded to charge me extra when in my view the seller should have calculated all of this into the listing by either raising the minimum bid or not offering free shipping.

The item is small and delicate toy accessories - the combined weight is probably less than a pencil - but they are vintage, over 30 years old, and given the fragile nature of the plastic, I imagine that it would be beneficial to both parties that everything reach me undamaged. As such, I suggested (not demanded) that a cardboard box be used for shipping.

To complicate matters, I'm not even sure a 3"" x 3"" box would cost that much more than an envelope. If someone can contradict me, I'd appreciate it.

I figure I have three options at this point :

* have the vintage toy parts sent in an envelope and hope nothing arrives broken
* ask for a refund (I've already paid but the seller has not shipped since, obviously, I haven't paid the extra shipping charge yet)
* suck it up and pay the $2

If the seller had put $2 or $3 (or whatever) as the shipping on the auction, I wouldn't think twice about paying, obviously. It's the fact that he's asking for more money after the fact for something (protection of the fragile items during shipping) which I think should be a given, that irks me.

What would you do if you were in my situation ?

Thank you again in advance.

EDIT :

Here is the chain of events :

* won auction, paid
* msged seller suggesting he ship in a box to avoid damage
* seller replied saying I would have to pay $2 extra to ship in a box

Ebay,Has anyone experienced this? (shipping address),So in the past I thought my account may have been hacked due to my primary shipping address being changed to someone's who lives in Rhode Island. I immediately fixed it and changed my password and checked nearly daily my account information just to make sure it didn't change again. I figured it must have been a weird fluke since I haven't had a problem since. Well it's been awhile since I bought anything off eBay and last week I bought something. Well lo and behold my address has been changed again to the same address and this person now has my item. I don't even know how or why this happening. My only possible explanation is that this person made an eBay account and entered the wrong phone number and somehow eBay keeps putting this person's address as my default shipping? That or I'm being hacked... I have no idea. But I'm kind of upset as I was really looking forward to this item. I'm not too concerned about getting my money back seeing as how both eBay and Paypal have my actual address registered with them with many things being sold from that address along with purchases sent to it.  I've found who I believe is the recipient of my item on FB and sent him a msg hoping I can get this resolved. Besides that has anyone else experienced their shipping address changing without their knowledge? I think eBay should send you an email notification when this sort of thing happens.

Ebay,What feedback percentage does a seller get stopped from selling,I recently purchased a phone from a seller on eBay and after winning I noticed he has 3 negative feedbacks all for cellphones in which he canceled the sale and refunded the buyer(assuming he didn't get price he expected) well I won a phone from him a few days ago and it hasn't been shipped and he hasn't responded to any of my messages. His feedback is 94.2% I'm just wondering at what point does eBay actually notice this as being an issue and stop him from selling?

Ebay,"Waited weeks for a refund on an item that never shipped, opened a claim, then seller shipped and ebay sided with seller.","Here's the long story. 

I was buying an item as a gift. Shortly after I purchased, the seller marked the item as shipped with a tracking number. I was contacted shortly after that that the seller did not have the item in stock and would I like a different color or wait till it was in stock. I said no please issue me a refund. They said yes and it would take some time to be posted. 

I wait a week. Still no refund. Contacted the seller and the blame it on ebay/paypal and they will look into it.

I wait another week. Contact the seller again and get pretty much the same response as last time.

By the third week it has passed the time that they're tracking number said it would be delivered so I am finally able to file a claim with ebay. No response from seller. Today I receive the item (3 days after I made the claim) because the seller shipped it with priority 2 day shipping. Ebay has sided with the seller, the seller still has my money, and I have an item that I don't need because it was originally supposed to be a gift.  

What can i do? I have been searching on ebay for my options and I can't find anything. Do I just ask for a return at this point? Can I report the seller? This seems to be an ongoing problem with them based on other peoples' recent reviews. I'm honestly afraid to ship the item back after all of this because I'm afraid they will just say they never received it and I will be out of my money and the item. The seller seems like they will do anything they can to not return my money.

Edit: I also left negative feedback for the seller and it was removed and was told, ""it's been removed from the seller's feedback profile because of a recent decision on the eBay Buyer Protection case.""

What is up with this??? Is there nothing I can do to warn other potential buyers? Does this seller just get to keep on screwing people?

I don't participate in the ebay global shipping program.  Is there any way for me to fulfill this sale &amp; protect myself from a scam?

I told the guy it sounded scammy, and so we skyped.  He showed me around his iPhone repair shop, outside and down the street, and his bedroom (in the back of the shop, as is common in SE Asia.)  He also showed me a sterling HS class ring he was wearing (clearly a girl's ring, with a faceted pink stone).  He also showed me a package from another eBay seller that he wasn't going to open, just return it.  Turns out, he never actually paid for it, and the seller shipped it anyway.  

So while the guy clearly doesn't really understand eBay or obligations to pay, he strikes me as extremely fine.  Kind of a huge dork, but fine.  At worst he doesn't pay &amp; I relist...

Ebay,"return request on an item marked ""no returns accepted""?","I sold a large tile mosaic medallion, marked ""no returns accepted."" When the buyer received the item they initiated a return request claiming the item arrived damaged.

1. How is it even possible for a buyer to request to return an item that has been listed as ""no returns accepted""? 

2. They sent pictures of the damage and it is pretty obvious that the damage was caused by the buyer picking the medallion up by the edges - the torn pieces are hand-shaped, and positioned where you would expect someone to place their hands when picking something like that up. The item was actually inspected by the UPS clerks before it shipped, and it was in the same shipping box that it arrived in from the manufacturer, so there's no way that kind of damage could have been caused during shipment. I suggested they file a claim with UPS anyway to collect the insurance I purchased on it. They chose instead to open a case with eBay, claiming it will cost them $85 to return ship it (again, I clearly indicated I DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS on this item), when it only cost me $35 to ship it via UPS to the buyer. eBay took a whopping 36 seconds to agree with the buyer and seize $85 from my PayPal account. 
3. What options do I have at this point? They're trying to return an item I don't accept returns on in order to get a refund for damage they caused themselves and I would not at all be surprised if I get a 36x36"" box full of charcoal briquettes in the mail marked with $30 postage.

Ebay,Anyone else had any problems with shipping charges; ebay under-charging buyers,"So, I'm fairly new to selling, but I have several listings for multiple units of hard drives. One of my earliest sales was for dozens of my units, and the summary showed that the guy got charged the shipping price of only one drive, even though he purchased over 30. Further breakdown showed that the shipping had been calculated properly, but that he got a discount for all but 5.95.
Because I am so new to selling, I was unsure if I had somehow screwed up my listing, so I called ebay customer service, and they couldn't explain it. The service rep said that I would have had to personally invoice the buyer and apply the discount. She said that she would report it to the technical team.   
I cancelled the sale and the next two sales were fine, but then I got a few more like that, with only one unit's worth of shipping on multiples. I let it go, because they were high-margin sales and I didn't want a lot of cancellations on my record.
I changed my shipping options to a higher range and it hasn't happened again, but now I have the hassle of issuing partial refunds about 75% of the time.
All my listings are Buy It Now with multiple units.  
Anyone else encountered this problem? I haven't used ebay as a buyer in over a decade, so I have no idea how it looks from the buyers' perspective; I can't tell if they are exploiting some kind of vulnerability or if ebay is dropping the ball somehow.",7,3,2015-08-30,EBAY,0.12707817554473877,0.8330331444740295,0.039888639003038406
Ebay,"Paid for priority shipping and am not getting it, can I do anything?","On the post itself, it says they were shipping through priority, and I even verified with the seller it was in fact the correct shipping method before I even bought the item. I paid $20 in shipping, but when the seller sent me the tracking number, it said it was being sent through library mail (media mail), which takes about a week if you're lucky. I did in fact only go with this seller because of this faster shipping option, and I needed it very soon, but I won't be expecting it until Thursday at the earliest. It's already been shipped, and the seller never posted the tracking number on ebay itself, most likely because it would have shown it was not being sent through priority mail. I even had to message the seller to get the number. Is there anything I can do as the package is already sent, but I paid for higher shipping where I would have been expecting a 2-3 day wait as opposed to an entire week? I've tried messaging the seller, but after they sent me the conformation number, he's been unresponsive to my messages when I brought up the shipping issue.",15,3,2015-08-30,EBAY,0.04247135668992996,0.9194738268852234,0.03805481642484665
Ebay,"Sold an airline voucher. Ebay removed my posting, but the buyer still sent payment. What will happen?","I sold an airline voucher to this person with 100% (446) so he seems pretty reputable.

Ebay later emailed me saying that my posting was removed because this was against the airline TOS. Not sure why it was removed as it was sold to this one guy.

Ebay,Item not sent after 75 days?,"Sorry. Noob question.
I bought a custom fire emblem Robin costume two and a half months back. (It's pretty detailed etc)

It's been past the estimated delivery date. I asked the seller about it and he wanted an extra time of three weeks. 

I've waited it out, but I'm really worried. Nothing has been sent yet, or an apology that it's been delayed etc. This is the largest purchase that I've made ever, and the seller is pretty trustworthy. But I'm really anxious.

Should I get eBay to refund my money or should I wait it out awhile longer before taking action? I'm kinda worried. (Does the 45 day buyer protection still work etc? Since it's not even sent?)

TLDR, Bought a custom item 75 days ago but it hasn't even been sent yet.",22,6,2015-08-31,EBAY,0.09252709895372391,0.8667629361152649,0.04070999473333359
Ebay,"Bought a fountain pen, seller refunded without explanation, and has relisted it for higher price. What to do?","crosspost to /r/fountainpens

I won an eBay auction for a black Sheaffer snorkel yesterday. There were 10 bids total, there was no reserve , and it ended at $32 dollars including shipping. Good deal. I immediately paid with PayPal and went to sleep.

This morning I woke up to an email with a 'the seller canceled your order'. No other communication from the seller at all, no note in the PayPal refund, no nothing. Reason given ""Out of stock or other"".

Except they have RELISTED the exact same pen (with the same pictures and the same description) for US $84.99 (which by the way definitely not a good deal).

What should I do now? I'm pretty sure this is against eBay policy, and think I should/want to report the seller (who at the moment still has a nice 100% feedback, since I haven't left any yet..but I also have a nice 100% feedback, and don't want to mess that up..).

Edit - Apparently my own feedback is safe, and /r/fountainpens recommends leaving negative feedback to the seller. (What should I write?).

Can I also report the relisted item to eBay?

By the way, I don't want this pen anymore, I don't trust the seller to actually ship it in working order - if at all.

UPDATE: called eBay and reported the seller. I consider this fixed. ( see more elaborate reply below. Typing on phone is a hassle ).",5,6,2015-08-31,EBAY,0.07967772334814072,0.8850777745246887,0.035244476050138474

Ebay,"Misspelled address, presumably a scam?","Looking for a little advice as a seller. I've listed a pc and accepted a best offer price. The buyer has paid via PayPal but I'm a little suspicious before posting. 

I'm planning on shipping via recorded courier, but the PayPal confirmed delivery address is misspelled, possibly on purpose. 

According to Google Maps, the street address should be 'Edison', the PayPal address states 'Adison'. Southall is spelt 'Southal', ~~also the street only appears to have even house numbers, the buyer has listed their house as an odd number~~ [EDIT: House no. does indeed exist]

Everything points to this becoming an 'item not received' scam, but wanted to see if anybody else had experienced something like this before?

I'm considering just refunding the buyer and saying spell your address correctly then pay again, but would I better calling the deal off entirely, is this a common eBay/PayPal scam?

Appreciate any thoughts.

Thanks for all the responses, I'm still slightly cautious but think I'll have to put my faith in seller protection and the signed for courier service. I'll post the outcome in a few days for anybody interested.
