Ebay,"No More ""Refund And Move On"". When You Are Right, Stand Your Ground And Fight It. Eventually It Will Make A Difference.","I just wanted to share a story about an issue I had and how ""refund and move on"" is not always the best policy, even when your case seems hopeless. I feel like as sellers, we need to do several things to protect ourselves, and that includes no more partial refunds to make problem buyers go away, no more instant refunds to avoid those scary negatives, and no more rolling over and dying when we are unfairly ruled against by eBay. 

The same way the buyers got their overzealous protection by raising a stink, I think we can do the same if we make it a big deal instead of just resigning ourselves to the fact that we are always going to lose. Long winded story time now.

I had a problem with selling a brand new factory sealed item. Buyer used it, decided they did not like it, requested a return under INAD.

I accepted the return because hey, factory defects CAN happen. When i got it back it worked just fine, other than the fact this was not something I could resell for anywhere near the value after it was opened due to the nature of the product and would be taking a loss of at least $120. This was buyer's remorse and they abused the return policy.

I called eBay customer service and the first person has my back, says I'm good and don't worry, we can escalate this case and have it worked out in your favor. Awesome. 

Next day, ""this case has been closed in the buyer's"" favor"". I lose my final value fee, I refund the person, I get a defect.

I call back and ask what happened and I am told by another rep that the buyer is allowed to open the packaging and use the item, and that because i accept returns, there is nothing they can do to help me. That's that.

I call back and get another rep who says the same thing, and when i explain the situation, they are very sorry but i am just out of luck. I ask about my seller protection and they inform me that i have all kinds of great protection because i can block people from buying from me after they rip me off, and because i can tell on them after the fact.

I call back AGAIN and get another rep that i explain the situation to, and they parrot the same thing, but go a step further. I ask them if i can get the buyer to admit that the item worked but that they changed their mind, could they reverse the decision, and they say no. I was told that the buyer could sign a statement saying they lied and i would still not get my money back, even if eBay punished them for abusing policy, they will not make me whole. This is just the cost of business that i should have considered when selling on eBay.

At this point I get in contact with eBay For Business on Facebook and send them another message. Prior I had contacted them about this before the case was decided, and was told i would have to wait and see. 

I was pretty pissed at this stage and defeated so i sent them a message along the lines of ""I have enjoyed selling on eBay, but I can't continue on a platform that will not protect me from unscrupulous buyers who abuse the system. Now I am out $250, lose my final value fee, and i get a defect after doing everything right"" 

In my message, i told them that i understand the cost of business, but that maybe eBay should pony up and pay the cost of doing business as well since I've given them so much money, and that as a company that relies on sellers, they should be ashamed for providing such a low level of support to us.

I was shocked to see that 15 minutes later i had a refund for the full sales amount out of eBay's pocket, my defect gone, and even my final value fee refunded. I don't know if they did it because it was the right thing to do, and they wanted to show us that they will protect us, or if they did it because i was bugging them and they wanted me to go away.

The lesson here is that instead of rolling over and just paying the cost of doing business, if you are right, it's worth fighting it instead of just moving on to get shafted another day.

Also, eBay For Business is awesome. When you have a problem, message them on Facebook and you will deal with 100 times less aggravation instead of dealing with phone reps who don't seem to have the same level of knowledge.",41,36.0,2017-10-01,EBAY,0.06709843873977661,0.9009884595870972,0.031913094222545624

Ebay,First time ebayer seller - need some help/advice please,"Hey everyone,

Based in Canada. I plan on starting to sell my comics, and as the local market isn't too booming, I plan on selling via eBay. I've never sold anything on eBay before, let alone ship within Canada/North America/Europe, etc. 

1) What is the best method to ship comic books (e.g. Canada Post, chit chat express, etc)? Preferably including tracking number

I just want to set a standard price for shipping regardless if I sell 1 comic book or multiple - just so that there isn't any confusion or problems. Never done this before, so any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Sorry if this has been posted about before or it's a dumb quesiton

Ebay,Buyer return nightmare,"Return was buyers remorse which is not covered under ebays return policy. Attempted to work with customer and became hostile and did not communicate with us.Tried helping customer with return but did not return item. My return policy clearly states in ebays section unopened and unused and buyer bays shipping. The product was opened and used. Contacted ebay several times for assistance and was met with aggression and deception.
Customers feedback was not an opinion it was a clear lie. I did everything right on my part and ebay has let me down once again. 

She refused to return the product because she did not want to pay the shipping.  I offered to have her return item through paypal so she would be reimbursed shipping and she refused that too. I contacted ebay and they said that I could do that. Was told the case would be automatically closed in our favor. Buyer abused buyer protection, abused returns, made unreasonable demands, did not return original item. Ebay made it very clear that every feedback left is opinion even when it is clearly a lie.  How do I protect my self from headaches like this?
This is what I have for the return policy can someone help me make it bullet proof.

Item must be unopened in original packaging. If the items are not as described, we will offer a Merchandise Credit. In most cases this will be minus shipping and eBay fees. By bidding you confirm that you agree to the terms and conditions of this sale

UPDATE: I first contacted CSR on Sep 15th and today the negative feedback was removed. I finally was able to make contact with a rational and reasonable CSR supervisor.

VOICEMAIL: I was able to actually go ahead and get that feedback removed for you. I listened to that call and there was some misinformation there. So the good news is we can take care of you. Traditionally  if your buyer does open a case or return. We should be advising you to accept it to avoid the defect and then we can take care of that return shipping cost on the back end. I believe very honestly that would have resolved the feedback issue because they were saying you weren't following through on that policy.

Does this mean that we as sellers are required to accept returns under buyers remorse no matter the circumstances even though ebays own policy says that buyers remorse is not covered under returns? Also if anyone has sudgestions of a better return policy on my half I am willing to listen. I want to honestly have good relationships with my buyers and help them when I can.",16,3.0,2017-10-01,EBAY,0.058876004070043564,0.9057413935661316,0.035382580012083054

Ebay,eBay Money Back Guarantee,"Hi,
About a month ago, I purchased an expensive mechanical keyboard listed as ""new"" with the stock pictures. The tracking told me the item had arrived on the 6th of September, however I was on a business trip until the 25th and didn't get around to looking at the keyboard until the 27th. When I had a look, the packaging had clearly been opened, and when I looked at the keyboard itself to check for any issues, there was a massive amount of dirt *under* the keycaps. This was a present for a friend, so I would want give it to him a new and sealed item, which is what I paid for. Anyway, I contacted him requesting a refund the same day (as at that point I would rather buy one from the offical store at the same price) - however he's been taking several days to reply and I don't think we'll reach a conclusion anytime soon. The issue is, the earliest I can contact eBay is the 6th October, exactly 30 days from when I recieved it - so I wanted to know:
1) If I were to make a claim, would it be justified? Would eBay be likely to give a refund?
2) Would the 6th October be too late to make a claim, would the 30 money back guarantee have run out?

tl;dr
I bought a keyboard listed as brand new, arrived on the 6th, but was on a buissness trip until the 25th, when I took a look the packaging was open and keyboard was dirty, contacted seller for refund on 27th, seller doesn't reply, the latest I can contact eBay is the 6th, exactly 30 days after recieving it: Is the Money Back Guarantee still valid?",7,3.0,2017-10-02,EBAY,0.035099614411592484,0.9312002062797546,0.03370014578104019
Ebay,Question regarding a buyer being a scammer,"Hello /r/ebay. i have a question regarding ebay and asking for advice. Im currently trying to sell an old phone (nexus 6P). I did a Buy Now option and after receiving a low-ball offer ($130) i declined it and then was almost immediately contacted and offered the full amount i was asking for. When i accepted the offer i did notice the account was no more than 3 hours old. Thought, ""hey, maybe its a coincidence. im not going to judge."" well my gut was correct and after sending the invoice to the seller they contacted my cell phone via text and asked the condition of the phone. told them it was in great condition and never left a case and has a screen protector too. they said sounds good! ill send the money in the morning, please send it for delivery first thing in the morning. Woke up and still no payment. Contacted them and said if no payment was received by noon, I'm relisting. they immediately replied that they were sending $100 into my paypal to send overnight to their ""partner"" and it was a different address listed than the one on their ebay account. 

my question is, after i reported them, i was told through ebay i cant list more than $500 or 10 items on ebay. I am not a business and in fact this is the first time trying to sell on ebay. ive always bought. Is there a way to remove this restriction without becoming a business? I cant provide a legal business name because im just a person trying to sell a cell. But now i cant post it on their site and i tried calling their 800 number but its just a robot saying, again, i cant post anything because it will exceed the $500 limit.

Not really sure where to go from here but i just want to sell this thing asap but dont want to lose all the money its worth. its seriously in excellent condition and i dont want to just throw it away for under $200.

Ebay,Bought something from the UK and DPD has the parcel. And... I received a mail saying that I changed the delivery date to the 3rd of October. But I never requested that.,"Hi

So on the DPD website i entered my parcel code. And there is: *03 Oct 2017 13:48 - Your parcel has been delivered and signed for by ""caps word""*.

On ebay there is the message saying i wanted to be delivered the 3rd. But like i said in the title I never requested that.

I'm supposed to receive the parcel on October 10th-12th.(edit)

On ebay: 

Status 1 *As requested, your parcel will now be delivered on Tue 03 October 2017*

Status 2 *Your parcel will be with you today*

Status 3 *Delivered to Processing Hub for international delivery*

And then nothing more on ebay. BUT, on DPD website, 5 hours after the message saying it has been delivered: *03 Oct 2017 13:48 - Your parcel has been delivered and signed for by ""caps word""*.  Note that ""For by"" isnt an error i made, its written like this on the status.

On ebay status it's not delivered yet.

Oh I just saw that there is ""Multiple Carriers"". Good point i think.

I paid with paypal.

What can i do, I know I have to wait, see what happens etc... But I searched for DPD company and omg, there is so much complaints about this company. I pretty scared of what will happen.

Scams are everywhere, and I think, If they stole me, I will not be able to do anything, because I'm a student. I have to get used to the idea that I got scammed, by a delivery company. 

I'm probably wrong and it's just another delivery company that got the parcel, but when I search the ""caps word"" written there is nothing interesting, beside facebook, twitter users.

So thanks for reading me, and thanks in advance for your help!

Ebay,Anyone ever successfully recovered funds from a Paypal/Ebay double refund?,"So the past few weeks have been kind of a nightmare. A buyer was unhappy with the laptop I sold him, so he filed a return. He filed one through Paypal that brought my Paypal balance negative as I had already withdrawn the funds, ten days having passed and me thinking he was happy. I paid the negative balance with my credit card and figured the nightmare was over, but it was just beginning.

Ebay then charged me for the refund AGAIN, I guess because he'd opened a case via Ebay too.

Ebay tells me to call Paypal. Paypal tells me to call Ebay. I had a woman from Paypal be extremely rude to me. I am just trying to recover the money from ONE of these charges so I'm not paying twice for the same refund. I opened a case and just got an email saying there was no double charge and the outcome wasn't in my favor.

When I get through this I am never doing business with Ebay again, whether or not I ever see that money again (and it's really looking like I might not).

I am unemployed and struggling at the moment, and sold the laptop to try and get by, instead I got a nightmare. 

Anyone else here dealt with a double refund double charged nightmare? What was the outcome? What can I do? Has anyone dealt with this and had things end well?",15,14.0,2017-10-05,EBAY,0.11572537571191788,0.855042576789856,0.02923201583325863

Ebay,Scam with confirmed address?,"Relatively long time ebayer here, but mostly for selling my own preowned electronics. I listed my laptop (MacBook) tonight, Buy It Now... 2 years old and asked for ~$900. It sold within a half hour and PayPal transaction came through.

PayPal address is a confirmed address, buyer is verified, transaction is eligible for seller’s protection. However the buyer’s listed email address and name is a older lady in Sacramento and part of her small foundation (for a friend with cancer?). The shipping name is Russian and address is in New Castle, Delaware. Googling finds no link between the buyers payment name and recipient address. Reverse searching the address and it is definitely a package forwarding company. 

What’s the best course of action here? On one hand this feels like a hijacked account, in which somehow the package forwarding address got confirmed, and there will likely be a dispute or chargeback. On the other hand, PayPal says this is eligible for sellers protection, address and payee are both confirmed/verified, and as long as I document with signature required delivery confirmation I should be safe. How should I be handling this?

Ebay,Guys need some help regarding the counterfeit item I got,"So I purchased a Galaxy S8 from eBay and it is clearly a fake chinese phone disguised to look like the S8 with packaging and other stuff. I got it 2 days back and immediately contacted the seller telling him that this is a fake and you are scamming people here. He tried to be a smartass and then replied back saying I'm the one who is scamming which doesn't even make sense. 
Also his replies are always in broken English, like completely broken. Then he later replied back again saying he will give the full refund and I just have to send the product back. 

I contacted eBay immediately and they told me to wait for few days (4 days from delivery I think) so they can step in and handle things. Now I know he is scammer, so I don't want to reship the product because there is a chance he might say he never got the product back or something and put the blame on me for some reason. I haven't replied back to him since and just waiting for eBay to step in.  Legally I can't ship a fake item in the mail either I think.

UPDATE: Thank you again for all of the informative replies and suggestions. I did speak with eBay customer Service and they suggested I contact the buyer and try to resolve the issue. I explained that I belive the phone was tampered with and that it no longer resides in this country, yet they will not take any action until October 12. So I have sent the following message to the buyer.

I find your claim that the phone turns off by itself, suspect. I had been using this phone for several months prior to listing it and had no issues whatsoever. Furthermore, it appears that you have tampered with the item by removing the battery.  It is my personal experience that the Apple Store does not disassemble or repair any phones at the Apple Store locations. What is the address of the Apple Store you took the phone to? Is there documentation from Apple that they indeed replaced the battery as you indicate an found the motherboard to have an issue? I can not consider any refund at this time until I can get the following information.

1.) Why did you take out the battery of the phone?
2.) Where is the phone right now, what country is the phone in?
3.) If the phone was taken to an Apple Store, which apple Store? What is their address and who was the Apple rep you spoke with? And some sort of tracking number for the troubleshooting or repair.

FINAL UPDATE: Thank you to all who posted. Shortly after I sent the above message. The buyer had closed the return request indicating that the refund had been received.

Ebay,"Buyer assumes I'm shill bidding, won't pay.","I'm not really asking for advice here, just ranting as this is one of many ridiculousness I had to go through with eBay as of late. 

..So minding my own business waking from a nap I got these messages from a buyer claiming I am shill bidding.. Keep in mind the item sold for $3 and shipping is $8.

""Hi dear , just to remind you its extremely suspicious that suddenly a bidder who's name a****a(0) suddenly bid from $1.9x jump to $3. I will email to eBay to investigate in this issue, I strongly suspect you are manipulate the bidding and price. I joined eBay more than 10 years. Non of the people will suddenly increase the price up so much. Further more the stranger newly bidder is a***a(0) meaning he didn't buy or sell anything before. You may continue to manipulate. Even I won it I will raise complain to eBay and ask for investigate. And I won't pay its obviously like you are manipulated the price! You may give negative feedback towards me and I will do so. Let's eBay investigate, thank you bro and good luck for your smart strategy. If its true I will advice you do adjust the price after that. It's not about the money issue my dear, this is a fair world don't play cheat and it's just a SMALL amount!!!!!!""



Followed right after with this message.




""I will wait for eBay to investigate only pay. It's just a small amount but this is unfair to me if it's truth. You may cancel the deal nor give negative feedback. And I will do so as I suspect, I wrote wrong bidder name in earlier message, no matter what the last bidder is (0) new account! Good luck and thank you !""

Am I the only one here that hasn't gone insane? So apparently Sherlock Holmes, ebay user for 10 years since 2011 is after me. The other bidder he assumes that is me only placed 1 bid by the way.

Ebay,"Scammed 230 dollars, anything I can do?","Hey Guys,

Was my first time using eBay, and was trying to sell a pair of shoes for $150.  People were doing offers, but they were simply to low because I really needed the money.  Anywho, one day someone messaged my account saying that they wanted to buy the shoes for a friend and would pay $80 for express international shipping to Nigeria.  

They then asked if I could do it via PayPal because eBay had no option to add more for shipping (that’s what they told me).  I said sure, did a money request however stupid me thought that the pending meant the money had been sent and it was just being transferred via PayPal with a slight delay.  

Anyways, it’s been 20 days, messaged PayPal about it and they said no money has been sent to my account.  Really annoyed as I put in extra money over the 80 that I already spent for express shipping.  Really needed this money to pay things off and I’m pretty screwed now.  

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this sort of post, don’t know where else to ask.  Is there anything that I can do to get the money back, any suggestions are very appreciated.  Sorry for long post, just really need some help right now.

Tldr:  Sent items, person never paid, lost 80+ dollars from shipping as well as 150 dollars for the shoes themselves.  Any suggestions to help get the money back is really appreciated.",33,6.0,2017-10-08,EBAY,0.044279441237449646,0.910938024520874,0.04478251188993454

Ebay,Have been selling an item on eBay for several years - they are suddenly asking for a bunch of info...,"Been selling an item off and on on eBay for several years.  Earlier this year I decided to try and sell this more regularly and bought a bunch of this item (through about 10 auctions) at low prices knowing I could resell it higher.

I was not listing any of these in both listings - if 50 pcs were for sale (40 individual, 10 as groups) none were listed both places.

My individual sales are doing much better than the group ones, so I was going to reduce the qty available in the group and increase the qty available as singles.  I successfully reduced the group qty available, but when I tried to increase the single qty available, I got the following:

Ebay,Multiple questions regarding buyers,"So a buyer issued a return 22 days after receiving the item, citing that the box had several punctures in it.

My concern is, what happens then? Do I contact ebay at that point? I've heard mixed responses about what happens, anywhere from ebay will close in my favor to ebay doesn't give a damn and will give the buyer an extension. 

Also, although the box is allegedly damaged, the contents were factory sealed in their bags when I shipped it. The pictures in the listing prove that. If he opened them, am I just SOL at that point?

Lastly, the unpaid item assistant. What are your thoughts? I feel like I would benefit from it purely because contacting buyers who don't pay and who don't reply to messages is really friggin annoying.

Now I was going to be stuck with a battery I did not need and would need to eat the cost or return it.(if possible)I was really pissed off at myself, since I gambled and lost.

This laptop has no other auctions up and was pretty rare to find one. The auction sold for $240 and was i7 model. My max was $235.

I want to precise that during the whole return process I followed Ebay's steps in the item page, and never got the option to add a tracking number, and I wouldnt even have known where to get it from, was it something that the seller should have provided, should I have just had a premonition to do it myself even though nowhere in the process Ebay told me anything about it?  
Now how will I know if the seller is trying to scam me out of my money and just say they didnt receive the item back?  
One thing that is probably important is that I didnt send the item myself through the postal service, but the seller paid and sent GLS to my home address to retrieve the package, and the GLS guy just took the package without saying nothing.  
I'm pretty sure that the label didnt have any tracking number on it, I cant check it because since I confirmed the item as shipped the label link completely disappeared from the item return page.  
I sent the item on the 4th, it hasnt been checked as delivered yet, but it could be due to the fact that I'm in italy and the seller is in spain.  
any help would be greatly appreciated, this whole thing is such a headache",22,4.0,2017-10-11,EBAY,0.05152473226189613,0.9134601950645447,0.03501512110233307

Ebay,Review on USPS Insurance for a high dollar item being sold through eBay.,"I just wanted to share my experience with everyone on having to try and cash in on the USPS insurance I posted for a $450 laptop that I sold on eBay, that ended up getting damaged in the mail.  So I am suppose to receive a check for the $450 but I went through a long process and feel like I got very lucky, I do not plan on getting insurance through the USPS on anything over $100 again.  Below is my story.


I sold a laptop for $450 on eBay to a longtime eBay'er with high feedback.  The item was shipped on 9/1 and arrived on 9/6.  The buyer opened a case for INAD and added pictures to the claim, so I filed a claim with USPS and submitted the pictures.  I then got a letter from the post office accounting branch on the 10th, the letter was dated the 7th.  It requested I bring the item and it's original packaging to a post office to be inspected within 20 days.  Now, this is frustrating because on the USPS Claim webpage it says 

'If you received something damaged, please hang onto the original packaging and the damaged item until your claim is settled. You may be asked to take them to your local Post Office™ for inspection later. Please do not reship the package.'

This is difficult because the buyer has no obligation to take the item and contents to the post office, but the post office specifically says do not reship the damaged item.  Luckily, I had a good honest buyer and they took the item and packaging contents to his local post office and provided me a receipt from them, this was on 9/19. 

Yesterday 10/11 I checked my claim and found out it was denied, the reason being that I took to long to respond to their request to bring the item in.  This was clearly not the case and I had proof so I put in a appeal online, uploading the receipt the buyer sent me that they got showing they turned in the laptop to their post office.  I got the letter on the 7th, and he turned it in on the 19th so I was well within the 20 days response time. With that being said, I did not have much faith in the online process so I went to my local post office and provided proof of everything, my insurance, the damage, when I filed the claim, when I received the letter requesting proof, and the receipt for when the laptop was turned in.  The clerk was clueless, telling me I had to have the buyer ship back the item.  Also to add, the buyer told me their post office tried to tell him the same thing and only after he continually question this did they go through the process and took the laptop in to review the damage.  So I got no help from the local post office and went home and called the USPS 1800 number, after being on hold for well over an hour I got the number to the Help Desk Accounting department.  Let me note that this number is not ANYWHERE on the USPS for claims purposes or any accounting purposes that I could find.  I suspect this is because they want to make this procedure as hard as possible.  So I call the # and am on hold for 30 minutes and finally get someone.  I ask them to review everything including the receipt I got from the buyer that showed they turned the laptop into the post office.  At first he tried giving me the run around saying their receipt was suspect because it wasn't stamped.  I kept pushing and they escalated the case to tier two level.

Got a call this morning and was informed I will be received payment in the mail.  So I did get my money back but WHAT A HASSLE.  Also, I was lucky enough to get an honest patient buyer that went out of his way to help me.  We all know how rare that is.  I'd say ship UPS or use the insurance offered via 3rd party through eBay.  Do not make the same mistake I did, I got extremely lucky but I'm betting 9 times out of 10 for items worth that much claims through USPS are denied.",33,16.0,2017-10-12,EBAY,0.03851863369345665,0.9216954112052917,0.03978591412305832

Ebay,Fraudulent Return?,"I don't sell on eBay often but I'm a law student and I had 8 LSAT books and a set of flash cards that I sold as a bundle.  The buyer is requesting a return claiming that all items associated with the ""Logic Games"" portion of the LSAT (there are 3 sections, and Logic Games are usually the one that people study the most...there's some diagramming to it, so those prep books are the most sought after) were missing.  I put all of the books in, triple checked, don't still have those two books.  

How does this usually work?  The person is clearly just trying to keep the most sought after books and return the others, I guess they decided they didn't want them.  The box did arrive with that post office tape on them, so I'm sure it was damaged but I seriously doubt that the two most expensive items in the package just happened to fall out.  

I sent it media mail, so has it been weighed along the way?  I didn't record myself packaging the item, but I definitely will in the future.  I'm hoping I can file a case for mail fraud as well at not have to pay to have only part of items in my package returned to me.  

Thanks.

Ebay,Chargeback via PayPal -- wtf??,"Buyer bought a 1 dollar item via E-bay (3.50 shipping) and then left feedback once it was received saying ""Awesome!""

Fast forward a day to 8/7, and a case has been opened on PayPal disputing a 43 dollar payment they made to me. Except... they only paid 4.50, and even PayPal is showing that 4.50 would be refunded if it was found in their favor.

Today I check it again, and PayPal tells me that they charged back their financial institution 43 dollars for my 4 dollar item. That's strange. Then, I look at their Ebay page, and find that they've received a bunch of negative reviews for things that they have sold but never shipped.

Is this textbook scammer? Should I be reporting them? Or do you think something else is going on that I should be talking to the buyer about?

Maybe via reporting fraud or a return and somehow getting the refund into something they can monetize. So does anyone know whats going on here?

Ebay,$1500 worth of items shipped. Package Damaged. Buyer submitted a claim with USPS. I'm concerned. HELP,"I insured the items. On the way to the buyer. They were damaged severely. I was in contact with the buyer throughout this process. I discussed my options with USPS. I spent over two days on the phone with EBay attempting to explain my situation, but for some reason they weren't understanding my situation.
 
Here's my concern. The buyer has filed a claim using the insurance that I paid for. I cannot file a claim with USPS. (I am currently locked out of being reimbursed because of this.) 
 
The little bit of information I was able to glean from EBay is that if the buyer files for the insurance. ($1500) which they will surely get. They have 30 days regardless of the outcome of the USPS investigation to file a REFUND for the money that they paid me. So basically they can walk away with a cool hard $1500 profit + the money they paid me for the items returned to their bank account. I walk away without my items. With no money. No ability to file a claim. EBay has stated they will side with the buyer.
 
What are my options?? I have asked the buyer to submit for a refund, but, all that does is give me back damaged items that I can do NOTHING with, and no option as they've used my insurance number to file a claim for the damaged items. What protections do I have? According to EBay they can turn around in a month after collecting a nice fat pay check from USPS and ask for a refund. Plus I'm pretty confident the graphics cards that I sent aren't DOA. So they'll more than likely re-sell them.

Ebay,Buyer trying to scam my GF with bait and switch return. How to deal with the issue?,"My girlfriend just sold a Tiffany bracelet that she received from an ex because she didn't like it and therefor never wore it. The eBay buyer ~~(who just so happens to sell jewelry through their account)~~ says that the item they received is not like new because it is tarnished and worn in several places. That is of course completely impossible as the bracelet had never been so much as tried on once or twice. The buyer sent pictures of an obviously different though identical item that had the damaged they described.

My GF contacted eBay and they said she must wait until the buyer files an official return request before they can investigate. Well that just happened this morning so we're in the beginning stages of this process.

My question is, has anyone else dealt with and resolved this sort of problem? My GF has never sold anything on there so she was an obvious easy target. Neither of us even considered the possibility of a scam like this so we didn't take a plethora of photos.

Ebay,"""Case suspended"": My Ebay return ordeal - Part 2","This is a follow-up post to [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/75rba4/no_tracking_number_for_return_am_i_screwed/).  
My case is now suspended by Ebay.  
*Quick recap of what happened since the last post*

Package was still like [this] (https://imgur.com/a/fdS50), but since the label was given to me through Ebay, as others here said, Ebay themselves were tracking the item, so I was still annoyed, but calm.  
I then contacted Ebay support, and explained it all to them: requested return, seller sent GLS to my home and the label through the return details page, gls guy came and there we were.  
I also asked them to clarify about tracking...should I have put a tracking number somewhere or does ebay manage that since the label was given to me through the page?  


Ebay support responded saying that I didnt get the option to insert a tracking # because the seller provided the label, and asked me to give them the GLS tracking #.  
This caught me by surprise because the GLS courier didn't give me any receipt **whatsoever** upon taking the package. I told them that. 

They responded telling me that the GLS tracking number was on the label (which was entirely in spanish, and had no barcode, so I'm not even sure of the veracity of that statement, but ok) and that it is needed to track the item by them.  
They told me to ask the seller for it so they could put it in their system.  


This was extremely weird, since it went against what many here told me, and basic logic as well: if the label is provided to me through the return details page, it means that the seller uploaded it to ebay, and ebay gave it to me. They **must** have it themselves.  


So, I wrote the seller, asked them to send me the label again, so I could check the tracking number. **Twice**.  
They said that I should have gotten a receipt from GLS, and to send it **to them** so they could track it.  


I went back and forth with ebay support, with them telling me that I should have gotten a receipt with the tracking # (**so is it the label that had the trackin # or the receipt??!?**) to no avail.  


I then decided to contact GLS support themselves and in the end I managed to get a tracking number for them, that although only shows movement of the package in my country, no international logs.  
I sent it to them yesterday and today I woke up to the case being suspended with ebay saying that they will ""make a decision"" in 48 hours and to an email telling me they suspended the case because ""it hasnt been 14 days yet"" and that they've checked the tracking and there has been no news in the last 12 days.  
I'm thinking that my money is good as gone, I have done nothing wrong, followed every instruction but ebay's site and support is dreadful.  
Even their messaging system is completely broken, with messages turning into walls of text of gibberish, and messages disappearing.  
Never again, only amazon and craigslist.

Ebay,Buyer returned item he claimed was faulty but it's not,"I sold someone a used dashcam about a month ago. A few weeks after they received it, he put in a return request saying that it is constantly restarting. I asked him for more details and he said that he upgraded the firmware using his own SD card (in the original listing I stated that firmware upgrades can't be done with the original SD card the camera came with otherwise it will get bricked which is a common problem with this camera). I tried to get him to reinstall the firmware but he said that the camera wouldn't turn on at all, so I gave him a return shipping label.

I got it back today, and with the original SD card, it starts up just fine and everything works. He also left some of his footage behind on the SD card before he upgraded the firmware and the camera appears to be functioning normally, so I guess his SD card isn't compatible with the camera. I guess I should have told him to try starting the camera up with the original SD card.

Now I'm just wondering what is the best way to deal with this? He didn't return the manual (can be found online), windshield mount + adhesive (~$20, the adhesive is not reusable) and some cable clips ($10-$15).

Ebay,"What do you think of eBay Authenticate? Free shipping to authenticator. They list it. The ship it. They take 20% of selling price, (No mention of other fees).","To avoid violating rule II here is the text of an October 16, 2017 post by verified eBay blogger Katie Hammel:

&gt; When buyers shop for a designer item, they want the best customer experience—and eBay wants to ensure it’s delivering. Today, we launched eBay Authenticate, a white glove authentication service designed to help eBay’s millions of active buyers shop with confidence.
&gt; 
&gt; eBay Authenticate will help sellers provide the best possible customer service, and arm their authenticated luxury item with an “Authentic” badge once the item passes inspection
&gt; 
&gt; Sellers who use eBay Authenticate will have their items vetted and inspected by a professional authenticator. The listing will indicate that the item is authentic—and backed by a 200% guarantee—which will help increase buyer confidence. For sellers, eBay Authenticate will provide protection, since eBay manages the fulfillment.
&gt; 
&gt; Here’s how it works:
&gt; 
&gt; Sellers opt in when they start listing an eligible item on eBay.
&gt; 
&gt; Sellers ship their item to experts for free (mail-in or drop-off at a participating FedEx Office).
&gt; 
&gt; Independent industry experts verify the item’s authenticity, then photograph and list it.
&gt; 
&gt; When the item sells, it is shipped to the buyer in luxe packaging with a card stating the item’s authenticity.
&gt; 
&gt; A 20% fee is deducted from the selling price, and the seller receives the remaining 80%. For a limited time (until January 31, 2018), sellers receive 90% of the selling price.
&gt; 
&gt; eBay Authenticate is powered by industry experts who verify each item’s authenticity using both the item’s digital fingerprint and a careful examination of the item.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; For now, eBay Authenticate is available only to select sellers of luxury handbags and wallets valued at $500+ from the following brands: Balenciaga, Burberry, Céline, Chanel, Christian Dior, Fendi, Goyard, Gucci, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Valentino. In the near future, we’ll expand to new categories and brands. For B2C sellers, more options will be available soon. 
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; eBay Authenticate was designed to increase buy-in and consumer trust in eBay purchases and give sellers greater confidence in selling luxury items. For sellers, it uncomplicates the process of selling a luxury item. The experts do all the work of verifying the item’s authenticity, listing it, and shipping it. Sellers get the boost of having their item authenticated by experts and backed by a 200% money-back guarantee. For buyers, it’s a no-brainer—they can shop with confidence knowing the item is authentic.",8,2.0,2017-10-18,EBAY,0.03414791822433472,0.9169496297836304,0.04890246316790581
Ebay,"Bought a fake watch that wasn't even a replica of the one being advertised, seller wants me to return the fake item, how should I proceed?","Hey there, I recently tried to buy a gold Casio A159WGEA-1 watch from Ebay thinking it was genuine. The seller sent me a watch different from the one used in their ad, it was a gold A158w model. The reason I think this watch is fake is because the A158w never came in gold to my knowledge, I can't find any pictures of a gold A158w on Google images or any watch stores selling digital Casios. 

Ideally I would like to just return the watch and get my money back+the cost of return shipping. What do you think I should do?

I included a side by side comparison of what the seller was advertising and what he actually sent me, you can see that the dials on the watches are different

Ebay,Possibly getting scammed,"Alright so I purchased a Laptop on October 2nd and now even to this day the 19th all the tracking says is ""Electronic information submitted by shipper"".

I've contacted the seller to see what's going on, the fellow responded that they would check it out as they brought in the Laptop for shipping. When I got a response back from that I was told that the place they took it to didn't tell them that they couldn't ship it from there then was forwarded to another location that can and that I would see an update in the tracking just after Thanksgiving.

At this moment I'll tell you it's through Canada Post.

So I got nervous not seeing any updates so I called Canada post myself to inquire, got a spiel about having to get the shipper to launch an investigation so I did that and they apparently launched one. 

It's been almost a week since then and I feel like I should mark that the Item never came either a Week to the day of the Apparent investigation starting or the day after that and tell the seller that if the item actually comes I'll gladly pay them for it.

The seller has been in very quick contact with me, perhaps to keep me waiting longer to walk away with the money.

I'm just pretty mad right now and looking for other people thoughts on the situation. I obviously don't want to loose about $400 and I'm hoping Ebay will have my back on this.

Ebay,I had an... interesting interaction with a buyer.,"So I sold my Nvidia Shield Tablet on eBay. I packed it up well and sent it out, as usual. Then I received a return request claiming it wouldn't turn on or charge. So I got it sent back to me and said I'd give a full refund, including shipping both ways. I wasn't happy about this, but what else was I going to do?

It came in the mail and the retail box had a sticky substance on it. Odd. Then I went ahead and left it to charge. I got it to turn on after a while (even though the button was now loose and appeared to have teeth marks). It had been customized by the buyer (which meant they were lying) to the point of being rooted. Not something they could have done if it didn't charge. Eventually it completely stopped working.

I opened a case with eBay, providing evidence of this, and they decided to let me keep the money. But they also let the buyer have a refund as well. I was pretty neutral about this, since I hadn't lost anything in the deal.

Until I noticed that the tablet was expanding. What you may not know about this tablet is that it was recalled for battery issues (less severe than the Note 7, but similar). There are two battery types: Y01 and B01.

Ebay,Scammed by Buyer,"Hello everybody,

So I am relatively new to eBay and I started selling items in the beginning of the year. Eventually I decided to sell my PS3 console. The item was bought a few days later, but the payment was still pending on PayPal.

I decided to try to wait until the payment goes through on PayPal, and I found out that since I’m a new user, large payments pend until shipped and gets Feedback. Considering that I shipped the item a few days later

About a week passed by and the payment was canceled. I called PayPal customer service and I talked to a really chill person who understood what happened, reported the user, and promised that I’ll get a voucher to use in the next month via email. I waited a couple of weeks and I never got it. I called them again and a different person explained to me how I messed up and should have called them before shipping the item. At this point I knew I screwed up and accepted it. I take full responsibility for being a complete idiot and I understand that I’m probably not going to get my 130$ back, but I just want to know if I can do anything else. I definitely learned my lesson, but I’m still wondering if I can salvage something from this situation.",9,7.0,2017-10-22,EBAY,0.05328609421849251,0.897526741027832,0.04918713867664337
Ebay,Approved return but buyer wants more $ to purchase new shipping supplies,"I sold a paperback book to a buyer on eBay, $10, free shipping via USPS first class mail. I wrapped the book itself in bubble wrap and taped it shut and put it inside a large bubble wrap envelope, putting two piece of cardboard on each side so it didn’t get bent. The day the book was delivered the buyer opened a return requesting for arriving damaged. They said the outer envelope got wet and leaked into the envelope, getting the book wet. 

Sounded a little far fetched that water could have gotten through all those bubble wrappings but oh well. I approved the return and sent a return shipping label via eBay to the buyer. The buyer then sent me a message stating the envelope couldn’t be reused and they shouldn’t have to buy a new one. Fair enough, but now my hinky meter is being raised a bit more. I replied that I understood where they are coming from and asked if they could please provide me some pictures of the packaging to basically see how bad it is. If a book is wet, it’s worthless anyway so if there’s just a tear, they can tape it up. I do know that they aren’t required to send pictures (based on a fraudulent return someone tried to pull on me - when I asked him to send photos so I could do a usps claim, he did not have a camera or know of anyone who did). And guess what. This buyer also doesn’t have the capability to take pictures and states she “is happy to send this back once the envelope issue is taken care of or course:)”

I feel like someone’s fishing for a partial refund and I am not going to do it. I’ll lose money on the sale before I do. However I do have some questions. Besides paying the shipping costs themselves, do sellers have to pay for new packaging too? And how would we do that if we chose to? If I don’t do anything extra for the new packaging, can she still escalate this to eBay even though I’ve accepted the return?",11,5.0,2017-10-22,EBAY,0.03537715971469879,0.9199909567832947,0.044631894677877426
Ebay,Forwarding service scam?,"Buyer raised several red flags. The main one being requesting the item shipped to the forwarding service OIA GLOBAL: Bybee Warehouse (they just included the address, I had to Google the address to see the warehouse name). This is apparently a forwarding service for Australia/New Zealand, however the buyer is from India. Secondly, Googling the warehouse revealed a plethora of scam incidents via Google reviews, Yelp reviews, etc. Thirdly, they are buying a cellular Apple Watch which is designed to be used in the US and Canada. I've reported them through eBay and PayPal, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. The buyer has paid, but I haven't shipped the watch yet and I'm not sure I should cancel the sale yet before hearing back from eBay (I've heard this can ding your seller account?). Any experience/advice would be nice.  

EDIT: So after doing my research and reading the comments here I decided to message the buyer, and reassure that he's okay with not being able to use the full functionality of the product. He replied saying yes and that he thinks it will work in his country in the future. Ok, fine, he's wrong, but I'm not going to argue with him and I agree to ship the next day (today). Then a couple hours later he messages me and says on second thought maybe it wont work and asks me to cancel the order. Now I get why I see ""serious bidders only"" all the time in people's descriptions...  

Edit 2: Also since no one was able to provide me with any info on how to cancel an order without getting dinged, I figured I'd put the answer. As long as the buyer has a agreed to the cancellation in your messages, you don't get dinged for cancelling.",16,5.0,2017-10-22,EBAY,0.07957231253385544,0.8903636336326599,0.03006407618522644

Ebay,"Selling items below $1000, can I turn OFF immediate payment?","As per the title. I frequently sell items that buyers have questions about that requires me to physically have the item unpackaged. So, I generally list items with a rough estimate shipping cost, and it usually works out just fine.  

For some distant international destinations, the cost doesn't line up properly, and I have to contact the buyer and explain the situation, and work out an additional payment from them to cover the change in shipping cost. I don't want to overestimate the shipping based off these distant locations, because it will scare off those located physically closer where the shipping would be less than half of what I out up there.  

What I *thought* I was able to do was invoice the buyer *post*-sale and calculate the shipping to their address. It seems eBay requires immediate payment on items below $1000, which means I can't actually do this as the buyer has to pay first.  

Is there any way to turn OFF immediate payment for items below $1000?

Ebay,UPDATE and help requested! - Approved return but buyer wants more $ to purchase new shipping supplies,"Here’s the original post :

https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/77y76g/approved_return_but_buyer_wants_more_to_purchase/

Long story short, a buyer opened a return on a book last week stating the package and the book inside got wet. Book was wrapped and taped in bubble wrap, then put in bubble envelope. I was skeptical that it actually got wet but on Friday I approved the return and sent an eBay shipping label. They then messaged me stating that they don’t feel they should have to pay for a new envelope, basically asking for more money (hate to sound cynical, but possibly hoping for a partial refund, me just to cut my losses I guess). I messaged back stating that I understood and asked if they could send me photos of the book and packaging. They responded that they do not have a camera. I didn’t respond after that because it is not my responsibility to buy a $1 envelope, especially since I feel I might be getting scammed. Already approving the return and the return shipping label made this a loss for me (even without the book being wet) and I do not feel there is anything more I need to do. Since the return was approved on Friday evening, they would have til this Friday to ship the book back.
 
Just now I received an email from EBay stating the seller’s case has been closed because they opened a case with PayPal and got a second email right after that from PayPal stating a case had been opened.  This was the reason from the buyer:
 
“The item arrived wet - and the package was wet. For some reason, the seller has not responded to my message on eBay. I need compensation for shipping - it isn't fair to ask me to pay for shipping a damaged item back to the seller but I definitely do not want to keep a wet and ruined paperback.”

Ebay,"Pro Tip: If you're just starting out looking to increase transactions and / or feedback, the sports trading card community leaves feedback at nearly a 100% rate.","I've doubled the amount of positive feedbacks I usually gets each month because I've put more of the sports cards I've collected over the years onto eBay. Tons of listings for $.99 + $2.99 shipping and you'll still come out with a $.60 cent profit.

Every single sale I've had for sports cards has resulted in a positive feedback and it's usually the day that the shipment is received.

I only get positive feedback on the other items I sell at a rate of 33%, but with sports cards there is an emotional value tied to the card they're receiving and they understand how important feedback is.

The eBay community for sports cards is stupidly strong which stems from the early 2000s when some of the larger sports trading card forums (Sports Card Sherrif, Trader's Retreat) specifically added in an eBay-like feedback feature to their site so that users simply trading cards through the mail could gain a reputation as being reliable.

Ebay,Strange First Time Seller,"Found a seller who just created an account this year, was only selling one product, and had 0 reviews. Decided to purchase from them anyway since they're the only one with the thing I wanted and hey, we all start somewhere, right? 

Asked a seller if they had a particular item in stock since they didn't provide a choice at all when purchasing besides ""buy it now"" and ""best offer"" on a photo of multiple options with no way to know which one you're getting.

They messaged back quickly saying they did  have it and that it was okay to request it.

I decided to put in an offer since the best offer function was there. They respond back that the ""price is firm"" pretty much immediately. So I figure it's only there for me to request the one I want. I do that, offering the full amount requested. They take hours to accept the offer they wanted, but eventually they do.

I then pay via PayPal.
Not too long after I pay they send me a message saying the item I requested isn't in stock and that they've sent me a refund.

&gt;Hopefully the remote erase works and there is not too much of a wait

I've already paid via PayPal. My concern is that, if I receive it, end up having to send it back, I likely wouldn't be covered by PayPals buyer protection, would I? If he just claims he never received the item when I return it, there's no guarantee I'll get reimbursed, as far as I can tell? I can't tell if this is legitimate or not.

I should point out I've not used eBay before, and I also am not all that up on phones. How should I proceed? Best to just erase it myself, if possible? I'm hesitant to send it back without reimbursement of the money I already paid. Being unfamiliar with eBay I'm a bit concerned

Ebay,"Purchased an item, listing said it was complete, seller told me it was complete - it arrived missing parts. What can I do?","So basically, 

My girlfriend and I purchased a collection of stuff for a board game from a seller. The listing said it was complete (minus 2 specific things we didn't need), and I even messaged them to confirm that it included x, y, z and was only missing the 2 things mentioned. They said that was correct, I purchased, etc.. 

It arrived and I spent about 4 hours going through every single card/piece to make sure everything was there. Double, triple checking. 

There's a decent amount of parts missing that I looked up to purchase on their own, and it will cost me around 38 dollars. 

I messaged the seller letting him know the parts that were missing, and asked if they could check for them and mail them out to me - and if they could not find them, if they could refund me for the cost of the missing parts. He said he couldn't find all of the parts (he found the cheapest one, some cardboard pieces - and said he'd mail them out sometime next week?).. and he said he won't refund me. 

What can I do? 

We would prefer not to do a full refund, frankly because we've spent 7 hours or so sorting through and organizing everything and trying to find all this stuff together as a lot is hard enough as it is. 

I feel like asking for compensation for the parts that were missing, that he assured me were there, is fair. 

Are my only options return the item or eat the 40 bucks? 

I guess it would be one thing if it was an item we could just open an instantly see something was wrong - but we spent a long time organizing, putting our own protective sleeves and stuff on the card pieces, putting them in order to count and make sure everything was there, etc.... so we'd rather not have to take everything back off, box it up, and return it. That almost feels like a defeat since we've spent so many hours on it already, and would spend more laboring. It would probably cost me more money to undo the process and box everything back up than the 38 dollars... 

Basically, we do want the item - but we wanted and expected it to be as listed.

Is there anything I can do or am I just screwed because the seller listed something as complete and sent it to me incomplete? Are my only options returning for a full refund?

Thanks

EDIT: After speaking with the seller more, he says that if I wait a couple of weeks he will buy the missing parts and ship them to me.. ? That seems kind of fishy. Is there a time limit on making claims? 

Also, I don't see why he wants me to wait - he has my money from the initial transaction, so it's not like he needs to wait for a pay day.

Ebay,Purchased an item and received a defect version of it,"Purchased a collectible off ebay about a month ago(Frieza from Dragon Ball, with a stand). Seller is somewhat new but It's a good price and the item had multiple pictures. It looked really good. 

I received the item 2 days ago, opened it up and saw there was chip damage on the leg, the paint smeared onto other parts, scratches all over, some pen marks, weird gaps in the paint job and the face was printed lower than it should be. The item was listed(Still is) as ""New condition"". 

I got in contact with the seller, who offered me a partial refund and told me I could keep it and kept asking for a positive review. I asked them why they'd ship items without checking them first(The defects are very obvious) &amp; got a generic reply, again, offering a partial refund &amp; informing me that their staff is ""a newer"". 

I've given them Negative feedback on this now. Offering me a partial refund &amp; excuses is somewhat insulting to me.  I feel the proper response would have been to find a replacement that isn't a defect(If they even carry them and aren't just trying to sell defects  for quick cash) or a full refund/return.(I really don't want to ship something to China for a refund, especially when the total costs for me were under $20.)  

I'm more bummed about how I could have ordered from someone else and had a Frieza collectible that's worth having by now.

So 2 weeks ago I ordered a hoodie from China.  Seller has 100% positive feedback. Posts the next day. When I look they've since added postage costs to the listing. The photo of the hoodie is badly edited in paint like they have covered up someone's logo. 

They gave a yanwen tracking number and whenever I look it just says 'information created by seller ' or 'package information handed over '. I message them saying tjat it is not updating and it is okay if they have not actually posted. They tell me they will contact the post office to see what is happening. 

Next day comes and they tell me it is still there and delayed. My expected delivery date was 26 Oct - 13 Nov. Now they say it usually needs 7-19 days but needs 15-30 as it has been delayed by up to 10 days. 

Now I'm starting to get suspcious. I've had things come from China in a week despite saying longer, but no progress in 14 ?

He didn't want a full refund (including shipping). To revise his negative feedback, I had to find another one of the specific obscure antique musical items that he'd bought, that works well.

Ebay,Battery Issues and a Tale of Woe,"Just a little vent:

Recently found an amazingly good deal on a lot of sealed name-brand electronics from a retail store.  Factory sealed.  I've been selling similar products for a long time and we source from this big box store on the regular, so we probably hit 20-30 stores in a multi-state region to gather the item because it was amazing ROI.  They sold for way, way over what we expected, and quickly.  It was great.

Until the returns hit.

About three days after we started selling them, we started getting returns opened stating the batteries wouldn't work.  Keep in mind - sealed, name brand products.  A name I totally trust from personal/office use.  Three returns the first day, four the next.  At that point, we pulled the listings, opened all of the ones we had left, and found out that about 80% of them were completely DOA.  Brand new, never been tampered with, not old enough for it to make sense, but here we were.

We sold probably 40 of the item over the 4-5 days the item was up.  We've gotten returns on about half of those stating DOA, a couple of which never returned them (so we've got that going for us, which is nice) but holy crap we ate our hat on this flip.  It's the first time it's happened on eBay in our successful three years of selling there, and I am so effing thankful that defective returns no longer kill the seller, just their bank account.

On another good note, the big box store has a pretty iron clad 1 year guarantee on their items and we know most of the staff, so we should be able to at the very least get our money back (and at best, exchanged for the most recent item since they were truly DOA).

Ebay,"How would you deal with this? (""2TB"" flash storage scam)","I was looking for a 16GB flash drive and on choosing to order results from least to most expensive, I came across a listing for a 2TB USB flash drive. I'm embarrassed to say it did not occur to me that it was too good to be true. I've been buying a lot of cheap things from China and while I normally do not buy electronics from eBay I made the mistake as not thinking of an unpowered storage device as ""electronics"" *facepalm*.

I've been a buyer for 10 years and am careful to try to avoid scams but I just failed to realise that this was unlikely. I only paid 10-11 euro for it, but as I am a student this is not small change to me.

The item has not arrived yet - estimated date was only this Fri past - but I learned of the scam when I was telling someone about it and they were sceptical and directed me to some information about this scam (using flash storage that would otherwise be disposed of, spoofing the info on the controller so that windows sees an 8-32gb flash drive as containing anywhere from 512GB-2TB, and selling it, in a new casing, to someone who is poorly informed or gullible).

The vendor of course has a setup such that you can get an exchange for a faulty item. There are a good few scammers selling these. Some might offer a refund, but the customer has to pay return postage to China and the cost of doing so (you need to send it registered so that you have proof you returned it) would almost negate any refund and looking for an exchange is only spending more money to replace junk with junk.

If it doesn't arrive I can open an item never arrived dispute and hopefully get my money back.

I am a little surprised that eBay allows this to go on and forced people to send junk back to scammers by registered mail if they want a refund (eBay/PayPal).

How would you handle it?


Not only that. I ordered a 128GB generic microSD from the UK and now I am seeing that they have feedback where people say the listing is the same fake capacity scam. I paid the same amount and it is a generic model so it seemed like a realistic price. I had sent the seller a message asking about what file system it had shortly after they shipped it and they replied by suggesting I format it on a PC and tell them if it is defective, assuming I had received it and it was not working.

PLUS, I bought a 16GB USB drive from my own country. It arrived but when I plugged it into a computer it read as ~512GB. I formatted it and Explorer no longer said 512GB, just the drive letter (or perhaps it was the other way around, I used it once, briefly, to scan for malware on a college PC, last week).

 I had purchased this one to make a Windows OS recovery image from a clean laptop in order to replace the OS on another laptop that has a rootkit infection and corrupted system files. My problem here is, because this is likely an old flash storage chip that has been repurposed, I cannot trust that the OS image I would have put on it would have the expected integrity. Files might not transfer onto it properly, and then I am left with a ruined laptop. 

I paid the same amount for this one - seemed like the most realistically priced of them all and so I was most surprised that once again I had fallen for this scam. 3 times in a few weeks. The seller did try not to scam, in that they sold it as a 16GB drive and unless it turns out to be even smaller they did not lie about that. But it has a ""512GB"" sticker on it and the controller had been spoofed, so it is obviously not new as the listing says, and I cannot trust it with such an important task.

How would you deal with these situations? I will probably contact the seller of the 16GB listing and explain just this and then attempt to return it to them in person. I just want to come out of this without having lost any of my very limited disposable income, so that I can use the ~€30 to buy an actual genuine 16GB USB drive to fix my laptop. I suppose I will have to pray that the other two don't arrive so I can try to get the money back in earnest.

Oh, that was the other thing - the one who sent the ""2TB"" flash drive, they have some kind of tracking on the item. It says it arrived in the country 16 or 17 days ago and the expected arrival date was that long ago - well, from 13th Oct to 1st Nov. I guess I can ask for a refund on the 1st of November? But if they have tracking, they must have shipped it, so will eBay even give the refund?

Edit: The only genuine TB range flash drive listed on my eBay is a Kingston product, listed as €1,600. I wish I'd seen that one before all this happened, lol.",9,4.0,2017-10-29,EBAY,0.08072806149721146,0.8897659778594971,0.029505940154194832

Ebay,Game controller in disgusting state,"I recently bought a Wii U controller from an auction.

Every component I opened uncovered more and more of this dirt. I could not get to the nooks and crannies of the 90° angles.

Ebay,Listing removed after item paid for and shipped?,"Hello, posting here because I think I'll have more luck from Reddit than on eBay. I trust y'all more.

Now, as I said, I already have the money and the item already shipped.
