Ebay,Did ebay ruin their own search function or is it just me?,"Recently began to buy stuff on ebay after a while away. When I used to search things they would all come up right away.

Since when did this change?  


If I type in pokemon joblot for example loads of peppa pig, disney , ben 10 all sorts of stuff comes up that isn't to do with pokemon whatsoever. Then I have to look through pages of rubbish I didn't type in or am not looking for.

Ebay,Just need to get this off my chest...,"G'day mates!

I have been on eBay since 2000 and have been a buyer on the most part. It was only recently(since June 2019) I decided to get back to selling. Sales(CAD$1k+ so far) as I have not much on my listings...average price is between CAD$40-50. My listings are geared towards CAN/USA and a few random countries if I get requests via eBay messaging.

I have this Russian buyer(he's a seller too) with 100% feedback and he messaged me after having seen one of my items. I told him I don't ship to Russia and he asked if I could make an exception. I kind of anticipated some challenges in terms of the language barrier(should something happen(it did!) and longer transit times.

Ok, I thought why not since he seemed like a nice chap(i still think he is but conflicted). Took a leap of faith and out of goodwill. Went and got some shipping rates + insurance and which he promptly paid via PayPal.

Now, the trouble begins when the item was dispatched to USPS and forwarded to another courier for int'l shipment. Apparently, the reshipper I used had issues with the 3rd-party and their service contract terminated. 3 weeks was lost not knowing where the item was but managed to track down after getting assistance from the US distribution center(a huge relief). The parcel was promptly re-routed to another courier for onward dispatch to Russia.

I contacted the Buyer and explained what happened and initially, he was ok but not pleased(could sense from his messages or perhaps the bad translation). So I have been keeping track of the shipment and constantly sending him screenshots and tracking updates. Furnished him the Tracking # and link( [http://mailviewrecipient.fedex.com/](http://mailviewrecipient.fedex.com/)) but he constantly refused to validate and kept using the main tracking ([https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html) ). FedEX FIMS is another service and it's tracking isn't integrated with eBay. 

Some messages I had received were deemed to be insinuating my dishonesty and trying to pull a fast one.

To me, honesty and integrity are two values I hold dearly. I can accept any other criticisms to the point that if someone calls me stupid, I will leave it like that. I don't take to heart because I know myself better. But to impugn my character relentlessly, I decided enough is enough. That's the straw that broke the camel's back.

I went ahead and refunded(on my own accord) him via PayPal and told him he can keep the item when it arrives(still in transit as we speak)...as a souvenir. I politely explained my reasons above and my stand on this. Yes, I lost slightly over CAD$100 for the item+shipping+packaging &amp; insurance with the running around and most importantly my time - a finite resource.  

In a nutshell, I felt good as I gave my absolute best and I simply can't placate this particular Russian Buyer. Should the Buyer dispute any further, eBay has all the documents/messages trails to validate. 

Pardon my rant. Out of curiosity, would you have done the same? Would like to hear your thoughts :) 

Cheers!

Ebay,Should I leave negative feedback?,"I bought a pair of Oakley sunglasses, seller sends me an obvious fake/knockoff pair.  I submit for a return request and they dragged through the return process, always replying on the last day possible and giving excuses, but continually promising to refund my money.  After the refund never shows up the seller claimed they had their paypal account locked due to ""suspicious activity"" and sent me a screenshot of that.  I got ebay involved and they issued me the refund.  The seller asked me not to leave them negative feedback because I got to keep the item.  They have a feedback score of 3 and have a few other designer items listed, which I'm guessing may be fake as well.  The item was shipped to me from New York, but when I went to do the return it said their return address was in India.  

I assume this account won't last long on ebay, but part of me wants to leave negative feedback as I'm pretty sure they are trying to pull one over on people who may not know they are getting fake items.

Ebay,"Seller sent used item even though it was new, refused to acknowledge it was used, and now is asking me to revise my return request.","So the title sort of explains itself, but I’ll go a little more in depth. So I bought a “Brand New” board game and it came in the mail today. When I opened the box, it wasn’t factory sealed wrapped and was taped with scotch tape and not even factor tape if it didn’t originally come with shrink wrap. I took it out of the box and it was very obviously played with and used, so I messaged the seller. I assumed it was just a mistake on their part with the listing, no harm no foul. But then the seller stands that it’s a new item and not used and won’t acknowledge it’s used. Fine, whatever, they said I could just return it. So I requested a return as “item doesn’t match description” and simple said “the item is obviously used but the listing said it was new” and then I get a message from the seller asking me to revise the return request and with a different reason. 

It was only a $15 game, so I’m not too upset about it, but am I in the wrong at all here? I mostly buy on eBay and I’ve never had a seller do something like this. They have over 300 positive feedback so I’m surprised this is happening. Any advice on what to do is appreciated.

Ebay,EBay is low IQ trash,"The site is worth billions, but they cant make a site that ""just works"" to save their life. **New issue #23443353: International buyer edition**\- 

I have ALWAYS checked ""ship to US only"" when creating a listing. Suddenly about 3 months ago, I started getting foreigners bidding and buy-it-now-ing my items, which is problematic for many reasons.

1) I am astronomically more likely to get scammed when dealing with international buyers, and astronomically less likely to have solutions in the case.

2) When I priced my item at $60 with free shipping, I didnt have paying $70 in shipping in mind (you can tell they know what they are doing when they immediately message you ""i buy u ship now ok"" etc

So I call eBay and ask them how it is that my ""ships to US only"" item has been purchased by someone in Yugoslavia. They then give me some non-asnwer about how somehow ""ships to US only"" doesnt mean people outside the US cant buy it. Im like ""ooooooook, so how DO I prevent them from bidding/buying?"" and they give me some esoteric instructions to reach a secret page where I can choose ""dont allow foreigners to bid or purchase"". Fair enough, I set the settings up and forget about the whole ordeal, being the reasonable guy that I am. They are just a small startup, after all, so who can blame some oversight like that. Ebay is just trying to scratch out a living like everyone else.

So, fast forward to today, when someone in France buys my item.",20,10,2019-08-03,EBAY,0.026255205273628235,0.9268882274627686,0.04685661569237709

Ebay,eBay Ignoring Obvious Liars,"I bought some new shoes for my holidays in advance for August. I seriously hate it when buyers buy something from me and then message me to say 'I'm going on holiday in 2 days so I need this asap'. And they didn't even select my 1st Class postage option...

Ugh, anyway back to my shoes. I waited 2 weeks for them to arrive. Estimated delivery said they would arrived within 3 to 5 days. I contacted the seller to ask if I could have the tracking number in case they had been given to a neighbour. The seller took 4 more days to respond with the tracking information.

So I input the tracking information onto the couriers website and get this, the seller only just arranged for my item to be collected from them on the very same day they messaged me with the tracking information! So here's the timeline of my purchase...

*27th June - Bought shoes (Seller states same day dispatch with 3 to 5 days delivery)*

*13th July - I messaged them to ask about tracking information*

*18th July - Seller responded with tracking information*

*Tracking information states 18th July - Order Placed and that's it. Nothing else has happened since...*

Today is the 3rd of August and I still don't have my shoes! I went back to message the seller, taking a glance at their recent feedback. They had 100% positive back in June when I bought these shoes. In the past month they've received over 20 negatives from buyers stating they never received their goods and the seller has replied to each of these feedbacks with 'Avoid this buyer. Liar and a thief.' or 'Avoid buyer. Expects fast delivery for Economy post.'

So I went straight to eBay to open a case for not received. Seller uploaded tracking information to the case, a completely different number to the one they gave me on the **18th July!** This tracking info states that this package was delivered on 25th June, before I had even bought them. The order was picked up by the couriers on **14th June!**

eBay closed the case in the sellers favour and I'm out of pocket and no shoes!

Seriously eBay, I didn't even buy the shoes on the 14th June. I bought them on the 27th so how can my parcel have already been in transit and delivered before I had even purchased them!

I'm just waiting on an email reply back from the eBay agent I was talking to on the phone now. I am so annoyed that this can even happen. I would never dream of doing something like this to a buyer. Its an obvious setup to change the tracking number like this.

Ebay,eBay is charging me an extra $1500 in sellers fees,"So the long story is that I have been selling used auto parts on eBay for a few years now and it has turned into a relatively successful business. I am doing between 20-30k a month in sales. I am top rated, so I offer free shipping and accept free returns. 


With the nuance of used items, I strive to list every blemish and aspect of my products as thoroughly as I can. In each listing, I ask my buyers to reach out to me first if there is any issue with their purchase so that I can make their experience positive and fix any issue.

Anyways, as some of you know, buyer can choose a designation for their return i.e. ""Doesn't Fit"" ""Arrived Damaged"" Changed My Mind, etc... 

As of June 2018 eBay started a new seller metric for returns that are in the category of ""Not as Described"". If you have a certain percentage of returns (for example mine is 5% of my returns) in the category of ""Item Not As Described"", you will receive an extra selling fee of 5% added onto the normal selling fee for being ""Very High"" compared to other sellers in the same product category. This whole metric is to prevent sellers from abusing eBay and to give buyers a positive experience.


This is where I get upset. I was placed into the very high category in July. I contacted eBay because I saw that this was going to be adding on 5% fees to my final value fees and I wanted to better understand what my options were and how I could prevent this in the future.

Many of my buyers incorrectly choose their return reason. If an item arrived damaged, they should choose ""Item arrived Damaged"", but I have several that have put ""Item not as described"" as the return reason. The buyer just wants to return the item and I absolutely understand. I accept all returns within 30 days and I refund the buyer right away when I receive the item back. I have had buyers who received an item and they thought it would fit their vehicle, but it didn't even though the part number and fitments were clearly listed. Instead of them choosing ""item does not fit"" they chose ""Item not as described""

I get it, they just want to return the item, but depending on the designation, it heavily affects the buyer now. I went to chat with an eBay representative and after I was transferred around to 6 other team members for a cumulative time of almost 6 hours on the phone, I was told there is no way to appeal a buyer who chose the wrong return designation.


So basically, if a buyer incorrectly chooses the return designation, there is NO recourse for getting this fixed. It doesn't matter if they make a mistake, you cannot appeal this according to every eBay representative I had the pleasure of speaking with today.


I feel like I am at the end of my rope as far as knowing what I can do differently or what I can change. At this point, I feel like it is extortion to not allow a way to fix a mistake that was beyond your control and to charge a large amount of money for it.

Ebay,Someone set up an account with my email,"So I woke up this morning to three emails from eBay UK in my inbox. One congratulating me on signing up and two notifications of successful purchase.

Except....

I don't have and have never had any account with eBay UK. I am in Australia.

I think they must be phishing emails, trying to trick me into clicking on something in the emails so they can scoop up my details or ransomware me. But an online search didn't come up with anything. So I go to eBay UK directly and try and create a new account with the same email address used and sure enough it says that an account already exists. So I click reset password, and now have control of this account. I've set up 2FA, and changed all the things. They were mid-bid on an auction so I have contacted that seller to say ITS NOT ME

Has anyone come across this before?

The two items bought were under $5 so I thought they were doing the old trick of testing with a couple of small purchases. But when I looked at the credit card number saved on the account was not one of mine. I am really not sure what is going on. It seems someone has set up an account with my email address - could they have accidentally put a typo in their address which made it the same as my email address? Does eBay UK not have any kind of two step email verification process?

Have I inadvertently ""hacked"" this person's eBay account?

There does not seem to be a way to contact eBay directly about it, just endless ""help"" articles. I managed to find a page where you can get eBay to call me or I can call them, but neither option works.

If anyone has come across this before or has any advice I would be grateful hearing it.

**Next day update:** I posted in the internal eBay community forum and someone there gave me advice on how to get in touch with eBay (it is ridiculously hard to find this page) and I have flagged what has happened with them.

Ebay,Wrong address question,"I bought an item and the tracking showed it was delivered, but it was nowhere to be found. I did the standard procedure of double checking my property and checked with all my neighbors and none of them had it either. I checked on paypal and the shipping info I provided is correct. The strange thing is I called UPS and they said the address AND name was different than mine on the package, but was delivered in my same town and zip code. They would not tell me the address or the name for ""confidentiality reasons"". I messaged the seller and opened a case a few days ago, the seller has not replied to any messages or the case. At this point I'm just waiting for Ebay to step in. All I want is a refund. Do you think I have a poor chance of getting a refund if the seller proves the package was sent to my zip?

I want to start a business, but surprise, I don't don't know what or really even how. All I know is that in the past I've sold a few things on eBay and it seems like the most accessible thing to do.

Ebay,I think I panicked and made a bad decision lol,"So somebody purchased a Pokemon card for me for 4.50. Due to the price, I shipped it with a stamp in a regular envelope. I know there's a risk of it being lost, but so far I've never had a problem and I also make sure to pack it very well so there's no damage. Of course, if it was lost or damaged I would refund the buyer.

They messaged me asking for tracking, I let them know it would be shipped in an envelope with a stamp. They started telling me how that's frowned upon and the card will get damaged and that they thought I was using tracking and that's why I declined their original low-ball offer.

I replied back (here's where I started to panic lol) and let them know I've never had issues and asked if they just wanted a refund and they can keep the card. I was scared of them leaving negative feedback &amp; I felt like that's where it was going. 

They said this: 

""It does not matter if you haven’t had issues with your shipments. It says clearly when I ordered it that the purchase would be shipped first class package not letter. Letter if for letters that’s why it’s called first class letter.

You are actually sending a package not a letter. It just saves you money that way. eBay policy clearly states that all transactions should have a tracking number otherwise you cannot price delivery.

Other sites automatically refund now when no tracking is used.""

I wasn't trying to scam anybody and I didn't charge anything for delivery. Should I just refund and block? If I block can they still leave feedback? Am I completely in the wrong?",46,14,2019-08-05,EBAY,0.1318661868572235,0.8444647789001465,0.023669058457016945

Ebay,Ebay continues to make it a pleasure to be a seller (sarcasm),"Started an auction two weeks ago and the item sold last Sunday.  The winner was a foreign account with 0 feedback.  Immediately after it sold the buyer started peppering me with messages every minute or two.  He totaled over 15 messages sent to me within an hour of purchasing.  They were very strange messages, for example, he sent me 4 messages with just the listing picture of the item he purchased and no text. He sent me two messages that just said ""Hi"" and nothing else.  Then he started sending messages asking me where to send payment.  Then he asked me for my email address to work out payment.  At this point I called Ebay and explained that I thought he was a scammer and I'd like to cancel the transaction if possible and have my fees refunded.  They said no, and I should give him time to pay.  He of course didn't pay so I opened an unpaid case and he of course still hasn't paid.  I can close the case tomorrow according to ebay, but I wanted to close it today so that I can relist it for auction on a Sunday since Sunday's are good for auctions.  This is an expensive item and I've wasted two weeks on this knowing he wasn't going to pay, and each rep at Ebay I talked to just went off the script. I at least thought they'd take action on the fact that he asked to take the communication outside ebay, but the ebay rep I just talked to stated that's not against the rules, it just voids any protection from ebay.

Ebay,Why did I give eBay a second chance .. smh.,"For over the past 5 years I sold on eBay and quickly became a power seller (no biggie) sold thousands of items in my inventory and made a nice amount of money. It became my full time job. Over the first few years of selling I had my returns and scammers which were far and few in between. I’m confident with my photos and descriptions, mostly offer free shipping blah blah blah. The past year has been so insanely BAD with scams, and remorse purchases and buyers abusing returns. After two unauthorized credit card scams, threats, over $500 + lost on items I cannot resell and getting actual garbage returned in a box ... I closed my eBay store and moved to other selling platforms. 
So I figured I would give eBay just one more chance. Thought maybe they might have cleaned up the BS. So I listed 50 items over the past few months. Sold 9 and already one person hasn’t paid (best offer) and tells me they have to wait till next Friday, another recently won an auction on a pair of vintage leather gloves and it’s been 3 days and he too hasn’t paid. I log onto my PC and see that EVERY SINGLE feedback he left sellers is negative. Sellers risked their accounts to leave false positives to warn others as well. As soon as I get off my PC and go to walk my dog I get a return request on a pair of pants I sold weeks ago and I do not accept returns. They sold for $8.00 and now she’s angry that I will not accept a return and pay to get them sent back. I already had another sob story about how this lady left domestic violence and wants to know how low I can go on sneakers. 
Maybe it’s me? This is not exaggerated. I managed customer service and returns at Walmart. I survived Black Friday and after holiday returns. Still... eBay is more stressful. 
So I’m going to leave again for other selling platforms. I’m posting this rant up just so others might not feel alone. Has anyone else left?",13,2,2019-08-06,EBAY,0.08217489719390869,0.8858518600463867,0.03197324648499489

Ebay,"I purchased and item, and never received it, and I have absolute proof of that from USPS, and Ebay nor Paypal protected me, and I think it's because they don't know how to deal with it.","I purchased a $360 Motherboard from China, a purchase I make almost on a daily basis for my IT company.  I see no harm in buying items since I am a Power seller on Ebay and purchase upwards of 5 items per day through their service, so when I purchased an item from a first time seller, I saw no danger in doing so, but boy was I wrong.  The seller filled a box with rocks, and mailed them to a random address in my city, and provided eBay with the tracking info of: LT548993349CN  The trick here, there is no signature or delivery confirmation and Ebay does not have the ability to view what address the seller sent it to, but since their policy is only to receive confirmation from USPS of delivery, they sided in favor of the seller.  

I spoke with my postman, who I have known for years, and although against the law, he confirmed he looked at the intranet report, and the box went to a random address on Saint George street, definitely not my company address.  So I submitted a complaint to USPS while also escalating the issue to Paypal.  USPS came back with this email:


&gt;Thank you for using USPS.com.
We regret to inform you that after thoroughly searching for your mail we were unable to locate your missing item(s).

&gt;Search Request Details:
Request Date: 06/04/2019
Reference: Search ID #7096517
Tracking Number: LT548993349CN

This was still not enough for Paypal, they wanted to see the intranet report, that is illegal for the USPS to release as it is protected under federal law.


So anyone who wants free money on Ebay can simply follow this same recipe.  Sell something expensive, ship a box that weighs the same, to a random address in the same city, and since Ebay can only see the city on the tracking, you will escape with all the buyer's money, scott free.

Ebay,Miracles do happen!,"I wanted to share my happy story of getting one negative feedback removed because the buyer didn't fully read my listing.

I sell live plants. The buyer lives in CA, a state that I have to ship bare root to. I state this very clearly in my listing.

Buyer messages me complaining about not having a pot when she received the plant. I told her my policy and also pointed out in the listing where it says I would do that. I apologized that she was disappointed but remained firm. She stopped responding a few days ago.

Today she dinged me with a negative citing that the plant didn't arrive in a pot as described in my listing and also that my communication was unsatisfactory (because I didn't do what she wanted?).

I called ebay and the first rep sided with her. I didn't communicate my thoughts clearly with him.

I waited a few minutes then called again. I explained that she left me negative feedback because of my policy, which was clearly outlined in the item description. I guess the P word was the trick... the second rep agreed with me and removed it... WOOT!

Ebay,Seller lied about testing an item. I want to have it repaired rather than returning.,"I buy old film cameras on eBay. I'm careful to only purchase items that have been described as ""tested"" and in ""good"" or ""great"" or even ""pristine"" or ""excellent"" working condition.

But the following has happened now on a number of occasions. A camera described as working ""great"" is flat-out inoperable.  Furthermore, the item is missing a key part (battery compartment or some other electrical component) that actually makes it impossible to test in its given state.

Usually, I'm willing to put in a little extra effort and money to have the item repaired. I'd rather do this than return the item and have to try to find a duplicate, especially if it's a rarer item. However, that means I have just greatly overpaid for an item that should have been listed as ""as is"" or ""untested.""

Ebay,"Account Compromised 6 Months Ago, eBay Still hasn’t Issued a Full Refund","Back in December I noticed my account had been hacked when some settings had changed, including my email address.  I immediately contacted eBay about it, changed my password, and set up two step authentication.  I changed everything that I noticed had been tampered with back and thought everything was fine after that.

Fast forward 6 months and I noticed my invoice was incredibly high for how little I sold the previous month.  Since the invoices don’t list what you are paying for without you going into your account and clicking around (not user friendly at all... surprise, surprise), I never bothered to check.  Well, I checked and it turns out I was being charged a $21.95 store fee.  I never signed up or converted my account to a store, the hacker must have and since he changed my email address I never got any notification about it.

I immediately contacted eBay and had them close the store subscription and i asked for a refund.  Everything seemed to go fine.  They saw my initial contact regarding the account compromise and knew it was the hacker that set up the store and not myself since the timeline correlated.  A week later I noticed they didn’t credit me the $43.19 activation and month subscription fee.  They only credited me the $131.70 for the 6 months of subscription fees.l for the following months.  Not only that, it all went into my eBay account as a credit.

Since then I have contacted them twice more (been almost 3 weeks since the initial contact), and I feel like I am getting the run around.  They keep telling me it can take 1-3 weeks for the credit to go back to my card instead of being an eBay credit.  I told them it’s already been that long, but the initial person I spoke with “forgot” to finalize the request.  They also keep telling me the 43.19 dollar charge has been escalated and they are waiting for a response on that.  

At this point I feel like they are just trying to stall me and hope I forget.  I don’t sell much on eBay, only doing it on the side and making a few hundred dollars a month.  Some months I don’t sell at all.  Because of this it would take me years to use up the credit.  

Am I being jacked around, or is this their usual process?  Should I email them, and when they respond about it taking a few weeks, take that and contact my credit card and dispute the charges?  What is the best course of action here?",2,3,2019-08-09,EBAY,0.09315918385982513,0.8806774616241455,0.02616334892809391

Ebay,Got my first neg in 16 years but probably avoid all kinds of drama,"So this 1 feedback buyer made a reasonable offer on a $250 item and I accepted. After a day the buyer messaged in very broken English to say they'd pay within 48 hours. Yep- that's how it works. No problem right? Probably just a new person. We were all new once. 60 hours go by with no payment so I start the unpaid item case.

While I'm in there, I go to change my settings so unpaid cases open automatically, and I do a checkup on the rest of my settings. Stroll on through my buyer requirements activity log and I see that the buyer had been blocked the same day I accepted their offer because they're not in a country I ship to. I also glanced at the offer history and found the reasonable offer was buyer's last and final because their previous unreasonable ones had been auto-rejected.

Buyer pays, so the unpaid case auto-closes. Paypal doesn't match eBay name and doesn't match shipping address name. I call eBay and the rep agrees buyer was trying to get around the auto-block and says I'll need to cancel for problem with address but that I'll need to give it some time for everything to recognize that the unpaid case is closed. Rep also says if I get a defect or a neg to call back because this is the buyer's fault and that she'll leave a note on my account about that. Cool. I'm feeling generous/suspicious so I email the buyer and ask them to help me understand the problem with the address and country discrepancies in the hopes I'll get some meat for the call I'll no doubt have to make.

After around 24 hours I haven't heard back, the unpaid case is fully cleared, and I'm at the end of my 1 day shipping window so I cancel the order. Immediately the buyer emails a bunch of abuse in really broken English about how insulting I am to cancel without contacting them and that they have tons of proof (1 feedback?!) that they buy stuff all the time and that their address is just fine.

24 hours after that they left a neg saying I cancelled for no reason. I was unsuccessful in getting the feedback removed on the first call but I'll call daily until I get it fixed. The rep said ""The note on your account is there but the buyer had a negative experience- even if it's not true and you did give them a reason which I see in the messages. It does not matter that the buyer was cheating the block- they get to leave feedback, and besides- you have plenty of good feedback.""

So I still have my item, I got all my fees back, and I live to sell another day. I feel like if I'd shipped the thing I'd have ended up with no money, a box of rocks sent back, and a negative feedback. At least this way I only got the neg.

Ebay,"As the 'buyer', am I in the wrong in this situation?","**Lambaste or downvote me if you want, I have no idea if I am in the right or wrong here, pretty new to Ebay that's all, just looking for some direction and advice**

*Pictures with minimal information proving my story is legit will be provided at the end of the post*

Alright, it's August 7th and I am browsing Ebay late at night **on my phone** for an item I need for a gaming setup. All cool and dandy, I find two ads that I like and me being in Canada and the two items are being sold from the US, the prices are always wacky. I am fairly new to Ebay, so I am checking the information on both items and they have the options to either place a bid or offer a price. So the first (and last) item I end up checking has very conflicting price estimates, so I go into the offer screen to try and get a 'final price' conversion and I settle on $US 100 after finding a suitable Canadian price that has the shipping included, as I am about to press back out of it I dropped my phone and somehow the offer I had prepared was sent through.. I realize what had happened and I checked to see if there was anything that I could do, all I found online is that I need to kindly ask the seller to decline the accidental offer that was made and all should be well.

So 30 minutes later I contact the seller, of the item that had literally 5 1/2 days remaining for a bid to go through, kindly explaining that I had submitted the offer as a mistake and that I didn't want to purchase (as I found out the other component was closer to Canada and offered better shipping.)

I sleep great, but I am greeted by a notification around 8 1/2 hours later after waking saying that my 'offer' that I kindly asked the seller to decline as I wasn't looking to buy, was accepted.. are you kidding me.. Not only did being polite not work, but this seller definitely went out of his/her to obviously read my kind message, disregard that my offer wasn't a genuine one and then accepted it anyways. I immediately put in a request to cancel the order. Needless to say as the 'buyer', I was and am not happy. I kindly asked the seller to please cancel the order as I am not looking to pay, something that I made very clear after my accidental offer went through.

A day passes, no reply. Probably not a big deal, maybe they don't check their messages all the time, I understand and give the benefit of the doubt. I am browsing through his/her page however and I realize, not even 30 minutes after they accepted my offer that I clearly did not want them to accept, THEY POSTED THE SAME ITEM. Is this common practice? Who does something like that? I feel like I am being taken advantage of now (not sure if I am or not.) So I wait another day to see if anything develops...

Day 2, nothing. At this point I am starting to get pretty disgruntled as I am getting a bad feeling this seller will be opening a unpaid item dispute against me because I am very firm on not paying now after this experience I have had with the seller. I send them another kind message detailing that I was courteous through this whole, unavoidable process and how I am very set on not paying after the way I have been treated as a buyer. I told them I would appreciate it if they please cancelled my offer to avoid any issues (at this point I am aware that there will be fees charged against him/her for the final selling fee or whatever it is called but I really don't care because this was more than avoidable on their end.)

Day 3, today. No reply. I am not even wanting to send a message because I am clearly being ignored and this item is definitely going to have a unpaid dispute opened against me. I really don't know what to do and I feel like I have been taken advantage of in this whole situation. I know it is my responsibility to pay for an item after a bid is won or an offer is accepted but I provided this seller with ample warning to decline my accidental offer.

Ebay,Returns and eBay Bucks,"Back in June, there was a promotion for 13% eBay Bucks on any item purchased through the mobile app. I purchased an item during this time and earned $100.00 in eBay Bucks, which I then spent because they would have expired otherwise. There were problems with the item though, and I am probably going to return it, but I am concerned about what's going to happen to my eBay Bucks.

My understanding is that returning this item will cause my eBay Bucks to go to -$100. I have also read on Reddit and other places that if I have a negative balance, I will no longer be eligible for eBay Bucks promotions. If this is true, then it would seem that I would have to make up the $100 using the standard 1% earned on eBay purchases, i.e. by spending $10,000 in merchandise on eBay! Paying off the $100 seems like it would be better than this, but there doesn't seem to be any way to do this.

Is my analysis here accurate? If I return this item, am I effectively never going to receive eBay Bucks ever again? Is there anything I can do?",20,3,2019-08-10,EBAY,0.05789186432957649,0.9030553102493286,0.039052821695804596
Ebay,Item Arrived Broken But Usable,"To preface this, it has been years since I've used eBay so I'm not familiar with their policies and procedures anymore.  But I ordered a collectible figure on eBay last week, and after a very annoying lack of contact and response from the seller (unrelated, but still annoying), it was delivered today.  The item was described as 'used but in good condition' and the seller claimed they never took it out of the box though a previous owner had.  As I planned to open and display the figure, this wasn't that important to me.  However, when I opened it up, I found that the piece that actually holds the figure up in the chosen pose is broken and can't function like it's meant to; it keeps falling apart.  It didn't happen during shipping as the shipping box and product box are undamaged as was the rest of the figure.  It looks like the only option eBay offers is to request a refund and send the item back.  Since the figure itself is intact and it's just a piece I have to replace, is this my only option?  Are there alternative options like a partial refund so I can buy a display stand that isn't cracked up?",11,3,2019-08-10,EBAY,0.0595380999147892,0.9016322493553162,0.03882963955402374

Ebay,Free vs Charged Shipping and Sales Tax can affect the total amount a buyer pays,"Many states are now requiring sales tax be collected on eBay sales. There are certain states that include shipping and handling in the taxable amount and others that do not.

For buyers in certain states, it will always be cheaper to purchase items that charge for shipping vs free shipping (assuming the purchase prices are equivalent)

However, the return label the seller provided didn't work because he sent me a priority label and the shoe box was too big so it didn't fit in the priority box and I had to pay for shipping myself. There is no way for me to change the return tracking number myself so I had to mark as shipped and call eBay to give them the new tracking number. The shoes just got delivered today about ten hours ago and he hasn't responded when I asked may I please have my refund. Do you guys think I will still get my refund if I escalate it even though the tracking number on the return hasn't shown as delivered since I had to use a different one?

Ebay,Which of these reasons is most likely for sales plummet during a suspension?,"My account was suspended for 30 days on July 25th for selling a ""fake"" (non-brand) item. The item was advertised as fake, acknowledged by the buyers as fake, and had 100% positive feedback after hundreds sold, but eBay just doesn't like this I guess so I will have to deal with it - lesson learned and I am okay with it and won't re-list it.

However, since I have been banned, sales of my other listings have slowed to a halt. I used to sell about 6 of them a day (4 different items which I have high quantities of), and now I am selling maybe 1 every 3 days.

So I'm wondering - what is the single most likely cause of this? I'm thinking the possible reasons are:

1. When someone is temporarily suspended, eBay does not ""help"" that seller at all. They do not show their products on suggested item lists, and do not place them high in the searches
2. Because I am unable to list new items due to the suspension, eBay penalizes sellers who do not list things frequently
3. Because I am not selling as many items in general (due to my removed listing being my main moneymaker), eBay is not advertising my other products like they used to

Or any other possible reasons you can think of would be of great help. 

Also one last question: Once I am re-instated, is it possible that my sales may raise again for these items? I have a 100% overall feedback rating, have never missed a shipment, zero late shipments, etc. So my only hitch is the suspension.

Ebay,Multiple people sending the same question about a few of my items for sale,"So this is a new one for me. I can’t figure out the reasoning behind it. I’ve had a small amount of items listed for sale for about three weeks. They haven’t had a lot of views but I’m in no rush because I’ve been busy with other stuff. Anyway, today I was out running errands and I randomly got a message from someone requesting a measurement of a jacket I have listed. I figured I’d take the measurement and send it once I got back home. No big deal, nothing unusual. Well, about 30 minutes later I get another message asking the same question for a different jacket I have listed and the message is from a completely different account. Fast forward a few hours later, I now have five of these messages asking about the same measurement for four different jackets I have listed and none of the messages are from the same accounts and all of them have good feedback. 

The size is listed on every single item. The brands of the jackets are very common and having worn these brands for years, I’ve always found the sizing to be consistent. So it’s just really odd to me that I’m randomly getting these messages from multiple people all on the same day asking the same thing.

Ebay,First sale and buyer wants to return,"I am new to ebay and I just sold a camera lens for a $400 offer (buy it now was $500). I had listed the item as not accepting returns. The buyer had all positive feedback over several years. The buyer asked lots of questions and I gave him, in my opinion, very thorough answers include test photos. After he had already made the offer I even confirmed with him that he was okay with the price before I accepted it. 

After I had accepted the offer and printed the label and was ready to ship he was still asking about the image quality and characteristics of the lens and expressed disappointment that the lens might flare (this is a property of most camera lenses). However after some more back and forth he said he was looking forward to getting the package.

I shipped on a Friday and it was delivered Monday. He then tells me that he received the package (even thanked me for the fast shipping) but that he was unsatisfied with the lens because the focus was ""not smooth at all"" and that he was under the impression that the focus was ""in working order"". The focus is absolutely in working order, it focuses the image, that's what a lens does, so that is just a complete lie. With regards to it being ""not being smooth"", that seems like a pretty subjective opinion. I'm not sure how I could have listed the ""smoothness"" of the lens, it was smooth for me in all of my use. 

Now he wants a return and refund. I personally think he just has buyers remorse based on his messages after I accepted the offer. I keep seeing how buyers basically have all the power in these situations so my question is: should I just give up and accept the return/refund him? It just seems crazy that someone can just lie or say that the item isn't up to their subjective standards and get a refund.",16,6,2019-08-13,EBAY,0.020508984103798866,0.9179326295852661,0.061558354645967484

Ebay,"Reality sucks: GSP shipment 'not received' and I feel bad, but not my problem.","Buyer contacts me today. International customerin Europe via GSP. They ordered two separate items on two different days, sent separately. One shows 'delivered' on July 25 - \~10 days after purchase. The other (sent 1 day later) still shows as ""in transit"". Their message mirrors that. They say one item received, one not. So I'm feeling like they're giving me legit info / not trying to scam.

It's now 31 days after purchase.

I've got tracking that proves it was delivered to the GSP hub. *Technically, what happens after that isn't my problem.*

The regrettable truths are these:

* The 100% ""correct"" customer-service-first thing for me to do, knowing they *really* haven't got their item weeks after it should have arrived, is refund them. That means I 'bend over' financially and take a hit for a lost shipment someone -else- did... Knowing I'll NEVER get recompensed by Pitney-Bowes once I issue the refund.
* I could tell them to file an INR. Since it's &lt;30 days after estimated delivery, I believe they still could. That will show up as a 'case' for me. I could then spend an hour on the phone with eBay getting that pushed off to Pitney Bowes and let it go from there... Unless I get the wrong rep, the moon is out of phase, etc. and eBay tries to stick me with it. Then I go into hours of calls to eBay and escalations to get the right person to accept that it's GSP and my responsibility ends when it hits Kentucky, and get it all sorted out. EVENTUALLY, after probably 3-4 hours lost hours on the phone, I'm made whole... Less those hours.
* My best choice as a -practical- matter is probably to simply not respond. The customer probably won't file an INR at all, or it will be too late to file when they try since we're close to the cutoff. I won't have to deal with it, they'll just be stuck, and thus the game continues. Maybe they'll call eBay and get a 'courtesy' credit... or not.
* The crass / shitty alternative is to write them back, tell them we're going to look into it, please give us some time to sort it out, and try to do 'delay of game' past the deadline to file INR.

Kinda sucks given my perception is 

* The 'right' thing to do from an ethics standpoint is exactly the 'wrong' thing to do from a practical viewpoint.
* The 'right' thing to do as a *practical* matter is less-than-ethical, IMHO.
* If I were a less-ethical person, I'd have strong incentive to try and 'drag it out' past the point of them filing at all.

Ebay,I got screwed and I’m not sure what to do...,"I’ve been selling for 12 years. 100% rating, but pretty small time (2-10 sales a month). I sold a holiday Barbie to someone, who haggled price from 30$ to 25$ free shipping, they took almost a week to pay. I sent it well wrapped and safe, and within an hour of it pinging delivered they hit me up claiming it’s damaged. Ok.... 

I’m out of town, so I offer half the sale amount back and they keep it, but I need to see a pic. They send a blurry picture that doesn’t look like any damage. They demand a refund PLUS a new item. I say they can just return my doll. They aren’t responding.  I stupidly let eBay auto generate a label.

They take over a week to ship it. They use a box 4x the size of the item and filled it with literally lbs or filler, and a nasty note that said I need to accept the return AND send them a brand new doll or else they will give me bad feedback (to a different address than the original address?). The shipping that was charged to me for their shipping job: over 20$!!!! This item was 14oz with package when I shipped it...

The doll is so damaged, obviously smashed... I would have seen this even in their awful photo. I was flustered and upset, but just said fine, accepted the refund for 25$.


But on further examination I noticed the doll has a written price in sharpie ... like it was from a thrift store!!! Mine had no markings on it. I opened a case about the seller, but I highly doubt they will do anything.

Ebay,Gave Refund Through Ebay Claim then PayPal Gave Another One,"I sold an item worth $300 back in May and it was eventually declared lost in shipping. The buyer filed a dispute/claim on Ebay and I accepted it and gave them the refund of $300 which was charged to my credit card. This happened near the end of July. A couple of weeks later, I noticed on my PayPal that the buyer filed a dispute there. I messaged them asking why they did that when I had already given the refund through Ebay, but they said that they never received the money.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was out the $300 that mysteriously disappeared and now I had a pending balance of -$300 in my PayPal. Well, today it was approved in the buyer's favor and I was hit with an additional $20 charge due to overdrafting my PayPal account. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering what I should do next as I have now given a double refund, one through Ebay and one through PayPal. I am not sure how this is even possible but I am now down $320 for no apparent reason. I don't even know who to contact as I feel like I am just going to be bounced back and forth between PayPal and Ebay.

Ebay,"Buyer has buyer's remorse and initiated Chargeback, what should I do?","Hi all,

I have been an ebay seller for the past 3 years, and unluckily has experienced my first chargeback. Would love to share and also obtain some opinion from you all on how to handle the current situation with fighting the claim.

I sold a dress to a buyer on ebay with a strict no returns policy, where a month after having sold the item, the buyer tries to set up a return request on ebay, stating that the item is beautiful but does not fit. ( the sizing is clearly stated on the listing, with the returns policy clearly iterated throughout to let buyers to think carefully about their purchase as there is strictly no returns.) This case is obviously buyer's remorse. 

I initially thought about accepting the return, but due to ebay's error with the return address they had actually advised not to accept the return, and hence I had no choice but to reject the return.

The buyer then went on file a paypal 'Item not as described' claim, which on submitting all documents of the listing, the sizing and the pictures, paypal has also ruled in my favor. ( It was very clearly a case of buyer's remorse which, with Paypal's strict rules and favor for the buyer's side, is still ruling in my favor).

The buyer then went on to file a chargeback on the item and Paypal has hold off the funds. This really does come off a shock given that the buyer honestly have no claim - the item is perfectly fulfilled and she currently possess the item. There is nothing wrong with the item - I wonder how the customer can file a chargeback merely based on 'item does not fit well'? The buyer has clearly abused her multiple channels and the system to get what she wants.

I had submitted a series of documents to Paypal to fight for the chargeback, and having not heard back from paypal for a while on this case, paypal today has sent me an email telling me that the credit company has 'reversed' the funds, but they are still fighting against the claim.

I have several question regarding this case:

1. The customer claim that the item does not 'fit', but the sizing has been clearly stated on the listing. Does the customer has the valid reason to file the chargeback in the first place?
2. To fight a claim in these cases, what are the best documents and evidence should I provide? I had currently provided the listing, eBay and paypal's ruiling for the return, and detailed pictures of the item.
3. The customer currently has both the item AND the money - in the ridiculous case that the credit card company ruled in favor of the customer, would the credit card company at least require the customer to return the item, and any suggestions on how we can obtain the item back?
4. Paypal has seller protection against chargeback, which with their ruling of the buyer's claim in favor of my claim makes more the sense for this to be covered under the seller protection policy. However paypal has sneakily just took my funds out - How should I approach paypal to fulfill their promise with the seller protection against chargebacks?
5. I was thinking of reaching out to the buyer over ebay to ask her to at least return the dress to me - wondering if you would recommend communication with the buyer from now on, and whether to ask the buyer to return the dress back to me? Technically currently the case is still open as paypal is still disputing the case with the buyer's financial institution, and wondering whether reaching out to her to arrange a return will run the case. 

Would love to hear your sharing of any stories and experiences you have had with chargebacks for transactions with paypal, and also how to tackle with paypal and their seller protection policy. ( I know they will likely to sneakily state 'oh it's not covered under blah blah blah' but there must be some way to hold them accountable to what they claim to help sellers with in their advertised services.)

Ebay,eBay bucks problem with $500 cap,"I bought some stuff with the recent 10% eBay bucks promotion. Unfortunately, in one $1200 purchase, there was a  listing error and I received a different item than what was listed. 

Problem is, due to $500 eBay bucks cap, I didn’t get the full 10% eBay bucks from my LAST purchase as my return had not yet processed. (Meaning the $100 eBay bucks earned from the $1200 purchase was still in my account.)

When I get a refund on my $1200 order, the 100 dollar eBay bucks I earned will also be taken away, putting me at $400 eBay bucks earned.  

Can I call eBay and get the eBay bucks from my last order added on after my return goes through? Anyone have any experience with this?

Ebay,"(Vent) Sold an item on ebay, turns out it was (maybe) defective, made a deal for customer to deal with warranty exchange (it was 100% under warranty), buyer tries to sell item on ebay and forces return after it fails.","I'm not really looking for help as I know it's just how ebay works but I need to vent. 

Sold a technology item for $400 on Ebay, fully tested, brand new, working 100%. Clearly stated in the description is that this is an enthusiast product and will require some technical knowledge and tweaking to get it running. 

Seller receives the item and contacts me about it not working, after probing for details it turns out his PC doesn't meet the specs required. So far he seems reasonable, I offer to accept the return but he decides he would rather upgrade his PC. Neat.

3 Weeks later he contacts me (EDIT: and initiates the return process in ebay) and tells me that it works for maybe an hour and then stops working, every time he uses it. I can't troubleshoot this for him because he refuses to call me or send me details (I gave him my number, asked for screenshots/specs/etc). I offer him a choice: I would throw in another accessory item worth about $100 and he would initiate the warranty exchange, or he can return it for a full refund and I'll do it and sell the replacement. He chose to keep it and get extra stuff.

2 weeks later he contacts me again saying he wants to return it again. At this point I'm out over $150 in shipping costs alone. I told him if he must return it, I will accept it, but I need everything back and don't want to refund shipping costs since it has turned into a case of buyers remorse. Fine.

1 week later I receive notification from ebay that he has mailed the return. I looked at his history and see that he has tried reselling the item on ebay, with no mention of any defects or problems, along with the accessory I sent. The listing was ended as ""sold"" but I assume it fell through due to the timetable.

I called ebay and (of course) there was nothing they could do, blah blah. Regardless of the deal made in their messaging system that the rep confirmed they can see, and regardless of their attempt to resell it stating. I must accept it. 

The return was received a few days later, and it took me two days to get around to checking it/testing it - but that was too long for mr. buyer who opens a case, which is immediately decided in his favor and then paypal charges the wrong damn account to force the refund because there isn't enough of a balance so now I need to shuffle money around like an asshole.

Open the box and find that the items (he did thankfully return both) are visibly worn now, and the product's retail box looks like it's been kicked down a hallway. What does a buyer have to do to get a return refused? It feels like he could have packed the box with dog crap and still forced a refund. I'm never selling tech on Ebay again.

It's extra frustrating because I go out of my way to be a good seller. I want a win-win in every transaction and will bend over backwards to help and accommodate every person who purchases from me.

When it arrived it was clearly dropshipped -- it even had an Amazon gift receipt. However, it was still cheaper than its price on Amazon.  


How exactly is it that both me and the seller came out ahead?

Ebay,$4.99 Lingerie Account Hack(?) Purchase,"I just got an email from eBay about a purchase I allegedly made from my account that I have not used in 5 years. Apparently I activated some kind of $5 promotional code, ordered some $4.99 lingerie from China and left positive feedback with some generic broken English praise for the order. I was able to sign in and change my password/security questions without any trouble, so no real attempt was made to compromise my account other than to place this order. The seller's page has hundreds of similar orders for items worth 5 dollars/pounds/euros with nonsense positive feedback (""for you male distance runners, these are great!""- a review for the same lingerie I ""ordered"").

Is this a known scam? They've been doing this for at least 6 months, so it seems like this is a pretty effective way to skim a bunch of coupon money without actually affecting anyone enough to get shut down.",3,4,2019-08-18,EBAY,0.026522504165768623,0.9169946312904358,0.05648287013173103

Ebay,Sold a stolen item. PayPal decides I should return said stolen item to a possible thief instead of bringing it to the police.,"So a few days ago I bought a phone under the impression that it is not working and was sold for parts. When I received the phone I find that it is network blocked/ blacklisted, meaning the original owner has reported it as stolen. It came as brand new with display plastic on it might I add. 

I've had multiple iPhones stolen from me over the past couple of years. I know how much it sucks to have to use emergency family money just to buy a phone I've already worked hard for. This type of situation should end with the phone being handed straight into the police for them to investigate and deal with the situation appropriately.

From the barrage of points I made showing the seller seemed suspicious and should at least try to clear their name, their one and only response was simply ""oh I bought the phone through ebay and sold it on, just return it and I will return it to the person I bought it from.""

So me being partial, and wanting to believe that they were also sold a network blocked phone I asked if they could show me some proof from their end so I can believe at least something they said.

They simply dodged every point, did not bother to send a reply and escalated it to paypal. This was great news to me as PayPal could be partial and see what would be appropriate to do (and with something that has been stolen, wouldn't it make sense for them to at least ask me to file a police report?) and after about 7 hours out of the 30 days PayPal should take to review a case, they decided I should simply return the phone to the seller.

Return a stolen item to someone who is possibly a thief.

I haven't even got an option to send a message to PayPal or the seller through the dispute claim. Is this what PayPal has become? I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to post stolen or counterfeit goods through the UK postal service in the first place.

This is not good timing for this to be happening as I leave for holiday in just a few days.",36,47,2019-08-20,EBAY,0.14850516617298126,0.8266891241073608,0.0248057059943676

Ebay,"I unexpectedly was jailed for 2 months, my ebay account got restricted while I was unable to use the Internet for any type of personal reasons, and now I'm trying to pick up the pieces","I got locked up in county lockup for a couple months and did not have time or the wherewithal to do anything to my ebay account where I had lots of items up for sale.  I am not    complaining or whining about what happened, just looking for advice on the best way to move forward.  Over the course of the 8 weeks I was unable to use the Internet several items sold, and needless to say I never communicated with the buyers or mailed the items.  They all reported this and got full refunds, of course, which they all deserved, and several left negative reviews which were of course also completely justified.  

About a month into me not attending to my account, ebay put me some kind of restriction or suspension and removed all of my other listed items, which honestly I am glad they did so more people didn't have to go through the process of buying and then waiting and then asking for a refund.  The email said that before I could list items on ebay again I would need to basically explain to the ebay account management folks what happened, work with them on resolving the disputed cases, as well as provide the shipping codes of the items that I had sold that had gotten refunded (this part didn't really make sense since I hadn't mailed them, but whatever).

However, now that I am back it appears, as far as I can tell, that my account is totally normal and ready to go, and not actually suspended or restricted in any way that I can tell.  I have several negative reviews, but that is to be expected.  It has been about a month since ebay removed all my listings and, according to them, 'restricted' or suspended my account, and I have clicked on 'sell item' and it appears that it will let me list something and I do not see any notifications or anything of the sort calling my attention to respond to or resolve/communicate with ebay or anyone about anything.

Ebay,Sales suddenly tank?,"We think we have a fairly large eBay store with 6-7k sold every month for the past year or so. 

The past 4-5 days feel like the twilight zone. Sales have dropped almost 80%, it was common for us to wake up to quite a few things sold and now we will be lucky to make a few dollars on a sale in a day. 

I've been wondering if we somehow became shadow banned and I've looked at our store in a VPN within incognito and also through several other methods. 
Our products are still some of the top in our niche, so our listings haven't moved. 

Haz the market slowed down for anyone else the past few days? All our metrics have tanked by hundreds to thousands and we are sort of confused as we haven't changed anything... 

It seems like thousands of people suddenly stopped using eBay or they just aren't buying anything in our field.

Ebay,Ebay Gave Out My Phone Number to a Seller,"Edit: Apparently this is a common practice that I wasn’t aware of. TIL ebay reps can and will misinform you about anything. 

;dr- made a purchase with a brand new seller, he called me on the phone to tell me he shipped. He texted me a screenshot of my address and phone number from the ebay app. 

So I don't know what to do with this. When I got called it went to voicemail and I immediately called ebay, and the rep told me (rightfully so) that ebay doesn't give out phone numbers. So I called paypal. They told me the same thing. I called the post office, and they told me the same. 

I asked the guy to send me a picture of my phone number in ebay, and he did. It was on the ebay app, clear as day. 
I call ebay and the rep I spoke to asked me to email them the picture. I do, and the guy is like ""uh, yeah. Hold please."" He comes back and says he brought it up to his supervisor, who was also surprised this happened.
And then the rep said ""what sort of resolution to this would satisfy you?""

I had no idea how to respond to that. Ebay states they don't give out this sort of info, but I have irrefutable proof they did. It's not even like I would know if they ""fixed"" this. 
Who knows how many other people had their information leaked. It's not like you would know unless the other party used that info. This seller was brand new, so I'm sure he just thought it was ok to call because Ebay gave him that info. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Is there anything I should be doing, or just move on from it?",19,3,2019-08-22,EBAY,0.0393713042140007,0.9317063689231873,0.028922315686941147

Ebay,im about to leave negative feedback. on a seller.,"ordered a google pixel 3Xl description said it was in and i quote ""mint"" and ""excellent condition."" it was a little more money than the other items and i though it was worth it so i bought it. i got an email saying it shipped and i reviewed tracking number it said it was waiting to be dropped off at the post office. THE NEXT DAY i get a message from the seller saying the item has a few scratches on it and ""is that ok"" i asked where the scratches are located and why was i told in an email the date and time the item had shipped if it hadn't shipped yet. the seller then said

 "" It's on the way to you. If you don't like the condition, we will take it back for refund. please wait"" 

LOL at this point im upset already. i do not even have a phone. i am in need of one.

 so i wait all weekend to receive this phone. I RECEIVE THE PHONE on Monday its a google pixel 3 NOT a 3xl. so im UPSET it also has scratches on the SCREEN. so i tell the seller i would like to send it back i received the wrong phone. i receive a return label i get it to the post office that same Monday and get it send out. i wait alllllll week on Thursday i check the tracking its out of delivery. i check back at night to see if it was delivered, it wasn't. i call the post office the next day to see what happened. turns out the return label wasn't enough postage for the package. i contact the seller and ask will he be able to go to the post office to pick up package this is what i said....

&amp;#x200B;

""hello,  there was an issue with the package i sent to you with the phone in it. it is being held by your local post office because not enough postage was  put on the package. you can go to 10275 hole ave riverside, ca 92503-3457 and pick up the package the extra charge will be $7.40 i think she said, it was 7 and some change. if you could do that today that'd be great since i am waiting on my refund.. please let me know when you will be picking up the package so i can expect my refund thanks. heres the tracking number one more time 9400111699000894009158. thanks. ""  

this is what he says:

"" Well it says its out for delivery so as soon as we get it we will refund you ""

the package says out for delivery but thats because it couldn't be delivered the day before because of the postage....

so when this happens dont you get a slip saying "" so and so package couldnt be delivered because of postage"" so at this point he should know. 

so now he tells me he just got off the phone with the post office they will bringing it to him on monday.......... so was he just going to wait until monday the whole time???????

im upset i sent him a mean message telling him im very upset with his serivce and he will be receiving a bad review from me.

Ebay,"Wierd, never encountered this before...","I luckily stumbled across this awesome subreddit today! I have been an eBay buyer &amp; occasional seller for 10+ years, and had a strange experience this week. I had made a purchase, and the item was marked 'shipped'. Later that day, suddenly my order was cancelled &amp; the money refunded to my PayPal account. I checked later, and the seller had re-listed the same item! It was obviously not another new item from the seller, it was a one of a kind type item. I am curious if anyone else has had this happen? More importantly, should I be worried that this is some type of scam that will surprise me down the line?

Ebay,Question About Multiple Paypal Accounts,"I am helping my dad sell one of his items on my eBay store. I put the listing up for him, and I noticed that every listing has an option to send payments to a different Paypal address. 

Since his is a multiple quantity item and he plans to sell a fair amount of them over time, it is very convenient for me to attach his Paypal address to receive payment for that one listing. So I did this and it worked nicely, BUT the funds are on hold until the buyer receives the item since his Paypal account doesn't have much eBay action yet, which is fine.

So my question is this: 

Is it okay for me to continue using 2 Paypal accounts like this? One for my dad's item, and one for my items?

The reason I am asking is because I have heard some scary stories about eBay disabling accounts for various reasons, and I just wanted to make sure this is a safe practice. Thank you",15,12,2019-08-23,EBAY,0.033323366194963455,0.9302988648414612,0.03637776896357536
Ebay,Crazy buying experience,"I have to rant about what happened today.

I needed a bunch of different laptop parts, so I picked out about 5 items and put them in my cart. I checked out on the Android app (probably wasn't a good idea) and bought them all at once with the card on my account (not PayPal).

I went back a few hours later to check one of the orders, and got the message ""Order not found in our system""

All the orders were displayed in the app, but can't view order details. Check email, no confirmation emails. Check web site, orders not in purchase history.

I check the website a few hours later, all the orders are there, and say ""Payment processing."" I think something's going wrong on eBay's servers so I write down the order numbers.
Later I check again and the items have disappeared from purchase history. I check my bank account and all the charges went through. Wtf?

I call eBay, and talk to a nice Indian lady who was hard to understand. I explain the situation and she says ""No problem, I will help you with that"" then says ""I will walk you through how to order.""

No, I already paid. Then she says something about talking to my bank.

Another mistake: I used a debit card, which is much harder to get chargebacks with.

I'm PO'd at this point and have to get back to work.

After work, I call again, and get a guy on the line who understands the situation. He takes the order number I wrote down and refunds me.
Then I have to find and order everything all over again.

Ebay,Unsure about shipping item to seller for 'assessment',"A buyer here. I am not very familiar with Ebay so I am looking for some advice. I have a Sony headphones that was working fine for about 2 months until it decided to act weird (rustling/wind/popping/static noise). This issue has been occurring daily for the last 2 weeks.  

I contacted the seller and there was some delay for response as seller say that Ebay deleted part of their messages and it wasnt showing up on my inbox.

Seller now wants me to ship the item back with invoice (dont they have it?) and return reason + how to replicate issue before they decide to send a replacement.

Problem is that I can replicate this issue daily but it take some time before issue happens (it can take from 10 minutes to 3 months of use). I have recorded the noise as proof. This is discussed very extensively on Sony forums and reddit:

I am not sure if seller have the patience to wait that long to replicate the issue and might tell me there is no problem and force me to pay for shipping fee back and I am stuck with a faulty device.

Question is:
1) In the event that seller do not want to replace the device for new one,  that do I still have the option to 'return item to seller' for refund on Ebay if I shipped the item for 'assessment'?  
2) Can I start a return to seller process for refund now to avoid all these hassle?

Ebay,Mildly infuriating: seller charged $20 for Priority Mail for a few books; shipped it 3 days late and via Media Mail instead.,"I've been an active seller since 2004ish, so I get that a lot of people pad their flat shipping costs to cover materials/handling/distance, but this feels over the top. Yup, it said Priority Mail on the listing. This feels like a pure bait and switch to skim an extra $15 for the sale. And from what seemed like a reputable (3-digit feedback, 100%) seller.

I know the books would fit in a medium flat rate box ($15), and I also know the media mail from him to me costs $5. And now I get to figure out what kind of stink is worth it for a now suuuper late shipment and $15.

Ebay,Item with warranty but have no warranty?,"I recently bought a laptop on eBay with international warranty tagged onto it.

Upon receiving the item, I noticed that the keyboard of the laptop was faulty and decided to send it in for warranty. However, upon doing so, the people over at the centre said that while the warranty was valid, I needed a proof of purchase.

I have messaged the seller about it but haven't heard anything back since (4days). I have attempted to follow up after the first day but without avail.

I'm quite stuck as to what to do. On one hand, he/she was totally legitimate about claiming warranty. On the other hand, the warranty can't be claimed without a proof of purchase which the seller has to provide which means there really isn't any warranty.

What should I be doing?

Ebay,How do you change the email address/paypal payment is sent to when selling?,"I was fooling around on ebay using my personal paypal account and now I am opening a business checking account and paypal account.

So....when I sell an item in the future, how do I make sure the payment will be sent to my new, business paypal account?

If I go to my account -&gt; payment options, I can remove the old paypal account and add my new one, but this seems to be the account used when buying products.

If I go to my account -&gt; seller options -&gt; change payment method, I can change my paypal account to my new business paypal, but that seems to be which account is used to pay invoices (ebay fees)

if I go to my account -&gt; paypal options, I have the option to link a paypal account. I apparently don't have any linked right now, so I would imagine this would not be the answer to my question considering I have sold items before and received payment on my personal account.

If I got to my account -&gt; personal information -&gt; edit registered email, I can change it there but I'm not really sure if that would be the correct place or not either because it doesn't specifically say ""this is the email account that you will receive payment at"" or anything like that.

I plan on changing all of these anyway once I get my business paypal set up, but which one of these, if any, will change the paypal account my money will be sent to?

I also know I can manually change which paypal account will receive the money when creating a listing, but that's basically impractical for me to do with every single listing moving forward.

Ebay,Item not delivered because seller used different courier than advertised,"Hi

So I recently purchased an item off eBay that said it was coming from Melbourne Australia via Australia Post on the listing. For this reason I decided to purchase it and have it delivered to my Australia Post parcel locker address because I work full time and that’s where I would prefer my deliveries to go. 

They ended up shipping with another courier (Toll) who have now marked my item as undeliverable because they are not part of Aus Post. The depot is not convenient for me to get to if that was even an option. Upon review I am pretty sure the seller is actually based in China. I have messaged them and they are incredibly unhelpful.

Ebay,Buyer opens not received case 3 months later....,"Guy bought item early May and it was delivered in early May (both of us are inside the USA)

&amp;#x200B;

Some how eBay still allows him to open a not received case. It dings my paypal to negative $450.

Within the case it just gives the option to message or refund.  

&amp;#x200B;

According to eBay the listing was archived and the tracking is not visible (um, OK, so do you want the tracking again?) and eBay says it doesn't because the listing is archived and they can't do anything with the tracking.  Which I guess is why it allowed him to open the case since the tracking wasn't visible?  


They can't close out the case.

They can't release the money.  


They told me the buyer wasn't covered (obviously) but told me they can't do anything and I'll have to wait 21 days for the case to time out.

&amp;#x200B;

Did talk to American reps on the phone.  Called 3x.  Even though the case says respond in 3 days, etc like a normal case, I got a rep to send me an email in writing saying the buyer isn't covered and nothing is needed on my part.  But this is eBay, and I have concerns they'll actually stick to what they say.

Ebay,What Determines Paypal Holdings?,"I'd heard from friends that sold on Ebay recently and from others here that first time sellers have their funds held for about 30 days on Paypal.

My first sale went great ($50 usd on an offer that was slightly lower than my asking price) and it went into my paypal wallet immediately upon entering tracking as far as I can tell.

Just had my 2nd sale ($65 buy it now on an auction) and also uploaded tracking several hours ago after shipping it but it says Paypal is withholding it til Sept 12th.

I'm not mad as I understand theres probably legal reasons or just fraud preventative reasons for this policy, but it'd be nice to be able to know ahead of time whether or not money from a sale will or will not be immediately available to me. 

Is it a certain price threshold that triggers it? I know it's not based on seller's location because both of these coincidentally were going to the same relatively obscure state in the U.S. Or does it have to do with auctions vs buy it nows?

Ebay,"Just lost an auction on an item I've been looking for, for 5 years.","Absolutely gutted. This particular old vintage item never shows up probably once a year and usually in the worst condition imaginable and still ends up going for a pretty penny.

I've resolved myself to never settle for less than brilliant condition.

Lo' and behold such an item was listed 7 days ago and by god it was in the most beautiful condition I'd ever seen. Absolutely untouched, perfect working condition.

Also the seller didn't appear to realise what a gem he had so he started the bid at only 0.10c.

So I patiently waited 7 days and 23 hours before I sat down, opened a beer and got ready to throw down some serious cash. I made one tiny test bid to make sure it was even possible for me to bid on the item (you know for country restriction and other bull). Everything was fine.

As expected 40-50 seconds before the end of the auction the price absolutely shot up by hundreds. I waited until 15 seconds and I entered in what I was 100% sure would be a price no one except me would be willing to pay.

I was gob smacked to see that my bid wasn't high enough to be in the lead. So I hastily added another 50% to my initial bid which brought me into the lead. Also letting me know that my first large bid was only just barely behind the max bid of the other guy.

As the page refreshes, the final selling price is $1 higher than my max bid...

Words can't even describe. I hate, hate, hate, hate auctions! 7 days of sitting patiently and waiting and making sure I don't even make plans today in order to secure this item.

I swear I need to make a therapy group for people who lost eBay auctions in the last seconds. I seriously hate eBay's auction system. Final second bids are so annoying.

Anyway I sent the seller a message and told him if the other guy doesn't pay, I will be happy to pay. He sent me back a shocked reply saying that he had no idea the item would sell for this amount and he asked me if there was something I knew that he didn't. I said nothing except congrats and let me know if the other guy doesn't follow through on closing the deal.

Did I mention I'm gutted?",37,8,2019-08-29,EBAY,0.03360091894865036,0.910939633846283,0.055459484457969666

Ebay,Is my negative feedback justified?,"Recently made a large-ish purchase (buy it now) for around $950 after taxes.  The sale properly disclosed a long lead time.  Here's the timeline:

* 7/30: ordered, paid immediately through paypal
* 8/14-8/21: This was the estimated delivery window disclosed on the selling page
* 8/14: seller added tracking number (label created)
* 8/21: I messaged seller because the tracking still had not changed from label created.  The label had an estimated delivery window ending on 8/24, so I asked for confirmation that the item was still coming.
* 8/22: Messaged the seller at the end of the day again after they did not respond for two full days.
* 8/23: Seller responded stating that they were having issues with eBay and paypal and that I should request a refund, which would then be declined by paypal, and that I should then ask eBay to step in to issue the refund. I requested a refund the same day (item not delivered).
* 8/27: I received an e-mail from paypal saying that the eCheck (refund) payment was delayed--the seller's bank declined the charge. I contacted eBay the same day and they said to wait until 8/30 for the second attempt, at which point eBay will step in and issue a refund on the seller's behalf.  Seller sent me another message on 8/27 asking if I had asked eBay to step in on the refund yet.

I'm not worried about receiving my money since I know eBay will eventually pay me, but I'm pretty annoyed at having to do all of the legwork myself in order get my $950 back on an item that the seller clearly never had possession of.  The fact that they generated a label and let it sit for more than a week and only reached out after I was more direct in my second message to them makes me think negative feedback is justified.  I've never actually left negative feedback though and am concerned that I might receive a negative buyer feedback in response which just doesn't seem worth the hassle.",23,3,2019-08-29,EBAY,0.1784907728433609,0.7941614985466003,0.027347717434167862
Ebay,"Refunded purchase through PayPal instead of eBay, buyer opens case because he has not received it","Yes, I understand this is my mistake. It was the first time I've ever had to do a refund so I didn't know the proper way to do it. I don't believe this to be a scam, but if it is please enlighten me. I'll try to put down only the pertinent information n order to keep this concise.

&amp;#x200B;

Buyer bought and paid for product

&amp;#x200B;

Printed shipping label through eBay using the funds and transferred the rest to my bank

&amp;#x200B;

Buyer changes mind about purchase and requests for a refund through message, not resolution center. Neither of us requested any sort of cancellation at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shipping label was voided, package not sent out

&amp;#x200B;

I issue the refund through PayPal on 8/24/19 and showed as complete later on in the day

&amp;#x200B;

Went to the resolution to cancel the item via buyer request. Tried to refund and got this error: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/uU2Jc2nuP65uQeh4A](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uU2Jc2nuP65uQeh4A). I just left it figuring it would sort itself out.

&amp;#x200B;

Heard nothing from the buyer until 8/28/19 when he opened a case regarding ""did not receive item"" or something along those lines. But his message had nothing to do about receiving the product, just about not receiving his refund. I think he may not have had the option in the resolution center because I had already opened a case regarding a refund. 

&amp;#x200B;

I check the refund case I opened and am unable to issue the refund with the same error. So I try to refund him through his case, same error. We exchange messages and he's being cordial and understanding, but understandably upset. 

&amp;#x200B;

I check PayPal just a few hours ago today 8/29/19  and it looks like the refund that was completed on 8/24/19 has been reverted to ""Pending."" I try to refund him through his case again with the same error. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's pretty much everything that's happened so far. I looked up my problem and it seems like it's quite a common problem across many forums. People who call PayPal customer service tell them to call eBay, people who call eBay customer service tell them to call PayPal.

About a week and a half in I noticed some of my “Buy It Now” listings were available for offers, even though I listed them as only BIN.

Called ebay, after an hour of back and forth and on hold, with the ebay representative, she finally told me that her co-workers told her that this is because of a new ebay rule. She told me ebay is now having any listing that’s over 8 days old, open to offers. I told her I don’t want that for my listings, and she said that is the new policy for listings over 8 days. Is this true? Because after I repeatedly asked her why my listings were changed to accept offers without my consent, she didn’t and wouldn’t answer my question until an hour into our call. She seemed really confused. I even tried to change the best offer listings to only BIN, and it would not let me revise. I asked the ebay employee about that too &amp; she said I could revise.

Ebay,Beware: Dynamic Currency Conversion when paying for foreign auctions.,"I know this has been discussed before but since this just happened on eBay, and several times on my recent vacation, I thought it would be worth repeating. 

I just bought an item out of Australia, auction was in Australian dollars. After my winning bid eBay offered to let me pay in USD, the amount seemed a bit high compared to what my currency conversion app told me (I had researched my max price in AUD before bidding) so I checked out exchange rate for the winning bid. Sure enough, the amount it presented was about 3.6% higher due to a crappy exchange rate commonly known as Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC). Not that much, I have seen some has high as 15%-25% at ATM's but I was surprise to see eBay getting in on this way of skimming off the top of foreign transactions. I was able to change my payment to AUD with a credit card that has no foreign transaction fees and sure enough the amount charged to my card was $40 less than what EBay/PayPal offered! Remember, always pay in the local currency, and use a card with no foreign transaction fees! Visa/MC will almost always give you the best exchange rate. 

The double scummy thing about the DCC is that even if I had paid in USD, most credit cards would have still charged you the 3% foreign transaction fee on top! So it would have been a double whammy.

Ebay,A couple of questions about eBay's automatic sales tax collection.,"Hiya!  I've been reading a bunch of threads here after being VERY confused from this eBay article:

https://www.ebay.com/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/taxes-import-charges?id=4121

My first question is simply this; is that completely outdated information?  It is my understanding that eBay is now completely taking on the responsibility of collecting sales tax from buyers and paying the buyer's state and the seller doesn't have to do anything.  That's correct, yes?

Second question is maybe not as simple (since it probably varies by state) but what about items that you're not reselling?  For example; If I am selling my 2 year old TV because I don't want it anymore.  To the best of my knowledge, selling of personal items does not require collection of sales tax...does eBay still collect sales tax on that item?  If so, and if I'm correct about personal item sells not requiring sales tax, then...what in the world does one do about that?

Thanks very much!!",8,4,2019-08-30,EBAY,0.0360550656914711,0.9242603182792664,0.03968464955687523

Ebay,Missing Parcel from Bulgaria refused refund,"I bought an expensive coat from a Bulgarian seller back in July. They told me it would take over a month to arrive here in the U.K. which I thought was strange but waited as instructed. They gave me a Bulgarian tracking number which I couldn’t use so I waited for the arrival date. Expected arrival date came and went so I messaged requesting a Royal Mail tracking number. The seller didn’t respond but uploaded one into the system that was incorrect and untraceable. I messaged again pointing this out but had no response. 

I opened a case with eBay requesting the correct details but the same day the seller entered a valid tracking number and eBay closed the case with no refund and no tracking details. I had to call customer services and they gave me a new tracking number which was valid and stated that my parcel had been delivered 3 weeks ago yet there was no signature or proof except what their system says. Even if they had the parcel it was too late for it to be redelivered as the seller had made me wait for over a month.

I had a bad feeling about this when I saw the weirdly long waiting time as I’ve ordered things from Asia which took less time. Royal Mail have said its up to the seller to make a claim and refund me but 1. They’re in Bulgaria and 2. Haven’t responded to any messages for a month so aren’t willing to help me. 

Is there anything I can do? I’ve lost nearly £100 and I’m quite upset that EBay refuse to help as i was under the impression that there was a money back guarantee. I’m disabled and had to save up a long time to buy that coat so it’s quite upsetting feeling I’ve been ripped off :(",6,26,2019-08-31,EBAY,0.06163764372467995,0.905132532119751,0.033229801803827286
Ebay,Missing return - eBay refuses to refund,"Hello guys,

I sold a Galaxy S10 on eBay and shipped it to the buyer. It was brand new and still in the plastic, never turned on. However, because the seal of the box had been opened to verify all the contents, the buyer opened a return request which I declined. He then escalated and eBay sided with him.

eBay sent him a return shipping label without informing me of the tracking number or asking me to confirm anything. Anyways, the item never got delivered back to me because the return address they used was wrong but eBay went ahead and refunded the buyer even though they said the refund would only happen after the item had been delivered back to me. 

In the process of returning the item back to the buyer, USPS misplaced the item. Apparently, eBay didn't insure the item (I always insure the item) so an item I sold for $720 is now missing and not insured. I'm apparently out of both my item and my money.

I've called eBay a bunch of times and only get the Philippines customer service desk who are the most unhelpful CS I've ever dealt with. It seems they're completely unauthorized to do anything (including the managers). Please is anyone aware of how to contact eBay US customer service or how I can escalate this further?
