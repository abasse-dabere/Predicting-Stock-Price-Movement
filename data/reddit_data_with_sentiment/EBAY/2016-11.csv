Ebay,Buyer claims he wanted to buy different item? (Phone),"I sold my Droid Turbo on eBay and the buyer made me an offer, to which I accepted. He immediately paid through PayPal and then started sending me questions. 

Asked if I had the manual, I said no, but e-mailed him a PDF. Asked if it was waterproof. I e-mailed him an article about it's water resistance.  Asked me if it was a Droid Turbo or a Droid Turbo 2. Told him it was a Droid Turbo.

He said he wished he hadn't bought it because he could get a Droid Turbo 2 for that price ($175 shipped). I told him that the phone was in excellent condition and I think we both got a good deal. The Verizon rep told him today that the phone wasn't worth it, so he messaged me again to complain. Didn't say he specifically wanted money, but that he did a search, and shouldn't have paid more than $150, and he could have gotten a Droid Turbo 2 for $175.

I wrote him back and said I felt badly that he misread the listing but I in no way misrepresented the item being sold. Hoping that he doesn't try to file a claim, for whatever reason. Anyone else ever experience this?",13,7,2016-11-01,EBAY,0.03619076684117317,0.9246723055839539,0.039136867970228195

Ebay,I won an auction. Seller canceled my sale (told me OOS) and shortly thereafter sold it for $50 more to someone else.

I looked at the seller's completed items and saw that he listed the identical item (#282240130683) shortly thereafter for $50 more and accepted a Best Offer on it at 6:16 p.m. 
I believe he received a better offer and decided to cancel my sale and take the higher offer. I called eBay and was told they would look into it. What I really want is the item -- it's the first one to come up on eBay in 5 months. Grrrr, I'm so mad.

Ebay,Ebay seller is now an unregistered user and the purchased goods has a window up until December 22nd to arrive. Need suggestions/help.,"Hello r/Ebay,

Apparently, my dad won a bid from a sketchy seller. We thought at first that it could be someone trying to start a business. However, a few hours after paying (via paypal), the user is no longer registered and the shipping page cannot be accessed anymore. Now, I did a couple of searches and I found out (and please correct me if I am wrong) that I can only submit a item not received report to ebay a week after the stated delivery date has passed. 

That said, since it is not going to be more than a month before the expected delivery date, which is December 22nd, Am I wasting time for not submitting a report on Ebay (or even on Paypal) since the user already did something comparable to a scam? Also, what if the user withdraws the funds that I have transferred on his account via paypal, will I still be able to get it back (refund)? 

Thanks in advance! Any help would be greatly appreciated!",2,1,2016-11-01,EBAY,0.05848776549100876,0.884948194026947,0.056563980877399445
Ebay,So happy with EBAY customer Service's decision today,"12 days ago, I get a message from the buyer claiming the item is a lot smaller than she thought, and the colors are completely different "" THEN"" ( sorry my pet peeve) the pictures.

I told her I put the measurements in the listing but she can return the item for refund. 

her response was "" I do not have means to return it""

me "" I can offer you $5 partial refund""

her "" I want 50% refund."" ( the item was over $50) , "" I want 100% refund before I send it back"" ( I thought she did not have means to send it back?)

Before I had the chance to respond to her unreasonable suggestions, she opens a INAD case saying "" not worth the $50 I paid for this incredibly stupid little thing"" etc

I called ebay, I was told to accept the return. I told them I am not paying for return shipping. rep says"" I will make sure you do not have to pay the shipping. ""she tells me to accept the return, and then when I got to the next screen where there were 3 options, - send the label, - already bought the label, ( I cannot remember the last option) she told me to not choose any. the rep closed the case in buyer's favor. then opened the case on my behalf asking the buyer  to ship the item back within 10 days.

I received a few messages from the buyer that day using an F word, when I will be sending the label, when she will get her money back etc, I told her to look into the case details.

10 days have passed. I called and they closed the case. 
I also pointed out that I do not agree that there is a defect on my account because of this and they reversed the decision in my favor.

Ebay,Best way to respond to a fraudulent return request,"What is the best way to respond to a buyer you know is blatantly attempting to scam you?

A buyer opened a return request for ""missing parts or pieces"" and uploaded a photo of something completely unrelated to what was packed for shipping claiming he received that instead of what he purchased.  His words: ""...I didn't receive item X.  Please refund accordingly"" which could be taken as he is asking for a partial refund for the missing item instead of a full refund for the return of everything.  I have not yet figured that out and have a couple days before I ultimately need to accept the return.

For some more context, the buyer purchased a set of aftermarket car parts from me, which I personally packed and shipped.  The item the buyer uploaded a picture of is something I don't even stock in my warehouse, along with packing materials I didn't use.  

Unfortunately, I know this means little to eBay.  The company line is they are just the middleman, are not there when the contents are packed and are therefore unable to take my word and that I should write this off as the cost of doing business.  The cynic in me wants to respond to the buyer that I will be accepting the return under protest since the picture he uploaded is of something I do not carry, and I know he received everything pictured in the listing.  

I'm wondering if there might be a better response, better questions I might ask in order to get the buyer to admit his wrongdoing.  My frustration is affecting my judgment, so maybe someone smarter has a better idea.",10,2,2016-11-04,EBAY,0.1078285351395607,0.8611397743225098,0.031031683087348938

Ebay,HUGE SCAMMER : he returned an empty package,"Hello, 

This post is the development of this one :

[LINK TO THE ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/57vgs0/buyer_claimed_the_board_was_damaged_but_hes_using/)

Long story short : 

*I sold on eBay a $2400 skateboard. The buyer claimed that he received it with a scratch on it. I agreed on the return (money back guarantee) only if he didn’t use it but he told me that he did.* 

*Then I filed a dispute and eBay decided to tip the scale in his favor. I called them a million times saying that in their policies we couldn’t return something used and that he just damaged it while riding it. But they didn’t want to hear anything so I paid for the return (I sent him twice the return fees and he didn’t refund me yet…) or else i’d have lost both my board and the money.*

And today I received the board : there was nothing but a weight and some clothes in the package… I know I screwed up by not filming me taking the package from the UPS delivery guy. I took some pictures right away. 

I’m scared it won’t be enough and that eBay will refund him. I really don’t want to loose this case, I’m tired of this situation. 

When i sent the board, he gave me a fake address (i checked on google), he changed the delivery to a UPS store right after I sent the tracking number. 

But i found his real one and all his social media accounts.

Ebay,Seller cancelled my auction winning bid. How can I do anything about this.,"So I bid and won on a 700+ bid and the seller instantly cancelled the order claiming it was out of stock or broken. I know he didn't want to sell for that low and that's why he did it. I know little 99cent winning bids there's not much you can do but this is a big purchase and there should be more legal action I can take since it is a binding contract.

He claimed it was broken by his nephew that night. Should I ask him for a picture of the broken laptop ?

Ebay,Seller selling possibly fake item with pictures of original very rare collectors item.,"I was recently browsing ebay for very rare collectors item. I found the item but pictures and description seems weird to me. The guy who listed this item, sold similar item two or three months ago with exactly the same description and pictures. Pictures of this item showed major defects and discoloration which are pretty good signs of that the item is genuine and old. However. These items are all unique and I can almost guarantee there's no two alike.

I proceeded to email the seller about this and addressed my concerns about the matter and asked if he could update the pictures since the pictures he has on his listing are not accurate representation which he has to offer. The seller emailed me back the next day saying he sells **""only original items guaranteed!""** He didn't address any of my concerns about pictures being possibly obsolete, my interest about this item because of its coloration (the item is normally different color but this one had unique coloration) or even the condition.

I politely asked him to upload new pictures since how could I base my decision on pictures which are not even taken of the item. He didn't upload any new pictures. That makes me think that he's way to rich to care about over hundred bucks or he doesn't want to upload new pictures because he's probably selling either fake item or similar item but in different condition and using the picture of original item as a bait. Also worth mentioning is that almost all the other listing of this item disclose under ""condition"" tab ""as in pictures"". This listing doesn't tell anything about condition. All those other listing claim to sell original item but they are all fake by the looks of it.

If I report this person, is it going to be taken seriously since I haven't bought the item and I can't know for sure until I see it with my own eyes (at least ebay would think like this if they have no idea about this field of interest. Any **experienced** collector however would agree with what I just said above). Also is it allowed to list item as ""real 100% genuine not fake!"" if it's clearly just a copy and costs only fraction of what the real one would cost? I'm not familiar with ebay's policies about this matter. I don't want people to get tricked into buying some fake item because seller has obsolete pictures. Tell me your thoughts about this matter and would it be wise to report this person or would ebay consider it as report function's abuse? Would this get him banned?

Edit: Someone left positive feedback less than 6 months ago on his profile. It displays the same name for the listing under the user's message and when I clicked on the ""view item"" it took me to the listing that was sold. It had same photos, same description, same listing name and same price. Only difference was that this one had bidding enabled when the current listing is ""buy now"" only. This indicates someone really bought it, paid for it and was happy with the item. If the buyer had returned the item, I don't believe he would have left positive feedback. I should have included this in my post but I forgot.

**TLDR:** Seller uses same photos for unique item he used for similar item in the past which has been sold and don't want to upload updated pictures which makes me think he might try to sell fake or copy of the original item.",11,5,2016-11-07,EBAY,0.07901627570390701,0.8950311541557312,0.025952545925974846

Ebay,Do you guys offer in-person support to scammers? I did.,"I was just thinking of this today for some reason. Reddit likes short, so I'll be swift.

I sold an i7-3770k Intel Processor on eBay a few months back. Perfect chip, I was using it every day since new and I decided to upgrade. I carefully removed it, took pics, packaged it, and then listed it.

Sold it to a local guy (by chance). I really needed the money to offset my spending on the new machine, and I'm not a big time eBay seller. He got it and used the ONLY way to get out of paying for it. He tells me it's DOA. I know it can't be DOA.. he must have mis-diagnosed his machine or something and the CPU didn't fix it.

So I said to him ""Hey, I see you live in so-and-so, and I'm only 15 miles away. If you like, I can come to your place and get it working"".

Well.. that must've flustered him.. 2 days later I get a reply, akin to ""Oh I'll keep it that won't be necessary.. Something else must be wrong with my computer""

Ebay,Triangulation Scam,"OK so maybe I'm making a big deal about nothing, but this shit seems fishy and I'm not sure what to do.  

I placed an order on eBay for *fitness tracker* Friday.  Got the tracking number Saturday, it arrived today.  Super fast shipping, brand new in box just like the description said.  

Here's the rub, the box was shipped to me directly from *major cell phone carrier* not the eBay seller.  OK, nbd, guy probably just drop shipped it.  Problem is, the amount on the invoice is around $50 more than I paid for it (~$80).  Seems strange someone would loose money on purpose since it was a buy it now transaction on eBay.  Also my name and address were down as both the shipping and BILLING address.  Strange.  

So I emailed the seller asking him what's up, he says not to worry, he's legit, and it's just a difference of retail vs wholesale cost.  Not satisfied with his answer, I called up *major cell phone carrier* told them what was going on, they verified that my contact info was what they had for the order (I didn't order from them) and the email was bogus.email.with.my.last.name@yahoo.com.  after hearing the email address I was sure this was fraudulent, but the cell carrier wasn't convinced.  They say they were paid, and I got what I paid for, so nbd don't worry about it.

My concern is that in the coming days they're going to get a cc charge back and then try and bill me for what I've already paid for... Any ideas on what I should do?

TL;DR: pretty sure I received exactly what I ordered, but that it was paid for by the seller using a stolen cc, then drop shipped to me conveniently with only my contact info.

Ebay,Habitual Ebay scammer on the loose. What to do?,"There's this one buyer on Ebay that has scammed several people, again and again with the same techniques. 

He buys expensive items, swaps out the content, and opens up a SNAD case against the seller. If not that, then he opens up a item not received (if the tracking system doesn't work or hasn't registered a delivery), or in worst case destroys the item and returns it against cash. Some ~~buyers~~ sellers have gotten their money back, others have lost their case. 

This buyer has a pattern of buying lots of cheap stuff to build up reputable feedback, and then steals expensive stuff from smaller sellers. He's been going at it like this for over a year, with sellers reporting him to ebay, paypal and the police. But nothing happens. 

The buyer doesn't seem to re-sell the stuff either, just keeps it (high end clothing / shoes / etc.)...what can be done? I've contacted every other seller to report this scumbag, in case they forgot or just figured they'd eat the loss and ban the buyer.

EDIT: It should be noted that I'm located in Norway, and sold this through ebay international/global. All the other sellers are Americans located in America. And at least one of them have filed a police report. 

UPDATE: So I'm starting to get more information, and he's given at least 3 different names and addresses to 3 different sellers (that he scammed) the pat 6-12 months.

Ebay,Seller Lodging a Complaint About Me,"I've just been informed by a seller that they are going to lodge a complaint about me and I'm wondering what I can do since I think it is completely unjustified and if anything he is in the wrong.

So this is what happened. The Seller failed to sell an item at auction twice, I messaged him saying I'd be happy to buy it for a bit less than the auction price. He agreed but then tried to move the sale outside of eBay. I said no cause it's against policy. He said that I'd have to add the $50 in eBay fees to my offer then. I begrudgingly agreed to compromise and added $25 to my offer. He then added a buy it now but also changed the auction price to $150 less than before. I stupidly thought this was because he thought he'd get a better offer through an auction and so I decided to risk it and put a bid on. He is not happy about this (fair enough) as he said he had to put a low auction price as it had to be 30% lower than the buy it now and he said he would not allow the auction to end at $300. I apologised and explained the misunderstanding and told him to cancel cause I couldn't 'buy it now' after I had bid. He then replied saying he'd have to lodge a complaint otherwise he'd get fined.

I understand that it was a dumb mistake to bid on the auction (although he could have explained to me before he did it). However he is the one who tried to break eBay policy by trying to take the sale off eBay even after I told him it was against policy. 

My question is what is the likely outcome of his complaint and is there anything that I should do?

Ebay,Picture of the item does not match the item's tech specs,"Basically, the item in question has two versions, the old one that was released in 2009, and the newer version that was released just over a year ago.  The picture in the listing shows the more recent and updated version.  The title of the listing just indicated the ""brand name"" and the ""model name"" of the item.  The description did not mention whether it was the old or the newer version.  It basically just provided information on the item such as the UPC, product code (very similar codes between the two versions - new version has an additional digit), etc. - information that is not readily apparent and would require one to research further.  There are both functional and physical improvements on the newer version, thus making the difference between the two versions really matter.

The price I paid (it was a BIN listing) was 'only' about 20% less than the actual MSRP of the newer version.   So it wasn't really a red flag that there is deception attempt going on.  The price I paid is a little bit more than the MSRP of the older version, and have I known that it was the older version, I would not have purchased from the seller.

Based on the above, do I have a case of INAD against the seller?",7,4,2016-11-09,EBAY,0.03340201824903488,0.9314044713973999,0.03519345819950104

Ebay,"UPDATE on buyer returning ""defective"" item and leaving neg feedback when item was actually fine.","Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/59irnr/buyer_returned_an_item_claiming_it_was_defective/).

tl;dr: Guy bought a GPS from me, returned it a month later and gave me negative feedback claiming it was defective. Upon return, item works perfectly.

I called eBay and they agreed to remove the negative feedback. Looking through the transaction, they noticed the buyer admit in a message that they had the device for over a month and that during that time it had been transported to Peru. Further transport of an item invalidates eBay's buyer protection policies, and thus I as the seller was no longer responsible for it ""not working"".

However, since I had already accepted the return and refunded the buyer, they could not change anything about the return shipping charges I had to pay. They said I could report the buyer and they'd look into him. Le sigh. Okay, done.

So it's a favorable outcome I guess, but it's important to note that they didn't remove my neg feedback because the buyer lied. They removed it because the neg was about a condition that I was no longer responsible for, since the buyer didn't report it broken until after they had already transported it father themselves.

Despite having my neg removed and getting my item back (since relisted and resold), this experience has done nothing to alleviate my bad feelings towards eBay. Lesson learned!",3,3,2016-11-09,EBAY,0.6379855871200562,0.32988715171813965,0.03212723135948181

the messages he sent me go along like this:
Buyer: The oval is a fake. I will be returning it for a refund, if you choose not to refund my money I will take this to small claims court.

Me:
i would advise against that, since i already told you and it is stated in the listing that i do not offer returns. best of luck

buyer: Not offering a return is not a defense for selling a reproduction in an original listing on eBay. I would advise you to refund my money and I will return the oval.

Ebay,I need some help as a buyer. I'm not sure if I've been refunded or not.,"Okay, this makes me seem like such a noob, but I've been buying and selling on eBay for over ten years. Please forgive me. 


On October 28th, I won an auction. The total was just under fifty bucks. It was an okay deal for me, but not crazy under priced. I expected to spend about 10-15 more dollars to win. A couple days later, the seller marked as shipped but didn't upload a tracking number. A day after that he messaged me stating that the shipping was almost double what he expected and he would still ship it if I wanted, but would like to see if I would agree to a refund. I did agree to just get a refund cause I understand shit happens. 


It's important to note that when I paid for this auction I was having difficulties using PayPal on my iPad so I used the eBay checkout thing and not PayPal. I never used this way to pay before.


Now he says he refunded me this money on Monday. He has close to 200 recent selling transactions, all with positive feedback, so I don't think he's scamming me for fifty dollars. But the item in the purchase history still has the dollar sign and shipped icons lit up. And he said he refunded from his PayPal account to mine, which I'm not sure if that's how it works when I used the eBay checkout. I did checkout under my account, not as a guest.


I guess what I'm asking is, is there anywhere else I should look for this refund? Should I give it more time to clear back to my debit card?

Ebay,Very confusing situation,"So I sold a ps2 with a wired controller, 2 memory cards, 2 games, the power wire, and NO a/v wire (which was listed in the description and shown to not have one in pics). 

The buyer received it and initiated a refund saying that he only received one memory card and that the controller doesn't work. He only wants a partial refund. 

I know for a fact I put two memory cards in the package, one in the game case slot and one loosely wrapped in bubble wrap. For the controller, me and a friend were playing the game I sold literally the day before I shipped it out. 

What do I do in this situation?

Ebay,"I bought a Iphone 7 Plus, got a Moto G4..","I bought a Brand NEW still in the plastic Iphone 7 Plus  128gb Verizon Matte Black for $950+shipping, seller stated that the item would be shipped within 2 days of payment. I quickly pay on Oct 29, 2016 and  the seller ships the phone on 11/04/2016 and I get it on 11/12/2016. 
My mother opens the box and sends me a picture of a Moto G4, I call my mom to ask if that was the phone inside the box and she says yes.
Looking through the listing, I notice that seller had a clear picture of the IMEI and Serial Number. I Apple Support the serial number and find out that the phone was activated on 11/10/2016 when it was in the USPS truck/USPS possession.  
Ebay message the seller asking her if she might have sent the wrong phone(who knows it can happen) she said no and said I was scamming her and she didn't know what I was talking about. She was accusing me of changing the phone. Thats when I told her that the phone was activated 2 days prior before the phone was delivered to my address. 
Since then no communication. I'm not a detective, but have 2 theories on what might have happened..
1) Someone from USPS stole it, but why would they replace it with another phone
2) The seller switched it and is accusing me of trying to scam her

I called Ebay provided all the proof I had, tracking info, photo of the phone I recieved, screen shot of the imei and serial number from the sellers listing, screen shot from apple support showing that the phone was activated on 11/10/2016 and has warranty until 11/10/2017. And explain to them my 2 theories, they say they will investigate

My question is what else can I do to show/prove I'm the one being scammed by the seller, or USPS stole my phone and replaced it with a Moto G4.

Ebay,Quick Kinda Newbie Question.,"I am WAY down on my luck and sold some Nintendo DS and GBA games..each sale was about 53 dollars.

I have sold on Ebay before, but the last time before these two sales was in 2013. I have only 33 feedback but all positive.

So first buyer pays, the money gets put on hold, come off of hold the next night and I use part of that to ship his items, he gets them today.

Second buyer does not pay till 48 hours after the sale and then Pay Pal put that in hold but here it is, way after when they cleared the last one and it is still on hold.

I used the balance of the first sale to pay off my net or I would not be online. 

So my query is why is this second amount being held for a longer period? I cannot ship because I literally have 48 cents to my name and I thought it would clear at the same rate of time or thereabout.

I sent a message to buyer explaining this, because I am not trying to rip anyone off here at all, just flat broke and that is why I was selling in the first place.

I also used it to pay the ebay fees with a one time payment...

Anyone know why the hold time would differ like that and also, is there anything I can do to expedite the procedure? 

Will calling PayPal do any good?

Ebay,Ebay system failures and lack of accountability.,"Just needed to vent for a second. Had a couple eBay moments in the last month or so.

1.  Ebay's system messed up on attaching multiple items to the same tracking. On several orders. Normally it combines tracking unless you tell it otherwise: despite several agents either not knowing or lying about it so because of their system error....which one tech finally admitted, my stupid shipping quota which in turn affects my seller rating which affects my fees and promotion....goes south. 

Ok, well, I think, it's their mistake surely they will fix it. NOPE. They can't do anything. They don't even try to do anything. So they make a system which penalizes sellers for not uploading the tracking in time, their system fails to show the tracking, I am penalized.  

2. When they forced everyone to transition to UPCs their stupid system wouldn't take on a number of our items....so I think ok, fine. I guess it doesn't need/want it for these items and since I've wasted hours trying to apply these UPCs I'm going to leave it alone. And now, some months later, the items just aren't renewed - no warning! I lose all the sales rankings and watchers and have to relist them.

I believe neither of these two vendors accept returns normally, so not sure if that changes things

Thanks!

(An extra question which I hope doesn't distract from above is how soon does ebay update that my return has shipped? I left it at the postal office this morning around 9:30am with the ebay printed shipping label and the site hasn't updated that it's shipped...)",6,4,2016-11-16,EBAY,0.027317937463521957,0.919978141784668,0.052703991532325745
Ebay,Tested Wii game not working on my console,"Hi r/ebay,

I recently bought a bundle of two Wii games (Super Smash Bros and Super Mario Galaxy) from a seller. The item description says that the games have been tested and work, albeit with some wear and scratches. It is also listed as ""Good"" condition. Super Mario Galaxy works fine and I would say is accurately described. Smash Bros Brawl, on the other hand is very scratched and has a lot of wear. My Wii was unable to read the game disc. 

I contacted the seller explaining the problem, but was basically told that the game was tested and worked on their system. The seller suggested I buy a DVD lens cleaner kit. I don't think that me buying a cleaning kit is a reasonable solution. How should I go forward? Should I ask the seller for a partial refund and/or open a case?

Ebay,Sold a £1000 electronics item (new &amp; sealed) to a buyer in Italy who I've just realised has no feedback.,"I had two offers from Italian buyers and conflated them in my head - turns out this guy has no feedback and is sending messages exclusively in Italian.

I have a bad feeling in my gut about this, but I'm finding it hard to see how he could get me. Theoretically if he received it and reported it as broken, would Ebay/Paypal refund him if he sent me a box of rocks back, considering I've set it to no refunds? I'd really appreciate some guidance now as I can't afford to be scammed on this one.

Ebay,Constant scammers making selling impossible,"I'm new to selling on eBay, and scammers have made the site impossible to use.

I create a new ""Buy it now"" listing, and within an hour or so it has sold, for the asking price. I then get a request for an invoice, and the buyer asks for my Paypal address. Of course the buyer is a scammer, or has been hacked, and I never get paid. So I report and block the user, re-list the item, and within an hour or so another scammer has bought it.

This has happened literally every time I have tried to sell something!

A couple of points -- I don't have a premier Paypal account, so can't set up immediate payment on checkout. Also, some of the phoney buyer accounts are 10+ years old, with positive feedback, so blocking users with no feedback won't help.

Does anybody have any idea how I can fix this? Because for the moment, eBay is utterly broken!

Edit: Thanks for the help everyone! The answer of course is to get a Business or Premier Paypal account, which will allows immediate payment to be required at checkout. 

However, if (like me) you're not a business, then to convert your Personal Paypal account into a Premier, you'll need to close your account and then re-open it as a Premier account -- it can't be upgraded. 

And also, if like me you fly into an apoplectic rage because the ""Immediate payment"" option is *still* not available, then you have to calm down, start a brand new listing, and select the advanced editor, and it'll be there.",16,12,2016-11-17,EBAY,0.034603461623191833,0.9298668503761292,0.03552970290184021

Ebay,Ever gotten scammed by a seller? Here's one way of getting scammed.,"I just went through a painstaking process of retrieving money that I'd been scammed of and I thought I'd share my story. Bear with me as it's not short. 

I've been on a lookout for an upgrade on my phone for a while now. Since I currently don't live in North America, getting a traditional upgrade wasn't a proper way to go. 

I headed over to Apple site. They've got a brand new (and unlocked) 128 GB iPhone7 listed for nearly $800. 

I thought I'd try to find an alternative route and after a few tries, managed to retrieve my ebay login credentials (hadn't used ebay in 3 years). 

After a couple unsuccessful bids, I kept looking. 

And voila. $500 for a brand new iPhone 7. What's more, it was factory unlocked that could be used in Nepal! I paid immediately using my credit card. 

The seller wouldn't provide me any shipping details. 

I had made the purchase on Oct 30 (paid instantly). I had to wait till Nov 9 to launch a case against this guy. There were a few red flags already. He hadn't provided me shipping details. He'd never sold anything prior to it. Also, $500 did sound way too good to be true. But even then, I took the plunge because my cc does provide protection against theft. 

Following my filing, he responded with tracking info. To my utter surprise, the item (according to tracking number) had been shipped on the 1st and delivered on the 4th! 

Since I'm not in the US, I kept pestering my family to go through mails from previous week. I also had them go to the post office with tracking info but USPS kept insisting the package had been left inside the mail box! We were all confused. 

I then tried contacting ebay but they kept asking me to wait till the 15th before I could file an appeal. 

Now here's where it gets real interesting. The phone was located in Gretna, Nebraska according to the listing. The origin of the shipment (according to the tracking number) was an Amazon warehouse in Tennessee! That kept bothering me coz I don't think anybody dropships a brand new iPhone. I called amazon in between and wanted to check if they'd have a way to tell me what was inside the package (seller kept ignoring my request to send IMEI number). But nope. No luck. 

On the 15th, I filed for a review and I was advised I'd hear back within 30-45 mins. Unbelievably, they ruled the case in favor of the seller within 15 mins. I was outraged and baffled! 

Unsatisfied, I picked up the phone and called them. They kept insisting that I wasn't entitled to an IMEI number (I paid for it and I'd already lost the case, how could they have denied me the right to know details about the product I'd purchased and paid for!?!)

I had the call escalated to fraud department (I think). The lady kept insisting that tracking info provided by seller and USPS' confirmation left them with no choice. However, she offered me a one-time courtesy full refund. All I had to do was file a case on a government site against Internet crime (IC3.gov), take screenshots/pictures and I'd be refunded my money. 

I followed the directions and they immediately sent me confirmations about the process. 

Amused and still unsatisfied, I decided to dig deeper and had a family member file another case at the USPS center. After 2 days, the supervisor found out that the seller had made a mistake and sent the phone to a wrong address (same city and zipcode). 

It all started to make sense. But still, there were some doubts. Since the refund was already processed, I thought there was no point of dwelling over the transaction. 

However, after a few hours of the revelation (about package being shipped to wrong address), it all started making sense. 

The scammer had shipped something to the wrong address off amazon. He had performed his 'duties' properly. Sent a package timely. The package had been delivered. Transaction was flawless from his stance. 

I picked up the phone and called ebay again to notify them of the 'wrong address' and I'm convinced the scammer isn't gonna get away with $500 he thought he'd earned so easily. 

Out of sheer curiosity, I've asked my family to go to the 'wrong' address (1 mile from the 'real address' and see what was delivered).

I spent few hours doing research on a way to combat an issue like this in which a package had gone missing (left inside the box) and everybody kept insisting ebay kept ruling the case in seller's favor. I'm damn sure a number of innocent people have been scammed in this manner.",25,10,2016-11-19,EBAY,0.22928672283887863,0.7332243025302887,0.037488965317606926

https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/5d12gs/very_confusing_situation_continued/

In short, they claim 1 of 2 memory cards were not received, plus the controller didn't work. They asked for a partial refund. I explained how the items were packaged and how the items were tested before shipment. 

The items are received, and a day later the buyer initiates a return based on INAD. We are 6 days in, and the buyer has yet to respond to any of my 3 messages. I have opened a case for the buyer not responding to any of the messages. 

This is a classic way to scam for a partial refund (buyer's remorse in my opinion for this instance specifically). So, here we go again with yet another example of how ludicrous it is that sellers aren't allowed to leave anything but positive feedback for buyers. Hopefully eBay closes this case soon so that the money isn't held up any longer.

Ebay,This is kind of weird.,"So a while ago I made a post about an item I had bought but hadn't been shipped to me.


To make the story short I pre-ordered a Japanese item in early September just says before its released. The seller is based in California so they had to import from Japan and then ship to me. 



On the 20th of October I message the seller asking why my item hasn't been shipped.



They explain to me that they import once a month from Japan and that something had gone wrong with their last import. They then said that I wouldn't receive my item until mid/late-November (almost a month after the original delivery date)




I opened a thread here asking for advice and if it was unreasonable to ask for a return. You guys said that it wasn't unreasonable at all. When I try to open up a claim on Oct.27th it tells me that I can't. The expected delivery date was Oct.20th-31st so I can't do it until after the 31st. So I decide to wait.




---- this is what happened after ----




For a while I completely forget about the package. Then on Friday, Nov 4th I message them again. I wanted to make sure that my package wasn't ready for shipment before filing the claim because I was still interested in the item. 



They write back the same day but I don't see it until Thursday, Nov 10th. In their response they basically tell me: ""Your item will be shipped out next week. If not next week then the following week.""


That same day I write back and tell them that I'd like a refund if they haven't already shipped it. I also open up a claim on eBay. Up until this point they had been responding to my messages within hours. This time they don't write back until Monday the 14th. In their message they apologize for not responding to the message sooner and tell me that they had already shipped the item then give me the tracking numbers.


I keep the claim open just in case and notice that the item had JUST been shipped. There isn't even any information on it. When the tracking updates on Wednesday the 16th I notice that the package is coming from New York which strikes me as odd because the eBay seller is based in California.


Finally the package arrives in the mail today and its even better quality than I had expected. But here is the weird thing: I did some research and the package comes from a pretty BIG online store based in New York. It didn't come from the eBay seller. They sent me some free stickers and the package slip comes from that shop as well so I know that the eBay seller didnt just reuse the box.


I ordered the item on eBay Sept. 1st.
The order from this store was made on Nov.10th (the day I asked for a return)



My total on eBay came up to $80.90
The total from that NY store came up to $81.80 (so the seller lost almost $1)



I don't know how to feel about this. ...

Ebay,"Buyer has a problem with bad item, a little advice, please?","I bought an electronic keyboard, a pretty good one, heavy. Seller said it is in excellent condition. Upon arrival, I learn it has several bad keys. Seller says he is very sorry, it was fine when he shipped it, though I don't believe it. He wants shots of the box, and probably hopes to claim shipping damage. The box looks okay to me, though he did a bad job of packing it. Seller also wants photos of the bad keys. The look only a little funny in the photo. I wonder if seller will claim there is nothing wrong with it.

Seller has a good history, but only seven sales. I guess I can either ask him to refund most of my money, or return the item and ask for a total refund.

If I return the item and get a refund, does he pay me after he receives the item, or does he pay me before I ship it?

The return shipping will be about $40, it's going to require expensive new shipping materials, and I don't want to pack it myself. Who pays the shipping?

Ebay,eBay account suspended indefinitely - need help!,"Hi everyone,

Need some help/advice.  My account (member since 2008) was indefinitely suspended due to association with my sister's new account.  Her account was indefinitely suspended too.  When I called eBay, they said they did this because we shared the same IP address and home address.  When I explain to them that we do not use the same account and not associated with each other, they did not care and stated that they made their final decision.  I have been reading a lot about this on reddit and other sites, but not sure if the answers are up to date.

Few questions:

- What are our options?  Does indefinitely, per ebay, mean that I am banned from selling for life or is it for a period of time?

- is there any way around this?  Can I delete my account and make a new one using a different mailing address? 

- My sister had a few sold items the same day her account got suspended that were not shipped out yet.  The transactions are not in her ebay account history anymore but the transactions and money are still in her paypal.  Should she still ship them out?  When I spoke to the ebay rep, they said that I can still ship the items through Paypal but if the buyer opens up a case, she will most likely lose.

- if all goes bad.....what other sites are good to sell on?  I know about amazon, facebook, and craigslist.

Ebay,Oddball Ebay Buyers &amp; Seller Types Thread...Post your Weirdo,"Ok, I'll start off with a few recent weirdos.

**Tea Cup Guy**  My wife found this Royal Albert Tea Cup &amp; Saucer at an Estate Sale she liked so we research it and list it on Ebay for $149.99. Tea Cup Guy starts messaging us telling us we can't sell that tea cup for that much money and we don't know what we are doing but he can get $149.99 or more so we should sell it to him cheap.  We look at his items for sale and sure enough he sells tea cups.  He continues to berate us for a few hours until the Tea Cup &amp; Saucer sold...for $149.99. Then we blocked him.

**Art Deco Guy**  We bought a silver plated cocktail shaker at an estate sale for $5.00 and it looked to be Art Deco to us so we list it as an art deco cocktail shaker.  Art Deco Guy begins to berate us saying that the shaker is not art deco and he is going to report us to Ebay and get us suspended for lying if we don't change the description so we block him.  Never heard anything from Ebay about it.  We sold that sucker for $79.99.

**Coach Purse Lady** Kind of like Tea Cup Guy but with Coach Purses. We don't usually deal with Coach Purses but when we find one cheap at a garage or estate sale and confirm it is authentic we list it for sale.  She begins to berate us over the 3 or 4 Coach Purses we have for sale telling us they are fake.  We take a look and sure enough she sells Coach Purses among other things but mostly purses.  Sure enough the next morning we find all our Coach Purses have been pulled by Ebay for being ""fake"".  We have to get on the phone to Ebay (TRS+ Silver Power Sellers) and clear it up. Then we block her and relist the purses and have no further problems out of her. Later we see that she was NARU'ed.

**Stereo Vacuum Tube Guy**  I bought a big box full of old vacuum tubes about the size of a standard ice chest.  I start researching them and find 2 boxes of 5 matching tubes where the over sleeve matches the tubes. It turns out they were rare stereo tubes matched at the factory and very valuable so we list them at about the going price.  Along comes Vacuum Tube Guy who starts asking us needy questions so we look at his Feedback Left For Others and see he leaves about 10% Negative and Neutral Feedback for apparently trivial reasons so we block him.  Yes, he tries to buy the tubes and since he asked a question about them his messages are not blocked until the listing ends. He goes bananas and rips us a new one but we ignore him. The tubes sell about an hour later. If he had just kept his mouth shut and bought them to begin with he would have had them. 

**Alarm Panel Guy**  So A friend of mine has a couple of vintage working alarm panels and gave them to me to get them out of his server racks. You know, the kind of panels alarm companies use. Well these were from a well know and respected manufacturer but were long out of production. If you have one of these and it fails you are up do-do creek so they are sought after by alarm companies that still use them for replacement parts. Alarm Panel Guy sends us a low ball offer so we block him. I guess you can see where this is going. He tries to buy it now and finds himself blocked. Yup, the messaging block will not take effect until this item is sold so after a few days of harassment he finally breaks down and messages us that his alarm panel had failed and he is desperate to buy this one as a replacement.  We double the price and unblock him. He buys it and we never hear from him again. Why do people have to low ball on something they desperately need, go apesh!t about it when they get blocked, and then be willing to pay double for it a week later?

**Geiger Counter Dude** Not a weirdo at all. I picked up an old Ludlum Geiger Counter for $3.00 at a garage sale and list if for $600 on Ebay. Geiger Counter Dude sends a message and tells me he used to use this exact Geiger Counter at K-25 in Oak Ridge Tennessee back in the day and it was calibrated to be a whatchamadigit.  I say whatchamadigit since what he said was totally over my head and I forget the exact term he used. So I update the listing and the thing sells 10 minutes later.

Messaging some sellers usually gets a response around ebay being broken. Would my only option here be to pay the full amount and hope for some degree of postage refund?

Ebay,Question about potential fraud,"TLDR- won auction for $60, item was purchased from manufacturer and drop shipped for $160. Could this come back to bite me if it was purchased using a stolen credit card?

My daughter wanted a pair of Uggs, being 12 I wasn't going to pay full price for a pair and she didn't care if they were used so off to ebay I go! 

After searching and bidding on a few pairs with always being out bidded I found a pair brand new with the auction ending soon. This person had a couple negs for not following through with the sale, but I figured 'what the hell' and bid $60. I figured if they didn't send the boots ebay would refund me and I could at least say I tried.

Happily the boots arrived and I verified they were authentic.  They were sent directly from Ugg and the invoice inside stated that they were purchased by (I'm assuming) the seller and ship to me.

But the more I thought about it and how odd that was- I started to wonder if they werent purchased with a stolen credit card. 

The account is still active, though there are no more items for sale. (They only had a few to begin with)

If it was a stolen credit card will that affect me in any way?? Should I be prepared to send the boots back?

Ebay,RE: Returns accepted - which is better - Merchandise Credit or Money Back,"I'm in Australia so the system may vary from the US slightly. 

My preference (as a used item seller) is not to accept refunds, but I believe / understand that choosing the Does Not Accept Refunds option is essentially pointless and harmful because buyers can insist on getting a refund and are likely to be granted a 100% refund, whereas with the Refund as an option the seller gets to set some limitations (20% restocking fee) which should compensate for genuine losses incurred by the seller, as well as discouraging frivolous or fraudulent returns. 

I was wondering if selecting Merchandise Credit is better for the seller too? 

For my store it's unlikely that someone would want to receive Merchandise Credit as they're unlikely to want to purchase a replacement item - I normally only have quantity of one for a certain item. 

So I was thinking maybe this is an effective way to further discourage frivolous returns, or if ebay would force a full refund in the event of the buyer stating that they do not want credit but want a full refund.",10,4,2016-11-23,EBAY,0.07193712145090103,0.8851487636566162,0.04291412979364395

Ebay,I purchased a 12-year old laptop from Ebay with too much user data on it,"Hey everyone. Newbie. 

I recently purchased a 12-year old laptop on Ebay for about $40, mainly as a toy for a tech-illiterate family member. However, the laptop came loaded with user data including resumes, old university coursework, PowerPoint presentations, and even porn.

Nothing suspicious about the auction initially--the pictures showed the desktop, so it seemed pretty reasonable that the seller would've known the password.

However, the laptop is set to auto-login. Also, the name on the return address is very white-sounding while the name on the laptop is very Hispanic. As well, using the old resumes on the laptop I managed to find who used to own the laptop on Facebook using the phone number provided. His location and the return address for the laptop basically don't match up.

My original plan was to just wipe the drive immediately and not go poking through what the old user left. However, ethically I feel like if this laptop were stolen, the old user might at least want their family photos and such back.

As a buyer, should I contact the number on the resume and ask about the history of the laptop? Would I be opening myself up to legal trouble by doing so?",11,6,2016-11-24,EBAY,0.06630990654230118,0.904657244682312,0.029032884165644646

Ebay,Someone defrauding Paypal through eBay?,"Hi there,

2nd time this has happened on eBay for me, but here we go.

I see an item i want at the right price (£500~), so i buy it now, and pay, everything is fine so far. A day or 2 later, it gets marked as posted. A couple more days later, i get an email from eBay telling me that the seller has cancelled the order, and asks me to go to their site where it asks me when i received the refund.

As i haven't received a refund, i'm leaving that alone, but i contact the seller asking when i'm likely to receive the refund.

The reply? 

&gt;talk to Paypal about refund

So at this point, i should be covered under the money back protection stuff, but it looks to me like this person sold a bunch of stuff, took the money out of Paypal, then cancelled all the orders, leaving the Paypal account in the red.

Has anyone see this before, and if so, any tips on dealing with it? I assume it's just a case of waiting for eBay and Paypal's time limits to hit so it's refunded back, as the only thing i can do at the moment is start a Paypal case, as eBay already has a case open and it's waiting for me to ""take action"".

Maybe that's the scam, the seller hopes that i'll just blindly click through it saying that i've received the refund, when i haven't.

Anyways, thanks for any help you can throw my way.

He said it's for a Christmas gift and needs the original box. I offered to refund $25 for his trouble, but he counter offered $100. 

I told him that I would be glad to refund his money, but he will be responsible for shipping the phone back to me on his dime. Of course, I get an email that a INAD dispute has been opened with PayPal. I already agreed to a refund, but I need to receive the phone first.

Hopefully I receive the phone in the same condition it was shipped in. But part of me is wondering if this is a scam. Why would the IMEI being different on a box even matter for a gift of a phone that's two years old? Don't most people just chuck the box or store it in a cabinet?

Ebay,"I'm new to eBay and need tips on selling a bulky, expensive computer.","Hi folks. 

My dad passed away recently and left me, among other things, an assortment of computers. One of them is a 27inch late 2014 iMac. I already own a 27 inch iMac, and so a second one is kind of pointless.

I was hoping to sell on eBay, but my friend who sells on eBay a lot (and frequents this subreddit, hi Burt) warned that scammers often target bigger ticket items. They suggested Craigslist, but I'm less comfortable hauling a ~$2,000 dollar computer around and exchanging it with no middle man or real paper trail. Glancing at prices eBay seems to average a few hundred dollars more than Craigslist which would seem offset shipping and fees. The highest price for a similar model on Craigslist is ~$1500, whereas eBay seems to have the same computer in the ~$2200 to $2600 range (although that latter price seems pretty optimistic).

I feel like I need advice and basic tips. Is there anything I need to watch out for? I have the original box the computer came in. It's in perfect condition and I could make it basically factory new in 30 minutes. I figured as long as I get insurance up to it's actual sale price and recorded solid evidence of its quality and functionality to use in the case of any fraudulent disputes, I should be basically fine. Is there anything specific other than that I need to do to protect myself from scammers / disasters? I never use eBay and my friend has no experience selling expensive stuff.

Ebay,I was scammed out of my money on eBay.. anybody have ideas for recourse?,"So here's what happened... I sold my camera on eBay for $800. The buyer offered to pay for overnight shipping for $100. I received an email from PayPal saying he made the payment for camera and shipping, and it will be deposited in 24 hours. I shipped off the camera.. only to realize that the email was a phony and he phished me. He never sent the money and is now gone with my camera already have been delivered. 

Is there anyway to recoup my loss? Does eBay offer any seller protection in cases like this? I called customer service but lady on the phone just told me to contact my local police. Not very helpful.",21,2,2016-11-30,EBAY,0.04727478325366974,0.9170069098472595,0.03571823984384537
