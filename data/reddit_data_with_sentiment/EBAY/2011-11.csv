Ebay,New to selling. Questionable emails,"So I'm trying to sell some stuff to bring in extra $$ for the holidays. I have 2 items listed. One has a reserve price $50 the other I started bids at $9(least I would take)  and got 2 emails regarding them.

Email #1 wants to know if I would take $45 for both and change the auction to a buy it now.  

I replied I would not take such a cut and they were welcome to participate in the auction as it is.

Email#2 is interested in the higher priced item and wants to know if I'll ship to the UK (I'm in the US)
They also want to know if I would change the auction to BIN.

I told them I would be willing to ship to a verified address, but they too would have to bid like everyone else.

It's been a while since I've sold on eBay so I'm not aware of all the latest scams.
I'm a little leery of both of these potential buyers.

Ebay,Is a seller responsible for shipping during selling or not?,"I made a post before about how I received a Macbook Pro off of eBay. The laptop was damaged when I received it. The sellers argument is that it must have been damaged during shipping. They are telling me that they are not responsible for damage during shipping. I have opened a case and this was his response.

""Mr ********, I can assure you that the laptop I sent you was in the condition described. In no way was the screen cracked. Additionally the battery was tested prior to shipping and it was confirmed to hold a charge and last about 30-45 minutes as described in the listing. You stated in prior correspondence that the box the laptop was shipped in appeared to be damaged. I suspect that the issues you are experiencing are related to possible damage done during shipping. I will do everything in my power to aid you in resolving this issue, however I packaged the laptop very well and I cannot be held liable for goods that were damaged in shipping. Thank you. **** ******""

Ebay,"Bought an iPhone, think I may have gotten scammed","So last weekend I was scouting eBay for a nice iphone 3GS to use personally. I waited for a good deal, and found an auction pop up with a close to mint iPhone for $150 from a non power seller with 200+ 100% feedback. Everything looked in order, so I bought the phone and sent the payment Sunday night. I immediately emailed and asked about shipping details. Next morning, no response. Waited until Tuesday, still no response, so another email to the paypal listed personal email, and an eBay message, was sent. Waited for the night,No response. Next day? No response. I know it's kind of early, but this person has my money, and I have no way of knowing that the phone will get to me at all.

Now, I'm thinking of filing a charge back with my CC company by the end of the week. eBay wants me to wait until Dec. 2 to even start a claim, I think that's ridiculous.

Fast forward a month later and look what turned up in the mail! (http://i.imgur.com/AFDEx.jpg) - he's really soft, and very well made, not falling apart like I expected. In fact the stitches are stronger than most toys I've seen around. One very happy eBay buyer!

Ebay,Who pays return shipping on damaged items due to poor packing?,"I bought a ~$100 item (used auto component) and it arrived with two large cracks in the plastic housing. From my judgement, this was clearly a result of the fact that the item was packaged in nothing but a padded envelope. The item is 15 years old, hollow and made of plastic, so I would think it would have been more appropriate to ship it in a box. To stick a bulky, hollow, plastic item in a padded envelope for a cross country voyage seems negligent to me. The cracks don't necessarily effect functionality, but I don't want to accept damaged goods, especially since it was so expensive. The seller has a 7 day money back return policy so I intend to return the item. But the policy also says ""buyer pays return shipping"".

Ebay,If you change your account to business do eBay go informing the government or what?,"I basically use my eBay account for some extra income selling small things at small margins but I make a few hundred pounds (I'm in the UK) a month out of my little business on the side. Because I don't make much I've always kept my account as a personal account.

Now though eBay have account limits up to 100 items a month or £3500 in sales. I make nowhere near that amount of money but I easily sell 100 items... to increase limits they want me to change to business account but I'm worried that if I do that they'll start asking for VAT numbers or informing the government about my little operation.

Personally if I have to worry about filing tax and concerning myself about audits and the like I just won't bother doing it anymore. There's no way it's worth the hassle. However I'm interested in hearing if anybody else has a business account but doesn't declare their earnings and how much money they make? What's eBay's policy about passing on your info to the man?

I know you're never 100% safe but curious to know what other people do. I'm in a position where I'm trying to gradually build a small business but if I have to start worrying about tax and declarations and all that then I'm going to quit before I've begun. Obviously if I ever got to a point that I was making the kind of money that would allow me to quit my job (minimum wage basically) then I'd start thinking about declaring but at the moment we're only talking about £50 a week that I'm making ($85)

Ebay,MC015 Security notice: eBay listing removed,"I am posting this information for future reference to those who are interested, since I could not find any prior post here on /r/ebay about MC015 security notices.  This is all new to me, and I've been on eBay for over a decade.

---

About a month ago I found a long list of no reserve/free shipping auctions from a seller in China.  I've purchased quite a few items from China in the past without any problems, and this particular seller had a decent history on eBay since June of last year with well over a thousand transactions and 99.6% positive feedback.  The items were quite nice looking and I thought it would be worth trying to win as many as I could for the best price possible.  I placed bids for a total of 63 items and ended up winning a dozen of them at a total of ~$150, which I paid for immediately via Paypal.  I did not really need these things, but the deal was too good to pass up.  I figured I'd keep one or two items and take the rest to a pawn shop to easily double my money, or maybe hold on to a few of them for Christmas presents.  I've been patiently waiting for the items to arrive, knowing that it could take up to six weeks (from my experience).  But then I received 63 emails all at once from eBay very early this morning with the subject line: ""MC015 Security notice: eBay listing removed - [username]""

The text of every email is as follows:

---

&gt; Hello [username] (name@email.com),

&gt; We're writing to let you know that this listing for an item you won or bid on is no longer available:

&gt; [Item number] - [Item description]

&gt; We understand this may be disappointing, but occasionally we need to remove listings. In some cases, the item itself is fine, but was listed in a way that didn't follow eBay's guidelines.

&gt; Here's what you can do next:

&gt; -- If you already paid, received your item, and you're satisfied, please disregard this notice. 

&gt; -- If you won the item but haven't paid, don't pay. Since eBay removed the listing, you're no longer obligated to go through with the transaction.

&gt; -- If you already paid for this item through eBay, and it's past the estimated delivery time, you can open a case in our Resolution Center. Click the link below, and select the ""I haven't received it yet"" option. This will guide you through the process of opening a case.

&gt; http://resolutioncenter.ebay.com

&gt; If the seller offers you the item outside of eBay, we strongly discourage you from accepting the offer. These types of transactions are extremely risky and aren't covered by eBay buyer protection programs.

&gt; If you didn't pay through eBay or PayPal, and:

&gt; -- You paid by Western Union or MoneyGram, contact the company directly (Western Union 800-325-6000 or MoneyGram 800-926-9400).

&gt; -- You paid by check, contact your bank to stop payment.

&gt; Thanks,

&gt; eBay

I hadn't ever seen this before, so I went to eBay's [Customer Support page](http://ocs.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?CustomerSupport) and searched for ""MC015"".  I got no result, except ""We didn't find a good match for your search. Please try again.""  Now I am quite confused and I try going to one of the auction pages, and it shows: ""This listing [item number] has been removed, or this item is not available.""  

I thought this was very unusual, but it gets even stranger.  I go to view my purchase history and not a single auction from this seller is shown.  They did not appear on my ""Leave feeback"" and ""Didn't win"" pages either.  However, when I go to their profile page, it is still up and they are currently a registered user (although there are no items for sale).  I then check out their feedback page and all of their most recent feedback is negative, with comments stating the item was not received and the seller is not responding to messages.

I immediately went to Paypal's website to their Resolution Center to file a dispute.  Luckily for me, with over 800 transactions over the last 10+ years, this is somehow only the second time I've had to do this.  The first step in filing a dispute/claim is sending a message to the seller.  I do so, but when I clicked ""next"" Paypal says this seller is not availabe at this time and the dispute immediately escalates to a claim.  

It can take up to thirty days (or more, actually) to hear back from Paypal, but I'm hoping this will not take long at all since it appears clear at this point there is some sort of scam going on here.  

I hope this information will be useful to somebody, somehow, since I could not find an official eBay explaination for what a ""MC015 Security notice"" is.  From what I can tell, it appears the listings were fraudulent.  Why eBay completely removed every one of those from my account without a clear explaination is still a mystery to me though.  Why simply remove a listing a month after it ended?  There must be a specific reason and I feel I should be made aware of that exact reason.  I tried looking through their forums, but the information was very limited (even though I found users who have received MC015 notices).  I also tried Google, but so far I have not found anything valuable.

If anybody has had a similar experince, or knows what happened here, I am very interested to hear it.  Additionally, I will update this post with any new information I receive, including when (and if?) I get my money back.",7,2,2011-11-28,EBAY,0.051392488181591034,0.8978306651115417,0.05077685695141554
Ebay,Seller wants to cancel transaction - after I paid.,"Last evening I won an auction for an item of clothing. This morning there was already a message from the seller telling me that she hadn't received my payment and would re-list the item later today if I didn't pay, which I immediately did after getting the message.

Now the seller sent me another message, telling me that, because of a technical error she made, she wants to cancel the transaction and needs my understanding about this and will immediately return my money.

Now, I really want this clothing, it's an designer item that I really like and I understand if she could have wanted more money for it (I was the only bidder). But can I force her to send me the item? 
Has anyone here been in this kind of situation before?",8,6,2011-11-29,EBAY,0.11277972906827927,0.852465808391571,0.03475446254014969
Ebay,"It is unethical that Ebay and Paypal both take commissions off seller totals. Ebay owns Paypal, they need to unify the charge when selling on Ebay and not punish their sellers who are required to use Paypal.","Ebay, because it now own Paypal, should be more ethical and honest with their seller base.  Ebay seller fees and Paypal money handling fees should not be able to take percentages off the ""gross"" sale of your merchandise.  They need to address how they've created this system, especially when you are required to offer Paypal as a payment option.
Anyone else agree?",16,10,2011-11-30,EBAY,0.023632271215319633,0.9429864883422852,0.03338126838207245
Ebay,"Sellers of eBay, do any of you have experience with Atandra? Or any other software integration for accounting and shipping?","Our Store has gotten to the point where manually invoicing and creating shipping labels for each order is taking too much time out of the day.

I've come across a company called Atandra that makes software that is supposed to integrate both shipping and accounting with eBay. The problem is I can't seem to find out much about them. They have both good and bad reviews. It seems like the product is great for some people, but when it has issues their customer support is terrible.

Anyone have experience with them? Or do you guys use some other software for this purpose?",7,5,2011-11-30,EBAY,0.06229812651872635,0.9061262607574463,0.03157556429505348
