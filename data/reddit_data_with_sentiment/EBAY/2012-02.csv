Ebay,Just One of My Horrendous Experiences with Ebay,"To anybody who had trouble buying and HP touchpad on eBay in December. I have experienced the absolute worst customer service experience. I have called tech support 13 times and spent nearly 20 hours with them. I've been called a liar, I've been told I don't know what I'm talking about, and above all I've been given 20 different excuses just to get me to call back later or drop the matter entirely. All I've been trying to do is to get the $100 gift certificate that they sent to everybody who experienced glitches while trying to buy the HP Touchpad. http://blog.auctionbytes.com/cgi-bin/blog/blog.pl?/pl/2011/12/1325104554.html &lt;--- this to be precise and I have a legitimate email from the same eBay address I have received correspondence from over 50 times in the past. Ebay has been absolutely terrible with handling my case (they have deleted my job notes 3 times now so I've had to start from scratch twice). I know they are a large company and will most likely delete this as soon as they read it, but I want everybody to know how absolutely horrendous this whole ordeal has become. When did the individual customer stop mattering?

Update: I called one more time over a week ago and was escalated to a supervisor. I was supposed to be contacted in 24 hours and I haven't been called now in nearly 2 weeks",13,6,2012-02-01,EBAY,0.1343626230955124,0.8431674242019653,0.02246994525194168

Ebay,Classfy. A marketplace that doesn't suck,"Hello. We are looking for people to signup for our new marketplace startup that attempts to solve the problems that plague eBay and Craigslist. Some features that we think redditors would appreciate: 

* Add your reddit, forum, skype,...ect username to your profile. We think that communication is key to building trust online. (Buying something expensive online? Skype the seller to see it upclose!) You can also add your ebay profile (We don't want you to build your reputation from scratch)
* No fees. We really mean it. No listing fees or commissions..ect. We also allow you to use any payment method. For example, a payment processor called dWolla, doesn't charge any fees for transactions under $10. If you use Classfy+dWolla, it means that your transaction will be %100 free. Of course this opens the door to swapping, using alternative currencies like bitcoins. Of course it's optional you can stick to PayPal. :)

Ebay,Question for my fellow sellers: how do you choose between USPS or UPS?,"I'm selling a xbox 360 game bundle that's bigger/heavier than anything I've sold in the past, and I would like to know what my fellow redditors reccommend I do.

The bundle's dimensions (according to amazon) are:
18.3 x 11 x 3.9 inches ; 4.2 pounds (let's add another pound for shipping)

I'm used to choosing flat-rate and charging $4.00 (because that's the max I'm allowed). My item's are usually smaller than this but I still end up losing money on shipping costs (sometimes will come out to $7-$9 and I just eat the cost of the rest). I'm kind of sick of this method, and would like to use the built-in calculator instead, so the buyer pays exactly what it costs, nothing more, nothing less.

My question is, how do I gauge which service will cost less since I don't know where the prospective buyer lives? Also, since I don't know what the price of the shipping will be, I won't be able to adjust my auction price accordingly. Is there a general rule of thumb with respect to the shipping service when the item is within a certain weight?

How do sellers usually approach this? Thanks in advance",7,2,2012-02-04,EBAY,0.028731998056173325,0.9287331700325012,0.04253476858139038

Ebay,Advice on complicated issue.,"Hey everybody,
 
Not sure if this is the appropriate place for this post, but I just made my first sell about a week ago, and wouldn't you know it, there's a complication. I sold a Motorola Droid Razr for $450. The seller received the item today then personally e-mailed me saying that he had taken it to the Verizon store (it is a verizon phone) and they had deemed it defective.
I need to know what to do, and what the normal process is here. Is this something he needs to take care of. I don't want to screw the guy over, but I don't want to be screwed over either.
The user has 18 positive feedbacks from past transactions so it seems like this definitely isn't a normal thing for him, however, I had tested the phone before shipping it off and I don't feel I should be responsible for something that may have happened to the phone after it left my hands. The phone worked fine the day I shipped it off.

I contacted eBay customer service just now and they said that I needed to ask the buyer to return the item, at his cost, and until then I would not be obligated to refund the money, which is logical.
I replied with the e-mail we had been talking on with a message to this effect. The big question is, is there anything else I need to do right 
now? Is there anyone who's gone through a similar situation that would be able to offer any advice on this issue to cover my assets a little better.",13,3,2012-02-11,EBAY,0.07271850109100342,0.8982395529747009,0.029041921719908714
Ebay,What is my recourse? Experienced Sellers: What would you do?,"* I sold a used laptop ""not working -- for parts"" on eBay with a ""no return"" policy for $76 + shipping. 
* The buyer said that it had a DVD-ROM instead of the advertised (via eBay template) DVD-RW and wanted $20 reduction in price. 
* I asked for proof that the wrong drive was in there -- post a picture of the drive. 
* No response.
* I offered to take the item back, minus shipping (~$5).
* No response.
* Buyer opened a case against me.
* During the resolution period I called the Buyer twice. Buyer never picked up and their voicemail had no message. I left my name and number each time.
* No response.
* I emailed the Buyer (via eBay) said that they hadn't tried to work it out with me so I offered a $10 reduction in price, just to make the problem go away.
* Buyer moved the case to arbitration.
* eBay sided with the Buyer, &lt;sarcasm&gt;big surprise&lt;/sarcasm&gt; -- Buyer returns the laptop and I refund the money.
* I received the laptop. The battery was missing, a few screws were missing from the case, and it smelled like it had been kept in a smokey house.
*  I wrote the Buyer and told them that what he did was wrong and that he can take the laptop back or I'll report him.
*  Buyer told me to pound sand.

This seems like too much drama for the money.

&gt;**Payment methods not allowed on eBay**:

&gt;For most categories, sellers can't ask buyers to:

&gt;    *Send cash through the mail*

&gt;    Send cash or money orders through instant, point-to-point cash transfer services (that are not banks) such as Western Union or MoneyGram

&gt;    *Mail checks or money orders* (except for items in categories specifically permitted below)

&gt;    Pay through bank-to-bank transfers (except for items in categories specifically permitted below)

&gt;    *Pay using online or other payment methods not specifically permitted in this policy*


The listing categories that are allowed as exceptions, and can be payed with these ""not allowed payment methods"", is a long list, but actually quite limiting, as it's mostly vehicles and industrial equipment and parts therefore.

The thing that I don't get is, it says ""Payment methods not allowed"", but then the very first line item says ""sellers can't ask"", which is it? What does this policy really mean, what is it trying to say, what can a buyer do and not do from reading this policy?",21,2,2012-02-15,EBAY,0.03271223604679108,0.9366614818572998,0.030626270920038223

Ebay,Stupid eBay situation. What do you think could be a consequence of this? A tad long...,"So I sold a Mesa Boogie F-50 Guitar amplifier to a guy in NJ about a month ago. He purchased the amp, paid for it, and sent me a message as soon as he paid for it. It said this (these are direct copied and pasted messages btw): 

""I purchased F50 and just have completed the payment.  I'd like to have it by next Monday (1/30).  Will it be possible and would you mind rush shipping today?
Thank you.""

Now, on my eBay listing, I said that I needed 1-3 days of handling time, then was going to ship USPS priority mail to NJ. I charged $50 shipping and handling because I needed to find a box, get the packaging, and find a way to secure an amp that weighed 57 lbs (tube circuitry) for the long, perilous journey to NJ from NC. Since I had already posted all of this information before he even bid on it, I sent this back:

""I could send rush shipping, but that requires more shipping money. The shipping cost right now is the cheapest price out there, since the amp is rather heavy.""

I mean, he was asking me to do something that I didn't have to do, and since I alotted up to 3 days of handling due to my class schedule, I only asked him to compensate me for doing him this favor. He sent me this message in response:

""I understand what you told me.  But I wonder if you can ship today.  We are in NJ and it wouldn't take long from NC if you ship today.
Thank you.""

Well, it was apparent that he didn't give a flying fuck about what I requested (which I think is fair...shipping on a 57 lb amp thats almost 2'x3' is hella expensive), so I wasn't going to rush that shit. I responded with:

""If you'll be willing to reimburse me for shipping in excess of $50, I will send it out tomorrow. I stated that I require up to 3 days of handling, but will try my best to get it done ASAP. Are you asking for next day shipping? Or what other shipping method were you considering? Also, I have access to both USPS and UPS, whichever you prefer. Awaiting your response about the shipping questions.""

Being more specific and adamant that we pursue that course of action, I tried to get an answer out of him. To no avail, my NJ friend replied:

""Dear duhjeffmeister,
$50.00 shipping and handling is already high enough. I was asking you because you mentioned to have it delivered 1/30 ~ 1/31.  Taking 3 days in handling sounds too long. It will be desirable to have it by Monday(1/30), but Tuesday wouldn't make trouble to me.  Please try your best to make your buyer happy and to keep your estimated delivery date that was posted as below:
Thanks. 

Mesa Boogie F50 F-50 1x12 50 Watt Electric Guitar Amplifier w/ Footswitch (250976585978)
Paid on Jan-24-12
Price: $550.00, Qty: 1	$550.00
Estimated delivery: January 30 - January 31, 2012	USPS Priority Mail	$50.00""

Now, this receipt that he had copied and pasted was from Paypal's website. As everyone knows, based on the date of payment, Paypal generates an estimated delivery. I hadn't sent the amp out yet, nor had I even gotten the box yet. I'm a double major in Applied Math and Jazz Guitar/Recording that's about to graduate in May. Needless to say, I'm fairly busy, either doing homework for my math classes or practicing my ass off for my jazz guitar lessons. That's the reason why I allowed myself 1-3 days for handling. I was getting pretty agitated and responded this:

""I'm giving you the lowest rate possible already, and i'm taking 3 days to handle it. Paypal gave a shipping estimate, not me. In fact, there is no shipping estimate that I myself have given, since I gave myself three days to handle it. I have my reasons for doing so and listed an accurate amount of time in my listing. It was in the item description, and you continued to bid on it. If you actually researched the product, you would find that the amp weighs 50 lbs, increasing shipping cost drastically. $50 is the lowest rate that UPS offers for standard ground shipping. Sorry you don't approve, but I listed all details in my listing. I'll follow what I published online. Thanks for your input.""

(^I found that UPS would be more convenient for his house so I went with them)

No response to that. I figured that my trouble with this guy was over and I could get back to my studies. It also didn't help that I've been dealing with anxiety/depression and taking medication for it since I hadn't taken less than 22 credit hours in 7 semesters of being in school (all so I can graduate on time, which is still happening!).

Two days later I sent my amp, giving all of my packing supplies to the UPS guy so he could pack it. I was running late for a night class and had to leave the packing to him. Probably not a smart idea, but I don't like the idea of wasting thousands of dollars for college and not getting the most out of my classes.

I marked the item as shipped, gave him a tracking number, then waited to make sure I was completely done. (I also found out he has an asian last name, and as the messages kept being sent, the accuracy of his grammar was declining.) When the package arrived, he sent this message:

""I received the package yesterday evening, but found that the amp was not working because of broken tube.  I need to resolve this problem with you ASAP&gt;""     &lt;== Typo on his part

The dialogue follows:

Me: ""Also I apologize for the broken tube. I brought in a box that the UPS employee said would work, then paid to have it both packed and shipped, so I didn't personally pack it.""

*No response from him*

Me: ""Would you like me to buy you a new tube?""

Him: ""Please send me a new tube that works ASAP.""

Me: ""Please tell me which tube is broken and what model it is.""

Him: ""The broken tube is the left one when you see from back and the model# is 5881/6L6 WGC, SOVTEK 1001""

Me: ""Tracking number for the tube is: 9101969005339501501317""

Him: ""Thank you for following up, but I couldn't locate the tracking in USPS.com.  I also found that both tubes were broken.  The left one was totally broken with sign of burning and the right one's knob with legs was also broken.  I found the broken plastic piece of the knob in the amp.""    &lt;== Grammar? Also, what in the world is he talking about ""sign of burning"" (Where? Details please?) and ""the right one's knob with legs was also broken""? Why didn't he check the whole amp before I ordered him a tube and had to spend $8 on shipping, only to find that I had to order him ANOTHER tube and pay even MORE shipping.

Me: ""So two of the same tubes were broken?""

Him: ""Yes, I found both tubes were broken in different ways as I described before.""

Me: ""I will order and send it your way asap""

Him: ""The first tube was received yesterday and I wonder if the second tube in on the way.""

Me: ""Yes sir it is on its way. Sorry, I didn't know that both tubes were broken, or else I would have sent both at once.""

Him: ""I have received the second tube and mounted both tubes, but the amp still doesn't work.  This is very disappointing and I don't know if I can repair the amp locally or send you back to make it work.  Please let me know what you would do.""

Right there, as soon as I realized he was going to put the tubes in himself, I started to kind of worry, since it seems to me that he doesn't know what he's doing or talking about. I kept thinking ""Oh God...please don't damage the amp further..."" Continuing...

Me: ""Fix it locally. Much easier.""

Him: ""I agree, however, I need your commitment of reimbursement for the reparing cost. Otherwise, I have no choice but sending you back for fixing there.  The amp sounds weird with lots of static.  Channel switching also doesn't seem to be fine. As I saw the first tube was burn and broken, the circuit must has been screwed when the tube was burn.""

My worst nightmare. He installed the tube incorrectly, which is denoted by the symptom of the lots of static and noise. Hopefully he didn't damage it too much. The footswitch (What he called the channel switcher) was completely fine save for the jack being a snug fit with the cable. You have to basically push with a decent amount of force to get the cable end in there.

Immediately I was thinking ""Dude...you installed the vacuum tube wrong and probably messed the amp up more. Why would I have to pay for it? I didn't even pack it. The UPS guy packed it (which isn't uncommon, as I found out from local guitar businesses) and didn't do as good of a job as he should have.""",11,3,2012-02-16,EBAY,0.10425904206931591,0.860710471868515,0.035030486062169075

Ebay,Have I screwed myself over here? (UK),"I recently sold an expensive item on eBay, and the buyer messaged me through eBay and asked if I could post it to his parents address as it's a present for his wife. I, being somewhat foolish, obliged, and I bought the postage through Paypal (I got Recorded Signed For delivery), and sent the item off.

Over a week later, and the item hasn't arrived. I check the tracking and it says when and where it was posted from, and that the item is ""being progressed through our network"". Now, I told the buyer all of this, gave him the tracking number, and have told him that I can't do anything until 15 working days after the due date, because that's when the Royal Mail site says I can claim compensation.

Now, the problem I have here is that because I sent it to an alternate address than the one on his eBay account, I don't have seller protection on Paypal. I -do- have the message in ""My Messages"" on eBay from him which asks me to send the item to an alternate address. And I have the proof of postage firstly from Paypal where I bought it and secondly the paper receipt from the post office when I sent it, so that's something... but is it enough?

I'm worried that the item has either reached there and not been signed for (in which case he is scamming me), or that Royal Mail have lost the item.

They're probably 2.5 ounces total and less than .25"" thick. Can I mail these in a letter with a stamp, or do I need to mail it as a parcel? This through USPS, obviously.",8,3,2012-02-29,EBAY,0.01667211949825287,0.8795818090438843,0.10374604165554047
Ebay,"Buyer refused item, hasn't contacted me, now what?","So I sold an item back in December, before Christmas.  About a week passed without payment, so I opened up a claim for an unpaid item.  I receive payment through paypal shortly thereafter, close the claim and send out the item.  (I added insurance signature requested to the item as it sold for $200+ and it was going to a PO Box).

Few days ago i got an postcard in the mail informing me i had a parcel at the post office.  Confused as to what it is I go and pick it up, it's the item i sold back in December.

Buyer hasn't contacted me, or responded to email.  Now What?

What I am *really*tempted to do:  Keep the $ and relist the item
What I am going to probably going to do: refund and relist.

Anyone have any input?

TL;DR: see title.+ no contact from buyer+want to keep the $",12,3,2012-02-29,EBAY,0.06187976524233818,0.9108894467353821,0.02723073773086071
Ebay,Item Arrived Damaged. Do I Have A Case?,"I purchased a turntable that arrived broken, and I would like to resolve it as fairly as possible.  The main points are these:

* The item was described as being in perfect working order in the auction, and the one external, visible piece that would later break is seen intact in the pictures.

* The seller had never shipped a turntable before, and was not aware (nor was I) that every removable piece needed to be removed and packaged separately.  The strain placed on the cueing mechanism by the heavy tonearm and counterweight was enough to damage it during shipping.  The damage was external and internal.

* Earlier, I sent the seller [this message](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/q9tu5/how_is_this_for_a_request_for_resolution_on_an/), letting him know the situation and getting a feel for his willingness to work with me.  He responded graciously and told me that he was willing to pony up some repair money.  

* The repair tech, whom I trust, told me that the kind of repair needed would be tenuous and, from his experience, he would expect a domino effect of repairs over time.  My best bet, he said, is to try to return it or sell it for parts, and never buy a turntable online again.

* I explained this to the seller and asked him to accept the return.  He told me that his auction stated no refunds, and the item was in working order when he shipped it, and that he has been selling on ebay for 8 years without an issue, and so on.  He refused a return, but he said he would ask his Post Office if anything can be done since the item seems to have been damaged during shipping.  There was no insurance taken out on this delivery, so I can't imagine what the USPS can do.

Bottom line is that I don't want to get into a feud, but I don't want to lose all the money I paid for this.  I feel that, from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/k5pf0/buyer_wants_to_return_help_me_on_my_first_time/), I might have a case with Buyer Protection.  I ask you sellers, is this a case of ""item not as described,"" or would I be abusing the system?


**UPDATE:** The seller says he has filed a claim with USPS, and that it will take up to 15 days to file. I would like nothing more than to resolve this to our mutual satisfaction.",0,2,2012-02-29,EBAY,0.06332633644342422,0.9030009508132935,0.0336727611720562
