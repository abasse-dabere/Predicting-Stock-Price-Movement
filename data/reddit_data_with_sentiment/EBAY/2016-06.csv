Ebay,Is it time to file an Item not received claim against this seller?,"First time I have ever had this happen to me as a buyer so I'm not sure if I'm just being too hasty or if I should be past the point of patience.  Really just looking for some feedback on the situation:

I purchased a high dollar collectible from a seller on May 20th (&gt;$100) with an estimated 3 days handling time.  Seller had 50% positive recent feedback but 200 positive historical reviews so I figured no big deal, just bad luck with a recent sale (only two recent feed backs received).  It was a Buy It Now with a Best Offer option.  I ask the seller a question and get a timely response so I float an offer that is accepted the same day.  I pay within an hour and within four hours a tracking number is uploaded.  I figure ""Great, item should be here next week.""

I have yet to receive the item as of today (5/31) and the uploaded tracking # has yet to show any tracking data.  I messaged the seller on Saturday when it didn't arrive by Ebay's estimations to ask about the package and got a response yesterday saying that tracking history should start appearing today.  Well today is almost over and nothing.  It is still being listed as in Pre-Shipment.

Should I file a not received claim and request a refund at this point?  Or should I give it another day or two to see if something shows up?  I realize it was a holiday weekend here in the US but starting to worry.  Appreciate any recommendations.",7,6,2016-06-01,EBAY,0.025207899510860443,0.9039779305458069,0.07081416994333267
Ebay,Buyer filed refund request to Ebay because they provided wrong shipping address,"Not sure how to proceed with this one. Guy buys a lot of CDs for $72 and I ship to the address provided. A couple weeks later (today), I get this message: 

""Hello, The address I gave you was incorrect. As such, the item was not delivered. May i request a refund? You may keep the shipping fee, but I need a refund for the amount I paid (cds). Please let me know""

I checked the tracking into and see that on May 20th, the item was marked as ""refused"" by USPS. I called the USPS and asked if it would come back to me even though it was media mail and they said yes, but with return postage due. 

I replied to the ""complaint."" 

""XXXX, Sorry about the address issue. The good news is that it was refused at the other address and is being shipped back to me. I called the post office and they said it will come back ""postage due,"" which means I will have to pay for the return shipping. Send me your correct address, and we can get that out to you when it gets here. If you check the tracking details, you will see that it says, ""REFUSED May-20-16, 10:44 AM, LOS ANGELES 90061"" Please immediately drop the pending case. When you did that, it tied up that ENTIRE amount on Paypal, which put me in a negative balance. That prevents me from shipping to 15 other customers that ordered items this weekend, which isn't fair to me or to those other customers. Thanks much, XXX""

They responded: ""hello, please provide the refund and we can just move on with the transaction. i cannot just close the case without any resolution. i cannot be assured of anything once this case is close. hope you understand. thank you""

So it sounds like they are actually holding the line wanting a full refund, which to me sounds absolutely ridiculous. 

Any idea on how Ebay will rule on this? I know they have a reputation of always ruling on the side of the customer, but this seems loony, right?",12,6,2016-06-01,EBAY,0.13092903792858124,0.8405462503433228,0.02852468565106392
Ebay,PayPal won't let me issue a refund to buyer,"PayPal limited my account  - with almost 100.00 in it, ugh.  And for a reason that doesn't apply to me.  Its limited so much that not only can I not withdraw funds, they won't let me refund the person who paid me for an item hours before PayPal limited me.  I called PayPal and they basically told me I was shit out of luck and to ask the buyer to file a dispute or file a chargeback.   WTF?

I'm working on eBay with it now.  I just spent about 20 minutes on the phone with them and they said the only thing that can be done so far is send the  buyer another message to respond to ""the cancel request"" - I never issued a cancellation since they had already paid.  I initiated a refund.  and the buyer is really pissed and has already opened a dispute and is threatening to neg me.  Has anyone ever encountered this problem before?  Were you able to get it resolved without losing money and getting a neg or lowered DSR?

Ebay,Sales have stopped abruptly - eBay Support is of no assistance.,"I've been selling since Oct 2015, have top rated status and on average do about $250.00 in sales per day which equates to about 15-20 items. The last week of May was especially good, with &gt; 300 per day each day! Things were really picking up I felt.

Yesterday I only had 3 sales, which I felt was odd, but thought that the holiday may be impacting sales. Come today however, and I've had 0 sales. 

I decided to contact eBay who praised me on my performance and was only able to confirm that my listings looked good, and there were no technical glitches or downtime occurring that could cause sales to drop. I asked to be transferred to Tier 2 support and they ended up transferring me to business development, where the rep attempted to tell me to adjust my listings. Blah.

I have experienced this once in the past, and it resolved itself after a few days without explanation.

My questions are:

1. Anyone else experiencing this today?
2. For individuals who have been in this game a while, is this normal? It feels like a substantial drop.

Ebay,Possible scam scenarios? (Step by step),"1) I am about to list and sell an item and value is $1000+.
2) Lets say it is sold and I get a  legit payment confirmation from Paypal.
3) Lets say the delivery address is confirmed.
4) I ship the item tracked and signed for.
5) The buyer signs it.

Any possible scam scenarios that can occur from here? I seem to have done everything I can to prevent a scam from happening, but has anyone got any suggestion?

I can think of:
1) Buyer says item was not as described/ damaged
2) Paypal has held on to the payment, and will not pay me until the buyer has confirmed he has received it or something like that.
3) Further down the line (eg a few weeks later) the buyer opens a case on paypal claiming something and paypal pays the buyer back my money

Ebay,Question regarding language of emails from Ebay,"Hello all, 

I made my Ebay account back in 2009 and didn't pay much attention to it until just few months ago. I have a verified address and everything works perfectly, but since I managed to create my account on Ebay.de (German version), all of the incoming emails, auctions' information and messages within the web itself (internal  cross communication between buyers/sellers) are in German language (I'm from the Czech Republic - neighbor states - so that was the reason I guess, yeah, I was stupid back then...).

I want to ask you guys whether it is possible to change the default language of Ebay and I'm simultaneously sorry for the ""noob"" question, but so far, I couldn't find any field titled ""language"" or something in the account/web settings.

  Hello all, I received the message below about a watch I sold over 2 months ago. Do I actually need to refund this guy? Without even receiving the item back? This seems like a ridiculous request.

Thanks for selling on eBay.
 
We were recently contacted by xxxxx about an issue with item #xxxxxx. He informed us that the item is not water resistant. Please send the buyer a replacement or issue a refund now. Also, please contact your buyer to work things out. Here on eBay, we’re confident that an open communication between trading partners is the best practice to resolve any issues.
 
Furthermore, being interactive with your customers will help you gain their trust and this will help you succeed here.
 
Thank you for your cooperation!
If the issue has already been resolved, please disregard this message.
This is a courtesy message to put you and the buyer in touch with one another to resolve an issue.  Please don't reply to this message as it was sent from a mailbox that isn't monitored.

Ebay,Beat an INAD return case on an item with NO returns accepted,"[Here](http://i.imgur.com/4puNoUo.jpg) is my back-and-forth with the buyer, earliest message at the bottom.  In summary: she claimed 10 / 400 quantity was missing, but then also went on to say she really hated them.  I replied saying INAD is not for buyer's remorse and I'd send her 15 additional just to be nice, and she replied again to reiterate just how much she didn't like them.

**Sellers take note**: Try to encourage your buyers to say why they don't like an item.  Buyers aren't always aware of this, but you're luring them into admitting remorse; so long as their complaints don't contradict your listing.


**Buyers take note**:  If you have a legitimate reason for an INAD case, only stick to the facts and don't include any superfluous comments about why you don't like the item.  Only comment on why the item differs from the description.


I called Ebay after the above messages &amp; the fellow put me on hold for 5 minutes, came back and said he would close it out in my favor.  I'm a bit lucky that her claim of short quantity didn't force a return, though I would have called back again and tried someone else.

Ebay,"Seller Talking in Circles, Wants Item Returned to Different Address.","So I bought a PS4 controller ""new"" (my a**e it was) and found that the analogue sticks were both a bit off, each with a different issue. So I contact the seller for a return.

First the seller asks if they can pay for a repair, which is of course unacceptable for an item that is supposed to be brand new. On top of this I can't find anywhere other than Sony itself that would perform repairs without messing with the warranty. I tell the seller this.

Then the seller offers me a £5 refund. Meaning I would have payed £30 for a broken controller. Also unacceptable.

Then the seller again offers to pay for a repair. I decline.

The seller asks for images of the fault. A fault that can't actually be seen. This went back and forth a few times before I sent them a picture. They seemed satisfied. 

Finally the seller (after over a week) tells me to ship it back to them for a refund. You would think, dear reader, that this is where the story ends, but it is not so.

When I bought the item it was located in England. The seller now wants me to send it to China. On top of this the seller is unable to provide one of those lovely printable postage slips, so I would have to spend a minimum of £35 (no tracking) to send the thing to China to get a total refund of £70, probably weeks after I originally raised the issue.

Ebay,"Received knockoff product, trying to return","I bought a Nintendo Wii U pro controller from Ebay for $16 dollars. Learned 10 minutes later that I bought a fake/copy item and tried to cancel the order only 10 minutes after I ordered it.

Ebay sends me a message saying they will try to cancel but only if the item hasn't shipped yet. 

Well, Two days later, I get an email saying my order has shipped. I know this seller had plenty of notice that I wanted to cancel but he shipped it anyway.

Ebay says free return shipping within 30 days. I got the order a few days ago and tried it out. I took photos showing why its a counterfeit product. and opened a Return ticket. 

Tonight I get a message from the seller via Ebay saying they are willing to refund half the money and I assume I would get to keep the item, but it doesn't mention what happens to the item.

Is he just trying to cut his losses, because a return would be more expensive to him than a 50% refund? Or is it something more fishy?",2,3,2016-06-04,EBAY,0.047077033668756485,0.8967410326004028,0.056181930005550385

Ebay,Another question about sniping,"Everybody seems to have a confident opinion about sniping -- that's when a buyer submits his last and best bid just seconds before the auction closes. It seems possible that my question will inspire a pointless and inconclusive on-line argument, with lots of strong opinions and anecdotal evidence on both sides. Still, let's give it a try.

I need a new, second-hand laptop, so eBay seems the best way to go. I've watched several auctions for the kind of machine I want, so I have a pretty good idea of the going price.

I just lost an auction. I thought the machine would go for about $500, and I didn't want to pay much more than that. A couple of days before the end of the auction I entered a maximum bid of $510. Someone bid $549 at the last second. Oh well, live and learn. Maybe I underestimated the going price for this kind of machine.

Now I'm bidding on a nearly identical machine, from the same seller. I've entered a maximum bid of $559, with about one day to go. For reasons I don't understand, this is below the seller's reserve price. (The reserve price on the previous machine was around $515, I think.)

Sometimes I wonder if I would be better off not bidding until the last instant, then submitting my maximum bid. But when I think this over, I'm not sure it makes more sense. If someone wants to pay more than $559, they can have it. I think they are paying a little too much, and there are plenty more machines where this came from.

Still, I wonder. If I'm really better off bidding at the last instant. If convinced, I would do that. I am a stingy bastard, as you can probably tell.

So, tell me what you think. I'm interested to here opinions, but well-reasoned arguments or positions backed by evidence will be more interesting.

Ebay,Removing account selling restrictions (insane eBay customer service),"So I have been an eBay seller for 18 years, sold 10,000 items for over $200,000, purchased at least as many items as well.   I have a 12,500+ 100% positive feedback rating.   

Now my account is restricted to selling:
	
You can sell up to 515 items or up to $5,700.00 per month, whichever comes first.
  	
Your June selling activity
Items	Amount	 
You have sold	40 $358.17
You have listed (active) 1055 $11,730.67
You can list	0  $0.00
You reached your selling limits for this month.

So in eBay's infinite wisdom, they have decided to punish me and prevent me from listing any additional items, despite the fact that I have all 5 star, 100% positive feedback with zero complaints from any customers.

Their reason?  Due to some issue with their site, items that I had already previously sold seem to have gotten relisted; therefore were out of stock when sold.   10 items out of 422 items sold I had to cancel the order on.  2.37% of orders in 3 months time.  In each case the customer was refunded within an hour, emailed an apology/explanation, and in every case the customer was perfectly fine with my resolution.  In some cases I had a different item that I shipped them for FREE (as in I refunded them + sent them a different item at no charge)

I have argued until my head felt like it would explode for over 2 hours on the phone to multiple eBay reps.   I found 1 of the listings where I definitely ended the listing last year (before item sold this year) due to expiration date of the toner and a report one I sold didn't print well.   I threw the items away after ending the listing (i have confirmation email where I ended the listing on Aug 28th.   Somehow this item got relisted in January with renew listing every 30-days automatically without my approval/request.  (ebay states it was with the web-based bulk relist tool) and sold in April, whereby I had to cancel the sale because obviously I didn't have any stock, since I asked it be de-listed last year!  - - so their excuse is well, we can't remove this item from your seller defect report even with proof because it's over 90 days old!  Well then how can you count it against me.

In a second case, the cable color was mislisted as yellow, when it was in fact blue, I not only refunded the customer, but sent them blue for free and they were beyond happy and left feedback as such.

If either of those 2 instances were removed, I would be under the 2% ""seller defect rating"" and my restriction could be lifted.   

I have begged to be reinstated since at least 1 mark against me is invalid, and I have begged to be reinstated just as a courtesy for being an excellent long-term customer.  

No matter what, they are un-bendable, and do not care.  I can't wait for a re-evaluation in 2 weeks, I need to get more items listed now.   This is my livelihood and how I feed my family.

It's wrong for eBay to punish one of their best sellers, when they have thousands of sellers sending out junk products, taking 10++ days to ship, refusing to honor warranties, etc.

I know we are always supposed to do what the customer wants, but I was not okay with paying them extra money to send something back to me that was apparently broke.


They ended up leaving me a bad review but, I was able to discuss with them further, and ended up resolving by refunding them half - $20, and letting them keep it. They went and left me a positive review instead.

Ebay,"Sold item, buyer says it was damaged, I offer full refund including shipping, he keeps item, leaves negative feedback then lists the item for sale in his own store for twice the price.","The title is basically the tl;dr, but there are so many other details that I keep coming across. For starters, a third party who follows the item in question which is very rare, sent me a note saying this person has done the same thing to many others in the past. His Ebay account is less than a year old so I can only guess he may have had other accounts in the past that were banned or he walked away from. 


He sent photos of the alleged damage, but they only appear as thumbnail photos. When you try to click on them, they go to a login for Ebay.it which is Ebay Italy. Everything about this transaction was done in the US so why would he be sending links to photos for Ebay Italy?


After he sent the first message stating the item was damaged, he asked how we should resolve this. I offered a full refund including return shipping, unconditionally. Short and sweet. His next response was the negative feedback. I then sent a reply saying that I agreed to a full refund and asked why he would leave negative feedback when I was fully cooperating. I said I was not aware of any damage when the item was shipped and that I could not see it in the photos. I told him to initiate the return and I would refund his money completely. 


His next reply was along the lines of, ""I sent you photos and you still deny the damage you are dishonest and I will keep the item and leave the review"". 


I then had to explain once again that I could not view the photos, etc. and asked him to retract his negative feedback and initiate the return. He then says, ""Ok, this sounds good, but I would like a partial refund of $250. That's when I noticed that he had listed the item for sale in his account at double what he paid for it. No more communications, no retraction of the neg feedback. 


I then called Ebay. Of course they refuse to take any action at all. My only option after the last correspondence was to report the buyer. The entire thing is beyond frustrating as this is my only negative after many years of being on Ebay. Looking through the buyer's account, he has left similar negative reviews for others, accusing them of shipping damaged items, and the sellers replied there was not.

For example, say this current month is June 2016 and my Transaction Defect Rate accounts for 6 out of 155 transactions (up to the period 31st of May) - Will the evaluation on 20th June include transactions made up to 20th June as well?

If this is not the case, then why? Why bother telling me, if we evaluated you today, you will be below standard? Is it because eBay is providing an opportunity to reverse that defect rate? I can't exactly fix a defect rate of cancelled items!

Ebay,"Crazy buyer, what should I do?","Hello, I have never posted on here before because I never needed to. I have been a seller for quite some time but NEVER had any problems, until recently. I sold a faulty phone on eBay, it was described perfectly, marked as not working/spares, and no refunds option was checked. HOWEVER, when I created the listing eBay put in the title that the phone is UNLOCKED, I am 50% that I have been using different network but I cant tell for sure, anyway I left UNLOCKED in the title. The problem with the phone was that the usb port was totally broken, not connecting/charging - basically it was loose.
The phone sold and I was waiting for the payment, before I received payment the buyer (after auction finished) sent me a question whether the phone works?? I said yes, he paid and I sent the phone (to the UK). This is where is goes nuts. I will post messages sent between us as I am sick and tired of this...

**buyer:**
Hi.you said that the phone is unlocked but phone is locked to 02 network why?

**me:**
Hi there, I had the phone working mainly on o2 card and it was also working with lycamobile as I was phoning my family abroad.
I don't know if it locked to any other networks as I used those two, I assumed it's unlocked to all. 


**buyer:**
When the phone is unlocked it can work worldwide.so this phone. Is locked network I can't use it because no use can't accept SIM cards. I am report you to eBay and I return the item.

**me:**
Hi, how did you manage to turn the phone on without taking in apart, how can I be sure that you havent damaged something else or swapped some parts?


**buyer:**
Hi.I never take it to repair charging port was tasted and is connect with power and to computer is also connect the problem is with the phone not sub port .the can work all faction with o2 network not worldwide the phone is locked and you tried to unlocked it because phones mast have 10 chances of unlock times but your phone was 5 chances of unlock times.charging port was described but not network so I can't use this phone because I bought unlocked phone not locked one.


&gt;At this point, he started a return through ebay.

**me:**

Hi, I have accepted your return. Please post the item to the following address:

\\my address\\

I will refund you once I get the item.


**buyer:**
Hi,my shipping company does not ship back items and the one ship back is fedex and their expensive they charge 40 pounds. So still losing more money .is not my fault for misteck it was good if the phone was unlocked not locked one .sending items from zambia to uk is not easy so i cant post your item is to expensive.

&gt;At this point, I thought, OK I will go to o2 and get it unlocked if it was actually locked

**me:**
Hi there. I have good news for you :) I have talked with the store where i purchased the phone and they will unlock the phone for you (remove simlock). I am waiting for the code to come to my email and i will send to you once i will have it. Is this okay with you? Please respond.


**buyer:**
Hi, that is good idea.you were supposed to do that after I let you know about the phone been locked.now have bought a code you come to that idea?I m going to send you a copy of where I bought a unlock code. And you should pay that amount to me.
Unlock network is not free if you still refuse what I m telling you now eBay will handle the case by 11-06-2016. Unlock code here is not free if you want I will send you the seller of unlock code from UK .and you can t get unlock code before get imi number for phone.so that unlock code that you are waiting is not unlock network code to unlock the phone you need to call me so that I dial *#06# to get Imi number for the phone. Code to unluck is XXXXXX.

**me:**
Hi there.

The code is free - so I don't have to pay you anything. You can close the return case now.
Thank you for your custom.


**buyer:**
The code is not free I bought the code not for free.and you said that you re waiting a code for the phone? How can you get the code do you know Imei number? Because you can t unlock the phone if you don t know Imei number for the phone.if you re saying that unlock code is for free then by 11-06-2016. EBay will handle your case have told you simple thing to do so that we close the case. will forward the transaction of unlock code and confirm to seller that I paid for the code no get code for free there sellers for unlock code just like you are selling phones.

&gt;end of conversation 

what you guys think? Surprisingly the code he sent me is correct, I have got the same from my operator, I don't know how he got the unlock code but as far I know with the new phones you need to contact the operator as calculators won't work. I just don't know what to do any more... I don't mind if he returns the phone, however it must have been taken apart to be fixed (turned on) but whatever... I will sell it again, this time 100% unlocked. 

Thanks

Ebay gave me 3 days to refund. I did not accept because I did not have my phone. However after 3 days Ebay automatically removed that money from my Paypal account. I called USPS and explained the problem and they told me the package was delivered to another address to the same neighbourhood that's why Ebay think I received the package as the only information available online are the name of the city and zip code of the city! also USPS told me there was no name on the package so legally anybody receive the package can open it!

Ebay,"Ebay automatically accepted a return for an item I sold for Parts/not working, route to take if buyer sends back a different item?","I listed a pair of high end graphics cards for parts/not working that came in a PC I bought which did not boot. I created the auction in the parts/not working category and vehemently stated many times even using capital letters in the auction description and title itself that I was not able to test the cards and they were being sold in untested condition as non-working for parts. I took clear pictures from all angles, and the auction got a few bids and the transaction went as it should.

Fast forward to yesterday when the buyer received the cards, he immediately files for a return without sending a message first. In his claim, he wrote that he got the cards to work, but is insisting the cards I sent him are of a completely different model many years older than what was in the auction. I am 100% sure that I sent him the right cards as it was the only completed auction I've had in well over a month and is the only package I've had to pack and ship out during that time, let alone the only pair of large expensive video cards I've ever had in my possession. I reply to his request and tell him that I can not accept returns for the cards since they were sold for parts/not working. 

Fast forward to this afternoon, I get home from work and log on to ebay and saw the claim updated with one of those 9 mile long messages from him going apeshit and still insisting that I sent him completely different cards. The only thing was I also noticed right above that notification in my inbox was a message from ebay that said ""You accepted a return"" and is instructing me to send him a shipping label. WTF?

I know what is going to happen as I've had parts swappers fraudulently use buyer protection to steal my items and return different things and even empty boxes occasionally throughout the years. I'm absolutely positive that this guy was able to get the video cards working properly, and is throwing a fake fit claiming the item doesn't match the description so he can return some old junk to me and end up with close to a thousand dollars worth of video cards for free. The chain of events is textbook for every time this has happened to me.

Ebay,*Update* Sometimes the good guys win. Ebay deleted the negative feedback and started an investigation into the seller's account,"Original thread here, https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/4n7cb1/sold_item_buyer_says_it_was_damaged_i_offer_full/



First off, let me give everyone here a huge round of thanks for your suggestions, ideas and encouragement. I took it all into account. I continued to do my research, exchanged messages with the other Ebayer who informed me of this seller's past. I messaged some others on Ebay who had sold to this person and were left negative reviews seemingly without merit. 



I then got on the phone with Ebay and started explaining and working my way up the chain. My tactic was to reach out to them and ask them for help. I asked how I should proceed. I never asked for the negative feedback to be removed, they actually brought it up. I wanted them to explain to me how to handle the situation. Without getting into too many details, the facts that got Ebay on my side were; buyer sent photos of the alleged damage, but they were too small to see and were linked to Ebay in another country; buyer got hostile in his reply after I simply offered a refund; buyer never initiated a return but instead listed the item for sale in his own account at more than twice the price he paid for it; buyer intimated that I could make him happy with a partial refund and hinted that he would retract the feedback in exchange for the refund. 



The final Ebay escalation agent who looked into the actual violations and removed the feedback said this was a clear case of competitor scamming (I forget the exact term he used as I was about to faint when he said the feedback would be removed) where the person leaves unwarranted negative feedback against Ebayers selling competing products. 



As I made probably 6-7 calls before getting to a rep in the US, I asked him if there was a way to escalate calls in the future if needed. I told him the other reps were helpful, but were a difficult to understand at time and didn't have much power to take any action. In short, there are no shortcuts. You simply have to make the calls, plead your case calmly and confidently and get Ebay on your side.",7,42,2016-06-10,EBAY,0.08345423638820648,0.8877347707748413,0.028811031952500343

Ebay,Am I understanding this policy correctly?,"I've noticed that if you need to cancel a transaction, even within 24 hours, you can take a pretty big hit on your ""seller level"".

We test everything before sending it out, and sometimes we find that the product isn't working as intended for whatever reason and we'll cancel it to save the hassle. However, I've noticed that if we were to ship it out and have the customer return the item -- we wouldn't take a direct hit. Our return rate would go up, but from what I've seen this doesn't negatively affect your account nearly as much as cancelling a transaction.

Delivery was a couple of days ago, and I get a message this morning. I'm hesitant to post the actual message, so I'll summarize:

* Machine looks good, with a couple of issues
* Machine is reporting it needs a new hard drive + battery
* The battery issue should have been mentioned in description ((But I didn't know this was an ""issue""))
* Hard drive needs to be replaced for ~$150, best price they could find ((no link included))
* Is a ""computer professional and can replace it for free""
* Would rather I refund the cost of drive instead of going through ""hassle and cost"" of returning it to me
* Hard drive error is hard to find, would have to boot into ""special program"" to find

They also attached a screenshot of this ""diagnostics"" but it's a phone photo of a screen, and illegible.

Ebay,Charge back on pp on item refused two months ago. Tracking says still in transit,"All the communications were done within ebay. I had a buyer who contacted that she no longer wanted the ebay item. At that point, I had already shipped the item, so I told her if she can send me $12.55 I could intercept the item. She didnt want to pay. So I said once she receives it, she can refuse it so it will be returned to me and she didn't have to pay the return shipping. The item was delivered on 4/7, refused on 4/11. I told her I will refund the money minus the original shipping as long as the item didn't get damaged.  Today I get a chargeback on paypal on this item, I traced the tracking, it says still in transit.  Since I am out of country, and I don't know how to call pp from overseas, I clicked "" resolve the case now"", provided tracking, and put the details in the note.

Ebay,Seller vs. Seller - a funny story/nightmare - whats yours?,"So smart me orders my supplies off eBay - packing supplies. Instead of calling ULINE like a normal person - I was extra stupid that day and ordered off eBay because I figured shipping would be much faster- and I was totally out of peanuts. {NOOO!!!}

So i find a seller with a ton of sales, place my order for expedited shipping for an extra 10 bucks - instead of the slow free economy shipping which was offered for no charge. 

2 weeks and my stuff arrives. By this time I am like a crack head on my front stoop looking around every five minutes to see where my mail is at. Finally it arrives and I see the seller had pocketed the extra shipping money and sent it economy instead.

Nice product - I am happy - but  WTH??

So I message up the seller, let them know I am very happy with the products, but hey can I get my ten bucks back?

Seller then tells me to open up a INR case....

huh???.....

A INR would be thrown out as soon as I post - leaving no case optional again. So I call eBay to find out what to do. 
eBay says its a violation of their rules to charge for expedited and not send the way which was paid, blah blah blah. ......

Not like they will do anything about that but ok.
However the eBay rep did tell me opening a INR case would nOT be correct. eBay rep says seller should just be proactive and go on their PayPal and refund there, since eBay really has no option to handle this on their site.
 
I relay this to the seller. 

Seller ignores me.

I get irritated. 

I message seller I will open the PayPal case for them... since they are busy?

I open the PayPal case under shipping cost dispute, only asking for the shipping cost returned and why.

Seller then suddenly springs back to life and responds something to the effect of ""buyer is a scammer."" and seller immediately escalates the case and PayPal tells me to PAY more to return all the items for a full refund.

I walk away from my computer at this point. Find the closest bar. And drink my irritation away.

Next day I close the PayPal case. I am not paying any more - I already over paid here and I like/need this stuff. 

I neg the seller - they deserve it - and doubt they will notice since they don't notice my pleas to resolve this problem

And let me say I HATED neggin the seller. It makes me uncomfortable. I know how big a deal it is to get a neg. But I feel like this may be my only way to get any chance of a fair shake. At the very least get them a ding to their DSR. And honestly - if I were this person I would fully expect a neg.

I message seller, explaining they can keep my money, which is not theirs but they must really need it, and keep their feedback they worked real hard to earn.

The seller tells me to open a new case to get a refund.

So now I am shaking my head. This person is so lost in the sauce. 
I explain no case can/will be opened, not after the PayPal one was screwed up and closed. I tell the seller they should salvage this sale experience and refund me what I over paid and we can work things out - hey we have all blown up once on eBay - maybe twice. 

Seller keeps insisting PayPal refund is ""unusual""

HUH? Are we on earth still?

Anyways I try explaining there is nothing odd about this but seller must be a conspiracy theorist. I cannot think of one dam reason a seller would be screwed for issuing a PayPal refund, it automatically updates on eBay.

Ebay,"Warning: Never give a refund you're not comfortable with, even if Ebay support tells you to.","I'm only posting this as a warning to other eBay sellers, not as a rant against eBay, so I believe I'm within the subreddit's rules.


In my scenario, I received a damaged item during a return and I contacted eBay for help. I was basically told to issue a refund or suffer a strike on my account. However, I was emailed a link to send in photos so I can appeal the case and was promised, **by the support agent**, that if I sent the refund and photos, I would not get a strike on my account.

Now cue forward a few days. I gave the refund and the photos, and during my call back, I was told that because I sent the refund, there was nothing eBay could do. Furthermore, I **also got a strike** on my account because I had contacted eBay for help.

So I not only lost money getting back an item I can't resell, I also got a strike on my account for following instructions given to me by eBay support. Now, I can't do anything about this anymore, but as a warning to other sellers:

### NEVER GIVE A REFUND IF YOU'RE NOT 100% SURE OF IT.

Had I not given the refund, the case would technically still be open and I can appeal the decision, but because I had given the refund, the case is closed and beyond resolution. Even if they threaten you with a strike on your account, **don't give the refund** cause you'll get a strike anyway at that point. It's better to leave the case open so you can appeal it and possibly remove the strike.

Ebay,Selling restricted for 30 days... for duplicate listings...,"I use a third party to list my items and I guess with 5k+ items, things can slip and I don't catch everything.  So this past month, eBay finds duplicate listings – all of a sudden.. after a year. 

 They don't ""suspend me because I'm reputable seller, but give me a warning"" then they finally ban me from selling for 7 days. I call, I complain, fight my case and nothing happened so I suck it up for a week.  A week later, I get suspended for 30 days.

And eBay can't and won't do anything about it.  Even after I tell them that I double checked all my listings and have no intention of circumventing anything by duplicating listings,  they don't care.  

So now I'm shit out of luck.   Might go stealth or something but seems a bit troublesome... then again I have no idea what eBay can or will do in the future.  Such a monopoly and can ruin a business like nothing happened. 

Anyways, I guess my point is to check your listings before you get banned for good like I'm about to.  Even if I do everything in my power to avoid duplicate listings or whatever else, it's highly possible that through human error I might have 1 or 2 duplicate listings for a minute and that will lead to a ban indefinitely.... and eBay won't hear any of it.

We appreciate your understanding.

I don't get why my account has been suspended. I've done some research and i tried answering here every question that came up on other threads.
I've created my account on the 10th of may and it's the first account i've ever created on ebay. I've paid my first purchase (530$ total using paypal) on the spot. It was delivered saturday. I've received this message right after i contacted the seller of my first purchase. I'm not a seller. I've never used ebay outside of this computer. And no one in my house has an ebay account. Our wifi is private and i do not have any vpn thing installed. I'm really running out of ideas on why my account would ever be suspended. What unnerved me the most is that the email didn't specify any method to make my account valid again.

Ebay,Impressions as it relates to search results.,"I'm having something kind of odd happen and wanted to check in with you all.

I recently began FB Dark Posting in an effort to promote my store and items.

I am getting a huge increase in traffic to my store (150%), but unfortunately not the level of return I would have hoped. I typically do between 200-250 in sales without marketing. And for the last several days my sales have all but completely stopped. I had a day where I did $45 (Very odd in terms of my trends), and another at $95. I haven't come close to hitting my daily goal the last 4 days (since I started my marketing campaigns)

In short, it appears ever since I started pushing traffic to my store and listings my sales have slowed down.

I've asked friends in other parts of the country to search for my listings, and they are able to find them, usually within the first 5 results on page 1, adding to my confusion.

Any thoughts? is it just a weird time for eBay sellers and my decision to begin marketing is in line with a normal slow down?",4,3,2016-06-13,EBAY,0.12521198391914368,0.8350585103034973,0.03972950205206871

Ebay,I may lose my TRS discount because USPS can't scan packages on time.,"Firstly, I'm grateful for the grace period. 

I have 1 day handling time. I use eBay labels. I always ship same day. I drop my packages at 3 different post offices. (Sometimes on the counter, sometimes in the package drop.) None of these post offices scan my packages. They sometimes get scanned in at the sort facility between midnight-5 AM. Sometimes it takes 2-3 days to go from the post office to the sort facility. (About a 30 minute drive.) My packages just sit unscanned for 2-3 days. There's no proof I actually shipped same business day. To eBay and the buyer, it looks like I just print the label then take it to the post office a few days later. 

- I have contacted my postmaster many times. They simply don't care. I'm not giving them any money, so they refuse to scan my packages at the post office. Complain they're short staffed, state I should buy my postage there, etc. 


- My printer can't handle bulk shipping. Is this the only way to get the SCAN form? 

- PO lines are typically 30 minutes to an hour. I could stand in that to get them to scan every package individually or the SCAN form. 

- I don't live in a safe neighborhood. My postman rarely comes. Mail delivery is late. When he does come, he throws packages at the door. Packages have been stolen a few times. Home pick-up isn't an option.

- I have contacted eBay multiple times asking why I'm being punished for USPS' mishaps. Their latest solution is for me to a hire a part time employee whose sole job is to stand in line at the post office get the packages scanned in. (My business isn't there yet.) 

- I have generic ""standard shipping"" marked on all of my listings - even the ones I know I'll ship Priority to allow the longer delivery window. Since USPS sits on packages for 2-3 days, they're STILL sometimes late. I could switch to economy, but I feel like that will turn buyers away? 

What are my other options? (Get a nicer printer and waste an hour of each day?)

I thought post offices used to get ""credit"" for scanning in all online shipping labels?",8,7,2016-06-15,EBAY,0.06347876787185669,0.9102801084518433,0.026241090148687363

Ebay,iPhone scammer,"So, long story short, I sold my first item through eBay and PayPal, it was an Iphone 6S. After a brief email conversation I did send the phone to the buyer. Since this was my first PayPal sell, the money would be held ""pending"" untill everything is resolved. 

Now, one day before the balance was supposed to be available I received a return claim from the scammer saying that the package was full of some old broken phones and he wants a refund. He's even gone as far as taking pictures with some broken motherboards and a box of some lousy Samsung, my actual shipment wrapper laying beside it. What's interesting is that when I look up the tracking number it says: Missed delivery - item being held - addressee being notified	

Of course I did take some precautions, taken some pictures of the shipment, of what's inside the box, the box in the post office as well, I do have a confirmation from the state-owned post office, and in addition I still have the receipt from the Apple Store which has all the details such as my name and the serial number of the device.

I know scammers win most of these battles (honestly I don't know why, I'm never going to use eBay for this again), but in my case how good would you say chances are that I keep the money?

From eBay's point of view, yes I could've scammed him but then again he could've obviously put the fake items inside the box once he got the shipment. But then again, I do have the same kind of pictures, as well as the PDF of the recepit with my name and the serial number.

Any advice?

**UPDATE**

So I have filed an official case at a Fraud Department of the british police. I'm just waiting for the Case ID now. How I think this scam works is, he wants to return the item to me (not the real one, naturally) and claim the money back. Here's the thing, I assume PayPal will give him back my pending payment BEFORE I even recive the item? Am I correct? 

It actually does matter because if the money will still be in my account before I receive the ""returned item"", I can at least hold on to it, instead of it being received to the thief straight away.",9,6,2016-06-15,EBAY,0.06459974497556686,0.9086447954177856,0.026755448430776596

Ebay,Buyer's trying to scam me; how should I handle this?,"So, on Saturday my item was ""delivered"" to the buyer (a new phone - insured and with signature confirmation).  

The problem?  He immediately opened a INAD case and send pictures of a completely different item (a broken phone) and a picture of a broken postal box with my label followed by messages accusing me of trying to scam him and requesting refund.

I call ebay and they tell me to follow though with his claim until the case is switched so they can analyse it.  So, I start asking questions ""who signed"" ""the package was delivered to your address"" ""here's the weight of the package I sent - inconsistent with the item you're showing""

He kept saying he didn't have it, so I went to T-Mobile to mark the phone as stolen.  A day after I do this he sents me a message claiming a police officer brought him the phone but that I'm trying to scam him because I didn't tell him it was IMEI locked (because I reported it stolen after he claimed he didn't have it - so, I ""assumed"" his package was stolen).

Now... my phone was unlocked, no need to be IMEI blocked if he didn't try to scam me; but now he has the correct phone so ebay allowed the return.  

He later says he just sent the phone alone and the cover I sent him and other hardware was stolen.  He'll send me an IMEI blocked, no charger, no cover phone after I sent him a fully unlocked, with charger, cover and a bonus gearVR.  

The phone's on the way.. but I can't sell the phone now that's blacklisted... what should I do in this case once it arrives?  Will ebay refund me the loss since the buyer's sending an incomplete package?

In addition to this, MyEbay does not show that I've paid! (ie, it shows the ""Pay now"" button.) So I can't leave feedback, and in fact, the seller might be able to complain that I never paid.

I am a little tempted to pay again and insist that the seller actually complete the sale, but it doesn't seem that ebay is giving me any leverage here to make any such demand.

Ebay,Would this idea work to prevent scams on iPhones and other Mac devices?,"I recently sold an iMac 27"". For the entire shipping and delivery time I was basically on pins and needles hoping I didn't get scammed. When I shipped, I informed the buyer that I had taken the iMac to a FedEx store so they could pack it properly and also so it there was a claim, they could verify the contents of the package as shipped. 

As it turned out, when I reset the system, I left a password on it. The buyer sent me an email about 30 minutes after receiving it and said it arrived in good shape and asked for the password.

So, it occurred to me that if, when selling Apple devices, the seller was to register them to his iCloud account and put a password on them, he could disable them in the event of a scammer purchasing them. 

If you informed the buyer of this in the listing and informed him to contact you after successful delivery for the password and so you can remove the iCloud lock, you could circumvent most scam attempts.

Ebay,I left neutral feedback for a seller and it was removed.,"Hi,

Let me start by saying Im not sure if I'm in the wrong or not. If I am, so be it.

So I bought an item(1 listing with multiple items) on buy it now. It was a fairly expensive purchase(~£130). The seller states in many paragraphs and large lettering that they throughly check everything they sell and quotes like:

&gt;  THERE WONT EVER BE  MISTAKE MADE AND A BUYER GET SOMETHING THEY DID NOT BUY

In fact it states 4 times in the description that all the items in the listing were original. The confidence in the listing and the seller is at an all time high. I actually bought 3 more of his items using a best offer.

I got the item(s) in the correct delivery time. But, one of the items is not as described, it was not an original, but a reissue.

Obviously this must have been a mistake, a seller who has been selling the type of items I am buying for a long time and such bold claims in the descriptions of their items would surely not send one on purpose.

So I contacted the seller and told him. Hoping it was a mistake. He immediately told me he can send me a refund for £10. Didn't ask for any evidence.

&gt; It was sold to me as original

Was part of the reply.

The way he worded the reply(and the other replies sounded like he knew exactly what he was doing.)

I took the £10 refund, then left neutral feedback.

&gt; Makes bold claims in the descriptions, some of them aren't true.

Was the feedback I gave. Its worth noting at this point that the seller also has(had) two other neutral feedbacks with similar experiences.

I got an email from ebay titled ""eBay account warning - policy"", this email told me that the feedback I had left was in violation of their feedback policy.

Was it wrong of me to leave that neutral feedback?

What should I do next? I don't want other unsuspecting or slightly less knowledgeable people falling for the same mistakes.

Your opinions good or bad are most welcome.

I call eBay after my shift ends/the next morning (I honestly forget, but it was ASAP), they explain I need to cancel the transactions and they will take care of the rest. I cancel each transaction, write message explaining what happened, and go on with my life.

Flash forward to four days ago, I find some extra comics I have that I figured I'd sell to help pay some upcoming bills. Go to list. Ebay pulls list, telling me my account is restricted and unable to sell, only buy. I'm confused. I email, and Trust &amp; Safety responds saying the restriction is justified due to my seller dashboard had dropped significantly below standards in February, when I myself have never sold anything. The only selling my account has ever done is when it was hacked. 

I respond asking to explain, since I have never sold anything, only when the hacking happened in December. I then call CS on the phone, and go through multiple people, who all agree that the hacking is clearly documented and I shouldn't have an issue since it is clearly shown that it is not my fault, and obvious I hadn't sold anything except for the hacking, which I called them for and had on record. The final (5th transfer of departments) person says they will have their superior look over everything and I should have 0 issues, due to again, it's obvious none of these transactions were me.

Now it's yesterday, they respond to me via ebay message saying, I quote, ""Upon further checking, please note that the information you've mentioned claiming that the account was hacked does not reflect with our records. In line with this, please note that the restriction placed on your account is permanent and final."" What? Every single person up till now has said it is obvious none of this was done by me. I have never sold anything. 

What am I supposed to do, or how should I respond to this? I have plenty of things to sell, and would prefer to use eBay, but this is ridiculous. Thank you for any or all help. ♥",8,7,2016-06-17,EBAY,0.1756746619939804,0.7903149127960205,0.03401046618819237

Seller has offered a refund but I'd have to pay return shipping. I don't want to pay anything since he didn't tell me he hadn't paid for the phone when I directly asked him that question.

Do I wait for eBay to step in? If they step in, will they accept the fact that I messaged him about it as proof that he wasn't honest with me even though it wasn't on his listing and then make him pay for everything?

Ebay,Little eBay rant.,"So I rarely sell stuff on eBay but over the last month I sold two golf clubs...never again. First club sells, receive good feedback that everything is ok, 2 days later receive a paypal dispute out of no where saying it is fake and I am to be reported to the RCMP and seller drops club off at local golf store also while demanding a refund and pretty much harassing me with messages like to ""come clean now buddy"" ""you know you ripped me off"" and so forth...thankfully this buyer realized how crazy he was and has ended the dispute but still getting accused of being a scammer etc did not feel nice and somehow he got the golf store to replace the driver I sent him with a brand new one even though there was nothing wrong with it at all.

The second golf club I sold the buyer originally seemed super reasonable and nice. I shipped the club out with UPS to florida, I am in Canada. Took 5 days to get there and I get a message saying that UPS had folded the box in half, snapping the drivers shaft, and I packed this thing good too. So the seller is understanding and I tell him to send me the one half of the golf club that can still be repaired (driver head). So the seller does and sends it off and as being a nice person I issued his refund once I got confirmation that USPS had picked up the package. I sent him a screenshot of the paypal transaction to let him know I issued it and that it should clear on June 20th. What I received in return was accusations that I ripped him off and that the refund is no where to be found and that he thinks I am scamming him. This proceeded for about 1.5 weeks of messages from this guy who apparently can't read or understand how Paypal works and that they held the refund till today. He even started demanding that I personally send him the amount he payed for the item through paypal and he would PROMISE to return the amount if the refund ever showed up...yea right bud. And finally the kicker to all of this, the guy sent the broken item returned from his Business shipping so he listed it as Merchandise that I HAD PURCHASED for $100 USD (I even told him to mark it as a return or gift and value it as zero because currently it is a broken golf club with zero value.) from him on the customs form so I got hit with $27 bucks in duty for a return of a broken item. I sent him a message saying thanks for the duty tax and he replied that I had never told him how to package it (i clearly did) and that this was my fault from the get go now claiming it was because of poor packaging, (cause I can control how UPS handles shit?). But whatever the refund went through today and at this point I want nothing to do with eBay ever again as a seller. 

tl;dr Used to be a prominent seller on eBay (like 4 years ago), returned after a hiatus to sell two golf clubs, two single handily worst experiences I have ever had on the site and with just horrible tempered people and frankly rude.

Ebay,My Personal eBay Horror Story,"I apologize for this incoming wall of text, but this is a story of how eBay perma-banned my seller account for an error made on their behalf. 

So this past January I found myself un-employed and decided to start cleaning out my basement and selling everything I could on eBay/craigslist. I made my first successful sale in the end of January and felt pretty happy, and quickly set my sights on unlocking the Paypal money hold that all new accounts have. This means you have to sell for 3 months, have 25 transactions, and they have to total 1k or some metric along those lines. I sold consistently for those three months and unlocked my instant payments at the end of March I believe. This part is sort of important: In early April, I had to leave town for the weekend for an emergency and I already had 3 items purchased from me that I was unable to send out. Because I wasn't going to be back in a timely manner, I canceled the purchases and refunded the buyers in full. None of the buyers had any issues, and they understood the situation completely. Regardless, this hit my account with 3 out of 4 ""faulty transactions"" since I had to cancel the listings after they were bought. I understood this, and took the hit to my account because I didn't really plan on ever getting a negative transaction again. 

Fast forward a month to May, someone purchases a blu-ray movie from me at the start of the month. I send out the movie with 2-day shipping to the address the buyer gave me (and added tracking details). I checked the tracker 2 days later, the package went out for delivery and was unable to be delivered. This happened every day for the next week, then the buyer opened a case against me for an un-received item. I participated fully, I notified the buyer that the tracking details clearly stated that it goes out for delivery and can't be delivered (more then likely because he/she gave me a wrong address). After a week, eBay swoops into this case, refunds the buyer the purchase amount (which I had already offered to do since it was 8 dollars), and hits my account with a 4th negative transaction. Heres the kicker- I checked eBay's reasoning- they said I never gave anybody a tracking number for the item. Not only did I do this twice, but I went and looked at the tracking number (through ebay, ironically) and the package was DELIVERED. It was clearly marked delivered several days before the buyer elevated the case. eBay didn't care, they ignored all of my seller details and tracking #, and gave the 4th strike.

The fun part: I call eBay customer support and ask why the case was decided against me. They say ""you never gave us a tracking #"", I then told her that I did, and she does some ""looking"" and finds that I actually gave them tracking details way before the case started. She also then sees that the item was clearly delivered, and politely offers to revert the decision of the case. I then ask ""Does this mean my seller status returns to normal?"" and she replies ""Yes, within 48 hours you will have fuller seller access again. Sorry for the issue."" Needless to say, that didn't happen. One week later I have to call eBay again, and they said I need to file an appeal with the closed accounts department. I do this and write out this huge story again, aaaand they say ""Sorry, still closing your account.""

When I started selling on eBay I was warned that they had terrible customer service. I wasn't ready for how bad it would be. I have an eBay rep ADMIT the sites mistake and I can't overturn a decision.

Ebay,How to set up a specific shipping condition?,"Hey folks. I've been reading over eBay's guide to setting up combined payments/shipping discounts, but I don't think I'm quite figuring out what I'm looking to do.

I sell individual trading cards an have normally offered free shipping. Due to market trends, I can no longer sell individual cards without eating a loss (after paying for stamps, ebay/Paypal fees, etc.) 

Listing the cards in lots isn't a viable option.

What I would like to do is set every individual listing to a set shipping fee (say, $1 - the items themselves are worth anywhere from $0.50 to $0.90) but if a buyer purchases x-amount of cards at once, it waives all shipping fees.

So for instance, I have 5 cards listed for $0.50 ea. Each card requires a minimum of 1 stamp, 1 envelope, and 1 hard plastic top loader. The cost of those things is about $0.50. So then after eBay and Paypal's fee, I would eat a loss. So I set shipping at $1. Buyers aren't very keen on paying a dollar for a card that costs fifty cents.

What I would like to do, though, is be able to set it so that if someone buys 3-5+ cards at a time, they pay no shipping cost. Since I can combine multiple cards in one envelope, I can cut my own shipping costs a bit.

I just can't figure out how to set it up in eBay. Do I just set it up as normal, and then just have it combine the orders automatically? It does that sometimes, but I've always offered free shipping, so I'm not sure how that affects shipping fees. Also, sometimes I've noticed that some buyers purchase multiple items and eBay auto-combines them, but then some other people will buy multiple individual cards, but eBay DOESN'T combine them.

## Why the heck does an item that ships from China show up in a ""Canada Only"" search and say that it is in ""Montreal, Canada"" ?

I found eBay's [**Item location misrepresentation policy**](http://pages.ebay.ca/help/policies/item-location.html), that explicitly states:

On the Item page there is a ""Report item"" button, that leads a report filing page and one of the available reasons is:

&gt; *The item location information in the listing may be misleading or doesn't match the description.*

Ebay,Paying two times for shipping with paypal? Please Help,"So yesterday I receive a funds release email.... It was for one transaction and notice it was for quite a bit less than I expected. I understand it should have been for the total amount - paypal fees as I paid for shipping upfront from my preexisting balance/bank account/CC through Paypal. 
 
I click on transaction details and notice that the amont also had the shipping charge of $2.60 subtracted. i thought that that was odd but maybe I can figure it out. I went back to my activity and saw that I had paid the $2.60 with my mastercard right after the sale was made. At that point I realized I paid for shipping on this transaction two times. 
 
I went back into other ""funds released"" emails and noticed the same thing every time. I went back for each individual transaction and saw how I paid for the shipping right after the sale was made. 
 
In the ""funds released"" email, I clicked on transaction details and I am able to see the deduction for the shipping charge and the tracking #. When i go back and find the original transaction for shipping I see it is the SAME tracking number every time. I cannot find any evidence of duplicate shipping labels. 
 
Today, my son helped me get some resolution. I had to speak to a supervisor after an hour but she realized what was going on and refunded me $2.60 for the transaction we spoke of and put a ticket in for my account to be reviewed. I have about 40 items I have paid shipping on and I suspect this has happened on every one. My son is having his account reviewed as well, he has even more activity. 
 
I am hoping that I have the preexisting matters resolved but I am also hoping that I do not have to deal with this in the future. Can anyone provide any insight on this matter?
 
Thank you!

Here are screenshots my son made for a $188 item he sold. The final amount he was released was $170.30 which is $188 - $5.75 (PP fee) - $11.95 (medium flat rate box)

Ebay,Beating an item with a long sales history,"Hi,

I am selling Google Cardboard VR Goggles on ebay, Australia. Now, my listing is very much the same as my main competitor but the only difference is that his listing has a history of nearly 2000 sold.

Now my views are low, I have loads of pictures, an optimised Title, have tried different catagories and still cannot get any traction with this item on Ebay. 

The rest of my products are selling ok, just not this one. 

It seems to me that the selling history of an item must sit very high up on the Cassini Search Algorithm, is there any way to get any traction in this situation?

Thanks,

Ken.",4,2,2016-06-23,EBAY,0.026099620386958122,0.8648335933685303,0.10906679183244705
Ebay,Question for Canadian sellers who cross border to ship goods,"I am a new seller on Ebay and just sold my first 2 items.

Ebay,Not quite sure what to do.,"I purchased a set of two figures from Japan. The figures are older and not in production anymore. They were listed as new and the seller has a spotless reputation.

I've now unboxed the figures and have found out that one of them is damaged. The inner shoulder joint is busted and the wrist is falling apart. Where my confusion comes from is whether I'm entitled to a refund or replacement.

Ebay,Bought a 2nd hand Wii U using buy it now. The package is not in good condition. Can I use ebay's 'money back Guarantee'?,"The seller did not mentioned:

1) The wii u controller is not original nintendo and is broken.

2) The game pad does not come with a charger

The seller's post only listed photo and have no description. It is marked as used so the standard description is 

""Used: An item that has been used previously. The item may have some signs of cosmetic wear, but is fully operational and functions as intended. This item may be a floor model or store return that has been used. See the seller’s listing for full details and description of any imperfections.""

The seller also say 'No Returns Accepted'. The seller has 100% positive feedback (103) . That's the main reason I bought using the 'buy it now' option.


What can I do with it? I paid via paypal. Should I go with 'money back Guarantee'?  How does it work? What is the catch?

Ebay,"Lost a $2,000 chargeback - What legal recourse do I have?","I am in Virginia and sold an item for $2,000 back in March to a fellow in Florida. In April they wanted to return it because it didn't fit and they altered it. I declined. They filed a chargeback and the funds have been in limbo since until just now.

Not only am I out the item and the $2,000. I'm out fees/shipping/materials/interest (from not having the money to pay off debt) that amounts to roughly $360 more

What kind of legal recourse do I have?

Naturally I did email the buyer with a simple request to mail the item back. Thats the first step.

The reasoning of the lost chargeback was that the credit card company saw the buyer opened a return case. However the reasoning for that return case was that the item doesn't fit. The reasoning for the chargeback was that the item was broken. So he blatantly lied and still won.",22,12,2016-06-25,EBAY,0.0568118616938591,0.9127687811851501,0.030419370159506798

Ebay,Considering cancelling a customer's order for the first time. Thoughts?,"Hey, all - 

I've been an eBay seller for 15+ years, and I've never cancelled a customer's order before. I am considering doing so this time because I sold an item and offered free shipping, specifying it was FedEx Ground or Home Delivery (I am using my corporate account) but the buyer's address is a PO box. FedEx does not deliver to PO boxes. 

Back in the day, I might have asked for an alternate address to ship to, but these days I am wary to do so because that voids any buyer protection offered by PayPal. I emailed the buyer explaining the situation and gave them an option of paying for media mail shipping, or cancelling the order. I have not heard back.

Would it be unreasonable of me to cancel their order and offer it to the next highest bidder? Can a buyer leave feedback if I cancel an order (if she later sees the email and realizes the order was cancelled)?

Ebay,I'm being scammed for over $2000 and there is nothing I can do about it (xpost from r/Flipping),"I sold my brand new Surface Book i7 laptop with warranty and lots of accessories for over 2k to a Best Offer. 

The guy had 0 feedback, which obviously I should have avoided, but after talking with him, verifying his address, and seeing his eBay account was 4 years old. I decided to go ahead with it while taking every precaution. Documented all serial numbers/Signature confirmation/Insurance etc. 

After two weeks exactly, he starts a return request saying the laptop doesn't work at all. 

The surface was bought new a month prior, and thus still well within the warranty which includes 24/7 support through Microsoft. I explained this to him and he responded saying he just wants full refund.

In the few messages he has sent me since, he has claimed several separate and unrelated issues. 

I am 100% certain the device isn't having whatever issue he is saying. Unless a brand new 3000$ machine randomly is completely shitting the bed just a month after purchase. Also keep in mind I had ZERO issues with it while I used it for a few weeks. 

________________________

So... I contacted eBay support today explaining the situation, and they said there is nothing they can do for me and advised me to accept the return and to relist the item. I'm obviously worried I'm going to receive an empty box back as the return, which I explained to the eBay support rep, who told me if that happens there really isn't anything they can do. 

The buyer here has Zero feedback and I have over 500 spanning 7 years with literally no negative or neutral feedback, I have a perfect history with eBay. Never even had a case get escalated before this.

Ebay,How likely is it that this person has scammed me?,"Okay, eBay, in my opinion, has gone way down hill over the past few months, it seems to be flooded with fake electronics. I've been scammed TWICE in the past month! I checked both user's feedback and they were fine. (Until I looked closer that is, when I noticed they were all generic) 

One thing I've noticed from both of them is that they don't respond to messages (maybe to keep the ""paper trail"" minimal?).

So, I won an auction on a PC monitor and won it for under half what it's worth. I've sent the seller 4 messages now asking whether it comes with a power supply included as they're pretty expensive. They haven't replied and the item still hasn't been marked as dispatch even though I won it on Sunday.

The seller had 2 of these monitors listed under separate auctions and I'm pretty sure that they bid on the first one using a sock account with an unreasonably high amount so I'd lose. (I and one other person were the only people watching it) I checked the history of the winner and it was a brand new account that had only ever bid on THAT monitor... and won. How serendipitous!

Anyway, I knew they had the 2nd monitor listed so sniped it at the last second. I was willing to pay up to £70 for it but the way auctions work it only went up to £35 + £10 postage.

Is ignoring messages a sign that they won't send it out? Or am I being overly paranoid after my recent misfortune? It seems weird that they'd ignore messages, they'd be getting alerts about the bids, about who won the auction and for how much, so in that same email account they'd be getting my messages too.

I need this item as I'm building a gaming PC for my 11 year old nieces birthday which is quickly approaching and so need this monitor or any other monitor this week! It's so frustrating when they just refuse to respond like this.",11,3,2016-06-28,EBAY,0.10765189677476883,0.8619399070739746,0.03040819615125656

Ebay,Pay to have an item reshipped?,"So, I recently won an auction for an item. The guy took like four days to ship it out, but I shrugged slightly at that because he shipped it as a priority package and I figured i'd still get it relatively quickly. Following the tracking, the mail is shown as 'delivered' but nothing. I check with my local post office, and they shrug because they have no idea if it was misdelivered or what. I contact the seller to let him know and then talk to a friend of mine who's a postal worker in a different part of the state. He looks into it and confirms it was misdelivered, tracking the GPS coordinates from the delivery (he can even give me the address it was delivered to).

The seller gets back to me two days later and confirms that the item was returned to him. He says he'll try to ship it back out. Next day, he comes to me saying that the his postal office insists that they delivered it properly, so he 'got what he paid for' and is saying that he wants me to pay him to ship it to me again. I'm talking to my friend from the post office who pretty much goes ""No, that's not how that works. Because he paid for priority, and it went to the wrong address, the post office is at fault, so I can take care of it if you give me the Post Office information and I can call to talk to them."" 

I talked to the Seller, and he's just going ""Nope, they want me to pay for it, so you have to pay me for it."" Despite me pointing out that all I need is the name of the post office that is telling him no so that my friend who's a higher up in the system can call them and sort it. He's pretty much just not responding to my messages now, expecting to just have me send him the money.

I can't tell if this guy is just being stubborn, or just trying to get the difference in the First Class shipping to make up for the difference in sell value (it's only about six bucks, but that's about the difference for what I paid and what the next lowest selling item is). Do I just bite the bullet and pay him for the shipping again, or is there something I should do to contact ebay about it?

Ebay,"Won eBay dispute as the seller, buyer requested my info from eBay and is now sending me threatening emails and phonecalls","Hi

I sold an item on eBay (digital goods, not covered by money back). Buyer used the item (I assume) and requested a refund. I was busy that day and didn't respond until the following day- during this period the buyer lost his marbles and send a torrent of abuse. I told him I would not communicate further and eventually eBay closed the despute in my favour as digital items are not covered under their returns.

At 1am last night he requested my info via eBay and called me twice with a load of threats and abuse and court on top, he said he runs a business and will sue the living shit out of me via that. I told him this is ridiculous and explained that eBay closed the case and to leave me alone.

This morning I have emails via his company email (Plumbing Service) threatening me with court. I'd like to note the value of the item was £12 and as far as I'm aware small claims court costs £50 to even enter the proceedings.

What can I do here? I'm not only afraid of what he will do with my info but really how volatile this guy really is. The address he has on me belongs to my elderly grandparents, a house which I only live at occasionally when visiting which doesn't help me feel better.

You know, when a seller sells a metaphorical ""shiny penny"" for a penny as an option on a metaphorical ""Luxury Car"" listing to appear as if with the lowest price.

I have some solutions if someone is listening, from easiest to hardest:

1. Add a search tick that filters lowest price as the MAXIMUM variation in the listing.

2. Make a rule, and ban sellers who are reported on this.

3. Same as 1, but as a full option on the drop down filters.

4. Same as 2, plus make a new type of listing allowing sellers to add accessories as an optional drop down. (Removes excuses)

This is what it looks like to me : http://i.imgur.com/hIh9DXE.png?1",2,3,2016-06-30,EBAY,0.031716421246528625,0.885749340057373,0.08253417164087296
