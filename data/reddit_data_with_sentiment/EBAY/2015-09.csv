Ebay,"PSA: If you become incapacitated or dead, do you have a back-up person to wrap up your account?","I'm posting this because of personal experience. My dad was a huge ebay buyer. He passed away 7/12/14. After all the craziness of his funeral, days later we checked his email. And we see his first closed UID for winning an auction the day he died.

My son was my backup for shipping and ending listings in case I became hospitalized (not a new thing for me). However, he is now studying for a CS degree out of state. I am just beginning to train my husband in these duties, but he is having difficulty with it.

Edited to add: My son took care of things during my last 2 hospitalizations like a champ. Business ran as usual without any problems.

What's your backup plan?",14,14,2015-09-01,EBAY,0.06839889287948608,0.9038055539131165,0.02779555693268776
Ebay,2300 Feedback 100% positive feedback account suspended,"Currently waiting on an email back from eBay on the fate of my powerseller account.  They just suspended the account took down 300 listings worth $16000

Here are the facts:
2300 feedback
10 year old ebay account
$250000 in lifetime sales
$30000 in sales past 2 months
100% positive feedback on 500 transactions
1200 successful transactions the past 2 months

Detailed seller rating:

4.9/5
4.9/5
4.9/5
5/5

Current defect rate:
4.5% on 808 transactions Projected level above standard
Defect rate last period 7% on 150 transactions
Defect rate previous 10 years: above standard
Defect rate this month: 1.2%

So essentially I slipped up for 2 weeks got the defect rate above 5%, immediately took action and I am on my way to top rated status within 3 weeks.  Based off my current growth rate I am heading for $600000 in sales this year.  IF they do end up keeping my account suspended it is absolutely ridiculous as it will be a loss in potentially millions of dollars in sales, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in eBay fees.  I don't understand why they ban sellers with 100% positive feedback from thousands of buyers.

Anyways this business is my income so if they account does get banned I will need to buy another powerseller account to continue my business.",19,12,2015-09-01,EBAY,0.16053406894207,0.8106503486633301,0.028815561905503273
Ebay,"Listed ""for parts or not working"" - buyer lied about condition of received item condition and forced return. Returned item 100% working. Can I open a claim?","Hello.

I sold a Galaxy S 5 listed as ""For Parts or Not Working"" and I stated in detail all of the defects. The phone was in perfect condition with only 1 exception that it would not charge the battery at all. You could still use an external charger to charge the battery directly.

Cutting a long story short. The buyer forced a return even though I stated that there would be no returns accepted, stating that the phone doesn't turn on at all. He said he tried with different batteries etc. and that he couldn't get the phone to respond at all.

I got the item back in the EXACT same condition as I sent it. I put a battery in it, and voil√° it turned on immediately and worked EXACTLY as described. All working except that it won't charge the battery (as I described in the listing!)

I haven't refunded the buyer yet but I want to open some kind of a claim. This guy wasted A MONTH of my time and money and kept the funds in escrow, and also my DSR dropped in this time due to the returns case.

What I would really like to do is send the item back AGAIN and simply keep the money that I got for the item. He bought it 100% fair and square and it was 100% clearly described in the listing.

I previously called eBay about this when he didn't respond for TWO WEEKS to the open returns case (he didn't return the item) and they said they couldn't close the case in my favour because he still had 2 days left to post the item (he posted it on the LAST day).

What can I do in this situation? I really don't want the buyer to get away with this. This is a clear case of 'buyers remorse' and lying about the condition of the item so you can open a SNAD in order to force a return and eventual refund.

**EDIT:** Prick was refunded. Just another situation where eBay forcibly bent over and mounted another seller. 7 years of selling on this site is enough. The only way I actually win and get to keep my dignity is if I stop selling on eBay altogether.",13,7,2015-09-01,EBAY,0.051348499953746796,0.9169624447822571,0.03168902546167374

Ebay,"Seller sold a product that stopped working after 5-7 days. Not sure what to expect, demand and how to proceed...","Hi,

So I'm really not sure what to make of this.
I bought a fairly cheap chinese soldering iron (6$  instead of 15$), it definitely wasn't the cheapest (2$-3$) but after several days of continual use it has stopped working.

I'm not sure what to make of this. If the same thing happened to me at a physical store I would have marched there and demand a replacement, this however is something different. I mean, the seller never actually promised that the product would work for a long time... I knew that I'm buying a generic product of mediocre-lowish quality (though I did pay more money than the minimum, under the assumption it would be reflected in the item itself)...

But 6 days?!

I contacted the seller and layed the problem, expecting... well I don't know what I was expecting, I guess I was hoping that he'll send a new one, in  return he replied with the usual chinese sellers pleasantries and expresses of sorrow after which he offered to reimburce me with 2 or 3$. 
Now I'm conflicted, I don't know what to do. On one hand it doesn't solve my problem,  I would need to spend more money to buy the same thing (possibly more expensive this time) and I wouldn't accept this in any physical store in my country- on the other hand... I don't know a) what is the practise? b) What are the reasonable expectations in a case like this? c) What are the chances of me getting what I want? d) Should I insist or just cut my losses and go?

Ebay,Buyer refused delivery of item and opened a case,"I've been selling and buying things on eBay for over 10 years now and I've never really had a bad experience. I currently have 600+ 100% feedback and mainly just have my account to resell things I don't need anymore. 

Last week I sold an eCertificate voucher to a guy with an account that's a few years old but with 0 feedback.... first mistake I made...

In my listing I clearly said that I will be emailing the certificate code along with mailing it. After he sends me payment, he tells me to not email it to him and just mail it. I didn't think too much into it.

I get the payment and I ship it via USPS Priority with Signature Confirmation to his confirmed address on eBay / PayPal. On the day he's supposed to receive it, the USPS tracker says ""Your item was refused by the addressee"" and that it is being returned to sender. 

I send the buyer a message on eBay and he starts going off on me about how he was home all day and never received any package and that I made a mistake or USPS made a mistake. I told him no, I did not make a mistake and it clearly states here that you refused shipment. 

I know that according to this link http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/money-back-guarantee.html
""Generally, the buyer is responsible for accepting the item when it arrives. If the buyer refuses delivery, their claim is not eligible for the eBay Money Back Guarantee.""
but the buyer is claiming that he or she never received the package... which I guess could happen but with the way the buyer is acting it seems more that he is trying to get out of paying for this item. In my 10+ years of selling goods on eBay, I have never made a mistake on the delivery address or have seen USPS make a mistake. I will know for sure once the item is delivered back to me. 

He immediately leaves me negative feedback saying he never received the item and that I'm not being helpful.... I offered to send the item back to him but now he is claiming that it is time sensitive and unless he has the physical certificate by later today, he wants a full refund. He also will not accept an email code of the certificate. Something fishy is going on. 

Has anyone gone through something like this before? Is there a chance I can get the negative feedback removed since it is not true? How will the case go?",18,12,2015-09-02,EBAY,0.07982629537582397,0.8905545473098755,0.029619120061397552

About 4 months ago a buyer left me negative feedback, my only one that I have ever received.

I did report the buyer to eBay with a well put together whine, and spent the next 4 months grumbling to myself about my 99.9% positive feedback and that one irritating and in my opinion unjustified neg.

Today, my feedback rating spontaneously increased by 1, the negative vanished, and I am back to 100%. Out of curiosity I looked up that buyer, and they are still a registered member with recent transactions, though the feedback in question does not show up under ""feedback left for others"" on their page.

Ebay,Customs sliced my book up,"I'm getting tired of making these threads but I love asking advice so I'm fully equipped to handle the situation.

I ordered an expensive (I.E. irreplaceable) novel from an international seller. During shipping, a knife sliced straight through the dust jacket and split it in twain. I contacted eBay customer service and they opened a case (without my permission) and said it's the seller's responsibility. I somewhat disagree. The seller didn't make that customs employee carelessly jam a knife through the packaging. They could have packaged better, however. 

I contacted the seller. They're responding in broken English and it's looking like it'll be a battle since they're asking me to close the case. The book was $175 and it's only insured for $45 (FedEx). I would be fine keeping the book as it's rare, but the dust jacket is typically 75-80% of any book's total value. 

How should I proceed?

Ebay,10 tips for successfully sourcing used clothes for eBay!,"Sep

 10 tips for successfully sourcing used clothes for eBay  




10 tips for successfully sourcing used clothes for eBay!


1. Go to the rich neighborhood's thrift store. Like it or not, this is the best place for you to find the best items to resale on eBay for a profit. The reason for this is that in the rich area the people who live there will donate their items when they no longer fit or when they no longer have the space for it.


2. Be Johnny on the spot. The more effort and time you spend hunting for the right styles the more success you will achieve. You reap what you sow, and this is no different. Don't expect to spend 30 minutes on a week end at a thrift and find all the scores. It doesn't work like that. You must be relentless in your search and leave no stone unturned. If this means going to 4 thrift stores a day 6 days a week then that is what it means. You never know when the thrift store has taken in a new item and is ready to take it out to the sales floor. 


3. Have the hunger. This goes with number 2. Are you willing to spend 45 minutes going up and down the t-shirt racks to find that one vintage rock band concert shirt that will sale for 75 bucks on eBay? You do if you have the hunger. When you are hungry to find the best scores you will inevitably push yourself to go the extra mile. Again, you reap what you sow.


4. Think outside of the box. Sometimes the best finds come when you least expect them. Maybe you are visiting a friend at a luxury apartment complex and notice his neighbors are moving out. Maybe you see them tossing bags of their clothing in the dumpster because they cannot haul all that across the country. Or maybe you spot a small clothing store going out of business. You walk in and make them an offer. Cash is king in these instances BTW. Many sellers have good luck buying NWT items at clearance stores and on clearance racks.


5. Know what you are doing and what you are looking for. Most clothing sellers know to look for items that are made with quality fabrics and have known and trusted brand names. 100% silk, 100% cashmere sweaters, and brand names that translate into good money (many of these brand names happen to be made in France or Italy). If you are sourcing vintage clothing then know what is popular. Always do your homework before you begin the hunt.


6. Leave no stone unturned. Thrift stores are lean pickings now days. If you really want to run a successful used clothing business on eBay you must be willing to scour your area. This means flea markets, garage sales, craigslist deals, estate sales, even going through your old clothes in the attic or basement.


7. Bring your magnifying glass. Not literally, but figuratively. One of the most frustrating things for sellers is when they find a score at the thrift store only to get the item home and ready to list and discover a hole in the garment. Bummer! Always check and then double check before buying an item!


8. Think ahead of the curve. One of the secrets to getting the scores is to go against the flow. During Summer when it is 90 degrees and other thrift shoppers are going through Summer dresses and t-shirts, you should be looking through the coat rack! Why? Because it is all a game of odds and chance. Chances are, your better finds will be in the places where others are not looking!


9. Know when to hold them and know when to fold them : stay on budget. The best resellers spend the least and make the most. I don't care how great those vintage leather Italian loafers you scored sold for on eBay if your profit margin isn't there. In the clothing resell world it is getting harder and harder to beat the thrift stores, but it can still be done. Staying on budget is key. This means using color coded sales at thrifts, not offering too much at estate sales, and haggling at garage sales. It is an art and you alone must learn it. Always look for the best deals at the lowest prices!


10. Use your devices! Technology has given us a great edge. Now days all you have to do is whip out your iPhone and check the sold / completed listings to see if that BCBG dress is worth buying. Use the tools we have available. Always seek to be efficient and organized. Stay focused, and you too can make big money selling used clothes on eBay!",9,5,2015-09-03,EBAY,0.045252785086631775,0.9142346978187561,0.040512565523386
Ebay,Receiving bid/message emails on an fraudulent item I didn't list,"This morning I woke up and checked my email to find several bid notifications for an item that I didn't list (it looks like a burned copy of the P90X program?) as well as a message from an interested buyer and a notice from ebay that they removed the item because it violates copyright.

Ebay,Can they get away with this?,"Hi, so I just ordered something from ebay.co.uk to be shipped to Norway.  I asked the company why it was cheaper to buy on ebay than their own site (I was originally going to buy on their site) and they said it was just due to competition.  I bought the item on ebay and payed ¬£60, s&amp;h included.  The company should have shipped today but instead we had this email conversation;

Them: ""To ship your order, we need to charge you another ¬£30.  If you don't like it, cancel.""

Me: ""OK, but this is just for customs clearance, right?""

Them:  ""We don't know anything about customs, if there might be a problem with customs then you should just cancel (she really mentioned cancelling in almost every sentence).""

Me:  ""I spoke to customs a long time ago, it's fine and they normally bill me directly for the V.A.T.  If this extra ¬£30 you want isn't for customs, I need you to properly justify the charge, otherwise I insist you ship the item now at the quoted price which I've already paid.""

So, ebay pros, how pissed off do you suppose I am about to have to get about this situation?  Thanks for any advice.

Ebay,I plan on suing eBay in small claims court.,"I plan on suing eBay in small claims court in Santa Clara county (their headquarters is down the street from my business). Small claims court are for claims up to $10000 in damages. I can easily claim this much damage, but all I will ask for is my account to be unrestricted.

Refer to this link as to why my account got suspended:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3jacck/2300_feedback_100_positive_feedback_account/




Damages:
eBay has prohibited 10's of thousands of dollars in sales, lost revenue, and wasted 100s of hours of labor, as well as investments.

My account currently follow all of eBay rules but was restricted for no good reason.

eBay sent me 1 single warning message ""your account is at risk for selling in the United States"" because my defect rate went above 5%. My defect rate was above 5% for 2 weeks and below 5% since. The incident happend 4 weeks ago, my defect rate has been 1% since then.

eBay needs to lay down their seller rules explicitly. Sellers need to know what eBay expects and the consequences if they don't. I followed all of eBay rules, my account is currently in good standing, and eBay blind sided me with an account restriction resulting in 10's of thousands of dollars in damages.

Perhaps if eBay sent a message, ""your account is not meeting our standards in defect rate, you have 3 weeks to fix this issue before your account is permanently suspended"". However, I got 1 vague message, got my account in good standing then was suspended 4 weeks later.

My account has $250000 in sales, 3500 transactions. Every single customer has been satisfied. With 1200 sales in the past two months I have 100% positive feedback on 500 transactions.

Ebay,"Asked for payment, buyer becomes extremely abusive.","Has anyone else run into issues with buyers becoming abusive when it's time to pay?

I accepted a buyer's offer within minutes, and they took 56+ hours to pay.

I ended up sending them one message a few hours after accepting their offer, asking them nicely to pay, and that I had accepted their offer. A day later I did basically the same thing. After 56+ hours or so of no payment I started a unpaid item claim. For what it's worth, the buyer has double the feedback I do (like 1400) They also sell items just like I do.

 They responded hours later saying. 

""Hello,

Honestly, I was so taken aback by your aggressive style of collecting a mere 13 dollars, that I've just been sitting back and watching all this unfold. Nowhere in your listing does is say anything about a time frame to pay, FYI. This means that the buyer should be able to expect a reasonable time. You were hounding me, a total of 6 times now, in 48 hours. 

Since you've gone and taken the trouble to open an unpaid item case, I'll gladly put doing so on my immediate action to-do list, in it's proper prioritized place, right after dusting my air vents and detail-shampooing my carpets. 

Thanks for your patience, I really need to keep my priorities straight in life.""



I responded, saying I was never trying to be aggressive, that I only sent them 2 messages, and that payment is expected after 48 hours as an eBay rule, unless they wanted an extension, I wished them good luck in cleaning their air vents and carpet... It escalated from there, and they became even nastier, saying I am lucky to live in the USA, and not some horrible country like China, or Indonesia (their words not mine).

I reported them, and called eBay after their 3rd message each being a paragraph+ long. eBay put a note on my account, but I fear they're going to leave neutral/negative, or give me low DSRs.

Ebay,"PSA: When you have tracking information on an order, upload it to eBay directly asap. It's not enough that you have tracking and can prove that the buyer has received their item.","I sold something a while back and it was sent via courier. Everything tracked and signature was obtained by the driver to prove that the item had been delivered to the address given. Then we get an email from the buyer saying that they had never received it and despite emails back and forth proving the delivery and a personal confirmation from the driver himself that the item had been delivered, the buyer kept demanding we send out more or to give them a full refund. All we could reply with was ""it's been delivered to the address you gave us, here's the confirmation. Sorry, we can't do anything"". This morning they leave negative feedback so I give eBay a call to see if I can get it removed, tracking information in hand. However, they can't touch it purely because the tracking information hadn't been posted directly to eBay on the order when it was all initially booked through. Apparently if that had been done then they could have whipped it off immediately.

Ebay,Can they get away with this (updated),"Hi, I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3jiidl/can_they_get_away_with_this/) very recently.  Now there's a different problem.  Seller wanted more money after the fact for shipping.  I called b.s. and refused to cancel.  The new problem is that the seller manually refunds my paypal payment, marking the order as unpaid.  So even if I refuse to cancel, I can never even get around to filing an item not received claim because the expected delivery date will constantly be pushed back.  If there was ever cause for witchhunting, this is it.

update; the kicker is that, after I refused to cancel, the seller lambasted me for 'causing them to incur costs' and told me I'm banned from their store.  Thanks everyone for the input.",5,2,2015-09-04,EBAY,0.2153007537126541,0.7565474510192871,0.02815181389451027
Ebay,Buyer left positive feedback then asked to return for item not as described.....,"Sold a big lot of Barbie clothes with several pictures (12) and the description saying they were in played with condition and may have marks or stains and the older ones may need repair.  Most of them were in good condition but I try to under promise and over deliver. I pointed out a stain on one of the hems of a gown, which was the worst of the lot. 
Buyer left positive feedback- just ""thanks"" and then the next day requested a refund saying it wasn't as listed.  Her message stated that she looked at them and felt they weren't nice.  
This is my first return request and somehow I ended up accepting the return.  I'm fine with having her return the items and giving her her money back but I hate being forced to pay return shipping because of buyer remorse.  
What happens now? I just wait for the box to arrive then refund the money or will EBay give it back to her automatically? Is there any way to only refund the purchase price and original shipping? 
Was there anything I could have done differently in this situation? I wanted to send her a message telling her the item WAS as described, just that she didn't care for it and I wasn't willing to pay return shipping for buyer remorse. My return policy states buyer pays return shipping but that isn't enforceable if they claim item isn't as listed.  
If this has happened to you,  how did you handle it and what was the outcome? Does this count as a defect on my account? When I check my dashboard, it says no open cases.

Ebay,Help advise please! Buyer returned different item. What can I do?,"I sold a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 tablet - it was black.
It was sold with original box and charger, etc...

Buyer opened a case immediately after he got it saying it is dead on arrival.  I paid for the postage label through ebay for the buyer to return it.
The buyer returned a different Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.
Its white - the one I sold was BLACK.  The serial number is different, and of course it won't even power up.  

I called ebay.  I got bounced around from operator to operator until finally I landed in the accounts department, and some guy named Alex, told me this:
""Why would the buyer return a different tablet, if the tablet you sent him didn't work?""

Maybe because he's a crook and had a broken tablet and got a replacement table for free!!!!!

I told him I can take pictures and show the tablet that was returned, but Alex asks me, what kind of proof does he have that the tablet I claim to have received returned is the actual tablet that was returned.
Ebay is saying I'm the one trying to commit fraud.

Ebay is blaming me!

Is there anything I can do?
The police department said this is a civil matter and they will not get involved.  They wouldn't even let me file a police report.
Tablet sold for 95$ with free shipping - that means I paid shipping/insurance (and also return shipping).  So I lost the tablet and shipping costs both ways!

Ebay,"Ebay pulling my listings as ""brand name misuse"", now for forum spite","I sold a jacket I had listed as a Batman cosplay jacket, as it was made to resemble the goon jackets from the 89 film. It was removed for ""brand name misuse,"" which is ridiculous.

The email stated ""Please understand that you listed generic item and also mentioned unrelated brand name ""Batman Joker "".""

It isn't generic; the patches are of the character.

I called Ebay and was told that ""Batman Joker"" (as if that is a thing on it's own) is a brand name rather than a trademark or copyright, and that by using it on a jacket listing, it implies the brand of the jacket is ""Batman Joker."" I told them that a trademark is different then a brand name, as a brand name can be trademarked but not all trademarks are brand names, and they told me I was wrong. I guess a phone jockey with a feeble grasp of the English language knows better than sellers.

I posted on the forum about it, and because Ebay's forum is insanely shitty, people there started reporting ALL of my auctions. I had three removed, two of which were items I bought in a store and sold.

Ebay,Is there any alternative for me other than to not quit ebay?,"Hello,

Background: Currently have a 15000 feedback business on ebayUK, this has been TRS for the past 3 years and does about 1000 transactions per month - this account everything runs smoothly selling used media.

I have a new flat pack furniture business, everyone has been very happy with the quality of the product and customer service in general, basically what i'm getting at is there is no real difference in these businesses on this surface level.


now the problem:
If you ship flat pack furniture it is quite different to other forms of selling on ebay, you're often mailing consignments of 30 pieces rather than a single product, also these 30 pieces are often more fragile - almost all wood. So breakages are going to happen no matter what. I know this as I have contacts who work at larger companies than mine with several million turnover per year, our breakages rates are similar.

However this doesn't work out on ebay because a lot of the time when something breaks in transit the buyer will immediately open a return request because of a chipped corner or because of a another reason like this. 9 times out of 10 they never actually want to return, they just want a replacement piece. This is no problem as it's part of the business, but I now have a defect.

So the question is what now? 
Customer support have already told me they can't remove it even though the buyers never actually wanted to return the item. Literally 100% of my defects are for this reason so I don't know what to do anymore other than quit.

Thanks.",0,3,2015-09-09,EBAY,0.07554980367422104,0.892938494682312,0.031511664390563965

Ebay,How to deal with frivilous returns???,"I sold some packs of Memorex Black CD-R's recently to the same person. I had two 10 packs listed and they bought them both. They were new and never used, essentially left over packs from a project I did several years back. I had originally purchased about 30 packs and had to go to two different stores to get enough, these are essentially the left over packs.

Anyhow, they want a refund because the disc in one pack has a slightly browner matte finish on the back label side. I tried to tell them it's probably manufacturing variances, but they seem determined I'm trying to rip them off by selling them disc that they claim were heated up. Here is a photo they sent me of one disc from each pack side by side http://i.imgur.com/LyilPEj.jpg.

I did a little research and found this [website](https://sixohthree.com/295/cdr) that documents changes in the Memorex Black CD-Rs, and sure enough there were both a brown matte and a shiny gold finish manufactured by different companies for Memorex. I think their claim is a bit of a stretch and unfair that they want to return them because the color/finish is slightly different. Never in their claim did they say they don't work or they are broken, their claim has been exclusively based on the color/finish, and that in one package each disc was individually wrapped, and in the other they weren't, which to me also seems like a manufacturing variance.

If I give them a refund it's a complete loss. If I give them a return shipping label and then refund after I see the product, it's an even bigger loss, because it would be hard to resell opened CD-Rs. Honestly I feel this is a frivolous refund request. Ebay already has a hold on my money to cover this, and I don't see any options to dispute it. Is this a situation where I'm pretty much screwed and forced to give a refund?

I've read about small claims being abused and sellers getting the shaft, however, this is my first run in with something like this.

Ebay,"Rant! eBay buyer opens a return case for shipping damage, as a seller he should know better.","I sold an amp on Monday evening. Shipped it first thing on Tuesday. I had to use USPS because the buyer had a PO box. I prefer to use FedEx, they tend to take better care of packages and are a bit cheaper. The buyer has 1600+ FB, quite a bit of it is as a seller. Rather than asking for a street address to ship to, I just paid the extra few bucks and shipped it USPS. I figured the buyer would appreciate the speed.

So, it arrives today and apparently, the USPS used it for a football. A few of the knobs are damaged, etc. So, rather than just emailing me, the buyer opens a return case, giving me a defect.

Seller gets it in two days, three days total from the order date, as doesn't have the courtesy to message me before opening a case. I almost expect this kind of shit from the buyer with low feedback, but a seller knows he is giving me a defect. That's just shitty.

Ebay,Lack of info from eBay regarding open claim,"Hi,

I'm having an issue with eBay after selling an item and I'm looking for some help. I sold an item a few weeks ago and the transaction went fine. That is until the item got lost in transit. The tracking number with the postal system showed no information beyond that they had received the item information from when I printed the label online.

After two weeks of discussion with the buyer, they started an 'item not received' claim with eBay. I was away camping for a week without internet access when the case was lodged and saw that it had opened and closed without my even knowing about it.

It turned out that eBay had ruled in favor of the buyer and refunded their money. EBay refunded the money before the item arrived, while the tracking was still saying 'in transit'. I checked the tracking info and saw that the item has since found its way back into the system while I was away and is now being shown as delivered. So now the buyer has both the item and the money.

I took the tracking information and appealed eBay's ruling. After the given 48 hour response time I received an email from eBay stating that they still needed more time to make a decision. That was a week ago now and I've not heard anything more. 

The case information page gives no more information after that date. I also can't see anywhere on there where I can contact eBay for an update. I tried opening a new case for an unpaid item, but eBay won't let me open a new case when there is already one being reviewed.

What are my options? What can I do from here to get my payment?",4,2,2015-09-10,EBAY,0.04951450973749161,0.921186089515686,0.029299452900886536

We leave each other good feedback. She never gets it, and tries to insist as it's been signed for, that I pay for it.
I'm not paying for something I don't have, and was her mistake in the first place.

She says she's starting a royal mail investigation, fine by me, it'll all get sorted, I think. Well, she just messaged me saying that they've had an investigation. And they can't find it. So I'd better pay for it or she's taking it further, as she has proof I signed for it. 

Which it was first signed for by my mail center, and then later by me with a batch of 15 packages. She can't raise an ebay case against me, but is threatening to ""take it further"".

Thanks.",0,2,2015-09-10,EBAY,0.026746230199933052,0.885396420955658,0.08785734325647354
Ebay,Is deleting my account the best thing to do here?,"Part 1: 

About a month ago, my eBay account was compromised. Whoever got into my account placed 15 items up for sale and made it so that the payments went to their PayPal. I started getting notifications that my items (which were some weird exercise DVDs. The title even had misspelled words in it) were selling, which was really weird because my account is only used for buying! So I freaked out and called eBay customer service. After a lot of being put on hold and repeating myself a bunch, I was told that the items would be removed from my store, any money I owed ebay was ignired, any transactions that were made would be refunded/canceled, and the people who bought the item would be notified that my account was compromised. And thank goodness, when I checked my account, there was nothing up for sale.

Part 2: 

A week or two passes, and I get a request from someone who bought the bogus item saying that they did not receive their item even though their payment went through. I was really confused because as I said before, I was told transactions would be canceled and users would be notified. I explained this to the person and they decide to file a claim against me. So I call customer service, and after being transfered all over the place, they refunded the customer since my account was compromised. At this point, I'm considering deleting my account because this is all getting to be more annoying that its worth. 

Part 3:

Today, almost a month later, I get a claim from someone else saying they paid for the item, never received it, and want a refund. I'm honestly not in the mood to deal with this again. If I knew this was the last time I have to do it, then I wouldn't mind it. But I have no idea how many people purchased the item since eBay deleted them from my account. I'm thinking the only thing I can do now to keep from having to go through this again is just delete my account. EBay didn't do as they said they did and I don't feel like its worth it to keep using this account anymore. 

I plan on making sure the customer gets their refund, but after that would the best thing for me to do be to delete my account? If there are other customers who bought the bogus item and their payment went through, what will they do if my account is deleted?? *sorry if the formating is messed up, I'm on mobile*",5,7,2015-09-11,EBAY,0.06578747183084488,0.9107896685600281,0.023422811180353165

Ebay,Laughing at this chargeback...(Storytime-TLDR at the bottom),"So I guess I just feel like venting so feel free to read or ignore-I am just getting a good laugh out of this.   
  
I started selling on eBay not that long ago (March of this year). After reading some of the stories posted on /r/eBay, I was just waiting for the day someone would attempt to scam me or dispute a transaction. If there is one thing I have learned form here, it is that these types of situations are pretty much bound to happen (especially to new sellers with hardly any feedback).  
  
As someone with 0 feedback, my first mistake was listing a Michael Kors bag. It's almost like I was asking to be ripped off.  
  
Anyway, on May 13 I had someone do a ""Buy it Now"" on this particular bag. Mind you, it was an auction starting significantly lower than the Buy it Now price. This kind of threw me off guard, but I thought, hey, maybe the buyer just doesn't want to wait until the auction ends for me to ship it out.  
  
I looked at the buyers information: Brand new eBay account (one of the randomized names) with 0 feedback. Okay...so this is the first time this has been the case for me. All my sales at this point had only been to buyers with 200+ feedback. *I won't use the buyers real name-let's just say for the story's sake that the buyers name was T Carter.*  
  
First thing I did was Google the buyer's name and city. It wasn't hard to find her Facebook page as it was the top listed link on Google. Then, I Googled just the address. I found some sort of page that lists people who reside in the home. It listed off names: T Carter (the buyer), J Carter, B Carter..I think there was a few other Carter's there but I can't remember off of the top of my head (*again, not the real names I am just using it for the story*).  
  
So far everything seems to be matching, so I am feeling comfortable enough to ship this thing out. I had never required a signature for shipping before, but the little bit of doubt in me told me to get signature confirmation this time around. Anyway, the item ships, is delivered, I don't hear anything from the buyer for a few weeks (which turns into months). Everything seems to have worked out just fine.  
  
Lol okay yeah no just kidding.  
  
This morning I received an email from PayPal stating someone had done a chargeback stating unauthorized use of their credit card. I did not even have to look at who it was-I knew right away it was going to be T Carter. I looked at the email...who would've guessed?! T Carter is filing a chargeback! At this point I had a bad feeling in my stomach + laughing at the time time because I knew this was going to happen, however this is the first time I am dealing with a chargeback, and I wasn't expecting it nearly 4 months later.  
  
Obviously since this just happened this morning, I don't have a complete resolution. I knew I had to send the tracking info to PayPal so I pulled it up on USPS's website. I FORGOT that this was the only transaction I required a signature for, so I nearly fell off my chair laughing when I saw it was signed by ""CARTER.""  
  
Of course, who knows...maybe some teenager used their parent's credit card without permission (but again I am going to go with my gut like I did in the beginning and say...probably not). Oh well. I guess we will see how this pans out for T Carter.  
  
**TLDR;** *Felt weird about a buyer and required signature confirmation for the first and only time I've had to. Four months later she does a chargeback stating unauthorized use of card. Checked tracking info and not-so-bright buyer has her name written all over the signature confirmation.*",14,6,2015-09-11,EBAY,0.05110664293169975,0.9161317348480225,0.0327615849673748

Ebay,Sales Plummeting - Seeking veteran help,"So I've been beating my head against a wall lately trying to desperately figure out why my sales have been taking a steep nose dive. It has been extremely frustrating and the wife looks at me and says ""surely there is an eBay subreddit"".

I've been an eBay seller for about a year and a half now and was doing reasonably well. I am at 100% feedback for the past 12 months, Top Rated Seller and used to average about $12k-$15K a month in sales. Over the past 60 days or so that has plummeted to $3500. There is a definite influx of additional sellers in the market for my product, except on a handful of items I've made sure I remain competitively priced. If you sort by price+shipping I usually hold the top spot as well as many of the listings on the first page. However, if you search and leave it sorted by best match, I'm not anywhere on the first 15 pages. This is despite 100% feedback, despite the eBay store subscription, despite the Top Rated Seller. Yet somehow new sellers with 90% feedback and no store subscription are on the first page. I called eBay support to see if they could help me understand what was happening and the only advice I got was the that first 4 words of the title carried the most weight. So I went back and revised all of my listings to more closely match my competitors and it has had no impact on my sales. I've started adding some other additional new listings to try and drive up traffic that way, but no matter what I do, sales just get worse with each passing day.

Worth noting is that I can see through feedback research that my competitors continue to sell the same products sometimes at even higher prices while I continue to stifle.

Ebay,Buyer won't lay off!,"I have an item for sale for $5.99, cheap.  I'm on one coast, potential buyer is on the other coast.

It would be nice to get rid of this item since it is heavy and sort of large but they've sent me 2 offers, both of which trying to get me to knock shipping off.  Essentially, if I were to do that, I would be paying them to buy my item.  Should I block them?

Ebay,How to handle this buyer?,"I'm new to eBay and never sold anything prior to this, so please excuse me if this is off base.

I'm moving in a few weeks and during my cleaning and packing, I discovered my high school band instruments. I gave two away to friends who wanted them, but was left with my oboe and figured, hey, might as well ask for something since I'm never using it again. So I set it up and put a Buy It Now price of $500. I originally purchased it for $3300. I noted that it was used and would most likely need a little work because it hadn't been used since 2009. It was purchased brand new in 2008.

So I get a message from a woman interested in it, and she asked me to call her to coordinate some stuff. Then she asks if I could lower the Buy It Now price. I dropped it to $350 just because I just wanted it gone. Moving is hectic enough without things I don't need. I reiterate to this woman that it'll need a little work regarding key alignment and pads, but will be playable. She says it's all right, and buys it. I shipped soon after.

She got it yesterday afternoon, and apparently the whole ""needs a little work"" thing somehow got forgotten. She sent me like 8 long texts talking about how this was the most disappointing experience she's ever had on eBay or Craigslist or anything, and ranting about how sad her daughter was that she couldn't play. Then, some time later, she texts me AGAIN with a whole novel about how they're working on adjusting it and it's playing a little bit. That's when I was finally able to check my phone and I was overwhelmed by all the messages and ranting.

I was 100% up front with everything and hid nothing, but I'm still getting texts and such from her. I'm just a person selling a high school band instrument because I don't need it anymore, and she's making me feel like I should hire a customer service department.

Ebay,Items lost(sort of?) while posting internationally,"Hello,

I'm after a bit of advice as a buyer. I purchased an item in the U.S that was sent to my country in Europe, then routed to another European country. The item is currently in that countries customs. The item has a value of about $1000 and has been in the other countries customs for 14 days.

U.S -&gt; My country -&gt; Other Country -&gt; Other countries customs

When I noticed the strange behavior on the tracking I immediately messaged the seller. They remarked they had not seen this before, but were sure I would eventually get the item.

I've been checking with my post office every 2-3 days since I noticed the tracking error. They have no tracking on the item entering my country.

A week later I opened a dispute with the seller that I have not received my item when it was two days passed the initial delivery date. I've kept the seller up to date when I poke the post office.

The seller has a perfect rating with about 1000 feedback, but they seem very insistent that I close the dispute until I get my item. This is my first dispute that I may need to request a refund, so doing a quick search tells me closing the dispute is the last thing I should do.

Has any of the experienced sellers/buyers here seen this behavior on tracking before?

At the moment I am leaning towards a refund since I can't trust the item will ever show up at my door.

I've just asked the seller to verify the address and that I have the correct tracking number for this item.

If I do get a refund can I easily get the funds back to the seller if the item arrives? Is there an option for ebay to hold the funds for a month in case I get the item?

Ebay,I'm not selling very well. I have lots of watchers but no buyers!,"It's my first time selling on eBay. I am selling five high-quality, brand new items that I bought and didn't need (they are buy it now items). I have sold two so far, quite early on.

Two of the items (a popular UK brand wall art canvas in its original packaging, and a popular worldwide brand coat) have 17 and 8 watchers respectively and both have over 350 views (not sure if that's a lot for a 30 day listing that ends in 15 days).  

Unfortunately, I just can't shift them. I had an offer made on the coat that was well below my asking price and it's worth a lot more than I'm selling it for so I had to decline. A user complained about the shipping cost for the canvas but it is the cheapest shipping option that I can find in the UK for its size and I would rather not pay for shipping out of my pocket as I'm a poor student just trying to avoid making a loss.  

I have not overpriced any of the items but am I perhaps still being too greedy by asking for near the price I paid for it?

Ebay,Seller being ripped off by ebay,"This is a follow up to a post I made the other day. You can see the [original post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3kdgio/lack_of_info_from_ebay_regarding_open_claim/)

I should have clarified in my previous post, I'm in Australia. So the carrier is AusPost. I also ship using eBay's prepaid shipping bags they have setup in partnership with AusPost. These have tracking that is automatically linked to the eBay site as well as requiring signature on delivery.

Anyway, after two weeks since the last contact from eBay, I finally found a contact page on the website to request an update on the status of my appeal. So I sent a message. A few hours later I received an email from an eBay employee apologizing for the delay but informing me my appeal had been approved and would be processed shortly. A few hours later (just now) I logged into eBay to see the status of my case has been updated. I went to have a look and saw that, despite what I was earlier told by the eBay employee, my case had been updated but my appeal was denied.

I immediately replied to the eBay employee's email asking them to explain. I'm currently waiting on a response, but as we're well out of business hours here, I'll likely have to wait until tomorrow. But what else can I do?

I can't see the justice in this. There is proof in the tracking that the buyer has received the item. EBay has also granted the buyer a full refund. How is that an appropriate outcome!? In the message I insisted that the issue be escalated to someone who can overturn this because I won't accept this outcome. I don't know if it'll work. But right now I'm just furious.

Can people please offer advice on what I can do? The item, including shipping, was only worth AU$25, but that's not really the point. Right now I feel completely ripped off by eBay and powerless. 

UPDATE: I just received a response to my email from a different customer service rep. (I guess it all just gets delivered to a pool). This person says they don't know why I was told it would be approved, but they've checked and it has indeed been denied. They say that because the item wasn't delivered until after the decision was made that it can't be overturned. They also suggested I contact the buyer to ask for repayment. I responded by questioning why EBay would make a refund decision while the tracking indicated the item was in transit. Yet to get a response. I also sent a message to the buyer requesting repayment.

Ebay,Package was intercepted?,"So, I shipped out a package yesterday that was supposed to be en route to MA, which is fairly close to me, about 4 hours. I'm looking at tracking and the last status was 'Arrived at USPS Origin Facility' after that I see an update this morning saying 'Delivery status not updated'. I called USPS and they said the receiver had it intercepted. With all the scammers on eBay, I'm kind of worried. This guy has been a member since Aug with 1 positive feedback that seemed legit from a long time seller and we also communicated before he bought it as well. I checked and the address is real, as well as the person. When I called USPS, they said it he had it intercepted and they asked if he had moved or something? We both seemed a little confused, so she had written down some notes and filed a case, the post office it's being delivered to I guess will check it and call back.

 I'm just wondering if I should be worried or am I just being a tad paranoid?",4,10,2015-09-18,EBAY,0.11555222421884537,0.8308398127555847,0.053607963025569916
Ebay,buyer requests return because they didnt read the description,"Buyer says that they didn't read what I put in the description, and mistakenly bid thinking something the item was a different ""kind"".  They want a return because it isn't what they expected, even though they freely admit I wrote it crystal clear black and white in the description.  They just don't want it anymore. 

I have No Returns on my listing, but I guess that's a joke.  
Interestingly, the item they were expecting to receive doesn't even exist.  I'm obviously dealing with ignorance.

Is this something I bite the bullet on to avoid the headache?  The safety and standard of my seller's account is what is most important, so whatever the best path for that is the one I want to take.

Ebay,A whole mess of a situation. Need some advice.,"&gt;Incoming wall of text. There is TL;DR at the bottom but I could really use some advice. Sorry!

About 2 1/2 months ago, I purchased a collectible anime figure for around $160. The seller had it advertised as 100% authentic as there are a ton of bootlegs listed on eBay so I thought I'd get it since I'd been looking for it for a while.

I received it fine but had instant buyer's remorse after. I opened the box to make sure the figure was actually in there but never removed it from the plastic to get a closer look at it. I put the box in my closet and forgot about it. I had been a figure buying craze this year and didn't have anywhere to put it so I figured I'd wait until I got another shelf to display it.

Fast forward to this week. I've been saving to move across country fairly soon so, to make some extra needed money, I'm going through my collection and selling off most of my figures in /r/AnimeFigures. This one came up and the buyer wanted me to make sure it was authentic. I opened it up and, low and behold, it was a bootleg. 100% fake and awful quality. I contacted the original seller and asked if he would consider a refund knowing full well that since it has been so long, he wouldn't but I'd try my luck.

He didn't. He instantly accused me of being a scammer and liar. I told him I could provide proof of it being a knock off. He claimed I bought a bootleg, swapped it, and am now trying to scam him. I said I'd be in contact with eBay and he was passive, mean, and basically told me, go f myself and to bring my worst.

eBay could see all the messages when I was talking to them. They unfortunately couldn't do anything because it was past 30 days but told me to contact PayPal since they have a 90 day policy. Got in contact and had them start a claim investigation on the purchase which is still in progress.

Also, after the initial message from me asking for a refund, the seller purchased a $1 Xbox game I was selling.. coincidentally. I went looking for the game but found it missing from its case so I had to cancel the order. He, as I expected, sent me negative revenge feedback ‚Äì just to spite me and ruin my 100% positive as I highly doubt he had any intention of leaving me positive feedback whether I sent him the game or not. Sophomoric but I'll get over it. I also found it ironic that someone who thinks I'm trying to scam him still chose to buy something from me.

Thing is, he also has 100% positive feedback which leads me to believe he didn't even know he didn't have an authentic. But strangely, the auction was listed as used with only a picture of the box; no pictures of the figure itself. I figured someone trying to differentiate themselves from the number of bootlegs would at least prove it with some photo evidence. Something I failed to notice when I initially purchased it.

I'm just wondering if I'm handling this situation correctly? Should I have even bothered starting a claim? If it wasn't such an expensive purchase, I wouldn't of done a thing and shrugged it off but bootlegs of this figure sell for 1/4 what I paid.

Lesson learned to check my purchases more thoroughly and I'm out a decent chunk of change, I guess.

**TL;DR: Bought a expensive figure off eBay. Seller claimed it was authentic. Stuck in closet for 2 months without taking it out of plastic. Go to sell it to a redditor this week. Find out it's a bootleg. Contact seller. Sh*t storm ensues. PayPal claim investigation started. Seller leaves revenge negative feedback.

Ebay,Anyone else have trouble transferring money from paypal to bank account?,"I've been having a lot of trouble transferring money from my paypal account into my bank account. Every time I try to make a transfer, this cycle happens:   
1. I click ""transfer money to bank"" and enter the amount.  
2. the Paypal site says ""something went wrong. we need you to use our classic site"".  
3. I click the link and I'm redirected, and enter the withdrawal request on the classic site.  
4. It asks to verify my identity by sending me a security code in a text/phone call. (Even though I've verified probably 20 times before).  
5. It accepts the verification, but then redirects me back to the new site, where I'm asked to sign in again.  
6. I click ""transfer money to bank"" on the new site and get sent to step #2, where the cycle repeats.

The fact that this is such an old problem makes me somewhat suspicious - I almost think paypal does this on purpose to discourage people from withdrawing money from them (basically giving them a free/0% interest rate loan from their users.)

Ebay,"Raging So Hard, just here to vent. Purchased a House of Staunton Luxury Board on eBay but seller refuses to give me a refund.","Let me preface this by saying that I hate biased opinions. I think there are two sides to every story, but there are instances where the other side just makes no sense.


I ended up purchasing the following board through eBay and won it with a best offer of $450. Below is the description from the seller, and it says brand new, pristine condition and the wood combo is purpleheart and curly maple:

&gt; House of Staunton handmade chess board. Wood is Purple Heart and Curly Maple with 2.5 inch squares. The board was made in February of 2007. Never used and pristine. Part of a collection. Price online is $895. Buy it now for 525.00.  Reasonable best offer will be considered. Will ship to one lucky buyer UPS Ground within 2 days of verified payment. Happy bidding.  




I received the board on Thursday and I was incredibly disappointed. I sent the an email to the seller and included the following pictures:

* http://i.imgur.com/LIe5LPv.jpg

* http://i.imgur.com/i6xcHm8.jpg

* http://i.imgur.com/qBDbaR1.jpg

The three main problems are:


* The wood isn't correct. The light squares are not curly maple. Unless you're blind, the wood is birdseye maple. 
* there are some severe scratches on the board
* the frame to board fitment is for lack of a better word, shit. HoS boards should sit flush with the frame but on this board, there is a huge gap on one side and there is a nasty rotten wood area that is visible. I don't doubt the board is a legit HoS board, but this is appalling.

I don't think this guy understands eBay's money back guarantee policy, and it's quite infuriating. If the item is not as described, the seller must accept a return and cover shipping.

Ebay,Help! Shipped $1500+ item to buyer who after messaged their address was incorrect!,"Background:


Hi I'm asking here since there's still 6 hours until eBay customer service will be open and I am freaking out.


I am a first time seller, who just sold a very expensive (for me at least) piece of equipment for over $1500.


I shipped the item a couple hours after the payment was received to the paypal address which matched the ebay address.


I come home to discover this person messaged me 10 minutes later that paypal had the wrong address and they provided a different address.

I do have a tracking number, but I was only able to purchase a maximum of $1000 insurance... so obviously it getting lost really concerns me. I also just noticed that even though I asked at the post office for the $1.50 signature option it is NOT on my receipt. :( The item is now gone, so that's too late to change.


I am definitely really concerned now if this a scam or not, and regardless if it is... what does this mean for me? 

My questions: 

1. What happens if the person who DOES live at the ""incorrect"" address accepts my package and it doesn't get returned to me? I am from Canada and shipped to the USA so I had to declare the contents and value on the package. 

2. Will I have to refund the buyer, even if it doesn't get sent back to me by the post? (ie. the resident living there see's a $1600 item and just accepts it, or in the case it simply gets lost and undelivered to anybody :/).


Kinda freaking out since I've been googling this a lot and people have reported having to refund the buyer even when the package never got returned to them in this situation!",9,11,2015-09-23,EBAY,0.1422225832939148,0.8259928226470947,0.03178458660840988

I get a bid almost immediately, and several hours later get a question from the bidder asking if one of the bushings is included. He says he's only buying it for that bushing. I inform him that, as he can see in the picture, it is included. He then sends another message saying to make sure its included, like in the picture.

My auction stated no returns for what it's worth.

I'm concerned that if I offer a refund I'm going to a) be out of pocket for the postage from sending it, and b) probably receive a brick/broken phone/empty box.

Ebay,Cancelling After Unpaid Request,"Hi guys! First Reddit post, kind of nervous here...

Ok, so I sell items on eBay for a shop and I've been doing it for about a year. I still get terrible anxiety about top dollar sales and feedback. I try to be as honest as possible and it works out for the most part. So I have a question about an iPhone 6 Plus I have posted. I checked the IMEI, model, and inside the settings to see which carrier it belongs to - all items point to Verizon. Inside the settings of the phone it does say ""Verizon 20.0"" as the carrier. I sold this item and after waiting for payment for quite a while I opened an Unpaid Item case. Almost immediately after opening the case, the winner of the auction contacts me saying that the phone isn't Verizon and asking to cancel the order. I know it is too late to cancel it since the Unpaid Case had already been opened. My main concern is, what if the buyer is right and it's not a Verizon phone? What can I do to confirm this? And what could happen if the buyer is correct and leaves feedback based on the fact that I didn't cancel the order for him/her (I'm worried about if he/she happens to pay for the item then leave feedback)?

My gut instinct tells me that he just regrets bidding on this item because it was sold as ""Bad ESN.""

Ebay,Item never arrived yet eBay decided the case in seller's favour,"Hello,

I purchased a jacket from the US eBay (I live in Australia). 

Sadly, the item never arrived. I contacted my postal service and they told me that the item was never delivered to my address and has been returned to sender. Tracking shows it ended up in the Alexandria Post Office - not my suburb - after attempted deliveries. The Post Office informed me that in the case that mail fails to be delivered to me it will be taken to the ABBOTSFORD Post Office - my local post office - to be collected. On top of this, the postman will leave a note telling the recipient of the package to come to the local post office to collect it. I didn't get this either. It seems to have been delivered to the wrong address through postal or seller error.

So I applied for a refund through the Resolution Center but the seller just said they had done everything they had to do as a seller and denied the request.

The seller requested that eBay step in to resolve the problem, claimed the item was delivered, and the case was decided in their favor, the eBay comment stating ""We received tracking information from the seller that shows the item was delivered to your address.""

I messaged eBay customer support, explaining the situation and received this message back: ""Upon checking the tracking details of the said item, we can see in our end that the parcel was attempted to be delivered delivery. As you may know, we considered attempted delivery as delivered."" 

So attempted delivery to the wrong address counts as delivery? 

I think what contributed to this is that the tracking on eBay is [less detailed](http://i.imgur.com/EIq8v8W.png) compared to the [Australia Post tracking](http://i.imgur.com/PSkrCnx.png) which actually shows the location of the item. The Post Office employees told me that the seller had most likely written the address on the label incorrectly.

Also the seller told me that they would contact me when the item had been returned back to them so they could send it back out if I agreed to pay the postage again. This was about a month ago (more than enough time for the item to be returned to them) and still they have not responded.

What are my options now to recover the money? Going through PayPal perhaps?

Thanks!",10,6,2015-09-25,EBAY,0.20496179163455963,0.7698314785957336,0.025206752121448517

Ebay,Postage Due?,"I'd like to thank /r/ebay for the help with the return procedure for the counterfeit ticket that I bought.

I have since bought another ticket for the event, which is on Tuesday.  However, the expected delivery date was today.  USPS said the expected delivery date was Thursday, but I guess eBay knows the USPS better than the USPS knows itself.

Anyway, the mailman brought the envelope, but refused to deliver it because there was postage due.

The mailman wrote out a ""Sorry We Missed You"" card with the address as written on the envelope.  My roommates didn't know whether it was for me (I didn't tell them) so they just took the card.

The card said that there is $3.61 postage due.  The ""Available to Pick-Up After"" date is Monday.  I will pay for and pick up the envelope on Monday (and hope that this ticket is not counterfeit too; the seller's feedback is very good, so it's unlikely to be counterfeit) but how would I go about the postage due?

Ebay,Should eBay take seller history into account when deciding cases?,"I was just reading another thread from this subreddit regarding a guy who had a buyer run the old I got a box of bricks scam. Surprisingly this is pretty much a guranteed way for a buyer to get a high dollar item and their money back and seller really has no way to fight this kind of fraud. Assuming a buyer does it once and doesn't make a pattern of doing it they will get away with it everytime.

The poster said ebay acknolwedged a 6 year spotless history but none the less sided with the buyer. It brought up an itneresting point, should eBay take your seller history into account when deciding issues like this?

Say you have 5 or 10 years stellar reputation and a new buyer tries to run game like this, should eBay side with the seller with a solid history of no issues over a buyer?

Common sense would dictate yes, however I have a feeling eBay would rather have 100 sellers unrightfully get screwed even when even they are probably pretty sure the buyer is running game as opposed to having even one buyer get screwed as they are all about providing a ""positive buying experience.""

Ebay,How to prove seller shipped to bogus address,"Out of the hundreds of purchases I've made on eBay, 3 of them the seller shipped to an address in my zip code that wasn't mine.  I'm signed up for my.usps.com so I know what is coming my way and I get enough packages with tracking daily that I know when they were delivered.

One package I have no idea where it went.

One package went to an abandoned/for sale house with slightly similar address.  The house number was the same and the street name started with the same letter.  They said the hand wrote the address and handed it to the USPS teller. The seller eventually refunded me so I'm assuming this was an honest mistake or they knew they were caught.  Though the abandoned house scheme is pretty common.

Another instance had the seller shipping something to a business with an address not even remotely close to my ebay/paypal address.

Ebay,Need help with potential scam,"The back story here is somewhat personal so bear with me. 

My father passed away a few months back, however we keep receiving eBay items to our house that he could not have possibly ordered, nor were they listed in his eBay purchases.

The issue here is that the buyer on the packing slip somehow got a hold of personal contact information and is sending emails to my late father's email address asking for the items to be shipped to him.

We called eBay to deactivate the account and asked what to do with the packages and they suggested sending them to the seller, however I personally am really wary of the buyer requesting the items to be sent to him or her.
What do I do?",2,3,2015-09-28,EBAY,0.07301332801580429,0.9006186723709106,0.02636798284947872

Ebay,"I'm selling a new watch, but it needs a new battery. If I get it professionally serviced for a new battery, is the watch now considered ""used""?","title.  I don't know how picky watch collectors are when it comes to this kind of thing (this particular watch is pretty rare although likely worth &lt;$100). I acquired this watch years ago but never used it.  The battery died and can only be replaced by a jeweler who possesses the proper tools to pry off the metal plate on the back.  My question is, if a jeweler opens it up does that make the watch ""used""?  If I sold it as new and the buyer finds evidence it was serviced, would I be screwed?

Ebay,Buyer files Item Not as Described. Throws product in dumpster &amp; wants refund,"It's an old scam but a good one. 


The buyer haggled the price of a a high value item (in this case, vintage cosmetics). As the seller, I accepted a middle ground best offer and includes extra samples in the package. Buyer received the item last night and proceeds to send 7+ messages within three hours claiming the items are 1. used, 2. old therefore unsanitary, 3. given to me free therefore not worth the High value and 4. overall disgusting. They demand a full refund. I apologize that the item were not to their satisfaction and ask them to return the product so I could issue a refund. Buyer then claims the cosmetics are broken up and they threw them in the dumpster. It's impossible to send pictures of the condition, let alone send the products back. As a seller, I never accept returns but after speaking to two eBay escalation reps advised that I accept the return anyway. If the buyer is unable to ship the item in seven business days, I win the case and the hold on my PayPal funds are released. But the eBay rep stated the Buyer can claim the cosmetics broke during shipping or if the returned package is broken cosmetics, the Buyer can still win the case and I could file and appeal. Or I could file a claim with USPS. Both options usually go nowhere. 


The buyer seems to be throwing many excuses so they can keep the product and I'm very concerned that eBay's new policies will allow it. As of now, I am waiting for the shipping label sent to the buyer will be used. What can I do in the meantime to help my case? The claims page allows me to upload pictures to help my case but I'm not sure what else I can add. The listing had hi-resolution pictures showing the items were brand new and the description stated it was vintage cosmetics. 


**Update:** Now the buyer is ""willing to forgive"" the broken item and is requesting a partial refund for the ""non-broken"" items. eBay rep advised to *not* respond to any further messages from the buyer and wait it out. See if the buyer prints the label and returns the items. Is there a department higher than escalations that can handle this claim?

We use this condition religiously when accepting returns because of the issues we've had issues with people following it when returning items (for the record, we are a no-return store, but I have the buyers claiming fake defectives on me pretty regularly).

Are there any other sellers that have this issue, or am I just a stickler?

I won and paid off for an item on Ebay on Friday, but haven't received a notification of shipment yet, so I'm wondering if it's normal for it to take a while or if something's up.

Am I overthinking this? Or do I have a legitimate means to contact the seller and raise a dispute after 3 days?
