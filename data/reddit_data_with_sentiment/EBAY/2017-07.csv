Ebay,Buyer asking me to change shipping and asking price before he will buy it.,"I'm selling a graphics card with a starting bid of $200, a buy-it-now of $270.

&gt;ok deal

&gt;100$ price and 150$ shipping, i need to declare lower price, in sum you'l get 250 and i'l make fast payment

Ebay,Seller sends empty video game case,"I recently bought a bundle of games from someone, with one of the more valuable games in the bundle turning out to just being an empty case. The seller apologized and claimed they had checked all the games before sending them. He offered me a refund but nowhere near enough to cover the cost (sneakily using an avg cost per game instead of the price for a loose disc of the concrete game, and ignored it when I pointed that out to him). I'm not really interested in spending time going back and forth trying to discuss a price and it's not really worth the time shipping it back either. Id rather leave bad feedback and maybe spare someone else a bad experience than taking the very small refund i'm being offered. My question is if there is anything else I should do in a case like this like contacting Ebay, or if leaving poor feedback explaining the situation is enough in itself?

Ebay,"Buyer lied about item, requested a refund and is now trying to sell the item on Poshmark.","Yesterday I received a request to return a dress I sold.  I knew she was trying to scam me because she said there were ink marks on the dress that were not in the listing.  This dress was new, with tags and in pristine condition.  It is a very rare dress and it was the only one for sale that I could find on Google.  

Anyway, I accept the return request.  Then later last night I had another buyer purchase something so I went on my Paypal to make sure she paid.  That's when I see that the gal who requested the refund also filed a dispute with Paypal.  I looked at the email address that was on the dispute and went looking for info on her on the internet.  Then lo and behold I find her on Poshmark trying to sell the dress I sold her for a much higher price.  I was furious!  I called Ebay and reported her.  They said that it was fraud and they were going to close her account and that after July 10th I would get all my money back if she does not return the dress.

I noticed when she purchased the item that she only had 1 transaction and it was a new account.  I was immediately concerned but went ahead with the order.  I am now very suspicious of people with 0 to 1 transactions.  Can I cancel them in the future?

I used to be a Power Seller, but I have not sold anything for 4 years - until recently when I decided to sell again.  As little as 4 years ago I was never scammed.

Ebay,"Need advice, what would you do?","Bought a $500 electronic item from a seller, descibed as used very little, almost like new.  Cosmetic condition in the pics was very good.

I get the item and there is a broken component.  The broken component was not visible in the auction pics because it's small, plus the angle of the pic.  And one might not notice it if looking at the item IRL.

The broken component is more cosmetic than functional, though it could lead to functional problems down the line (but I dont think so).  Getting it fixed at a local repair shop would cost minimum $200, maybe 3-400, because opening up the unit is time consuming.

The main issue for me is that I would have bid much less had I known about this.  And if I decide to sell this item at some point, I will lose money.  I estimate that it's probably worth about $150 less than what I paid with this issue

I contacted the seller, he apologized, said he didn't see it, said he will ""get it fixed"".  I emailed him back and asked him how and he said he's a tech and he will try and find the schematics.  Communication has been ok, not great.  So he's going to want me to ship it back to him (he's on the west coast, I'm on the east), shipping is at least $60 each way.

My preferred outcome would be he partially refunds me $150 bucks and I just live with it the way it is.  I want to use this item now and don't want to deal with shipping it back (it's big and heavy), waiting for him to fix it etc.

TL;DR: Item not as described.  Seller wants me to ship it back so he can fix it. I just want a partial refund.",10,6,2017-07-02,EBAY,0.059497784823179245,0.8999931812286377,0.04050896316766739

Ebay,dishonest car seller,"Trying to save a buck, I bought a 2014 Honda Accord exl with 42 k miles and a rebuilt title on eBay in January for $10,100 plus shipping.
The seller's ad represented, ""the car runs and drives as it should, no problems."" The seller was a dealer who also repairs cars. His shop was over a 1000 miles away in Florida. He had nearly perfect feedback and I had the car inspected. The inspector was a national service. They said the car was mechanically sound but did show signs of bondo which didn't faze me.
When I took possession of the car, I was very disappointed. it made a terrible grinding noise when I turned the wheel hard to the left. (I had to replace rack and pinion for $1700 - the Honda dealer wanted even more!) when I contacted the seller he told me it was not his problem, must have happened in transit. He was dismissive and mocked me since he already had my money. I know his shop cut corners repairing the car and passed it off as being professionally repaired.
The car has been one headache after another as I fixed what I thought he had repaired. The seller lied but it is difficult to prove and I freely acknowledge I did knowingly buy a rebuilt titled car. I'm Into the car for almost 4 grand. At least now it actually runs and drives up to my expectations.
Anyway, My mechanic discovered this week that the passenger curtain airbag was activated in the accident. The seller's repair was to cut out the airbag and not to replace it all since airbags can quite expensive. That has to be illegal, right??
Somehow, when my inspection as well as the state inspection was done , the air bag light was not on. Even after I took possession, 25 percent of the time the airbag warning light was not lit making me think it was just a faulty sensor.
I have pictures of the spot where the deployed air bag was cut. My mechanic will sign an affidavit. I know the seller was aware of this fraud since his shop repaired the car. He also fraudulently represented the repairs to the state of Florida in order to obtain a rebuilt title.
I emailed the seller to offer one chance to compensate me 4 grand or I would go to the authorities and I would I sue him. He again mocked me and told me to go screw myself. He thinks since 5 months have passed he should get away with his actions.
I am asking the reddit community to help me expose this guy. I want notify Ebay, the Florida DMV, the bbb, the attorney general and every consumer advocate on tv and in print in Miami of the business practices of this shop in their community.
My plan is to send registered letters to anyone and everyone I can in Miami documenting my experience with this guy.
I would love to have a local lawyer take a small claims court case on contingency but that seems like fantasy. I have the time and the commitment to make the effort to bring this guy's actions to the light of day and maybe save someone else the trouble I experienced. I am going to do it.

Ebay,Listings pulled again. What can I do to prevent this?,"Three times now, my listings have been pulled for violating shipping policy. I ship live animals and eBay requires one day shipping. *All* of my live animal listings are one day shipping. So when I call eBay they look up the listings, see that, yes they were all listed correctly, then refer the case to someone else to review. It takes 1-3 days for all of this to happen before my listings are restored. And by ""restored"" I mean the title only. The pictures and descriptions are gone and I have to redo.  
I suspect it is a competitor reporting me because I nudged out the top dog a few weeks after listing in this category. Also, there are a ton of sellers selling the same item as me with first class shipping and they are never removed (I don't report them because I think it's a stupid rule and quite frankly, I still sell more than them).  
The only difference this time is that while the majority of my live animal listings got pulled, a few remain.

Ebay,Buyer wants a refund,"So I started selling stuff on eBay. I sold a brand new Louis Vuitton mens wallet. It belonged to a family friend who I know for sure buys real stuff. It had the original paperwork and everything. The only thing that was damaged was the box because he had it stored under some other stuff. I uploaded like 10 photos including the box and I even put info about that in the description.

 Everything I sell I say no refunds allowed. This person opened a case claiming the wallet doesn't match the description or photos. They claim it started to crack 2 days after they got it. They uploaded photos and to me it looks like they sliced the corner of the wallet. It doesn't look like it was cracking. It arrived on June 28th. If it started cracking a couple days later why would they just now ask for a refund? They're claiming it's not authentic which is false. I sent this wallet in perfect condition. I have photos and even a video of me showing off the wallet and shipping label before I shipped it.

I’m not sure if he/she is trying to scam me, but with his/her high user rating, I would imagine they are likely not trying to scam me.

**Sale Details**

Item: ViewHD 2 Port 1x2 Powered HDMI Mini Splitter for 1080P &amp; 3D | Model: VHD-1X2MN3D

Sold For: $1

Shipping Paid: $9.92 (UPS Ground)

&amp;nbsp;

**Message Received From Buyer**

""I realize that your listing for this item stated ""no returns"", but I am contacting you to communicate how upset I am with this item. 

First, it does not work, in contrast to your listing description. I tried it with different cables, devices, etc. It did not work.

Second, not only does it not work, it killed a $100.00 Roku device! Yes, the device worked perfectly right before connecting this splitter, then dead after connection. 

I believe the problem is that you paired the wrong power adapter with this splitter, the enclosed one is 12V-1A, and the website calls for a 5V USB adapter. Visit at https://www.u9ltd.com/products/vhd-1x2mn3d . So, this device is probably ""fried"" from too much current.

This is my first truly bad experience on EBay in over 300 purchases. Perhaps it is ""shame on me"" for assuming the product actually did ""work well"", but the incorrect power adapter is downright dangerous.

I'm not sure what you wish to do about this issue, I have not left any feedback yet.""

&amp;nbsp;

**Thoughts**

I know that this device worked before I shipped it and was paired with the proper AC adaptor, because I tested the device before sending it.

Ebay,I won a dispute as a seller!,"This was my first case ever, first return request ever, and based on online forums and whatnot, definitely thought I was going to lose even though I believed I was 100% right. I pushed the case through more in principle than anything, because I truly believed the buyer was abusing the money back guarantee to return an item as I don't accept returns on my account. I just got off the phone with eBay and they're siding with me! 

So what happened: I sold a clothing item that had a zipper. The buyer messaged me after receiving it and claimed the zipper didn't work at all and wouldn't close. I knew this wasn't true because I checked it before I posted the package and the photos in my listing showed the zipper all the way up and closed. I tried to provide advice on how to zip it (not that it is difficult to do this) but the buyer wanted to return it. This was my first time so I wasn't sure what to do, I called eBay and they said basically my only option is to accept the return and refund it because it was a defective item. 

So I grudgingly accepted the return. Got the item back. Zip works. I called eBay and said I wanted to open a case, report the buyer for misuse of the money back guarantee and send them videos to show the zip worked. Did all that, in the meantime got negative feedback and not-that-nice messages from the buyer asking me to process the refund. I told them I was sending videos to eBay of the zipper working and was working with eBay to come to a resolution. The buyer messaged me again asking to process the return and also changed their story slightly saying the zipper worked when on a hanger but not when it was put on their body (to me this meant it didn't fit them...). 

I called eBay again to discuss the case and highlight what the buyer said in the most recent message plus made sure someone saw the videos I uploaded. The agent I got was super friendly, spoke English pretty well and said after reviewing it, they are siding in my favor! I am getting the negative feedback off my account and the funds are being released to me. I still have the item so I feel bad about that but I'm glad the case is settled. I'm sure the buyer is also getting their money back so unfortunately it's probably eBay eating the cost of this. 

Hope this provides some insight to others that sellers do sometimes win cases!

Tl;dr: don't accept returns on my account, buyer lied about defect on item to return it, I got the item back and sent photos and videos to eBay to prove it wasn't defective, they're siding with me and releasing my funds and wiping off the negative feedback from my account! Plus I still have the item...",12,38,2017-07-07,EBAY,0.14853137731552124,0.8266762495040894,0.024792423471808434

Ebay,Buyer unhappy with card condition,"I am quite new to selling on Ebay, and have been selling Pokemon cards. I listed the card with a front and back picture and said it was near mint condition. The buyer got the card and said they were happy with it except for a small crease in the corner. I did not notice this crease as the card has been in a top loader since I got it over ten years ago. As it is my fault for not noticing that I understand I should do something for the buyer.

My questions are:

* Should I offer a partial refund or have them return it?

* If I am offering a partial refund, how much seems reasonable? The card is in near perfect condition other than the small crease in the corner.

* How would I have them return it since I have a no return policy on the listing? I think it defaulted to this setting when I created the listing using their auto generated listing tool.",3,4,2017-07-09,EBAY,0.024079415947198868,0.9410556554794312,0.0348648726940155

Ebay,TIL Vacation mode is meaningless,"Like many sellers, I ended up subscribing to an eBay store.  Before we did it, we looked at a bunch of different ""What if?"" scenarios.  In all of them, we were right on the cusp between saving money with the discount vs paying the subscription fee.

What ultimately pushed us into a store was the ""vacation mode"" option.  It seemed like a nice feature to have when you have to travel for work, or the ever-elusive vacation.

After having to travel for work for two different weeks in May, I received an email from eBay last week stating that I was in jeopardy of losing my Top Rated Seller status, and by drilling down in the dashboard, it is because of orders that were placed during those two weeks.

It turns out that even if you put your store on vacation with a huge bright red banner at the top stating that orders placed would not ship until ""this date"", *eBay considers you out of compliance unless you also edit the handling time for each listing.*

Here's the kicker - if you change the handling time to greater than one day, you lose the discount for the store subscription for any orders placed with the modification.

You would think that eBay's software would be able to automatically calculate what the actual handling date would be, based on the end date of the vacation, and use THAT as your required ship date.  Alas, that is not the case.

So essentially, during times that you need to be away from your store, your options are to 1) leave your handling time at 1 day and risk losing your Top Seller status or 2) change your handling time and lose the discount you're paying for with your subscription.

The American eBay rep I spoke with stated that *even though* this has always been the case, and *even though* it's clearly listed in the support pages, eBay has heard from so many sellers about this issue that they are going to have a pop-up reminder whenever you turn on vacation mode, suggesting that you change your handling time.  

Since changing the handling time is an option that is available to non-store sellers, it looks like we need to go back and run those numbers again, before my automatic annual store renewal takes place.",19,29,2017-07-10,EBAY,0.046057265251874924,0.9175288081169128,0.03641389682888985
Ebay,Lack of negative feedback for buyers hurts sellers,"I have been recently running into more issues with Unpaid Buyers than I am use to. This is becoming a problem and something that I honestly am verging on finding and alternate route to sell items through. The common problem is that these are 0 feedback buyers and I have no way to stop them from placing bids or using Buy It Now to purchase the item.

In the eBay section of selling options I am given the ability to block people from having 2+ Unpaid Strikes in 6 months and those with -1 feedback or lower from bidding but it makes no difference. Without the ability to stop under 5 feedback score or lower, or leave negative feedback for a buyer there is no way to enforce the -1 feedback rule.

Why was this changed? It makes it much harder to be a small seller or an individual seller.",11,7,2017-07-10,EBAY,0.46233996748924255,0.5030379891395569,0.03462207689881325

Ebay,Buyer returning item he doesn't know how to use.,"So recently within the past week i sold a projector, it was a small portable projector that can hook up to tablets, phones and laptops either wirelessly or wired. in my description i included every little detail even on the realistic operation of the  item. The buyer receives the item and immediately within an hour i get a message complaining about how the set up and update isn't user friendly ( well what am i supposed to do about that?). He lets me know that it works great but it doesn't show certain apps, i informed him that airplay licensing cannot allow streaming of those apps so he'd have to connect it to his device.

That's where the SHTF and started going downhill, i informed him that if he is using an iphone he needs to buy an extension from the manufacturer which is pretty cheap he does so, few hours later starts asking why it does basic things like have a noise coming out of it (i reply that its the fan inside of it) then it continues for hours back and forth. we then fast forward to the last day of contact, i wake up to a message telling me the projector is malfunctioning because it dims when moved or has a low battery ( as most things would) i explain to him why it would do that and he then acknowledges that but then still claims the ""little projector is malfunctioning unfortunately hes going to put in a return request"". 

In this mans return request he included pictures of the same image one dimmed and one in normal lighting i approve it because i see the projector is not broken and would be fine to relist after inspection. essentially the buyer used my brand new item as a fun thing to try and learn for a few days Im not at all angry because i'll be able to sell it again but of course for cheaper now but what are some of your stories for buyers purchasing your items they know nothing about and have no idea how to use and refuse to look at the owners manual?",4,2,2017-07-10,EBAY,0.054931871592998505,0.9139518141746521,0.031116269528865814

Ebay,eBay's New 'Feature'...,"eBay are currently trialing a new feature whereby they bypass all kinds of sanity and pull a real Photobucket maneuver.

They've decided that it's a good idea to *hide* the detailed listing description and, instead, replace it with a few sentences randomly plucked from it. Then add a big ""see full listing description"" button underneath it.

If anyone else is seeing this, I recommend getting in contact with eBay and letting them know how terrible this is. eBay keep telling sellers that item descriptions need to be detailed with as much info as possible to make it easy for the customer to see what they've getting, then they decide to hide it all. On the eBay business seller forums there's a lot of hoohah from sellers who have invested a lot of money in custom templates, only to have it completely wiped. Also a huge increase in buyers starting return requests as they couldn't find all the info for an item, and also a decrease in sales for the same reason.

I only noticed it today because I was going through a load of listings and wondering why so many of them were completely sparce, and only had a sentence or two of random information.

Has anyone else encountered this 'feature' yet?",13,10,2017-07-13,EBAY,0.06487877666950226,0.9035162329673767,0.03160500153899193
Ebay,"Reported buyer for non-payment, he left me a negative feedback","I don't know the best way to handle this. A buyer won an auction for a used, but new looking baseball style hat. I listed it as used. I posted six photos of the hat to show its condition. The auction ended at $4.99. The buyer didn't pay. He sent a message saying he needed to cancel the auction because the hat is used. He made it sound as though I was trying to pass a used item as new. I checked the listing to make sure I didn't make a mistake and it was in fact listed as ""Used.""

Three days after the action ended, I went to the resolution center and reported it for non-payment. I just wanted to get the fees reversed so I could relist it. The buyer contacted me again, this time saying:
&gt; I need to cancel the order I have problems with my payment card, I want to cancel the transaction so as not to have eBay warning.

He seemed to be changing his story. First it was because the used hat was used, not it was because there was something wrong with his payment card. This was followed up with two more messages asking me to cancel it. 

Today I checked my feedback and noticed I just received a negative rating. It's from this same non-paying buyer. He wrote:

&gt; I did not realize that the product was used and I need to cancel

What's the best way to proceed? I didn't even know a non-paying buyer could leave you a feedback rating.

Ebay,"Getiing scammed, Help! Someone has used a graphics card for a month and is now trying to send it back, what do I do?","If you guys have heard of ethereum mining, this directly related to that.  I sold some cards on ebay, and one guy used it for mining for a month, and is now wanting to return it by claiming it is defective.

There is no chance this card arrived defective! It was bought for the sole purpose of mining, and was likely put to work within a few minutes after he got the package in his hand. If it didn't work, he would have issued a claim immediately.  There is about a 99.9999% chance he is trying to screw me over, because Ethereum just took a huge nose dive, and now mining isn't profitable for small operations.  

I sent him a message about not accepting returns, and gave him a link to gigabyte's rma site.

----------------------------------------------------

**edit:**  

This was my reply.

&gt;  I am sorry that you are experiencing issues, but this transaction transpired nearly one month ago, and I do not accept returns. The good news is that Gigabyte's Warranty service follows the items serial number, so you are still covered. Please contact Gigabyte, and initiate the RMA process. I will post the appropriate link below. http://www.gigabyte.us/Support/Warranty/Graphics-Card

----------------------------------------------------

**edit2:** :  I am trying to get him to admit he used and/or underclocked/overclocked the card. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**edit3:**  These are his replies to me.

&gt; You may not want to accept returns, but I do not accept defective products either. You sold me 2 identical cards, the one that has the problem consistently locks up the computer, I tried this in 3 different machines. The one that works fine works reliably on all those systems. Put in the good one, it runs just fine, swap for the bad one and it locks up within the hour. I think it's pretty sure the card is to blame. And please don't complain that it's almost been a month, of course it takes time to thoroughly test something instead of requesting a return at the first sign of trouble. I do not request returns lightly, I know they are a pain for the seller but in this case it's obvious the card has a problem and you should take it back and refund my money.

&gt; Don't you put words in my mouth, I NEVER ""admitted the card was in working order shortly after receiving it"", at any time. The bad card has always locked up the system on any PC I've tried it on, and that is exactly what I've been saying all along. By your own words that does make me eligible for a refund. And don't try to send me off to Gigabyte, if they would do anything at all they would only ever cover the normal MSRP for these cards, likely in the $200 range, not the inflated prices you and everyone is charging due to the GPU shortage. If you're going to take advantage and sell something for an inflated price, the least you can do is run with the money you make from selling items that DO work and not insist on also keeping money you made by selling a defective item. Paying regular price for a defective item would be bad enough, paying an inflated price for a defective item is even worse. Note also that I'm only asking to return 1 card, the other one works fine. But I can't just have you charge me $380 for something that doesn't work. I should be able to return it for a full refund since it's broken and has been from the moment I got it. If you won't, I'll just wait for eBay to step in.

--------------------------------------------
To me this clearly suggests that he used the cards for a month, and he is now saying he wants the money, and not the product.  Isn't this a clear violation?

--------------------------------------------------

**Edit4:**  At first he said he needed a month to ""test"" the card, which is utterly ridiculous at face value, and then in the second reply he states that

&gt; ""The bad card has always locked up the system on any PC I've tried it on.""

That's a complete contradiction to what he said earlier.  If the card **always** locked up his system, then he knew it was bad on the first day.  He wouldn't need 30 days to test it.",43,4,2017-07-13,EBAY,0.20625540614128113,0.7650861740112305,0.028658408671617508
Ebay,I shipped my $400 monitor back to the seller for a refund... no refund and no communication. Should I do a PayPal chargeback?,"Four weeks ago: 

I bought a $400 computer monitor from a relatively large tech seller who sells dozens of tech items on ebay. When it arrived, it was faulty. I messaged the seller and he helped me troubleshoot the issue and he determined that it was faulty. I started an ebay moneyback guarantee claim and asked the seller for a refund. He said that he is willing to give me a refund, minus shipping, if I just handle it privately with him instead of going through the ebay money back guarantee system. I agreed and cancelled the official request. He told me to ship the monitor back to him (from Utah to California).

One week later:

I haven't heard from the seller, even though the shipping only took three days. I message him and ask about my refund. He says he received my monitor and asked if I wanted him to send me a replacement (?). I said I wanted the original refund that we agreed upon and he said ""sounds good.""

Two weeks after that (today):

No refund, no new communication. I message him and asked him what the status of me refund is three days ago and he didn't respond. I messaged him again yesterday and (gently) threatened a Paypal chargeback if I don't hear from him. He hasn't responded, which is weird because he used to always respond on the same day.

Should I...

A: proceed with a Paypal chargeback

B: open an ebay moneyback guarantee claim

or C: wait longer

Do these types of refunds generally take this long? Should I just chill? Or am I correct in being a little bit peeved here?

**EDIT: Thank you for the advice. I filed for a paypal chargeback, including the evidence that he had told me to close the refund request, and paypal accepted my claim. Once the chargeback hit, the seller responded immediately, after over a week of silence, claiming that he wasn't replying because he had been on vacation. I got my money back through paypal, and all is well.**",12,4,2017-07-13,EBAY,0.08283400535583496,0.8861685395240784,0.030997425317764282

I have been trying to track package and it is still in New Jersey or Jersey City. This has been the worst tracking ever. It is suppose to be here in 2 days. I am very disappointed. To pay that much for shipping, I have always had everything arrive at the earliest date not the latest date. I will let you know if it does not arrive. It was a birthday present.

I'm very sorry you're having trouble. I just checked and the item sale ended on the 2nd and I had it sent out on the 3rd. Any problems shipping are the fault of the USPS. As you stated, the delivery is not late yet. If the expected delivery date passes with no update to the tracking information I would definitely contact them and complain.

Ebay,Dad (UK) having trouble with eBay (Italy). He cannot talk to people in Italy due to language barriers and UK ebay refute to deal with it. How to proceed?,"Edit- title is suppose to say 'refuse' 

Hi all, 

My dad (UK) sold a model boat on ebay to a man in Italy. The payment was received to my dad's PayPal and the item went through the shipping company who repackage it, and it arrived in Italy. 

The man in Italy said the item is damaged. So ebay went ahead and removed the money from my dad's PayPal to refund the buyer. 

My dad spoke to the shipping company who check all items, and they said the boat was fine when they saw it. Which means that it was after it left the shipping company that it got damaged.

My dad either wants his money back or the boat back. This man hasn't even sent a picture of the damage! At the moment, the man has his money and the boat and my dad has neither! 

He has phoned ebay UK 7 times who say it's ebay Italy 's problem, but due to the language barrier he can't get anything out of ebay Italy.

My dad is 75 and not good with computers, so I really want to be able to help him. I'm happy to phone whoever and be persistent, can I raise this even higher anyhow? It all seems a bit of a shit show and I'm angry on his behalf. The item was sold for £100.

Ebay,My latest refund attempt...,"Just starting off by saying that if something arrives damaged, I'm more than happy to refund. Fortunately, it's not happened often, as I take care to pack my items well.

Earlier this month, I sold a makeup brush. I get a message this morning letting me know that it arrived broken (brush head came off handle). For those who don't know, these types of brushes are typically a handle, with a metal part holding the bristles connected to it. If this comes detached, it's usually as simple as popping it back on, and if you absolutely need to, a bit of glue will hold it in place. But whatever--if I received something new, and it arrived like that, I'd probably want to return to. 

As standard procedure, I apologize for it arriving broken. I then ask for photos showing the broken item and the packaging before I process a return. This is what I got in return: [Photo of ""damaged"" item](http://imgur.com/Ae9WCDO). Head. Desk.

I responded basically blaming ebay for the blatant issue with the photo (even though I'm beyond convinced this buyer is a liar after seeing that). I requested a full image of the item. I then also said I need the packaging for my insurance claim, which USPS would need to investigate (yeah, at that point I'm just throwing in BS--it was sent First Class, but one can always hope).

They just replied with [this picture](http://imgur.com/a/y1b4U) showing a fully complete, put together brush. Also a picture of the padded envelope shipped in. I haven't responded to this latest...yet. I'm just not sure how to proceed. No case yet, just messages/refund request.

So... Any thoughts? Suggestions?

Edit/update 1:

In the past hour, I have received two additional messages. One stating that they provided pics and to refund (where we were at the end). The second says that she received a refund of $6.25, but paid $X for the item. I have not refunded a dime as of yet (also verified in paypal), so I assume she's trying to scam multiple sellers, and got her wires crossed.",9,10,2017-07-17,EBAY,0.047624122351408005,0.9147505164146423,0.03762537240982056
Ebay,Any recourse for a seller cancelling orders and relisting?,"I'm going to start by saying that I don't have an eBay account and have never been a heavy user of the site. I've probably made 5-10 orders of under $20 each in total, and each time I clicked on ""Buy Now"" and completed the transaction as a guest through my PayPal with no issues.

I need a new phone and after staking out the buy now listings for a new days, I found a listing that I thought was fair and bought it through Buy Now last night, again using my PayPal as payment, which deducted the money from my credit card. I woke up today to find that the seller had cancelled the order as an invalid address (I live in Florida.) 

I checked the listings to see if the item was still available, which it was, so I completed the order again (which involved paying again, as the initial payment hasn't even cleared my card, much less been refunded) and created an account so I could send a message alongside the order confirming the address that I put in and that it was a valid U.S. address. The seller cancelled the order again a while later claiming that the cancellation was at the buyer's request, which is blatantly untrue. So now I'm out well over $1000 dollars for probably the next week until the refunds go through, and even then I assume the money will be left in my PayPal rather than refunded to my credit card. Is there anything I can do about a seller basically refusing to sell an item they list, despite receiving full payment instantly, just because?

Ebay,Actually got a negative feedback removed!,"Customer left a negative feedback for me yesterday stating, ""$12.50 shipping! Ripoff... poor customer service.""

I didn't think this one would get removed since it had a generic, opinion based comment in regards to the customer service, but I figured I'd give it a try.

Our normal shipping is $6.25 (the exact cost of USPS small flat rate for us) and she bought 2 items. The listing explicitly states that in order to receive combined shipping message us and wait for a combined invoice.

While the customer did message us, she did it over the weekend. The listing states our hours and days of business. She didn't wait after sending a message for the combined invoice and made payment during the weekend while we were closed. Once she's paid, it's too late for us to do anything. If you want to pay the shipping twice because you're impatient, that's on you.

However, we did respond to her message Monday morning before we were technically open to let her know we'd received payment and the items would be going out.

Ultimately I think the eBay rep removed the feedback because the shipping charges are clearly stated in the listing as is all the policies in regards to combined shipping. Which she promptly ignored. Furthermore, every message of hers was responded to appropriately within minutes of them being received.

But what I think *really* helped my case, was that 90% of the feedback she left was negative, usually bitching about shipping costs she'd agreed to and couldn't haggle down.

Yes. She's blocked.

Ebay,"eBay email ""Warning - Offers to sell outside of eBay""!","I received this email a few hours ago, claiming I ""may not be following an important eBay policy"".  It used a recent listing as an ""example"". I had nothing in the listing with contact info, not had I corresponded with anyone regarding selling outside of eBay.

So I called eBay. Spoke to a nice person who said that someone had messaged me with their phone number regarding the item yesterday. I checked my eBay messages and my email program and could find nothing at all regarding this. When pressed, she said the message wasn't actually delivered to me because of a ""silent block"" (whatever that is). 

So, let me reiterate. eBay sent me a warning to not take the sale outside of eBay based upon an email that another member had sent me and eBay had blocked, meaning I never received the message?

I was stunned and bit outraged. I escalated to a supervisor (had to pend about another 15 minutes on hold) and the supervisor said exactly the same thing, I had received a warning because another member had sent an email to me with contact info in it. He also confirmed that the message was blocked and I never received it.

He indicated that nothing would come of it and I shouldn't worry about it. I responded that I was definitely worried about and I needed to have something from him in writing that this email was sent in error and would not affect my account, now or in the future. To my surprise, he agreed and sent an email stating exactly that.

Ebay,Buyer claims defective product 2 months after purchase. I accept return and it works perfectly. Can I deny the refund or give a partial refund?,"Back in May I sold a copy of Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo. I am a new seller, starting to become more serious, so I messaged him asking him if he found the product as described if he would leave positive feedback. He tells me that the game he bought is not allowing him to save. He plays for a long time, and when he plays next time he starts over. 

So I do some research and it looks like it is this problem that happens with old nintendo cartridges where the little battery that stores saved games has died. So I explain this to the buyer and I offer to buy him a new battery, so he can install it himself, or I offer him a refund. He elects to refund. I get the game back yesterday and it works perfectly. It does not have the problem he claimed it did. Then he changes his story slightly when I reach back out to him, saying when he takes the game out of the console it erases his games. This is also not hapenning for me. 

I think back on it like there was a possibility that he bought the game, played it for two months and then decided to take advantage of someone looking for good feedback to get a refund. In addition to the cost, I'm on the hook for the original shipping and the return shipping. All in all, I will probably lose like $10 and an hour or two cumulative during this process. I don't think after the bitching this guy gave me he really deserves a refund on an item that works perfectly. Is there a way to dispute the refund, or give a partial refund to the guy?

Here is a bonus question you guys may school me on: Should I not have accepted a return after 2 months?

Thanks, alot!",11,6,2017-07-21,EBAY,0.08600921183824539,0.8769387006759644,0.03705206513404846
Ebay,US Buyer Claims Item is Counterfiet - Wants to Return to Canadian Seller - Options?,"I (seller) am located in Canada and I sold a brand new hat (Diesel brand name) to a buyer in the US.

The buyer has opened a ""request for return"" stating that they THINK (exactly what they said they THINK) the item is counterfeit.

The hat originally costed about $30 CDN, and it was sold for about $20 USD total including shipping. The hat selling price itself is about $11.99 USD.

I shipped it on the same day the buyer used buy it now and they received it within a week as per tracking #. 2 weeks after receiving they now filed this request that it is counterfeit.

Their story is that they bought it as a gift, they gave it to someone, and that person said its a fake and does not want it.

I had 10 clear pictures of the hat including 3 showing clearly all the tags on the hat. So the item was new, with all tags attached exactly as shown. The buyer has confirmed that the item arrived exactly as pictured, with all the tags attached as shown in my ebay listing.

But they are saying they FEEL its not authentic (again their wording).

This item was bought a very long time ago, and I just happened to find it in the back of my closet. I am not an ebay power seller, just another guy selling stuff here and there from his closet.

I have actually located the original receipt, in the same place I found the hat.

I have already told the buyer that I want to try and work it out with them, but I am open to a return if it comes to it (even though I said no returns).

I sent them photos of the receipt to show authenticity. 

As they started a ""request for return"" I have 3 days to work it out with them (today is the last day), then eBay may step in then.

Now I need some advice

1) I have clear photos of the item, and the original tags and UPC codes on the item all in my listing. The buyer has agreed that all the tags are on it, as pictured. I now found and have a receipt for the item as well. I showed my buyer this already. The receipt has the description of the item AND matching UPC code #, same as on the item tags.

If the buyer filed a ""item is counterfiet"" what are the chances of me, the seller, being able to win, if this escalates into a full case? 

Im not sure what else I can do to show its real besides having the receipt and all the tags as shown and pictured. 

2) I am pretty sure this case is ""buyers remorse"". I have shown them quite positive proof the item is real. And on top of this I have told them that I do apologize for the hassle. So I am willing to give a partial refund on the hat to save them the hassle of having to go ship it and needing to wait for me to get it back and verify it. So Im giving you a better deal on this authentic item and saving you hassle.

The buyer still insists that they want to return the item, and wants me to provide a shipping label. 

I told them that since I am in Canada I can not provide a USPS shipping label, BUT once I receive the item and confirmed that it is in its original condition I can give a full refund including shipping.

So unfortunately they will need to prepay for the return shipping to me. 

No reply yet, but I am debating escalating this case to eBay myself.

I have already given this buyer every single option outside of just giving a full refund and letting them keep the hat.

I seriously think this is buyers remorse, if they wanted a deal they would have taken my partial refund. If they were really concerned it was not authentic, well I showed them the receipt. 

They said exactly ""Sorry, we do not want the hat. My husband says its fake. Please give us a shipping label. We overall want a full refund""

For them to insist that I provide a shipping label says to me that they just want a freebie return to get their full refund. Which is why they are making this big story the hat is a fake.

Should I escalate this to eBay myself? 

I dont know what else I can tell this person.

-----------------------------UPDATE----------------------------------------------

Everyone I just want to firstly say thank you so much for all of your replies.

All of your feedback, opinons and advice was greatly appreciated as I was in the hot seat for the past 3 days.

As some have mentioned, I tried nearly everything to work it out with this buyer.

I was able to find a receipt and I showed it to them proving the item is authentic. They continued to say they just want a full refund.

The receipt CLEARLY showed the UPC barcode #, and item description. Also in my listing photos the tags on the item CLEARLY matched the UPC on the receipt. I think this really helped my case.

So despite giving positive proof they did not accept the fact that this was purchased at a large department store and I had clear evidence this item was authentic.

But to give them the benefit of the doubt, and for all their hassle I told them I was willing to give them a partial refund. So rest assured, they get an authentic hat at an even better deal.

They also declined this, and basically kept on telling me to provide a shipping label to return the item as they want a full refund.

I continued to explain to them that unfortunately I was not able to provide a shipping label to them through eBay since I am in Canada and he is in US. 

I told him, even after presenting him with evidence and another option for a partial refund, if he absolutely insists on returning the item I will accept it so long as it is in its original condition, but unfortunately since this was an international sale he would need to prepay the return shipping and I can reimburse him in full once I received and confirmed the items condition.

I was instructed by eBay to NOT send any money or a refund until AFTER receiving the item.

I told him that a partial refund would save him time, and the need to prepay for return shipping.

He flatly replied said he wants a shipping label and a full refund.

As someone has mentioned, I really think this is buyers remorse and they just wanted to get free return shipping and a full refund.

I was exacerbated at this point as I tried every option outside of sending him cash to send it back.

So I rolled the dice, I called in and told eBay to escalate this to a dispute.

And I WON THE CASE!

I was stressing over this the past few days as I was worried about a seller defect, as well as negative feedback. But since I won the case, I am safe from both!

So my eBay account integrity is safe.

But the buyer actually went and created a Paypal case now. 

Im going to try to keep things short regarding the Paypal case but generally the details are as follows.

I spoke to Paypal and since eBay and Paypal are two seperate entities now, this is why the buyer was able to open a case in eBay, and even though I won they opened a case in Paypal.

Paypal instructed me to take screen shots of all my communications with this buyer which I did. 

In the paypal dispute, I uploaded all the photos of the original item, store receipt, shipping receipt to show I shipped same day, and quite a few screen shots of all the communication between me and this buyer via ebay messages.

I called back into Paypal to confirm receipt of all my documentation and to see if there was anything else required. The rep at Paypal confirmed receipt, and was sympathetic to my case as I told them I already won the eBay case, and now this buyer is coming after me in Paypal and I dont know when this will all end over $20.

The rep then put me on hold for several minutes and then came back to inform me that from all the evidence I submitted, as well as the eBay ruling and to help avoid a charge back if the buyer decides to go to their credit card company that they would actually close this case ""amicabbly"" - Meaning that the buyer keeps the hat, and gets a refund of their money. And I get to keep my money as well and my integrity is intact.

This all just happened, and I am at work right now. So I will check my emails later to see if what the rep said is actually true, which I dont see why it wouldnt.

But I just wanted to let others know this is what happened. There are many factors in any case, maybe I got lucky that this was such a small item that both eBay and Paypal said forget it, I really dont know.

I know that there are some out there that advised me to just bite the bullet and give a full refund. For this particular transaction, it was not about the money as it was a small sum, but a matter of principle. I had proof positive of a receipt matching the item, and the buyer insisted on returning it with no further information or evidence the item was fake aside from them saying they THINK (thats their word) its fake. I also tried to work with them providing all sorts of options including taking the return, but they would have to prepay and I reimburse after receipt and they refused all of them.

I really did not want to let this scammer go, as I felt also that it was someone questioning my integrity.

I was willing to risk negative feedback as I really did not want this scammer to win.

And thankfully, I won and I will be reporting this buyer shortly.

I hope this will help someone out there, and my faith in both eBay and Paypal has been restored.",7,3,2017-07-21,EBAY,0.056219013407826424,0.9104577302932739,0.0333232618868351

Last week I purchased an item (a large toy/figure) and the only shipping option available in the listing was USPS Priority Mail, costing $35.65. I figured this would be the cost for Priority Mail since the item was large. 

The next business day, the seller sent the item and when I looked up the tracking, it was for USPS Retail Ground service. Kind of annoying, since I thought I would be getting my item quickly and was charged so much for the shipping. I decided to wait until the item arrived and see how much the postage actually costed them. 

The package finally came today and the postage sticker says $11.86, which is a lot less than what I paid for shipping, and they sent it with a slower mail class than advertised.

Am I justified in sending them a message asking for a refund for the difference? Does ebay frown on that? If it was only a few dollars I wouldn't care, but they sent it by a slower mail class for $23.79 cheaper than what I paid.",18,4,2017-07-22,EBAY,0.034466203302145004,0.9143363237380981,0.05119749903678894

Ebay,"New to eBay here, is it normal for tracking to just randomly stop?","So I ordered a couple things from Korea off eBay and for some reason the tracking has stopped. On my one order of three items the last update was on July 20th saying ""Ready for dispatch. Korea Post EMS
INTERNATIONAL POST OFFICE"".

Then on two individual orders one last updated July 20th says: Delivered to Transport companies Korea Post EMS INCHEON and the other last updated July 17th says: Ready for dispatch Korea Post EMS INTERNATIONAL POST OFFICE. 

Is it normal for tracking to suddenly stop like this? What I'm maybe thinking is that my item is or has already come to Canada and it's just waiting to be picked up by Canada Post to update the tracking and since it's the weekend it probably won't update until Monday right? I'm not sure if this is normal or not since the last time I bought an item from Korea I used express since it was available and it was updated immediately. 

Another thing I'm thinking is that maybe they noticed my name on three different packages since I did order them a day apart,  and just decided to put them all in one big box and use one shipping tracker. I know I didn't get scammed since I bought from a Top Rated Seller. Is this normal for regular shipping internationally?

Ebay,"Seller listed a false item location, how should I go about this?","I don't purchase from independent sellers often (or on Ebay generally) but jumped on a BD collection at a good price. The item's location was listed as being within the US, but I was informed that the item was shipping from Hong Kong through the tracking number. The shipping was free but returns aren't. I also wouldn't have bought this item if I'd known it was coming out of China because that leads me to believe this is a fake.

Maybe I'm jumping the gun here and the seller is sending me the genuine item, but I feel like it puts me in an awkward situation of being less sure if what I'm buying is legit or not, which I shouldn't have been in the first place. That's not to say someone in the US couldn't have sold me a fake either, but I think there are different circumstances involved when this item is an Amazon retail exclusive and someone from China is selling several of them.

I sent the seller a message a day ago being blunt. I explained how the listing location was incorrect, how it made me question the legitimacy of the item and asked how returns would be handled since international and domestic shipping will differ.

So, any advice? I had planned to not respond to the last seller message and escalate to eBay as soon as possible as the seller has to do something with the return request - they can't just ignore it and tell me to file with USPS, right? I know I wouldn't.

Another weird thing was that his paypal didn't accept the money instantly and he had to go accept it himself.

Ebay,Explain how ebay counts shipping times please.,"This is the one area on my ebay seller statistics that is lacking. Would like to better understand how ebay tracks these number if possible.


Is it based on if the seller says item was received in the time frame you said it would when creating the listing? 

Is it based on having tracking uploaded within your shipment handling time frame? Typically on these I 'mark the as shipped' as soon as they are bought and then later when it's ready to be returned to the customer send them tracking. Does it even matter to mark item as shipped that soon so presumably ebay wont penalize my performance?

&gt;The batteries on this are dead and the cartridge does not work.. is there something you are willing to do?? It's non working product.. please contact me back asap

I send back:

&gt;I am very sorry to hear that. When I created the listing I made sure to point out the expiration date of 19 years ago in the title so that all bidders would be fully informed when making their decision to purchase.

She says:

&gt;""I didn't see the expiration date when I purchased I just seen it was the type I was looking for and bought it thinking that it would work.. its a present for my daughter.. so there's nothing that you are willing to do?? Being you sold me a product that doesn't work??

...and then opens a Return request saying

&gt;""The item I ordered does not work and I have tried to contact the seller to see if they would like to do something and they didn t answer and I feel they should return it beings they sold a defective item""

Obviously the ""seller didn't answer"" line is a lie because she responded to my response, and she outright admits she didn't read the listing properly. When I go to the Return page on ebay, the only option that does not involve me giving her any money or a new product back is to send her a message, there doesn't seem to be a way to dispute the buyer's reasoning.

Ebay,Buyer didn't want $275 tablet so dropped it and returned it as not working....,"Sold a Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2"" in mint condition.  Before the item was delivered to the buyer, she asked if it had 4G/LTE (it didn't and was not advertised as having it).  I had a bad feeling at that point she would be pulling something.  

Of course, the item gets delivered and that afternoon she sends a message claiming the tablet doesn't turn on and that I better quickly let her return it.  Having no real choice, I accept the return.  Received the tablet today and it's obviously been dropped (one corner is badly scraped up, was not like that when I shipped it in the original box).  The screen also wouldn't work.  Googled the problem and found that it's common for the display connector to pop off on these when dropped.  Was able to open it up and pop the connector back on so all is good there, just can't fix the physical damage she caused.  

If she didn't want it then why not just list it and sell it herself?  Why do people have to be so horrible?",37,24,2017-07-26,EBAY,0.8417338132858276,0.1424538940191269,0.015812255442142487

Ebay,"Ended auction is listed as ""Payment is being processed through PayPal"" with an hourglass - no payment received","Yesterday an auction of mine was completed, but I had no immediate payment from the buyer. Today, the auction page header reads: ""Payment was initiated on Jul 24, 2017 and is being processed through PayPal | View PayPal transaction,"" and my dashboard shows an hourglass icon in the ""paid or not"" column.

Ebay,eBay wants me to wait until time runs out on return. Is this bad advice?,"I had a buyer open a return on an item saying it was broken. The listing is for a $20 ipod sold for parts (it goes for $100 working so that should have been the buyer's first tip that this wasn't working). ""For parts"" is in the title, the condition and in the description, as well as an explanation as to what for parts means and what they are receiving. 

Even with all of the precautions, the buyer sent me an angry message when he received it, and opened an Item received damaged case. After some rude messages from him and some back and forth, I offered him to send it back to, he pays for shipping. I offered him a full refund, but I wasn't going to lose money for his buyer's remorse/refusal to even read the title of what he was buying. 

He responded with:

&gt;HA I know how eBay works, You're screwed. You sell me a broken product and I'm getting my money back and not paying a dime for shipping. Nice try!

So I called eBay, and the first lady I spoke with said: 

&gt;""Yeah this is definitely buyers remorse, and it's good you offered him a return anyway. Just let the case run out and you'll win.""

I felt semi-satisfied with that answer until yesterday when the buyer sent me another message saying: 

&gt;""When are you accepting my return? If time runs out I'm escalating this to eBay! You have to accept my return!""

So I was worried and called again. Again a different person reassured me that I just let the time run out (which is now later today) and the case will close in my favor. 

I feel like this is bad advice. In the past when I've called they just closed the case for me. If it runs out, can't I get a defect and then still have to return it? Or does it just escalate the case so someone on eBay can look at the evidence and close it?

Ebay,Buyer charge backs his credit card stating unauthorized purchase,"I sold a motherboard the 2nd of this month, purchased USPS shipping through eBay,  without signature confirmation, and it was delivered on the 7th to his verified shipping and billing address on PayPal. 

Two days ago I received an email stating the funds had been put on hold. I read a few threads on here saying they called PayPal and they released the funds right away after seeing shipping information was provided. Unfortunately, my operator just stated that it was all in the hands of the credit card company. Do I have some sort of protection towards that, or is it only for unauthorized purchases issued through PayPal/eBay? She stated that it'd take up to 75-80 days and if they decide against me I have to file a claim outside of PayPal, and that I'd basically be screwed.  

The buyer has not contacted me at all. Simply he purchased my motherboard, made no contact with me, went straight to his CC, and claimed he did not make the purchase.

If you've ever had experience on this issue, how long did it take to resolve and on whose favor?

I would like to add though that I had to call in twice, the first time I received a somewhat, unknowledgeable operator that basically skimmed over the whole sellers protection and verified paypal address case and simply stated that I would have to wait 75-80 days and its all in the hands of the credit card company.

Ebay,What's the deal with this GTX 1080 for $49? (and other 1070's for the same price?),"The obvious answer is that it's a scam.  But I'm not satisfied with such a simple answer, as that answer only gives me more questions and I'm hoping someone can shed some more light on this.  I've recently seen several 1070's on ebay that have successfully sold for $50 and a 1080 today for $50 (well $49) that was still listed.  Seller has no feedback whatsoever, and it's obviously a scam but I almost bought it just because I know ebay will return my money to me when it turns out to be a scam.  I mean...they would have to.  But that leads me to the question...why do these people even do this?  I was on the other side of a chargeback once with Paypal and eBay and instead of the banks footing the bill, paypal demanded I pay the money back.  So the seller will have to return the money.  And even if they don't, and they manage to get away with $5,000 or $10,000 before their paypal account is shut down and they are sent to collections, they can't possibly keep that up.  That is a situation where it seems to me that if you continue to do it, something is going to give.

So is there more to this than I'm understanding?  I just dont' see why people would even bother doing this scam if the victim will just get their money back anyway.

After several calls to PayPal, they were finally able to cancel the transaction. I was charged a $20 final value fee, I called ebay they are not able to do anything about it because it has been more than 30 days.

Ebay,eBay no longer changing status to shipped and adding tracking number.,"As of 3 days ago, eBay has ceased to change order statuses to 'shipped' and add tracking numbers to orders when I purchase shipping labels. In addition, I am no longer receiving the usual 'you created a shipping label' notifications. I didn't even notice until someone contacted me asking when the item would be shipped. I've been printing out the labels as I always have, so I'm unsure what may have changed. I usually print labels via the app, so I can't say if the same issue happens when using the standard site.

Ebay,Seller refusing full refund for defective items,"I don't frequent eBay too much; sold a few things, bought a few things here and there. Haven't had to deal with returning anything so I'm not sure what the norm is.

I'm trying to return them for a refund, but the seller wants to settle with a partial refund. He won't budge on this, and messaged me that it's standard practice to not receive full refunds. 


Is this normal, or if I keep refusing the partials will ebay eventually step in? As I mentioned before, I don't shop on ebay much so maybe I'm unaware of the standard practices, just looking for some insight! Should I take what I can get, or will ebay help out?

Ebay,Question re: eBay-intervening Returns,"Hi everyone,

I am not the biggest eBayer ever (feedback score of about 30, had it for many years) but unfortunately for me this week I ran into my first big problem. I bought something golf related, so for those of us who aren't golfers, I will try and explain as best I can.

The listing was titled ""Project X HZRUS Black .335 Hybrid Shaft""....Project X HZRDUS Black is simply the brand and model of the shaft to go on a golf club, that I don't dispute. "".335"" is the measurement of the diameter at the part of the shaft that goes in the golf club. While the clubs I had I knew had .370 openings, I have many spare clubs, and figured if I could put this on one of them and sell it as a completed item I could make a nice profit, or even use it. 

Now, here's where the problem is. Upon receiving it, I realize it is not a Hybrid shaft as listed in the title. A hybrid is a type of club. It is a shaft for a fairway wood, a different type of club. The parts to these clubs, if you could even fit the shaft in (heh) in the other club, are not interchangeable. You'd notice a performance difference.

I tried to ask for a return after telling him that not only my golf club repairmen, but even the company who made the shaft said this is not a shaft for hybrid clubs.

Seller said no, it is a shaft that is .335 in diameter as listed, you knew what you were getting. In messages, he even eventually admitted he used it in a fairway wood, a different style of club. He said we will let eBay decide.

So, now I have this club component that is not at all what I wanted, regardless of diameter size, and I am waiting for eBay to decide.

Are my chances of getting a refund good? It was pretty expensive. How does this even work? Would eBay either say no, you have to keep it, or force him to give me a refund and send it back?

Thank you for any help more experienced eBayers can provide.

-----------------

TL;DR: I purchased a golf club shaft on eBay, and while everything else in the description was accurate, a very important part was not. I asked for a refund and the seller said no and he'd let eBay decide. Are my chances good?",12,2,2017-07-29,EBAY,0.02259877137839794,0.9085994362831116,0.06880179047584534

Ebay,11 Things I've Learned During 1 Month of eBay Selling,"1) **Payment Error on Mobile**: Buyers may see a ""cannot deliver to your address"" error if they attempted to pay your invoice through the eBay mobile app or mobile site on a phone, tablet, etc. They should try paying the invoice through a desktop/laptop instead.

2) **Invoice Corrections**: You can issue a new invoice if a buyer hasn't paid yet, and it will overwrite the previous invoice. Handy for any corrections you have to make.

3) **USPS Priority Mail with Registered Mail**: This mail type ensures items are mailed in secured lock boxes and insured up to $50,000. It's also a slower form of mail due to the high security and unbroken chain of custody. Custody records are saved by USPS, but not provided unless an insurance claim is opened.

4) **INR (Item Not Received)**: If a buyer opens an INR, immediately add the tracking number to the open claim.

5) **Escalated INR**: Don't wait for a buyer escalate an INR because you run the risk of eBay closing the case in the buyer's favor, forcing a refund, and giving you a bad seller rating. PayPal will withhold the funds from your account, even if it puts your account in the negative.

6) **Closing an INR in Seller's Favor**: Don't wait for the buyer to escalate an INR case. Call eBay after tracking info is provided, and the item shows as delivery attempted or delivered. Ask if the case can be closed in your favor.

7) **Ratings and Feedback**: The moment you message a buyer, you unlock their ability to rate their responsiveness if they leave feedback.

8) **Buyer PMs with More Issues**: Don't commit to anything without proof of the issue/damage and/or a returned item in your hands. Put on your best smiling customer service face and reply through eBay Messages:

* Offer your apologies that their Registered Mail item was damaged in transit.
* Remind them of your No Returns policy from the original listing (if applicable).
* Request that they send photos of the damaged item and damaged packaging to eBay.

9) **Claim Limit for 1 Item**: A buyer should only be able to open 1 claim per item. If a buyer attempts to open another claim on the same item, all eBay directly to have it closed.

10) **Claim Timeframe**: After an item is delivered, a buyer has the timeframe below to file a claim:

* Up to 30 days through eBay
* Up to 180 days through PayPal

11) **Problem Buyer Doesn't Leave Feedback**: If the buyer doesn't leave feedback, they probably don't want you to reply publicly with how you have attempted to resolve their issues at every turn per eBay Seller Policy.

**TL;DR**: As a fresh-faced eBay seller, I was excited to tell an expensive comic book  and other less expensive bits from my collection on eBay. Then, I learned a ton of handy eBay seller facts when a buyer filed an INR claim on the expensive comic book. He later picked the item up and PMed me the day after delivery to claim the item (which was sent Registered Mail in a lock box) was damaged in transit.

Ebay,Leaving Negative Feedback - Am I being unreasonable? Package arrived a month late (according to delivery estimate) but within reasonable time for a package from HK.,"I recently (2 months ago) ordered an electrical item ($25 camera module) from HongKong. 

I chose that particualr seller over many others based on it's 1-2 weeks estimated delivery time, whereas all other sellers had 6-8 weeks estimated delivery. I figured they'd use airmail or something faster than the usual shipping-container route. 

It arrived last week - a month after the estimated delivery time. 

As a result, (and because I had to source the item from germany instead to hit the deadline), I left negative feedback, saying that I suspected the shipping times were artificially short to justify the slightly higher price. 

This seller has sold 75 items in the last year, and has now mailed me 4 times in total to ask me to change my feedback to positive. According to the seller, the ""boss"" of this huge outfit with a yearly turnover of $2000 is angry, and will fire the seller. Sure. 

Every item they have for sale lists approx 1-2 weeks delivery, and is slightly more expensive than the competition. So far I'm sticking to my guns....   I feel slightly conned, and feel as though they're deliberately attempting to con others with an implausible delivery date. 

In the grand scheme of things This doesn't matter in the slightest...  but after receiving 4 begging emails in four days, I'm wondering if I'm out of line. 


Additionally, the connection cable for this camera module was incorrectly wired, and only thanks to a well set-up power supply with adjustable overload protection did I not fry the damned thing. **EDIT for clarity:** *Both the camera and the power lead for it were the thing that I purchased. It would have fried itself. Through over-caution and experience I manged to avoid that and have since rectified the problem. I advised the seller to check the wiring on all other units that they have in stock.* 

This is the first time I've ever left negative feedback in over 300 purchases. I figured it might save others from similar minor annoyance. 

They've offered a full refund if I change my feedback to positive...  but I don't want to get something for free or be dishonest - which would be the result of changing my feedback.
