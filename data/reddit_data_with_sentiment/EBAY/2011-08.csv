Ebay,"Item listed as ""Free Shipping"" then seller asks me to pay shipping.","I bought a Korg keyboard from an international seller located in Belgium for $630 American Dollars. The item's shipping was listed as free so I thought it was a good deal. After paying almost instantly after winning through PayPal, the seller messaged me and asked for my shipping address so he/she could calculate shipping and send me an invoice to pay for it. 

I was confused and reread the description of the item and I noticed this written at the bottom: 

""500 EURO + shipment (from Ghent, Belgium) or pick up shipment prices on demand"" 

So I emailed the seller telling him/her that while I acknowledged that the description mentioned there would be shipping to pay, the item's original listing said free. He/she said ""That's a mistake made by Ebay."" 

So, I'm wondering what's the deal here. I've only bought a few items off eBay and never anything internationally so I'm not sure what's going on. 

Is it allowed for the seller to advertise the item's shipping as free but revoke that in the description? I know that I should have been more careful when reading the description but I still feel like this is not right somehow.

**Edit: Thanks guys for helping me resolve this issue. I contacted the seller and he was pretty adamant about me paying the shipping. So I refused and asked for my money back. He returned it and everything is ok. We were both cordial in our correspondance which I believe helped resolve the issue smoothly. Now the next question is, do I give him negative feedback?**",6,4,2011-08-01,EBAY,0.05748053640127182,0.9110077023506165,0.0315118245780468

Ebay,"Item was listed ""as is"", but the seller under-exaggerated the damage. Am I in the right to dispute this?","Here is the description: 

&gt;Selling used Canon 85mm F1/8 Lens.
It was tested by manual focus camera , not guarantee for Auto Focusing Camera. Working charm with MF.
Also no distance cover window.
Selling AS-IS.

I asked the seller the following question: 

&gt;What is the condition of this? Are the optics scratched at all? Is the exterior scratched? Is there any way you could test this to make sure the auto focus works?

And the reply:

&gt;It's normal condition. Optics not scratched but exterior not as good as new one. Unfortunately I couldn't check AF system. Thank you.

I won the auction and received the lens yesterday. The lens appears to have been dropped, the focus ring is sticky, and the distance numbers don't line up with the movement of the focus ring. If I had known that I wouldn't have bought the lens and would have known that the auto focus wouldn't work in that condition.

Ebay,"Scammed, I am an idiot but helpful suggestions please","Okay, details:
Upgraded my phone but didn't want the upgrade so thought to sell on eBay. I have never sold on eBay before so I was a bit apprehensive but all went okay. 

Auction ends, all okay. Buyer gets in touch asking for the invoice from paypal so I make one and send it. I then get an email to my hotmail from ""service@paypal.co.uk"" saying the funds are being held by paypal until the item receives acknowledgement of delivery. I was skeptical so looked on paypal, and under statuses of order you can have ""hold"" on your payments. I thought that solved my uneasiness so I shipped the item.

I now realise I have been totally scammed. Paypal cannot do anything because there was no formal transaction, eBay will not do anything until 4 days after the auction due to non receipt of payment.

I have the recorded delivery number, the address, signature, name of the person, eBay account, email address etc and the buyer had positive feedback (over a hundred)...

Ebay,Is there any way I can get the shipping calculator to properly calculate costs of a US Postal Service Priority Mail Regional Rate A Box?,"I've been listing textbooks for a week now. The books I'm shipping fit snugly in [Regional Rate](https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail-regional-rate.htm) Priority Mail boxes and they're generally cheaper to ship that way than using a [Flat Rate](https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail-flat.htm) box. Usually.

However, eBay doesn't allow you to list an item with flat-cost shipping if the least expensive shipping option costs more than $4.00 - I understand why this happens, because in the past people would post misleadingly cheap auctions with artificially inflated shipping ""costs"" to trick people. For some cases this is fine, but if a textbook crosses the country I end up eating 5 or 6 dollars worth of shipping costs. So I looked into using the eBay rate calculator... except it only has options for [by-weight-and-zone Priority Mail](https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm) and Flat Rate shipping costs. Priority Mail by weight and zone winds up costing double that of the Regional Rate boxes.. and Flat Rate boxes cost about a dollar more than the most expensive shipping case for a Regional Rate box. ($9.37 vs. $10.50)

I could just list it as Priority Mail Flat Rate on eBay, then ship using Regional Boxes, but then I'd be pocketing the difference and that would be disingenuous. And possibly a violation of eBay terms and conditions...

Alternatively, I could list it as Priority Mail (the weight-and-zone kind) and set a calculator discount of 40% or 50%, which brings me close to the Regional Rate prices (for a 5lb box). But this still feels wrong. There's got to be a way to make the shipping calculator spit out Regional Rate prices properly. Anybody have an idea, or should I just switch to the $10.50 Flat Rate boxes and ignore the savings of Regional Rate?",3,1,2011-08-11,EBAY,0.07428710907697678,0.9014467000961304,0.024266157299280167
