Ebay,What would you have done?,"I both sell and buy regularly on eBay. I bought a bulk of 150 items from a seller. I received the item with four of the wrong product and 10 items missing. I asked the seller for just the 10 missing items, trying to be nice and forget about the four that were the wrong item. He responds within a couple hours saying no problem and that he would send out the missing items. He then sends another message saying for me to send the four items that were wrong and he would send me the right items. I said no, it is fine and to just send the 10. Five weeks later, I contact him again asking where my items were because I have been patiently waiting for them. He then proceeds to insult me and call me a crook, saying that he offered to send me the items once I sent the 4 to him. He said I was trying to scam him because he allegedly now sent 155 items because he was trying to be a good seller. He then said for me to send all the items back and he would refund me. The problem was, and the seller was fully aware, that I was selling the other items on eBay to make my money back and would not be able to send all of them back. I opened the case, and of course, eBay decided to refund me once I sent all 150 back, which was impossible. I left bad feedback and ended the fighting.

Ebay,Can someone please explain this scam to me?,"I'm selling an old camera that's probably broken (not sure) and I have it listed as ""for parts"".  At the beginning of the listing I got a bid from a zero feedback buyer based in Hong Kong.  I do not do international shipping and planned to cancel the sale if I got no other bids.  Once the listing was over, I immediately got the following message from the buyer:

&gt; Hi, I can pay it with visa via paypal, however, my paypal address is in HONG KONG, would you mind send the camera to my sister's home where is in LA, USA.
Looking forward to receiving your reply!

I found it very suspicious that this person waited until the sale was over to ask this question.  Most people would have asked before bidding.  Then, before I could reply, the person sent payment.  Again, I'm pretty sure most people would wait for a response before sending money.  I checked and saw that the payment does appear in both ebay and paypal.  Also, the buyer now has an address in California.  The address is ""unconfirmed"" although it is apparently still eligible for Seller Protection.

So, this appears to be a scam but I don't get how it works. It's not the fake payment email scam.  Can anyone explain it?  Am I too paranoid?  I just don't believe that someone from HK wants their first ebay purchase to be a $100 broken film camera.

Also, I don't quite know how to cancel the sale and reverse the payment.  Can I get some pointers?

THANKS!

EDIT- I have spoken to both ebay and paypal.  They looked at the transaction and seem to think it's all fine.  I guess I'll be shipping it.  I did send the buyer an email explaining again that the camera is not working and to confirm that they understand it and still want it.  I'll ship once they agree.   Thanks for all your help and yes I was being overly paranoid apparently.

I know there is a ""fixed fee"" cost each month for an ebay store, which varies based on the size of your ebay store.

Ebay,I bought an item which doesnt work as the seller said it would. I want to return it but who pays for the return cost?,"I bought an item and it doesn't work as the seller described.  Its a WiFi extender.  It works but it doesn't improve my WiFi range like it said in the advert.  In fact I would say my normal router has an equal range.

The seller said that they will accept the return but I have to pay the postage, even though the item doesn't work like it was stated.  I realise that when I return something I pay the postage, but this in my opinion, is different from a usual return.

The item will cost me about £5 to return it using recorded delivery.  I realise that I would have got the original fee but the seller worked this into the original cost and sold it P+P free.

Will I have to stump up the cost of posting it back?  The item cost me £14 so its going to cost me 1/3 of the final fee due to it not working correctly.  This cant be fair surely.

Ebay,Considering selling a Launch Day PS4 - What could go wrong?,"Hi everyone,

I am fairly inexperienced with ebay, and am contemplating selling my Launch Day PS4 that I pre-ordered from Amazon. If it sells, great, if it doesn't, hey I get to keep a PS4.

Looking at existing listings, it appears that most sellers claim to be changing their shipping address to the winner's address upon receipt of payment.

This seems a bit risky to me, is it?

- What could go wrong in this scenario?
- Are there any policies in place with PayPal / Ebay that would allow the buyer to ""take his money back"", even though I changed the shipping address?
- Does Amazon have a time window in which I would no longer be able to change the shipping address?
- Are there other risks I should look out for?
- Are there other selling strategies you would recommend (to maximize profitability and/or minimize risk)?

Ebay,My eBay account got suspended but I can prove my innocence... is there a chance it will be reinstated?,"And also, will my paypal account be safe? My paypal is more valuable to me than my ebay account, so I'm looking for advice here.

I tried to help someone out and they wanted to be to list something for them, but it was a mini vehicle of some sort (worth thousands) and it wasn't in my location. Minutes later, this listing was taken down and I was suspended.

I know that listing something you don't have, especially thousands of dollars, is against their policy. BUT my friend said he wanted to TEST the market and that if someone wanted to bid on it, I would cancel it before the bid would end.

Before this, I had 100% approval rating and I have done nothing wrong. 

I would mostly like to buy on eBay than to sell, and I can't even use my eBay account to do that and it really pisses me off. 

I will call them today but I just hope I don't have to go through something like faxing my info or something and NOT be reinstated anyway, and then something happen to my paypal account, which would be devastating.

Ebay,"UPDATE to my ""explain this scam to me"" post","[My earlier post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/1pvsr5/can_someone_please_explain_this_scam_to_me/)

I know this is not a big deal to most people but I thought I'd give an update.  I love it when people update things and this kind of info may be helpful if you're a new seller like me!

So like I said, I thought the buyer was a suspicious scammer but ebay and paypal disagreed and said I should ship.  I contacted the buyer through messaging and reiterated that the camera was not working.  I asked the buyer to confirm that they still wanted it.  I expected no reply because I still thought I was being scammed.  I eventually received a reply back but it didn't make much sense.  At this point I realized I was dealing with someone who didn't understand English very well.  I wrote back again plainly that I could cancel the transaction and send their money back if that was what they wanted.  The buyer agreed and apologized for the inconvenience. 

I told the buyer it was no trouble and that all they had to do was approve the cancel transaction case I was about to open.  After a little while I realized that refunding money was separate from canceling the sale.  So I figured out how to send the money and then BOOM cancel transaction case was DENIED.

What????  So was this a scam after all????

No, I got an message shortly afterwards that the buyer made a mistake.  I told him I'd call ebay to fix it. The buyer thanked me and apologized again.  The buyer actually left me positive feedback calling me a ""very nice seller""! This is a really big deal to me because I am new myself and don't have much feedback yet.

So, because I was overly paranoid and had everything nicely documented through messaging, ebay refunded the fees with no hassles.  I think the positive feedback also helped.  The moral of the story is that zero feedback buyer are horrible but not necessarily scammers and you should still be nice to them!  ;)

Also, I've discovered that the best way to block overseas buyers is not through ebay but through paypal.  You go through your paypal settings to block non-USA paypal accounts.  I think they are too risky because of the potential language barriers and the long/expensive shipping.  I really don't want to deal with this headache again so now, when an overseas person wins the auction, they won't be able to pay and I can cancel it more easily.

That's it.  Thanks for all the good advice!",4,20,2013-11-06,EBAY,0.052850060164928436,0.892573356628418,0.0545765645802021

The Bill is only for people who do not qualify for the Small Seller Exception, which basically states that if your gross annual receipt is UNDER $1,000,000 (a million bucks), this bill will not apply to you.


Correct me if I'm wrong, but is million-dollar-per-year business considered small?  eBay made it sound like the bill was designed specifically to work AGAINST the small business owners, but now that I've read the actual thing, it seems like it was trying to mislead me.

Ebay,Ebay seller possibly scammed me,"A few days ago I bought a new tablet off an ebay member in Hong Kong. He had around 98 positive feed back so I thought he was relatively trust able. The tablet costed 800 USD which converted to 870 AUD which is a huge amount in my eyes. Naturally I don't want to be scammed so I used my bankwest debit card linked to my paypal to pay for the item.

Fast forward several days I got my package (they posted it through FedEx priority mail). I opened it up and it was empty, with just the shell of the box for the tablet (Note 10.1 2014). Since this is such a huge amount of money, what would happen if I filed a claim with paypal or a chargeback with bankwest? Is it even possible to get my money back at this point?

Ebay,Anyone having issues with the picture zoom on your listings not working lately?,"A while back, lets say a few weeks or so I noticed that the photos on my listings were not getting the hover zoom they have always had since I started selling. I called EBAY and  they claimed it was the picture size that was causing the zoom to not work after trying to tell me I needed to use gallery view ( an extra charge ) to get the zoom to work. I told them I never used gallery view in the past and have only recently had this issue and to my knowledge I have not been doing anything differently then normal. 

So I took their word for it and figured I may have inadvertently changed a picture quality or size setting on my camera. Today I got the chance to check every thing over. Nothing was different. Same picture size and quality as my older auctions that still can zoom when hovered over. I even tried a different camera and uploaded older pictures that were larger than average that were definitely zooming in on the listing page in the past.

So I am just curious if anyone else has noticed this or was having a similar issue?

Ebay,How do I contact eBay directly? (This concerns the GSP and their HORRIBLE packaging.),"Hey guys,

I really need to find a way to contact someone at eBay directly, by e-mail preferably. I've ordered a closed loop liquid cooler for my PC and received it on Friday. They had just wrapped the original packaging in brown paper and when it arrived the box was destroyed. The liquid cooler had leaked inside the box and it got all soggy and fell appart.

I contacted the seller but as I thought, this is not his fault. It was shipped by eBay\Pitney Bowes and packaged by them. This must've been handled like shit because CoolerMaster themselves had never heard of one leaking inside the packaging. Anyway.

I was willing to let that go until I've received a motherboard I had ordered. I've just received it. I really should've taken a picture of the packaging.

It was basically inside it's original packaging (This item is second hand, the cooler was brand new.) and basically the only packaging on this is duct tape taped to the corners and such so that the box won't open.

I'm really not liking this Global Shipping Program. It's really expensive and makes it almost not worth purchasing from outside the country. For the price I'd at least expect decent packaging.

I will be installing this motherboard tonight after work. I actually have doubts that it will still work.

The way I see this new shipping program, it basically screws you over if something goes wrong during shipping. It also screws the sellers because they may receive bad feedback because of eBays lack of professionalism in their shipping department. I'm not sure if the GSP is something that has been forced upon all American sellers but it's probably screwing them over on sales as well, with the high price of shipping and all.

Anyway, if anyone could offer advice or a way to contact someone at eBay by e-mail, that'd be awesome.",8,6,2013-11-12,EBAY,0.15525388717651367,0.8147740364074707,0.029972059652209282

Ebay,"Would love the community's feedback: New Inventory, eCommerce, and Social Media Management Platform.","Hello eBayers!

So I started this conversation in r/ecommerce and i thought it would make sense to bring it over here. I’m with a young startup that was hoping you’d be interested in trying out our platform to see what you think/find bugs/ make suggestions etc.

Our site is Shopseen.com. The platform is free to use and is a one stop shop to manage your inventory and seamlessly push your products to ecommerce sites (eBay,Shopify, Etsy, Storenvy etc.) and social media sites (Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr….you get the idea). Our goal is to be your main platform to manage inventory and sell/promote your work.

Any and all feedback would be much appreciated. I have been a long time lurker to reddit so this is somewhat new to me. We'd love hear your thoughts on things: like how the platform looks, how it compares to others in the space, what you would like to see out of a platform like this. Thanks!

Ebay,eBay removed a neutral feedback I left a seller without telling me. Is this normal?,"I'm really just curious here.  I bought a DVD season of a TV show on eBay a month or so ago.  It advertised free ""expedited"" shipping.  It took a week for the item to arrive and when it did, it was a small flat-rate priority mail box wrapped in brown paper and shipped media mail.   My guess is the seller lists all dvds as ""expedited"" and ordinarily ships first class.  This being a six-disc set, probably exceeded the 13oz limit.

This torqued me off a bit.  It's not honest advertising, for one, and second of all, it's clearly a misuse of postal materials.   The product was fine, and thinking through my options, I decided a neutral feedback was fair.  

I posted a neutral feedback saying, 'Wrapping a Priority box in brown paper and shipping media mail does not constitute ""expedited"" shipping'

The seller seemed offended by this in a comment reply to the positive feedback he had left for me, but I felt it was fair.  I don't appreciate these kinds of business practices.  A few weeks later, I just happened to notice the neutral feedback I left has been removed.  It's gone, nowhere to be found.  Is it common practice for ebay to remove the comment without telling me?   

I really don't want to be seen as a bully-buyer, but by the time the DVDs came, there was nothing I really felt the seller could do, the damage had been done.  I wasn't going to try to extort a partial refund out of him, or return them on the shipping principle alone, so I felt neutral was fair.

Ebay,Attention all pickers who frequent thrift stores for things to sell on eBay!,"(I really hope this is an appropriate place to post this.)

My husband and I buy Polaroid cameras in large quantities! These are things that are easily found and thrift stores for a few bucks.  We pay roughly $10-$15 per camera.  We have a few ""pickers"" around the U.S. that we work with regularly. In short, they put together a lot of cameras (~10 or more) and we pay you a flat rate for each camera (depending on model &amp; condition) and cover shipping costs! 

Our pickers have told us that after all is said and done with eBay fees and PayPal fees, they make more profit working for us rather than posting the cameras online. It also takes away the time spent photographing each camera, making a detailed listing, and worrying about relisting if it doesn't sell.  In other words, you will already know what we pay for each camera when you buy it at a thrift store and won't have to take the gamble of, ""Will it sell on eBay?""

I opened a case and got the value fee after a week. I relisted it and the buyer did not pay, another week and I got the fee back. I relisted it for a buy it now and someone bought it today and has 0 feedback and has not paid. 

I can't require immediate payment because I am not a Paypal upgraded member. I can't leave anything but positive feedback for any of these individuals. All I can do is keep relisting it over and over and hoping someone will pay for the item. How on Earth is this excusable on Ebay? 

TL;DR I have sold the same broken PS3 4 times and 0/4 of them paid for it. I can not leave negative feedback, I can not report them, I can not require instant payment without buying an upgraded Paypal account.",19,6,2013-11-18,EBAY,0.054638806730508804,0.912108302116394,0.033252909779548645

Ebay,MC999 eBay Indefinite selling restriction,"Hi,

I hope this post doesn't get me flamed as my ego is already bruised enough. 
About 6 months ago, I was stuck in a job were I was anxious all the time and having trouble making ends meet.
I thought I'd try selling on Ebay to help with the money situation and satisfy my love of bargains and thrifting.  I was learning as I go and was doing well, I thought.  86 ratings with 100% rating trying to give excellent value and customer service.  I thought if I just kept my sellers happy, I would do well.  I dreamed of one day quiting my day job and doing ebay full time.

Those dreams were crushed recently because I received an indefinite selling restriction.  I believe it was the Vero program that brought me down.

It was my own ignorance, not maliciousness that brought me down.  I was selling purses that I didn't know anything about (2 Vero violations).  Finally, it was a $5 Harley Davidson baseball cap that brought me down. (who knew there were knock off Harley hats?  I do, now) During the Harley 30 day suspension, I read that you could have more than one ebay account and so I got impatient and started a new account and went to work building my reputation on that one.

Soon, I got the ""MC999 eBay Indefinite selling restriction"" on the original account and a few days later, the 2nd account was restricted to buying only.

Oh, how I wish I could go back in time and undo my stupid mistakes.  Why did I sell purses?  Why did I open a 2nd account?  

The thing is I have learned from my mistakes and really want to be a good seller but now I am banned for life?!  It really sucks and hurts.  I feel like someone I loved has cut me off.

I am selling a little on Amazon but mostly I have used stuff I find at thrift stores (leather jackets, Harley stuff, clothing, anything really).  Ebay was a great fit for me.  I haven't had any luck with ""vintage"" items on Etsy.

So, what can I do to get back in the game.  Is there some way for me to open another ebay account and keep going?  What do I need - a new email address, paypal account, physical address or do I need to change my name?  

I'd usually give up by now, but this really means a great deal to my happiness and hopefulness.  

Thanks for listening.

Any advice to help me get back on ebay is really appreciated.

Ebay,Sold a game code on ebay... buyer is most likely a scammer.,"I've been selling game codes for an online game that I received from an event.  It's all been relatively successful, and most of the people I've been selling to have been pleasant with lots of good feedback.  I just mail them the code and then email it to them. I've run into a snag though with a potential scammer. 

I don't know if selling game code cards is ok or not since so many game codes were being sold when I put up my auctions (in the hundreds), but right now I'm leaning toward the latter because of this specific problem I'm having.

Anyway, the guy bought the code a couple weeks ago.  He had no feedback, so I said I would send the game code card in the mail, and if he wanted it through email then he could provide some proof of identity for reassurance (since most ebay scams use fake identities anyway).  At this he started getting belligerent, demanding I send it through email right away.  If I relisted it he would probably just buy it again. So I sent the code in the mail through certified and just left it alone for awhile.

Now I see that the mail has been sitting in the post office for awhile, and it will probably be sent back to me.  I'm guessing he tried to scam the code off me (fully intending to file a complaint), and because it failed he's going to say it was never sent.

So basically I'm out $3 for shipping, but other than that, what actions should I take. I don't want to just take down the auction and return his money, because maybe he has access to that mail and might pick it up as soon as I do.  Also I would like to sell the code as it does have value and it's been relatively painless in the past (I could find other venues to do so).

Ebay,Seeking advice for (upcoming) item refused case,"Hey everyone,

I recently sold a relatively high priced (~$650) item to a buyer who seemed legitimate based on feedback. I listed for that price with free shipping and immediate payment required, and shipped via UPS Two Day within the required time frame with adult signature required (meeting all my criteria for seller protection). I also made it clear that I would not accept returns.

Well the other day the buyer gets the package, refuses it, and hasn't responded since. I'm assuming they're waiting for the seven days to lapse and file an eBay case. To the best of my understanding, eBay will side with me since the buyer nullified the Buyer Protection by refusing the package (see [here](http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/refunds.html#how)). I do want to refund the buyer, BUT I refuse to reimburse them the nearly $50 I paid for shipping or the $70 in eBay fees I've paid. 

The issue I'm having is that, apparently, if you offer only a partial refund you don't get a FVC under any circumstances. So once I receive the package back, do I offer the buyer the $650 back - $120 for the fees and the shipping, or do I just let eBay handle it? Just wanted some advice from people who've experienced similar situations.

Thanks everyone.

The problem is I can't get a clear-cut answer to which international shipping service can really guarantee the signature aspect of this. Then there's GSP.

I know all the scams going around that the buyer will claim the item was never received and I need to know if I ship GSP this won't be an issue.

Ebay,Advice: seller wants a refund despite item description properly stated,"I don't sell products regularly, and this is my first experience dealing with a dispute, so I thought I'd come here for advice. I sold a laptop recently on ebay. It's broken, it turns on, starts to boot but never fully boots. I listed this item with a buy it now option and stated that it turns on but does not fully boot, and that I don't know what the problem is. I included pictures of the item turned off, 'attempting to boot' and at a blue screen where it stays.  I even made an additional comment in the description not to bid on the item with the expectation that this will work out of the box.

Now the seller has filed a dispute claiming the laptop is not as described because there are lines on the display and claims its a motherboard issue. I'm pretty sure I have a solid case, as I never said it worked or what was wrong with it (I honestly do not know what was wrong), but im curious what etiquette is here. I stated no refunds, the buyer never asked me any questions before buying (they didn't even bid, just did buy it now) and is trying to claim that because I didn't include that the display had lines on it (just a picture of it), that I should give a refund.

Thoughts?

I have been an eBayer for 10 years. In the last few months, I've had buyers just decide that they were not going to honor their commitment(no reason provided, they just weren't going to pay). It feels to me these buyers are just going along their way, winning auctions, not paying, and getting away with it. I want to know if the latter half is true. Is eBay penalizing repeat non-payers. This behavior is unfair not only to the seller but to the other bidders. 

In my most recent case, the winning bidder refused to pay, no reason provided. I contacted the other bidders, but it was too late for them to use my particular item because of a time constraint. I was willing to give the other bidders the item for free because I did not want to see it go to waste. Because the winning bidder flaked out, the other bidders lost on an opportunity. And that makes me mad.

Ebay,"Seller claims they didn't know item was a counterfeit, don't know what to do.","So I bought an item off eBay, it turns out it's a fake of the product I was expecting to buy. It was selling for 200 for what usually retails for 250 in stores so I didn't think that was unrealistic so I made the purchase. Upon opening, it is clearly a fake. 90% of it looks fine and it may even work fine too (not going to use it in case it needs to be returned). The seller claims he thought it was real (it is something that doesn't fit into the category of the rest of the items he sells). He offered a full refund and return or  to take 20% off the price. I'm conflicted because if I return the item he could very well sell the item again to somebody else who might not be able to tell it's a fake and they might get the short end of the stick.

Ebay,Seller won't ship item,"I won an auction for a crystal clock at the starting bid of $0.99 plus $12 shipping. As with all my eBay purchases, I paid instantly.

He finally emailed and said the item had been returned to him by the USPS damaged. He refunded my $12.99. Which is fairly bogus as the clock belongs to me and it isn't within his discretion to make that unilateral decision. At a minimum, he should have at least asked what I wanted. 

I don't believe his story. Had he delivered the package to the post office, they would have scanned it and there would be at least some tracking against the number. It's USPS policy to deliver the package, even damaged, the the address on the label. Obviously that didn't happen. The clocks value is probably between $20 and $50.

Ebay,Ebay International Shipping program shipped to wrong address... What do I do?,"I have a bit of a problem. I recently sold an n64 game on ebay via the international shipping program. Basically, you send it to an address given to you by ebay (some random shipping center), and they take care of the rest. This means that I was not given the buyer's real address, but rather, just told what shipping center to send it to. I believe this means that eBay uses the address given to them by the seller. It does, however, have tracking.

So, this guy claims that after a month he never received the item a month later and opened a dispute. I look at the tracking, and it was delivered to somewhere in his neighborhood (with signature) last month. He claims that this is because the address is wrong (a different house in his area, his address was 175a, not 175). However, either ebay messed up, or he had the wrong address attached to his ebay account.  I suspect it was the latter.

I would just refund him and be done with it, but i'm afraid of strikes against my account or him being able to still leave me negative feedback.

I did some searching and saw that eBay does updates on Thursday nights and not to worry, everything should be back by late Friday.  Well, it isn't and my watch list is still missing over 180 items.  When I go back to the auctions of some of the items I was watching, it still says I am watching them even though they do not appear in my watch list.  Is there anything I can do?",10,5,2013-11-30,EBAY,0.17974916100502014,0.7934703826904297,0.026780448853969574

Ebay,"First time selling, sent via USPS, package stuck at post office","So as the title states I recently sold an item worth about $530 via eBay and sent it via USPS (since it was the most convenient route at the time, with signature confirmation but no insurance..).  I shipped it on the 25th via Priority Mail from Arlington, VA to Baltimore, MD which is about 50 or so miles away.  I've been tracking the package ever since and the last update was on the 26th at 7:45AM stating ""Arrival at Post Office"" at Brooklyn, MD (the post office closest to the buyer's home).  I've been back and forth with the customer service reps and ended up filing at report yesterday morning.  Long story short the manager of the post office where I shipped my item called me back last evening and told me there was a problem with the label.  He wasn't really specific but said it SHOULD be delivered today.  I've been checking all day and so far nothing has changed.  After calling back several times and I was finally able to talk to an employee from the main post office in Baltimore but still no update and was asked to call back Monday.

My question is, has this ever happened to anyone?  Do you think the package is lost?  I've tried to contacted the buyer everyday to keep him updated but has not replied to even a single message.

Thanks in advance!",2,0,2013-11-30,EBAY,0.030231747776269913,0.9065486192703247,0.06321961432695389
Ebay,Need help paying after winning auction,"A few minutes ago I won an ebay auction for my first time. I do have an active pay pall account. After I won the auction I clicked ""pay now"". It then had an option that told me how much I owed and said ""continue to paypal to to complete purchase"", i hit ""continue"". I entered my password and continued. My paypal account is linked to my checking account, which I have a debit card for. Now a page is asking me to add a new credit card before proceeding.

I don't want to do this. I have a debit card and money in my paypal account, but when I click continue it asks me to add a credit card. At the top though it says please add a debit or credit card to your paypal account. I would like to enter my debit card info, but it's only letting me enter a credit card.

What do I do?",0,0,2013-11-30,EBAY,0.02083035558462143,0.9218147397041321,0.05735493823885918
Ebay,Did I screw up as a buyer not asking for a refund before accepting the sellers request to cancel the transaction?,"I bought [this] (http://www.ebay.com/itm/390698054872?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649) yesterday and i changed my mind a few hours later after paying for it with paypal. I noticed that it was coming out of a China and there was a good chance it wasnt going to be legit. 

I sent a message to the seller saying that i want to cancel. They marked the item as shipped and then they messaged me and said that they will hold the package and cancel the transaction after they receive nice feedback. So i left nice feedback and they sent me a cancel transaction request which i accepted right away. Now the transaction is canceled and i didnt get a refund yet. The payment symbol changed to two blue lines saying that a dispute process has blocked you from making payment. But i already paid. I dont know what to do. I contacted the seller today requesting a refund but i haven heard back from them.",8,0,2013-11-30,EBAY,0.07935573905706406,0.877507209777832,0.043137092143297195

Ebay,Selling Next-gen Consoles,"Dear r/Ebay,

I'm am planning on buying myself an Xbox One for Christmas. When I was looking at prices and the amount of money that I have, I noticed that I have enough in my bank account to purchase two. The thought crossed my mind to buy two and sell the second one at Christmas time when everybody wants one and make some cash for the holidays. I have a few questions though:

1. Will it be I at least be guaranteed to make my money back?

2. How do I make sure that a potential buyer will actually buy it and not flake?

3. Is this even a smart idea or is it too much trouble to bother with?

Thanks a bunch in advance.",6,0,2013-11-30,EBAY,0.025057978928089142,0.8884932994842529,0.08644876629114151
Ebay,Be cautious with warranties included with auctions,"I had recently purchased a projector from a top rated seller who included a warranty with it. Since projectors are prone to break easily I thought this was a good buy. The projector came and a major function of it was broken. I opened a case and contacted the seller, who responded saying I should be talking to the people on the included warranty. I went ahead and contacted them and sent it in for repair. It took about two months for them to diagnose it as being non-repairable and they told me they didn't have a comparable replacement, only a cheaper model. By this time the case was closed and I couldn't leave feedback. I messaged the seller and haven't heard from them since. 

Aside from my error of not escalating the case as soon as possible, is there anything I can do to make my situation better?",3,0,2013-11-30,EBAY,0.05515759438276291,0.8926110863685608,0.052231352776288986
