Ebay,Need advice on sold iPhone 5s,"So I sold an iPhone 5s on ebay in a buy it now auction, from reading around apparently iPhones and other cell phones are rife for people doing the ""item not as described"" scam, then getting their money back and sending back something else. Most of the threads I read were a few years old though. Has anything changed that gives the seller a little more assurance? 
Side Points
* I only selected shipping to United States to avoid international hassle, and while the buyers paypal address is in New York and is CONFIRMED his ebay profile states he is located in Saudi Arabia. My thought is that he may not fear legal repercussion after sending the phone to himself and filing a fraudulent claim. 
* I messaged him twice asking if he understood everything about the phone so we could avoid a return. He didn't respond to either.
* He has 53 positive feedback all as a buyer. None of the items had a item number to tell what it was but a lot of the items were for various iPhone accessories and one of the buyers that left positive feedback for him was a major ebay seller of DUMMY phones along with other electronics. Also I couldn't find feedback left from him. Maybe he just doesn't speak English which could explain him not answering my messages but he could also be just receiving the quick feedback from major sellers and then opening fraudelent cases afterwards.
So all in all I understand if I send the phone with delivery and signature confirmation then I can avoid some scams but not the ""item not as described"" scam. So the way I see it my options are either 
*A) Refund his money and relist it with a buy it now/best offer that is really high and explain in the description I am weeding out potential scammers and filtering offers
or
*B) Send the item with delivery and signature confirmation and message the buyer stating that I have fully documented, pictures and video and ""ebay approved marking method"" according to a blog I just read"", everything about the phone including imei number, functionality, etc. I was even thinking, has anyone, that you know or have read of, ever countered a fraudulent claim with video evidence showing the phone being fully functional and the imei number? That way if they do pull the refund scam you can then also video the opening of their returned package which doesn't contain the phone and send that to paypal/ebay as evidence? Or do they not really care.
Lastly if I do play it safe and refund his money then I don't have to pay any ebay or paypal fees for the listing correct? Also the only refund option I saw involved us both accepting, is there one for seller denial? I was trying to avoid doing the refund route because I slightly fear negative feedback because as of now I have 100% feedback but only 14 sales so it would hurt me. But at the same time he may not leave feedback because he doesn't seem to leave any anyway and he may fear my feedback as well. Thanks for any feedback, I may be over paranoid but I don't feel like losing out on 6/700 bucks.",0.0,2,2014-01-02,EBAY,0.10207030177116394,0.870381236076355,0.027548495680093765
Ebay,Odd Predicament,"I sold an item for the first time in a while on ebay in early December.

Ebay,Item not arrived 60 days after payment and the window has closed for opening a case with eBay. Am I shit out of luck?,"I purchased an item from a Hong Kong based seller a couple of months ago. They promised the item would arrive within 30 days but when there was no sign of it after a month I contacted them. After a bit of back and forth they gave me some guff about it being lost at the HK post office and promised to send a replacement. No problem for me, fortunately I wasn't in a huge rush so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I message them back telling them all was OK and promptly forgot about the transaction.

The problem is, ebay only offer resolution centre support for transactions that are less than 45 days old. My paypal payment was send about 60 days ago.

Ebay,Received an item with postage due. Seller refuses to reimburse.,"The short version of the story is that I ordered something on eBay and the seller shipped it at a flat rate but didn't use the flat rate packaging. The package came with $8.50 postage due.

The seller is being difficult about the situation. They don't want to pay the additional shipping. Package is currently sitting at the post office.

Here's the thing: I really want the item at the price I paid for it but I think the seller would rather have the item returned and just take a loss on their initial shipping cost (the insufficient shipping cost).

Ebay,Is this normal or should I be on alert?,"I listed an iPhone 4 for sale yesterday morning and in just a few hours it sold for my Buy it Now price. I was pretty ecstatic and I expected payment immediately since this is usually what one does when one purchases an item. 

It's been about a day now, 24hrs, and no payment yet. I contacted the buyer earlier with the invoice telling them thanks for choosing my purchase and congrats on winning and that I would ship as soon as payment clears, the usual.

My concern is that they are not going to pay at all and will cause me to miss out of making money if I can simply re-list it. Is this normal for a buyer not to pay immediately? Should I look for signs of possible buyer negligence/fraud? They only have 4 feedback but have been a member for 3 years now. Their address is a P.O.

Ebay,"I'm probably completely screwed, right?","I am wondering if I am completely out of luck with my recent sale. So, I sold an almost new, expensive smartphone on ebay. I'm not a reseller, I just wanted to get a smaller phone instead. The auction ended on December 10th, shipping it out the next day. The tracking information shows it departing a sort facility on December 12th, and then there are no more updates.  So, now that it is has been almost 3 weeks, the buyer contacts me, understandably pissed. I thought that the tracking information just didn't update, but apparently the item has yet to show up. So I called 1800-ASK-USPS, which was what the internet told me is the only way to get them to research and at least find out what is up with my package.

It has been three days, and they haven't called me back or updated the tracking information. This leads me to suspect that it is lost or stolen.

I also made the mistake of not putting insurance on the item. I know this is my fault, but the seller got extremely mad at me for not offering free rush delivery on the phone (only free 2 day priority, as stated in the auction). He was already threatening to leave me negative feedback, so, I wasn't feeling particularly nice about wanting to throw in insurance. I realize that this was only hurting me, but that's my lame excuse. I will say that I did not advertise that I was offering insurance in the auction, nor did the buyer ask for it.

So, does this sound like USPS lost the item, and will I most likely have to refund the money to the buyer and accept the loss of the item? Does it sound like I'm about to learn a $1,200 lesson in getting insurance for all shipped items?",6.0,1,2014-01-04,EBAY,0.06334196031093597,0.9015170335769653,0.03514103218913078
Ebay,Inquiries about selling a smartphone to Europe/International from U.S. Help!,"I've never sold anything on ebay before as I usually just purchase items and have a +7 rating (100%). So I recently asked my friend traveling through Dubai to purchase for me a smartphone (Galaxy Note 3 unlocked) hoping to get a good deal. He gets it for me and the phone works great in the US (At&amp;t) calls and text are the same. However the model of the phone doesn't support the 4G bandwidths in the US so I'm stuck with very low speeds. It's more so designed for 4G let networks in throughout the rest of the world. I can't return it so I want to sell it to someone that can take advantage of all the features as I imagine selling to US based buyers wouldn't be completely fair if they expect 4G lte. I'm even willing to take a substantial loss just because I need the money to purchase the T- Mobile version (no contract)

Ebay,"December was an awesome month for me, this month not so much.","I have had the gamut of problems from last month's sales.

I told him to return it and I'd refund him, he said he'd call ebay and make sure to give me a good report after I stuck to my guns on the return. 

 A 3rd buyer said they are going to neg me because their package arrived damaged and there was nothing I could do to change their minds.

I am about to list an iPhone 4s as a 30-day BIN with Best Offer, but will only accept offers from buyers with a solid track record. I will price it a little north of average and will be recording the ESN and verify that it is clean with the carrier before listing.

I'd like to have a safe, easy sale the first time around, but I also know that iPhones are a big target for fraudsters.

Ebay,Help A Seller With A Delinquent Buyer!,"I want to make this as short and to the point as I can, so please excuse any length!  I recently had a toy wrestling belt listed on EBay for a ""Buy It Now or Best Offer"" price.  I eventually came to an agreement with a buyer for $28 + $9 shipping (weird shaped box that was the reason the item was worth anything).  I purchased a box that cost $6.25 (because of the dimensions) and found out the shipping would be close to $15.  I'm still fine with this transaction until the buyer did not pay.  I sent two very friendly reminders (as he had 100% positive feedback I figured it was a mistake) to which were ignored and I eventually had to open an unpaid claim (after 8 days).  I eventually saw that he was still actively on EBay as he ignored my messages leaving feedback for others.

EBay's claim said I could return as soon as today to close the claim and not be charged with any fees because of a delinquent buyer.  When I wake up today the buyer has paid for the item.  If he was willing to not pay for so long, not respond to any messages, and just be a general pain - why am I to trust that he isn't going to say the item arrived damaged or there is something wrong?  I wouldn't be as worried if I was not $20+ in the hole just from sending it out (I'm a college kid!).  

So my question is - is there any way to protect myself prior to sending this item out?  I can essentially almost guarantee that outside of being run over by a car that this item is packaged EXTREMELY WELL.  Do I have any options right now or am I essentially at the mercy of this pain in the neck buyer?

Ebay,Question about potential harassment from a buyer.,"So I had a buyer of an item apparently not open their package a month and a half after the purchase and claim it's not as described, which is totally bullshit but whatever. I tell them no problem, sorry it didn't work out and that I'll happily refund them upon them mailing it back, no biggie. Keep the asshole happy since this is eBay and the buyer's have all the power. I gave them my return address and they messaged me back asking for my phone number.

Now I've been doing this eBay thing for a few months now and have dealt with two returns no issue. Never before whilst shipping sold things or accepting returns has anyone's phone number been a requirement. 

I told this person I'm not comfortable giving out my phone number and do not see the necessity for them simply shipping it back. My fear being they sell my number and get me on a shit load of call lists. They put in an information request which I was unaware that anyone could do that to obtain my phone number anyway. Well low and behold my phones been getting spam texts and calls along with my email. I'm getting really worried since now I'm receiving emails about my inquiry for loans from banks I've never heard of. My next course of action obviously is to call eBay but I'm afraid it's too late and that this is the tip of the iceberg. 

I've only been eBaying in my freetime to help survive since my 9 to 5 doesn't pay me close to enough. I've been so poor my entire life but I've always been diligent about NEVER missing a payment and keeping my credit in excellent standing. Now I'm terrified that all my hard work and diligence is about to be undone by some cuntbag that's personally offended that they don't know how to read let alone bothered to look at the pictures of the item, which were very detailed and high res mind you. 

I guess my question is how bad can this get? They have my name, address, and now my phone number? Is eBay even going to give a shit?",6.0,1,2014-01-06,EBAY,0.08478306233882904,0.8901577591896057,0.025059226900339127

Ebay,Feedback system blocks a seller,"So, I've been doing business on eBay for a while now. 6 months to be precise. Everything has been going well, until last week. I've sold some posters mid-december to a guy in Colorado, I am in Belgium. He paid me fast, and I shipped the posters (well wrapped) in a thick cardboard tube. 

On the 26'th of December he receives his package, and on the 3rd of January he gives me a negative feedback. I'm totally stunned by this. Some way, the tube got smashed by something or someone and there is a wrinkle in the poster. These thing happen, that is why communication exists. The guy gives me no communication or what so ever, so I contact him. 

I tell him I am not happy with the way things went, giving me a stab in the back with negative feedback on my profile, without doing communication (not literaly said this, stab in the back, but this is what I meant). He replies a couple of hours later telling: 'I don't have time to waste' so I give negative feedback. 

Here is the part, I think is wrong. How can somebody give feedback, without even noticing me about the problem. I would have refunded, even a full refund (about $400), but he did not want to, because he has no time. He did not even try to communicate, he doesn't even bother.. 

How is this protecting a seller, eBay? I've done some good selling in only 6 months, giving you guys lots of revenue, and now this.. 

Don't you guys think a buyer should only be able to give negative feedback on a sale after a message to the seller, or after a case is opened? After they even tried to fix the problem?

Ebay,Question regarding cash on collection,"Hi,

I am bidding on an item that will likely go for + and this is my first time buying off ebay. It's a delicate item so it cannot be posted however he agreed to deliver it to me for fuel cost. The item that is being sold just says paypal next to the payment option but I asked if we could do cash on collection and he agreed to that. I'm just wondering how this all works as I've never bought through ebay before and I'm assuming he could just say that I never paid for the item because it wont be going through paypal. He has very good rep and has been using Ebay for a long time but as I'm inexperienced with ebay I'm a bit concerned and would like some advice please. Thank you",1.0,1,2014-01-08,EBAY,0.024428166449069977,0.9238009452819824,0.05177091807126999
Ebay,"Surprise, I'm a ""bad buyer""!","Okay, I'm in Canada.  I bought a small collection of kid's toys from a seller in Michigan, $25.  However, I couldn't pay for the item until the seller submitted the shipping costs.

After a couple of days, the seller came back with the shipping cost:  $50.  On top of a $25 order.  I was very polite and simply said I couldn't do that.  I wouldn't have committed to buy the items had I known they'd cost me $75.

A couple of days pass, seller today updated shipping costs to $12.  One of the line items is an additional unexplained $5.  I guess it's a tip I owe them.

Then right after that, like an hour later, the seller launches an ""Unpaid Item Case"".  Obviously everyone must know that an unpaid item case means: pay up or your account gets suspended.  The truth is, I don't want to give this person a dime, after doing this.  

Unfortunately there's absolutely nothing in dispute resolution to help the seller about the original issue, which was the fact that hidden international shipping costs could NAIL you.  After you commit to buy at a certain price, if the seller arbitrarily decides that shipping costs will be...oh, let's say $100, you're completely at their mercy and the only solution is to pay out.

Q:  Given that there's literally nothing in the resolution center that acknowledges that a seller might be acting in what appears to be a bit of a shady way with regards to surprise shipping costs, why does eBay appear to be so rigid with regards to protecting the seller?

Q:  Why can't the seller just say ""fine"" and cancel the transaction and list it again?  Is that not a button they can click?  Or is this really about just having a bit of a power trip and attempting to make life difficult for someone else because they suddenly have the opportunity?

Ebay,Safeguarding old ebay businesses from new business - I don't want any risk of cross contamination.,"I have 2 ebay businesses under the same name which are both currently TRS and 2~ years old with a cumulative turnover of around £100k+. 

I have a new opportunity to open a furniture business which would be based in the UK, everything is more or less ready to go as soon as I want to.

After reading about 10-20 threads in the past 6 months on here about people being banned because of the new guardrail I think it's best I will not link my ebay businesses together under the same name/address/IP.

The new business is already operational in another country and is very successful - however it has a high % of broken furniture upon arrival and I am willing to accept this on the website based business but for ebay I just know this will get low DSR to a certain extent regardless of how I solve the problem.

As the new business would be a partnership I'm thinking it would be ideal to use the partners name for things like paypal as this won't affiliate the business with me directly on the systems of ebay &amp; paypal? Also does anyone else do anything like this and use a VPN?

TL;DR - Have 2 ebay businesses, can set up a 3rd but don't want low DSR's from the new business to ruin all 3 businesses as I can't afford to get kicked from ebay. Please give me some workarounds.",8.0,3,2014-01-09,EBAY,0.04036818444728851,0.9208921194076538,0.038739725947380066

In that listing for the book, it did show a photo of three books from the same author. This is because I have a whole box full of books that I want to sell; so to save time, I grouped similar books together and took fewer photos. Another advantage is that buyers are aware of what other similar products I am selling.

Now, there was no way I was trying to make it ambiguous. I specifically identified one book in the title and description for each listing (also including the information from the eBay catalogue).

Also, the price for the single book was very reasonable. Compared to other listings of the same title, it is among the cheapest - so there is no reason for the buyer to believe that she is receiving all three books for that price.

TL; DR: A buyer was silly and did not read the title/description at all and thought she would be getting everything from the photo.",7.0,0,2014-01-11,EBAY,0.023712795227766037,0.923949122428894,0.05233807861804962

Ebay,Thoughts on all the complaints about eBay and a warning for 2015.,"I was going to post this as a reply to the ""[All Faith in eBay Gone...](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/1uxqgj/all_faith_in_ebay_gone_its_obvious_they_dont_even/)"" thread, but the length got a little out of hand, so here are my thoughts:

Holy shit, this place is starting to turn into the same pit of despair that eBay's forum is. The fact that /u/onlinebizguy is getting downvoted to zero after offering solid advice and experience is seriously making the question the validity of any content on this sub-reddit.

I'm a small time seller that's trying to scale my business, in fact I just got my turquoise star a few weeks ago. But even I know that you MUST have a return policy, the fact that eBay even offers no returns is idiotic. 

eBay is a business that needs to be competitive with places like [Amazon and big retailers that are starting to eat eBay's lunch](http://allthingsd.com/20131024/as-amazon-reports-third-quarter-earnings-its-holiday-outlook-will-take-center-stage/). The big appeal of those places is often the fact they offer free shipping, one day handling (Amazon wants to do SAME DAY delivery) and easy returns. You think that eBay is ""ok"" with your no return policy, long-ass, overpriced shipping? HELL NO, youre a burden to them!

The fact that eBay is pushing their [""hassle free returns"" and offering massive bonuses for it](http://community.ebay.com/t5/Clothing-Shoes-Accessories/Welcome-to-quot-hassle-free-returns-quot-for-the-Holiday-selling/td-p/17053547) (and I guarantee that it will become a near-requirement to be top rated soon, just like one day shipping) shows you it's not really optional to have a return policy anymore.

I don't know if it's just the people that have been with eBay since the beginning that are stuck in their ways or incompetent one-off sellers, but people need to wake the fuck up and start offering:

* One day handling
* 14 day returns and consider opting into hassle free returns
* Free shipping for lighter items
* International shipping through GSP
* And don't EVER argue with a customer

I can GUARANTEE that this will not be optional by the end of this year once eBay [finishes their Cassini search engine](http://www.terapeak.com/blog/2013/06/11/terapeak-how-to-crucial-factors-in-ebay-search-for-the-new-cassini-platform), people realize the severity of the [""Quick Decline"" program](http://auctionsitenews.com/ebay-guardrail/), and start seeing their sales drop if they don't offer the above because their items are all the way on page 10.

I apologize for the language, but all this whining about ""FeeBay"" and how it doesn't give a shit about small time seller just pisses me off. If you don't like it then STOP SELLING! Nobody is forcing you, go make your own website or try selling on etsy or some other site and see how long you last.

Ebay,Customer Claims Item Doesn't Work Because of Packaging,"Basically, I sold an old PS3 Fat Blu Ray Drive.

*""Okay, I will go ahead and fill out the claim form. As for eBay and Paypal. You need to go manually refund my payment. The other option is for me to open a case against you, but that is a permanent black mark on your account as a seller, so that's really not idea. It's much, much better for you to just take care of the refund manually. Once that is done, then you can open a case with me to cancel the transaction. This was cancel the eBay sale (this part comes after the refund) and it will refund your final value fee that you paid to ebay. As for Paypal, when you refund my payment, it will refund what you actually received (the total -2%) and paypal will fill in the 2% that they took in the first place.

Ebay,eBay Australia gets around 7.3 million visitors a month. Which means that about one third of all Australians are eBay crazy. Huge success story on eBay Australia ...,"eBay Australia gets around 7.3 million visitors a month. The population of Australia is approximately 23 million which means that about one third of all Australians are eBay crazy!

The figures are extraordinary, for example more than 50% of all adults in Australia are registered with eBay.

What gave the Oz site a boost a few years ago was the reluctance of traditional retailers to embrace selling online and so sites like Amazon and eBay stepped in to meet Australians desire to buy and sell on the internet.

eBay Australia has had more than it's share of bizarre listings, three of the best that I have come across are...

A grain of Nutri-Grain which sold for $1,035 because it looked like ET!

The last Holden Monaro car ever made going for an eye watering $187,600.

My all time favourite is when some joker put New Zealand up for sale! The bidding reached $3,000 before eBay decide to take down the listing on the basis that the person selling New Zealand probably didn't own it in the first place.

Australians have a wonderful, irreverent, sense of humour but among the stories of the weird and wonderful are examples of some of the worlds greatest success stories when it comes to using eBay as a source of regular income. None more dramatic than that of Matt and Amanda Clarkson.

In 2006 They were close to being flat broke, he was a self employed carpenter and she sold pies from an old van. They have gone onto selling more than 8 million dollars worth of products on eBay. They both left school at 16 without any significant qualifications and now earn close to a million dollars a year. Armed only with an old computer and a burning desire to succeed they went from penury to eBay millionaires in just two year.

They worked ridiculously long hours and sold everything from their home that was no longer required. When they ran out of stuff to sell and noticing that camping equipment was amongst the best sellers they took a huge risk and ordered a container load of that included cool boxes and camping fridges. They almost doubled their money and the turnover of their home based business began to rise sharply.

They reinvested their profits in more stock and courses to improve their knowledge of internet marketing. Their focus and hard work has resulted in them enjoying the lifestyle that, a short time ago, they could only dream of.

In terms of material processions their efforts on eBay Australia has led the Clarksons to owning a beach front mansion on Australia's Gold Coast, a fifty foot yacht, top of the range watches, cars and clothes. Indeed Amanda Clarkson admits to once buying 14 pairs of designer shoes on a shopping trip to New York!

Perhaps more importantly is the fact that the Clarksons, who come from modest beginnings, are delighted to be in a position to ensure that their parents will enjoy a retirement that will be happy and free of stress.

Although this story features a couple who used the popularity of the worlds largest online auction house in Australia and Australians love of eBay to make their fortune it does mean that anyone, virtually anywhere in the world, has the opportunity to make a significant improvement to their finances by selling online.

eBay has branches in more than thirty countries so home based entrepreneurship is not confined to eBay Australia. However if you are determined to be the next eBay millionaire it might not be a good idea to begin your online career by attempting to sell another country!

Ebay,"Sold video card, buyer paid but now wants discount","I listed a Radeon HD 4650 AGP on eBay with a ""buy it now"" price of $45, and I enabled the option to receive a buyer's best offer. Last night, someone purchased the video card, in full, (total $60.25 with shipping) but immediately sent me the following message:

**Dear [redacted],**

**i was looking to get this item asap i only had budget of $50 if you can discount the item any i would** **appreciate any help if you can help you**
**go to pay pal and give partial refund that way thank you for your attention**



**- [redacted]**

This looks suspicous to me. I have a gut feeling that this user will scam me out of the card and the money. It seems like if I agree to selling it to him for the $50, my gut says that he would receive the card and file a case with eBay and PayPal for a refund. I don't want to deal with any of this nonsense. So, I promptly added the buyer to my blocked bidders list and contacted eBay.

Anyway, the buyer suprisingly has 100% positive feedback (as do I). If it's a legit offer, I would maybe consider it based on his feedback score alone. But I really don't want to risk losing my item and money.  This was my reponse to him this morning (sent through eBay, CC'd to myself):

**Dear [redacted],**

**I really wish you would have contacted me about this prior to purchasing the item. If you submitted an offer** **then we could have worked something out. As it stands, the total came to $60.25. You sent me a** **payment in that amount which means you agreed to purchase the card for that price. If you don't want the** **card for what you paid for it, rather than dragging this out, just tell me now and I will refund your money** **and relist the item. It feels like you're basically trying to coerce me into giving you the item for less than** **what you just paid for it, essentially holding my feedback rating and seller reputation hostage. If this is** **not the case, I apologize 100%.**

**Let me know what you want to do. If you don't want to honor your payment, please tell me now and I will** **relist the item.**

Can you describe the condition of the camera? Is it functional?

Your auction does not have a description of the camera besides ""Used"". Does the camera work? Is there any damage to it? Anything that isn't apparently obvious from the photo?

**In what regard?**

Does the camera work? Is it clean? Is it damaged in any way.

**It's a Shanghai Seagull 4A-105 Film Camera**

Yes. I understand that. Does the camera work? If I buy it, will I be able to take pictures using the camera? Is there any damage to the camera?

**It's mostly black.  Is that what you mean?**

Do you speak English as your first language? I feel like you are not understanding my questions at all.

**Who is this?**

I am a person who is interested in buying the camera you have listed for sale. I have sent you several reasonable questions which I have explained several times and you do not seem to understand me as you have not answered my questions at all. 

If I am going to send you money for this camera I will need more information other than what you listed in the auction. Can you answer questions about your item?

Ebay,"Gave a partial refund via Paypal, how to I get a credit back on my eBay account?","Hi /r/ebay,
First of all thanks for taking time to help me.. I want to ask a question since it is not clear while looking online.

 I sold two pairs of very expensive shoes. When I checked my stock, I realized that I didn't have the pair I had advertised but I had two other colors of the same shoe.  I really wanted the sale and since they are difficult to find in this size, I knew the buyers would be disappointed that I didn't have the exact color but figured they may want the other colors since all of them are rare and difficult to find.
I offered them another color and said that I would refund the shipping cost ($25) as an act of good faith. 

I refunded through Paypal but I still am on the hook for $5 in eBay fees and I don't know how to get that back. How can I do this?

Ebay,Bought a broken PS3. Seller won't refund me. Am I in the right here?,"The title of his sale was just the regular ""Sony Playstation 3 yada yada""; he made no mention of it being defective in the header.

The description only says this about the console:

&gt;The console is in perfect condition physically, it has a tendency to pause from time to time whilst going through the menu. I have no idea why this happens or if it happens when playing games but bare this in mind when purchasing this.

Now to me, this seems like a description of a minor fault. That is not the case. If it had a tendency to pause I wouldn't care; this ""tendency"" has totally rendered the console useless. It won't even play games at all. It hardly functions.

Obviously I emailed him and he just told me that I'm wrong, he won't refund me and I should sell it to someone else. Opened a dispute because (unlike some people) I'm not willing to hunk off a broken piece of shit for near retail price.

Am I in the right here? It seems like he's just butthurt that he has to deal with this. I've sold faulty things (by mistake) on eBay before and I immediately offer full refunds and let them keep the item. I don't see why other people can't just try not to scam people.

She told me, in an eBay message, that no she didn't say anything to the postman.

She now says that there is a small dent on the netbook (that I can't see in the photos she sent) and wants a full refund. She hasn't even tried to use the netbook, only turned it on. She said the screen turned off by itself (which I explained is the power saving) and she is worried there is internal damage.

There might well be, but I feel that this is nothing to do with me. 

I feel that she should take responsibility for not saying anything to the postman and for accepting such a damaged box. I'd not have accepted the item. Electronics in a box like that? No chance.

Ebay,"[Update] Guy who sold me broken PS3 won't admit he's wrong, but offers me refund and then does something hilarious.","So I made a thread yesterday about a guy selling me a broken PS3. The gist of it was:

\&gt;Sells PS3 but doesn't explain properly what's wrong with it.

\&gt;Gets mad at me because I want a refund and he won't take it back.

\&gt;The item was listed as **Used** not **Broken** so he's entirely in the wrong and won't accept that.

So he offers me a ridiculous ultimatum that I've accepted because to be honest I can't be bothered with this shit any more.

Basically he's selling the item again, but *I have to post it* to the person who wins the bid. This way I'm not losing any more money because instead of returning it to him I'm just passing it on to someone else. The person who receives it won't get my details or anything.

If he sells it to someone abroad or something he can go fuck himself because I'm not paying the postage.

It's funny because he seems to doubt that eBay will take my side in this - as though I'm in the wrong.

So for shits and giggles I check his eBay account and lo and behold the PS3 is there being sold again, although this time it's under the category of **broken** and he's properly given an explanation of the fault.

So he won't admit he's wrong *to me* but he will actually list it properly on eBay this time. I bet it sells for like £20.

Anyway, is this a bad idea accepting his stupid offer?

Ebay,Had my eBay account for 15 years. Haven't sold anything in a while. Kind of scared to sell anything after what I've read. Advice please.,"Was researching the new fees and what not, and now I'm almost scared to sell anything on eBay.  Sounds like it's super easy to get ripped off with the buyer protection thing.  What I want to sell is an unopened cellphone that per my Completed Auction/Sold auction research, I should have no problem getting 375-400 bucks.  I have 100% rating, never have had one single negative feedback left.  I have over 100 seller rating.  I sold something in 2009 and the money was held until the buyer left positive feedback, which I thought was silly.  But I was only one positive feedback away from being able to get the money immediately.  I sold something again maybe in 2010, and got the money immediately because I was finally at that status.

Seems like all the buyer has to do is give any reason, then they get a refund, and I'm out the cost of shipping and what not, and probably negative feedback.  On top of that, this phone is unopened, and I'd prefer to keep it that way.  That is why I am not putting it on craigslist.  I figure a buyer on craigslist will want to open it and mess around with it, and then if they don't want it, I am stuck with an opened phone.

The fact that my phone is unopened appears to make it worth 50-75 more according to the completed auctions.

Ebay,Buyer left 1 star DSR rating because there was no communication. Ebay policy states that isn't allowed,"I had a buyer leave me my first 1 star DSR rating for communication, and they also left positive feedback saying they left a 1 star. Ebay policy states that if there is no communication between the buyer and seller, that's a sign of good selling practices, and the buyer is only allowed to leave a 5 star rating. I called ebay, and after 30 minutes with the Trust &amp; Safety department, the rep assured me there is no such policy and that the DSR will remain. So, I found the policy myself on ebay (link below) and showed the rep, where it clearly says. He said that since the buyer also left a positive feedback, that he could not remove the 1 star rating. I then asked for a supervisor, and after 15 minutes on hold I got disconnected. The policy says nothing about it's ok to leave a 1 star rating if you also leave positive feedback. It states specifically that only a 5 star rating is allowed. It's very concerning because I did everything perfectly on the transaction, and only a couple low DSRs can cost me my top rated status.

Ebay,Priority/Priority Express Shipping Mistake,"So I ordered shipping materials (boxes, envelopes) from USPS and have been using both to ship products to customers. Somebody sent me a message and said that it would cost $16 extra dollars (the original order total was $8.07) to pick up the package. Confused, I looked into it and the padded envelopes are ""express"" envelopes, while the boxes are regular priority. So I had put a Priority label on an Express envelope. My question is, is there any way to convince USPS to overlook this mistake? Buyer said she didn't pick up the package, and wants me to pay the entire amount so she can pick it up (and consider it a ""lesson learned"".) Who do I get in touch with (USPS) and how do I get in touch with them? I'm scared I have sent out a couple other envelopes as well.. I know it is a very stupid mistake. Where do I go from here?

about the ebay scam &amp; theft ring, I'm very parinoid about my order.

 So basically, I've been looking into getting an LG G2, and a few days ago I saw a listing for it for 380$ ""Buy it Now"" or Best Offer, and I was really disappointed in waiting too long and someone else bought it.

Ebay,"Seller listed item as ""new"" but added a disclaimer that her idea of ""new"" may differ from the buyer's...","I ordered some shoes that said ""New without box."" There was a whole rigamarole in which the seller sent the wrong pair, I returned them, and she caused a shipping snafu which delayed delivery (mail fraud to avoid return shipping costs). Kinda irritating.

Now I get the shoes, and they are clearly not new; the soles have clearly seen some nights out on the town. eBay describes new as: ""New without box: A brand-new, unused, and unworn item (including handmade items) that is not in original packaging or may be missing original packaging materials (such as the original box or bag). The original tags may not be attached. For example, new shoes (with absolutely no signs of wear) that are no longer in their original box fall into this category.""

I look at the description she wrote and it says: ""I list items as accurately as I can and my interpretation of ‘used’ can be completely different than yours as well as color.""

This, combined with the shipping snafu, makes me really want to leave her some negative feedback. I could request a partial refund, but I don't know if I feel like dealing with this anymore. The only bad feedback I have ever left is when you used to be able to leave it for buyers! So it's been a while.

Ebay,A question about USPS Package Services shipping.,"I bought an item a week ago that was advertised to ship free with expedited shipping. I got the tracking #, and saw that USPS said its postal type was ""package services"" which I have never had (usually it says something like priority or first class, and they all arrive by the ETA). The tracking shows that the package departed Jersey City, NJ sorting center (5 days ago), and the estimated delivery date was supposed to be 2 days ago, but I haven't received it yet in California. First, I wanted to check to make sure I am reading everything correctly: package services is NOT expedited, right? Should I bring this up with the seller? Also, is this common with USPS Package Services to not follow the ETA or update the tracking?

Ebay,New to eBay - Invoice,"Hi, 

Around three weeks ago, I posted a ""Buy It Now"" advertisement and a user clicked on ""Buy It Now"", but did not send any payments. His account was created on the day I posted the ad and he did not reply to any of my messages. Thus, I cancelled it and posted the ad again in an auction format. Since then, no one has made any bids. I ended it reposting it for another two times, totalling to one ""Buy It Now"" and three auctions.

Just a little over two days, eBay sent me an Invoice of $50. I am aware that eBay charges you for every listing posted, but I thought the first 50 per calender month was free. Even if it wasn't free, would it cost $12.50 (50/4) for every listing?

Ebay,Situation with Global Shipping Program and FedEx,"I'll admit I'm not 100% positive what all goes on in the Global Shipping Program process. We use UPS Ground for the majority of our items and do not ship outside of the US unless it's a small item that can go in a bubble envelope and be mailed via USPS.


eBay encouraged the use of the Global Shipping Program so we've tried it out. Overall we've had a lot of success. I know that once or twice we've had a buyer inform us that shipping charges were unfair and they were not told the cost of the additional charges until AFTER they made their purchase. And from what I understand we send it to a facility here within the US, and the buyer pays the additional charges to have the item sent from that facility to their country.


I am just trying to figure out what exactly has happened with this package we shipped the other week using the Global Shipping Program. And I'm also trying to figure out if it's even possible for us to have the package returned to us. I'll just show you the exchange between the buyer and I. The buyer is very understanding and knows that this is not our fault, but seems to think that the item will either become the property of the Mexican Government or we pay something like $60 to have it sent back to us. And even if that's the case - I have no idea how we contact FedEx to tell them we want it back.

**TL;DR** Buyer purchased a doll from us and lives in Mexico. We used the Global Shipping Program and had the doll shipped to the facility that we ship all GSP items to. The buyer contacted us to inform us that FedEx told her she will need to pay $35 to have it delivered but was not upset. We offered to pay for this for her since this is very unfair. FedEx contacts her again to say she needs a sanitary inspection letter and the item was marked as food/animal/inspect product. Buyer can either go through this hassle for a $10 Barbie doll or have it returned to us and we pay over $60.


Does anyone understand what might be happening here? Is there anything that can be done? We don't need a $10 doll returned to us, but it's very disappointing that our buyer can't have it without paying an extra $35 and a HUGE hassle.

Ebay,"TRS with potential Buyer issue for the first time -- any advice and, er, feedback would be greatly appreciated.","Hello All,

Constant browser, infrequent Reddit poster here.

I have been selling on eBay since 2002, and I have finally run into a potentially sticky situation with a Buyer. (I have been extremely fortunate until now, and even achieved TRS status as a hobbyist-type Seller; I have 367 feedback from Buyers, and all have been positive thus far.) This is the first issue I have ever had with a sale, and I was hoping I could solicit some, er, feedback about the situation. I'll try to keep it brief while denoting all the salient points.

I recently sold an original hand-sketched, framed piece by Jack Nicklaus for one of his golf clubs in Florida. It was purchased by a Buyer who appears to be a dealer/re-seller of sports memorabilia. (I have not provided a link here, as I do not fully understand the protocols of doing so relative to privacy, etc. -- I'd be happy to do so if it's allowed.)

Upon purchase, my review of the person's feedback left for other Sellers gave me great concern -- there have been 26 feedback comments left to Sellers, and 19 have been negative. I immediately anticipated trouble, and it appears that I now have some.

The item was shipped via UPS, and I let them prepare the packaging as well. It was delivered two days later, and I sent a customary follow-up message last Friday simply to ensure that it arrived safely. He only responded to my previous ""thank you for purchasing"" message by claiming his only concern was that the item was genuine and not a facsimile. I replied, and told him that were he to be unhappy with the purchase, for any reason, I would be happy to refund him the full amount upon return, and that I would even forward him the shipping funds required to return it via UPS in the manner I sent it (the shipping on this item was free).

I received a reply today that the item was ""not as advertised, and not worth what I paid for it"". The Buyer claims the sketch itself was described as measuring what the entire item measures, i.e., 11-1/2"" x 22"". I did not break out the individual measurements of the components of the piece, but it is a stretch (at best) to claim this was represented in my listing. (There are three components to the item -- a framed sketch at top, a photo of the hole on the course in the center, and a small plaque at the bottom.) I find the critique to be disingenuous. However, I will state here that no attempt for a reduced price or insinuation / threat of negative feedback was made.

I politely responded that, per my earlier email, I would happy to refund the purchase amount upon receipt of the returned item, as well as forward the return shipping charges. I have not received a response as yet. (I should note that my correspondence has all gone through eBay's messaging in the event it needs to be reviewed.)

A case has not been opened against me through either eBay or Paypal, nor has any feedback been left as of this writing. Based upon this Buyer's feedback history, I suspect a negative will be forthcoming.

I realize I may be jumping the gun a bit, but I want to ensure that I have not missed any proactive, protective moves here. I have read all the horror stories and understand that the Buyer almost universally has the upper hand in these situations, but my primary concerns are: 1) getting the item back; and, 2) attempting to protect myself from a negative, however futile that may ultimately be.

Please, fellow eBay Redditors, are there any other measures I can take here? I know I simply have to wait and see how this all unfolds, but I don't want to miss any steps, and this type of response has me suspicious of the Buyer's true motivations.

Ebay,Buyer refuses to use eBay's resolution center.,"I sold a CPU. Fully tested and working before I listed it. Now if the processor somehow did die on route to him I am willing to work with him. I want to use official eBay channels to sort this out but the buyer doesn't seem to want to use the tools available to him. From what I have read using the Resolution Center would provide both of us a little protection. If I just send out a refund like the buyer wants what is to say he is going to ship it back? What if he damaged the processor installing it? AMD pins are pretty easy to bend. This has been frustrating so far.  

Buyer
&gt; I received the processor promptly, thank you.  However, after trying to get it to work in two separate Gigabyte motherboards, that support the processor, updating the Bios on both boards and trying other troubleshooting options (pulling RAM, Cards, etc...) this processor does not even allow either MB to POST.  Indicating that it is not a working processor.  I am asking you to initiate a refund and I will ship it back within two days or on Thursday I will dispute the transaction with eBay and Paypal.  Please let me know what you plan to do.

Me
&gt; I am more than willing to work with you through the resolution center with eBay. http://resolutioncenter.ebay.com/ to start the process. 

Buyer
&gt; I just spoke with eBay AND PayPal's resolution center's.  Both indicated that most issues are resolved amicably between seller and buyer by the seller initialing a refund and the buyer returning the item, then PayPal will release the funds after you have received the CPU.  Should you not choose the easy path, PayPal and my bank will put a hold on your funds and this will go through the Resolution Process.  eBay, PayPal and I consider this a negative challenge and will take weeks to resolve and will most certainly result in Negative feedback as well as a ding on your account from both PayPal and eBay.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope we can take care of this quickly and in the future, others selling CPU's have posted a picture of the BIOS POSTing with the CPU clearly shown on the POST screen.

&gt; Like I said, I am more than willing to work with you through official channels. It is just a couple clicks for you, very easy to start. http://resolutioncenter.ebay.com/

&gt; Per eBay it will be through PayPals resolution center and it will be a formal process.  eBay encouraged me to reach out to you to self settle.  Am I to understand that you do not want to go the easy route that eBay recomends and I should pursue the formal PayPal chalenge?

Ebay,"What can I expect from a seller ""opening a case""?","So here's my situation: I bid on an item (Item A), and immediately after confirming was told I was outbid by someone else's max bid. I increased my max bid to what I was willing to pay, but was again told I was outbid. At that point, I stopped bidding and looked elsewhere for Item A.

In the description the seller clearly stated ""Do not bid on the item if you can't pay for it"". Totally reasonable request. In between the time I last bid and the time the auction closed, apparently the higher bidder retracted his/her bid, and mine suddenly became the high bid. I was not even thinking about Item A at this point, I had found a similar item (Item B) that I purchased with the money I was initially bidding with on Item A. 

I didn't see the email about my bid becoming the new high, and the auction ended with my high bid being the winner. I did not realize that if a higher bid was retracted, mine was still valid. The seller writes to me asking when I was going to pay, and I was actually taken a little aback because I was just totally not aware my bid had won. I explained that I didn't see my bid was the winner and that I no longer had the money to pay for it. 

He tells me he'll be opening a case with eBay, and I'm wondering what that means for me. I haven't bought much from eBay, so I know my buying record just goes against me at this point. I understand where the seller is coming from since he specifically said not to bid if you couldn't buy, I just don't have enough experience with eBay to have known that if a higher bid is retracted, mine is automatically still valid. I would have thought they'd ask me to reconfirm my bid if I wanted to since the high bid was now gone.

Ebay,Question for sellers from a buyer. What would you think would be reasonable in this case?,"I purchased a couple of pairs of higher end shoes from an ebay seller.  I've purchased items through them before and never had any problems.  They are a pretty large seller I think, their feedback score is over 350000.   They really push the angle that all their items are carefully inspected and described completely accurately and are properly cleaned.


Anyway onto the problem.  As mentioned I spent a few hundred dollars on a couple of pairs of used boots.  One was described as being nearly new.  One was described as being well used.  The well used ones are completely gorgeous I love them and have already left positive feedback.


The nearly new ones though which are listed as ""showing minimal wear"" are pretty dinged up.  The heel is peeling, there are several small holes in the sole that you can't see in the pictures.  But those can be fixed, my real problem is that I put them on without checking thoroughly inside and there was a used bandage that got stuck to my foot.  In addition to being just completely disgusted, when I say used this thing had some gross stuff happening, I'm allergic to the adhesive used in bandages so now I have a nice rash.  I definitely should have checked more before I put it on but I also think the seller should have found that before listing them.


My question!  What is reasonable to expect of the seller in this situation?  I don't want to return the boots, I can fix the tearing in the heels myself and resoling isn't that expensive when it needs to be done.  The zippers don't work either but I am hoping I can oil them and get them going.  But this bandage thing is just grossing me out.  I contacted the seller and haven't heard back.  I honestly would be happy with a sorry this happened message and would be completely thrilled with an offer to pay to have them cleaned but I'm not sure if that's unreasonable.


Or should I just leave negative feedback and move on?",2.0,3,2014-01-23,EBAY,0.09049615263938904,0.8696210384368896,0.0398828387260437

A week goes by and I tracked my dress and it is still in the initiated phase at her post office. I contacted her and she announces she had run out of delivery bags and couldn't post my dress.

What I'm looking for is one that can integrate with my eBay (like when i open the software my new orders are there waiting for me to print out a label), gives me great shipping discounts (most of my orders are small and can be shipped via USPS but I do have some larger items that might need to be shipped via UPS or FedEx) and eventually I want to open up a Amazon Seller Account and integrate that as well.

Any feedback would greatly help.

Thank you guys in advance!",8.0,2,2014-01-23,EBAY,0.01384870894253254,0.7810311317443848,0.20512011647224426
Ebay,I received a cabinet and it was completely broken.,"The packing on the cabinet was just terrible, it was made of thin wood and glass and the seller barely put 1 sheet of bubble wrap and about 10 packing peanuts. It's obvious that the damage was due to his packing. I took pictures right away, so am I looking to get my money back from him or from usps? The cabinet was a wall ornament so it's not a huge cabinet, it's for antiques.

**EDIT:** I paid $55, he refunded me $47.50 immediately, not happy, but I won't argue over ~$6.",14.0,2,2014-01-23,EBAY,0.09413475543260574,0.8580889701843262,0.04777628555893898

Ebay,I have sold a very high-value item. What is the best way to ship?,"I have sold an item over $2,000. It is still to be determined if the person has a verified PayPal address.

Frankly, With all the data breaches in the past couple of months I'm pretty skiddish, and the person has no buying history, but a eBay Membership for 1 year.

It's a brass instrument in a hard-shell case, so it's a little large. Is it best to go with Parcel Post with Delivery Verification/Signature Required, or Priority Mail with Delivery Verification/Signature Required?

Thanks for any and all help and suggestions you have to offer.

**Edit:** Taking into account all the information I've gathered and the feedback from this post I'm going to kill this deal. I'm not new to eBay, (though I buy 99% of the time,) so I was edgy as soon as I saw the bid.

Ebay,A word about Rule I. Please read.,"Hello /r/eBay,

Recently, the moderators have found an increase of abusive behavior towards others. Whether this is just an increase of awareness by the mods is up for debate... but irrelevant.

Rule I clearly states that you must be civil and objective with your posts and comments. There is absolutely ***no reason*** to treat others with disrespect through abusive comments. I am no saint myself, I swear all the time IRL but I find little use for people who treat others with blatant disrespect... especially in an anonymous environment such as this.

Keep in mind, this is a *friendly* subreddit where a majority of people come to get answers and advice from experienced users of eBay. If you want to gripe and moan about eBay, go to /r/eBaySucks... that is what it's there for. I will tell you that most of the negative and critical posts about eBay are not met with open arms from the readers of /r/eBay. I often see critical posts downvoted and the OP met with constructive resistance. 

By no means are we banning critical posts. I rarely remove posts that aren't spam or a violation of the sidebar rules... mostly Rule II.

With all that being said, any abusive behavior by anyone will be dealt with through an ***automatic and permanent ban.***

If you have any questions about this, please let me know.

Thanks, 

Lancaster1983

Ebay,"Buyer used BIN (instant payment), then messaged me requesting I ship to a different address (unconfirmed). Buyer is non-responsive to my messages and denied my item cancellation request.","Apologies for another thread on such a common occurrence! (buyer requesting an item shipped to a different address)

So, here's a breakdown of what I'm currently experiencing, whilst attempting to stick with my 48-hour shipment schedule:


**Wednesday**

* Buyer used Buy-it-Now on one of my auctions.

* Instant payment from buyer was received.

* Through eBay messaging, the buyer later stated that they have moved and requested that I ship the item to a new address.

* I followed up expressing my reluctance, stating that it was against eBay policy and that it also denies me from Seller ""Protection."" I suggested cancelling the sale, issuing a refund, and re-listing the item so they could complete checkout again *with an updated address*.

* No response at the end of the day.

* I opened up a claim selecting the ""Buyer requested shipment to an unconfirmed address"" option. 


**Thursday**

* Buyer finally shows activity - denies my cancellation request and comments, ""if you really want to ship to my old address go for it.""

* Buyer did not reply to my initial message, which covered the issue in detail.

* In my state of bewilderment over the matter, I contacted eBay customer support (twice).

* First rep said that I should ship to the buyer's new address. I questioned if this was even recommended as per eBay / PayPal policy. Rep said he'd call back with definitive answer. 4 hours later and no returned call.

* Called customer support again. Rep noticed the buyer declined cancellation request and shared uncertainty over the ""if you really want to ship to my old address go for it"" comment from buyer. Rep asked if I felt ""comfortable"" shipping to buyer's requested address, stating that they had record of this request in the event of a claim. Then the rep transferred me to a PayPal rep over the address issue. PayPal rep was not helpful at all, stating that the buyer must change the address for me to be eligible for Seller Protection (d'uh!).

* In light of cs rep phone tag, I messaged the buyer telling him the whole story, explaining that I was apologizing the delay in shipping and drama for what seems to be such a small issue. I asked for cooperation with updating address on PayPal. (Then again, I'm sitting here thinking how such a change would effect a transaction that has already processed.)


**Friday** (now)

I'm sitting here typing this and anxiously awaiting a response from the buyer. I'm nervous that this is just a case of a casual eBay user who thinks I'm throwing them through hoops to ship an item they have already paid for!

I'm really tempted to pull the trigger and ship the item to the buyer's post-checkout address.

The buyer has a clean feedback profile, but I see that they haven't had any activity in 7 months. I'm just getting really anxious because my 48-hour shipping window is nearly here and the buyer is not offering much communication. Also, I don't want to be screwed over and lose Seller Protection in the event of a forthcoming scam.

Any insight or comments are much appreciated. Thank you for your time, r/ebay! :)

- - - - -

**EDIT** I went ahead and shipped the item today. To the buyer's ""new"" address.

After talking with another CS team member (buyer and seller protection), we concluded that it was safe to ship to the buyer's unconfirmed address. Since there was record of the buyer's request in the eBay message center, the change of address was noted/approved and would not -- ahem, *screw me over*, in the event of a potential Item Not Received case.

Ebay,How do I get people to stop not paying for a buy-it-now sale? It's happened twice so far on the same item.,"So, I'm trying to sell my HDV camcorder for a very reasonable price, my buy-it-now is about $300 less than the next listed item. So far, it's been ""bought"" 3 times at the buy it now price, but two people haven't paid. The first simply never contacted me, never responded to my invoice and never paid. I opened an unpaid item case, and it closed, so I got my 10% fee refunded. Immediately after closing the case, I relisted, and about an hour later, again it was ""bought"" through the buy-it-now. Only this seller had 0 feedback and wanted me to invoice through paypal using my email. This sounded suspicious, so I just invoiced through eBay, and haven't heard anything since, still unpaid. I've opened another unpaid item case, but it can't close until 6 days after the item hasn't been paid for. 

However, i can re-list the item, so I did. And lo-and-behold, within the hour, another ""buyer"", this time with a feedback score in the 200's, all positive. However, it's been about 5 hours, and they haven't paid yet, though I've sent them an invoice. 

What's the normal protocol on how long a buyer usually takes to pay? And, is there a way I can get people to stop not paying for my item?

Sorry about the long post.

Ebay,How do you bounce back from a bad rating?,"Earlier this month I tried selling some DVDs. Something had happened with my paypal and I couldn't access it and had to go through a big security process and I never ended up receiving payment or addresses to ship to. I apologized and tried to work with my buyers, one was very nice about it, the gave me a negative rating saying she never received her DVDs, but I also never got payment or an address either.

Should I just open a new account?",2.0,3,2014-01-24,EBAY,0.7451027631759644,0.23771405220031738,0.017183242365717888
Ebay,"eBay and their dodgy ""Trust and security system""","I've been an avid eBay seller for years. Since I was a kid, I'd always research opportunities to buy and sell. It was when I was in my early teens I found a great opportunity. I've since gained thousands of feedback and from then it went downhill. Account after account limited for absolutely no reason. I'd bet that it was because of my sudden high volume. All I remember is that I had a few scammers charge back claiming that they had not received their item, even though it was sent. Why would I ruin my great business for a $15 item? Even when I sent registered, people still charged back saying it never arrived! I was a recreational seller until I started selling at a high volume. (Let me inform you that the accounts were all under my fathers name and was being held accountable for everything, nothing was under my name so it was legal). I was demanded to show proof of purchase and postage, did so. In fact I have hundreds of postage receipts, order invoices and various other documents. Let me remind you that the items were legal to sell. Still had little to no communication except for ""We've reviewed your files and you're still limited"". I even resorted to having an ombudsman investigate and still had no luck.

This was two years ago. Now, my mother uses eBay with a completely new eBay and her own PayPal account and today she got her account limited and eBay selling rights revoked. After calling up countless times, they tell her that ""she needs to resolve her problems with 'HER' other account"" (mine from two years ago), which isn't even hers, it was mine (under my fathers name). How could they have associated her with my account? Our ISP  and our IP probably had changed at least 20 times by then.

Does this mean that if a company had 100 employees and one of them scammed on the companys IP, that every employee would have their account revoked?

I think this is absurd. I've moved on from eBay now and don't think I'll ever have an opportunity to sell again. Their ""Trust and security"" system is infested by a bunch of robotic employees regurgitating what their manager has instructed them to say. They simply won't budge or accept your reasoning.

Anyone else had a similar experience?",1.0,2,2014-01-24,EBAY,0.054718296974897385,0.9193152189254761,0.025966443121433258
Ebay,I need to vent about some sellers with multiple accounts,"I understand those who use ebay as a place to make income. But  Im extremely fed up with sellers who have multiple or stealth accounts to sell fake/ counterfeit items.

I am ranting because Ive  reported these accounts to ebay and nothing has be done. The seller is selling fake purses on ebay from Ioffer. She or he buys them from ioffer for $400 and sells them on ebay for more than 1000-2000. They claim the item is authentic and they have a ""fake"" receipt  from  barneys. You see from the listing below that the receipts are the same. Also the accounts share feedback and purchase from each other which I have also informed ebay.

Ebay,The rules of /r/eBay. Please Read.,"###The following is information regarding the rules of /r/eBay and what they mean.
***
**I. Be civil, respectful and objective with your posts.** 

* This is not /r/eBaySucks. If you have a rant, go there instead.
* You will not use this venue to post information about poor buyers or sellers. Isolating a single user accomplishes next to nothing and is deemed unnecessary here.
* The blatant use of foul language is prohibited.
* ***The abusive treatment of others will result in a [immediate and permanent ban](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/1vwvud/a_word_about_rule_i_please_read/)***.

**II. Posting links to eBay directly is forbidden.** 

* This is not an auction platform. Your auction will get plenty of views from the eBay site alone.
* The sidebar contains several related subreddits which cater to buying, selling and trading on eBay, which is not self-promotion.
* If you have a question or see an interesting auction, post screenshots.
* The AutoModerator will remove any eBay links immediately.
* The reddit-wide rules forbid using the site for free advertising or spam. 

**III. Block out all personal or private information.** 

* If you are posting a screenshot, block out all personal identifiable information including (real names, street addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc...). 
* If it appears that you are [Doxxing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing) someone, you will be banned immediately and reported to the reddit admins.
* eBay usernames are public information but posting a link to a eBay user's profile for revenge is not permitted.

**IV. No SPAM.** 

* You will be banned if you have a history of posting nonsense or SPAM. This includes self-promotion or solicitation of any personally owned blog, VBlog or similar social media venue. 
* Posts from newly created accounts will be removed automatically. This discourages SPAM and the use of throwaway accounts. 
* Do not solicit others to sell items for you. This is a known scam and you will be banned.
* Posts from YouTube, Facebook, Google+ and similar social media sites will be removed as they often contain SPAM. This is also to keep things clean in the comments and posts.
* If you are actually new to reddit and posting for the first time here (without violating the rules), [let us know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEbay) after you post so we can approve it.

**V. Keep posts relevant to eBay.**

* Posts that are not relevant to eBay Inc or any of its [subsidiaries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_eBay) (PayPal, Bill Me Later, Half.com, StubHub, etc...) will be removed. 

##Repeated violations of any of these rules may result in a ban.

###Reporting Posts:

When a post is reported, /u/AutoModerator has been set to notify the moderators immediately to review the report. We still request that you message the mods yourself but if you wish to remain anonymous, we understand.

Keep in mind that we can't be on reddit at all times so some reports may go unnoticed for a period of time (mostly overnight). Rest assured that you will not be ignored.

This subreddit has been relatively maintenance free but as the population grows, more and more violations are being reported. The moderators here appreciate your help whenever a post gets flagged for removal.

###This is a discussion based subreddit and efforts to keep it clean include the automatic removal of certain domains. 

###These rules are not terribly strict and are pretty standard across reddit. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

Ebay,Thank you everyone on /r/ebay!,"Hello. I posted before that I bought getting a broken PS3 and how the seller didn't want to issue a refund. Everyone here helped me a ton (apart from one guy who was *violently* angry with me in personal messages for some reason - I guess he was mad that he had to refund me ;)) and I posted the broken POS back yesterday. eBay sided with me because people don't write their listings properly and it's not the buyer's responsibility to email the seller asking about the item. All the information needed should be on the sale page! Grr.

So thanks everyone! Much love to you~",5.0,9,2014-01-26,EBAY,0.12175897508859634,0.8197723031044006,0.05846868082880974
Ebay,"I'm PISSED right now. Buyer left NEG feedback for me, without contacting me or anything.","i Had 241 feedback so far 100% perfect till today.


Buyer has left 3 negative feedbacks in the last week for multiple sellers.

I shipped him a 5.00!!! item on the 14th of this month. He neg feed backed me today ""ITEM NOT RECEIVED"" How the heck am I supposed to know that he didn't get it?

My auctions all clearly state, 100% Satisfaction Guarantee, Please contact me if you have any issues.

I'm so upset right now. 

is there anything I can do? I've already messaged the buyer, telling him I'm sorry he didn't get his item that I shipped out on the 14th.  I also said I'd be glad to ship him a replacement or refund him, but I'd like him to also revise his feedback.

Ebay,Ebay listing issue - postage related (Australian),"Hi there. Just thought I'd relay an issue that occurred today. I suppose it's a bit of a whinge, and a complaint, and might only be relevant to ebay.com.au - not sure. 

A couple of days ago I had a potential bidder ask about the postage costs listed on a listing. $20 for a double-dvd sent by registered postage. Yes the amount is high, but that's how I do things, and I'm allowed to. Essentially I want to sell the item for $40 including delivery (which costs me around $8) and so I list it for $20 + $20. Anyhow I told the potential bidder that no I won't reduce the postage price. 

Low and behold I get an ebay message from ebay with the title ""MC018 Listing policy violation alert: Confusing or Misleading Title""

I won't list the title here, but there's nothing wrong with the title AT ALL. 

The ebay message goes on to say that ""Postage indicates: ""AU $20.00 Standard Postage"", however, the description says the item will be sent by registered postage.

Now this is true. The item description does say Standard Postage - and it says this because of ebay - I have no control over what is said there - to be clear, I'm referring to the top section of the item description listing (not in the revise / edit section). 

Now in the revise / edit section, in the postage section I have the following selected...

Flat: same cost to all buyers

Australia Post Regular Parcel Registered (1 to 6 business days)

So, to be clear, as far as I understand, I have selected the appropriate postage options (Registered) and I do not have any option to select ""Standard"" as the ebay message refers to. 

The ebay message also has another inconsistency where it says that the listing hasn't been removed, and then it goes on to say that it has been removed. In actuality it hasn't been removed. I'm just making the point here that the policy violation report is utterly incorrect (nothing wrong with the title AT ALL, and they're not clear about the reasonings, and they're contradicting themselves about whether or not the listing has been removed. It's poor communication right from the word go. 

The ebay message ends by suggesting to contact ebay customer support. So I do. I contact Live Chat. Completely hopeless. They tell me to click reply on the ebay message. Oh that's helpful. So I do that. (still haven't received a response from the email I sent by the way). 

But then I call ebay as well. 

I spoke with a nice lady (from the Philippines I believe) who had good English. I explained the issue to her, and I told her that I believe that I've chosen all correct options, and that the issue is not an issue with the listing, but an issue with ebays system - i.e. if i'm choosing the correct delivery option (registered) it is not my fault that the listing is showing the incorrect delivery option (standard postage) when I have no control over that. 

She put me on hold and spoke with the trust and safety team. 

She came back to me and said that I don't have to fix the issue, but if I don't I will get into trouble. She said that I would need to select calculated postage and not flat rate for all. Which is not a solution. I should not be forced (or threatened) to choose an incorrect and inconvenient option just because their system isn't working correctly. 

I got frustrated and explained as best I could what the situation is, as I have explained above. Of course at first I was spoken to as if I'm an idiot, but by the end she agreed that it appears that I'm 100% right and that she'll ask the trust and safety team to look into it further. 

I pointed out that all of the listings across multiple ebay accounts have this exact same ""issue"" and that it is in no way unique to this particular listing or indeed account - and that it is a part of the ebay system of which I have no control. 

Of course I currently have no resolution, but have been told that I will hear from them tomorrow. 

Whatever the outcome this is quite disappointing. 

Unless I'm missing something, it seems that the initial message from ebay is riddled with mistakes; that Live Chat palmed me off unnecessarily and incorrectly; that the customer service rep that I spoke with gave me incorrect information and incorrect advice which was provided to her by the trust and safety team that specialise with these issues. 

Why am I being given the wrong information when I'm fundamentally explaining the situation for them and handing it to them on a plate. Why do I have to do other peoples jobs for them and then they still manage to screw it up. Why do the staff across these various departments seem to have such a lack of knowledge of their own systems. Why hasn't anyone identified this ""issue"" before. Why is my listing being singled out? Well I partially know the answer to that, and the guy that asked the question has been blocked

EDIT/UPDATE:- Received an email from Ebay - they said they called but couldn't get through and that they may have a problem making outbound calls. Didn't they used to own Skype? 

Anyhow, they said that I was 100% right and they apologised for being 100% wrong. 

So what do we learn from this? Well we can be thankful that they did recognise that they were wrong (once they were told very clearly exactly how they were) but we can be disappointed that they essentially go about their day giving out wrong information and not understanding their own systems. 

IMO they've embarrassed themselves on this one. So if you need evidence of ineptitude, look no further.",4.0,6,2014-01-26,EBAY,0.22650836408138275,0.7348556816577911,0.03863594029098749

Ebay,Suspicious user activity - opinions?,"I'm currently dealing with a somewhat suspicious user and I wanted other people's opinions.  I'm selling a motherboard on ebay at an 'average' price.  

I recently got a bid by a new user who just registered 1-24-2014 ie a day ago.  He has 0 ratings.  His name is bobbbrvrds105mc.  He put a bid on my motherboard and then messaged me saying it was a mistake and wanted to cancel his bid, so i cancelled his bid and sent him a message saying I cancelled it for him.  He then sent me 3 more messages all of which said that he decided he did want to bid on it, and that he really wanted it and he's on poor man's disability yadda yadda, and he would just buy a new computer but its too expensive and that his motherboard had died and he just wants this instead (even though there are others that are same model currently up for cheaper).  So now he re-bid on it.  Now any one of these alone (new user, random character name, sob story) wouldn't really rouse my suspicion too much, but all 3 of them at the same time really sets off my scam alarm.  I've been on the internet since the 90s and all 3 of these things i've associated with scammers and spammers.  I see it all quite often on other platforms.

Edit: Thanks everyone! I ended up calling ebay and they looked it over and sided with me. There was enough evidence of him trying to use feedback extortion throughout the messages we exchanged. They told me not to give him a partial refund and if he ends up giving me negative feedback to call them back and they will remove it.
In the begging of the messages, I told him that if he was unhappy with the item, to open up a buyer protection case so he could return the item and I could refund him his money back. But he did not want to do this and instead he stated he wanted a partial refund. Ebay said I took the right action in telling him to open up a case.

Ebay,Global Tracking Numbers,"This number is completely worthless to me.

I ordered an item last week, it was located in the US and I am in Canada.  After my checkout it gave me global tracking number which doesn't seem to have much use other than giving me a 17 day window my item will be delivered in.

Is there anyway to find the tracking number for the next leg of this trip?

Ebay,I (buyer) returned an incorrect item and am now down the original cost and the postage. eBay denied my appeal yet I'm sure they're wrong. Any help greatly appreciated.,"I wondered if any eBay experts might be able to give me some advice, please. I'll try and summarise, but my brain is fried right now so apologies if it's not clear. I'm in the UK, by the way - that's probably relevant somewhere. Also, I know that £17.80 is not much money at all to a lot of people, but to me it really is and also there's the principle of things.

I'm the buyer, and in December 2013 the seller sent the wrong item to me. The seller suggested I return the incorrect item for a refund of original costs plus postage which seemed reasonable, so I posted it back. The seller then began to ignore my messages. As it was approaching the end of the timescale for the case, I had no choice but to escalate it to customer support. They have looked into it and chosen not to refund me. I appealed and they upheld their decision.

I was pretty skint at the time I posted it back and so could not afford to send it via recorded delivery, only first class normal mail. I knew it was risky but didn't realise it would cause me to be out-of-pocket by the original cost and also the postage cost. Having checked the eBayUK 'money back guarantee' it says that using a recorded delivery service for returns is only 'recommended' and not compulsory.

I'm really peeved though that they've not addressed the fact that the seller ceased all communication with me. I asked customer support about that and they've implied (or perhaps I've just inferred) that the seller has not spoken to them, either.

I'd really appreciate some help with this, if anyone could. I've painstakingly copied all correspondance relating to this case into a pdf so can upload that somewhere for your perusal (all names and identifying information have been removed).

All I will ask is that you please be gentle with me because for some reason this whole case has left me in floods of tears for the last couple of days (and sleepless nights). I know it's only £17.80. Guess I'm strangely fragile at the moment. It sucks.

I've closed the case which should result in me getting the fee reimbursed. However, it still has the transaction listed under ""sold"" and it still says the amount under payments not received.

Ebay,10 listings removed for false policy violation,"This morning 10 of my listings were removed for violating ebay policies. They were medical sutures, according to ebay they were removed because they need a prescription; they don't. Called ebay and was transferred to people who handle the removals because the first person wasn't sure why they were removed. Spoke to another person (broken english) for about 30 minutes, she said prescription again then after telling her not needed she went on about how it could cause death...etc. Then she searched some database and could not find the sutures on the not allowed items list and again said not allowed because it requires a prescription.

Ebay,Calculating a gross profit (after taxes) and if it's worth forming an Sole proprietorship / LLC [xpost /r/Flipping],"x-posting from /r/flipping as I believe the sellers on here may have more relevant experience:

I've been having a hard time trying to estimate my gross profit for a theoretical income, which has also brought up the question of if I should be forming a Sole-Proprietorship / LLC if I plan on having this become a $20k+ side job and eventually an independent full-time job.

I currently work a full-time job w/ benefits making around $30k per year (~$20k take home). In addition, my goal for this year is to make $20k gross profit from selling on eBay, Craigslist, etc. Let's say, hypothetically, that my sales will be around $60k, and my expenses will be:

* Cost of goods sold (what buying items for sale cost) = $30k and
* Business expenses (fees, shipping, office equipment, car expenses)  = $10k

So I will have 20k gross profit, but what can I expect my after-taxes (take home) profit be? Would my case warrant sole proprietorship? How do deductions for business expenses come in to play?",2.0,5,2014-01-29,EBAY,0.06104300543665886,0.9090961217880249,0.029860898852348328

Ebay,Question from an impatient seller...,"Hey folks-- 

This is going to be a really random question, but does anybody have a suggestion how to sell products faster? I have a lot of very obscure items up for auction, and I keep adding to the list, but I'm not selling nearly as many as I'm listing. I'm not selling this stuff only to make money--- More to make space in my apartment and, to use a word I invented, ""Decrapify."" -- I started going through drawers and realized how much unused and unnecessary stuff I have, and that's space I want to reclaim. I'm just getting impatient. 

I slashed the prices as low as I can, and took into account how much some of this stuff has sold for in the past and all that. I'm just looking to increase exposure, I guess. I did post a link on Redditbay, so I figured that was a start...

Ebay,Just some General Questions About Making My eBay Business at Home a Full-time Job,"Hello all, at the moment I have a full time job and then I have my eBay business on the side. This past year (my first year in business) my eBay business grossed $7,000 profit. I know this doesn't sound like a lot however I really do not care about the small amount of money I grossed. To my eyes any additional money is more money than I previously had.

When I started this business a year ago I only had the funds to be an extremely small business so at the moment I only carry about 8 different brands of one type of item (I know I'm being very vague, don't feel comfortable talking about what I sell), when there are about 40-50 different kinds of brands I could be selling. Now that I have the funds, it would be very possible to expand, and I'm wondering if you guys could assist me. Even though I do love my day job more than most people, I still feel as if I would enjoy life to the fullest if I could be the boss man and not have to worry about anyone else. I would love if I didn't have to leave the house to work (I'm very introverted). Do you guys think I would be able to make at least $35,000/year with a home based eBay business? That's really all that I would like to achieve at this point in time. I'm 24 years old.

Just some questions for you all:

* Does owning your own business hurt your resume? I'm asking because what if I decided down the road that I wanted to get a job elsewhere?
* Do you have any employees?
* Do you work from home?",14.0,3,2014-01-29,EBAY,0.02792121097445488,0.9223368167877197,0.04974203184247017
Ebay,"Mailed a possibly insufficiently funded package to buyer through USPS, what is going to happen now?","I screwed up weighing my package with USPS Click n Ship, and there is a good chance that the package I mailed is underpaid by a few dollars. I printed a label for a 2lb package, but it is possible that the package is above 2lb (very unlikely to be over 3lb). The package is now on its way to the buyer.

I'm getting conflicted information about what happens with a situation like this. The post office told me that the receiver will pay the extra, some people on the internet said it would just charge me thorugh my USPS online account (which makes the most sense to me). I need to know what is going to happen, because if it is true that my buyer will have to pay the mailman, I need to notify her beforehand.

Ebay,small PSA for sellers and report a buyer function,"TL;DR - I thought the report a buyer function was pretty decent until today but it turns out it is more or less completely useless.

I have seen a few posts lately about people commending ebay for banning users who had scammed them in the past and notifying them. I have had this happen to me also and thought it was pretty good. However it doesn't actually make any difference as this program only blocks an ebay user ID and nothing else as the story will show.

Here is what happened:

Aug 6th - Scam buyer claims a steel chain he bought off me has snapped (borderline impossible given the strength and huge thickness of the steel it's probably unbreakable by human hands or even a car driving over it). Threatens negative feedback for a replacement, I think nothing of it and report him, he is banned some time in November.

Jan 31st - Buyer buys the exact same chain in a different colour, gives me a negative(which was an attempt to extort a refund out of me, in exchange for feedback removal, he had done this to 4 other sellers at the same time fwiw).
Thankfully I have a fairly photographic memory so I put his name into my email, turns out it is the same guy from Aug 6th under a different house address. Same full name, same paypal email.

I got the feedback removed under some other technicality which I won't go into, but either way ebay isn't banning POS scammers, they just get their user ID banned and then are able to use the same paypal once again. They don't even have to make any real effort to get back on, if this guy had a brain he could be in an endless cycle and he could easily scam people non stop.",5.0,6,2014-01-31,EBAY,0.15069518983364105,0.8292535543441772,0.020051192492246628
