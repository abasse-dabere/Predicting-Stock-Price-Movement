Ebay,Buyer returned different items and wants a refund. Advice please.,"A friend sold a Logitech lot - a nice mouse, usb cords, multiple batteries, etc. He cleaned up everything super nice - it looked new even though it was used. It was in working condition; he retested everything just before listing it. 

The buyer claims the mouse was broken and wants a full refund. My friend approved the return and provided a label through eBay. The buyer had it professionally packed (Will that be charged to the prepaid label?) 

The mouse is covered in scuffs/residue - not there before. Not sure if it's the same one. They only had it for a day or two. 

The batteries are NOT the ones that were sent... the ones sent had sharpie dates written on them in my friend's handwriting. The batteries also had 3 factory embossed logo icons across the top. None of the batteries that were returned are the original ones sent - there's no writing or embossed logos. (You can clearly see both in the pictures.)

He hasn't tested it yet, but I'm sure it doesn't work because it isn't his. 

I know eBay always sides with the buyer. I'm a clothing seller and haven't had to deal with many returns due to 'items not working.' So I'm not sure how to help him out. What are his options? Should he message the buyer or just escalate to eBay? Will eBay side with the buyer even though the items are clearly different? Does he have to give a refund? 

UPDATE: We have contacted eBay over the phone. They said to contact the buyer, then escalate the case. We questioned the batteries to the buyer asking why they're different than the ones sent. In poor English, the buyer said they 'sent back *better batteries* than received and lost the original packaging with the original batteries. The batteries aren't the issue - the broken mouse is.' He also admitted to already owning the same mouse. 

**FINAL UPDATE:** Thanks for all your help and replies. Side note, we realized the receiver isn't ours after really inspecting it and comparing it pictures. It has smokers residue on it and some other flaws. That's why the mouse suddenly doesn't work - because they switched out receivers. We escalated the case to eBay, they immediately sided with the buyer since the item doesn't work and we received the return package. My friend immediately called and appealed the case unemotionally, with all the facts. **HE WON.** woohoo! eBay is refunding him - the seller - with money out of their own pocket. He's going to attempt to sell the return (the buyer's stuff) for parts and repair. The buyer got the parts he needed to fix his non-working mouse for free...",12.0,9,2015-07-01,EBAY,0.07549239695072174,0.888156533241272,0.03635108098387718
Ebay,"Powerseller for 11 years, shutting down my eBay store, here's my 4 page letter to the president of eBay.","To anyone wanting to start selling on eBay, or an insight into my issues over the years as a powerseller, you may want to read this letter I wrote today to the Office of the President at eBay. If I get a response from them, I will post it here as well, but that may be a while as you can only mail letters to give eBay its own feedback (ironic I know)
Here it is:

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this as a longtime ebay powerseller (selling up to $80k/month), huge fan and promoter of eBay, and I trust that this will be read by the highest decision makers at eBay. Ebay is built on feedback, so as a customer for over 14 years, I would like to leave my feedback to you. 
 
First, my name is ________, and my eBay store is _______. I really got started on eBay in 2004, when I worked at a guitar store in Canada, and started selling their old inventory. When I sold out of most of the stock within a few months, I approached the owner about getting more to sell, but he was just happy to get rid of dead inventory that had been sitting around for years. I decided right then to go into business, did my first order from overseas, and quit my job 2 months later. In my first year alone, I quadrupled my income that I made at the music store, and my second year of business, I netted over $160K from selling on ebay alone. eBay has been an amazing journey for me, as it has allowed me to be self employed for more than the last 12 years. I’ve traveled to many amazing places around the world (Thailand, Europe, Caribbean, Mexico (dozens of times) throughout the USA and Canada) all because of the freedom and income that selling on eBay gave me. 
Since my start, the business has changed a lot, there used to be maybe 10 sellers doing what I did, now there are hundreds. I have no problem with that, as the eBay buyers have also increased 10x or more. I have tried many new products over the years, from bellydance outfits to wristbands to pillow covers, to dropshipping from other sellers. I’ve had great success with some, and others, not so much.

In case you missed it, what I’m saying is, “I LOVE EBAY!” 

Which is why I’m very saddened to say that I am leaving eBay for good. We are still very much in business, we now sell primarily on Amazon and through our own website, and are thriving. I feel eBay is no longer a reliable sales channel for businesses (more on this below)

I am writing this because I am deeply saddened and concerned by what eBay has become recently. I am one of the many large powersellers who has decided to leave eBay, and I doubt many give a true answer as to the reasons why they chose to leave, so let me be one to explain in detail the issues that led us to leave, because I really do care, and want to see change at eBay. I don’t know who is making decisions at eBay, but they are making some HUGE mistakes. Ebay isn’t even viable anymore as one of our selling channels, as we simply can’t rely on you. 

Most importantly, eBay has lost touch with it’s sellers. It has become so focused on a positive, bulletproof buyer experience that it’s forgotten and disillusioned it’s sellers. We are small business owners who employ tens of thousands of people across the USA (and many more worldwide) I’ve followed many large sellers over the years, dissecting what they do, what they sell, and how much they make. It always shocked me to see so many of the largest top rated sellers just disappear. I even contacted a few to find out what happened, some moved on to other ventures, but the overwhelming problem was issues with eBay. I thought that could never happen to me, yet here I am today, liquidating all of our eBay product and closing our store (at least until change happens)

No, I’m not going to complain about high fees. The fees have never been an issue for me, as I feel the cost per sale is actually decent, and is a good value for the traffic that eBay items get. I don’t believe there is much or any room to increase fees, but the value is there.


Here are the unresolved problems we had with ebay over the years.

1.	Selling Manager Pro doesn’t work properly. 
a.	Selling manager pro constantly relists items that are not in stock, (yes I made sure automation rules were set properly) this has not been fixed up until the time of me writing this, and I find these monthly. I’ve called tech support regarding this several times over the years, and have since given up, because the service was always the same, a polite, well trained staff member, who had never heard of the problem before, who then took my information, and promised I was going to be taken care of and have the issue resolved. (And of course never heard from again). 
b.	This has directly contributed to us losing tens of thousands of dollars over the years due to lost TRS discount, lost sales due to Best Match limitation, funds being held, and even selling limits. 

2.	Non-paying bidder claims were set to automatically be filed, yet hundreds (probably thousands) of these did not auto-file, costing us thousands in eBay fees. Again, tech support was called, they identified there was a problem, I was promised to have this looked into and refunded if that was the case, yet was never contacted again on this issue.
3.	Other limits: 
i.	As a (previous) fan of eBay, I have many friends who see my lifestyle and want to know how I did this. A few months ago, I helped a friend get his eBay page started. He came over to my house, I helped him upload a few items he was selling. I used an HTML template I had for the item description, changed a few things, and forgot my email address was used as the paypal payment method, so this was uploaded to his eBay page. He sold some things, then lost interest or something, and had to refund some items because the items weren’t in stock. He was dropshipping items, and had too many cancelled (which he refunded the customers) and eBay ended up shutting him down completely. Because of this, Ebay then decided to limit my wifes selling account, because that email address was used on 3 listings on his site before we caught the mistake. The moral of this is, “Don’t help your friends sell on eBay, you could get completely shut down if they make a mistake and you are associated with their account in any way.”

4.	And the #1 BIGGEST problem we have with eBay, the breaking point, that is completely unnacceptable:

a.	Selling Limitations. 
i.	We have always taken pride in our customer service. I was professional trained in customer service at a major sporting goods retailer when I was a teenager, and good service was ingrained in me at a young age. We’ve always taken care of our customers excellently. We have never been involved in anything remotely unethical or shady in any way, and have never once frauded a customer in any way.
ii.	Last month, our account that sold up to $80k/month a year ago, was limited to selling $7k this month. The reason? We are able to ship international items very cheaply through a business USPS service called IPA. Our customers love it because we can ship globally, and although they don’t get a tracking number (most international shipment aren’t trackable anyway) they can receive items for a very reasonable shipping cost. Ebay decided that this isn’t good enough, that we have to include tracking numbers with our international shipments, and of course never made this known to us. (yes it’s probably written in some 47 page seller agreement somewhere) Some international buyers did not receive their items (which are 100% covered in the event of being lost, we refund or replace every time without question) These buyers filed claims, and eBay dropped our selling limits down to less than 10% of what they used to be. I don’t need to tell you the devastating effect this will have on your business when you have employees, a warehouse, expenses etc. 

To sum up everything, no business is safe selling on eBay as it’s sole sales channel. If life happens, like a postal strike (yes we were limited from one of these years ago as well) a family illness, a bad employee, a hacker, etc etc, eBay can and will devastate you and your business, and nothing can be said to change any of it. It doesn’t matter that we’ve spent approx $400K in ebay fees, and have 14 years of selling history, you can still be limited. I’ve lived in the USA for four years, I can walk into any bank in America and get a loan for $1 million dollars, but eBay does not trust me enough after 14 years to sell unrestricted on their website. That is so far beyond acceptable, eBay has no concern for it’s long term business sellers. 
To anyone who wants to get into selling on eBay, my recommendation has changed from “absolutely, let me know if you need any help!” to “I can’t recommend it. If you make any mistakes, eBay will destroy you, start on Amazon FBA” If you are starting out with an eBay business, you will not be afforded the opportunity to learn from your mistakes. You will not be allowed to make mistakes, you will be shut down or limited long before you can ever grow, which now will take years (I think you can sell 10 things your first month?) You will not be allowed to have your customers tell you what they want in terms of shipping methods, payment methods etc, eBay will dictate that to you. Don’t ever be a day late with shipping, not responding to an email on time, or canceling an item that selling manager pro mistakenly sells that you do not have, you will be limited or shut down. Don’t even THINK of starting a drop shipping or brand name clothing business. Don’t ever take a day off and ship your items the following day, eBay will limit you. 

I will be sharing this letter on various social media sites as well. I think it is very important for future eBay sellers and businesses to know what they are getting into.

Is there anything I can do from here? Strangely the buyer has a 100% seller rating and 129 transactions. Is there any way the chargeback could have been an accident?

Edit: Called eBay, they couldn't even see the chargeback and referred me to PayPal. They saw the chargeback and forwarded the proof  of purchase to the buyers credit card company, reported the buyer, and refunded me the $20 chargeback fee.

Ebay,Am I being scammed? And what do I do about it?,"I've been an off and on seller on eBay for several years now so I've had my fair-share of smooth transactions and ridiculous buyers. This one takes the cake for me.

The past couple of months I sold quite a few items. I had a solid ritual for packaging items after they sold, scheduling pick-ups from USPS. I was meticulous about packaging and making sure the right item goes to the right buyer. 

The lot in question contained several books by a well-known author. Some newer and in good shape, others older and a little worn. I received a refund request because this buyer claimed they didn't receive the lot as described. In fact they claimed they didn't get ANY of the books I listed. They posted pictures of what they claimed to receive which looked like a bunch of old science or college textbooks (think older editions that bookstores won't even buy back).

It seems really absurd that someone would scam for such a small amount of money (~$40) but who knows. The pictures make it seem like they opened the box I sent and all these random books were inside. Here's the thing though. They received this package (verified through USPS tracking) two weeks ago and they're only now just opening it and filing this claim?

I've heard people do this when they try to re-sell and can't get the money they want for an item. 

What I think happened is they received my books, took them out, put in these random books they had, and took photos to make it seem like that's what I sent.

In a couple days eBay will be able to step in but I know how they like to side with buyers over sellers. I've been selling for a long time and I have a good reputation on there and yeah it's a minor amount of money but I've never had to deal with this before and it is highly suspicious.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.


UPDATE: So the buyer responded and said that the reason they didn't get to the package until recently was that they had many eBay purchases they let stack up and just now got around to opening them. They also indicated one of the textbooks was referencing a specific locations from a state neither of us live in and also has a person's name in it, which is neither of our names. I'm less sure this is a scam and more concerned someone tampered with the package. eBay will be able to step in tomorrow so I'm curious what they'll say but I think this new information proves I'm not at fault.",8.0,3,2015-07-02,EBAY,0.038481373339891434,0.9276567697525024,0.03386184945702553

Ebay,"Is this at all dodgy, or did they legitimately not receive the package?","hi /r/ebay,

I hope this post is within the rules and it isn't entirely obvious, I'm just a little stressed out at the moment since I don't use ebay all that much and I'm unfamiliar with the procedures.

So I sold a Graphics Card near a month ago for £56, the buyer had only 3 star ratings, his account has been active since Feb 2014, but all his ratings are from automated sellers within a month, (He has had this account for well over a year and a half and is only just starting to use it this month?) 

I sent the item by Royal Mail 1st Class Signed for, aimed for next day, I kept the tracking number ofcourse but it isn't full-time tracking, it just insures that I posted it in the first place, according to the Royal Mail tracking service, the last recorded scan was when I posted it, but since it isn't tracked, it could be all the way at his local office and he's just waiting to pick it up.

A week later he contacts me asking me if I have a tracking number since he didn't receive it, I gave him the number and said I'd contact Royal mail, they told me I couldn't make a claim until 15 days or so, when he opened a claim against me I submitted a claim to Royal Mail but it'll take up to 30 days to get a response, in the mean time Paypal have reimbursed him and I now have negative balance on my account.

It's clear that the buyer doesn't have the package because he'd need to sign for it and I assume that would update on the tracking number, but could he be waiting to pick it up from his local office when he's gotten the refund?",7.0,3,2015-07-02,EBAY,0.04845624789595604,0.9183676242828369,0.03317609429359436

Ebay,International shipping: your experiences?,"I've been selling on eBay for almost a year. I achieved TRS in December, and am still holding onto my 100% feedback. I live in the United States, and have recently been thinking about expanding globally.

I specialize in young women's clothing. The average item I sell is $13-$20 (kind of cheap for international, I know).

If anyone could share their own experiences and/or answer these questions, that would be great!

- Ship it myself vs. using the global shipping program; which would be better? Bear in mind most of the items I sell are $20 or less. Roughly how much would a 3 oz. item cost the buyer if I shipped myself vs. GSP? I've heard you have more protection as a seller using GSP. I would just like an overall opinion on it vs. shipping myself.

- Can I list an item as free shipping (domestic), but if an international buyer purchases it, have them pay for shipping? I'm not sure how this works. Is there a such thing as ""free shipping"" for global?

- For people with international shipping experience; how much would you say it's increased your sales vs. domestic only?

Part of me doesn't want to deal with international shipping, because i've heard too many horror stories on this subreddit about shit going wrong. I'm debating if the extra sales are worth the hassle.

Thanks in advance.",5.0,6,2015-07-03,EBAY,0.03608415275812149,0.8972585797309875,0.06665720045566559
Ebay,Just bought a $35 PS4.,"Cost $35, worst case scenario, I lose that money. (But 35 bucks isn't much) realistically though, there is a money back guarantee by eBay, so what do I have to lose? Thoughts?",29.0,6,2015-07-03,EBAY,0.36006641387939453,0.5946573615074158,0.0452762097120285
Ebay,"Item paid for but marked as unpaid in my account, seller happy and not opening case, will it affect me? (Story inside)","I purchased a low value ($3-ish) item that I needed relatively quickly.  The seller shipped fast but the item was coming across the country so it took a little while, which was fine.  I see the item tracks to the post office nearest my house but suddenly the tracking shows ""Item undeliverable as addressed"" and it moves to another post office farther away.  The full message said that the parcel would be returned to origin if the information was available on the parcel.  Having had the same address on file with eBay for years, I assumed that either the label was ripped off in transit or addressed incorrectly.  

Needing the item quickly, I ordered one from another seller and messaged the original seller that because the parcel was being returned to them I would prefer a refund than them resending it, they would have their item back, case closed.  So the seller, being a good guy, sends me a message saying he'll refund the money.  Before I receive confirmation of the refund, the tracking changes and the item is headed back towards my house and gets delivered.  I send a message to the seller saying I received it and that he doesn't need to do the refund.  He replies that he already has so I told him that I'd pay him again, of course.

So the trouble starts when, I can only assume, he can't figure out how to invoice me again so I can pay for it.  Instead he sends a Paypal request for the funds, which, absent-mindedly, I paid.

So now, because the Paypal transaction wasn't through eBay, the item shows as unpaid in my account.  I contact eBay, run them through the events, and the guy I speak to sort of bumbles through the issue and tells me to message the seller to have it marked as paid.  I send the seller a message requesting that he do so, and he tells me he can't and that it's all fine and won't affect me.

So here I am trying to figure out if this is actually going to hurt me in the long run.  I have 100% feedback over ~14 years and would like to avoid getting dinged for this in any way.  If he never opens a case will this just go away or will something kick in that actually hurts my rating?

Ebay,Trying to Cancel an Order with Paypal's Pay after Delivery - Need help ASAP please,"I posted this in /r/paypal, but I figured since it also has to do with eBay maybe someone can help me out here

So I bought three shirts from three different vendors on eBay and paid at once (with the cart). I didn't realize Paypal wanted to automatically choose the option ""Pay after delivery"" which I never deliberately chose, and now I realize it's going to do pay after delivery for all three shirts I bought.
Last time paypal did pay after delivery (which I never chose) it waited 2 weeks to take the funds out of my account and then charged me an extra fee of 4 bucks. I don't need pay after delivery and I don't want it.
Now I've requested a cancel for all three orders (seconds after the purchase) and explained that I want to re-purchase them with regular payment immediately.
But will I have to wait 2 weeks for them to take the money out my account and then refund me or what?
This is all confusing and I don't like it, please someone help me out
Edit: So the one seller I contacted was fine with me cancelling, and I see the paypal transaction lists his refund, but it's $8 when I paid $9. Is this normal? Am I not supposed to get all the money back? Also will I have to wait two weeks? I see an option for 'pay for this now' in the transaction. Should I do that?
I wish I hadn't purchased all three orders at once, because if I had just lost the money on one I could deal with it, but together they are quite a chunk of money. This is very frustrating.",3.0,1,2015-07-03,EBAY,0.042676154524087906,0.922898530960083,0.034425292164087296

Ebay,"Item sent via different postal method, can I lose please help!!!","Hi guys, I recently sold another Xbox on eBay and in the listing I selected ""Royal Mail special delivery 9am"" as it is a next day service. 
I then posted the Xbox with Royal Mail first class signed for as it too is next day which I didn't realise before I selected the postage option. 

The buyer has now contacted me saying they haven't received the Xbox and will file an INR against me however I have checked online and the Xbox has been delivered with a signature so I feel the buyer is just trying to pull a fast one since I used a different option than specified. 

So really my question is, if the buyer opens an INR and I provide the number for the Xbox sent via first class that shows a status of delivered, can I still lose as I used a different postal method or is the status of delivered with a signature all the customer services care about?

Ebay,PayPal INAD Case -- can I win if buyer admitted she used/wore the new product? [x-post from r/PayPal],"[SOLVED] - I just gave the buyer a 50% partial refund at her request. Easier than trying to resell it, at least.

TL;DR--Customer opened INAD, but stated in INAD that she used/tried on the new product, voiding eBay's return policy.

LONG VERSION--I sell custom-styled wigs on eBay. Since each wig is styled by hand, the curl patterns vary slightly from unit to unit, but with 20+ sales on the unit, no one seemed to have many complaints.

Until now. I had a buyer file a INAD case through PayPal, and I have no issues accepting the return except that in her initial claim, she stated that she tried on and wore the unit. The units are shipped out new and my listing clearly states that items that are worn are not eligible for return since I can't sell them as new anymore. I would also like to add that I have a 14-day return policy that I would have been happy to follow through with had the item not have been used and not filed via. PayPal.
Her message says this:

""First put wig on on and notice tremendous shedding have hair all over, hair looks very cheap unreal, the curl is the worst part on picture was almost straight with very loose wave. This wig had very defined curls. Not the same at all very disappointing!""

She clearly states in the first line that she put the wig on, thus wearing it and changing it from the state it was received in. If I called PayPal support, do I have a chance in getting this closed in my favor? If the case is closed on PayPal, will she be unable to leave negative feedback on eBay?

Ebay,eBay Messages is horrible,"So I have been a seller on eBay for a while now. I have built a pretty decent business have a warehouse, a few customer service guys (because of the constant barrage of emails that customers have) and a nice steady cash flow. eBay as a whole is a decent service for eMerchants (I use Amazon as well) but I have a serious gripe. Their messaging service stinks. I hate it. eBay Mail is horrendous.

You can't have multiple users with multiple accounts, all my customer service guys have to use the same account. Their is no accountability, we lose track of messages and our ratings get dinged all the time because of it. I cannot even imagine how bigger companies with 100's of customer service agents deal with this. How do you scale your customer service this way? I don't think they ever built eBay with the thought of larger companies selling on their service.

Does anyone know of a solution that can fix the customer service problem for eBay sellers? I cannot keep using their messaging system - its awful.


**EDIT**
Thank you for the replies! 

I have done a bit of research, while tying into the eBay API directly and hiring developers to do so is definitely an option I think it will be a bit too costly.  I have done some googling and found [ChannelReply](http://www.channelreply.com).  They claim to integrate eBay &amp; Amazon messages into Zendesk which is a pretty solid CRM system.  Will let you know how it goes!!",9.0,17,2015-07-06,EBAY,0.07824620604515076,0.8987899422645569,0.022963816300034523
Ebay,PayPal fees are higher sometimes?,"I have an item I sell for $12.99, and after PayPal fees I'm left with $12.31. Occasionally, I'll see a transaction leaves me with just $12.18.

I understand that the fees for my $12.99 are as follows:

    $12.99 * 2.9% = $0.38
    $0.38 + $0.30 fixed transaction = $0.68
    $12.99 - $0.68 = $12.31

So, 68 cents. The breakdown on PayPal shows $0 shipping and tax for both the $12.31 and the $12.18 transactions. It says the fees are $0.68 and $0.81 respectively.

Where is my money going? Is this fraud, or am I totally missing something?

Ebay,Why sellers are leaving eBay,"Buyer purchases fashion item. Requests return stating ""wrong size/doesn't fit"" and proceeds to leave negative feedback stating the item was defective.

I call MSO to request the defect/feedback be removed and I'm told it can't be because feedback is the buyer's opinion and they're allowed to state their opinion. I ask the agent, ""So if I buy an iPad, I can leave negative feedback because it's not a living dinosaur?"" and the MSO agent says, ""Technically, yes"". How ludicrous are eBay's policies? Ugh.

I would have been happy to take the word ""Zumba"" out of my listing. That would have taken less than a minute. Instead my entire posting was deleted and disappeared. Now I have to start all over and sink more of my time into restarting an entirely new listing for the shoes, all for a lousy few dollars that I was trying to get for the shoes in the first place.

When I get it, its not thick and plush at all. Its not the crappy ones, but it feels just a tad less in quality than my Meguiars towel that is just a standard microfiber towel.  And I needed the real thick/plush ones.

Ebay,Item not as described because of measurements.,"I am a clothing seller. I provide measurements of all clothes with a soft, fabric measuring tape. The measurements of these particular pants were waist: 36 in, inseam: 24 in. My listing states measurements are approximate.... (meaning it could vary slightly, right?) 

Waist - I measure at the near top of pants. Across the front, then double it. For bigger/blousier pants, I measure flat across the back then sort of drape the front to get that extra half inch-inch. 

Inseam - crotch hem to bottom cuff. typically the X shape were hems meet on pants. 

This morning I had a case open the pants aren't as described. She states the waist is 34 in. and the inseam is 25 in. She provided pictures of her measurements, with a tool box measuring tape - waist is in a lower/different place. Inseam she did from the leg of the pant to the hem. 

I am SO BUMMED I am getting my first defect rating over an inch and different measuring methods. It's not really worth it to pay return shipping. Do I just apologize and refund her? Or eat the cost, then try to appeal it?

**Update: They're also a clothing seller. 300+ items. Some similar to the one she purchased from me, but she charges 2x what I did.**

Final Update: I contacted eBay for advice on how to handle the situation about different measurement methods. Since she's using a tool box measuring tape (lol), they agreed with me just because of this. I also tried to play the competitor angle - since she has so many similar items and probably was going to resell mine anyway - but they said I need proof of bad past transactions between us. They opened a case on my behalf, the return case immediately sided in her favor (because of my return policy) but she has to pay return shipping. After I receive the return and refund her, I can appeal to get the defect removed. woohoo. I don't care about the return, I just didn't want a defect because of 'wrong measurements.' Immediately after she got the case notification, she messaged me asking for a refund instead - clearly just looking for a deeper discount to resell.",10.0,2,2015-07-07,EBAY,0.041359201073646545,0.9233384132385254,0.03530242294073105

Ebay,Ebay customer service is the worst,"the worse I've dealt with by a long shot.  Those customer reps are absolutely clueless - they each give a different answer in regards to my situation - simple questions such as if I am entitled to getting my initial shipping cost refunded or not.  I end up having to call 10 of them and see how many told me to do this or that, and I have to make a decision from my end.  Even the supervisors are no better - recently one of them opened an escalation case and guess what? The total amount I should be refunded was literally lowered to half the amount in the details page in the resolution centre.  I also previously called a supervisor to complain about this and guess what she tells me - 1) we are 'human' 2)'some of the people who answered you were probably being trained'.  I told her if she's serious or not - she is literally making those silly excuses instead of trying to deal with the moronic customer reps who misinformed me.  Unbelievable.

So basically I lost a few hundred dollars because ebay refuses to refund me the import charges and because the genius seller sent the wrong item.

Ebay,"I sold my Macbook Pro but haven't received payment yet, think someone is trying to scam me. Please help!","Before you ask, no I did not ship yet.  Here's what happened.

My MBP sold on eBay on Monday for $1475.  The Buyer's account (I'll put fake information here so they can remain anonymous, was a business name and shipping address was a PO Box.  For example, it was:

**John Smith**

**Smith Construction**

**PO Box 123**

**123-456-7890**

I looked up the business online and it was legit, and the named matched and everything looked good.  The eBay account was only 1 month old, but I figured, hey maybe the guy made a new account to buy my computer, no biggie.

So John Smith wins the auction, 3 days go by and I haven't received payment yet or any sort of communication. Here's where it gets strange...

Yesterday I called the number to ask him if he still wants the computer.  The number was to his place of business, for which is was the owner.  A woman answers, says John isn't available but asks if she can help.  I tell her what's going on and who I am, and she says that she is John's wife and that she has no clue anything about eBay, and that John hasn't bought a computer at all.  I ask her to look into it and call me back if she finds out anything.

Now, obviously John Smith did not buy my computer.  Is it possible that someone is posing as a business owner and using a random PO Box address to scam me out of my item?  

I canceled the order, but it says I have to wait for the buyer to confirm that he received his refund! But he never paid!! And know I'm probably going to have to pay like $150 in seller fees because eBay thinks my item sold.

Ebay,Issue regarding feedback I received.,"About a month ago I sold an item and the item wasn't in perfect condition, but it was in used condition. In my seller description I listed the things that were wrong with it, took up close photos of whatever damage/dirt/grime I could and informed individuals if they'd like additional photos to please contact me. My item sold.

So, a month and a half goes by and I don't hear anything. Like, nothing. I checked the tracking on the package right around the time it should have been received and it got there safe and sound. Well, when I logged onto Ebay this week to check to see if items I sold were received by the individuals who purchased them, I noticed I had new feedback. I checked my feedback and I received a negative feedback with a positive comment from the person who bought the item sold a month and a half ago. Weird. 

I figured it might have been a mistake, someone was doing feedback quickly and didn't click on positive. So, I filled out the revision of feedback form and contacted the buyer. The buyer responded with the fact they didn't like the condition the item was purchased in and it should have been cleaned and whatnot. They also proceeded to list things wrong with the item that weren't wrong with the item. I haven't responded to their e-mail and I plan to not respond. Honestly, I think I'd be opening a can of worms. 

I checked the feedback they left for others and they have quite a few instances where they'll leave negative comments with positive feedback, and positive comments with negative feedback. 

The question I have is, is it worth contacting Ebay to see if they can look into the situation? I doubt this is a reportable offense, but I'm trying to build up positive feedback, because I know that's what I would want when I purchase from someone and that single negative feedback hurts. I've seen other sellers with negative feedback leave a comment to it in their feedback section, but I can't figure out how to do that. How do I?",2.0,3,2015-07-09,EBAY,0.1326424926519394,0.8393534421920776,0.028004061430692673
Ebay,"Item sold in mid-April with local pickup only. Buyer paid through PayPal, but still hasn't arranged pickup.","I sold a large piece of equipment on April 12th listed as local pickup only, and the buyer lives about 12 hours away. He paid $1000 through PayPal and asked when I needed it picked up. I told him by the end of May. He was planning on having someone drive to pick it up, but then cancelled and said he would arrange for freight soon.

The last time I heard from him was May 26th when he asked for my address. He apologized for the delay, and said he would have it taken care of ""right away"". I sent him my address immediately, as well as my phone number and availability.

That was 44 days ago and I haven't heard anything from him since. I've sent two messages during this time, but haven't gotten a response. I really can't keep this equipment much longer. It's taking up too much space and I need to start downsizing.

What are my options here? I really don't want to give him a refund, mainly because it's been a huge inconvenience to store this equipment for almost 3 months now when I could have sold it to someone else. I clearly told him when I needed it gone, and he's stopped responding.

Can I be held accountable legally if I keep his money, but dispose of the item, or sell it to someone else? Is there some kind of time limit?

Thanks for any advice.

EDIT - I did some research and found out that for both eBay and PayPal, a buyer can only file a case or request a refund within 45 days of the sale. Since it's been almost 90 days since this sale, can he take any action against me at this point if I choose to dispose of the item or sell it to someone else?",4.0,3,2015-07-09,EBAY,0.04029678925871849,0.9225401878356934,0.037163034081459045

Ebay,Am I being scammed?,"Here are the facts:

Seller is a member for 6 months. Has 99% feedback (115 positive, 1 negative). Has several items for sale and all are low in price for what they are, but the items do not look suspicious (products used, unique and unappealing photos, short descriptions, etc).

I purchased a product from the seller and immediately sent payment. The next day, the seller submitted a tracking number (which says it has been initiated but has yet to make any progress despite being an express tracking and submitted two days ago). The seller refunded my payment without any communication.

I fear that the seller is going to say the item has been sent/received but payment was reversed. I've emailed paypal with this, but right now there is little else I can do.

Ebay,Looking to make my eBay listings look more professional.,"Hello everyone, I have been buying and selling items on eBay for the past few years, and have yet to have any real problems.

However, I always feel that my listings are not appealing enough to attract more customers / buyers.

I usually sell video games, consoles, computer parts, and other electronics so I never thought I could really get much better than a few pictures and a brief, but accurate description of each item in a listing.
-----------------------------
For example... I sell Call of Duty, show a picture of the game, back and front of case - and any thing else. Then my text is usually something along the lines of 

''Up for sale is Call of Duty, for the ???? console. Adult owned, smoke-free enviroment. The item comes complete with original game, case and manual. Any DLC / Redemption codes may have been used. If you have any questions, please ask before bidding / buying. Thanks for looking.''

I just been ignoring the messages and sent the item off.  Should I reply back or just post a link to the Buy It Now ebay page.

Ebay,I have selling limits because of my deceased mother's ebay account? Has this happened to anyone?,"So I've been selling on ebay on and off for a while now. I made the most in 2013 when I sold around $4000 worth of stuff. I've started up again and ran into a problem when I was approaching only $500 in sales this year.

My problem is I can't list any more items. I called eBay customer service I was told that since I shared an address with my mother (close to 10 years ago) my selling account has limits on it. 
She sold her artwork on ebay over 5 years ago and I was told her account is suspended because of an unpaid invoice.

I informed them that she passed 5 years ago. I was told I have to provide a copy of her death certificate and pay her outstanding ebay fees?! I don't even know how much it is. It seems so wrong to me that I should pay a deceased persons ebay fees!

It was a sudden death and she had no estate or will to pay them with.

I plan on calling them again in a few hours. I'm just not sure how I should handle this? Has anyone had this happen to their account? 


edit: So I called them again and after speaking to them for half an hour they are willing to waive the fees which are $26.13. Only if I provide a copy of her death certificate though.

Ebay,ShipCover vs. USPS for eBay items?? Which have you had the best/worst experience with?,"I have to ship a higher value item (sold on eBay) that I'd like to purchase insurance for; I see that ebay now has their own insurance, via ShipCover.  It's only $2 more for me to use ShipCover, and if it's a better option, I'm willing to use it, but I've heard mixed things about their service.  The main con seemed to be that 1. If you file more than 2 or 3 claims, they'll say you're no longer eligible for insurance with them and 2.  They're picky with what they cover and have a lot of ""in between the lines,"" exclusions, etc.  I'm not too concerned about 1 (right now at least), although I think that is kinda messed up, but as for 2...I want to know that my  item is insured and I won't get a runaround should anything happen.

As for USPS, I've heard on one side that they're slow as shit and give you lots of problems on getting the insurance money for the item, but then I also read as of fairly recently (i guess the last couple of years?) that they've instituted an online claim system that really speeds up the process.

Oh also I read that if you insure via USPS, it's visible on the package, and a higher target for theft, does anyone know if this is true?  If that's the case that's a big reason why I'd lean towards ShipCover ... but also I'm mailing priority mail, so I mean I know they come with automatic like $50 insurance which is only a portion of my item worth, but still being that it's priority, maybe I should just stick with USPS?

Hopefully I won't have an issue at all with this item and it'll arrive to my buyer successfully and promptly, but like I said it's pretty high value and I'd rather be safe than sorry!!  

Any advice and/or experiences are greatly appreciated!",10.0,4,2015-07-13,EBAY,0.03842441365122795,0.9267610311508179,0.03481459245085716

Ebay,Am I in the wrong here? Need advice.,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ok, so I run an eBay business where I buy, sell and trade old and new video games. I am asking this question about a buyer who is being very difficult and selfishly manipulating the system out of spite, and I wanted to know if I am wrong for doing this, or if I am allowed to do this, based on eBay seller guidelines; I figured this would be the best place to ask, as many of the redditors on this sub would probably know and/or be more savvy than I. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I had a game sell on Sunday, the 5th of July, at 5:17PM, and my policy states that I do not issue returns/refunds. (P.S. eBay is not my only source of income, I am a full-time student, with a part-time job, so I can be very busy sometimes, but I still do my best to please my customers, meet their expectations, and to stick to the guidelines of eBay, and the ones that I set for myself, which are listed with each item I am selling). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So then the buyer sends me a message on Friday, the 10th of July, requesting me to cancel their item and a full refund, as their item had not yet been shipped. And then later that day I barely had to time to even get on eBay, but I marked the item as shipped that same day around noon. Then I receive another message later that day from the buyer saying, ""hey, I sent a message to cancel my order and be refunded, and the next thing I see is a notification that the item has been marked as shipped? What is going on?"" Quite rude. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The issue is that I shipped it out the day before, on Thursday, but didn't have time to mark it as shipped until Friday, and I certainly didn't have time to read their messages. So I read them today, and discovered all of this, and I want to know if I am in the wrong in this situation, as well as what I should do, and/or say to this buyer. Like, eBay isn't my whole life. I do my absolute best to be a good seller, but shit happens, and I'm also quite busy. And I feel like this buyer is being kind of aggressive and selfish with the way they are handling this. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on the page for the item in question, my handling policy says ""usually handling takes about 3 days"".",9.0,2,2015-07-13,EBAY,0.08222600817680359,0.8912730813026428,0.02650088630616665

Ebay,Best way to fight a chargeback?,"Hey everyone.

I sold an item on eBay for $600 recently. The buyer instantly paid via PayPal. The buyers name was in Chinese. However, the shipping address was spelled out in english letters, with a California address. The funds cleared PayPal fairly quick, so I went ahead and shipped out the item. I printed a label on PayPals site, and sent it on it's way. 

Three days later I get an email from eBay saying they canceled the buyers bids because they were not a registered user (kicked out of eBay). I called eBay immediately, and they told me since the buyer sent the payment already, I am required to ship the product. I advised them that I had already shipped it and it was expected to be delivered that same day. 

I shipped it with 2-day USPS Priority, no signature required, no insurance. :(

Fast forward to a month later. I just got an email from PayPal saying that the buyer did not authorize the purchase. I went to the Resource Center and provided proof of shipping, and the eBay email I received. However, thats really all I have.

My PayPal account is negative $600 now. Any suggestions on what else I should do?

Thanks.

**EDIT**: I noticed that they disputed for $623.30, but their payment for the item was only $599.99 (shipped). They asked for more then what they paid?

Ebay,eBay permanently restricted my seller's account - is it fair?,"I'm selling stuff on my website as well as on Amazon and eBay. I'm in UK and items are only sent to UK customers.

Around 2 years ago I started selling on Amazon, with Amazon's FBA (so I sent my items to Amazon warehouse and they were responsible for dispatching it). Around 1.5 years ago I therefore decided to connect my Amazon items with eBay sale. All went fine, with eBay gradually increasing my sale limits. I even reached Power Seller.

Around 6 months ago things changed. I reviewed the Amazon's arrangement and were re-thinking if it's worth actually selling items through them, rather than sending them from my small warehouse. It mostly related to arrangement of Amazon having completely free delivery, which shortly after I opened account with them, they went to £10 minimum order value and recently to even £20 (which is an issue as my item's average cost for a customer was less than £10). This resulted in me not sending more stock to Amazon and selling what I've got there first.

My eBay overall transactions reduced as there was less stock and variations. Also, a software glitch (platform responsible for stock management between different shops) arose, which meant I had to cancel some eBay transactions due to stock not being physically in Amazon's warehouse after being sold on eBay.

In overall, my seller's rating dropped. Out of 1151 transactions within last 12 months, 28 had to be cancelled by myself. 6 had neutral feedback. There were 11 requests of items not received (which were always fully refunded and I think it counts towards the above 28 cancelled transactions). 1 had low detailed seller's rating for postage time. Further 5 had return request for item not as described. 3 open cases for items not as described and 8 low detailed seller's rating for item not as described. In overall, 5.04% of ""defects"" rate. I had I think 1 or 2 negative feedbacks but these were reviewed by eBay or customer and then removed.

When I went above 5%, eBay permanently limited my sale ability, which means I no longer can sell anything. I have contacted them several times about it, but their response is usual ""you didn't meet our minimum performance standards and we can't help you, goodbye"".

So, what do you think? Is this fair for eBay to do so? I get it that yes, some of my transactions had ""faults"" but then again, these were resolved in completely buyer's favour, every single time. 

The fact eBay has these calculations is also unfair. For example, the fact I got most of ""not as described"" ratings or return requests was because customer didn't bother reading item's title and description. It said ""random colour and shape is sent"" and then a complaint they didn't get what they saw on a picture. You may say that it's still a bad practice as picture should be exactly like the item sold but it's not such an easy thing to do, especially if you only have manufacturer's picture of certain kind and hundreds of different items with plenty of their variations...... but I do learn on mistakes and I was gradually replacing my stock with items with particular colour and shape and correct picture.

Or a claim that they didn't get the item. Yeah, like find me a delivery company which can prove 100% deliveries. There is just no way and because I post items myself as well I know that some parcels are lost, delivered to wrong place or customer fraudulently claims he didn't get it, while he in fact did (even if it's with a signature delivery they can say it isn't their signature).

And the cancelled transactions? Yes, again, it's still kind of my side's fault (or more likely that software's supplier) but is this fault enough to completely suspend an account? When a full refund and an explanation e-mail was sent to buyer?

I simply don't get it. EBay doesn't give you any warnings. Any actual information that going below rating WILL result in full account suspension. They just suddenly inform you the account is restricted and there is nothing you can do to improve now.

Is this fair? I have invested in stock and now want to sell it. Not saying about investing in the platform and listing all the items.",24.0,5,2015-07-16,EBAY,0.13289377093315125,0.8348602056503296,0.03224596381187439

Ebay,Can't open case on $9k of broken equipment I purchased,"Last month (June 16th) I purchased a lot of a few ultrasound probes from a seller on ebay (1 listing). Feedback looked good with one negative. The probes were sold used, nothing about as-is. Yesterday (July 18th) I finally got a hold of some testing equipment and turns out some of the probes are not functional. I contacted the seller about this and he refuses to accept a return. When I tried filing a case with ebay I got this:

"" eBay Business Equipment Purchase Protection
Unfortunately, we can't process returns for items in the Business Equipment category.
You can try these options instead:
Contact the seller and ask about returning the item to them directly.
Check if your purchase is covered through the eBay Business Equipment Purchase Protection program.
Learn more about eBay Money Back Guarantee to see if your item qualifies.""

I went ahead and filed a complaint with Business Equipment Purchase Protection (BEPP) program. They wrote back to me with:

Thank you for writing to us about the ******.  I understand your concern regarding the undisclosed damages. My name is **** and I will be happy to assist you.


Because the age of this equipment is not given in the listing, you won’t be able to request a reimbursement through our Business Equipment Purchase Protection (BEPP) program. Equipment with undisclosed damage is only eligible for reimbursement if the equipment is listed or identified as less than 10 years old.

 

If equipment is 10 years or older or the age isn't identified in the listing, there are certain types of complaints that are still eligible for reimbursement. They include:

-- Non-receipt of equipment

-- Receiving stolen equipment

-- Receiving equipment that's a different type, make or model than what was described in the listing

-- Receiving equipment with an undisclosed lien

 

Because of these additional eligible complaint types, information about BEPP program eligibility is shown on listings for equipment more than 10 years old.""

Ebay,"Buyer doesn't open return, but opens Paypal claim. What next?","A buyer has an issue with an item I sold, claiming it does not work -- it is brand new. Buyer mentions they'd like instructions to return it, so after a quick few troubleshooting messages I let them know how to open a return through eBay.

The next day I see they've opened a Significantly Not as Described dispute on Paypal, but no return. I'd like to ask them to open the return, but I see that there's really no reason for them to do that, is there? If all else fails I'd like to ask the buyer to return the item in the Paypal claim, but unlike eBay, I'd assume they have no requirement to return it.

It was shipped internationally, making things slightly less convenient for both of us.

If they simply leave that case open and refuse to work it out, later escalating it, I assume they'd win.

I'm a little lost on what to do here, not just for this transaction, but in general. If a buyer goes straight to Paypal for a claim, as I see it there's no protection at all. No return process if the buyer doesn't want to do it. (Unless Paypal has some requirement for eBay purchases.)

What can I do here? Is there any saving grace?",5.0,3,2015-07-19,EBAY,0.025905538350343704,0.92916339635849,0.04493105039000511
Ebay,Well it was bound to happen eventually,"After selling on eBay for over a year, and with over 1200 positive feedbacks, I finally got my first negative. 

I accidentally shipped the wrong item to a person who then went and opened a return. Of course I agreed, but then he messaged me asking for a return label. I relplied telling him that eBay should send him one automatically as I am opted in to hassle free returns.

He then went and closed the case saying that the seller didn't want to give him a return label. He then went and left a negative feedback saying that I sent the wrong item and no-one should trust me. 

Sure. Don't trust the seller who had 100% positive feedback score of over 1200 before you left yours.

Funny thing is, the feedback right underneath says how I'm such an amazing seller and others should buy from me.

Go figure. lol.

Ebay,"Bought from China, invalid tracking number provided, should I just file a claim now or wait a bit?","I purchased 2 items from a seller on July 2 and was issued a tracking number on the 6th. The number never showed up with China Post. On the 8th I sent a message to the seller asking them if it'd been mailed- they merely tell me to wait 48 hours and it should work by then. Well it didn't, and on the 13th I again message them asking them to verify the tracking they supplied was an accurate number, in case they had typed it in incorrectly. They never replied. My message to them on Friday asking the same also failed to get an answer. Furthermore, someone else I know who bought from them around the same time also got an invalid tracking number. I have tried the number on China Post, 17track and USPS, amongst a few other online tracking services.

On one hand, the seller has a 450 feedback score with a 99.5% positive rating. They could have valid personal reasons for not being on eBay. The number could be a customs form # rather than tracking.

On the other hand, myself and someone else have received bad tracking numbers, they have not relisted any recent stock, and going through their recent sales history it seems they dropped a lot of prices in the past month by quite a wide margin, plus the fact they aren't responding to messages. So far though they have not been getting hit with a string of negatives- their only recent feedback this week has been positives.

Ebay won't let me file an INR claim until after the last estimated delivery date which is in August, but I can file through Paypal directly. I know Paypal gives me 180 days to file. Should I just file now, or maybe wait 2 more weeks? Aside from giving the seller a bit of a chance(I'd hate to file today and have the package show up a day after they refund me), I also don't want to file a claim too early and possibly lose since it would leave me unable to file again on the same. I'm not out much, $35(total was about $54, eBay Bucks rewards paid $19) but if this is flaky I'd rather get the money back now instead of next month.


**UPDATE**- this specific seller has begun to get negative feedback scores for failing to deliver or respond to messages. I've heard from another buyer of theirs that also got junk tracking. I've filed my own dispute directly through Paypal indictaing that the tracking info is bad and they are not responding, so far there are too many red flags. If my stuff arrives I can cancel but I'm playing it safe. Their failure to respond is too worrisome.

As for tracking not working, every China Post tracking number I've got in the past 6 years has worked fine, and I doubt 3 buyers getting junk tracking info from the seller is a coincidence.

Ebay,"Won bid style auction, paid, now buyer claims he sold outside of ebay","Today I won an auction that started at 1 cent and was listed with free shipping.  The item had a BIN of $75 but no reserve.  I ended up winning the item for 50 cents (there were other bidders).  I paid within 10 minutes of winning.  8 hours later the buyer said ""sold it to someone else for $75"".

Ebay,Questions about Dropshipping &amp; Cancelled Orders,"I am both a buyer and seller. I had an interesting buying experience over the past few days. I'm familiar with dropshipping but I thought used a certain supplier? Not Amazon? 

I was looking for a hanger organizer: 

- $9.00 on Amazon (I don't have prime, and didn't need anything else - so shipping was too much.)

- $12.95 from a small eBay seller (with a few negatives and neutrals)

- $14.11 from a large eBay seller (30k items listed) 

- $14.12 from another large eBay seller

I decided to save a dollar and go with the smaller seller, because I am one myself. The smaller seller cancels my order because his 'last 3 in the warehouse are all damaged.'

I go to Amazon - price is now $20-something, the $14.11 priced was raised to $47-something, the $14.12 was gone. $20-30 was now the average going rate on eBay and Amazon.

I asked the $47 seller if I could have the $14.11 price that was listed earlier - he tells me it was a 'limited time sale' and can't honor the price based on his sold history, it wasn't. Nor was it a 'sale', he manually had to change the price.

I ask the $12.95 seller how bad the damage is/if it's fixable -  I might still want the item. He's like ""thanks for shopping at my store. Have a great day."" Okay sketchy. I look at his feedback in detail - lots of cancelled orders and people stating their package came from Amazon. That's weird.

Late last night, I get on my eBay watchlist. The $47 one is dropped down to $14.11 again. (The seller didn't message me back saying I could have the lowered price now.) The $14.12 is live again. The small seller that cancelled my $12.95 order RELISTED the item. I go to Amazon - it's back in stock for $9. I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.  

If you're drop-shipper, would/do you do this? Is it worth it? All three of these sellers are clearly doing the same thing - dropshipping from Amazon. That's like $2-3 profit after eBay fees, right? (I make more than that thrifting + no issues with stock!) Am I missing something? That's a high risk (defects, bad feedback, &amp; unhappy customers) for little profit. Is there some software that manages Amazon stock for you, or do you have to go in and manually change your prices and stock all day on eBay? 

I left the small seller a negative for cancelling with little explanation and relisting. Was that wrong of me?  He immediately sent me message: ""Thanks for your nice feedback! ;)"" Clearly being a smartass about it.

Ebay,Top Rated seller question: is having a basic store worth it or a waste?,"I recently became Top Rated, mostly because there's no real reason not to be. Buyers can return anything despite the sellers return policy if they call mama eBay and handling time isn't an issue. 

So I'm curious what's the point of the store? For the category I sell in (video games, I know I know) being a basic store was a 9% fee instead of 10% but Top Rated is 8% which basically beats out the 9% store rate or at least this is what I was told by an eBay CSR. Is being a store just a waste of money at this point then? I know you get the store link and buyers can look at all your listings but they can do that anyway if they click on your username? 

Any benefit I'm missing or not understanding? 

Update: I'm not actually receiving the 7.2% rate anyway, checked earlier and it comes down to the 9% store rate. When contacting eBay, after being on hold 4 separate times, I was told the discount would finally appear at the end of the statement but not be calculated on the fees tab / page next to each listing until the system updates and the statement is cut.

Ebay,Do I have to wait until the end of the estimated shipping time (1 month window) to file an Item Not Received?,"So I bought something from China; good price but seller had sold many items and 400+ feedback.

Ebay,Received wrong item... Now what?,"Hi,

I usually handle things myself. But this is my first big-dollar  eBay issue. I usually buy cheap stuff from china or things under $50.

Anyway, I bought a pair of Ray-Bans on eBay. I live in Canada and they're from the US.

I received the wrong colour and model. Gold instead of grey. What do I do now?

I emailed the seller (via his personal email, included in a print-out in the box) instead of opening an official 'I didn't receive the correct item' case on eBay.

What normally happens next? I want the sunglasses, not a refund. I'm not sure if I need to pay the return shipping or anything. If I do, isn't that wrong? It's the seller who made a mistake.

If I return them, what's the tax situation?

Any tips appreciated. Thanks!

Ebay,"Crazy buyer put in a bid, should I cancel it?","Long story short I'm relatively new at selling and just opened a store. The item I am shipping is in the 2-3 lb range and someone else is shipping more of the same items for less money (probably because he's using media mail, I can't figure out how the hell the price would be so low for shipping otherwise.) 

My one bidder has been a pain in the ass since day one. He has emailed me three times asking me to lower my shipping once before bidding and then twice after and telling me that my shipping is crazy expensive when it isn't. I have a mail scale and it's correct. I gave a second slightly cheaper shipping option for 2-9 days after that email. Now he's telling me yet again something is wrong with my shipping and that I need to look into it because someone else is selling the same thing but more of them for cheaper shipping. I explained what the reason could be and now I'm awaiting yet another message telling me to lower shipping after they have already bid. If a lower it any more it's coming out of my pocket. Other people in the past have sold the same thing for incredibly similar shipping costs.

 I looked at their feedback left for sellers, most is fine and they don't purchase often but some is negative and the complaints they left are ridiculous, and the sellers response states as much. 

I'd like to cancel their bid and block them because I have a feeling I too will get negative feedback for something out of my control like the weight of the actual product plus secure shipping supplies so they do not break. Do they have any possibility of recourse if I cancel their bid? It hasn't ended yet (over a day left), so I want to say no but I've never done this before.

Fast forward to yesterday and I get a return request from the buyer, and in his message he claims the lens has haze and that it Jams every time it is mounted to a camera. The kicker is that he tried to resell the lens and it was only when it was returned by the disgruntled buyer that he tried to sell to did these issues pop up. I would have been inclined to issue a refund had he not sold the lens once and it left his hands. I can't guarantee the lens is in the same condition as when I sold it, and its nearly been a month. 

He included pictures that claim to highlight the haze, but unless the lens is inspected professionally the images seem useless and its hard to tell what you're looking at.

Ebay,Refund Request - Buyer may be trying to scam me,"Hello,

&amp;nbsp;

To give this case some back story:

&amp;nbsp;

About six to eight months ago I purchased a high end AMD graphics card. A month or two after, I heard about g-sync and around the same time I wanted a high refresh rate monitor, so I purchased the ROG swift and two Nvidia graphics cards. As soon as the new Nvidia graphics cards got in, I took my AMD graphics card out and placed it pack into its box with the foam and eveything with the intentions to sell it if I liked g-sync and whatever else Nvidia had to offer. I of course enjoyed g-sync and discovered shadowplay, which is great for recording gameplay. 

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to last month in mid-June, I list the AMD graphics card on eBay and it sells. I ship the graphics card through UPS with tracking and insurance. UPS somehow provides me incorrect tracking information, but it isn't a big issue as it gets sorted out. I unknowingly upload the incorrect tracking information to the eBay sell. 

&amp;nbsp;


So, over this past weekend the buyer contacted me through eBay saying that the graphics card never arrived and that he wants a refund. So, I contact my local UPS store and find out that it is a different tracking number than what I initially had. I respond to the buyer and correct tracking information. Looking at the tracking, the graphics card had arrived around a week after the card was payed for, and there was a person who signed for it. I informed the buyer of this, and then he goes on to tell me that the graphics card doesn't work. The last time that I used this graphics card, there were no issues with it, and as I stated, the only reason that I switched was because of the g-sync monitor. 

&amp;nbsp;

The buyer tells me that he already owns one of these graphics cards and that his first one works well. He tells me that whenever he tries to start a game, the graphics card that I sold to him will crash his computer. So, I ask him if it is an issue with the power supply(trying to support such high watts with insufficient power) or if it a driver issue. He reassures me that the issue is with the graphics card that I sold him, which I know that there was no issue with the graphics card. I am under the suspicion that his first graphics card was faulty and that he will try to replace it with the one that he bought from me if it gets returned. The case is now under review by customer support.

&amp;nbsp;

Is there anything that I can do to be protected from fraud like this?

&amp;nbsp;

Ebay,"Possibly being scammed for $100 gift card, please help","**EDIT: PSA - Cover Barcodes when selling gift cards...**

About a week ago I received a gift card worth $100 for just under $80. It sold to someone with over 2000 feedback who is an active seller. 

Today the seller messaged me saying ""I received the card, took it to Talbots today and it is worth less than a dollar. Please refund the money I paid you for this gift card.""

I tried to do everything right and refused to email the code, only willing to send it in the mail with tracking. I also refused to sell to anyone with fewer than 5 feedback. 
I had just scratched off the code right before posting the listing so no one had seen it but me. And I checked the value right before listing it on the website and saw it still had a $100 value. 

Here is what the pictures in the listing looked like: http://puu.sh/jd5Sh/2c7b38479d.jpg
http://puu.sh/jd5Ud/773350dcd3.jpg


It sold after I put a 10% off coupon on it, hence why it was just under $80.

Another option I thought of is maybe the first numbers of talbots gift cards are similar and someone was able to guess the code and use up the funds? 

The gift card was given to me over a year ago as a gift during christmas and I sold it because I had no use for it. I don't have the receipt and doubt I can get ahold of it.  I've sold multiple other gift cards through ebay and have never scammed someone and know that I am not this time. Is there anything I can do? I feel like I'm completely screwed.

Ebay,"Am I being scammed? If yes, what should I do next?","Hey guys

I'm really new to ebay, this is only my second ever sale so please bear with me. 

Basically, the highest bidder set a ludicrous amount of money as his bid about an hour before the auction was due to finish and then when he inevitably won, he sent me a message saying that he made a mistake with the amount and if I sent him either my PayPal email address, a PayPal invoice or a PayPal money request he would send the money to me asap. I was unsure about all of this, so I searched paypal money request on Google and it appears that he's trying to scam me. I got this info from here: http://community.ebay.com/t5/Archive-PayPal/buyer-wants-me-to-send-him-paypal-money-request-so-he-can-pay-i/qaq-p/3559585

Anyway, I'm not sure how to now approach this. Is this guy a scammer or is he legit? I obviously want to go through the official channels with this and it seems what he's done is make it so I can't.

I've probably done a shit job of explaining this so here's some images of the suspicious bids (I got two) and the correspondence between him and I.

Ebay,"Sold a hard disk, 6 weeks later guy says it's faulty and wants a refund","Hi folks

I sold a 4tb hard disk on ebay almost 2 months ago. I sold it as used, taken from a NAS but fully working and tested, which it was.   I know this as it was running for two days doing data shredding. 

He gave me good feedback, I did the same for him. Today he opens a case saying that he has bought an enclosure from China and he's fired up the drive and it's clicking and screaming. 

The drive most certainly didn't do this when I had it. He claims it sat on his shelf for 6 weeks while he waited for the enclosure. 

I closed the case on eBay because I feel it's been too long. He then opened a case on PayPal. 

Should I take the hit on a drive that I know was working 2 months ago when I sent it or should I still say no, which is what I am leaning towards?

Ebay,"Buyer is trying to scam me, need help.","So I just sold a Logitech Harmony One Touchscreen Remote for $110. I just got an e-mail from eBay stating that she ""didn't get what was listed"" and she said ""I paid for a Logitech Harmony One universal remote, but I got a tire inflator. I would like to return this at the seller's expense and get what I paid for. Thanks, ck""

This is entirely false and I sent her exactly what was described. I sent it via Priority Mail and bought shipping through eBay.

The weird thing is as SOON as she sent me payment she said ""Please remember to leave positive feedback for me. Thanks, ck"". I didn't leave feedback yet, but I'm assuming she said that so it would have made my case harder against her?

I responded to her inquiry by saying ""A tire inflator? I'm sorry but I think you are mistaken. I would never send out the wrong item, and I'm not sure why you think I sent you the wrong item as I did not have a tire inflator listed for sale so it couldn't have been a mix-up on my part.

Is there anything else I can do?


Edit: UPDATE - So this just got sorted out. Turns out what happened was I shipped the remote in a tire compressor box (I didn't remember because I've been selling a lot of stuff recently and the tire inflator box was the best size to ship the remote in) but I wrapped it in brown paper before shipping it so it looked like a plain box.

Ebay,I'm skeptical about a buyer and I think he's trying to scam me.,"**TL;DR I sold a CPU over a month ago. I heard nothing from the buyer until very recently. Buyer claims it's damaged, but will not say how. It has me thinking the buyer damaged the item himself.**

Quite awhile ago, I upgraded my PC from an Intel i5-4440 to an Intel i5-4670K. Since I had no intentions of building a second computer, I decided to sell it on eBay to recoup some money for the upgrade. This whole process started in the first week of June. 

I took lots of pictures of the CPU and labeled everything I possibly could. I also listed the sale as a ""No Refunds"" sale. The auction went well and the item was sold and for quickly. As soon as the money showed up on my Paypal, I printed a shipping label, securely packaged the CPU, and sent it on its way. I like to keep tracking of deliveries so I kept a tab on this. The CPU was delivered just over a month ago and everything was great. So it seemed. 

A week ago, the buyer contacted me that the CPU was damaged. I asked how it was damaged and I tried to inquire why it took so long to say anything since its been a month or so from the delivery date. He would not state how the CPU was damaged. As far as the long time for contact, He said something about a trip that took two weeks. That still left two weeks or so to try out the CPU so I kept inquiring about the possible damage. Then it was silent for few days. I thought maybe he resolved the issues he had. After about 3 days, he contacted me again saying its damaged. Again, I tried to inquire about how it's damaged, but he would never say. All he says is that it's damaged. I want to know what is wrong with CPU, such as error codes or whatever, but he never says. 

I'm not saying this is the case, but CPUs can easily be damaged through user error. I'm very skeptical about this since it took so long to hear anything back from the buyer. I know it's a working CPU and I doubt it was physically damaged from delivery handling. It's been over a month since the sale and delivery date of the CPU and I feel like I have no obligation for a refund. I feel a bit bad, but my skepticism about the unknown damage holds me back. I don't want to be sent back an ""unknown damaged"" CPU especially considering it could have been user mishandling.

Make it like the watch lists, with tick boxes to select items, and then have options like ""remove selected"" or ""save selected for later"".

2. ""See other items like this"" for custom lists. The default Watch List has a recommended items list down the bottom, where you can scroll through your items and see similar ones. For whatever, your custom named lists do not have this.

3. No auto-redirect to shopping card when adding an item. Sometimes I want to just add the item and keep shopping. Make it like add to watch list, just a little message bar, or like aliexpress, where you get a small popup asking you to either go to cart or continue shopping.\

4. Ability to change default search options. Every time I start a new search, I need to change the options to: ""buy it now"", ""price low-high"" and ""worldwide"", with a page reload inbetween. That is just excessive.

5.

So I did some research and apparently you can upload new listings from the File Exchange templates you can download here;

I can create new variation listings within this template, but getting a successful upload is difficult from what I've seen so far. Nonetheless, once I find the magic combination of success, this will change my eBay listing method and will probably cut my listing time by 75% at least.

I contacted the seller, but while doing so I was notified that the seller ""uses a different ebay"" and therefore there might be a language barrier. Nonetheless, I sent him a message, and have yet to hear a response. What should I do? I'm afraid he hasn't gotten the notice and won't be able to read my message, and will consequently file a claim.",4.0,3,2015-07-29,EBAY,0.17980490624904633,0.7895532250404358,0.030641933903098106

Ebay,"2 consecutive eBay Scam, thinking about report to police, suggestions please!","To start with, these 2 cases are involved with high end photography gears, one is about $5k, the other is about $12k

**1st one**, seems to be quite strange. The seller seems legit, his description seems to make me believe he knows his equipment, and contact me right after payment. I also googled all the photos, seem to be unique (not copying from elsewhere)

However, the recipient in the Paypal has a different address as listed in eBay. This recipient is easily googled out, turns out to be a fresh college graduate, who I don't quite believe has anything to do with photography and has the money to own the system. 

It has been almost 1 week (paid last Thursday), never replied any of my messages. 

**2nd one**, the payment was not accepted then cancelled by me. After that, the seller was asking ACH transfer and offering discount. I declined, then he opened case to cancel the deal.

Really looking to report to police especially the 1st case. No matter what police ends up doing, but if cops take it seriously, it could not be better.

Any suggestions/advice are highly appreciated! Thank you guys!!

**EDIT: The first buyer claimed his daughter was ill so that's why took so long, will see. But still quite suspicious about that Paypal recipient, this eBayer claimed the Paypal recipient is his business partner**",9.0,3,2015-07-29,EBAY,0.04880084469914436,0.916282057762146,0.034917090088129044

Ebay,Did I do this right?,"I re-listed my laptop that used to be auction to buy it now or best offer. I was on mobile.

Umm.. Does calculated shipping count as a specified shipping cost? My laptop just sold and I'm stressing out because I'm not sure if it's instant payment and 2 people have already done literally nothing after winning the auction. No contact, no payment. That's why I switched to fixed price,  because I wanted instant payment... I assumed no option meant instant payment, as eBay never said anything about pay later on the info page in that section. I'm just now thinking about it and I'm getting super stressed out because I need my laptop to sell really badly.

Ebay,Buyer's remorse return. Gonna fight this one out,"Just got a return request for a tablet I've sold numerous times.

""I received this tablet today and was very disapponted when i open the bos and found no charger and when I tried to turn it on, it did not work. I cannot belive you selled thos Item for $84.99. It s nothing but crap."" 

Called eBay, was told buyer is probably gonna win even though it seems pretty apparent to me that it's buyers remorse.  Guy claims he was disappointed it didn't have the charger, yet it clearly states in the listing that it doesn't include anything.  Guy tried to turn it on, but it didn't power on, yet he was complaining about a charger a minute ago.  Item showed up as delivered 15 minutes before he opened the case, I doubt he even charged it. 

I'm pretty open to returns even though I state I don't accept them but when they have a bad attitude, I'll make sure to make this return painful if it's forced.

Ebay,Scammed out of 400 dollars.

Ebay,Am I being lied to?,"I won two auctions on July 22nd and paid that day, immediately upon winning. A week later I realized they still weren't marked as shipped and the auction stated they ship within two business days. 

I emailed the seller asking about it. He messaged me back a day later saying that he went to the post office and the package sat there for a week because of insufficient postage. 

He claimed he would give me a refund for waiting and that he shipped it. 

It has been one day, no refund, and he showed only shipping one of the boxes. I messaged him again today about the second auction and he didn't respond, but listed it as shipped. 

Tracking shows that the one item was picked up and processed yesterday. Is he lying about even shipping it the first time?  Shouldn't he have marked it shipped a long time ago if he had? How can I prove he waited a week and a half to ship when it finally arrives?  

Also, is this situation enough to leave negative feedback and demand a partial refund?  He did mention a refund, so he's now obligated, correct?",7.0,6,2015-07-31,EBAY,0.049857981503009796,0.9089308977127075,0.0412110798060894

Ebay,Question about stolen pictures?,"Going back to February and as recently as June, a ""top rated seller"" has been lifting both my photographs and item titles. I filled out somewhere over a dozen report forms in that time. Frustrated, I turned to customer service, which has been required of me three times so far.

No action was taken on the first call, though I was reassured they would investigate it in a matter of hours. The second representative was kind enough to call me back the next day and let me know the problem was resolved. Except upon checking, some of the offending items were not removed and ones that were, already got relisted the previous day.

Yesterday the representative I got seemed to want me off the phone as quickly as possible, and nothing has changed since.

Every call I provide them with their current item numbers and my own that have the exact same pictures dated back to last year.

In two years of selling, I've never had something happen like this. I own a small store and these items make up a good percentage of my sales.

Ebay,Ebay email notification problems. Anyone else getting the same problem? (You will need to understand email a bit to find out),"Some time between March and May this year, ebay appear to have changed something in their notification system. The last ""good"" email notification I received was 4 March, and as I was away for 6 weeks nothing happened to make ebay send me a notification until about 3 weeks into May, this was my first ""bad"" email notification.

The problem I'm having is that the email is a multipart MIME message, and the text/plain part of the message (which my accessibility aid uses) seems to have disappeared. The message is still MIME encap, but only text/html part is delivered causing it to be read by my screenreader as a blank message.

The types of message known to be affected are ""Order Confirmed"", ""Order Dispatched"", ""ENDING"", ""You Won"".  

Unaffected is ""Your invoice for"". I haven't checked any others.

My email preferences are set to text/plain.

Ebay's online support suggested I need to install Chrome to make this go away, but were unable to tell me how a web browser can affect email. I was left with the impression that ""install chrome"" is ebay's version of ""we don't know the answer so stop asking"". 

Community boards were equally clueless and concentrated on victim-blaming (nobody else is having this problem) and on facetiously encouraging me to change my browser to chrome, from chrome to ie, etc etc. So far, of the people who have let me view-source their emails from ebay 100% are having the same problem (but didn't realise it because their webmail progs are using the text/html part), and this includes users on Windows, Linux, and Mac using Firefox, IE, Chrome, Chromium, Opera and Safari.

What I'd like to know is:-

1. Does anyone have emails of the types listed above from after 4 March and before 20 May, and do they have a text/plain mime part? I'm trying to narrow down the date of the change.  Everyone who allowed me to examine their emails so far hadn't kept any notifications older than a couple of weeks.

2. Does anyone have any way of contacting someone technically competent at ebay? It seems clear to me that something has gone wrong, they probably don't realise, it doesn't seem likely they would do this on purpose because it  has no benefit that I can see and will make their notifications more likely to get stuck in spam filters (SpamAssassin has the rule MIME_HTML_ONLY, it's likely that other packages have a similar rule).",0.0,4,2015-07-31,EBAY,0.19018903374671936,0.7859931588172913,0.023817814886569977
Ebay,Different weights when dropping off packages,"I use ebay to print prepaid label and then drop it off at the post office. I measured using my home scale for a package I was sending to be 45 oz or 2lb and 13oz. I did this three separate times so I know it should be pretty accurate. When I dropped off the package at the post office I asked for a receipt. They measured the weight of the box and printed one out to me. When I got home I noticed the receipt said 3lb 5.5oz. That's a big weight difference. The clerk didn't say anything when she scanned and measured it.

Will this pose a problem? I don't believe my scale is wrong since previous packages were pretty accurate when compared to the measured weight at the post office.
