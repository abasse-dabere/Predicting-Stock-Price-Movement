Ebay,"New seller, already made some rookie mistakes, any tips or advice from the veterans?","Hi Reddit,

I am looking for some advice from the more veteran ebay seller crowd.  I am a long time buyer but never really sold a whole lot until recently.  Made a few mistakes already that lost me money.  I listed a few dvd box sets for 0.99 thinking people would bid it up... didnt happen.  Also estimated shipping weight and ended up paying more than buyer paid me... lost completely on that sale.

I don't want to keep hitting the red on everything I sell so does anyone have advice or tips?",11,4,2012-04-01,EBAY,0.11599397659301758,0.8524782061576843,0.031527839601039886

Ebay,"Classic sticker collection books, a quick query.","I just moved back home from uni for easter and was shuffling a few things around in my room when I found an old Merlin stickers sticker book from Euro '96 in England.

There are some on there at buyitnow for over £100 but even on the ones that are open for bidding, there doesn't seem to be any interest.

Does anyone know of any specialised sticker collection sites as an alternative to wasting money on listing fees?

Ebay,Low feedback user buying items just to leave bad feedback and DSRs,"User ""(buyer's name is removed says)"" has successfully bought an item from me, he waited until he knew that I shipped it, then he attempted to cancel the order. He tried to open a buyer protection case before appropriate time had passed to even open one. He lied in my feedback saying I used foul language and left me low DSRs. He has done this to more than just me (see image: http://i42.tinypic.com/106a741.jpg). I called eBay and they said what he is doing does not qualify for their feedback removal policies. This is a load of bull$h!t. Upvote if you are fed up with eBay's lack of common sense.

Our dialogue

(buyer's name is removed says): ""I WOULD LIKE TO CANCEL THIS ORDER THANK YOU""

me: ""I'm sorry but I shipped your item out already. I updated the tracking info.

You can return it for a full refund as long as it is unopened. If you are around when they deliver it you can ""reject"" the package and they will just return it. Once it has been received I will process a full refund.

Otherwise, we can just ship it back to me, as long as the game isn't opened I will give you a full refund.""

He tries to open a buyer protection case with no further correspondence.

Me: ""I noticed that you attempted to open a buyer protection case. Please be patient, your item is on the way. Your chosen shipping method takes 3 to 9 business days to arrive, and it has only been 6 business days. Please check my feedback for reassurance that I always send my products when they are ordered. You can track your package at USPS.com with tracking number 9102901001302324296596

As a general rule of thumb, if you have a question it is better to contact the seller before attempting to open a buyer protection case.""

(buyer's name is removed says): ""THE ITEM THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE IS RETURNING IT SO PLEASE I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPEN JUST GIVE ME A FULL REFUND IM VERY UNSATIFY""

Me: ""I understand that you are unhappy. You will get your full refund when the item is returned to me. After attempts to deliver you the item fail the post office will return it, and then you will get your money back. Please do not worry, and thank you for being patient.""

Then he leaves me bad DSRs and negative feedback which states: ""USING FOUL LANGUAGE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO DO BUISNESS""

I send him a message: ""Did you confuse me with someone else when you left me that negative feedback? I have not used foul language with you, and nearly one thousand people disagree with you about my business skills.""

Of course there is no response, and eBay takes his side on this issue.

Ebay,The subject and criticism of my moderation to /r/eBay.,"It has been made clear [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/rxjx4/ebay_employees_should_not_be_moderators_of_this/) that some feel I should not moderate this subreddit as I am an eBay employee.

I would like to address the concerns individually.

&gt; It is a blatant conflict of interest to moderate this sub as an eBay employee

* A conflict of interest is defined as: *a situation in which a person has a duty to more than one person or organization*. In this case, I am not officially representing eBay, but I am identifying my affiliation with eBay with the notation that *my opinions are my own*, following employee policies on blogging. My methods of moderation are the same on all the subs that I moderate, being an eBay employee does not change that here. An actual conflict would occur if this was [/r/eBaySucks](/r/eBaySucks) and that conflict of interest would be with eBay, and not reddit.

&gt; It is inappropriate for eBay staff to have control over this subreddit.

* If that were true, the reddit admins would not have granted me moderation to this sub. The moderator 'Thumperings' has been inactive for over two months which qualifies for reddit takeover. When I first came to this sub, the moderation queue and spam filter had not been worked in years. There were several legitimate posts flagged by the spam filter that I approved and are now visible to everyone. Yes I have added a set of rules to follow but they are not that strict. *Don't be a troll, don't post another users account information, only post eBay auction links within reason and message the mods with link reports*. That's it! I have not deleted any posts that did not violate those easy to follow rules. Many popular subs have similar rules and operate effectively. The question of *Rule II* conflicting with *Rule III* has been addressed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/rx34u/low_feedback_user_buying_items_just_to_leave_bad/c49dlcu).

&gt; You being the moderator hurts the integrity of this subreddit.

* How so? I have not taken over and deleted all the posts that I disagree with or banned those that are critical of eBay. This is still the same subreddit with just a bit more structure (and flair). Yes, one of the rules is that this is not a place for posting how much eBay sucks, those types of posts are typically biased and nonobjective. A person can post that they do not agree with a decision that eBay made in a constructive and civil manner, and get feedback from the other readers.

The bottom line is that I am here to help, not dictate. It is a privilege to be a moderator here at [/r/eBay](/r/eBay). I have the vision for this sub to be a friendly place to get answers from everyday people and experts on eBay topics. It seems there will always be those out there that disagree with my presence here and for that we will have to agree to disagree, I don't plan on stepping down.

I can assure you that I am a fair and objective person in real life. I have a great career, a loving family and a overall positive outlook on life. I hope that the majority of us can work together here and make this a great sub.

Thank you for reading,

Ebay,Does eBay ever actually read the reports I send about this pirated / counterfeit music compilation?,"So I have a saved search which emails me notifications of new listings for the CD set ""[The Blues Collection](http://www.discogs.com/lists/The-Blues-Collection/25834)"".

As per the link ([more](http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=314578)), this is a set of 90 CDs (92 including Christmas issues) that were published by Orbis during the 90s as a monthly partworks - sold at newsagents, each issue comprised the CD of music and a biography magazine, each dedicated to a different blues artist (occasionally a ""genre"" compilation of *Women of The Blues*, *Texas Blues* or *Thirties Blues* was released instead of a single specific musician). 

[For the benefit of anyone who's interested in the blues, this is actually an *awesome* and comprehensive compilation, with a lot of diverse stuff on there, at least 80 different musicians. All the CDs (that I've listened to so far, anyway) are of good quality remastered recordings. Although you'll see sets listed as buy it now for £150, if they're auctioned you'll pick up a full set for £30 or £50. I do feel sorry for the poor schmucks who paid £450+ for these originally, though.]

So I've been watching these listings for 6 months or more, because they're really too heavy to post and because I'm waiting for a set to come up locally. I actually already have a full set of CDs, but I'm keeping my eye open, hoping I can find another one that's complete with magazines and binders. 

So I'm familiar with this item. Firstly the CDs have never been reissued since the 90s, they're only available on cassette tape and CD. And secondly I've never seen fakes until 2 weeks ago, when someone offered them burned on DVD as a collection of MP3 files. Clearly a fake.   

When I saw the first fake I reported it, and then the second, too. Although I haven't kept track, I'm assuming they're all the same guy since they've all cropped up in my notifications within days of each other. I remember that at least one of the previous listings I reported the seller had loads of existing feedback, and that matches with the 1000+ positive feedback of the latest one. I presume the bloke hasn't even bothered buying the CDs and ripping them himself, as the whole lot are available as a single torrent at the usual piracy sites. 

So I just got *another* notification of another new listing for this pirate DVD of the music. 

Is it worth me bothering to report it?       
Because, honestly, doing so is starting to get a bit disheartening.

Ebay,"I got a major policy violation, ""listing removed for hateful or discriminatory"" and contains ""Nazi marching music..promoting Nazi Party idealogy"", but there's only one problem, this item doesn't have or do any of those things.","Warning, very long..

Here is the letter I sent to ebay:




Dear EBay,


I am contacting you because I had a listing removed and related policy violation.  I hope  to appeal to you to have the record of the violation removed from my permanent seller record.

 

MC999 eBay Listing Removed: Hateful or Discriminatory (566370188)

120859928258 - RESIDENTS - Third Reich 'N Roll CD 1987 orig 2nd Press w/ bonus tracks ESD 80032

""Your listing was removed because you have listed Residents-Third Reich N' Roll which is identified as Nazi Marching Music, or promoting the Nazi party and is not allowed on eBay. Please do not re-list.""

 

I believe this removal is in error, as this cd does not have any marching music in it at all, nor does it promote ANY political ideas in any way. It is a musical collage of 60s pop songs and commercials.

 

Here is an excerpt from the album review from the Wikipedia article:

""The Third Reich 'n Roll is a 1976 album by the U.S. avant-garde rock group The Residents. Their second (officially) released album, it is a parody and satire of pop music and commercials from the 1960s. The work consists of two side-long pastiches of various songs from the period.""  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Reich_%27n_Roll

 

The first track is called Swastikas on Parade, but it is not about Nazi's and it is certainly not marching music.

Here is the song for review on YouTube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01wnS5kiwmg

 

Here are the lyrics to the song:

Swastikas on Parade Lyrics

The Residents

Na nananana, nananana
Nanana nanana
Nananana

Got to know how to pony like Bonny
Mash potato, do the alligator
Put your hand on your hips now
Let your backbone slip now
Now do the Watusi
Like my little Lucy

I saw her walking on down the line
You know I saw her for the very first time.
A little girl walking all alone.
Pretty baby, can I take you home?
I never saw her, never, ever saw her.

My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky
My baby does the hanky panky

Does the hanky panky, does the hanky panky,
does the hanky panky, does the hanky panky...

Woke up this morning, my head was so bad
It was the worst hangover that I've ever had
What happened to me last night
That girl of mine she loved me so right
Loved me so long, yeah she loved so hard
I finally passed out in her front yard
It wasn't wine that I had too much of
It was a double shot of my baby's love
Double shot of my baby's love yeah

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter

I don't care how much money I gotta spend
Got to get back to baby again
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter
She wrote me a letter...

Listen mister, can't you see I got to get back
To my baby once-a more
Anyway yeah

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter
My baby, just-a wrote me a letter

I feel depressed, I feel so bad
'Cause you're the best girl that I ever had
I can't get your love, I can't get a fraction
Uh-oh, little girl, psychotic reaction
And it feels like this!

[noises]

Hey, little girl, you don't have to hide nothin' no more
You didn't do nothin' that hadn't been done before
You can leave, little girl, I don't want you 'round no more
Too bad, little girl, it's all over for you...

I got me a complication
And it's an only child
Concernin' my reputation
As something more than wild
I know it serves me right
But I can't sleep at night
Have to hide my face
Or go some other play-ay-ay-ay-ay-ace

Here is another review that additional addresses how the album is not ""promoting the nazi party"" in any way, it is taken from the highly regarded music review website, the allmusic guide:

""If there's any concept here, it's that the brain-numbing catchiness of pop music was fascism in disguise, keeping teenyboppers docile while selling them rebellion, hence the cover art of a gestapo-uniformed Dick Clark holding a carrot.""  http://www.allmusic.com/album/r47814

Currently there are over twenty copies of this album listed on eBay in varying formats. At least ten that are nearly identical to the one that I listed:

http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=residents+third+roll&amp;_sacat=See-All-Categories

 
Amazon has a similar policy on hateful material to eBay, and here are there many listings for this item: http://www.amazon.com/Third-Reich-N-Roll-Residents/dp/B000AP2ZQW/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329425731&amp;sr=1-1

 
For many many music fans around the world, this album is a historical artifact, and certainly a highly regarded work of Avant garde art. But most importantly, it is not at all in any way contain ANY iota of nazi marching music and is not in any way ""promoting the nazi party""

I am very concerned with having a drastically lowered seller rating due to this apparent mistaken policy violation. It also seems very uneven, random, and selective that I was given such a harsh policy violation, when many many sellers are allowed to sell this item with no trouble at all. I do not feel this is a fair or equitable way to treat a small seller. This policy violation could be very detrimental for me as a seller. I think ebay is great, and am looking forward to becoming a power seller and beyond.

I am writing this email to formally appeal to ebay to please remove any record of the policy violation from my permanent seller record.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

-derpderpton



When the violation first occured, I immediately called ebay. Ebay asked me if I received an email regarding this, I said I had received an email from a ""do not reply"" ebay email address. The agent told me to reply to that address, I said okay. I then sent this email to that address,also to whyended@ebay.com and also as an ebay message to customer support directly in ebay. I received no response for a few more weeks. I then called ebay again, I had to explain this long and increasingly complex story to a person who didn't not understand all of my english. They found my emails and told me they would directly personally forward it to the department that handles this type of case, and they promised and guaranteed I would receive an email response within 48 hours from someone in the final say department regarding this. I did not receive a message. I called ebay maybe four days later, went through it all over again, to come to a ""supervisor"" who assured me, again, that she would do the same as the last, forward to bosses yadada, but she wouldn't promise me a response within 48 hours, but just said, I would receive a response. This was four weeks ago, haven't heard a peep from ebay yet.


tl;dr   Ebay removed a listing and slapped me with a serious policy violation which is totally incorrect, random, and arbitrary and repeatedly has failed to deliver any sort of meaningful or satisfactory customer service resolution or even engagement. And lastly, yes, it was quite clear that none of the agents spoke english as a first language and i did have trouble communicating complex, off cue card, topic matter.",7,1,2012-04-07,EBAY,0.10548148676753044,0.8663140535354614,0.028204433619976044

Ebay,"Need help proving the item I received was ""not as described"".","I bought an item from eBay that was described as ""unopened"". When I received the item this was clearly not the case as everything in the box was not how it should be if bought from a shop, i.e. someone had opened it and repackaged it. So I open a case against them. I still want the item as it was for a time-sensitive gift (hence the requirement that it has been unopened!) so I suggest in the resolution centre that I receive a partial refund. This to me seems fair, as the item isn't worth as much if it's not genuinely ""brand new and unopened"". But the seller is not being helpful in the case, so we are waiting for eBay to make a decision. So my question is this:

How do I prove that it wasn't as described ? 

N.B. I appreciate that a lot of sellers on here (me included) have had stuff done to this against them by con artists, but this is clearly not the case. I have a 100% 150+ feedback rating as a buyer and seller. But I've never had to open a case as a buyer before, and I don't know the procedure from now on. I don't want to ""threaten"" him with negative feedback, but I guess that is why sellers make buyers happy with partial refunds? However this just seems like eBay bullying to me. (though his unhelpful and rude manner and item not as described will get him negative feedback). 

Any thoughts?",9,1,2012-04-08,EBAY,0.08435800671577454,0.8865465521812439,0.02909540943801403

Ebay,Help! My boyfriend received a package. The seller paid postage for a medium flat rate box but used a different box instead. He wound up with $24.15 postage due.,"My boyfriend won a PS3 on eBay from a seller that has over 800 feedback and only one recent negative rating that had nothing related to the problem my boyfriend is having. He received the box (a relatively large box wrapped in brown paper) when he was at work and his brother answered the door. The postman said that in order to get the box he had to pay $24.15 in postage due and that the seller probably did this on purpose because obviously flat rate postage goes on a flat rate box and he should've known that.

So, my boyfriend gets home from work and contacts the seller. The postman didn't give him a receipt for the money he paid him, but he has the box (so he had to have paid) and the box has the stamp on it with postage due and the amount written as well as ""Medium Flat Rate"" circled on the top. The seller accuses him of ""mail fraud"" and says that he's lying because the post office would've sent it back to his house. He also says that the post office wouldn't have let him pay the wrong amount. Since he paid online, he just had to go drop it off. He could've easily put it on the counter and avoided any conversation with the people at the post office. He's threatening to send this case to a small claims court and claims that my boyfriend is ""trying to get a free PS3 from him"". Literally wtf. Is there anything my boyfriend can do about this? The seller had marked his listing as ""free shipping"" and obviously took the easy way out. Gah.

tldr; Boyfriend received item in a box that wasn't a flat rate box. Seller paid medium flat rate box. Boyfriend wants a refund of the $24.15 he had to pay to get the box. Seller threatens to sue him for mail fraud.  

Any help? Please?

It seems to be happening to me every single time I put something up these days. 

I can't stand it. When I buy, I pay immediately. I rarely get to experience what the opposite end of that is like. The most interesting part is that I never, ever see anything in their feedback mentioning that they take their time.

Ebay,Does this buyer seem off to you?,"Hi everyone,

So I sold an item tonight on eBay (an iPad), the guy bought it within 5 minutes of the item going up (he chose the buy it now option, which was £200 more than the starting bid). He also has 0 rating/feedback. He then sent me this in my inbox:
""HI, I WILL LIKE YOU TO REPLY ME ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THIS ITEM ONCE AGAIN AND SEND ME WITH THE PICTURES OF THE ITEM TO MY EMAIL ADDRESS:**censored for privacy reasons.** ONCE I RECEIVE YOUR EMAIL I WILL MAKE PAYMENT FOR THE ITEM ASAP. REGARDS.URGENT REPLY ASAP.""

So I sent him photos and replied pretty quickly, but it's been almost 4 hours and he hasn't replied. Is this guy taking the piss out of me? Could he possibly just not reply and will I have to pay to list the item again? Or am I just being paranoid. Apologies if this is a ridiculous question, but I've never sold on eBay before and I honestly have no idea what I'm doing.

Thanks for reading!

Ebay,new seller - issuing a return / refund,"I'm pretty new to ebay selling, so thought I'd post here for input, given that I've not done any of this before.

I've just received a mail from a buyer, he says the item received (clothing) is not as described - an inch smaller in size, so presumably doesnt fit him.

I disagree that the item was described wrong, but either way, if it doesn't fit I have no problem with a return and refund. Does this mean I will end up being out of pocket for postage though? Do I need to open a case, or just do this through emails and send a refund?

Ebay,IF YOU SELL OR INTEND TO SELL ON EBAY READ THIS!!!,"Please read this completely, IT WILL SAVE YOU MONEY &amp; TIME! 

I have seen a lot of posts on this eBay-reddit about problems with buyers claiming that they never received their item. They then file a complaint and eBay issues them a full return. And you loose your money. 

Here are the facts: 

* Some buyers hope you don't get tracking or insurance, so they can claim you never shipped it. Once they get the package and see there is no tracking then they know they have you. 
* If you don't purchase some  form of insurance or tracking you are screwed, end of sentence. 
* Just a receipt from the post office does not count for anything, it is just a receipt. eBay litigation will not care, and there are no numbers on it to provide for tracking. 
* Getting tracking is easy, buy your label straight off eBay and it is FREE. I highly recommend this method, it is very easy. Hell my mom uses it. AND eBay automatically registers that you shipped it so there is no arguing that fact. 
* If your item is over $40 ALWAYS get a signature with the package. It only costs $2.10 if purchased online. This is irrefutable proof of delivery. 
* If it is over $50 I highly recommend getting insurance. If the item is over $200 insured then the signature confirmation is free. There is no downside to this. 
* If you are shipping overseas then you have to buy more expensive Priority shipping to get tracking or insurance. But it is completely worth it if the item is over $40. My rule of thumb is that it will usually cost the buyer in shipping $29 if its going overseas. 


There is also a highly effective way to scare off these people, put this in every selling listing you post: 

&gt;Beware e-sellers, there are people out there trying to rip us off. They wait until they get the package and see if there is a tracking number on it. If there isn’t then they report they never got it and demand their money back.  These people are human garbage.

I highly recommend you copy and paste this in your listing. Even if the item is only $5 and you don't intend to actually buy insurance, it will scare them off.

Ebay,To anyone who sells stuff of eBay. PayPal vs Authorize.net,"After reading the post earlier about PayPal giving $2500 back to the buyer of a antique violin so long as he smashed it to pieces and sent proof, I just wanted to point out that there are indeed other options for receiving payment when you sell stuff on eBay. 

PayPal is great if you aren't selling a lot of stuff and only sell every once in a while, but if a major part of your income comes from eBay sales, I'd recommend going with Authorize.net. Its one of the top credit card processing companies right now ($1 out of every $4 spent online when through them in 2011). Yes its $99 to sign up, but its well worth it if you sell a lot. 

Note: I do not work for Authorize.net, I simply have hated PayPal with a passion every since they refused to give me my money back when I purchased a $600 TV on eBay and what I received was the correct box, but inside was nothing but dumbells surrounded by packing material (and no, nothing in the description mentioned this, before you ask).

Ebay,"Buyer said they returned item to me by writing ""Return to Sender"" on the package and it has not arrived, now what?","I don't usually accept returns but I made an error in my listing and they wanted out of the auction so b/c it was my error I granted it.

The buyer contacts me wanting their refund so I ask for a tracking number and they tell me that they just marked ""Return to Sender"" on the package.  When I check the original tracking from when I shipped the item, the information shows how it was sent, delivered and then sent back to sorting but it was never updated again after that... 

Not quite sure what is going to happen from here on out... I was under the impression that this person would pay for shipping out of their pocket ($2) and would get a new tracking #.

Ebay,Input on imbecile from Russia wanted,"I sold a pair of shoes. Two days later I get a message from the buyer stating that she doesn't want to buy the shoes now. I replied ""As stated in the listing: If you bid on this item you agree to pay for it within 7 days of winning the auction.I understand that things come up, so if you need to take a few days before paying, that's fine. You are, however, responsible for paying for the shoes you bid on.""

I have to charge twice the amount I should have to so I can get delivery confirmation because of people like you.)  and a few minutes later, another: ""These shoes won't fit me!

I escalated the issue with PayPal but they said I need to prove I sent it back by showing a tracking number/parcel (I didn't know this was a requirement) or else they can't do anything about it. Apparently the message saying he received the phone back isn't enough.

Ebay,How Ebay/Paypal are now screwing sellers even more...,"So I recently logged into my Paypal account after having a moderately sized sale of $800.  I was actually logging in to pay the Ebay account balance I incurred from the sale which was around $40.  Imagine my surprise when I discover that I have ""limited availability"" concerning these funds.

I hadn't done any business for a couple of months and perhaps a large transaction had been flagged as out of character.  This was not the case.  The problem was related to my Ebay account.  My seller performance was labeled ""below standard"" and my paypal account was now subject to new restrictions.  These  included limited access to funds ranging from between 3 days after confirmed delivery to 21 days post uploading of tracking information.  This may not seem like a big inconvenience, but when you consider that buyers may take a week  to pay, the paypal account freeze, and then a 3 day wait time for bank transfer I realized that Paypal is withholding my money for a period of one month and earning interest on it while the buyer has their item within 3 days.

So I call Ebay to find out what my account problem is and it turns out I sold 5 sports cards for a total of $23 about 2 months ago.  That buyer left me 5 1's in the Detailed Seller Rating (DSR) category of Shipping Cost.  These low ratings put me over my total and percentage quota allowed by Ebay. I personally combined shipping to 4.95 in a USPS Flat Rate Box per his request as he wanted to receive the items quickly.  This one individual's low marks (for a service I provided at his request) resulted in Ebay immediately enacting restrictions on my Paypal account.  Ebay refused to remove the DSRs even though the seller left me + feedback for each transaction. I have been on Ebay for 7 years with exemplary service, over 1000k + feedback with no negatives, and sales totaling over $44,000.

I realized that this is how Ebay/Paypal do it.  The Unrealistic DSR program exists solely to mark large volume accounts as “below standard.”  Unfortunately I was one of the small flies that fell into this trap.
Due to passive aggressive c---- who AGREE TO YOUR  AUCTION TERMS  INCLUDING THE SHIPPING COST, sellers can lose benefits such as listing discounts and have access to their funds limited with no recourse.  This apparently is not an isolated problem.  Paypal is not a escrow service and it has to be illegal that they are earning millions of dollars in interest per day on withheld funds.  I am now subject to Paypal account restrictions for a period of 10 months until these DSRs fall off in February of 2013.

If anyone else has restrictions due to some similar garbage there is one way around it.  You can use Ebay as a classifieds section by listing your items, removing them when a buyer asks you to end it early, then receiving a direct paypal payment.  This saves the buyer money due to lack of an Ebay markup you have to account for and non Ebay payments are not subject to the restriction.  I have never once been screwed out of money by a dishonest buyer when taking a direct paypal payment.",0,1,2012-04-23,EBAY,0.12176508456468582,0.8561581969261169,0.022076712921261787

I sold an item on eBay about two weeks ago, the funds say they're in my PayPal account. but when I try to withdraw, it says the funds are unavailable. 

A few questions,

1) The buy never left feedback, but got the item over a week ago, is this why it's taking so long to be able to withdraw?

2) if I were to buy an item on eBay, could I use the funds in my PayPal account (the funds i can not withdraw to my bank account, yet appears in my PayPal account) to pay for an item?

Those are the only questions I have right now, hope someone can help

Ebay,"Sold an iPhone over eBay, four weeks after I shipped it (and got funds) buyer tells me the item arrived cracked and wants a refund.  I don't have the money anymore, anything I can do?","He has also now opened a case against me after previously having contacted me through a message. When he contacted me I called FedEx with whom I shipped the phone (btw it was shipped in those special iPhone boxes and all don't know how the hell that would break during transit) and they told me they would send someone to evaluate to see if they can kick in the insurance on it (I put a 200 dollar value on it). 

Anyways point being there's now a case open against me on eBay and I've heard no word from FedEx what can I do! Is it possible to just delete my eBay account or will that cause further issues?

Ebay,URGENT!,"Hi Reddit!
I just won a case on eBay, and they want me to ship the item back with tracking to the US (I'm from Canada) before I get my money back. There were two items, only one came as described. I asked for a partial refund, and have contacted the member multiple times without any help.
I don't want to lose my money, but don't want to gamble.

Ebay,I think I just payed for a counterfeit camera...,"I'm kinda freaking out a little bit here, I've been saving up to buy a camera, and found what I thought to be a good deal on ebay. The seller had over 30,000 reviews, seemed trustworthy. So I bought, and payed for the camera this morning.

A few hours later, I get an call from an unknown New York number (I live in kansas) but I missed the call because I was in the shower. I called them back, and it was the seller I bought the camera from on ebay. I had to go through a touchtone process, and the first time I called, it said the mail box was full. So i tried a different extension. I got ahold of a guy, he didn't seem very professional, he answered with just ""hello"". He then tells me that no one called me.

I decide to look up the reviews of this seller on other sites, and was shocked with the number of awful reviews they had. They had been accused of selling counterfeit cameras, false upgrades, everything you can think of, and there were a good number of reviews.

here's a link to their reviews, the name of the company is ""getitdigital""

Second:
Since I am setup for the monthly payment thing, does it wait till the end of the listing or charges you directly when it starts. My listing(s) end on the 2nd day of May so I will have time to get payed and everything.

Ebay,Do I put in a dispute claim? - time is running out,"I ordered a full tracksuit (top and bottom) over 5 weeks ago. I got the top after a week and emailed the seller that I was missing the bottom. He was pretty non-apologetic about it when he finally responded and said he would take care of it. 

A couple of weeks later (a month after I ordered both) I emailed him again and he said he had been busy and would order the pants now. He has since then gone on 'holiday mode'. I realised that I need to put a dispute in by the 5th of May if this is going to go wrong. I emailed him telling him this and he got back to me saying that 'he is in holiday mode and he has already ordered my pants'. 

By the looks of it he has only sent the top to other buyers who bought the same set. Should I put a dispute in or just hope he eventually comes through. Also - if I put in negative feedback can he then put him negative feedback as revenge, messing up my reputation?",16,2,2012-04-30,EBAY,0.22569304704666138,0.743542492389679,0.030764475464820862

I bought this and thought I struck gold, normally the figures are $15 for one. From the pic, they seem good enough. It was until I pried the seller a bit (2 messages) that s/he admitted that they were knockoffs.

My question is: Can I justify that this was misleading? is this covered under buyer protection? 
The seller only does exchange or store-credit. Just sending it back to the seller would cost me 8-10 dollars. Even then, I'd only get credit for this store that I have to intention of continuing any business. Can I get him to pay for return shipping and issue a partial refund?
