Ebay,Just figured I'd share my latest ridiculous selling experience...,"I had a buyer do a return request claiming shorts she bought weren't as described. Her message said that they weren't the size I put on the ad... even though the tag on the shorts says so. She literally admitted that in her message! If the listing and the shorts both say the same size, how is it my fault if they don't fit you? Especially when I even provided a measurement chart in the pictures because I knew these type of shorts (spandex) don't fit like normal shorts. Anyway, then she adds something else (probably because she realized she was full of it!) stating there was also lint all over the shorts. I look at the ""proof"" she posted and it's a giant brown furball laying on top of the shorts. Let's just say for now that definitely wasn't shipped like that.

SO I message her back stating the description and listing was not inaccurate and the shorts were clean when shipped. Of course since I didn't accept the return, I get negative feedback. She says in it that I'm a ""rude seller"" and that I sent her ""shorts covered in cat hair"".

This is the best part. I don't even have a cat. I'm allergic. And when I click on her profile, guess what I see? Her icon is a picture... of her brown cat!",20,20,2017-04-01,EBAY,0.24137593805789948,0.7320648431777954,0.026559222489595413
Ebay,Why it's always important to be professional whether you are the buyer or seller,"I bought a digital item from a seller, and the seller sent an already redeemed code. I asked for my money back and the seller said no and that I had already used it, which I did not. So I left negative feedback and the seller said he will send me a bill for lost sales (which from a legal standpoint, is BS because that is hypothetical) and that he will sue me. Keep in mind, this is over a digital code worth less than $10 USD.

I called eBay about this, and while they can't directly help me because it is a digital code and he sent it over email rather than through eBay messages, they said that I shouldn't worry about the legal threat because I did not use any profanity in my messages and I only left honest negative feedback and replied to his messages mostly respectively. I say mostly because the worst I said was ""Real mature"" when he went on a tangent like a 5 year old.

Anyways, my point is that buyers and/or sellers will be immature, and if you act professional then people will always be on your side.",7,15,2017-04-01,EBAY,0.08072780817747116,0.8900902271270752,0.029182003811001778

However, if the transaction is ineligible for PayPal Seller Protection, PayPal will assess you with a chargeback fee (for facilitating the chargeback process) regardless of whether the buyer is successful in pursuing the chargeback with the card issuer. The applicable chargeback fee will be deducted from your PayPal account. The chargeback fee is $20 for transactions in U.S. Dollars, or the equivalent in the currency of the original transaction if the transaction is not in U.S. Dollars. Foreign currency equivalents for the chargeback fee can be found on the Chargeback Fees table.

Ebay,Listing removed after being paid for by 4 people,"Hi,

just the other day my listing got removed for violating ""Medical and Prescription Items"" policy due to the ingredients that, when dispensed in the United States, require a prescription from a licensed practitioner (such as a doctor, dentist, veterinarian, or optometrist).

However 4 buyers did already pay for the item and the money are currently being on hold in my PayPal account (they have always been on hold, I'm pretty new to eBay - this is not an issue).

I've emailed all 4 buyers explaining them the situation and the fact that I'm still willing to ship the goods.

1) Would I be better off by just refunding all of them assuming they can open dispute at any point and get (win) their money back?

2) Assuming I get a confirmation via email that they won't open a dispute, should I go ahead with the shipping?

3) Won't the PayPal refund the money automatically somehow?

4) What happens to the eBay fees in case I refund all 4 buyers?

Ebay,Buyer filed INAD because batteries he put in blew up and ruined item,"Hi all. I am so frustrated I hope someone can help me. I shipped out an expensive digital alarm clock/CD player to someone for $85. The clock shipped with generic batteries in it from the manufacturer. They day he received the item, he sent me a message through ebay saying ""The clock doesn't work, I tried everything, I even put new batteries in it"". Then a few minutes later before I replied he sent me an email saying ""Nevermind, I was putting the batteries in the wrong way! It works now"". So flash forward 8 days, and he sends me another message and says that the clock stopped working and he opened the battery case and one of the batteries had exploded inside, leaking acid everywhere and ruining the battery compartment. He said it no longer works and he wants a refund. I politely replied to him that he said the clock was working and it worked for 8 days, and that the batteries that exploded were batteries HE put in (not the ones that came with it). I also pointed out he put the batteries in wrong and maybe damaged something although I don't see how that would happen. He replied back to me and he tried to blame the manufacturer. He said he put the batteries in backwards because the batteries were in backwards from the manufacturer to begin with, so he just copied what he saw. Therefore, it's the manufacturers fault he put the batteries in. After this email he opened up an INAD case.

Basically I am wondering what my chances are here. I feel bad his clock is broken but I am no expert, but it sounds like batteries that explode are bad batteries. When I asked him how old the batteries were, he never answered. He also doesn't seem to be responding to my messages anymore. I have copies of his emails where he says batteries blew up. I don't see how this can possibly be an INAD.

Ebay,I think an item I won was being shill bid on to drive price up. How do I move forward?,"First please allow me to say I'm open to the idea that I'm paranoid and would like perspective.

There were some trading cards for a game I play that I've been looking for in a certain language.  There were 3 copies and they'd normally go for about $5-$10 a piece. I'd initially bid $30 and someone bid me up to $20 then stopped.  I decided I really wanted these and placed a max bid of $60.  Then right before the auction someone else started bidding:

They bid 

* $23.50
* 25
* 29.03
* 30
* 32.03
* 35
* 37
* 39.04
* 42
* 44.05
* 47
* 49.05

And then stopped. 

This buyer's stats show:

* Bids on this item:	 12
* Bid activity (%) with this seller:	 10%	 
* **Bid retractions:	 85**
* **#Bid retractions (6 months):	 924**

Seems like a lot of bid retractions and questionable since I think I'm the only person who'd want this in this language so bad b/c it's part of a weird project I'm working on.

Thoughts?  I didn't see a good path to report this to ebay for investigation.  I'm going to ahead and pay b/c I do want the cards but the idea that I paid more than double market value due to shill bidding is frustrating.  I'd post a link but I think that's against the rules.

Incidentally it seems that the only other item I bid on of his this other mystery buyer also outbid me on and was the last bid.

Ebay,Two different tracking numbers for same package?,"Apologies if this is more of a USPS question than an eBay one, but I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar when printing shipping labels on eBay. 

I printed out the shipping label at home for a medium sized flat rate shipping box with insurance and tracking at home. I went to my local post office and picked up and packed my item in the medium box, and when I handed the worker my box he scanned and attached my label that I printed at home. He gave me a receipt that he told me had my tracking number on it. 

When I got home, I checked eBay and saw that the tracking number was already uploaded into eBay, which makes sense because I bought the shipping label through eBay using PayPal. But when I looked at the receipt I got, it had an entirely different tracking number. The weird thing is, when I plug in the each number into the usps website, both numbers have the exact same progress for the package, and both show that the package was dropped off at the same time at my local post office. 

My question is, should I just keep the one tracking number available now to the buyer on eBay, or should I upload the second one I was given on the receipt as well? Will this possibly effect my seller protection/insurance? Should I contact usps? Or should I just ignore it?

Thanks for any help!

I'm so disappointed in eBay right now. The buyer decided to return a brand new ps4 game he bought from me 20 days after he got it because it was scratched. I right away knew it was bullshit but I had no choice but to send him a return label so he can ship it back to me. When I got the package, the only thing inside was a PlayStation 3 game disk. I right away took photos of the package and the game. I uploaded them on to the eBay case and stated that I won't give a refund because I didn't get the original game that I have sent. Thats when ebay stepped in and decided the buyer would be refunded. This is the email I got. 

&gt; We reviewed this case and decided to issue the buyer a full refund.
We understand that you received your item in a different condition than when you shipped it, but unfortunately we couldn't determine that this was caused by the buyer, or that this was something in the buyer's control.
A refund of $53.00 was issued on Apr 8, 2017 to the buyer. The refund includes the purchase price plus original shipping.
This amount will be debited from the payment method on your account.

He asked for me to understate the price on shipping, he sent dozens of messages asking for assurances on the customs details before I shipped the item, numerous emails asking when the tracking information would update, and then dozens more during the period where it was delayed in transit. He asked for a refund about a week before it came (which is not necessarily unreasonable given the amount of time it ended up taking). Now he's opened another case asking for a refund because the controller is missing.

The photos look convincing, but given the strange history of communication, I'm inclined to doubt them slightly. Is there any good route to take here?",8,5,2017-04-08,EBAY,0.04269963875412941,0.8918872475624084,0.06541313976049423
Ebay,Can a Canadian seller give me some information on paying taxes?,"Hey guys, I starting selling on eBay recently by importing items from china and selling them from my house in Canada and its grown pretty well in these past 2 months.

My issue is that a I'm full time student who has never had a job before so you can say that I have absolutely 0 knowledge on taxes. 

Up to now I have just been transferring the money from paypal to my checking account or buying more product with my paypal.

I know nothing about income tax, how to pay it, when to pay it, or know how much I should be making.

 If I did $2000 in sales last month and on track for $4000 this month, should I be worrying about taxes or should I wait a couple more months to see if my sales are even stable?

Ebay,Buying messages asking for a refund as item hasn't shipped in 2 days. Auction clearly states item ships w/i 3 business days. What to do?,"I have been selling on eBay since January and have perfect feedback  currently. A buyer purchased an item from me on April 5th at 10PM. I work 12 hour shifts and generally do not have time to run to the post office the next day so I set all my eBay auctions to ""Will usually ship within 3 business days of receiving cleared payment""

The customer contacted me on ebay messenger on the 2nd business day and asked if they would get an email notification with a tracking number. I explained they would, however the item hasn't shipped yet due to a busy work schedule, and the auction terms were set to ships within 3 business days and I would have it shipped by the 3rd business day. I let her know I would have a tracking number uploaded into ebay as soon as the item was shipped.

Today, Saturday, the customer messages me around midnight stating ""I called the eBay customer service and they said to contact you for a refund. 

Thank you""

Nothing else.

Maybe they don't realize Saturday is not a business day? Is it wrong to ship the item on the third business day and upload the tracking number into ebay? I feel like I haven't done anything wrong yet.

Ebay,Buyer trying to get partial refund 6 months after purchase,"A buyer purchased a guitar from me and I had it shipped overseas to him. He received the item and with no complaints. Two months later he came accusing me with harassing language saying I ripped him off. 

His argument was that the pickup of the guitar wasn't as advertised, and a whole slew of others minor complaints (Again 2 months later). I honestly thought and was sure it was the pickup I advertised in the guitar. But in the very unreasonable chance it wasn't, the pickup he's saying it came with is of near equal value anyway. (EMG 81 compared to EMG HZ for any guitar players on here). I didn't send a guitar box filled with rocks, which is what he's making it out to sound like. It was a solid and well-crafted instrument. 

Both eBay and PayPal dismissed the case. Now, 6 MONTHS later he managed to message me on eBay (I don't know why eBay didn't block him, I reported him at the time). He says he's still waiting for a replacement for the pickup which is priced at $120 and isn't going to stop and again, accused me of ripping him off.

Ebay,"Shipped an item first class, as advertised, have proof of delivery, buyer tried to get refund saying it never arrived and left a neg. how to get it expunged?","I sold a PS4 game (BF1) for $22 on eBay. As advertised, I shipped it first class which does not include insurance (not that it would matter.)

I corrected myself a day later when he said the post office says there was not insurance. He then got angry and opened a case saying I ""had to ship with insurance"" (I didn't advertise a service that has insurance) and that he never received the item expire my tracking proof. I had many conversations with him in which he was unreasonable and unreceptive of the fact that I'm not on the hook for it.

Ebay,Is there any advice on how to handle the refunding process when you’re sent something counterfeit?,"I’ve recently received something I can prove is counterfeit, and I’m looking for advice on how to handle getting a refund.

Basically, I ordered a Warhammer kit from an Italian seller and was sent a counterfeit reproduction of the original kit. I’ve got a set of the original kit on hand so I can prove that the kit I received is not genuine.

I started what I thought was refund process on eBay citing that the item is not as described, with photographic evidence to prove the kit is not genuine, but it turns out it’s an item return process? I’ve received a message from eBay that “the seller accepted your return“ and that “the seller can’t send a postage label”.

I’m concerned that I’m not going to be fully reimbursed (for the item, for the shipping costs to have it sent to me, and for the shipping costs to ship it back) or that the seller is going try and pull something shady and I won’t get a refund.

Is there any advice on how I should proceed?

*Edit:*

If anyone's coming back to this thread, or finding it through search or whatever, I can't really say there was any meaningful advice to come from this.

After a few messages back and forth with the seller they refused to pay the shipping costs and I refused to accept a partial refund, I warned them that I would escalate the issue and the seller simply gave me a full refund without requiring the counterfeit kit returned to them.

Only one problem. There is no package. Anywhere.

Ebay,"eBay Shipping Nightmare - Loss of Sale, Wrong Address - eBay Seller vs. The Bad Buyer","Hello everyone - I hope your all enjoying the change of weather - I certainly am!

So I wanted to bounce a idea off all of you and see if anyone else has run into this issue on eBay/PayPal

We had a buyer purchase an item for $50. Item ships out to the buyer - all is well.

About 12 days later the buyer messages us and asks us where their purchase is. 

I look into the tracking and find the package was not deliverable due to the incorrect address. The new homeowners refused delivery as they don't know who the buyer is and thus the package was en-route to be returned to us. Buyer has contacted us 24 hours before the package was due to be delivered back to us - even though the entire time this was going on the carrier has been attempting to call the buyer to schedule a pick up (buyer never calls carrier or makes contact otherwise).

So I relay this info to the buyer.

Buyer admits they have the wrong address posted on both their order, eBay account, and PayPal account and that now their is a new address which is (insert address here) and please can we ship the package to this new address.

I told the buyer we can certainly ship the package to the new address but first I need to contact eBay and I would get her a new shipping quote since she would have to pay for the second shipment. Buyer says okay. 

So I call up eBay and they explain that the address cannot be changed, the buyer would need to repurchase with the correct address. Or cancel the sale and refund the buyer.

Now here is the kicker to all this nonsense. 

We LOST money on this sale. Yup. Cost to ship was $52.00. But as good eBay sellers we ship anyways and take the loss. Buyer just happens to live off continental USA.

I explain to eBay the shipping loss - and ask if it is we are allowed to deduct the shipping cost from the refund amount. eBay agrees with us - and they approve this - on eBay. 

My concern here is that 

A.) The buyer will not want to pay double for this product which they can purchase for the same $50 with free shipping from any other eBay seller. Buyer will most likely ask to cancel the sale.

B.) Buyer will open a PayPal dispute once they loose the eBay claim. 

I did call PayPal and explained all this to them. I asked what they would allow us to do - I was given a vague answer that they would need to wait until a claim was filed to answer me  - but for now follow eBay's suggestions. 

Anyone ever had the extreme pleasure of being in this type of nightmare? What was the outcome?

Ebay,Question about Ebay bucks going negative,"Hello all, I have spoken to Ebay directly on this a few times and they just keep telling me they will escalate and get back which never happens.

I purchased 2 items in march, both ~$300 mark. Both purchased during 10% promo earning ~$30 apiece in bucks. One item was returned and refunded by 3/31 but somehow still wound up on my bucks cert a week later. The 2nd item was also returned but after the cert was issued.

I've never been in this position before but I know that the bucks rewards are not mine so I looked up what happens and sure enough you go negative during the next period for returned items. Well what is not clear is how to avoid this from happening. I've looked on the Ebay board and people claim they go negative without even spending their certficiates which is alarming to me. Going negative $60 and having to climb out at 1% is $6000 in purchases which wont be happening. I have not spent any of my bucks at this time. The other issue is part of the certificate is legit mine outside this $60 (total is higher amount) but trapped together with the $60. 

I'm scared to sit idle and not spend it and see myself go negative anyways. I'm scared to spend it and go negative because I did spend it. I don't want to lose my portion that I know is good to go as well. If anyone can shed some light on this for me and clear up if you indeed do go negative for unspent balances or not, or if just leaving the amount alone will cancel it out and I wont see a negative balance.

Ebay,Settling dispute via Paypal Resolution center?,"Hi. 

A buyer messaged me via eBay that the iPhone that I sold him had a ""cracked screen"" instead of the ""scratched"" screen that I described in the listing. He told me to refund him 30 dollars or he will file a claim. I called eBay before he filed any claim and the told me that I should be okay because within the eBay messages that the buyer sent me he admitted that he altered the item after he recieved it by repairing it himself for 30 dollars (which is what he is demanding from me) and also becuase he used a shipping forwarding service to forward the item to Russia from the US. Now, all of the incriminating evidence against the buyer is present in the eBay messages exchanged between us, but instead of filing a Item Not as Described claim through eBay, the buyer filed a claim through PAYPAL. Now, it pops up that I can either pay the buyer 30 dollars or escalate the claim to paypals dispute resolution service, but I'm afraid that since the claim was filed through paypal instead of eBay, paypal won't be able to access the messages sent by the buyer admitting he altered the item (which makes him lose buyer protection.) What should I do, escalate the claim to paypal and try to provide evidence, or will they be unable to view the eBay messages and then rule against me?",6,2,2017-04-11,EBAY,0.05569696053862572,0.9162319302558899,0.0280710868537426

Ebay,"Said item was broken, accepted return, item is fine","I normally do not accept returns. I have my listings set up as such and have not had a return request in years. I had a brand new 0 feedback buyer buy an electronic handheld game from me that they claimed did not work upon arrival and opened a return request. I have pictures in the listing of the game working fine. They even said they bought new batteries but it still didn't work. I figured maybe something got jostled wrong in transit and maybe it really did stop working. Despite not accepting returns, I decided to be nice about it and accept the return, on the assumption that buyer would pay to ship it back. Cool, did NOT realize until after I accepted that I would have to pay to ship it back. Got the item back, put batteries in it, and it works fine. I know I can resell it but I'm upset I had to pay to ship something back to me that was clearly fine and most likely a case of buyers remorse.

Ebay,do i have no recourse until the expected shipping date goes by?,"i ordered something from japan just under 4 weeks ago. the seller seems to be a legitimate and well rated seller. he has several hundred positive ratings, no negatives, and several stores across several sites. all with the same positive reviews. he has also been very on top of trying to figure this issue out with me, through our language barrier. 

the problem is that my item hasnt been scanned since mid-late march. its been 3 entire weeks since its last *scan.*let alone since it was initially accepted into the mailing facility. its just said ""origin post is getting ready to ship"" since then.

the seller told me it usually takes 2-3 weeks for his stuff to reach the US, yet some reason the shipping arrival date is set for the end of May on ebay...which is a hell of a lot more than 3 weeks starting from my mid march purchase date.

late May would make it 2 entire months after the initial purchase. when i went to file a international case for a ""missing package"" it told me i had to wait until it was passed the expected shipping date... another 5-6 weeks from now. 

ive called the USPS distribution center in my area, customs in my area... the seller has called japan post... no one seems to know where the hell the package is.

Ebay,When to leave not-positive feedback?,"Long time eBay user, and I understand that leaving negative (or even neutral?) feedback can have a detrimental effect on sellers - in fact in over 15 years I don't think I've ever done it. How damaging is a negative or neutral to people, really?

Recently I've had a couple of buying experiences that made me think about leaving poor feedback. In both cases these were cheap items not worth getting upset about, and I don't want to cause anyone a disproportionate effect for their mistakes, but I also feel like if you never complain about things people will continue to do stupid things to other buyers, and then there's no point having a feedback system at all.

I bought a used but tested+working computer hard drive which arrived loose in only a jiffy bag and unsurprisingly did not work after the postage ordeal. Seller refunded straight away, but I feel like that's not the point. . . you don't send fragile items with lousy packaging, so I wouldn't buy from them again.

Another seller sent me an old video game with one of the discs missing (leaving the game unplayable), and so far their only response has been that they can't find the other disc and I should download a no-cd crack (legally dubious).

Ebay,"If seller wins appeal in a dispute, what happens to the buyer's refund?","Let's say a buyer got into dispute with a seller over a $600 item. The buyer filed SNAD claim, and after returning the product to the seller, eBay decided in buyer's favor and refunded $600 (out of the seller's pocket, of course).

Seller is not happy with this resolution, and files an appeal. Somehow he wins the appeal and get the $600 back.

Now what happens? The $600, does it come from the buyer (so now the buyer is out of the $600 refund), or does it come from eBay itself (eBay reimburses the seller out of eBay's own pocket, while letting the buyer keeping the initial $600 refund) ?",7,4,2017-04-15,EBAY,0.03277626633644104,0.8972906470298767,0.06993309408426285

Ebay,Was this a scam attempt? Or was it just unlucky coincidence?,"I sold a used nexus 5x phone on ebay, but have been having a few problems with the seller. The problem is, a lot of what he is saying/asking help for seems reasonable, but I took a step back and it sounds a little suspicious. Maybe it's scamming, or maybe this really is just a series of unfortunate events. 

First, the package was missing. I sent a package through UPS, and it said delivered, but he requested for a refund saying the package was missing. He didn't really push for the refund, but he did say that it was nowhere to be found. I told him maybe UPS lost it, but it was not my responsibility at that point. The next day, he finds the package. I haven't asked him where it was or how he found it.

I reset the android phone before I sent it, but did not know that if you don't have a sim card when setting the phone up, you need an old email/password that was on the phone before. When he emailed me about this, he showed pictures of each step in trying to set up, leading to needing the account information. He even tells me that I can set up a temporary password for a while so he can just quickly set up, and then I can switch the password back. I did this, gave him the info (which I should not have done), emphasizing how uncomfortable I was with all of this. 

The problem with this though, and something that I did not know, when you change your password, you have to wait 24 hours before you can setup the phone! He emails me about this, and asks me to keep the temporary password for 24 hours. I immediately change it back to a secure password. 

After looking online, it looks like you can bypass this WHOLE thing if you install it with a SIM card, but when I told him that, he said the sim card tray was missing.

Now here is my thoughts playing devils advocate.

1. The missing package? Might have been him just being sincere. This does not seem to be too uncommon of a problem with UPS.

2. Him needing my account to set up the phone? This is where it gets suspicious. He did not tell me the sim card was missing until after I bring it up myself. BUT, he also did ask me to hold the password for 24 hours, instead of just stealing my account right away. This is why I am so confused. Any real scammer would not have told me that info, as it would instantly set off red flags. Luckily the email that given was not connected to anything financial, but it was connected to a few social media accounts. I am monitoring all of my bank/business accounts right now.",11,3,2017-04-15,EBAY,0.10009324550628662,0.871430516242981,0.02847626991569996

Ebay,Seeking Advice: Buyer Unhappy with used DVD condition. Should I refund without receiving item?,"Hello, I sold a used DVD (I set the condition as ""Acceptable"") and the buyer messaged me (one day after receiving the disc) asking to return the DVD saying it wasn't in pristine condition and that the disc is damaged. I messaged them back saying that I never described it as being pristine but I did list it as ""Acceptable"" (but I didn't add anything extra in product details) and that it should still be playable. I asked how is it damaged. They replied back saying that the condition of the DVD and case was not at all what they expected and there's a scratch that's preventing it from being played and it skips while watching the movie.

I pop in usually all of my CDs and DVDs to check before I list them and I don't recall this being an issue with this particular movie but I didn't let the whole thing play. 

The buyer has a feedback score of under 10 and they haven't left feedback for others. I have a feedback score of over 500. The disc itself shipped was under $8. The buyer didn't ask for a refund yet but definitely wants to return the disc and is asking for my return address (even though its the original address on the ebay shipping label).

The buyer has not opened an Item As Not Described case.

Should I send them a return label for them to ship the disc back to me? Should I refund them and if so, should I do it after I receive the DVD or just let them keep it? 

It's not a high priced item and I've been selling all my DVDs as I'll be moving in a few months and want less to have to bring with me. 

I'm curious what most sellers here would do. I'm trying to minimize the headache but I also don't want buyers running wild (but then again maybe that's eBay for you).

Ebay,Got sniped like an idiot on one of a pair of items from the same seller and kicking myself for it,"I'm not expecting to be able to do anything other than suck it up and pay for the now overpriced item I did win of course. But my god I'm so furious at myself. I've watched listings for these items for weeks and if I'd bid last week, I would have won both as there was no competition, but I was going to be out of town so I decided to wait like the stupid idiot I am. These listings were relisted and other bidders showed up.

I went up as high as I did on the first item because getting combined shipping would have brought the item total down on the pair. I had the high bid on the second for a few minutes and got lulled into a false sense of security. I also thought wrongly that someone else entering a bid would extend the bidding time by a few seconds since I distinctly remember getting frustrated and giving up on an auction not that long ago when I was trying to up the bid and another bidder wouldn't quit, and the time kept being extended. I thought it was annoying then but man now I wish they hadn't changed it.

Now that I'm only getting one, and have to get the other half from another seller, I'm eating two shipping charges. They're fragile, somewhat heavy items that need to be packed well so the shipping isn't cheap. What's worse is that I know the item I won has a flaw, which the seller was evasive about when I asked, but I let it go because I thought I could live with it if I got the pair for a reasonable price. 

It might be a good thing in the end. I'm working on a collection so I'm likely spending too much time and money on eBay lately. Perhaps this sour experience and the hit to my collecting budget will put me off it for a couple months. 

What I learned:

Don't bid on two items ending at the same time, it's too hard to keep track  
Don't ever assume you'll win (Corollary: Never underestimate how annoying other people can be)  
Bid the most you're willing to pay not the least you want to pay  
Don't wait too long for a ""deal"", if it's a fair price then buy it  
Bid on mobile not the computer if time is of the essence

The buyer has been on eBay since 2015 but only has feedback for 28 items.

I looked and the address is a warehouse district

I couldn't find ANY information on what GTG means in an address or anything about Princesslondon so that set off red flags.

Ebay,Small ebay rant,"I got scammed, and was 100% at fault. Fell for the old 'Pictured item is not what will be shipped, what will be shipped is literal garbage.'

I submitted, and of course, lost the case. It was, after all, stated so in the middle of a wall of unintelligible text, surrounded by quality assurance bullshit. I got what I agreed to.

So I called their number, expecting to wait an hour on hold. It was 8PM EST, probably peak time for them.

I waited 5 minutes. I stuttered on the phone, saying I knew I screwed up. I expected them to go by the book -- if it says, it goes -- Written so in a guide that operators regurgitate word-for-word every evening.

What I got was a human perspective. The woman on the line said, 'Yeah, this was an intent to scam.' I had a message from Paypal 5 minutes later, stating I got a refund.

Ebay,Buyer is retaliating by leaving bad feedback for not giving free items,"Fair warning, this is long.

I have a buyer who has been purchasing large quantities of items from me for well over a year at a frequency or 4-15 orders a month with quantities ranging from 4-6 per order and shipping the orders to New Jersey. The items are a powder inside a sealed bag. 

The issue at hand is the fact that this buyer will contact us a week or so (longest was 24 days) after receiving the package claiming that one of the items were damaged and would like a replacement. At first, I thought that maybe it was the way we were packaging the shipments and sent a replacement immediately. After half a year of just sending replacements over and over, I began trying to figure out why this is happening as out of the hundreds of orders made per month, this buyer is THE ONLY one getting damaged on arrival. I have been getting frustrated as I don't know if this buyer is simply damaging the bag, sending a picture and then draining the powder into another bag. As of January this year, I have been shipping with FedEx Priority Overnight which is 1 business day shipping and loads better in handling standards than USPS Priority.

I assumed that the shipping service change would finally fix the issue and it seemed like it was the case, at first, as the first 4 shipments to this buyer, there were no complaints. Then they started up again. No changes were made in how I pack these shipments. I have shipped the same exact orders to other buyers with no complaints. I decided I had enough of sending free stuff. I sent a return shipping label and asked for the buyer to ship the item back so we can inspect the damage and send a replacement. The response threw me off.

Buyer (Summarized): ""I am located in South Korea so there's no way of shipping back the package.""

So I looked up the address I have been shipping these orders to and it goes to a shipping company. I believe he is having these orders shipped to a shipping company and then having this company re-ship the package to the buyer. This would explain why it takes so long for the customer to notify us of any damage that has happened and why they are unable to send back the damaged product.

I explained that we need the package returned before we can send a replacement. The buyer then proceeded to continue with their orders and made 7 more orders within 2 weeks. The buyer left 5x Neutral feedbacks with a statement basically thanking for fast shipping. I contacted the buyer asking what the neutral's were for (sort of obvious though) and have yet to receive a response.

So after no response, I contact eBay (oh boy). I explained the above and they review all the messages. To summarize the conversation, they cannot remove the feedback as it's the buyer's opinion and have to follow guidelines. I explained that this buyer is punishing me for not sending the buyer free stuff when they are damaging the packages. I'm afraid to block the buyer as I fear they will leave a few more negatives (3 more orders were shipped yesterday).

What else can I do? I don't want to deal with the buyer but I also don't want to have negative feedback because of this buyer's poor handling shipping company.",11,4,2017-04-19,EBAY,0.15083320438861847,0.819239616394043,0.029927177354693413

Ebay,"Buyer left negative feedback that item does not work, even though he bought wrong one","I sell TV replacement parts. In order to buy a compatible part, you need to match the part number on your original board to the part number in my title and description. I have that clearly listed in the description in red sentence with pictures. 

Buyer bought an item, then messaged me via eBay that item is defective. I have asked him to send me a picture of his original board. He did. I have responded back to him that the reason why the board does not work is because they are not compatible with each other as they contain different part numbers. He left me a negative feedback claiming I have send him defective item. Because of that I no longer have 100% feedback.  After few emails back and forth him insisting they are the same, even thought the picture he has sent me clearly shows otherwise, I have send him the following image: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzJJ7wVBvD2Xc3MwNTFMTmNBem8. No response since then

I have contacted eBay with that information and they stated that they cannot remove the feedback, even though I have showed them the evidence, as sent to my by the buyer. They stated that only way I would win this case and get the feedback removed is if the buyer would open a return case, which he did not. I wonder why. So even though I have all I need to prove my case, they won't do anything since the buyer did not request to return the item. That is stupid.

Does anyone know if there is a different approach I can try to get the feedback booted?
Thanks

Ebay,Burned by a prepaid phone refill seller,"I just got a pretty big shock while trying to refill my prepaid phone with my debit card. I was referred to the fraud department and told that a stolen card had been used last year to refill my account. I was shocked and confused until I remembered I had bought a refill from a seller on eBay back in June of last year. So that seller used a stolen card to refill my account while having me believe they used a refill card. To explain more these sellers take your cell phone number and refill it for the amount you pay them on your behalf. Stupid on my part to trust them I guess.

Now the phone company wants me to give them the money they had to reimburse the person who had their info stolen back. They did say that they have been having issues with these ebay sellers scamming people but they still need their money back. I am so angry. I paid the seller and they screwed not only me but the person who had their info stolen. Is there anything I can do to get this seller off of eBay? Is it worth contacting eBay about at all?

Ebay,eBay Money Back ~ will I succeed?,"Dear redditers,

I bought a refurbrished laptop on eBay. (1000+USD) The seller's description doesn't say much so I asked about the condition before I made purhcase. I got a fast and brief reply that the laptop is **""in like new condition with no cosmetic issues""**.

However, after arrival:

- laptop has noticably wobbly base
- display is misalignend and leaves black ~ 2px wide vertical strip next to the right bezel.
- space key is not backlit

I am considering to issue a case with eBay Money Back Guarantee. I would like to get my shipping cost back since the international shipping was pricy as well.

I paid by credit card, which shouldn't be a problem.

- The seller has very high ratings ~ 100% good reviews.
- I paid by credit card.
- I bought from US. Shipped to South East Asia.

What are my chances as a buyer? Is the brief response about the state of the laptop enough to support my case?

Ebay,How to deal with people who call you?,"I sold a cordless phone with a charging cradle to a user with 0 feedback and a new account. It was an expansion set and I listed it as such. So yesterday I get a call from this guy saying I sent him the wrong base and it doesn't have a place to plug in a phone line. I sent him exactly what he ordered. I have a base, but it was under a separate listing which he did not order. After I received the massage on my voice mail, I sent him a message through the eBay system saying I do not handle issues over the phone and asking him to restate the problem in a message. This morning I get another message from him on my voice mail saying basically the same thing. I'm willing to send him the base as long as he returns the charging cradle and pays for shipping, but if he opens a return for wrong item sent or INAD I'll be screwed.

Why does eBay let buyers call sellers? I refuse to handle disputes over the phone as there's no record of anything said. This is the third time something like this has happened in a year.

6 April. I paid $1400 for 2 iPhones from U.K. Seller with 8k+ feedback(about 98.7%)
Seller told me that ups ship to Russia only to companies and said that he gonna be using new shipping company and for that he need to send a test package, because cost is high. I complained about it because I ordered it as a gift and choose it seller because in his listing was written that I will got item between 11 and 19 April. 

Then he told me that he shipped my package(I think he was talking about phones) but waiting for tracking number. So at 19th April he marked it shipped and linked a tracking number. Tracking shows that it has been sent on 13 April. 

Today I checking tracking number and it shows that it already in Russia(yay!) BUT! It shows that it weight only 236grams! As far as I know 2 iPhone 7 should weight about 700gramms(phone+box) without shipping company box. I started worrying.

After that I wrote seller about it(wait for answer) and went to check its feedback. He works from '04, 8000+ feedbacks. Selling mostly cheap stuff like clothes(3-15 pounds price) and sometimes iPhones. Most feedbacks are positive, 23 negative in 12 months and most of them about phones.

So I turned to Ebay. At first I listed as an auction but got a lot of scammer offers, asking me to respond by text over the cell phone. I asked them to communicate through email instead but they never answered. Soon I had enough and decided to relist as a buy it now option. I naively selected a make offer choice as well and now my problem is that people keep sending me offers for either more money than the buy it now option, making me think its an obvious scam. Or they simply wont answer my messages.

My question is simply about my safety as a seller. If these were scammers what would they try to achieve with this? If I choose accept offer on one what will happen? Will they be required to pay, and if they cant will my listing disappear? If I send my paypal email link will they somehow be able to exploit that information? 

Take note that these are always accounts made the same day or the day before the offer was given. I dont like to call scammer just because of that but it always leaves me suspicious.

Ebay,My eBay account was hacked - have I done everything necessary to protect myself going forward?,"Unknown how account was hacked, eBay couldn't tell me.  Am intending to prod them a bit further and find out if the person involved had my (unique, randomly generated, and long) password, or social engineered their way in. 

Anyway, hack happened while asleep and I had multiple fraudulent mobile phone listings go up and about 100 messages on my account from about ten users regarding these phones by the time I woke up the next day.  

From looking at my conversation history from the time of the hack, long, detailed correspondence was going on back and forth between my account and about ten other accounts about my fraudulent listings, but all the conversations were essentially identical.  There were about 100 items of correspondence in total, and all within the space of about an hour or so, so the pace was frantic. 

During this frantic hour of activity, my account also successfully had an offer of £1 accepted to purchase a mobile phone from one of the other (I assume also hacked) accounts that was messaging me, but this transaction was stopped by eBay.

My suspicion is that both parties in the conversation were the hacker, and the messages are to make any transactions look more legit to eBay.

I have an over 1,000 feedback score, so assuming this is why the account was targeted.

This was yesterday, and since then I rang eBay, who closed the fake listings and reset my password.  Someone (I assume the hacker) has since been messaging me on eBay on my genuine listings about the items, and also phoning, texting and WhatsApp-ing me on my mobile phone about one of the listings he claims I sold him.

So far I have:

- rang the police to report the crime, but they said the right department are only open Mon-Fri, so need to call back.  Intention here is that the hacker could have accessed my home address while in my eBay account.
- changed my password on eBay and Paypal using a very long randomly generated password (which it was before as well).
- changed the email account associated with eBay and PayPal, and changed PayPal password too.
- changed the eBay username for the account.
- changed my mobile phone number.
- revoked access to all (about 6-7) third party apps that had been authorised on the account since the hack by someone.
- Called eBay to stop the usernames of everyone who was messaging me during that frantic time, and the user who has been hassling me since, from being able to bid on any of my listings, and removed the listings that they have already used to contact me.  This will hopefully stop the messages, unless they resort to using other accounts I haven't seen yet to find my genuine listings and contact me through there.
- Have also tightened up my approved bidders settings by cutting out people from countries I don't ship to, those with negative feedback scores, and those who are winning on lots of my items at the same time.
- Then changed password again and ensured I was signed out from all other instances in eBay settings.

However, a few hours later, some third party apps have been re-authorised.  Is there something I'm missing?  I haven't activated 2FA but will do so.

In addition, what is this hacker trying to achieve?  Is this a known scam?

Putting up listings for items I don't have seems really odd, was it to test to see if they would work, and to then use my account to put up lots of other listings to genuine buyers to shift potentially stolen items?  Or simply to use contact through eBay to hassle me into paying him to leave me alone?",3,9,2017-04-23,EBAY,0.14953650534152985,0.8265618085861206,0.02390170469880104

Ebay,Want to sell my computer on eBay. How do I start?,"So, I've bought plenty of things on eBay with a Walmart credit card of my grandmothers that's connected to my PayPal account. I want to sell my desktop so I can purchase a laptop for when I start college in the fall. I'm not quite sure how to go about it. The biggest hurdle is that I remember when I wanted to sell something when I was like 12, but my social had to be verified (I couldn't verify it because I was under the age of 18, I know, I was retarded) and the card had to be verified with the account or something like that, but I'm confused because I don't know if that's required now or what I have to do with the bank account I plan on using. I'm worried about listing the computer on eBay and someone purchasing it because I don't know if I'll get the money or not as of now.

Well, when I officially turn 18 in may, my grandmother is going to take me to the bank so she can sign over my college fund account and get my a debit card that connects to it and I plan on putting that debit card on PayPal so I can sell my computer then.

Ebay,Old Suspended Account help?,"Back in 2015 I attempted to sell my first item on Ebay , but my fairly new account got suspended due to security concerns.

Being very frustrated at the time I went on to just make another account so i could simply continue buying items on ebay.

It's been nearly two years later though, and I'm still using this 2nd account i made. I've acquired 320 positive feed-backs, and with a bunch of items i don't need laying around I'm really considering attempting to sell some items again.

I'm concerned though the old suspended account could interfere with it, so i'm curious what is the best way to go about getting the suspension removed and possibly just removing the account completely? 

I thought about just contacting them, but I'm a little concerned by contacting them they might see i made a 2nd account and try to suspend it too. I also have a relative that i live with who has had an account for a LONG time before i ever had one, and i'd hate to think they would somehow try to mess with it just because we share the same address.

Ebay,Seller Shipped Package Month Late,"I bid and won an item on March 25 and immediately paid for it.

I opened a request and eBay told me that if the seller had not responded by April 20 to contact them. By April 21 the package had magically started being shipped and it is set to arrive tomorrow. Even if it does come tomorrow, is there any way to take action against the seller? Or is the only thing I can do is give a bad review? The seller never attempted to contact me through any of this.

Ebay,Can anomyone help discuss my complex case,"I am a student in United States and also a ebay seller. I sell my private used items on ebay like used motherboard and CPU. I listed my CPU and motherboard as a COMBO on Ebay last month. A buyer finally bought it and paid it on Mar 31. He asked me that is that combo working good before purchase. He also said he wanted to see more pictures. I replied him yes but I didn't add pictures because the COMBO was already taped inside the box. I told him the motherboard and cpu were working well. I did test the motherboard and CPU before I listed it. And it did work well.
Then I shipped the combo to his address on Apr 3. His address is in CA, U.S.
On Apr 6, the package was delievered to his address. And then I asked him for a positive feedback.
On Apr 9, he messaged me with Ebay and told me he is living outside U.S. He told me he would give a feedback after he received his items. I misunderstood his meaning. I thought he was not in U.S at that time and would be back to U.S soon.
Yesterday, he finally got his package. BUT! He is not in U.S!!! He said he is in his country Vietnam. The CA address is for freight transport, which means he personally shipped the items to his country without telling me. Now the motherboard has some problems that can't be solved.
I spent my whole morning after I woke up, from 7AM to 1PM in talking to him and trying my best to fix it, so that he doesn't need to ship it back to me. But finally we were unable to fix the motherboard's problem.
Eventually he requested for a refund from me. I said I am okay to refund all money. But then he said he won't and he can't ship it to me just for the refund because it costs too much money to ship it from his country to U.S.
Then I refused to refund jist because he wanted a refund without shipping back yhe items he bought.(Anyone thinks it is possoble to get any refund without returning the items?)

Ebay,Actually won eBay/PayPal cases as a seller,"Had a customer purchase diamond ring from me on eBay. After receiving it, she doesn't like the fit and initiates a return. Since fit counts as buyer's remorse, we inform her she's responsible for return shipping but to open a case through eBay and follow the instructions there.

Almost 2 weeks go by and no tracking has been uploaded, so I'm about to call eBay and have them close out the return when she starts sending Emails stating we have received it already and where's her refund? We never received the package and ask for tracking. She tells us to look it up on Google, as if that's possible.

We inform her that the tracking number should be on her receipt when she shipped it, which she (lucky for her) didn't throw it away. Surprise, surprise. Tracking doesn't show it as delivered and had it marked as ""out for delivery"" for over a week. Since it's the buyer's responsibility to return the item safely, we don't have to do anything, but since this customer obviously doesn't know how the world works, we call the post office on her behalf to see if they can find the package. They say that the customer failed to put a suite number on the package and it was being returned to the customer. But tracking never updated and it's lost in the ether. We tell the customer this and she opens an eBay case. 

EBay waits a week and tracking still doesn't show anything and the post office has no more information so they close the case in our favor.

When I asked to provide any kind of diagnosis information, I got various info, but the answers. During dialogue I got info that he have exact same videocard which is working fine (uh-oh!), but it's mine that failing. 
I've asked him to provide diag information from his PC multiple time, and in two days all I got is quite blurry video shows that one card is failing on 3D apps and one is working.

I feel like that someone is trying to swap faulty videocard that way, because:
-Never shared diagnosis information.
-Never answered direct questions (Driver, OS, PSU, PC specs, etc)

What steps should I take if I wanna avoid being scammed? 
Obviously I have pics of card showing SN and other stickers, but you can move it, if you really want. 

How do I solve situation, in case I get my card back, and it's mine, and it's working fine for me, during the 3D Apps and benchmarks?

Ebay,Postcard seller scam,"Hey folks,

I ordered a ipad off of ebay.  The seller sent a package through ontrac, from san jose, a different address then what they had listed with ebay.  The package was said to be delivered on Monday to my po box.  But the post office had no package for me on Monday or tuesday.  I called ontrac on wednesday, figuring that, because it is ontrac, it is probably their fault. =P.  But ontrac directed me to zazzle.com. When I called zazzle, they said that the package did not contain an ipad, but rather a postcard from them,  and it was sent to a different address in the same zipcode.  They gave me a case number and told me to give it to ebay if they had any questions.  So now I have started the dispute process at ebay, with all of this information.  The seller was a new seller,  and it has only been 2 days since the package was delivered,  so I am pretty sure that my money has not been released from paypal yet.  

Anyway,  I just wanted to get this scam out there as something to watch out for, and I also wanted to know if their was anything else I should be doing to get my money back.  Thanks!",3,9,2017-04-26,EBAY,0.039562616497278214,0.9265461564064026,0.03389118239283562
Ebay,Anyone else unable to remove Best Offer?,"Sorry if this has already been discussed, I did a search but didn't see anything.

After an eBay hiatus, I listed an item (fixed price) this morning. I never got a checkbox for the Best Offer option. The option was added to the listing anyway and I couldn’t remove it. 

It turns out I had overlooked the following language at the bottom of the page: 

&gt; By clicking List it, you agree to pay all applicable fees **and receive reasonable offers from buyers.**

(emphasis added)

And when you click on “Learn more”: 

&gt; When you choose 'Fixed price', we'll send you reasonable offers from buyers (if any) to give you a better chance of selling. Offers sent are based on similar items that sold on eBay. **If your Buy It Now price is low to begin with, then we won't send you offers.** You choose whether to accept or decline.

It looks like instead of allowing sellers to decide whether they want to state a firm price or consider offers, eBay is deciding for us, depending on where the listing price is in comparison to their suggested range. (Incidentally, my item sold very quickly for my full asking price, so if anything I underpriced it.) 

I did find a clumsy workaround. I was able to remove the Best Offer option by ending the listing, going to My Ebay &gt; Unsold, and hitting relist. Instead of taking me to the full listing page it popped up a much smaller box that just had the listing price and a Best Offer checkbox. I unchecked Best Offer and the relisting did not have it. But I still don’t see any way to remove Best Offer when creating a new listing from scratch.",6,8,2017-04-26,EBAY,0.0470455139875412,0.9211644530296326,0.03179001435637474

Obviously, they won't be able to ship it out today as it's already night in their time zone. Does the case automatically close in my favor because they missed the return deadline?

Ebay,Received a pair of counterfeit Ray Ban sunglasses,"Hi there,

As the title indicates, I have received a pair of counterfeit Ray Ban sunglasses. I have owned this pair in the past, and the biggest giveaway is the lack of metal struts in the arms. These also feel quite lightweight, and frankly, the more I look at them, the crappier they feel. I can also find some pictures that show the printing on the inner temple arms being closer to the hinges than the pair I received. I am not sure what to do. The seller has stellar feedback and has an authenticity guarantee, so I emailed them to let them know about this problem. I have also emailed Ray Ban customer service to ask about the metal struts and hope to hear back soon.

I asked about the possibility of a steep discount, seeing as the seller will not be able to resell them, and I wasn't aware [until now] that the seller is responsible for return shipping. I thought I would be out money for that, which is why I wanted to strike a deal.

But I also found this :

Counterfeit items

If a buyer suspects that an item is counterfeit, and there are strong indicators that the item is counterfeit, we don't require the buyer to return the item to the seller. The buyer agrees to cooperate with us to ensure the proper disposal of the item. In such instances, we refund the buyer for the full cost of the item and original shipping, and the seller reimburses us for the refund. The buyer may not sell the item on eBay or elsewhere.

Does anyone have experience on how I should approach this? I am also curious as to what eBay means by ""working with the buyer to ensure proper disposal.""

Ebay,"Buyer trying to scam, saying half of order not received.","Hello all, I'm hoping you can provide some advice on what I should say to eBay to win my case.

I recently listed 2 identical items for sale with buy it now of $250 with free shipping.  The same buyer purchased both items and had a good rating.

The buyer submitted a claim with a message saying only 1 item was received and demanding a refund for the missing item.  

What evidence can I provide to prove that the buyer is lying?  The shipping weight of the box is more than double the manufacture listed weight of the single item.  The buyer didn't make any false claims that there were anything else in the package to account for the extra weight, but I'm betting he will come back and claim something to that effect.

Almost immediately after I created the listing a user sent me a message indicating that there is a specific title for the artwork on my item. I thanked him for the info and edited the description to add the name of the pattern. 

Since then he has been hounding me. At 3AM last night he sent me another message saying ""I don't know why you haven't updated the listing yet since I told you the title of the artwork"" and ""You wouldn't want others to be misled if they don't know the title, as I do""

So I looked at his page this AM, it turns out that he has over 50 items for sale by this same brand as mine. Some are nearly identical pieces. 

Should I be worried about this guy trying to report my listing as ""misleading title""? He is basically competing with listings for other collectible items similar to mine and now he's becoming quite pushy towards me.

On Wednesday 4/26/17, I purchased a Dungeons and Dragons Adventurebook (Curse of Strahd for anyone interested), and on Thursday 4/27/17, I purchased some tiny little gargoyle mini figurines for D&amp;D. I received email confirmations and tracking numbers for both. Both paid with the same debit card (with more than enough money on there to pay for them).

Today (4/28/17) I went to check the tracking numbers and I saw an email that said the bid I entered for the book had been cancelled. I have no idea why it was cancelled, and it left me confused. I checked my debit card statements, and the payment for it went through. About two minutes later I got an email saying my account was suspended because ""recent activity has raised serious security concerns"" and as a result my account was suspended and ""item listings have been removed.""

Does anyone know what would have happened?? Tracking numbers show that one is waiting to be received by USPS and the other is waiting on a shipping label. Am I not getting them? I'd rather have the stuff than the money back, but do I need to try and pursue a refund? What do I do?",5,2,2017-04-28,EBAY,0.2498115748167038,0.7256258726119995,0.024562546983361244

Ebay,Won a bid and now the seller wants 2x the money that I paid. Then relisted the item for ~3x the original price.,"Howdy all.  I don't use ebay too often, maybe purchased 10 items in the past 5 years. Well, I won a bid this afternoon and shortly after winning the bid (for about 60 dollars including shipping), the seller contacted me and said that the listing price was messed up and should have been $160.  Then offered to sell me the item for $100?  Is this guy scamming me, and should I contact ebay? He already re-listed the item for $160. I have already sent the payment through paypal. Should I try to retract the payment or ask him to? And, should I leave negative feedback? Like I said, I don't use ebay often so I don't know the standard operating procedures. 


Update: The seller refunded my money before the arrival date, and I didn't have to ask for it.  I'm just chalking this one up to the guy/gal made a mistake (wrong price on an auction and didn't cancel it), but did do the right thing by refunding my money without me asking for it or contacting Ebay. 

Thanks!",16,14,2017-04-29,EBAY,0.06352262198925018,0.9076995253562927,0.028777824714779854

Ebay,eBay and taxes and tax compliance,So I started importing small items from china and reselling from eBay. And I definitely will be reporting the income to the IRS as I'm happy to do given the income I'm getting out of it.

Ebay,Buyer trying to scam me..,"Hey guys - will try and make this quick.

I sold an item on eBay with two postage options, 24hr courier and recorded post (3-5 working days). 
The item was dispatched well within the eBay time frame I had set and was sent out with the buyers postage requirements (3-5 days). 
He messaged me the day after the item was dispatched saying the item is taking too long to arrive and demanding a refund. 
I let the buyer know that with the option he had selected when it would would arrive and how on checkout there was another option if it was urgent. 
He then starts threatening me and saying that he will open a returns case against me.
The next day, the item has arrived and he's saying it's faulty, demanding a refund...

Now he has admitted in eBay mail that he has bought another item and wants to return mine (pretty sure you cannot change your mind), been threatening and just plain rude about the whole process.
I know that when selling on eBay you have little to no rights but where he has admitted one thing on mail and opened a case against something else, surely I have something to stand on in this case?",4,12,2017-04-29,EBAY,0.06603160500526428,0.9002300500869751,0.033738430589437485
Ebay,Should I open a case? Seller sold me sneakers without listing the very obvious defects they have.,"So I won an auction for a brand new pair of limited edition sneakers, and I'm really disappointed in the condition they arrived...
They're new alright, but the left shoe of the pair is looking like some nasty B grade. The left shoe has some very noticeable glue stains on the suede, and the mid sole parts look like my 9 year old brother glued it together, while managing to get chips of the mid sole break off... 



The guy never mentioned anything about any flaws with the sneakers in the item description (Otherwise I wouldn't have bought them). I tried contacting the seller about this and he shakes off any responsibility saying ""Contact [Store Name] regarding quality. They were purchased directly from them. I didn't make the shoes myself nor do I control manufacturing"", and that ""No shoe is perfect.""


So is this worth opening a case? Is it possible to get E-bay to make him accept a return and give me full refund, or at least a partial refund?",23,10,2017-04-29,EBAY,0.06317462772130966,0.9038515090942383,0.03297379985451698
Ebay,"Sold a Mechanical Keyboard on eBay, Had it dispatched Monday, Buyer is harassing me asking where his keyboard is yet doesn't know enough English to understand my replies.","Sold a Mechanical Keyboard on eBay, Had it dispatched Monday, First Class signed for Delivery. Every day since Tuesday, He's sent me the message ""Hi, My keyboard isnt here yet"" and each time I've replied telling him to refer to the tracking information, Telling him that it'll be delivered within the next few days.

Anyhow, Royal Mail attempted to Deliver his Keyboard today, And waddya know I get another message ""Hi my keyboard isn't here yet"", In anger I check the Tracking on the package as he obviously doesn't want to / doesn't understand how to even though I've explained to him about 15 times already how to refer to it, and of course, He has missed the Delivery, And of course it's my fault. So, I return a message explaining that the Delivery service has attempted to deliver his parcel and that he either needs to re-arrange delivery or pick up the parcel from the sorting office himself.

He then replies 15 minutes later saying ""Is it safe to deliver today"" , From what I understand, He's asking if the parcel will be delivered today. By this point my mind = blown. I don't know what else to do or say other than explain once more that he missed the door, And needs to re-arrange delivery or pick up the parcel from his local sorting office again.

He hasn't replied back yet, and I dont think I'm going to reply back to him again. I use eBay to sell items, Not school adults on English lessons and how to use a parcel delivery service.

I informed him about the shipment and told him I had the package insured to the full value.

Later, when he received the device. He tells me it doesn't work, doesn't have a ROM on it, and doesn't turn on.

The pictures in my listing show the phone including a small personal defect I placed to insure it isn't just swapped out with a busted one. He hasn't initiated a return yet, and I plan to call eBay about the issue.

Ebay,"I won an auction for a camera bundle on 13/04/17. I paid five minutes later. The seller posted the item on 21/04/17, a day after it was estimated to arrive. It arrived a day later than the courier's 48 hour guarantee on 25/04/17 with a major defect. What should I do?","I won an auction on 13/04/17 for a Canon EOS 5D Classic bundled with a lens, two batteries, a charger and a bag, for £427 inc. p&amp;p. So far, so good. 

Except that the seller messaged me a couple of hours later saying:

&gt; It is very bad timing that the post office is now not open for 4 whole days. I will try and go through parcel force or UPS for you. 

&gt;I just wanted you to be aware of the bank holiday that is all. 

Fair enough. Six days later and I haven't heard a thing. I message the seller, asking them for an update. They say: 

&gt;It's been a bit of a nightmare. Ups DPD and parcel force all quoted a lot more then you sent me. And the post office was shut Friday-Monday. Soonest I can do with my busy work schedule is tomorrow afternoon. My post office shuts at 5 which is very annoying. Hope that's okay. 

They end up not despatching the item until Friday, a day later than they've assured me they would, which is still over a week after I have paid for the item. 

I ask for a tracking number, given that their own listing specifies economy delivery (which comes with a tracking number). They reply: 

&gt; Unsure how ebay have put that I sent it that way. I sent it signed for/tracked. Ended up costing me £22 in the end. 

I ask for a tracking number again. They don't reply. 

I wait until the end of Monday 24/04/17. The bundle should have arrived by now. Still no tracking number or reply from the seller, so I phone eBay, who recommend I file an item not received claim, which I do. 

The bundle finally arrives on Tuesday 25/04/17, [with labels clearly stating that (i) it was despatched on 21/04/17, that (ii) it would be delivered within 48 hours and that (iii) the postage cost was *not* £22.](http://i.imgur.com/Oy6pZR6.jpg) There was nothing fancy about the paper wrapping and plastic bag stuffing either. Or the dust in the camera body and dirt in the bag.

Whatever. I close the INR claim on the Tuesday. 

Here's where the real trouble begins. There is a serious problem with the viewfinder. 

[This is what you're meant to see through the viewfinder.](http://i.imgur.com/xA20aBN.jpg)

[This is what the viewfinder displays on the camera I was sold.](http://i.imgur.com/MrGZFhs.jpg)

[This is an even bigger problem given that the seller claimed that the camera had been fully serviced recently at a cost of ~£100.](http://i.imgur.com/JPiQ9E1.png)

I asked for some help over at /r/Photography and they've told me that the focusing screen is missing from the camera and that of course, this wouldn't be the case had the camera just been serviced. I can buy a new one for $35, they tell me. I'm also pretty sure one of the batteries doesn't work either. 

Now ... this is a lot to deal with, so I would like your advice on how to approach it. 

I want to ask the seller what they have done with the focusing screen, why they have posted a misleading listing and I also want to leave negative feedback because they have conned me a bit here. I need to buy a part which shouldn't be missing from a camera they've claimed has been certified recently as being in working condition. 

They have also told me that the shutter count is ~8,000. I also now worry that this is another lie, which will cost me more time and maybe money to verify, which I want to do before I leave feedback. 

What do you make of all this? What's the most professional way to deal with this?
