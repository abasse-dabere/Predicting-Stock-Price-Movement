Ebay,Buyer claims item was defective?,"I sold a wireless speaker and the buyer is claiming it doesn't work.

I know for a fact it was working perfectly the day I shipped it because I test everything to make sure it works before listing and again before shipping. 

I have ""No Returns"" on all my listings and I am assuming the buyer just had buyers remorse. Either way, I responded to the buyer saying something along the lines of ""it worked perfectly the day I shipped it, perhaps you have not set it up properly"".

Buyer has not responded and I have not accepted or responded to the return request since sending that one message but the $50 from the sale and the initial $10 shipping was automatically taken back out of my paypal account. 

***Here's the part I'm wondering about most. I called ebay to explain that I was sure the item was working before sending and asked if I would now be out the first shipping cost and also have to pay for the return shipping. The person I spoke with was very nice but might have just been humoring me. He said everything I wanted to hear- told me that as a valued ebay user and seller he believed me when I said the item was working when I shipped it and that I should not respond to the return and let the buyer escalate it. He said the buyer will have to return the item and the return shipping will be held to my account.. but after the buyer has sent it back I can file a claim and ebay seller protection will reimburse me for the initial shipping and return shipping? is this true or was the ebay representative running me in circles so that I am SOL in the end?

Ebay,Buyer still able to contact me after I blocked him and also suspect that it might be a kid,"A few weeks ago I got insultingly low offers on one of my items and after declining this guy keeps asking me what is the lowest price I will take for it. The BIN was $300 and I could easily sell it in less than an hour for $250 but he was offering $20, $30 etc. and it was also annoying that he had 0 negotiating skills so I just decided to block him. So he hasn't bought anything off me but somehow he is still able to message me, and now he keeps sending me messages that make me suspect he is a kid. He just had poor grammar that is pretty common among kids and only had 14 feedback which makes me think he just uses his parents' cards to buy a few things. He sent messages like just ""hi"" and his account is over three years old. He messaged me again today asking if I knew why he can't add it to the cart and I just said it was a problem with eBay. I really don't want to sell to him at this point even if he pays what I am asking, I have a feeling he is going to return it like a similar incident in the past.

Ebay,Sellers: What are your least-favorite customer messages...,"Obviously ""I want to return this"" is no fun. I'm not talking about the blatantly-bad stuff. I'm talking about customer messages that trigger my 'trouble' sensors and make me want to block. Here are a couple of mine, what are yours?

1. Shipping advice. Customer writes in before/after sale and explains to me how my shipping is too high (on items that aren't free ship). Never mind that we do this all day, every day, don't charge ""handling"" just straight shipping, and have every incentive and reason to ship the cheapest possible way. Oh no, you're going to 'splain to me how I should have shipped it cheaper... PS - you are wrong. ""This could have gone first class"" (no, it was 18 ounces). This could have gone in a flat-rate box (No, it didn't fit... Or maybe it was 2lbs and actually cheaper to send ""calculated""). Etc.
2. ""Over"" packing advice. ""You could have used a smaller box and less packing""... ""You shouldn't be using \[packing material X\]"" (despite the fact we use ONLY recycled materials)... And yet that would be the first customer to file ""damaged in transit"" and expect me to eat it if we didn't pack well enough.
3. ""I can't read""... things like ""Does this listing for 'Set of front brake rotors, including left &amp; right rotors' include both the left &amp; right rotors?"" (the picture also shows 2 rotors, FWIW). ""What's the length on these 12"" shock absorbers"" is another favorite.",78,27,2018-11-03,EBAY,0.045556552708148956,0.9062215089797974,0.0482218861579895
Ebay,Why would a seller try to empty box scam me?,"I ordered a hard drive for $75. Package comes and is empty. First time this has ever happened to me. I opened up claims on ebay/paypal (later learned you only want to open a claim on one--preferably ebay--because ebay will close a claim if you have one opened on PP too) for a ""not as described"" item. For some reason, the scammer accepted my return request and provided a shipping label. I wrapped up the empty package he sent me and sent it back--free of charge. Apparently, the seller opened a claim of his own on ebay, so it wasn't closed even though I have one open on PP as well. I provided the tracking information for the return, and the ebay dispute has updated to ""awaiting item delivery"". I also had to file a police report and send that information to ebay via e-mail.

&amp;#x200B;

I assume that once the item is delivered I will automatically receive a refund?

&amp;#x200B;

So why would a seller try this? Do these seller scammers expect you to file an ""item not received"", which makes them win the case automatically? Or do they figure you won't want to go through all the trouble involved and will let them get away with it?

&amp;#x200B;

He received a second negative feedback, in addition to mine, within the last couple days for the same item. Except it says the item doesn't work at all. This guy is a real PoS...

Ebay,"Bought new, sealed iPhone SE from ebay. Model # does not match the storage on the box","Hi all, I bought a new and sealed iPhone SE from ebay. However I am skeptical about it for two reasons: 1) the text on the back of the box is upside down relative to the iPhone picture on the front. &amp; 2) the model number (mlmg2ll/a) is a 64GB Verizon A1662 model (unlocked). Whereas the box has a 128GB sticker on the back, which is what I ordered.

I am tempted to open it up and inspect the phone itself but this was supposed to be a gift for someone and I would rather give it to them in a sealed condition.

Anyways is it common for used iPhones to be sold as new/sealed on eBay? Is it easy to make a fake box and seal it making it appear new?

Thanks for any advice.

**UPDATE:** I opened the iPhone box, the phone was definitely in new condition. I checked some settings and everything is legit. It even worked fine with my SIM card. The model number must be wrong on everymac.com because this iPhone is showing 128GB of storage (in the OS) whereas everymac shows 64GB of storage for this model #. I definitely got what what I ordered!

I wish I didn’t have to unseal it but I guess it’s worth it for me to breathe easy when giving it as a gift. I’ll repackage it with the old plastic as best I can, lol.",6,2,2018-11-03,EBAY,0.026164839044213295,0.9123616814613342,0.06147351115942001

Ebay,Horrible experience buying a used car,"Not sure if I can give the sellers name but if I can, let me know and I will be glad to. I recently bought a car on Ebay and wanted to share my experience. I won the bid on a car on Oct. 4th. It was a 2015 Cadillac SRX for $13,700. It had been in an accident and was rebuilt (hence the lower price). Before bidding I contacted them and asked about the condition and if it needed anything. They said no it was ready to go and in great condition! I mainly decided to buy from this Ebay seller because they claimed to be the following:

**#1 Seller/Rebuilder of previously light damaged vehicles on Ebay  since 2010...NOBODY comes even close!!!!!!!!!!!**

**#1 highest rated feedback seller on Ebay period receiving only the highest accolades since 2010!**

**#1 repeat customer seller/service anywhere since 2010!**

**#1 original copied listings/wording/layout since 2010!  You can see most other accounts copy our exact layout.**

**#2 most followed Ebay dealer in the world since 2010!!!!!!!!!!!!**

**Given Ebay EXCELLENCE seller status year after year! Why buy from anyone else??????**

&amp;#x200B;

Everything started out well. I won it for a fairly low price and received a very low shipping rate of $450. They contacted me and sent me the buying info (after a couple of days of asking). I noticed in the paperwork that it had a salvage title when it should be rebuilt. I contacted them and they said they made a mistake and the car was listed early and they hadn't received the rebuilt title to the car yet and said it should be in within 7-10 days. So I waited. During this time Hurricane Michael came through my town (Panama City). It was THE worst experience of my life...my town is GONE, my home destroyed. For weeks it was a constant battle for food, ice, water, etc.. During this time waiting for the title I had to rent a car, ($45 a day), for what I thought would be 7 to 10 days. During the wait I had asked them to please, please have the car ready to go (serviced, completely checked out, etc.) because everything in my town was gone, there would be no place to get anything serviced or done for weeks or months. So after almost 3 LONG weeks later the title finally comes in. I wire them the money. It then takes them 9 more days til they ship the car!! I was very upset about that but at the same time not being mean or rude to them in emails. The new shipping quote is now $950 (up from the original $450)!! That made me furious as well but I desperately needed a dependable car so I paid the money. A couple of days later I FINALLY get the car. Remember I won it on Oct. 4th and it finally arrived on Nov. 1st!! So here comes with biggest frustration, they did not even check the car or service the car AT ALL. The oil life is at 17%!! That by itself is dangerous. The brake fluid, washer fluid, power steering, even the gas, everything that could be empty, was empty or extremely (dangerously) low. On top of all that, the car makes funny noises, the ac makes a whining noise, tires are damaged, it was filthy inside and out, only came with one key, was missing items they claimed it had, and on and on and on. I contacted them and their excuse was, ""they lost money on the car so they didn't check anything or service anything"" !!!!! Car dealers ALWAYS claim they are losing money or upside down on cars so I know that is COMPLETE BS. Now, I still have no car because most places around here are not open yet due to the Hurricane and who knows how much longer I have to wait til I can even use the car. All said and done (car rental fees, higher shipping cost, dealer fee, etc.) the total is now right at $16,000, and this is before getting the car checked out, serviced, fixing multiple issues, etc. The whole experience has been a nightmare and they will not and did not do anything to help me when I contacted them! And to top it off, when I emailed them to complain the day I received the car, they opened an unpaid item case with Ebay!!!! What?? I think this was to try to cancel the sale, and to remove my negative feedback I left. Little do they know I contacted Ebay and they said they will remove the unpaid item strike and my negative feedback will remain. Ebay also said they are looking into the situation because they said the seller is not suppose to have buyers wire them money like the way I did.

Does anyone know if I have any recourse from them? Anyone (besides Ebay) that I can call and report them to? I was thinking of reporting them to BBB or the State Attorney's office?

Moral of the story, please do not think that if a seller on Ebay has 100% feedback that you can trust them. And never, ever buy a car sight unseen from anyone. If anyone has any advice on what to do I would greatly appreciate it. Sorry for the long post but I wanted to get my story out there.

Ebay,Buyer claims fake. No Claim filed. Negative feedback.,"Have a buyer that claimed a skincare item was tampered, not authentic and would be sending the product to the manufacturer to prove it's fake. I called eBay immediately to get advice and place a note on my account that this buyer seemed shady. eBay reps stated the message sounds like extortion, noted other activity from the buyer that raises red flags and agreed to put a note in my account. I messaged the buyer urging them to get the item authenticated at a retailer. To no one's surprise, the buyer kept the product and left a very negative feedback. 

Problem is, eBay never advised me to ask the buyer to file a claim. **I** didn't know I could request the buyer file a claim. Now, after the negative feedback, eBay states a did poor seller practices by not requesting a claim to be filed. I'm at a loss. They advised I contact the buyer and request they file the claim (since I can't initiate it) and maybe once a resolution is found, ask them to consider changing the feedback. I hesitate to take this action because the product is used - it's unsellable now (especially if the buyer decides to tamper with the product if they send it back during the claim process). eBay has strict rules on selling used skincare. Thus any resolution for the buyer would still result in over $100 loss for this one item. 

Is there anything that can be done for this issue?",20,9,2018-11-04,EBAY,0.21120266616344452,0.7651397585868835,0.02365754172205925
Ebay,Am I in danger of losing a SNAD case for item not received case (with tracking showing delivered)?,"I sold an expensive cologne to an individual a while back. Long story short, even though the tracking showed that it was delivered, the customer said they did not receive it.

After emailing me and complaining to me about not receiving the item multiple times, and after me telling them to file an INR (item not received) case with eBay each time, they only finally did it today, which is 30 days and a few hours after it was delivered to their address, thus deeming them ineligible for eBay Buyer protection, because it is past the 30 day mark.

So basically, I'm guessing that they're going to go to PayPal next and will open up a SNAD case. My question is whether I'm in danger here (again, the tracking showed that this was delivered a month ago).",3,6,2018-11-04,EBAY,0.03209468722343445,0.9298753142356873,0.038029976189136505

I've never seen begging to this degree on ebay before. I just don't understand why they seem so desperate. Are they just hoping they can go over some date where I can't get refunded anymore, or do you think there is a real reason? It's only ~$8CAD, I'm not upset, and never indicated being upset at all in my one message to them (they wrote asking if I received it and I told them I haven't, nothing more), but what reason would they have where they don't want me to resolve this through ebay?",25,5,2018-11-04,EBAY,0.08341779559850693,0.8858879804611206,0.030694197863340378

Ebay,"Why doesn't eBay tell you EXACTLY what your fees are, right before you list something?","BUY IT NOWS NOT AUCTIONS.

&amp;#x200B;

Been selling on eBay and Amazon for 10+ years and I am starting to get annoyed at how Amazon is so user friendly compared to eBay.

&amp;#x200B;

Their shady practice of collecting fees is really getting to me. Why not just take the fees out when the item sells? Why does paypal take the money immediately but ebay waits 30 days?

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost like eBay deliberately doesn't tell you what your fees are before listing, in fear that you wont sell the item with them(I know you can check the fee table at any time but the system should tell you EXACTLY what the fees are, along with PAYPAL fees, right before you hit the post listing button).

Ebay,PSA: eBay provides no seller protections,"As of this summer, eBay has a new policy regarding seller protections in the case of fraudulent returns or other edge cases. Prior to this, eBay would unofficially cover you for these by issuing a reimbursement from their corporate account. Apparently they were taking too big of a loss due to fraud, and decided to offload all of this onto buyers and (mostly) sellers. (If you call in and ask about this, they will give you a spiel about how eBay is a business and they have to make money, and your business should build these losses into your margins).

&amp;#x200B;

With this new policy, eBay will not, under ANY circumstances, cover/reimburse the seller for:

\- Empty box returns

\- New-&gt;Old replacement returns (the old 'switcharoo'), or where the buyer clearly used an item

\- Carrier issues with a package (stuck-in-transit-4-lyfe)

\- Any other case that they can skimp out on

&amp;#x200B;

It was never eBay's official policy to cover sellers on these types of issues, but in the past, I've had every single one of them covered with a fairly easy phone call or two. Now, eBay has decided that it's the seller's problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I have several problems with this:

\- eBay never communicated this clear removal of seller protections

\- eBay framed this move as a positive move, by highlighting the new ""free returns"" policy, where you (as a seller) could deduct up to 50% of a buyer's purchase price from a return -- but only if you offer free returns. This effectively splits \*any\* buyer/seller dispute between the buyer and the seller, and eBay is cleverly bowing out of any financial compensation for these. They fail to mention that, all of a sudden, you have zero protections against fraud now (as a seller). The \*most\* that you can hope to get back from a fraudulent return is 50%, and that's only if you offer free returns for everybody else.

\- eBay has effectively changed our terms, eliminating any recourse/protections we used to have, all while taking the same fees from us -- i.e. decreasing the value of their platform, but keeping the price the same.

\- Going forward, eBay has no real incentive to thwart fraudulent buyers. Prior to this, they had a direct, strong financial incentive to stop these guys since eBay was usually on the hook (unofficially) for the empty box (and similar) returns. I strongly suspect that, as we get further down the road, eBay will de-prioritize the effort of finding/catching fraudulent buyers since there is no direct financial impact anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

With the way that eBay representatives all talk about this, it's clear that they've had very targeted training on what to say when this issue is brought up. They all say the exact same things, and then suddenly start repeating all their lines when the script runs out. ""eBay is a business and we need to cut our costs"", ""We shouldn't be held responsible for these problems that are outside of our control, since we're just a platform"", ""You need to build these types of things into your business' margins"", etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I wanted to throw this out there and make sure that everyone knows what you're getting into if you're thinking about selling on eBay. I'm going to run some numbers tonight for my own business to see how much eating all the fraud-related costs is going to hurt. It sucks because one fraudulent purchase/return can eliminate 50+ sales, especially since the fraudulent purchases are typically higher-dollar items.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the fact of this being a total lie because I have sold dozens of the same item on eBay (2 others, same day, same listing) all new and never once have I had a return for any of them claiming that the item was not new. I do not even have the option of buying this option used as it is only avliable to me new and still factory sealed.

Ebay,Need help - but got refund and still has item,"I’m going to try to keep this brief. I listed a diamond engagement ring for sale. It was purchased in September. When the buyer received the ring she stated she no longer wanted it because I hadn’t noted the clarity in my listing. Ok... I disagreed but opened a case and eBay sides with her. She marked the item as shipped and her money was refunded from my PayPal account. A week and a half goes by and I haven’t received the ring. I message the buyer and she gives me the tracking info. For some reason, the PayPal address that defaulted was one in Florida where I haven’t lived in 10 years. I live in Kentucky now so I couldn’t exactly go get it. I called the FL post office where the ring ended up and they said all they could do was return the package to sender. I messaged the buyer (who up until this point had been very responsive) to let her know that the ring would be coming back to her. I asked her to notify me when it arrived and I would send her a prepaid label to return it to my correct address. 

You can probably guess what comes next. She received the package on October 22 and has been ignoring my messages since. She now has my ring and her money. I called ebay for the first time on October 23 and explained the situation. They asked me to give her a few more days to respond, and if she didn’t, to send her a PayPal invoice to pay for the ring. They said if thIs didn’t work to call back and they would give me a “third option”. I did both of those things and didn’t receive a response from buyer. I called ebay back as instructed and was told... get this... to call her. I said ok, I doubt that will work, but ok. Of course it didn’t work. I called back on November 1 and spoke with a rep who immediately said “In these situations we will contact the buyer on your behalf and we can  almost guarantee a resolution.” Great! So today (November 7) I called back to ask for an update. The rep I reached said ebay absolutely does contact buyers for any reason in these situations. I eventually talked to her supervisor who said the same and said he had no idea why I was told they would. He eventually agreed to email her but said he couldn’t make her respond and they wouldn’t suspend her account or really do anything to make her pay/return. 

What can I do here?!!?? I know it’s technically my mistake that the ring was sent to Florida (although I’ve used PayPal many times since living at this address without issue) but surely this girl can not get away with keeping my ring and not paying for it?! I am so infuriated. I would appreciate any advice.

Ebay,"On obvious unauthorized transaction, who gets the shipments?","So I've recently got a lot of unauthorized transactions filed against me (well I guess not against me but through Paypal/credit card companies),  they are pretty easy to spot considering the buyer buys a particular brand I sell and then asks me to change the delivery address. Just a quick PSA--NEVER AGREE TO THIS as a seller! Cancel the transaction and ask the buyer to change their default shipping and then re-order. If they make an excuse to why they can't, its 100% fraud and not just someone who accidentally forgot to change their address or might share an account.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving forward, you are protected as a seller in these unauthorized transaction cases if you ship to the address provided to you by ebay/paypal. I always do this and I've had about 7 unauthorized transaction cases opened and closed with me recovering the funds after the case resolves itself since I know the rules. 

However, I do wonder what happens to the item I ship to the correct address. Specifically, does the fraudster have both addresses listed or is the default address the person he/she hacked? I can see two possibilities here: one is that they have both addresses and that maybe they only get away with fraud if they win an authorized transaction case (otherwise why would they even care if the seller loses seller protection). However, it's my understanding that the credit card or paypal refunds the account holder and does not take those funds from the seller if they ship to the appropriate address, which makes me think they wouldn't care about the outcome because they win regardless. The other possibility is that they only have one address just prey on a naive seller to change the address--and if they do they get the item for free since they hacked they account. Maybe the original owner of the credit card or paypal account notices this and opens an unauthorized transaction. But I'm curious even though I won't attempt this BUT if the latter is true, does it matter if I even ship the correct item as long as I have a tracking number and it shows it's delivered the correct address. If the shipment goes to the person who's account is hacked they probably won't care or just be confused, if the account is hacked and the fraudster gets the box, then the fraudster doesn't get the expensive item they hacked some poor person's account for.

I then tried to cancel the order, but every help page told me to click links that no longer existed, redirected me to pages that didn't work or told me to select options I didn't have available; this was hands down the worst experience on a shopping website I've ever had. At this point I decided to take matters in my own hands and cancel my payment directly through the Paypal website. Doing this changed the payment to cancelled/pending - so obviously I didn't know if it was cancelled or pending.

While I waited to find out, I later got an email from Ebay saying I'd bought an item from a hacked account and that it was removed. Basically, a confirmation I'd been scammed. At this point I presumed everything was under control, but no - Paypal later released the money to the scammer. The transactions shows up twice under my activity. Firstly as cancelled, but after another newer listing says pending until. I don't know what pending until is, or why Paypal overrode my cancellation, but the money has left my bank account. Now here comes the best part - my only option of recourse, according to the email from Ebay, is to contact the scammer and ask for a refund! Oh pretty, pretty please Mr.Scammer.

Have you ever heard anything so stupid in your life?! Does anyone know of any other options available to me that aren't as completely futile as Ebay's suggestion?

Edit: So it looks like my pending payment may be a refund. It says:

**eBay payment received** from null

X November 2018 at 14:59:10 GMT

Payment status: PENDING

X Nov 2018 Payment to

X Nov 2018 Temporary Hold

Do these unhelpful transaction details look like a refund to anyone?

Ebay,Undercharged Buyer for Shipping - Not sure easy way to do this,"I'm new to eBay and this is my first sale, but I accidentally undercharged my buyer for shipping because I under-listed the weight because I got the weights mixed up with a different product I'm selling.

I printed the shipping label and realized my mistake and tried to pay for the difference at the post office counter. I found out that wasn't allowed. From my understanding, the best way to resolve this issue is to void the shipping label (which I've already done) in order to issue a refund to him and have a reorder on the shipping label. However, I do not want to make him pay extra for my mistake, so I then refund him the difference through PayPal. It seems a bit complicated fix, so I was just wondering if there was an easier way to fix this situation. I messaged my buyer the situation, but I just feel like this is a complicated way to fix this.

Ebay,eBays Broken,"Here is the background, I’m selling my used Ryzen Threadripper 1950x. I’m a casual eBay user, no store, not high volume. I only really sell items I own that I no longer use...so used items. Since I’m not a store and my financials don’t operate like a business, I don’t allow “buyers remorse” returns. It’s a strict return policy that states no returns except for DOA items and that must be initiated within 7-days of item delivery. 

Anyways, the CPU sells, buyer pays, I ship it seems like an easy, smooth transaction.  Unexpectedly, several days later buyer initiated a return stating the item did not work. I try to troubleshoot with him through messages but he says that he’s an experienced PC builder and would rather just return it. I accept and am now trying to figure out my options with it as I’m clearly expecting there to be an issue with the item (I should mention that it was pulled from a working computer not even a week before shipping). A few days pass and I revived the CPU back, verify serial number matches the item sent and refund the buyer. It does and I refund him his money. While verifying the serial I look closer and notice that the residual pattern from cleaning the CPU was the same in the picture I took before shipping. Curious, I cleaned it again and found the pattern changed. So, clearly the buyer never even attempted to install the processor!

I snoop a bit online and found that some website was offering a lightening sale on new 1950x’s closing the gap between what the buyer paid for my used CPU and a new one. So not only do I have to resell the item I’m also out $30+ in shipping because the buyer said there was something wrong with my item. 

This is not only frustrating but protected against by eBay. Now I’m even nervous to sell it now because Black Friday is coming up and there is sure to be similar sales so what is there to stop a buyer from buying my item, using it and returning it saying “there is a problem with it” within the 30-day guarantee window and buying a cheaper Black Friday sale new?

eBay needs to return to what they started as, an exchange for used items between private sellers. Stop catering to ridiculous buyers and start showing equal protection to your sellers.

Ebay,My nightmare Ebay Experience. Looking for Advice?,"Hey guys, this is going to be kind of a long post, but I'm going to go through my experience and my current status and there will be a TLDR at the end.  


here we go.

  

  In early August, I was planning a large move to Europe where I currently study and attend University (I'm an American.) Because of my new education aspirations I decided it was a good time to buy myself a new laptop for the school year. After considering my options, I found a refurbished dell 9560 on ebay from a buyer called New.Techies with a 99.6% positive review. The laptop had good reviews, great specs and an amazing price. I decided to purchase it and it arrived roughly a week later. After the laptop arrived roughly August 9th, I then moved to Brussels Belgium for University on August 29th, I packed up my laptop securely and brought it with me throughout the entire moving ordeal. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, roughly one week into my move, and as I'm still getting accustomed to my new surroundings, my refurbed laptop that I barely used, decided to turn off, and never turn back on. After calling dell customer support, they told me the cause was a failed motherboard, and since I lived in Europe (and I bought it in the U.S) the only way to get this item fixed was to pay to ship the laptop to Dell, and then pay to have them ship the laptop back. This would of been horribly expensive and I decided my best course of action was to go on eBay, request a refund, and ship this laptop back and be done. So I requested my refund, the seller accepted, and then a few days later I put my laptop and the return slip into a Bpost box (Belgian Post) and mailed my laptop back to the Seller in Washington State, USA.  


This is where the hell began.  


For roughly a month I heard nothing. I was in contact with Ebay throughout the entire process as I had to provide my own tracking number etc. etc. So a few weeks go by, it's now late September and I check my tracking information. It says it's made it through U.S customs but thats about it. After still not getting an update on where this $1200 refund is, I go to Bpost and inquire. They give me a new USPS tracking number and once I then check THIS tracking number, It tells me my package is in-transit, in the post office of the city where it's set to be delivered. USPS says that it arrived at this post office on September 14th 2018. Its been roughly a month and It still says its at this post office (I finally got my new tracking number somewhere around mid-October.) I can already tell, this is a bad, bad sign.  


Once I get home from classes that day, I immediately begin calling up the post office where it's supposed to be at. The USPS says they don't have it. This is still a bad sign. I finally call the customer affairs hotline of the USPS and their Washington based district and a very friendly lady named Thuy (Pronounced, TWEE) begins helping. After we both call the post office multiple times and after multiple hours of being on hold, I am finally told by Thuy that ""The package was probably delivered without a signature. Whoopsie"" The only problem is, the signature is the one thing I needed to prove to ebay that New.Techies (Or the company that owns them A.K.A Avallax) Actually received my laptop, so I can finally get a refund. After calling Ebay and explaining the situation, I'm told by this nice british guy that If i get them a letter saying it was lost in the mail that they can start the appeal process for my (Now closed) Refund. I email him the letter that Thuy provides me and in a week I call back, I am told by Ebay, Basically, ""Tough Shit"" And that I should focus on filing a claim with the USPS.   


After talking with Thuy, She tells me that they wont be able to file a claim because I sent it from a European country, and even if I did, the most theyd be able to refund me is roughly 200$ as the package was not insured (Bpost didn't offer me any form of insurance when I shipped it. And yes, I did ask.)   


My final thought has been to contact the company where my laptop was, according to the USPS, ""Accidentally delivered without signature."" However the company that I've been dealing with. (New.Techies A.K.A Avallax) Has no phone number that you can actually use to speak with a person. So far the number on the website is an automated menu where every option ends in ""SEND US AN EMAIL."" Or the other phone number online I've found is another automated message that says ""ALL LINES ARE BUSY, SEND US AN EMAIL.""  


So currently, I have very little options, and I'm out $1200. I'm angry, frustrated and increasingly and increasingly annoyed.  


Does anyone have any advice or information that could possibly help me in this situation? USPS won't give me a letter saying it was 100% delivered without signature, So it'll be impossible to prove to Ebay so I can get a refund. But on the other hand like, the company is 100% unreachable, so it easily could of been delivered and they decided ""Pffft, We can make a quick $1200 bucks off this shmuck:   


I'm a poor student. I just want my money back.  


Any advice would be appreciated.  


  
TLDR: Bought laptop off ebay before I moved to europe. I moved to europe and the mobo crapped out. Decided to opt for a refund from Ebay seller. After sending it off, USPS says it was probably delivered without signature, but they can't be 100% sure. Ebay refuses to give me money back, USPS says they can't do much. Seller is unreachable. I'm out $1200 and I need help.  


Thanks. &lt;3

Ebay,How would you proceed with this sale?,"I'm a new seller to ebay. I'm not a store, I just finally got tired of craigslist and turned to ebay recently (1 week ago). My first item was a breeze. Paid immediately and item shipped the next morning without a hitch.

""Hello friend, forgive me for not having made the payment, my father died in an accident yesterday, and I had to travel, could you wait until Sunday or Monday please? yes or if I buy your cell phones, for something I have a good reputation, I hope you can, really!"" (sic)

Does this sound sketchy enough that I should I cancel this transaction? Or should I give them the time and no later than Monday?

Ebay,"After 17 years using eBay, I am done with this company","After 17 years of using eBay (both buying and selling), I am done with this company.  Very disappointed in what happened to my recent transaction as a SELLER!

Sold and delivered an custom apparel item for Halloween on 10/22 - buyer initially claimed some trivial shipping damage which I gladly offered 10% courtesy refunds.

6 days later, asked me to return the item despite him wearing it already - said the item was poor quality as reason and filed a case ""item not ad described"", even though I don't offer return and certainly not when he has worn the item and removed the tag...after 6 days!

eBay decided to side with the buyer and issue a return label.  Today, when I picked up the returned item from the post office, the item was clearly damaged intentionally, worn out, and tag removed.  I cannot resell the item again.  

eBay charged my PayPal for the full refund on the transaction, I appealed and the Customer Service agent (and her manager) basically said they couldn't prove that the damage was done by the buyer, and that too bad for me because it's part of ""cost of business"". I asked if he can give me the benefit of the doubt, given my long history at eBay with 1000+ positive transactions - I understand they want to give buyers the benefits of the doubt, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the seller, and the manager said that he stands by his and his agent's decision.

17 years on eBay and this is what I get.  I am done with selling on eBay.  Going to buy on Amazon for the rest of my life and selling on Craiglist if I can help it!  What a poor company and it's a shame how this company has became!

You should be ashamed of yourself for saddling me with an item that would fetch no more than $1.00 in a local Swap Meet. You apparently must venerate money and your exertions to aggrandize it by avaricious methods would make the Usurers in Dante's Inferno blush. I will refrain however from submitting withering negative feedback on you. Instead I intend to register a return with Ebay and I expect to be fully refunded for the item. This vexatious issue might provide you with an opportunity to reformulate your business ethics and help you emancipate yourself from the seductive pull of lucrative, opportunistic profiteering.  


Have a wonderful day.

Ebay,Is buyer getting stupider or what? Buyer upset item he bought late yesterday still hadn't updated tracking,"Buyer bought something yesterday about 7 PM EST, well after any of the nearby post office had closed. I went ahead and bought/printed label so it'd be ready to go Monday morning.  Just a while ago, the said buyer is complaining that tracking hadn't updated and was wondering where it is since my listing promised same day shipping (my cut off time was all before 11 AM so his would be next business day anyway)

I explained he bought and paid for item after the local post office closed yesterday and there's no service at all Sunday (today) and the soonest he could expect update is Monday.

He's demanding refund because I am ""too slow"".  So I had to issue full refund and cancel the shipping label.

Going to have to call eBay and see if I can block this idiot buyer from leaving neg because he's impatient and obviously doesn't understand post office aren't 24/7 or what counts as business day.

Ebay,FREAKING OUT about first negative feedback HELP PLEASE,"Hey everyone!

This is my first time posting, and I am really hoping to get some insight and advice. I sold a set of 6 Panasonic phones September 18, 2018 with free shipping. The buyer received the phones, then opened a return case with eBay with the return reason being ""Doesn't fit"". In the comments he wrote that the phones were not new, and not authentic. They were in fact new in the box and authentic. I allowed returns on this listing as long as the buyer paid the return shipping. He paid the shipping, returned the items, and all was fine. He never reached out to me about the phones and I returned his money the same day I received the phones. I have since relisted them as pre-owned as they have received some cosmetic damage from the shipping back and forth and I want to play it safe this time. Since these phones were given to me, I was annoyed at the lose in profit but I did not want to risk bad feedback so I accepted the return, no big deal. However, today, November 11th, that buyer left me negative feedback just saying ""C"". I am a new seller and this is my first negative ever. I am very worried that this is going to impact my sales. I do not know what to do, or if there is anything I even can do. Should I reach out to the buyer and offer to refund the return shipping he paid? Should I reach out to eBay? I know I am new and thus ignorant to many things about eBay. Is there anything I could have done to prevent this from happening? Thank you in advance for any help, I really appreciate it!

Ebay,"Left negative feedback for a fraudulent seller, along with other angry customers... feedback was removed, and Ebay doesn't care","So about two weeks ago when Ebay ran their 10% off coupon I purchased a Note 9 from one of the largest phone sellers on Ebay. It was advertised as brand new and sealed. Looked at the sellers feedback and saw it was mostly positive. Okay, I felt comfortable buying, it all looked legit. Not so fast...

When I received the item I knew right away something was off about it, as the seal was not genuine Samsung. Bottom photo is the product I actually received. https://i.imgur.com/rPJljsC.png. I also reached out to Samsung and asked them if they could validate if this seal was genuine, and they confirmed with certainty that was not a genuine Samsung seal. You can even buy these fake seals off Aliexpress.

Ok, so opening the device, and again, more clues that this product was not new. Fingerprints all over the back, labels applied back to the device in a sloppy fashion. Then I boot the device up and there is no setup process. The setup was already completed, presumably by the previous owner. Then I look in the contacts, and there are contacts from the previous owner.

This company is circumventing the used phone market by selling used phones that demand a used price by repackaging them and calling them new and sealed. I reached out to Ebay via Twitter, and they don't really seem to care. All they said was I could return the device, and blah blah blah. Which yes, I intend to, but what bothers me is this is literally fraud, and Ebay refuses to react or hold this company accountable, and this company gets away with it. The phone is still being sold right now, and with the same ""new and sealed"" description.

I presented quite a bit of evidence to Ebay, and they just told me I should give feedback accordingly. So I did just that... My feedback was not vulgar or insulting in any way. I was very clear and to the point that the phone I received was not new, and had been opened. Yet somehow my feedback is now gone, and so are a lot of other negative feedbacks left by people who also bought a Note 9 from this company. There were actually quite a lot of negative feedback. I looked in my own feedback left, and there is no trace of this feedback now, and no option to leave a new feedback. How is this possible?

I've since found out quite a lot of info about the seller, and have been contemplating about going to authorities, simply because this isn't an isolated situation. How this company can just get so many negative feedbacks deleted is beyond me, and it seems like Ebay is protecting them. Getting my money back is one thing, but I feel as if this company should be held accountable for their blatant lies, manipulation, and fraudulent selling practices.",22,4,2018-11-12,EBAY,0.08380533754825592,0.8862561583518982,0.02993842028081417

Ebay,I think this is unfair for the seller,"I recently tried to buy a quite costly device on Ebay.  
The first time the seller never shipped and after opening a claim for an item not received the seller refunded right away.  
Never got a reply or any response from this seller.  
Second time the item arrived not only well packed but also factory sealed.  
And that is where things got weird and complicated.  


Within 2 days after using the Item I noticed a manufacturing defect.  
As all was already registered in my name with address, payment details and all I contacted the company for return exchange.  
Let's just say it was refused stating online selling plaforms are not covered.  
The seller had the same problem with the company as he was told that he could not have a return or repair either.  
Although bought through a supported and authorised online retailer, the seller used their local website instead of using the US site.  
Not going anywhere on either end I contacted ebay and stated the doublesided warranty problem.  
At first the support did not understand the problem and simply stated that ebay does not deal with warranty claims in any way.  
After checking the Ebay terms and conditions several times I managed to have the problem escalated.  
This time the person on the other end actually appeared to understand how both I and the seller failed to understand the warranty refusal.  
I clearly stated that I neither want to blame the seller not Ebay, just that I seek advise and possible assistance to sort this out.  
Was asked to wait and about 20 minutes later I was told the issue was discussed and that Ebay thinks this all should be covered by the buyer protection.  
Faulty is faulty so to say and with no exceptions in a warranty case as it seems.  
At the end of the chat I was informed to expect an Email with detailed instructions on how to proceed and that Ebay will open a return request claim for me.  


So far, so good I thought.  
The Email arrived a few days later but it was an automated computer with copy and paste.  
Standard return procedures with the addition of a free postage label to print out.  
With nothing more to go on I included a copy of the message I sent to the seller.  
Again clearly stating that I did not expect a refund from him or Ebay.  
Only a resolution to the warranty problem and of course that I did not even open the claim.  
A copy of the chat log and reference number was also attached.  
For some reason it took AU post to make the parcel move 5 full days.  
When the seller completed the delivery b signing it took Ebay less than an hour to send out instructions to the seller.  
And yes, I agree the seller should be angry and again yes, I don't mind his quite angry message to me either.  
Ebay now requires the seller to inspect the item, confirm the good condition and stated fault.  
Once done he is required to refund me.  


Don't get me wrong here guys!  
I don't mind being refunded by a seller if he sold me a faulty item intentionally.  
Here neither the seller, nor the buyer had a chance to be aware of the fault before actually putting the device to use.  
Now the seller is in a dispute with Ebay and Paypal about this :(  
Ebay states if I am not refunded within the timeframe then Paypal will refund me from the sellers account.  
Is that even legal?  
If I would be the seller I would be as angry as this poor guy is right now.  


Assuming there are a lot of sellers here: Did anything like this happen to you since the new buyer protection is active?  
And what do you think as a buyer about this?

Ebay,Avoiding traps when returning a defective item to china?,"Hello, 
I received an electronic device (Analog RF modulator) from a seller in China which costs me around 20AUD. It turned out to be defective so before opening a return case against the seller I contacted him to explain my problem (complete with photos) because I may have missed something. He asked for a video to be sent on sendspace but after 2 attempts at reuploading he couldn't open it and then no more replies.

I opened a NAD case against him explaining the same problem with the same photos and here's his reply.

&gt;Hi,dear customer So sorry for that. Now,we would like to resend you a new replacement as the compensation for that. May i know whether you are willing to share 8.99 AUD for the new item? Also, you don’t need to send it back. As you know,the replacement will cost us much money and we need to pay postage again. Hope for your kind understanding here. Is it acceptable for you? Waiting for your reply Best regards

I don't want to be sent a replacement since I found one of these devices locally and would rather send it back. I've never done that before on ebay, especially with chinese sellers so I would like to know what I should be aware of:

- Should I send it with tracking and accusé de reception? (I receive a delivery notice when the seller has received the parcel)

- Which proof or delivery/sending will ebay take to be refunded? Can the seller claim I didn't send back the right item, he didn't receive it or something of that sort?",8,12,2018-11-15,EBAY,0.08102388679981232,0.884064257144928,0.034911904484033585

Ebay,Unauthorized Claim and buyer lying about condition of item it was received,"So a few months ago, I sold a Supreme hoodie to a buyer. Months go buy and payment was smooth, wouldn’t have even minded doing business with him again. After a few months he messages me saying the hoodie was damaged when he received it.

He was rewarded the refund and was required to send the hoodie back. 

When I received the hoodie, it had MULTIPLE holes in it, I let PayPal know and they said to get a damage document, so I took it to the only store within a 20 mile radius that focuses on higher end clothing. I submitted the documents and they were rejected. I have been chatting with an agent and they have been no help at all as They will not tell me what is wrong with my document, they have given me ten days but are telling me to go to a different store,  but the other problem is there is no other store at all around me that specializes in this. On top of this I find it extremely unfair that the buyer did not need to go through any of this process in order to get his refund.

Another site's info on what this is says:

JS:Redirector-BMU is a trojan that comes hidden in malicious programs. Once you install the source (carrier) program, this trojan attempts to gain ""root"" access (administrator level access) to your computer without your knowledge.

Trojans like JS:Redirector-BMU are difficult to detect because they hide themselves by integrating into the operating system. Once it infects your computer, JS:Redirector-BMU executes each time your computer boots and attempts to download and install other malicious files. Upon successful execution, it deletes the source program, making it more difficult to detect.

Ebay,Buyer got the refund and stop responding my messages about returning the item.,"I was selling a brand new textbook on eBay for $60 (RRP: $85), it was for my sister but she ended up not using it. The physical book itself sat in my closet for nearly 2 years untouched as I was trying to get rid of it, but the code for the ebook was used by my sister and can't be used again. 

I listed the book as brand new because well, it is brand new. And due to a lack of communication on our part, I didn't realise the code was used. When I sold it the buyer didn't ask about the code either so I never thought it would be a problem. 

So on the day he came and collected the book, checked to see that it is in fact brand new, said it was fine, and said he will check the code when he gets home, before leaving. That's when I thought to ask my sister about the code, and told him before he returns home using eBay messages that the code is used, but she has the pdf file (which is essentially what the code is for anyway), and some extra materials like the worked solutions from the teacher's version that we can offer in return. I even offered a partial $10 refund along with that. 

He started saying that it's false advertisement because the code is used and that the book looks old (even though it is brand new, and he said it was fine on the spot after inspecting), and insisted to have a refund (even though we already offered him the electronic stuff). I got really sick and tired of the back and forth so I just accepted a return and refunded him on Paypal. 

Now I realise I should have refunded him only after receiving the book because he basically went radio silence the moment he got the money. I said I would refund him if he returns the book to my apartment but now eBay says I need to pay for the postage? I feel like he just scammed me so he could keep both the money and the book.

Ebay,Where do I stand?!,"Where do I stand?

I bought a steering wheel off eBay via Best Offer of value £70 which was accepted by the seller, let’s call him “Frank”. I instantly paid him via PayPal to as per any usual eBay transaction.

I then received an eBay message from Frank asking me to call him to discuss the transaction. The seller then proceeds to talk for quite some time about how he doesn’t use/trust PayPal due to past experiences and being very out of pocket when dealing with dodgy buyers and sellers.

Because of this, Frank asked me to send him the money via bank transfer instead of PayPal, even though at this point I am already out of pocket £70 to a PayPal account linked to his eBay. He said that he would be happy to send me the steering wheel before he received his bank transfer as he trusted me to pay him once I received it.

I made Frank aware that I would only be making payment to him once I received my refund via PayPal, as I did not want to be £140 out of pocket (£70 to PayPal and £70 bank transfer to Frank the stranger) He agreed to cancel the eBay transaction and to get me my refund and subsequently sent me the steering wheel.

**\[Note\]** In between these conversations I also enquired about purchasing a deployed airbag off him, for reasons that are not important, to which he agreed to send me the one he had, for free.

I receive the steering wheel, and a few days later (yesterday) I receive multiple messages and calls from Frank stating that he was expecting his £70 bank transfer upon delivery of the steering wheel. I inform him that I have not received my refund and so I would not yet be sending him any money, as we agreed previously.

Frank seems to then turn from the nice friendly seller he was appearing to be and starts demanding the payment now. I refuse as this was outside of our agreement. Frank then tells me he is going to arrange for a courier to pick up the steering wheel as it is still his property. I tell him that this will not be happening as it is already on the car and I have technically still paid for the item. Frank tells me he is going to personally come to my house (and he already has my address) and take the steering back off me.

I informed Frank that he should not be coming to my house and that he is now harassing me, threatening me to come to my house for what is essentially going to turn into domestic abuse of a sort and soon after hung up on him.

I sent one last message to Frank saying that it would be my final message, that I will send him his money as agreed via bank transfer once I receive my refund through PayPal, that I will not be returning his steering wheel as I have paid for the item through eBay like any normal transaction and finally that if anyone comes to my house to do with this issue, I shall be escalating the matter to the police.

There are two more messages from Frank after my last message, one which looks like a snippet of some T &amp; C’s from some sort of recovery service he has been in contact with, insinuating that someone is coming to either recover money/the item off me. The other message was sent 3 minutes later, apologising and that “we will wait for the bank transfer”, COMPLETELY out of character.

I have since seen that he has relisted the same steering wheel on ebay using the same pictures and description. So unless he had two of the same wheel, he is putting up for sale the steering wheel that is currently attached to my car.

Is there anything in this story that sounds like I am in the wrong/at fault, or liable to do anything other than wait for my refund to come through?

Thanks.

Ebay,How to handle a Cease &amp; Desist message from manufacturer on eBay,"Some background, I bought some inventory from a couple companies doing liquidations of Amazon merchandise. I bought \~100 of a certain company's products, and have been selling them on eBay. The manufacturer also sells them on eBay, as well as many others sourcing them from the same location. I am selling them for a couple dollars less than the manufacturer, in line with the other sellers.

Today I receive this message from the manufacturer's eBay account:

&gt;You are currently advertising xxCOMPANYNAMExx branded products for sale at or below MSRP. You do not have a reseller agreement with xxCOMPANYNAMExx LLC, and the inventory you are offering has been traced back to a loss from Amazon. This message is formal notification of your inventory’s providence as it relates to liability under 18 US Code s. 2315. Additionally, you are reproducing images and text protected under US Copyright without permission. This notice serves as a cease and desist in the sale of these products, and also of the violations of copyright law. We request that you kindly remove the inventory from your online catalogue, respond via eBay with your contact information (including name, phone, and physical address), and additionally supply the name and contact information of the entity which supplied the ill-gotten xxCOMPANYNAMExx products as part of the ongoing investigation. If the above action is not taken within 2 business days we will notify the marketplace of the infringements, and xxCOMPANYNAMExx will exercise any and all legal remedies at its disposal to correct these violations.

&gt;  
&gt;FirstName, CEO of xxCOMPANYNAMExx

&amp;#x200B;

There is so much that seems wrong with this message, I am not sure if I should just ignore it or not.

1. Their primary complaint seems to be that I am selling the items below their price without a reseller agreement
2. ""The inventory has been traced back to a loss from Amazon""  really? Sounds like they should take this up with Amazon or the police?
3. "" This message is formal notification of your inventory’s **providence**"" Providence? They couldn't look up the actual spelling of Provenance?
4. I'm not a lawyer, but it seems 18 U.S.C. § 2315 is about selling stuff with a value of $5,000 or more or has been used for a loan having a value of $500. The exact meaning of the $500 part of that law isn't too clear, but the total of my items are &lt; $1,000.
5. They are both telling me where I got my items, and also requesting me to tell them where I got them.
6. The CEO of the company is sending me eBay messages?

I did use their stock photo on the item, but have since removed it and only left only my photos.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I:

1. Ignore the message
2. Take my items down immediately
3. Reply back asking for more information about the ""ill-gotten products"" such as a police report or case number

Ebay,USPS SCAN AT ACCEPTANCE forms for end of day print out and how to print them at the end of the day.,"As far as I know, outside of generating the SCAN form during the last bulk shipment of the day...the method listed below is currently the only way to do this.  This also is good if your last item was a single label and not bulk shipping.

Under the new bulk label printing, you have the option to print out an acceptance SCAN sheet that you can hand to your postal employee when dropping off.  You can only generate this ONCE per day, 

Ebay tells you that you can only generate one per day but does not give the option on an easy to find place anywhere if you do not print it at the end of a label generating session.  

I was on the phone with eBay trying to asking how to generate one since the site crashed while generating my labels and I could not get that page to show up.  They had no answer, and the guy I talked to in the shipping department had no idea what I was even talking about.  and I accidentally discovered it while I was trying to explain my problem.  I even had to walk the tech on the phone through what I was talking about and he seemed surprised that it was even an option.

This info is good if you have generated multiple labels throughout the day without printing a SCAN form and still want to do so.
Also you do not get the option to generate the SCAN form if your last shipment was just a single item, even if you have created multiple labels throughout the day.

(Take note that **even though we are going to go through the motions, we are not ever going to be purchasing labels**.  If you have made it to the last page...do not hit the ""Purchase labels"" button)

1: Head to sold hub.  

2: Select paid and shipped(this will show you all the items you have generated labels for throughout the day)

3: Check the box next to 2 or more items.

4: From the ""Shipping action"" drop down menu select ""Print Shipping Labels or invoices""

5: Leave the circle filled for ""US Postage Service or FedEx shipping label"" and hit continue.

6: Now you are at eBays Bulk shipping screen, which you can only get to when buying bulk labels.  **On the top right of the screen there will be 3 options,** 

* Print labels

* **SCAN forms**  &lt;-------------This is the option you want to select.

* Go back to classic label Printing.

After clicking on scan forms, you will be able to generate your daily scan form to give to your postal worker.",4,9,2018-11-20,EBAY,0.053420860320329666,0.9175326228141785,0.029046470299363136

Ebay,i feel like i'm being scammed and need advice please,"Hello all,  
I sold an item to a guy on ebay, it was sent in medium flat rate box, very good packing, tons of tape, etc. It was delivered today, and also today the buyer opened a return (before messaging me, if that is relevant) to return the item because they said the box arrived ripped open and the item was gone but the packing was left in the box. I have included screen shots of their return request and the usps tracking info. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question/need for advice is:  
According to usps tracking info the item was delivered to the recipients house. If usps were delivering something that the box was ripped apart with no item inside, they would make a note of that on the box for the buyer, right? I can't imagine they would deliver something in that condition. Also, as a seller, isn't it my responsibility to make sure the package was delivered, and after it is delivered it is out of my hands? And if it were delivered in perfect condition but somehow after that it were destroyed/stolen, would I be/how would I be at fault for that? And finally, what should I do in this situation, and what would you do?

No warranty card, not the usual leaflets, just phone, charger and headphones.

Every reply just ignores the stuff she wrote and he comes with factory resets, cleaning the home button or now offering a $50 refund so she can have it quickly fixed somewhere herself.  
Ebay refuses to escalate the return claim and the seller refuses to provide a return address.  
I then suggested to check the serial number of the phone against Apples database and it came back as already registered and far out of warranty times - a second hand device but not a brand new and newer used one as listed.  
The seller still claims he sold a new phone and Ebay states they will check this new information.  
In the meantime the feedback for the seller had a massive jump in dead phone claims as well as buyers stating a new device was clearly used before.  
With that seen my sister contacted support again and was told the seller is now under investigation.  
Once the return is confirmed she will get a refund.  


Thing is now that for days she tries to get the return address but neither the seller nor Ebay dare to provide it.  
The seller still sells as usual and the negative feedback grows every single day by 3 or 4 complaints.  
Apple confirms the phone was far from new, so the fraud is obvious.  
I have to wonder about the handling here...  
Ebay so far refuses to step in and a week of useless exchanges with a seller does not make it better.  
Legally my sister is lost too because the seller used a Chinese Paypal account and has no real business in AU.  
IMHO that means it would be up to Ebay to prevent fraud, but instead they actually seem to promote untill too many buyers demand a refund from such a seller.  


There are tons of good sellers out there and these actions from dodgy asian sellers ruin it for both sellers and buyers.  
I am getting to the stage where I no longer can trust a power seller who has less than 100% feedback ratings.  
And it should be the other way around!

Ebay,Getting scammed need help/advice,"Long post here so thanks to anyone who read it and left input. Hi so i sold some hockey cards a couple weeks ago to a guy the next town over. I put the hockey cards in team bags. Team bags are basically ziploc bags that have a strip and they seal with tape. Anyways...i put the cards in team bags that were sealed and put them in a box with bubblewrap and taped extremely well. So the guy gets it and msgs me saying that the 5 most expensive cards in the box were missing. Soooo some how they fell out of the sealed bags and out if the sealed box but yet he got the rest...

I msg him back and say that they are 100% without a doubt there. Explain in extreme detail where everything was in the bags and even how they were layered. Hes still yet to msg me back.

Hes trying to scam me 100%

Also....seeing as he lived in the next town over and 5 minutes from my work. I messaged him and asked if he would prefer that i drop it off. He said sure and we agreed on a time. I go to his house at the set time and no answer. He texts me later and says ""guess i missed you"" then i ask if i should go back...he goes ""no no, just mail them"" 

I have pictures of everything sealed and texts showing him giving me the runaround.

Ebay,Need advice regarding seller,"OK, I'll keep this as short as possible:

I won an auction for an item on the 18th, at night. Paid for it right away via PayPal. Ebay's estimate for delivery was the Thurs 22nd to Fri 23rd. 

On Friday 23rd November, I messaged the seller and politely asked if had shipped the item out because it hadn't arrived at that point and I got no confirmation of it being shipped. No response from him.

Woke up today (Monday 26th) to find the item has been ""shipped"" - by checking the provided tracking number, seller placed an order with myHermes at 5am today for the item to be picked up from him. 

So he's ignored my original message, waited 8 days to ship the item, and now it looks like it might be the end of this week for me to get it. Not sure how to proceed here - I'm livid tbh. 

Any advice would be welcome.",7,6,2018-11-26,EBAY,0.03462044894695282,0.8987878561019897,0.06659168750047684
Ebay,Suspicious offers,"Hi r/eBay!

First time poster here. Anyways, I recently listed my first item, which is a smartphone. I have it set to allow for best offers. However, I keep getting offers well above the buy it now price...

Should all offers above the buy it now price be disregarded?

Ebay,"eBay removed my listing, and then deleted sold records for 40 people waiting for their orders. What now?","TL;DR:

I sell a item that has only one common place word to describe it, this descriptive word is trademarked. Someone complained despite my very clear description and images, that the item wasn't made by the brand (Many aren't on eBay), and then my listing got VERO'D. 

When they did this I noticed slowly my sold records were being deleted, one by one. I'd refresh and see this slowly happen.

Now to eBay, where I make $2,500+ in profit every month - I haven't sold anything in...months.

Problem is I had orders needing to be sent out, and orders I needed to list as shipped come Monday.

So exactly what do I do? 15+ year old account, 100% positive rep, except for this guy who complained...first order in thousands to complain in any fashion.

I explained that to him since he sent me an angry message claiming I was a liar because he seems to have gotten priority mail confused for expeditions handling time or priority mail meant I was going to ship it on a Saturday... or something.

Here’s what he replied,

“ You are a seriously ambitious young man. I think it is great.  
As one similar and retired at 41 because of that.  
Never even ever neglect one word ounce of info that will end your run
This won’t. It will come back as I spend a lot with eBay 

No one no one.  Even naive people who you may through a ball over their head I’ll always let you.    Don’t.   This was a lie on script a lie on shipment.  
So so so stupid that minutes after I complained you suggested , in writing , you will ship it usps priority.     You left a trail like Richard Nixon. 

Nothing to hide.  
Remember write little and “less said is best”.  Two things you lied to me about writing and add your obvious lack of shipping as suggesting than forwarding info showing after you got caught it changed to “‘shipped lied” to shipped

Ebay,how to deal with case of wrong delivery address and get paper proof from UPS,"I bought something on ebay and delivery address was at Portland, OR, the seller provided a UPS tracking number which tracking info showed delivered in same city.

Later I opened a case against seller about the wrong delivery address on ebay, but ebay asked me provide paper proof for this wrong delivery address, otherwise I will lose the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

Update: I got paper proof for this wrong delivery address from UPS and called ebay. 

ebay asked me file a report with my local police or law enforcement agency for which I didn't receive the item.

including the following in the report:

* Description of the item 
* Name of the officer filing the report
* Badge number of the officer filing the report
* Station location (city and state)
* Station phone number

Once I have the completed report, I need to send it to ebay.

Does anybody know about this kind of report? Are police able to provide it? How should I tell police about it, i.e. I didn't receive the item because of the delivery address is different with order address?

He posted that the item didn't arrive and that the tracking does not work, even though Its working fine. He was giving me hard times from the start and I even gave him extra, I think he is possibly a bit off in the head.

Ebay,"Sold an item, delivered and signature confirmation, buyer claims it didn't arrive?","So I sold a rather pricey item on eBay and insured it and required signature confirmation through USPS. The package gets delivered and I get proof of signature confirmation as well. I then get a message from the Buyer saying that the package couldn't have been signed for because he was not at home at the time of delivery and that he had someone go check for the package because he wasn't at home and there was no package to be found. I proceed to send him an image of the signature proof that I received from USPS and he claims that he didn't sign it and someone else did. He then proceeds to go through the process of filing a claim with USPS stating the package did not arrive.

Now everything from my end gives me the idea that he did indeed receive and sign for the package and at first, attempted to get a freebie at my expense. I think once he saw that I have signature proof in his name that he opted for the route of trying to get a freebie through USPS claim because he would lose an eBay case. While I think his claim will end up being denied because tracking shows delivered and his signature was signed for the package, could this come back on me somehow? He's been asking for information about the original address, state, and zip that it shipped from and I imagine more in the coming days. Should I not give this information? Or does it not matter because he will probably get denied on the claim anyways? Everything from my end looks like he's trying to get a freebie, but I'm not entirely sure what to do.

Ebay,Received a Negative Feedback? Send the buyer a very friendly message.,"After 7300 positives I received my first negative feedback yesterday. The feedback said ""You knew how to sell me a worthless product.""

When I looked at the item it was a diecast van which I'd sold cheap at auction because the transfer was upside down on one side. This was mentioned clearly in the condition description, item description and shown in photographs but there was nothing in his comment which would make ebay remove it.

The buyer was French, so I reached out to him in French with a very friendly email saying I'd just noticed his feedback and was very sorry but as I hadn't heard from him I wondered if it had been left in error or if he wasn't 100% happy with his purchase.

He replied a few hours later thanking me for worrying about him and it was nice of me to contact him. He said that if the defect was mentioned then he had not understood it or noticed it but his lack of vigilance was to blame. However he still considered that my shipping prices were too expensive because I had used the global shipping program.

Bingo! Got a double whammy of both him admitting he hadn't read/understood the description and blaming GSP shipping prices (which ebay will always remove). Called customer services and it was removed within 5 minutes to my relief.

I called ebay support - and they confirmed that it was supposed to be returned to my husband.  The rep I talked to was clearly perplexed when I told him that we don't do ebay, and don't even have an account, so how on earth did they have his name and address?

I did some googling and found a phone number for the guy that was returning the item.  Not using ebay at all, I was concerned that this guy wasn't going to get his money back if the item never reached the seller.  He was pretty cool about it, and let me know that ebay will make it good for him in any event.  When I told him I called ebay, he laughed and said we should just keep it, since ebay will take care of him.

The item was a garage door opener, but was supposed to be a something else entirely - that's why the buyer returned it. The rep said something about sending someone out to pick it up, but he was pretty vague about it, and we never heard anything more about it.  So bottom line, we're the proud owners of a garage door opener, or so it seems.

Has anyone heard of this type of thing happening?

TL:DR - Ebay item returned to a person that didn't sell it and has no account with ebay.",10,5,2018-11-30,EBAY,0.06799096614122391,0.9003583192825317,0.031650643795728683
Ebay,First class packages not getting scanned for days after drop off,"I am going to lose my top rated status because of this. I drop my packages off at a USPS distribution center and recently many of my packages have not been getting scanned for a few days after I drop them off. And the ones that do get scanned on time, more than 15-20% of them get delivered 5+ business days after first scan. 

It's obviously my fault I didn't change my guaranteed delivery dates and handling times to accommodate this but it sucks knowing I won't be a TRS come Dec. 20th. 

If I call them, will eBay show any leniency regarding this situation considering it is the holiday season?",13,5,2018-11-30,EBAY,0.42078202962875366,0.5580831170082092,0.02113477513194084

Ebay,"""Item not received"" - could I get some advice on what to do next?","Small time ebayer, I've never encountered this before.

A seller opened an INR case and asked for a refund. (Specifically the INR said ""didn't receive items, I want my money"".) According to the tracking number, the item was delivered two days ago.

I responded to the INR by entering the tracking information.

What else can/should I do? I'm preparing to eat the cost of that item, but I remain hopeful that ebay will side in my favor. Should I call them immediately or should I wait until the buyer responds?",2,4,2018-11-30,EBAY,0.025579307228326797,0.9094006419181824,0.06502004712820053
Ebay,"Buyer is a scammer, how long do I need to wait before I can put up a new auction?","So I put my ps4 on eBay last week and someone instantly bought it, asked for my bank details outside of eBay and asked me to send it to another country (1 day old account). Obviously a scam, I send a message that I only accept payments through eBay and he stopped replying.
Can I just start a new auction?",4,4,2018-11-30,EBAY,0.033820390701293945,0.9122942686080933,0.05388535186648369

Ebay,Any Success removing Selling Restriction for below standard?,"Has anyone ever had success lifting a selling restriction from Ebay because of Below Standard Selling standard. I was recently restricted because my account did not show improvement on defects. I miss understood the potential behind letting Ebay take a case in October that was the final straw. I offered a partial for an item I considered as described and feared it might not all be returned to me if I accepted the return. So I thought letting it go to Ebay was for situations where they would judge Not as described returns. I had a few cancellations because of items damaged in the hurricane this season that they have appealed for me post restriction but it wasnt sufficient to reverse the selling restriction. The month has been spotless and the December 20 evaluation + the appeals will drop my percentage to 2/3 what it was when it was restricted. This was my fault for not fully educating myself on what was a defect and the severity of them I understand that but is there any way or has anyone heard of a way to reverse this? Is it best over phone or should I work on a email explaining the mistake. When I started I didnt have a Printer for labels so I had to send them to a roommate and they would bring them home so I had a handful of late shipments by a day or so and thought that was the most important defect and the one I have since greatly improved. I never would have ever let a case go to Ebay if I knew it was bad for the standard and not an actual resolution option. 


If anyone has had any success removing a selling restriction from being below standard please  let me know",0,3,2018-11-30,EBAY,0.0717007964849472,0.8947563171386719,0.0335429310798645
