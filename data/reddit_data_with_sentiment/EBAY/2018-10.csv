Ebay,God bless these kind of sellers,,11,42,2018-10-01,EBAY,0.01579051837325096,0.599123477935791,0.3850860595703125
Ebay,A paypal loophole for sellers,"This happened to me recently as a buyer. But,  I think this is a nice loophole for the sellers. It goes like this: 

1. Seller offered a warranty on device x and sent me a defective device. 

2. I found this and contacted the seller

3. He offered free returns and sent me a shipping label.  

4. I returned the item. 

5. He claimed that he did not get the item. 

6. I opened a case with PayPal and mentioned my situation giving them the proof of shipping label,  and the tracking that it has been delivered. 

7. PayPal surprinsingly told me i must return the item to the x address (which happens to be the sellers registered PayPal address) and I will get a refund.  

8. Horror moment:  I looked at the shipping label Sent by the seller.  It had a different address though it was sent by him. He knows how it works. 

9. I called PayPal,  they said they cannot get my money back unless it's shipped to the address they mentioned. I should not have agreed on sending it back before opening the PayPal case. 

10. I am 300 bucks down,  and seller might sell the item somewhere else as broken or do the same to another customer. 

I understand paypal has their own rules,  I have to accept I am screwed here",36,26,2018-10-01,EBAY,0.08836899697780609,0.8775011301040649,0.034129902720451355

Ebay,First time returning item: seeking some guidance!,"As a buyer I am not sure if I have any grounds. I purchased a headlight for my car, and I’ve never purchased car parts before but I needed to fix mine. I brought it over to a friend’s shop, and it’s the wrong model, even after I specifically asked the seller if the connectors are the same, I gave them year, model, make, trim, everything...they told me yes the connectors are the same. 

The weird thing is, for car parts on the listing you can choose which model and engine and etc. your car is, and my car is listed as a compatible vehicle so I was like okay great. But just now I choose the exact same vehicle from the drop down and that one tells me it will not fit, even though the list said it did and the seller also said it did. 

So I requested a return, just to see what the process is going forward. Said item was not the right model. Seller tried to tell me I might have gotten the year of my car wrong and that it would have fit. And then after I told them I am 100% sure on model they said it’s probably because I don’t have the US model..and that it only fits a US model??? I’m from Canada. I really don’t think it’s different.

It took them awhile to reply back but ultimately they want me to pay return shipping (it’s through global ship so probably around $50CAD) and 10% restocking fee.

Just wanted to get some input on whether this is normal or if I can fight for seller to pay shipping? If not that’s fine I’ll pay it, I just want to make sure there isn’t anything else that can be done to argue the return shipping since I received a completely different thing, even though seller claims to be direct OEM replacement which it isn’t. 

Also how do I even send it back? If it was done through global ship, do I send it back through them? If I took this to Canada Post or places like UPS it would for sure cost more than the headlight itself at this point. 

Thank you in advance for the help. 

Edit: sorry forgot to add there is no return policy anywhere on listing.",10,2,2018-10-01,EBAY,0.02647508680820465,0.9360029101371765,0.03752204030752182
Ebay,"Item in the US, seller in Africa? Red flag?","Won an auction for a roughly $100 item, and according to the listing, the item is in Florida, but I notice after receiving a broken-English message via eBay this AM from the seller, roughly an hour after winning:

&gt; Hi. Thanks for winning the auction. Have you been able to pay please?
 
that the seller is from Saint Louis, Senegal, Africa.  
 
This seems like a red flag to me, but I'm wondering if I'm worrying needlessly. Planning on paying w/ a CC via Paypal. Thanks!
 
**EDIT:**
Just tried paying via Paypal, got this:

https://i.imgur.com/QeXAtwh.png
 
Never had this happen before...?
 
**EDIT AGAIN:**
Seller says he has talked to Paypal, that his account's set up correctly, and that they have no idea why anyone would have trouble paying him. Said Paypal suggested using Paypal Invoice, so he's now wondering if I'd be amenable to that.
 
https://i.imgur.com/0MDuAGI.png

*This* close to telling this guy to get bent... but I'm probably gonna play along to see where he thinks he's going with this. Guessing a bullshit link to a phishing page in an email full of bad grammar and misspelled words. 

**EDIT 3:** OK, so I turned down the idea of Paypal Invoice. Told him it's gotta be via eBay Checkout so I have eBay buyer protection or no deal. He says he can't get his Paypal account working with eBay. He tried to change the Paypal account to his brother's Paypal account and has relisted the auction so I can try again with an offer he'll accept at the same previous price. Just waiting for the new listing to go live, however long that takes (24 hours on new accounts, I've heard?). 

Meanwhile he cancelled the previous auction already at my request, so I'm off the hook now entirely--tho if the item and this guy ARE legit, it's still a hella good deal I'd like to snag if possible. So now I wait. He's actually been pretty patient and open to my suggestions, never rude or pushy, so I do wonder if they're honestly legit and just not terribly clued in.  Still, I'm wary. 

**EDIT 4: THE CONCLUSION^tm**
He switched the Paypal account on his eBay account, relisted the item, added a ""make an offer"" button.  Took until the next day for his link/auction to actually go live.  I made an offer for the same price, payment went through, then he tells me that the transaction caused his brother's Paypal account to become limited and he can't afford to pay for shipping with the Paypal stuff limited, and cancelled the new transaction/auction altogether.  I did get emails from Paypal and eBay about the full refund going through, so I don't _think_ I have any worries there.
 
I do wonder if I've still been set up somehow, but ehhhhhh. Was a helluva deal--I'm still wondering if he remained technically and/or legally obligated to sell to me?--but I guess I'll never know if it was all coincidental BS and actually legit or not.",7,2,2018-10-01,EBAY,0.07477083057165146,0.8934796452522278,0.031749557703733444
Ebay,The key to many things,"I recently subscribed to r/ebay and have seen a lot of people requesting help for various things and for the most part they are questions can be resolved with a little bit of advice. I have sold on ebay for over five years and have been selling full time for two years doing about 80k yearly. These questions are from both buyers and sellers. Most of what I am going to say is geared towards sellers as this is where my experience is and to many sellers, this means their career (or at least part time income)

This being said here are a few things I have learned.


Buyers

- Your strongest tool is opening a case. For most sellers, that is one thing that will make them get in line, ie... send an item, update tracking, work with you in general. However, please, work with sellers, because it is often their biggest stress as well. 

- If you feel you have just cause for a return, it really doesn't matter what the seller says, you ARE going to be able to return the item. If it hasn't arrived, you WILL get a refund. Just follow the steps outlined in the case. If in doubt, call Ebay

- The biggest thing that can screw buyers is waiting. If you buy an item, open and look at it. If it is a ceiling fan that you will be installing some months down the line and there is an issue, sorry, there is really nothing you can do. 

- Lastly, all of the above steps hold true assuming you do NOT ABUSE RETURNS. If you do, Ebay will label you as a scammer and you will be denied returns or refunds. What exactly is abusing returns? - I'm not totally sure, but to give you an idea, I purchased  a phone a few years ago and had to return it due to the buyer sending me a defective one, I did this one more time and again received one with a bad imei. Ebay said if I did it again I wouldn't be able to return the item. Take this with a grain of salt, as phones are a high risk category. 




Sellers

- Call Ebay

- Call Ebay

- Call Ebay

- I can't stress calling Ebay enough. If you feel a buyer is scamming you, call Ebay. If a buyer opens a case but doesn't give info or upload pictures, call Ebay (They WILL contact the buyer asking them to submit pictures), If you are worried about getting a transaction defect, but want to escalate a case as a seller, call Ebay. (They will literally say, ""because you called about this and seem to be working to resolve the issue, this case will have no affect on your seller rating"" Even if decided in the buyers favor) 

- Don't wait. This is one of those, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take situations. I can't think of a situation where calling ebay would hurt you. (Use the app to bypass the call system, reach the exact department you want, and have them call you) But if you wait, until it is too late (case is already closed, past a due date, or anything) the Ebay reps turn into totally different people. Simply stated, if you are on top of things, Ebay will be on your side. If you wait to long, it becomes a web of, ""I'm sorry sir, but..."", and, ""I understand sir, however"", to the point where the reps WILL hang up on you. It is both frustrating and stressful, and can be avoided by not procrastinating. 

- If an Ebay rep tells you something good or says something will be in your favor, work to get the situation buttoned up on the phone with them. Ebay doesn't listen to recordings of calls and will not generally honor something that was said by a rep. This can be very frustrating as you feel in the right, but still the outcome will be the same. 

- Although in general, these steps are helpful, in the end you have to roll with the punches. I have sold three computer monitors all of which were return and became total losses. The last one was the most blatant scam I have ever had (Never got a brick) The monitor was pulled apart and the lcd kept with their broken lcd tossed in the box. I was so mad about this and called Ebay multiple times and finally got connected with a high level american rep and he basically told me that I needed to use this as a learning lesson. Ebay sides with buyers and the best thing I can do is to find what works for me. I no longer sell monitors.  - also, some of Ebays new programs may protect against this in some cases.  

- Be professional and keep open communication with buyers. They are almost always more at ease if you are up front and get back with them quickly. Also, Ebay is much more likely to help you if you have been in communication. Even if the buyer doesn't respond or is making demands. 

- Lastly and more of an interesting occurence, you never know who your'e talking to. I once sold a very high end electric piano to a buyer. It was new and in perfect condition. It was packaged very well and securely. The buyer opens a return request and I immediately assume that there is something fishy. The buyer says that there was no damage to the box and I was wondering whether to approve it. I decided not to hassle him and immediately sent him a return label, and then a refund once received. After it was all over I sent him a message (all other communication was in the case details) thanking him for a quick return. He responds thanking me for being professional and good service.  At the bottom of the email was a custom signature and title outside the message box. I come to find out this guy is one of Ebay's VP's 
Soo.... there ya have it.

Ebay,"Seller promised something in a message (message directly linked with the item), but did not do as he promised.","Long story short, two weeks ago, a seller was selling a bunch of items for 100 euros or ""best offer"" + 15 or so euros of shipping cost. I contacted him (through the product page, the ""ask the seller question about the item"" section, so the messages are linked to the item, the entire discussion being labeled as a discussion about this transaction by ebay itself) to know what would be an acceptable best offer for him.

After a few messages back and forth, he said he would add a few items (and specified them) to the transaction if I would be willing to pay the 100 euros full asking price. We agreed on those terms, and I paid said full 100 euros + 15-something of shipping costs.

Fast forward 2 weeks: I received the package, and lo and behold, the things he promised to add weren't there at all. I contacted him to understand if there was any mistake or second package on the way. He answered that he decided not to send them, because he judged that the shipping cost (which I freaking paid) were too high to his liking. Once I hit him back pointing that I was the one who paid them, he simply said I had had a good enough of a deal.

Given the exchange of message was done on through the page of the product (the ""ask the seller question about the item"" section), and he promised stuff through that to complete the deal, do I have anything against him for blatantly lying to me to get his way to sell his items?

Ebay,Does ebay offer 'escrow' services of any sort?

Basically the situation is the person has a truck listed on craigslist but when I got in-touch they said they were now out of state, that her husband died and it was his truck, that it's still in the area and that it'd be delivered to me (via shipping company, about a 20min ride) ""to inspect"" and then choose whether to pay ebay or not - this sounds very shady but who knows maybe ebay is doing escrow like this?  It was left at a request for my name / address / phone # so that ebay could setup an ebay trust, presumably I'd have to put good-faith deposit into this account (but obviously *would not* if I wasn't 100.0% positive it was legitimate, ie navigating to ebay myself and actually contacting their customer-care myself to verify everything), but figured I'd ask here first if this is even a thing, ebay trusts (escrows basically), I mean it sounds funny but I can't rule it out and the deal is reallly solid so have to be sure it's bogus before crossing it off my list ;D",10,5,2018-10-03,EBAY,0.02621733583509922,0.9380702376365662,0.03571242094039917
Ebay,"Update on ""Any hope in winning this pretty open and shut case?""","Sigh, well here is the update post. No happy endings on eBay for sellers anymore.

Here is the original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/9jf0ai/any\_hope\_in\_winning\_this\_pretty\_open\_and\_shut\_case/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/9jf0ai/any_hope_in_winning_this_pretty_open_and_shut_case/)

Basically the TL;DR is that I sold a ""for parts"" CD player and listed it being VERY clear of everything that was wrong with it and priced it at hundreds of dollars less than the going rate for a working one. A buyer with 0 feedback bought it, and immediately wanted a return when he found out that the item wasn't working in all the ways that I described. I told him ""sorry but I don't offer returns on this item. Please read the description and the title and you will see that it was very clearly not working.""

He never responded and instead opened a ""Item Not As Described"" return.

I called eBay, they were no help.

[/u/Aircooledrules](https://www.reddit.com/u/Aircooledrules) wanted updates, so here it is.

**Now for the updates:**

As per your advice, I called eBay 2 more times after this until I got a good rep. First 2 reps were horribly unhelpful and basically said there was nothing they could do. The 3rd rep was actually very nice and seemed like she actually cared.

She told me *""it was obvious that the buyer didn't read the description and that this is clearly not an INAD.""*

She said to do *nothing yet, and that they would talk to the buyer and alert them to return it, but he will have to pay return shipping. If it got past the date, he would not be able to escalate it.*

Honestly I thought, not bad! I'd rather not get the return at all, but if he has to pay return shipping, great! Seemed like at least eBay was sticking up for me.

*I couldn't have been more wrong...*

Fast forward to today. The Buyer escalates the case and wins and eBay provided him a label and charged me... *Ok... what?*I was specifically told that the buyer would be paying for return shipping, and that they wouldn't let him escalate it so that I wouldn't get a defect on my account.

I get a call back from the same 3rd rep (she mentioned she would call me back eventually to give me an update). She alerted me that *I would now have to PAY* for the return because the buyer escalated and asked if that's all I needed. No that's not ""all I needed!!"" She wouldn't answer if they even reached out to the buyer like they said they would.

After arguing and telling them that this was CLEARLY not what we agreed on, she offered me a pity **$20 off my next purchase coupon**............. *WHAT?* I told her I wanted eBay to pay for the return shipping or the buyer as it doesn't seem fair I was lied to, she said there was nothing she could do, and they the $20 coupon was all I could get.

She told me there was nothing she could do about the defect I would get either. I finally got her to remove the defect after continuing to arguing with her some more that this wasn't my fault, which means they lied to me about not being able to do anything, I guess? Although she didn't even say she would remove it, just ""I will put a note in the case that it should be removed""

The audacity of eBay at this point... I don't know really what to say. I cannot believe eBay anymore. In the past I have lost several cases that I should have won, but they usually told me it why, and what I could have done to prevent losing them in the past and didn't straight up lie to me.

I marked the item with ""no returns"", I marked the condition ""for parts"", I was told by a rep themselves that this was clearly not ""INAD"" and was lied to by 3 different reps in what to do, and yet in the end **I got an INAD return, Possibly a defect on my account and had to pay return shipping anyways...**

I'm sorry eBay, I've been selling on you for over 5 years now, but I just can't do this anymore. At least tell me the truth before you screw me over... I'm moving all my applicable listings to Etsy right now, and closing down my eBay store until I hear things improve for sellers, though I'm not sure if they ever will.

Ebay,"Could this be a scam, or am I just being paranoid?","Four days ago I received an offer for an acoustic guitar. The buyer has been a member since February 2016 and has a total of 11 positive feedback. He is located in Sweden, so I declined his offer and explained that I do not ship guitars overseas. This was his reply:

&gt; Thats ok, Im going to visit my father in California in a few weeks so you could ship it to him...
&gt; 
&gt; What would be your best price?
&gt; 
&gt; Kind regards,

My Response:
&gt;eBay doesn't offer seller protection on items shipped to an address other than what is on the buyer's account. This loophole has been used as a common tactic to scam sellers, and is not a risk I'm willing to take. I would recommend you locate a friend of your dad's with a well-established eBay account to purchase the guitar and hold it for you. I will accept an offer of $850 with free shipping. Good luck.

This morning I received another offer (for the $850 I specified) and this message:

&gt;Hello again.
&gt;
&gt;I have changed my ebay account shipping address now, and sent the offer for 850 USD. Im so glad I found your (guitar model) here. I had mine for every gig I did for 13 years and last week mine was stolen...

Sure enough, the address was now set for Los Angeles, addressed to him in care of who I'm assuming is his mother/grandmother. I went ahead and accepted the offer and am now awaiting payment. I googled the c/o along with the address and it came up as legitimate on several white pages websites. I even found a woman of the same name in LA on Facebook, and it seems from her birthday cake photos that she is over 100 years old.

Is there anything that seems odd here? Am I just being paranoid? If I ship to the address specified, is there anything that could go wrong as long as it is properly tracked and insured? I'll also take photos of the packing process for evidence in case it's needed. I'm considering calling the phone number I found of the c/o later on today to see if I can speak with that person and confirm that they know about this.

Ebay,How do I report someone running a scam?,"Hi, sorry if this is a dumb question but I can't figure this out.

A few weeks ago I bought some Warhammer figures on eBay for about $100. When I received the figures they were completely broken. The seller put a bunch of fragile, assembled figures into the box with smaller, heavy boxes inside the shipping box. The seller did not use packing peanuts, foam, bubble wrap, nothing. Everything just smashed about during shipping.

I contacted the seller about a refund and he said we could file an insurance claim on the shipment (the figures are worth over $100), but I said if USPS asked I would tell them it wasn't properly packed. Over a series of message he tried to claim the figures were sold ""as-is"", but when I called bullshit he tried to intimidate me into accepting the broken figures. Ultimately I said he either needed to give me a refund or I'd contact eBay and they'd sort it out. He gave me a refund, and gave me the money to ship the figures 

But all of that left a really bad taste in my mouth. My theory was the figures were originally broken, and he sent them like that to try and claim they were damaged in transit. I reviewed the figures and saw discrepancies that all-but-confirmed the ones he shipped me were not what he listed. So I thought he might try and re-list the item at some point and run the same scam on someone else. So I decided to keep an eye on his auctions.

Today my suspicions were confirmed. He re-listed the auction and used the pictures from the original auction that depict them as being in perfect condition. So I went to report him to eBay, but I can't find anything that lets me give them actual information. The ""report item"" button only lets me submit pre-listed options, none of which list ""Seller is a moron who thinks he's pulling a fast one."" And there's a phone number for general support, but if their website options are like that I'm guessing the phone system is the standard corporate rigamarole

How can I get in touch with an actual person? I'm the kind of person who will always tell the restaurant if their dinner wasn't cooked right, but I know a lot of people have trouble with that and the idea that he's trying to run the same shit with someone else makes my blood boil.

tldr: How can I tell eBay a seller is trying to rip someone off the exact same way he ripped me off?",10,6,2018-10-06,EBAY,0.10566811263561249,0.8705747723579407,0.02375711500644684
Ebay,Could someone out there build/crowdfund a third party search engine for eBay... so that we can find the ACTUAL lowest prices again?,"Well, it seems like lots of other people have this problem... but eBay isn't going to fix it (higher prices are more desirable for them), and no other solution is forthcoming. Sellers are now being permitted to use bait and switch tactics to obscure what the actual selling price of an item is, so that people looking for Buy it Now items can no longer tell at a glance if the item is available for cheaper through another seller.

For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about: for years, one could usually find the lowest price on something in under a minute by simply ordering by lowest price. But now that sellers have the ability to sell multiple different items at different prices through the same listing, they can do stuff like this: ""cable #1: $7"", ""cable #2: $7"", ""stupid plastic keychain: $0.99"".  And so now when you search for cable #1, that listing will show up ahead of another listing that offers the same cable 1 for $2 due to the keychain being cheaper than $2. 

In short, prices are being associated with the incorrect items on the search results page, and many sellers are obviously doing it intentionally to prevent buyers from discovering the lowest prices (or, for inattentive shoppers, even confuse people into ordering the wrong item.) This tactic is known as [bait and switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_and_switch), which for centuries has been considered by our legal system to be a form of fraud but I guess those rulings were made before the internet and search engines were a thing...

Basically, nowadays if you want to try to find the lowest price on something, you not only have to manually flip through each page looking for lower prices, but you have to actually click through to the listings and select from the dropdown box the item you're interested in. To be thorough, it would take literally hours to verify what used to take less than a minute to do. No one has that kind of time, so most people end up just shrugging and guessing about whether or not something is a good price.

Am I the only one who is *really* bothered by this? I'm dirt poor. Being able to Buy it Now stuff (often unbranded stuff from Asia) has been really helpful for me over the years. With the amount of shopping I do, being able to find the same item for $2 instead of $5 without spending hours checking is significant.

The technical solution would be straightforward: offer the ability to order and filter by maximum price instead of just the minimum price. I'm pretty sure a couple clever CS students could put together a proxy search tool in just a weekend or two. It would be trickier to make it really user friendly or cloud based, but couldn't we... I don't know, get together crowdfund someone to build such a thing? Be it a website or browser extension or whatever... I, for one, would chip in to support the creation of such a tool, even though I'm dirt poor, because I know it would pay for itself within a couple months.",5,6,2018-10-06,EBAY,0.0695989653468132,0.9041703939437866,0.026230691000819206

Ebay,eBay getting worse and worse for sellers?,"I've been an eBay user since 2002 and an active seller for at least a decade. During that time eBay has made many changes, few of which ever struck me as good ideas and many of which have been frustrating, particularly for sellers. Now it's reaching the point where I'm not sure I want to bother selling anymore.

* **Completed Items:** I spend a lot of time researching sold / ended items when determining pricing. Used to be that clicking a completed item in the search results took you directly to the original listing. Then, eBay changed it to show similar items actively for sale at the top of the listing page and forced you to click an extra link to see the original photos. Now, eBay takes you directly to an entirely different item that's up for sale (""We found something similar"") and gives you an option to click again to see the listing you originally wanted to view. None of this stuff helps me research pricing. How hard does eBay have to pimp their active listings in the name of a few extra sales?

* **Buyer Feedback:** Years ago buyers and sellers could leave positive &amp; negative feedback for each other, which gave both an incentive to cooperate. Several years ago eBay decided that sellers should only be able leave positive feedback for buyers, which gave buyers the upper hand in making unfair demands and leaving poor feedback without fear of retribution. Even if a buyer refuses to pay, a seller can't leave negative feedback.

* **Returns:** Used to be that, as a seller, you could choose your return policy and that all sales were final unless you chose to accept returns. Now eBay not only forces you to accept returns for any reason, but they also make you pay the return shipping cost. For a huge seller this might not be a problem, but as a small / part-time eBay hobby seller with typical sales between $500 and $1,000 per month, it's a major hassle.

* **Final Value Fees:** They always go up, not a surprise there. But years ago eBay would only charge a final value fee on the item's sale price, not the shipping cost. They changed that policy because some sellers were supposedly abusing it by listing low BIN prices and padding the shipping cost for the difference, and now eBay charges final value fees on shipping costs as well. Nice way for them to pull yet more money out of the seller's pocket and put it in their own.

eBay seems to be increasingly resorting to unfair and improper practices in order to squeeze out an extra few bucks of profit, and almost invariably sides with buyers in any dispute, which has led to all sorts of abuse that's well-documented in forums.

At this point I'm no longer posting new items for sale and have closed my store, and will likely stop selling for good after my current inventory is depleted. eBay is still a great place to buy stuff, but as a small seller it's just not worth the hassle.",67,54,2018-10-07,EBAY,0.07540696114301682,0.8959904909133911,0.02860253117978573

My assumption is they are also using a stolen Paypal account and funneling the money out of Paypal into some overseas bank.,20,18,2018-10-07,EBAY,0.08575401455163956,0.8929392695426941,0.02130674012005329

Ebay,Question about dealing with a dishonest buyer,"So I have sold my product to a buyer, payed for delivery to the buyer and of course ebay gathered the final value fee from me.

And after a while the buyer wrote me that the item I sold him was ""superglued"" and etc. (bare in mind - I sent him numerous photos with accurate representation of the item he was willing to buy and the item itself was in a good condition, not new, but preserved).

So he (at least I think so) wanted to blackmail me to cut the price of the item. After I refused, I contacted Ebay and told them about this problem, then I found out that the buyer contacted ebay as well for the refund (since he failed to bargain and blackmail me for a price drop), well and Ebay took matters in their own hands and I refunded the price which was paid by the buyer and he sent me back my product.

I contacted ebay and they told me that they will refund the final value fee, but I still have a question - can I get a refunded for my delivery expenses? Because it triggers me a bit that the buyer was a dishonest person who tried to gain advantage and after everything I am the one who got financially damaged from this deal.",13,2,2018-10-07,EBAY,0.30044370889663696,0.6666483879089355,0.032907888293266296

Ebay,I'm a seller - I have two odd/interesting transactions,"Hello,

I was hoping for some thoughts on these two transactions.

1. The buyer bought 6 of the same product from me all in one order. Not very odd and I was pretty happy. The odd part - they picked local pickup despite the address being about 5 1/2 hours from me. The address also comes back to an ""Aramex International Courier."" I tried messaging them right away, but it's been over a day and I haven't heard anything. They have quite a lot of good reviews, but their eBay name is pretty odd (something kind of inappropriate). They have already paid as well.

2. Someone offered me a lower price on one of my listings. I met them halfway on their offer. They declined and then immediately bought and paid for the item at full price.

Any thoughts on these? Thank you!",24,15,2018-10-08,EBAY,0.1429838389158249,0.8066251277923584,0.050390951335430145

Ebay,I'm an eBay seller and I'm not sure what to do about a transaction,"I sold my Canon T5i on eBay for $325 plus shipping (UPS Ground) on Thursday around 12am  and shipped it out the same day around 10am at a UPS store. The package was delivered to the buyer the next day around noon and a couple of hours later, an eBay rep messages me saying that the buyer has not received their item and that I should check in with UPS. The buyer tells me his situation and says that he asked neighbors and filed a police report for the missing package. I messaged the buyer and reassured him that I will update him once I have called UPS. Called UPS the next day and they set up an investigation that will take 8 business days. Then I messaged the buyer that I will update him on the situation on whatever UPS says. The buyer requests a refund today, but I message back saying that I would not be able to provide a refund until the investigation has been assessed and finalized. I've never been in this situation before and started selling on eBay since last month.

TL;DR - Buyer pays $325 for camera and I ship it out. UPS delivers package next day (UPS Ground Shipping) and buyers tells me that they have no received the package. Call UPS about package and they open investigation. Buyer requests refund today. Tell them to wait for UPS to assess the issue.

Ebay,Does asking too many questions signify a problem buyer?,"I've often found it does, myself. 

On the one hand, questions are generally good. I prefer buyers ask questions before rather than after buying!

But there comes a point where it's too much. PARTICULARLY a) questions that are blatantly obvious - often just from the title and b) persistent 'but that's what I want!' questions.

e.g. something like:

&gt;Will this 75-78 alternator fit my 82 car?  
&gt;  
&gt;No  
&gt;  
&gt;But it looks just the same, are you sure it won't fit?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, I'm sure  
&gt;  
&gt;If I buy it and it doesn't fit, can I return it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Please don't do that. It won't fit.  
&gt;  
&gt;But my brother looked at it too and he also says it looks identical.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's not identical, the bolt-hole placements are different and the amperage is different.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think I could make it work, though. If I buy it and it doesn't fit, do I have to pay return shipping?

Etc.

Yeah, that's a pretty blatant example of 'problem transaction brewing'... But often-times just a peppering of question after question has ended up in a bad situation. To the point we now often just block folks after the umpteenth question.

Anyone else find the same (or not)?

Ebay,Canceling Potential Scam Purchase,"Recently, I put an item up for sale (not auction) that cost over $300, and after it was purchased, I scrutinized the buyer's account a bit more closely and noticed three things

1. The ship to address was a FedEx shipment location, not a residence
2. The email address was an auto-generated disposable address.
3. The buyer had zero feedback and the account was created the same day as the purchase.

Those three things together set off alarm bells in my mind, so I canceled the purchase and refunded the money the same day. Now, two weeks later, the buyer is leaving negative feedback claiming that I waited for a week to cancel the purchase and never notified him, which is blatantly untrue.

Ebay,eBay Plus has screwed me over.,"On the 26th of August I signed up for a trial to eBay Plus. I usually cancel trial subscriptions immediately but this time I failed to do so. This “free trial” lasts four weeks.

Roughly two weeks later (half way in to the trial) I cancelled my trial and signed up to Amazon Prime instead. A little box came up on screen, asked me to select a reason why I was cancelling, and then after I selected, a new pop up appeared stating I had cancelled my subscription and would still be able to access my eBay Plus Membership until 26th of September, 2018.

Two weeks after I cancelled the trial, on the 26th of September, I woke up to a PayPal email stating:

“You sent a payment of $48.99 AUD to eBay Marketplaces GmbH”

The description was “eBay Plus annual membership fee”. 

I was confused about this as I had cancelled my trial already. 

I went to the eBay Plus page again and saw that my membership was still active until the 26th of September, 2019. I cancelled again, repeated the exact same steps as I had last time, and this time I received an email confirmation, which I had not received last time. I immediately contacted eBay via the online chat. 

The woman I talked with on chat told me that to cancel the ebay membership I needed email confirmation. I told her that I didn’t know that when I originally cancelled it, and only found out when I had to cancel it for the second time.

The customer service rep (Kim) then replied (this is a direct copy and paste of the transcript),

“In this case, I need to escalate this to our management since the membership is non refundable … Please allow me 24 hours to get a respond from our management if we can be able to refund your subscription fee.” 
This conversation took place on the 26th of September. 

Two days later, I had not received the response she claimed I would within 24 hours. Therefore that day (the 28th of September) I contacted ebay support again. I spoke with ‘Jessa’ who told me she would connect me with the “eBay Plus department”. She then connected ‘Louise’ to the chat. 

Louise confirmed,

“Okay, understood. You have cancelled your membership but you were still charged and you want to get your refund.”

She also stated,

“I can see that you have been charged. I will be escalating this and send a request to our superiors for you refund.” 

Once again, these are direct copy and pastes from the eBay Transcript on the 28th of September. 

Later that day (28th of September) I received an email from eBay,

“I just got response from our management and since your account is eligible for the Google home mini item, we have to make sure that it wasn’t sent yet so we can process the refund for you.

Please allow this process within 3-5 business days. My request for you to get a refund for the membership is still in progress. Also we would like you to understand that this process is already beyond our policy reason why we would ask for your patience about this matter.”

Apparently charging people for things they don’t want is fine, but refunding someone for a subscription they have attempted to cancel is not within policy. 

It turns out my account was eligible for a Google Home Mini promotion, where if you don’t cancel your trial and actually pay for eBay Plus, they send you a Google Home Mini. I was not aware of this promotion, and I understood that they would obviously need to make sure they hadn’t sent it to me before they refund me.

I waited until the 4th of October before clicking reply to the email, 6 days after they told me they would refund me within 3 to 5 days. I sent,

“Hi, 

Is there any word on my refund yet?

Thank you

Sent from my iPhone”.

I got a typical “thanks for your email, we’ll get back to you soon” response immediately. This email stated “and in most cases, you’ll get a reply within 24 to 36 hours.”

Once again, this was on the 4th of October. 

About an hour later, I submitted a PayPal dispute. As of writing this (The 9th of October) I have yet to get a response via email OR PayPal, which was 5 days ago.

Today, the 9th of October, I received the Google Home Mini in the mail. I decided to check the tracking number that was on the box.

The tracking number was CREATED on the 4th of October, but Australia Post did not receive the item until the 5th of October. 

This means that eBay told me they would ensure the Home Mini was not sent out, and refund me in 3 to 5 days. ONE WEEK after they told me they would make sure it wasn’t sent, they sent it anyway.

Why is it that eBay would send it out a week after telling me they would check to make sure it hasn’t been sent? 
Could it be perhaps that they advertise the Home Mini as a $79 value, when in reality, they have been sold BRAND NEW for as low as $30 on eBay? 
This means I couldn’t even sell the device to recoup my membership fee, due to them being sold for so low. I can’t send it back because I would have to pay postage and I don’t have a return address, and I also can’t use it because I can’t open it in the event ebay actually decide to get back to me.",2,4,2018-10-09,EBAY,0.04898187518119812,0.9191942811012268,0.031823874451220036

Ebay,Am I being scammed?,"I sold something about 2 weeks ago and to this day it was one of the coolest things I’ve ever flipped. It was signed and dated 1952 and had a note written on the back of it from the artist to the family.  It was sent in its original 1952 frame, in great condition. The buyer messages me 4 days after it was delivered to tell me that they took it to a professional framer (so they dismantled it from the frame and destroyed it) and found that it was just a print and not what she paid for. I have absolutely no way of knowing this is true, as I never took it out from the original frame (back in the day, they didn’t have the frames we do now with the metal pieces you can slide. They had paper backings that were stapled or glued on) and I am floored that she would even consider a refund after destroying the product. She even admitted in her first letter that she knew I was unaware of this, but that she wants her money back anyway.  I know this was an original. I had it myself for a long time, and I bought it from someone who also had it for many years handed down from their own family. 

What can I do?  I don’t know if any of her story is true, but if even part of it is, how deserving of a refund is she if she destroying the product? For all I know she could be sending me pictures of a print she made herself. There’s no chance I could ever resell it again. She’s also admitted to me not being aware (if I’m in the wrong at all) but she’s punishing me anyway and wanting a refund.  I’m just wondering what eBay will do if I get them involved? Award her?

Ebay,eBay Case Drama,"I purchased a monitor to replace one of my monitors.  I purchased this on Tuesday October 2nd.  The time was sensitive on this item.  The item was guaranteed for Saturday October 6th.  I made other arrangements after having not received the item on October 6th.  I did not receive the item since the seller downgraded the shipping from Priority to Ground (whole other issue not relevant.)  

I was instructed by eBay support to open an item not received case on October 7th ""in order to protect my ability to get my money.""  I opened the case using the ""report late delivery"" and specifically mentioned I wished to return the item instead of keep it and get the $5 voucher.  Well, the item was delivered on October 8th (Monday) and the seller promptly uploaded tracking info causing for the case to get closed in conjunction with calling customer service.  The case was closed on 10/9.

Well the issue is, when I called back first thing on 10/9, was they instructed me to open an appeal.  So I did, I contacted eBay and spoke to a supervisor on the phone who told me that this was incorrect.  Now, I am unable to open the proper case in order to get a refund since ""an eBay money-back guarantee case is already open.""

The eBay customer service claim that their system has to ""update"" and they should be able to open one tomorrow.

Ebay,Good tip if someone is acting fishy,"So I sold an iPhone 7 about 3 weeks ago on eBay. Yesterday the buyer contacted me saying he had just tried it out and the headphones didn’t work. I said that was odd, I use them all the time. So he took it to the Apple Store and they told him the port was corroded and they could fix it for $60. He said it was no problem, just send him $60!

Well I know my phone was in good condition so I said no. Just send me back the phone. He insisted that this would be easier. 

And here’s my tip. I went into his feedback (all 100% positive) and messaged as many as I could before eBay told me I had emailed enough. All I asked was if they sold him a phone with water damage. I was thinking one had and he was trying to fix that phone not mine. What I got instead was everyone reporting the exact same story back to me. Some had even paid the guy. Feedback can’t be changed, he only did the scam after feedback had been left. But that good feedback? You can still click the usernames to get the real story.

The other is the auction ends today (in 5 hours) but deliviery is stated to be 26th to 29th, is there a known scam to draw out the time between payment and ""delivery"" to have more time to get away?

Ebay,Cancel or return item I have not received.,"Hello,

About a week ago, there was a limited edition item that was sold via direct sale from a large website (Hasbro).  After website issues, it was not clear if my checkout on the website was completed.  The items began appearing on eBay and I completed check out at a marked up price.  Note: eBay seller had to go through the same process.  This was the only way to get the item.  I assumed they were one of the lucky ones who were able to complete checkout.

Hasbro contacted me to let me know they would be able to complete my original order from the website.  I contacted the eBay seller and requested the item be cancelled.  The seller responds promptly, admits they are still waiting for the item themselves (and it not sure if they will receive it), agrees to cancel it, and then asks if I could complete a ""return item"" request.

Is this correct?

If the item has not shipped, is there an option for the seller to simply cancel the order and issue a refund?  Or will I have to select ""return item"" for an item I haven't received for the seller to initiate the process?

I'm afraid that if I select ""return item,"" I will be on the hook to return something before I receive a refund.

Please advise.  
Thank you.

Ebay,I've been wrongly accused and probably convicted of fraud from a fraudulent seller.,"Hello, eBayers. Some months ago I ordered Diablo 3 Collectors edition.  
I payed around 300$ for it, expecting everything to be alright. The box was delivered with a little delay - it seemed unopened as it had foil on it. I logged in to my Blizzard account, I opened the game, I tried to register the code in Blizzard's site and to my surprise the code was invalid. I contacted the seller and tried to solve it with him, but he just didn't comply, so I tried using the eBay Money Back Guarantee. They told me that I should provide proof that the code is invalid. I send the immediately screenshot of the code and screenshot of the chat with Blizzard, but they told me that I need a legitimate document of 3rd party game supplier, providing their opinion on the issue. I immediately contacted the biggest game supplier shop in my area - ""Pulsar"". They were very responsive as well - I went there with the game - they took it, tried to register it, and they had the same experience as me - they got the Invalid Code message. After that they contacted Blizzard Support asked them what is the problem and if the code was already registered. Surprisingly, Blizzard told them that the code is non-existing in the database. ""Pulsar"" then issued the document of proof that the code was not a valid one. What happened from here on is, I provided eBay all that was needed - they sided with me, I sent the game back to the seller and I got refunded.  


Little did I know...  


Two months later (Around mid January) I got a mail from Germany. I opened the letter and it stated that I was being accused of online fraud and that on December 14th (which apparently had already passed being mid January) I should defend myself in court with a lawyer, providing evidence that I am not guilty. Normally I don't have a problem with that, but as I got the letter month and a half later after my court date, I didn't know what to do. I also didn't have the money for a lawyer , so with these two things in mind I didn't even bother. I don't know what to do now. I'm afraid that I probably am convicted for something that I was a victim of, and I don't honestly know what to do in this situation. Has anyone had anything similar? Also any advice will be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR - I bought a game. Code was invalid. Ebay needed proof from a game supplier company. I got a legitimate document from the biggest game supplier in my country with proof that the code was indeed faulty. I won the case and I got my money back. Two months later I got a letter which stated that I am being accused of online fraud. The date I got my letter was month and a half later after my supposed court defense date, so I couldn't defend myself. Now I am probably convicted for something that I was a victim to.",16,2,2018-10-11,EBAY,0.18709024786949158,0.7903987765312195,0.022510986775159836

Ebay,New to EBAY — Should I be wary buying a used Chromebook?,"I’ve always been a little nervous about used items because of quality worries. I want something that works and will last. The Chromebook I found is $150 lower than retail value, so that seems pretty great. The eBay seller has 17 reviews going back to 2012 I believe, all positive. So, it seems like a good choice. I want something that will last at least 3 years, hopefully 5. I know that could be a lot to ask for a used Chromebook. I’d like to contact the seller asking about how much the Chromebook has been used and how long they’ve had it, but it looks like there is no place to do that.

If I end up buying the Chromebook and it does not work, under EBay return policy or whatever, will I get a full refund of the item *and* shipping costs? I’d like to not pay anything for an item that doesn’t work. Hopefully, it is as specified. Is there a place to see more info?

Ebay,Buying a new phone.,"So I’m looking into getting a Samsung Galaxy S9+. I was looking at retailers websites and just reading up on it. Then I went to eBay to look for cases, that’s when I saw someone selling the phone new. It caught my eye because it’s 300 dollars cheaper then what the retailer is selling it for. The eBay seller has it listed as factory unlocked and labeled new. So obviously I have a couple of questions about this if you guys’d wouldn’t mind helping me out?

1- What does factory unlocked mean?

2- If I bought the phone off of eBay, could I still take it over to my provider and swap over my number and contacts?

Ebay,"New seller, I have some probably dumb questions about Auction/BiN/Best Offer","I am going to list 15 collectables separately. Each sells for about $6-25, so a decent range there. I was going to start them all as an auction with a $5 start, use the BiN to price the items the highest they normally go for, and enourage people to make offers to get to a fair price.

But now I was reading, and I believe that if I create an auction with a BiN and offers, if there's a bid on the auction all offers are cancelled? What would be the best way to get decent sales for each now? BiN + Offers alone or Auctions with BiN and no offers?

I want the offers as I will ship several together if a buyer buys more than 1 and accept more of a discount, but I don't want people to be scared off buy a high BiN price. And with the auctions, I don't think they'll all actually get bid on for an entire week...

Ebay,I am getting annoyed by what appears to be frauds and from always one province in China on eBay. Scale model kits.,"Lately, the last couple of months, I started seeing unusually low prices for certain types of items (scale model kits), combined with items I ordered that end up being returned to sender because of bad address (according to local mail service). Sometimes these items are simply lowest priced items (the ones I order ofc), other times, I see prices so low they seem too good to be true. I feel bad about even writing this, as I don't want to encourage anyone doing this either. :|

&amp;#x200B;

Only thing I can do it seems is reporting the items listed, and asking for a refund.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these sellers reside in the same province in China, and somehow the estimated delivery times seem artificially long, so these items end up far behind in your purchase history if you usually buy stuff off eBay.

&amp;#x200B;

Presumably, these are sellers that try to exhaust the buyer's patience in not responding. Luckily it seems that I will always get my money back.

&amp;#x200B;

All these sellers seem to reside in **GuangZhou**, so be careful if you see lowest priced stuff from this place when buying scale model kits. Usually you can see complaints in the negative feedback section talking about items never showing up.

Ebay does not appear to be concerned with this, or isn't willing to discuss this with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: My last item shipped from this area in China arrived to my country in Europe in a record six days, but without being delivered to me.  ..estimated time of delivery for that item.. Oct 29 - Dec 07.

Ebay,"Sold an item on eBay, a week later the buyer asked for a refund but wouldn't tell me why and dodged communication, Ebay ruled in their favor once a week had passed. Ebay sent them a refund, but the item I received in the mail wasn't the one I shipped out.","Full story!

A few weeks ago I posted to r/ebay because someone had purchased the phone I was selling. The buyer seemed suspicious, but a few helpful people explained that the person could have used guest checkout, and it wasn't as bad as I was imagining it to be.

So I shipped out the phone.

They requested a refund, wouldn't explain to me why (apart from the ""item not as described.)

I explained to eBay this was possibly a scam and followed the same layout as other scams, however they sided with the buyer and asked me to pay for the return shipping.

A few days ago I received the item and eBay sent them a refund. 

The problem is, they sent back an old, 90's looking UV filter for a camera. Not a phone. The item was also sent from a different address and city than the one I sent the phone to. 

What are my options here? Should I attempt to contact the buyer, in case it was an accident? I filed a claim and eBay asked for a police report. Is that the only way to go? 

Thanks in advance! 


UPDATE: I’m sorry for the confusion in the comments! I also didn’t mention I’m no longer at the apartment I sent it from,  I’m now overseas. I couldn’t file a police report online for theft/mail fraud, nor was I able to physically get my hands on the package.

However, the bit of good luck! My Paypal is linked to my credit card, so when Ebay tried to draw the money from PayPal, it drew it from the CC. Called up Capital One, explained the situation. I found out last night (my last night) that the package they sent the UV filter in was JUST big enough for the filter and not big enough for the phone. So I have proof that the package I received was too small to fit the phone, and the package info matched the tracking info, so Capital One refunded the money, and would ask Ebay to reimburse them. 

I would have preferred to do this trough eBay but I’m just happy it worked out the way it did.

Ebay,Freight forwarder return - scam attempt?,"Hi everyone 

So I sold my iPhone on eBay and sent it to the address eBay provided, with signature. It was delivered at 11 today. At 12:30, the buyer says that the phone doesn’t charge more than 1% since 3-4 hours and wants a return. Phone was at 17% in pics, topped off when sent.

-Shipping address is to a freight forwarder, was signed for by company (MEEST America)
-no way the buyer could have had phone that long in possession in first place

So this just doesn’t add up. Sure I have seller protection in that I sent it to where eBay said. But there’s another post here where somebody was sent something else as a return- that’s what I’m worried is the case here. 

I have the IMEI of the phone but haven’t shared it with the buyer. I asked him to supply it.

&amp;#x200B;

Buyer responded with ""I will be fine with at least a $5 refund""....which made me wonder if this was about a refund due to a damaged item or just a refund to get his way, because $5 dollars, really?

Before I responded, the buyer opened a refund request in which I automatically closed after explaining everything that happened prior to that point and  Next thing you know, BOOM!

Ebay,Selling postage help...,"Ok, so I'm new to selling things on eBay, and this will probably sound like a pretty dumb question but I just want to get it right. It should be on the reddit 'explain like I'm five' tbh... 

Basically, I have read on eBay about postage and that you can print off a sticker for delivery and you can send it off. It sounds that simple. I've googled it and it says the same. However, how do you determine how much the postage costs? For example, I bought a dress the other day with £3 delivery and another for £2 delivery. How did they get these prices? Did they go to the post office first for a postage quote, or did they weigh the items themselves and it's a prepaid label to print off themselves? Are there selection boxes with weights to pick a label and the price, once it has been sold? What about size? I don't want to sell an item with postage included, only to mess it up and end up paying myself at the post office. Or is this how you do it, the postage is included and then you use that money to send it off/pay at the PO when you've already been quoted? 

Im so sorry for the rambling but it's just confusing. I don't want to sell something, be an idiot and mess it up, and have a disappointed customer. I'm new to selling and I want to know how it works instead of winging it and losing money. I *know* it will be simple...

I went to my delivery office the next day I spoke to my postman.  It's not there, he didn't have it.  I trust them they know us well. We're rural it's a small area.

&amp;#x200B;

I've opened a case with RM but the label eBay generated only covers the item for £100.  So even if that finds in my favour, I'm out £188.

&amp;#x200B;

eBay don't care. Today they refunded the idiot who doesn't know phones get hot.

I rang them, I can appeal the case but I need to wait for RM's investigation, and in the end I'm only going to get the £100 if that.  

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do to contest any of this?  Why did eBay only offer a return label worth £3.00, I'd have been happy to pay the full Special Delivery price if it had been an option.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do to get anything back? I have no phone and no £300.

I have an 18 year old 100% positive account from casual selling and buying, they must know I'm not suddenly turning to fraud?

Ebay,Should I cancel the sale of a sold item to avoid scam?,"I put up an Android-type digital music device for auction on ebay that sold for about $250.  The buyer has been making me paranoid from the get go: no feedback, new account, didn’t pay within 3 days of purchase (I had to open an upaid case but he/she just paid today), has a very strange name almost like a business, and the note on the payment was very strange... they don’t understand the condition of the item and it’s in very broken english.  I’m very sketched out, and I know that ebay doesn’t really side with sellers.  This is the message he sent to me:

Ebay,Did I just scam a scammer?,"Someone on eBay was selling a gaming laptop for $100, and I thought why not, it's covered by eBay.
I paid for the item, and was waiting for the payment to go through. I get an email saying the usual: ""account was compromised"". I did the customer support thing on eBay, and request refund. Few days pass by and I check PayPal, and noticed that the scammer didn't claim my money, so I cancelled the payment, and I got my money back after a few days. In the meantime, I got an email from eBay saying that the scammer contacted customer support as well saying that he didn't sell the item to me, and that he's leaving it to customer support to solve the issue.
Today, eBay came to a conclusion and gave me money (as if they were giving me my refund). I checked PayPal and saw that I was given $129 AUD. That means that I just got double my money back.
Did I scam the scammer? Or did I scam eBay? Should I leave the extra money in my PayPal account just to be safe incase eBay takes the money back?

Ebay,"About to get scammed by buyer, help!","I am a relatively new seller with little experience( 84 ratings and 100% good feedback) and I think I am about to be scammed. I need help from experts like retrose1 , as I do not know policy well enough to protect myself from people who prey on new sellers and abuse eBay policy in order to rob them. This transaction is worth more than I earn of eBay in a month.

 

The buyers feedback is 100%, but they have 2-3 transactions with a single seller over and over. This makes me suspicious that this might be a scam account, accumulating fake feedback through shell acounts and transactions.

 
 
I sold a preorder for an EXTREMELY LIMITED convention exclusive action figure set for $275 with free shipping in June. The item would be released in August. I updated the buyer on the items shipping status and offered to cancel the item if the buyer did not want to wait. As soon as I received the set from the convention on August, I shipped the item out, even packing in an extra accessory or two for the buyers patience. 

 

Here's where it gets sketchy. On August 28th, after my package had arrived the buyer stated that they got a package at their parents house but didn't know if it was from me or not. They stated they were not there to open it and they were going to have their brother open it to ""make sure everything is ok and no damage or anything"". He then asked for the tracking number, which I gladly provided. I then sent a message to the buyer to let me know when they'd gone over everything/checked the package and that I packaged everything with extreme care.

 

I got no response until October 17th, when the buyer messaged that they just opened the package and found the packaging with a knife mark as well as sticker residue on the side of the packaging. The buyer inquired if I had cut the shipper box open with a knife when opening it and left a sticker residue. The buyer provided pictures that did indicate a ling scratch on the side as well as the residue. The thing is, I didn't use a knife when opening the manufactures shipper and the set actually slide out from the top of the box and not the side, where the damage was. Furthermore, it came packaged completely in bubble wrap, leaving no chance that the item would have any superficial damage, let alone one on the side. Since this was an inexspensive item, I inspected the collector set throughly before I shipped it and I took pictures of the surface. No scratches or residue to be found. 

 

I am afraid of losing a case and having to either receive the damaged item(it's value plummeting due to the damage) or being scammed by the return. I need help from experts, please help!

Ebay,"Sold a $2000 dollar item, seller returned it damaged, eBay screwed me. I did learn more about their policies though...","TLDR: Sold a grid tied inverter for $2k + $250 shipping.  Item has to go freight because of possibility of damage.  Buyer returned it via FedEx and it was damaged.  eBay gave me only a rebate of my final value fee.

Some details: the inverter weighs about 140 lbs, and when I sent it, I charged a flat fee of $250, with the lift gate, and residential delivery, it cost me $350 to send it to the buyer. There is a BIG orange sticker on the top of the box, where it is opened, that says ""Ship via freight only.""

When the buyer opened a return, saying the bought the wrong item, it was automatically approved.  I immediately emailed the buyer and explained they must return it via LTL freight as it will get damaged.  They sent it fedex... and it was damaged.  Lots of holes in the box and well it is just screwed.

I emailed the buyer (With zero feedback) and they never responded.  I opened a case with eBay and they sided with the buyer claiming that there was no evidence that the buyer caused the damage.  I explained to them the details, and they could even see proof that the buyer sent it via fedex, and they even saw the large orange sticker and my email.  Still sided with the buyer.  Why?  and I quote, ""The buyer is allowed to send the item back using any service they want.""  

I asked them a pointed question, If I sent it to them via fedex and it was damaged, would I be liable?   Yes.  If they send it to me and it's damaged are they liable? No.

I was able to get a hold of a member of the high value claims department leadership (that's what they're called in case you're wondering) and they were only able to refund the final value credits ""as a courtesy.""

My takeaway is never sell anything on ebay that has even a chance to get broken in transit.  You can insure it when you send it, but if the buyer returns it and it breaks, that's on you. 

As a result of this fiasco, I'm actively transitioning to amazon, and let it go.  Don't know if they're better, but thus far they haven't screwed me as hard.

Ebay,Beneficial Surprise as Seller- ebay auto-refunded buyer out of its own pocket,"TLDR: I never even received the return request from the buyer - only an email stating ebay took care of everything.

All info I think may be relevant: 

* Sold a new clothing item to a buyer with an established account. 
* Item listed with free returns but have had zero returns in the 60 previous sales. 
* Buyer bought the wrong size and filed a 'ordered by mistake' return request where they request they exchange the item for the correct size
* Ebay immediately refunded them out of their own pocket and informed me of such in lieu of notifying me of a return request
* Buyer immediately purchased the correct size
* Buyer has since made 3 more purchases so I think everyone is happy with this outcome.

Here is the email I received from ebay: https://i.imgur.com/2Fkm1Nl.png

The wording confused me as to who paid so I checked my return requests. This one had already be marked as completed with the text 
&gt; ""This return is now completed

&gt;Good news! we've paid $10.10 to the buyer and closed the return so you don't have to do anything. The buyer can keep the item and you won't be charged.""

I have not received any transactions in either ebay or paypal outside of the normal ones from the original sale. I'm certainly not complaining, but I do want to be on top of this for tax reasons.

Ebay,Someone tried to scam me so now my account is under scrutiny and I have to pay fees for a transaction that didn't happen?!,"I listed an iPhone on eBay and got a message that clearly hadn't read my listing at all. They were interested in buying it for their son who lived elsewhere. I knew it was a scam straight away but on the off chance it was someone who just didn't understand how eBay works I replied that all the info they were asking for was in the listing and that if it was for someone else to be sure they entered the correct delivery address. I figured that would be enough to let a scammer know that I know how that scam works but they replied asking me to send a PayPal request to their email. I replied ""I don't understand. What do you want me to do?"" in the hopes that they would word it a bit more plainly and I could report them. That was it.

Today I got an email from eBay saying that they'd detected rule breaking activity on my account and if it happened again in the next three days then this would happen:

&gt;- Final value fees may be assessed when you have offers to sell outside of eBay, even if the item didn't actually sell.
- You won’t be able to list or buy for up to 7 days.
- Some or all of your fixed price listings may be hidden from search results for 7 days, and fees won't be refunded.  
- You won’t be able to send or receive messages with eBay members unless you have a recent transaction.

They also say that I have to pay the fees for that sale but it never happened. I did cancel the listing but only to change it from buy it now to auction. It was relisted immediately. And the views on it are quite low compared to last time which makes me worry that they've already hidden me from search results.

I need to wait until tomorrow before their chat opens again so hopefully I can sort it out but I'm a bit worried now. I recently quit my job to sell on eBay full time.

Ebay,Absolutely fed up with eBay. Worst buyers anywhere.,"Just want a place to rant - I am so sick of eBay and absolutely fed up. They offer no tools to sellers in terms of facilitating the sale and dealing with non-paying bidders. eBay needs to implement something where the bidder must input a credit card number or paypal to bid and then payments get processed immediately after auction ends.

I have had my last 3 auctions all fail because the top bidder would not pay:

1. Listed a drone for USA only. Winning bidder ended up being from Portugal and would not pay the additional shipping cost to ship internationally after I tried to be flexible and make things work
2. Re-listed the drone, and winning bidder never paid or communicated after a week
3. Re-listed again, and winning bidder has said he bid by accident and will not pay

I don't even get the option to leave negative feedback. Lose-lose all around and am completely frustrated.

Ebay,Sold laptop got a message from another ebay account trying to change shipping address,"So I sold my laptop and it was paid for but the buyer has no ratings history and his account was created the day before. I get a message the next day from another ebay account making some excuse about moving out of town to take care of their sick father and to ship it to another person in another state. The account also has zero ratings and was literally created on the same day as the message.

I'm not sure how paypal works anymore. There is no email next to transactions and it tells me to use ebay if I want to contact the buyer. I also can't tell if the address is paypal verified or not. Do they still do that? The transaction however says its eligible for seller protection though, whatever that means.

I contacted the buyer through ebay and they verified the original shipping address that paypal lists. If the buyer was a phony, I don't see the point of the second account messaging me. The address also goes to an airforce base.

Is it just coincidence they both have zero ratings and in fact the transaction is legitimate? The item is already paid for so debating whether to ship it or not.

Edit: original buyer asked to cancel order so I did. I could have shipped it earlier but I sort of waited it out a bit over the weekend to see if it was BS or not. I still don't know if the original buyer was legitimate or not. Time to relist...",16,10,2018-10-20,EBAY,0.05273401364684105,0.9210813045501709,0.026184730231761932
Ebay,Buyer opened an unfounded return. Rep says I’m fine to ignore it for now.,"TL;DR: eBay rep says to wait out a return request and ignore buyer. Says that at the end of the return request time-frame a case will open and be auto-closed in my favor by him personally. Sound fishy?

Hey guys, I just wanted to run a concept by you and see if anyone has been through this before and if it sounds right or not.

I had a buyer open a return case. I don’t accept returns. His reasons were that I did not say the item had replaced parts. It very clearly stated this in my listing though. I called eBay and the rep told me after some ‘investigation’ that it is clearly a case of buyers remorse and that I will not be expected to return it. He told me to ignore the buyer (who was being belligerent to me anyway) and wait until the return request period is over. He said that once the request time is up that a case will open and that he would close that case in my favor. I went over what he told me carefully and repeated it back to him. The rep went a step further to inform me that he would be closing the case in my favor personally when the return request time frame was up.. so I said ok and hung up.

That was yesterday and the return request says to respond to the buyer by the 23rd on Tuesday. It seems fishy to me. I feel like if a case opens that they may just auto-side with the buyer (as eBay is known to do) and I won’t have time to correct it. Or worse, that they say something along the lines to the buyer that I didn’t respond in time and they just refund the buyer without needing him to send my item back.

Has anyone gone though this that can shed some light or offer confidence to me? Should I call eBay back and explain the situation? It’s $200 so I’d rather not eat it and I’m not the kind of guy that likes to do returns without a fight if the buyer is at fault because I think it’s ridiculous that we live in a try before you buy society and I don’t like being part of it as a seller. I can’t afford to have my business and live that way. I’m not Walmart. 

Thank you for your time!

Update: So, after driving myself insane with this case over the weekend I called eBay this morning. My concern was that I was being lied to and that after Tuesday a bot would auto-close this newly opened case in the buyer’s favor, even though the buyer is in the wrong. Today I talked to a lady and explained everything. She told me that there we “NO NOTES” on my account from the previous rep. She said she can see a call, but no notes were made. She said that she would have to submit a request to her supervisor and pull the previous phone call to verify what I was promised. I feel there should have been a note left on my account. I’m also curious how the first rep had the authority to make that promise to me, but the second rep had to submit a form to her supervisor to do anything. Either way, I’m now waiting on a call. She said she’d call back either today or tomorrow. I asked her to leave notes concerning our call, but I can’t verify that she did. If I don’t hear back by tomorrow morning I will call around noon and update again.

Update 2: Ok, I’m sorry for the delay! Last Tuesday night (on the 23rd, the night before the case was supposed to open) around 9:30pm central, I was sent an email saying a case was opened, which was directly followed by another email saying that the case had been closed in my favor, stating that the item was not covered by eBay’s money back guarantee. I wish I could say if it mattered how many times I called them or not, but I can’t help feeling like it did help some, considering how bent these sorts of things are normally towards the buyer’s favor. It’s been about a week and I haven’t heard anything additional about it. So far so good concerning this one. I sincerely wish there was better communication and records with the service reps I talked to. Though it worked out I’m not sure exactly how it came to be that way.",22,4,2018-10-20,EBAY,0.06027238816022873,0.9087086915969849,0.0310189388692379

This guy contacts me over 1 month after buying a laptop from me claiming the screen stopped working and that somehow (even though he has had it for 30 days) it's my fault.

Ebay,Dissatisfied with an item I bought from China. Please advise.,"Ok,  so I ordered something I've really been wanting from a Chinese seller.  The price was ~$55 shipped.  It arrived fairly quickly,  which I appreciate.  Only 11 days. However,  the item has some issues:

1. It was sold as new,  but one of the item's accessories wasn't present in the package.

2. The primary accessory object has a disappointing defect and is only partially functional. 

3. The main item itself has a mechanical feature that only partially works. 

Now,  this is an item that is primarily for display, but the functionality of it is part of the appeal.  I'm not satisfied with it in this condition for the price I paid for it. 

So, I contacted the seller and they have been responsive.  They offered me $15 compensation,  but even at $40, I'm not happy with the item. 

Can I force them to accept a return and will they have to pay the shipping costs? 

When I mention a return,  the seller seems adamant that they don't want to go that route because it's expensive,  which leads me to believe they know that it'll cost them.  Probably more than $15. 

I'm just not sure what to do?  Should I ask for $35 compensation,  because the item would have to be like $20 for me to be ok with it?",14,4,2018-10-23,EBAY,0.04684239625930786,0.9085003733634949,0.044657256454229355

I have been selling for myself on eBay for about 6 years now, but have been involved with selling for someone else for 8 years prior to that. I sell a little of everything but mostly collectibles and sports fan merchandise. What I really enjoy about what I do is the whole process actually. I really enjoy going out and shopping for those little things that I think people will want, an example being maybe a figurine or toy from their childhood that they forgot about until they see my listing and they have to buy it because it reminds them of a happier time. I guess I like the idea that I have something that somebody wants enough to buy from. I like to do the cleanup and picturing of the item. Then the research and listing. I enjoy answering questions and then get a thrill when I hear the cha-ching of my phone go off indicating that I sold an item. As with everything, there are some bad points that I have seen businesss wise go downhill concerning eBay in the last few years especially. Sales have slowed down at times, there are more people looking to get something for nothing, eBay rules have changes considerably., etc. But I still enjoy what I do and wouldn't change it

Now the game was definitly not the one I sent, this one had what looked like bite marks and the game was scratched.

The controller was the next red flag, I opened it to put batteries in it, when I noticed someone had tampered with the security seal or whatever it is. So I grabbed my s/n list and completely different numbers. Also the dpad does not work on this one and was filthy and reeked of cigarrete.

I called eBay and spoke with a representive and let them know what happened and he told me to speak with buyer first but that he had noted the call made.

I messaged the buyer through ebay hoping he would admit what he did and I was willing to offer him a partial refund, he paid 467 and I was going to refund him 276. He started accusing me of lying and faking the pictures, stating that he worked two jobs and had no time to play and didnt even open the game case. He then told me he would let ebay handle it and I have not responded since.

What I did do was report him and call ebay again, they said I could call back on the 25th, but I want to know what steps I should take?

Also his reasoning for returning the xbox was invalid, I checked it right away and it works completely fine.

I was planning on calling the US Postal Inspection Service tomorrow to put in a fraud report.

Ebay,People keep clicking buy it now on my sale listings and then never pay,"I've only started selling recently on ebay after having no problems buying items. Selling so far is a nightmare not only how confusing the ebay website is and the bugs I keep encountering where a page is missing and I have to go back and reload the page.

Anyway my problem is people keep buying items which takes my listing offline, some of them have been fairly obvious scams saying they want to pay more for the item than i listed and to email them separately off ebay, which i've thankfully googled and seen it sounds like a scam. I've now done my 5th listing and someone has bought it in the usa (i'm in australia), they have a good rating and feedback and asked me to send them final invoice which i have. its been 4 days with no response after messaging them and now i've flagged it to follow up. What really pisses me off is i got charged $168.80 for the listings people never bought which put my bank account in negative and then i got charged $10 by my bank. I'm still waiting and ebay says it should be back by friday - up to ten days. I'll then need to wait to transfer it from paypal to my bank account which is just a real pain in the ass.

Is what is happening to me common? It seems to be yet the ebay staff sound like its the first they've ever heard of this. the website is so confusing and inconsistent. I really hope someone come sand disrupts and destroys their business because its that bad.

Ebay,"Former top seller here, wanna know how easy it is to force a return on a buyer?","1 - Order item

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Request return

&amp;#x200B;

3 - REFUSE to upload any proof or acknowledge any of the sellers claims, just let it go on until either the seller accepts the return, or it goes to a case

&amp;#x200B;

4 - Since you are the buyer, you will win. Nevermind if the seller uploads proof you're lying, as long as YOU don't upload proof that you're lying - you will win.

&amp;#x200B;

5 - If it goes to a case (which will rule in your favor if it does, since you are the buyer and buyers dont lie) then when the tracking shows as delivered the funds will be immediately pulled out of the sellers account, with no time allowed for inspection.

&amp;#x200B;

6 - Oh, and if you decide to send back a different item (or rocks) and the seller calls to say you shipped back an item damaged, or rocks (this is if it has already gone to a case decision) then eBay will say to the seller ""Sorry we don't accept photos as proof"".  Nevermind if you opened the package at USPS with a federal employee as a witness, eBay will STILL say they do no accept photos. However, previously they did not even bother to request photos from the buyer, they simply take them at their word (because buyers don't lie).

Ebay,Return fraud case reversed and closed in my favor with FULL Refund!,"So I sold an item in August. Shipped it to the buyer after he paid very quickly. Before I shipped it I confirmed with the buyer to keep all of the packing materials in the event of damage from USPS. The shipment was fully insured. It delivered and the buyer had it for 13 days. He emailed me saying it was damaged in transit. I offered to pay for the repairs and file insurance claim. Buyer didn't like that option and eBay closed the case in his favor and took the money back from me to return it to the buyer. I received the item 2 days later. Upon inspection, it was damaged (by whom is unknown) and no longer functioned. I filed an insurance claim. They offered about 10% of the items full value without proof they damaged it. I appealed the case with USPS. They requested the photos and damaged packaging be brought to a local postoffice to the buyer. he ignored the request and USPS outright denied my claim stating the recipient never replied. All this time, I was trying to appeal the case with eBay. Once I had the denial letter from USPS, they would let me file the appeal. 2 days later it was decided in my favor and eBay returned all $1950 of the money the buyer paid.

persistence and documentation are key.

Ebay,I think I'm about to get hit,"Earlier this week I sold a couple items to a buyer who, at first, lowballed me on the offer.

Today I get an email from him saying that he wanted to let me know that the items arrived horribly broken and he doesn't want to send them back but he wanted to let me know because ""some people can leave negative feedback for that sort of thing.""  I checked his feedback....and wow he's left a lot of neutrals and negatives - and the positives are pretty soft, sometimes saying that the seller was great about compromising or fixed the problem.

While I know that items can be broken in the mail (it's happened to everyone), I've sold many of these with no issues.  Also, they're not very fragile but I still bubble wrap, place in a carboard crush pack, bubble wrap again, bubble envelope then a Priority Mail bubble mailer.

Ebay,"Won item on eBay, seller now claims item is faulty?","Hey guys,

I just won a listing on eBay which clearly says the item is used but fully functional, and photos also show the item working.

The listing ended not too long ago, and I have paid for the item, however the seller has messaged me claiming that the item is now faulty, and that I can ""cancel the order"".

My gut feeling says he's lying - the item had a buy-it-now price which was considerably more than what the item sold for. Not only this, the same item has been relisted multiple times by the same seller, and all has sold for around the price I paid and then appeared back on eBay a couple days later.

My feeling is that he wants to relist the item in the hopes someone will pay the buy-it-now price, but that's stupid considering it was also listed for auction with no reserve.

What should I do from here? My temptation is to request the item is sent to me and if it is indeed faulty then request a return through the normal system, having verified the fault. Is this a good idea?

Thanks!",13,5,2018-10-27,EBAY,0.03525790199637413,0.9074340462684631,0.057308048009872437
Ebay,[UK] Do I have to wait 8 days to involve eBay in a return?,"I’m trying to return an item that doesn’t work to a seller who shipped from China (I don’t mind things from China if they actually work). eBay auto accepted the return, but I had an email saying the seller couldn’t produce a returns label and to contact the seller. 

I contacted the seller and they acted like they’d not even seen my return request. I figured they’re a high volume seller so probably have multiple staff. No big deal so I explained in another message. 

To start with they tried to offer just under half of the cost as a gesture of good will. I refused since the item is completely useless and I want to exercise my right to return. Because it’s defective, they should pay the return postage too. 

Today I got a reply saying would I leave positive feedback since they are refunding in full and they will be making a loss. 

Firstly it’s not my fault they shipped a bad product. Surely a volume seller can cope with such a loss, especially as it probably cost them pennies (it was very cheap but I have a very tight budget). 

Secondly, it sounds like feedback extortion to me, since I’ve not been given the refund and they appear to be waiting until I agree to give them positive feedback. 

Can I report them at this point? Not that I can figure out how since there is no report option on messages...


Also, sellers, please don’t start messages with just “dear” with no name following and then sign with a single letter. Their messages are coming across super unprofessional because of that.

Ebay,Does this warrant leaving negative feedback?,"I purchased an item from a seller about a week ago, and used a Packstation as a delivery address. It's like a delivery locker that's open 24 hours a day. In the order, I used the saved Packstation address on file.The selller's listing stated that the seller does deliver to Packstations.

The item was returned to the seller due to delivery problem. I asked the seller for the tracking info and for the address that he used for the delivery. He sent me a photo of the returned package, and it was clear that he didn't fill out the form correctly. The Packstation customer number was missing, and even the post deliverer wrote this on the shipping box. He demanded an additional fee to reship it (to a different address at both our requests). Since I paid by bank transfer, I reluctantly paid the extra shipping cost since it would be very difficult to get either a refund or force the seller to ship.

Since the error was his, I find this unfair, but I also didn't want to have to deal with the potential case of losing my money and/or the item entirely. Does this warrant negative feedback? Neutral? Or does anyone have any other suggestion? I haven't left feedback yet, and was wondering how I should handle this situation.

Since then I've completed several purchases without issue using Buy It Now and checking out as a guest. Yesterday, however,  I ordered something and today received a couple emails from eBay.

Dude, seriously, I've done nothing except pay for items. I've never had any issues with any sellers and all my payments have always gone through. There are several things that I can't find locally and eBay is the only place I can find them with reasonable international shipping. What can I do?

Any advice is appreciated.

I'm pretty sure they can't leave me negative feedback, but hopefully the emails they sent are enough proof to have it removed if they do. I'm going to block them once this is complete. 

I absolutely can't stand beggars. Don't buy my items if you can't afford them or the shipping! I'm not going to send my items into the ether to save you $10 at my expense when you're only spending $15. What are the odds that you'll subsequently claim they ""didn't arrive,"" etc. and otherwise be a huge, worthless pain in my ass? About 100%. No thanks. No one needs a sale that bad.",6,2,2018-10-31,EBAY,0.0826030969619751,0.8837817311286926,0.03361513838171959
Ebay,Where do I pay the shipping fees for labels I've printed?,"Started selling recently and I am so confused on shipping labels. My recent buyers obviously pay the full price of item+shipping and then I'm able to print the label and get their package out, but when I receive my PayPal amount, the full amount of item+shipping is what I receive. Where do I pay for the shipping labels I've created for these packages? I see the monthly 'due as of today' eBay invoice with fees for listing boosts and what not, but no fees for shipping.   


Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!",2,2,2018-10-31,EBAY,0.022410161793231964,0.9203377366065979,0.05725203827023506

Ebay,Paypal odd refunds (never requested)? With open dispute associated. Anyone else got these??,"I have not requested any refunds or opened any disputes. I only buy stuff, so this balance is odd.

I just logged into my Paypal account and there is 2 small refunds;

$0.02 AUD
$0.03 USD

In each it says '	There is an open dispute associated with this transaction.'

'Visit the Resolution Centre to view status.' but there is nothing there.

Something about incorrectly calculated exchange rates is in the summery description.",4,2,2018-10-31,EBAY,0.2720423936843872,0.6939246654510498,0.03403294458985329
