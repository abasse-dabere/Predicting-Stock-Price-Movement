Ebay,"I received a ""free gift"" from ebay - am I being scammed?","OK, so a package arrived today by courier in an unmarked white van. The driver knocked the door, told me that he needed to see ID before he could deliver it, I showed him ID and he gave me the package. I opened the package and this was inside:

There's no way this is from eBay - look at the logo. The inserted piece of paper was clearly printed on an inkjet desktop printer, it doesnt have my eBay username on and just generally looks suspect.

Also, the package was addressed to my name but with my middle initial included (eBay doesnt have that listed on my account) and my postcode doesn't match the one I have on my eBay account either.

There's no courier logo on the label, so I dont know who delivered it (I assumed it was something else that was being delivered, so I didn't think to ask the guy), and I'm a thirty something male so I very much doubt anyone would bother to send me a bracelet making kit if they had any idea of my eBay buying history. Here's the label, with my address covered for obvious reasons:

The only thing I can think of is that my employer has me on sick leave at the moment after I sustained an injury in the workplace. I've been off waiting for an operation for a few months and their insurance company is covering my wages until I'm back at work. Could this be anything to do with them, checking that I am actually at home and not out doing whatever I'd be doing if I wasn't stuck at home?

I have literally no idea what to do about this at this point, but it freaked me the hell out. Is it a scam? My employer's insurance company trying to catch me out? An actual eBay promotion (I doubt that). Please help!

Sincerely,

Freaked Out

UPDATE: eBay says its nothing to do with them:

Ebay,I tried selling my Ebay stuff on Facebook and cleared $700 the first day,So my Ebay sales have been lumpy and lackluster so far this 2016 holiday season so I picked some items I thought might do well on the local buying and selling groups on Facebook yesterday morning and posted them.

Ebay,A bit of good news for a change,"I was inspired by a comment recently that we tend to see the worst of the worst posted in here, so for a bit of a change from the usual doom and gloom; I have a few happy ebay tales to share.  

I'm a buyer for business buying almost exclusively in PC &amp;  Laptop section, with a little dabble in Mobile phones when I'm feeling particularly brave so I am quite used to the shady shenanigans that go on in those sections (especially when ti comes to grabbing a bargain).  

So the first one: I grabbed a listing of half dozen laptops on a BIN, no Offer, no Auction, however in the description it mentioned a discount if you buy more than one, and to make an offer of X less.  The price was already pretty low so I just snapped them up and paid.  

Woke up the next morning to a message from the seller thanking me for buying and letting me know they had refunded me the difference from what I would have saved from their offer, and a substantial refund for the postage as ""it would cost nowhere near that""    Were talking in the region of £100.  

Sucha  good deal I couldn't even be mad about the shitty packaging damaging one of the laptops.

____
Second one, a smaller bunch of laptops, made an offer for all three, seller accepted and I paid staraight away.  Maybe a week  later I message the seller asking for an update or tracking and got no reply, next evening I pulled contact number and text them with no reply.  

A day or so later I opened an INR, when presented with the choice of do I want my money or the laptops I went to check out the sellers profile and see if I missed something... I hadn't and it turned out that I had bought a laptop from them recently, which was the exact same laptop, using the exact same pic/title/description.  as I'd alrady had a laptop from them and it was perfect I decided to go with the option to keep waiting for the item.  

Fast forward to two days before ebay would have stepped in and the seller adds tracking, but still no communication, however the tracking is not showing as active on the courier site, I end up on the phone with the courier who confirm a collection is booked and let me know the weight of the booking [it matches what I would expect]  late that night the tracking goes active and it is two hops away from delivery,  next day they arrive all perfect just like last time.  I messaged teh seller again to let them know they arrived and ask what happened; and they replied that they had been on holiday and someone had let them down by not shipping (could be bullshit but my gut says it is true)   

____

And my latest one is a single laptop listed by a zero feedback gibberish named brand new account in the early AM local time:  a used boxed £900 ultrabook listed for £55 with free p&amp;p  

My jaw hit the floor when I opened the package and realised it was that, I almost felt bad.

Ebay,Think I'm being scammed please help!,"On October 14th the buyer purchased two canon lenses from me through separate listings.  He asked if I would combine the invoices and ship together which I did.  There was a little back and forth when he tried to haggle down the shipping cost for both, but we finally agreed and all was well.  He received the items and the funds were made available a week later.

Fast forward to November 19th.  I get an email saying a return is requested for one of the lenses for $165.01 (the total invoice for both lenses was $344.51).  The same day I get another email saying the request has been closed as this ""dispute"" has been escalated to a claim through PayPal.  In the month in between I did not receive any communication that there was a problem with the lens.  

Paypal immediately took the full invoice amount of BOTH purchases from my account.  I plead my case to PayPal saying there is only a ""problem"" (there is absolutely nothing wrong with the lens) with one of the purchases.  On thanksgiving they close the claim in his favor.  So he sent back the supposed defective lens, but He was refunded the total of BOTH purchases.  I immediately appealed the case stating that if he was asking for the full refund he should have returned both lenses.  I then called PayPal and they asked for and I provided evidence of only receiving the one item.  Yesterday I received an email asking to file a police report in order to proceed.

What are my next steps?  Follow through with the police report?  It seems like he escalated the claim through PayPal instead of continuing with eBay so he could get the full amount back and keep one lens.

Ebay,eBay appears to have a sort of silent infrastructure in place whereby high volume sellers can have bad feedback removed,"edit: Let's disregard the fact that I said ""high volume"" in the title because I'm not really saying there's a conspiracy at play. However, I do think that eBay might be a little too comfortable removing negative feedback because it suits their interests.

Over the course of many years and many transactions, I've chosen to leave bad feedback exactly twice.

I've chosen many more times *not* to leave bad feedback despite items being slightly misrepresented because I know it can hurt sellers.

Both times I've left bad feedback, both times on high-volume retailers' accounts, my feedback has mysteriously disappeared.

Both times I've called customer support, I've gotten the line, ""Sorry, your feedback shouldn't have been removed. We are going to coach the representative to never do this in the future."" I know that people in call centers are not stupid.

The funniest part... the most recent time my feedback was removed, the seller had *another buyer's feedback removed the same day* (or perhaps he convinced the buyer), and the buyer's complaint was the same as mine.

I understand that being a seller is tough, but as a seller myself, I wouldn't dare misrepresent an item, and lately, the big guys are getting a bit brave with the sort of junk they send, and there's this growing eBay culture/mindset of, ""You shouldn't dare give a seller bad feedback because they have it so rough.""

And I think that's bullshit. If you send something knowing that it's garbage -- and I've gotten Blu Ray discs with holes so large you can see completely through them -- you deserve bad feedback.",42,17,2016-12-02,EBAY,0.23499585688114166,0.7421321868896484,0.022871926426887512

Ebay,"Trying to stay on the high road, but would appreciate your witty comments","Background: we've been on eBay for years, TRS, have 100% positive feedback and loads of comments regarding our excellent customer service.  

Got an email from a buyer the other day, ripping me up and down for sending the wrong item.  Actually called me a moron and told me I should not be selling anything if I can't send the correct item.  

The item comes in different variations, and the packaging is very similar, so even though I'm pretty diligent in confirming things before I send them out, I figured I must have just grabbed the wrong thing, so I immediately accepted the return.

Had he just emailed me nicely, I would have told him to keep the wrong item and sent him the correct one, but he was just so nasty, I sent him a label to send it back.

So today, I get the package, and this is where it gets really funny.

Inside the package is the item he claimed I had sent him, along with a packing slip from a major retailer where he actually purchased it.  On the back of the packing slip, he wrote that he wanted to return it to them, because they sent him the wrong thing, specifically stating that he got the variation I sent him.

So his plan was to return MY item to them, and THEIR item to me, claiming that we had BOTH sent the wrong thing.

I immediately called eBay and believe it or not, they agreed with me and are not going to refund him, although I am still out the return shipping.

I really want to email this guy and send a picture of the packing slip he accidentally sent me, but I'm going to refrain.

Ebay,Thoughts on shipping and lost/stolen package situation,"A little background, I am both a regular buyer and seller on ebay and think I have a pretty good feel for how transactions should go.  
I recently purchased an item from a seller on 11/15 and the listing stated delivery in 4-8 days.  The seller didn't ship the item until the 21st and it was delivered on the 25th.   
The problem is when I purchased the item I expected it to show up on the 22nd at the absolute latest based on the reported shipping/handling time.  Because it was shipped so late it arrived right after thanksgiving on the 25th when I was not at home.  By the time I got home the next day the item was gone.

Ebay,Getting nothing but scam buyers on my expensive listings. Anything I can do?,"Tried selling my Oculus Rift for about 3 months up until giving up a few months ago because it was nothing but scammers buying the item over and over and PayPal went nuts and started withdrawing money from my bank account instead of the PayPal account. 

Apparently they wanted to charge their fees first and so there wasn't enough money to return with PayPal's cut taken out so they went right to the bank account to withdraw the full amount for the refund causing me fees for overdrawing. It's hard to explain it well but it was a horrible experience. Took a lot of time to get them to correct it and I'm still having problems with it even today.  

Now I'm trying to sell a graphics card and it's having the same problems with scammers buying it over and over, and I've only been trying to sell that today.

I have the pay when you Buy It Now option set up, a blacklist and some settings to help keep scammers from buying my stuff but they're still buying it. Anything else I can do?

Ebay,Thoughts on this INR case? Do you guys think its legit or a little fishy?,"Hey r/ebay, I've got my first case opened against me and it's an INR. I decided to post because I think it is a little strange and I need some advice. Basically, I sold an item about 2 weeks ago and over this past weekend the buyer opened an INR case against me. I checked tracking on the order in eBay and felt somewhat relieved because eBay shows it as being delivered, but then I got nervous because the tracking details are a little strange. The USPS tracking info through eBay shows the following updates:

DELIVERED IN/AT MAILBOX
Nov-28-16, 12:57 PM

UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED
Nov-29-16, 09:12 AM

UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED
Nov-28-16, 12:59 PM

ARRIVAL AT UNIT
Nov-27-16, 11:06 AM

They are in that exact order and the eBay tracking page shows that the item has been successfully delivered. So I responded to the case by uploading tracking and commenting that the status shows delivered. Then I immediately called eBay customer support to confirm that I had seller protection and the rep told me that I did and that she could guarantee that I would win this case. She said she made a note  on the case that I called and that she confirmed tracking info. She also asked me to message the buyer separately with tracking info, so I did that. I also asked the buyer to confirm the shipping address provided to ebay and she said that it was correct.

So I was going to leave it at that assuming I would win the case if the item disappeared. But then I checked PayPal and the funds are on hold, which wasn't surprising, however, when I check the tracking status there, the bar is orange and it says that the package was not delivered and is being returned to sender. So the two are not synced and I don't really know where I stand in terms of seller protection.

For some additional background, the address was a pretty basic residential address and I can't think of any reason why it would not have been delivered. The buyer's account is a couple years old, but it only has a few transactions and most of them are from this past month. They did leave positive feedback on another item that was recently purchased, so I assume they are receiving items.

The item itself is about $300 and while I would be okay if I had to eat it, I obviously don't want to. Also, I'm happy to give the refund to the customer, I just want to make sure I get the item back and my FVF refunded if possible. At this point, I don't really know what I should do next - any thoughts? Thanks!",2,4,2016-12-04,EBAY,0.04434706270694733,0.9163385033607483,0.03931441530585289

Some items I am reselling as new. I will inspect the boxes and parts (if possible) but not break seals to preserve their ""new"" condition.

Other items will be sold as used, will have multiple pictures taken of them, and tested thoroughly.

Still others may be unable to be tested and I want to sell as-is. How do I document that correctly?

What should I do? I responded to his e-mail saying that I definitely shipped him the correct item. He's probably going to abuse his buyer protection, I've already reported him.

 If it matters, he has ~100 positive feedback, and I have ~185 positive feedback with no negatives. I've sold plenty of other items for around the same price, and nobody has ever had a problem before.


update: this asshat sent me pictures of some random jacket claiming I sent that to him.

Edit: after searching around I read that a lot of people get scammed, like the guy who sold his PS4. At this point, I'm afraid the scammer is going to win and I'll be down $450, what should I do? Can I just unlink my information from paypal? 



**final update**: I told the guy to check the weight on the packages, turns out the guy had me ship the package to an international shipping service who shipped the package to him overseas.

Ebay,is this considered feedback extortion?,"so, I do admit I made a mistake. you know when you relist a multi listing, even if anything was sold before your listing ended, ebay will put the original numbers of items before the listing ended, as if nothing sold.

so I relisted, and forgot to adjust the number of items available, and the item that I no longer had sold.

Immediately after I messaged the buyer explaining the situation, and I said ""if there is nothing else you would like from my listing, I will need to refund you""

but when I thought about it, if the buyer opens an item not described case etc, I will lose because the item sent will not match the item in the description so I refunded her and explained that I did not want her to keep waiting for the refund.

then her message : ""Did you cancel and refund the order before you gave me a chance to respond?!?! I paid for this with a prepaid gift card and it is going to take a million years for the refund to actually go back on the card!""

I apologized to her and explained that I did not know about the gift card taking a long to get refunded.

her response

""Don't worry I'll be sure to leave a negative review...""


she did not say "" if you do not give me this, I will leave a neg"" but since I have been pretty lucky with the case outcome and feedback removal lately, I wanted to see if you guys think this is removable once she leaves a neg. and if you do think it is removable, how to talk to the rep about it?

Ebay,"Think I've been Scammed, eBay hasn't helped","I won an auction for three hobby-related books. The seller has 100% positive feedback for thousands of feedback comments.

eBay stepped in and closed my case, saying that because the tracking information showed it was delivered I need to ask for a return from the seller. Here's the issue: I don't want to return the item I received. I want either a partial refund or the other two books I paid for. The seller hasn't communicated at all with me and at this point I'm fairly certain he's been lying to string me along so that we're outside the 14 day return policy for the auction.

Ebay,Unwelcome or Malicious buyer/bidder,"Hello all,
A few months back someone purchased an item from me which they said was broken. They committed mail fraud and returned an item with a different serial number. I guess my strongly worded message about contacting law enforcement worked because they let the 30 days lapse and the case went away. I blocked and moved on.

Now, the buyer purchased a new item from me under a different username...same name, address, and a new email that is one letter off. I called ebay right away and they of course ""added the buyer to their watch list"" but suggested I still send the item. No way in hell am I sending this guy another item, so I cancelled citing ""problem with buyers address"" (technically correct because it's the same as a user who I blocked).
I fully expect a neg. Two ebay reps told me they noted these problems on my account but that they cannot ""guarantee the outcome"" when I call to have said feedback removed. I cited the Unwelcome or malicious buyer rule which says you cannot circumvent a block from a seller by using a different account. Both reps said there is no way to cancel the transaction on their end so that feedback cannot be left. Is there anything else I can do to protect myself here?

Literally the next day the tracking number updated to say it has been delivered and even has a signature but when I showed the buyer the evidence, they said it's not true and that signature is not their own.

So I have several conclusions. Either the buyer is lying and decided to keep the console and money or Royal Mail decided to forge a signature and just keep the parcel.

Ebay,huh? where did that $75 gift card balance come from!,"something really weird is going on with my ebay(not paypal) account.

i just bought a $7 item and went to checkout, and to my surprise there was a $75 gift card balance waiting for me. i checked my paypal, my cc, my ebay account - i can't figure out where this $75 came from.  trust me, i'm between jobs right now - so i'm watching every single dollar in and out.  if i got a $75 gift card for myself or from some mystery fan, i would not have forgotten about it.  

this past year i did have a few returns and bogus listing buys - but they were separately credit resolved long ago.  i'm the only person using this account, and even the only one using my screen saver password protected pc.

wtf is going on here?!

Ebay,"Tracking shows ""undeliverable as addressed"" and delivered twice with 3 weeks between deliveries but I never received it","I bought a $400 item on ebay over a month ago and never received it so I opened a non receipt claim.  The seller never uploaded a tracking number, didn't respond to emails, but when the case was opened they added tracking that showed it was delivered on Nov. 1st. 

The problem is I never received anything, and the tracking information they uploaded is really sketchy. In the tracking history it shows ""Undeliverable as Addressed"" on Oct 31st but then it says it was left in my mailbox on Nov. 1st. There was 100% nothing in my box.

Then almost 3 weeks later on Nov. 18th it starts tracking again (How is this possible if it was delivered!!??). It again shows ""Undeliverable as Addressed"" and then it shows delivered in my mailbox again on Nov. 21st. Still nothing in my box.

eBay closed the claim in favor of the seller on Nov. 11th (before it started tracking again) so I opened a paypal claim which they also found in the sellers favor and closed on Nov. 18th.

The seller did not print the label through eBay or Paypal and I asked several times for them to show me a receipt with proof the item was actually sent to the correct address but they never replied.  

Also, I live in an apartment building and I have never had a package left in my mailbox because my mailbox is about 5"" wide (I buy everything online and about 2-3 things on ebay a week). Our mailman delivers all of our complexes packages to the office and then the office adds them in their system which emails me when I have a new package. When you view the tracking information for my delivered packages on USPS.com it always shows ""Delivered, Front Desk/Reception"" and has not once said ""Delivered, In/At Mailbox"" like this package did.

Has anyone ever seen tracking information like this? Could this be a scam where they just sent something to my zip code and not my address?  Should I appeal this case or is there anything I can do?  I would file a chargeback with my credit card but like an idiot I used paypal funds. Thanks so much everyone :)

Ebay,"Bought a laptop with a bad battery, started a dispute, opinions?","I bought a used laptop for $80 + $20 shipping. When it came the battery wouldn't hold a charge, so I message the seller and ask if he'd refund me $15-20 to cover me buying a new battery. He says the battery was fine and he doesn't accept returns.

So, I file a dispute he comes back with an offer of about $5 and neither of us post feedback. Or I pay shipping to return it and IF he deems it is in the condition when I bought it he will refund me $100.

I'm not about to spend $20 to send it back and have him keep my $100. I left him neutral feedback saying its fine except the battery and the seller accusing me of lying. I'd rather leave the truth up than get $5 to keep quiet.

I took a video showing that when its fully charged the battery dies within 5 minutes of booting up. Haven't heard a reply yet.

I've already purchased a replacement battery and need this laptop for my business, I don't want to go through the hassle of returning it and finding another one.

I think I'm being reasonable asking him to reimburse me $15. But it seems like if eBay steps in they will just say return it for a full refund or keep it and drop the complaint. Then I'm out $20 shipping and still have to buy another laptop.

How do these usually turn out? This is my first negative experience with eBay and its frustrating.

EDIT Wow this guy is a dickhead.

Buyer: (me)Hey, I'm a bit disappointed in this laptop. Your description didn't say the battery doesn't hold a charge. It dies after 15 minutes at best. Would you do a partial refund to cover my cost of buying a replacement battery?

Seller: 15 minutes? I did not say anything about the battery, in part, because I had no problems with it - especially anything like you described. I upgraded the memory and the hard drive and loaded the operating system, I'm sure that if the battery was an issue it would have appeared during that period of time. Also, if I know of any problems I state them to make sure that people are aware of what they are buying before they buy from me as I do not make refunds. I stated it was a used laptop, not brand new, and that used condition includes the battery. The only new items were the docking station and the power supply - and I packed those in their original box and sent them to you along with the manuals and keys. If you are not happy with the purchase now after receiving it and have changed your mind, I'm sorry but I do not make refunds as I clearly state in the auction. Thank you. Reply

Buyer: As soon as I turned on the computer for the first time it had a warning that the battery died while windows was running the last time it ran. I charged it until it was full, died in 15 minutes. I charged it over night, again died in 15 minutes. ""Used: An item that has been used previously. The item may have some signs of cosmetic wear, but is fully operational and functions as intended. This item may be a floor model or store return that has been used. See the seller’s listing for full details and description of any imperfections""

""Laptop is in excellent physical condition. Includes brand new Lenovo Power Supply, and ThinkPad Advanced Mini Dock and Port Replicator with DVI video connector. New install of Windows Business Vista.""

""Returns: Seller does not offer returns.""

I'm not asking for a return, I'm asking you to be fair and refund me $15-20 because now I have to buy a battery. The laptop is in great condition, I'm happy with it, I'm happy with your excellent packaging. But, you intentionally did not mention the issue with the battery. The issue that was obviously known to you if it died the last time you used it. Used- ""fully operational and functions as intended"" I disagree with that.

Seller: Please do not take me for a fool. The last time that the laptop was running was when I was checking it out and taking the pictures I put in the auction description. The pictures clearly show the laptop was plugged in (see icon and power cord), the battery gauge shows full and no problems. The laptop was properly shut down and packaged. There is no possible way that the laptop gave you ""a warning that the battery died while windows was running the last time it ran"" because it was plugged into a power source the last time it ran. And I say again, I had no problems with that battery or I would have stated that in the auction (you can check out my auctions for the Apple Powerbook G4 or the Apple MacBook Pro for parts as examples of recent auctions). Lastly your comment of ""you intentionally did not mention the issue with the battery"" has totally ended any further conversation.

Buyer: I filed the eBay dispute at this point

Seller: ""Mr. ..., I spoke with eBay this evening. They said I could get them involved and/or try to work this out with you. While I know what I sent you, I will make one attempt to settle this matter as amicably as possible before I turn it over to them. You say the battery was bad, I dispute that and you provided no evidence to support your claim, while I had the pictures from the listing that show your version to be a bit off. In any event, I did a search for new replacement batteries for the Lenovo ThinkPad T500 on eBay. I found that they start at $11.52 with free shipping from a Top Seller with many units left to sell. That you chose the most or one of the most expensive replacements was your choice. I will offer you 50% of that $11.52 price - $5.76 – and no feedback posted from either of us to settle this matter. Your request to settle for $15-20 is not real and patently unfair, considering you want me to pay more than 1/2 the cost of a new battery that you choose from the upper spectrum of the price offerings at $28; and it works out to be 25% of the purchase price of the laptop and dock itself – this I will not do. If this option is not to your liking then pack the laptop, battery, power supply, manuals, dock and keys up as carefully and completely as I sent it to you and ship it back to me, your expense, and I will refund your initial purchase price and the shipping you initially paid me when and if I receive the laptop and dock in the exact same condition as I sent it to you and no feedback posted from either of us. Please let me know which option to settle you choose and let us be done with this.""

Buyer: My message isn't in my sent folder but I sent this video and that I found no battery at such a price. The cheaper ones are Chinese batteries with negative feedback. I spent $27.50 on a genuine Lenovo battery.  he responds with

Seller: ""You can spin this any way you want. I am done. I had no problems with the computer, including the battery, while it was in my possession. Return the computer. I will refund your purchase price of $80. It appears I will be paying for the return shipment, so I am not paying for the original shipping.""

To reply now, see your request details. If you have not agreed on a solution by Dec 10, 2016 , you can ask us to step in and help. If you and your seller need more time to work things out, your request will stay open until Jan 20, 2017.

Ebay,I want to sell a desktop computer? Have questions?,"So I've sold computer parts before on eBay and am a little experienced on some things- but on others, I just need to ask questions on. I built a decent gaming machine and most the parts in there are considered brand new condition aside from me turning it on, the Windows installation, and setting it up afterwards along with a few hour stress test. 

Anyway, I want to sell it and I've tried a few apps that let sellers sell locally but the prices people want for it are absurd. I was asking for $500 and people are offering me less than half that despite the up to date specs, the fact it has a semi-decent proc in there, an R7 series graphics card, Win 10 Pro, and 16GB of memory. I'm just not getting anywhere with some of the places I tried!

So I'm hoping to turn to eBay but I don't want to get scammed. Was wondering on a few things:

A) how do I get a computer tower packaged if I don't have the original case box? Could I go to UPS and ask them to do it? The last thing I want is the computer to get damages in shipping. 
B) what steps can I take to protect myself against getting scammed? I'm sure someone would try to take advantage of this and get a free computer.
C) any other suggestions aside from eBay? I honestly was trying to avoid eBay at first because i was worried about getting scammed and I don't know the first thing about trying to package a computer tower for shipping, but I've been trying to sell this computer for a few weeks now (before I upgraded it however with extra memory and a dedicated gpu) and I'm just not getting anywhere. I could offer a little lower but the majority of parts inside are considered new and the fact it could handle games released today at decent frame rate along with being able to do other things like say- streaming at the same time- makes me feel like I can justify my price point.",2,3,2016-12-11,EBAY,0.026784086599946022,0.9244950413703918,0.04872092604637146

Ebay,"Slightly concerned about recent sell, just wanted to see if this is a common occurence","I recently started an auction for a jailbroken ps3. I know it's a grey area, but there were dozens for sale on ebay. Not here to discuss that, though. It had custom firmware, a few games, and some emulators installed (with several retro games), as well as the standard peripherals. Set the starting bid at about $190 (that was my bottom dollar) but attached a buy it now price of $350. That's just a little higher than what I consider the item to be valued at

Only 24 hours after I started the 7 day auction, someone purchased it through the buy now option, considerably overpaying when he could have bid on the item and paid much lower, potentially. I've sold a few thousands dollars worth of items, but I've never ran into this or even any bad situation before with ebay which is why I just wanted to double check and verify everything I can before I ship

The payment immediately went through after he won the auction. So I double checked to see if his account was verified. It says the address is confirmed, however, it also says ""The sender of this payment is UNVERIFIED"". I researched and found out that means his bank account isn't confirmed? I'm not sure if that's even a problem, though. 

His ebay page has no activity. This person has been a member since April 2014, which seems like a great thing to me as a seller. He also has only 3 positive reviews, the last one being over a year ago. Not exactly a problem, but it just kind of seemed weird to me since he used the buy it now price instead of participating in the auction

I reached out to the buyer, thanked him for the purchase and asked if he had any questions or requests before I ship it. Not sure if they will respond.  Just wanted to see if this is commonplace or if I should be weary of a scam seeing this has never happened to me before. I'm definitely not going to cancel on a legitimate buyer",14,4,2016-12-12,EBAY,0.06473604589700699,0.8924569487571716,0.04280701279640198

Ebay,I discovered a major flaw in the ebay Bucks program and ebay's response is making me feel as if it may be intentional,"ebay Bucks is limited to $500 per quarter. Once that limit is reached, any qualifying purchase within that quarter will not receive any bucks **even if a refund for an item purchased previously is processed afterwards, resulting in a reduction of the $500 ebay bucks balance.**

This means that ebay will not retroactively issue you the bucks for the purchase that was denied the bucks due to the limit being reached.

Example of ebay Bucks balance

Seven Purchases of $5,000 and two refunds:

1. 12/1 earn $100 - Balance $100
2. 12/1 earn $100 - Balance $200
3. 12/1 earn $100 - Balance $300
4. 12/7 earn $100 - Balance $400
5. 12/7 earn $100 - Balance $500 - limit reached
6. 12/7 earn $0 - Balance $500 - limit reached
7. 12/7 earn $0 - Balance $500 - limit reached
8. 12/10 refund purchase #1, earn ($100) - Balance $400
9. 12/10 refund purchase #2, earn ($100) - Balance $300

In this example, purchases #5 and #6 now qualify for $100 each in ebay Bucks, however the balance of $300 is what remains in place.

So far, I am 5 phone calls in with ebay on this. The first representative just kept repeating what she saw on the screen and refused to help. The second submitted a request for $100 extra in ebay bucks which was denied, the third call the representative tried to deny but submitted a request which I was credited $100 the other day for, I am still owed another $100+, so I called again. Only one representative of all the five I have spoken with understood what was going on, the others didn't seem to understand and was trying to accept what the website was displaying as gospel.

Ebay,How to handle buyer's remorse?,"I'll try to keep it short.

I've sold some video games on eBay recently, 2 of which were won by the same bidder (one of the games is a sequel of the other) and the buyer has paid for the first game, but not the other.

I received a message today from him saying he wasn't sure if he wanted the game because he's never really played that genre before (normally plays FPS games, which these games aren't).

He stopped short of asking to cancel either of the sales but I'm not entirely sure how to proceed - I was thinking of replying to him reminding him of his obligations that if you bid on an item you should be prepared to pay for it, but also to reassure him that the games themselves are excellent even for their genre (okay I'll tell you guys, it's Uncharted).

I have my sales set to 'do not accept returns' if that matters.

Let's say, hypothetically

Case1----- You ship your expensive item *with* tracking and all proper procedures, however the buyer claims he received empty package, or nothing of value, even if he received the package (you cannot prove or disprove if he is lying, while received the item). What can you do if he opens a case, saying the seller is fraud?

Case2: Similarly, What if you are the buyer here and you actually receive a fraud BUT TRACKED pack? Besides recording every item you open how are you protected for this case

Case3 Damaged goods, Let's say somebody buys a product described ""like new"" however you receive a product that is very old, you can take pictures, will you get your money back? Will you have to return the product by mail?

Case4 if you are the seller in this case, they buy a product they have a used copy already, they say that you shipped them a damaged broken item where really they replace your working one with their damaged one while speaking to paypal

Someone in another country (within Europe) bought 5 items of clothing from the ebay shop I manage, and then found they were too big upon receiving them (and is... heavily insistent that our sizing chart is wrong, despite it being the manufacturers chart), they filed the reason for return with ebay as ""doesn't fit."" and have returned the garments, and we've refunded them their initial purchase cost, but now they want us to reimburse them for the costs of returning, at a non-trivial cost (£30 from &lt;country&gt; to the UK), under UK distance selling rules we are not liable for return costs if the item is unwanted (but would be if it were say, faulty, or not as described), but the seller is arguing that our size chart is wrong, which it isn't, I've measured the items myself upon their arrival back here.

I've spoken to ebay on the matter and they said that we've done everything properly and that they consider the matter closed.. but.. how exactly do I tell my buyer this without them throwing a hissy fit, or worse, negative feedback at us?

Ebay,Seller refusing return for a refund,"I bought an iPhone last month that seller described as in working condition. But when I get it, it's locked down with Apple account! I message the seller to remove the Apple account, but he was very accusatory, saying it was my fault, it's not his account, and he can't help me. So I initiated a return.  He never responded, so Ebay ruled in my favor. Ebay provided me a label, dropped it off at the post office, and I went about my life.

One month later, it still has not been delivered.  I contacted the customer support for the post office for assistance, since it was weird that it hadn't been delivered.  They called today to say that it being returned due to the seller refusing the package.

Now, what I'm concerned about is, I don't get a refund unless it has been delivered.  If the seller is refusing the delivery and it is being sent back to me, what is the status of my refund?

Once i pressed the b button the game pressed b about 20 times in a row and then the console froze. I restarted the console and assumed it was just the consoles fault. However, once i turned on the SNES i tried pressing b but it had no affect. I then thought maybe it was my controller and went out to buy a new controller. Same thing. No b button. I since have went out and bought a new snes but it still pisses me off that the fake chinese game broke my system.

Ebay,[META] Some advice please on very small purchase (10$): Buyer worked with me on purchase and went to bat for me. But received DOA item. Details inside.,"Item was about 10 bucks

So I contacted a seller of some antiquated PDA hardware bundles and asked if they would work with me on a purchase. I received everything (except for a leather case pouch) (no big loss there) but a lot of the stuff was broken, missing or had major cosmetic damage. The PDA itself arrived DOA. 

I troubleshooted it to exhaustion. No dice :(

Should i ask the seller for a refund ? It is likely they may have taken a loss on the shipping.

There was only 2 items out of about 7 that i know are actually usable at the moment. 

3 of the other accessories look ok but i have no way to test them without a working unit.

One modem accessory was actually so corroded on the inside battery compartment (likely from moisture) that i nearly got sick.

I sent paypal a message asking if i could request a partial 7$ refund. I think that is fair given the entire situation.

Ebay,"Buyer claims item is not as described, but I smell a scam","So, I recently sold a copy of a video game on Ebay. The game itself was used, but only had been played once and then it sat in its case on a shelf. I take care of all of my CDs, and I tested this item before I packaged and shipped it. It worked perfectly, and the back of the CD was in great condition. (I did, however, fail to take any pictures of the CD itself because I didn't foresee an issue like this coming up. Rookie move, I know.) I also included a ""no returns"" policy, which I now realize is not the same as ""no refunds"".

However, the buyer is claiming that the item was not as described because it is supposedly scratched up and unplayable. The only way this item could have become damaged was during shipping, but I don't see how. It was shipped inside of it's original case with the (rather hefty) game manual inside of a bubble wrap envelope. I have personally bought many used games that arrived in the same way that I shipped this game and they did not arrive with any damage.

The buyer admitted during his disputes with me that he did purchase my game to replace a copy of his own that was damaged and scratched. I'm honestly thinking that he's trying to ""swap"" the damaged item for a working copy and stick me with the loss because he is insisting (rather stiffly and rudely) on a full refund. I am already aware the Ebay tends to side with the buyer than the seller...

Even if I work this out with the buyer in private (if he is willing to send back the game he claims is damaged, despite the policy listed), how can I prove if he sends back my original game or his damaged one?

Is there anything here that could possibly work in my favor? Or am I completely screwed into giving this guy the CD and the money?

Ebay,International Selling Question,"I get a lot of questions from bidders asking the cost of shipping to places outside of Canada. I'm unsure why this happens because I always enter the dimensions and weight in the listing when I'm setting the listing up. I also select the option that shipping will be whatever the actual cost of shipping is. and lastly I select the option to allow international shipping and choose an option there.

It seems strange then that eBay does not calculate the cost of shipping automatically for the bidders. Unfortunately this cost me a sale yesterday, because the bidder did not know the cost of shipping when they were bidding (although it apparently said ""please contact the seller"").

Does anyone know if I'm doing something wrong, or is this just how eBay works?

Ebay,Caught a scammer. Wooot!!,"So I sell some digital coupons.  He acts innocent like he doesn't know how it works. I go back and forth with him, send him a screenshot, walk him through, like a damn customer service rep.

Buys 2.  then another 2.  THen says he didn't get part o what was promised, and that he had to cancel the order, yada yada.  

But I smell something fishy, as I tested the codes myself.  Then the 3rd code mysteriously doesn't work, but I can tell it got used.  

So now he asks for 3 more codes since the ""didn't"" work, and out of his generosity, he'll give me $10 more. I say something like, but why would you cancel the order.  You even told me you had a screenshot, and one of the reps said it would be fine.  YOU HAD PROOF.  He says the company inactived, blah blah blah. ""you know, if I go to ebay they will just refund it all.

I say something like, so after all I've done, you're not going to extort me for 3 more codes, and threaten me with going to ebay for a refund if I don't give those codes to you? You know what, I'm going to stand up for myself and everyone in the community because what you're doing is wrong.  I went out of my way to help you, took a screenshot, walked you through, and this is what you're going to do?  Now, you are either scamming me, or if those codes didn't work, you now want me to be out the money I paid on those codes, then you get your huge discount on the item, and I have to be out even more money on more codes?  Am I getting this right??

I ask questions, catch him in some lies, and his story just isn't logical.  I ask him for a screenshot of the email. He then says, he's tired of this and just do a refund on all four.  

I tell him..go ahead and give me negative feedback, to file a claim to ebay or whomever,  and that I want ebay to see our conversation and what you're doing.  

He says he's trying to help me and he can get these from someone else..just a bunch of mumbo jumbo.

I contact other sellers, and give only the first and last letter of his username.  One immediately responds and tells me the exact same scenario happened. We then confirmed the name.

So I reply to scammer, and tell him AHA, so you have run this scam with others which I""ve now confirmed.  Go ahead, and file that claim.  I can't wait.  And ebay will be looking at our conversation/transaction, and the transaction of the other scam you pulled, and possibly other refund transactions you've done.  I'll be waiting!!!

Now he wants to deal with me and is offering $20 for 2 coupons.  Why would you offer to pay for more, if you legitimately had bad codes.

He's still emailing me, and after all I've said to him about being a scammer, you'd think he'd give up

Ebay,"Offered full refund/return, settled on partial...buyer is angry again?","Hi all, this is throwing me for a loop.


So- I sold an item I received as a gift. The gift really wasn't something I wanted, I really hadn't looked at it since receiving it so went ahead and listed it as new. I sent it, and it turns out that it wasn't new and in fact had a scratch on it. Crap.

Buyer opens a return request (without messaging me first but ok, that's cool you're not happy). Includes pictures, etc. It ultimately doesn't surprise me judging by the friends who gave me the gift. I'm embarrassed, immediately accept the return and send him a message to apologize/explain that I meant no harm.

He says a refund of half the cost would be fine and he would keep it, which I turned down. He then says he will send the item back for full refund, cool, I even uploaded a shipping label for him. Then he says a $25 refund would be sufficient, he will leave good feedback, happy holidays etc.

I literally replied ""Are you sure? I will send payment right away."" because it was a generous thing for him to do given how unhappy he was. He confirms.

I then had to ask him to cancel the return request so PayPal would allow me to send a partial refund. He does this. I send his partial refund. 

The next day, out of nowhere, he shoots me a message, ""I will be mailing this back to you on Monday via USPS."" I told him I don't understand? 

He now says he thinks he's been ripped off...the scratch is too big. He thinks I've lied about where I got it. He's been trying to resell (for what, 12 hours? on a specialty item) and hasn't been successful. He's not happy.

His own listing for the item says that he tried it out, it works well but that he wants an electric model instead of manual one which is why he is selling. It sounds more to me that he just ultimately didn't like it after purchasing.

What should I do? Whose side will Ebay take (he has a long history on Ebay). I'm really annoyed that I'm going in circles with this guy. Can he even open another return request with Ebay? How would you handle it?",6,3,2016-12-18,EBAY,0.05005630850791931,0.9060285091400146,0.043915245682001114

Ebay,Ripped off and Ebay ripped me off some more,"I sold a radio on ebay a few weeks ago.  I try to protect myself so I took pictures of the radio with it on and in working condition before I sold it.  It sold for $220 dollar.  Ebay charged me $22 in fees.  I received 213.32 on paypal because of fees.  I shipped the radio which cost me 11.35.  A week after the buyer got the radio he emailed me and said it didn't work.  I figured he didn't know how to use it or something.  I gave the buyer a refund.  I had to pay another 10.50 to ship it back.

When I got the radio back it was not the same as I shipped it.  The buyer cut the power cord.  He removed the knobs off the front of the radio.  What I found out he did was he removed the insides of the radio and replaced them with a broken radio.  I immediately called ebay and told them.  Ebay said there was nothing they could do about it.  I told them I had photos proving it and they still said they have no way of fixing it.  The said I would have to contact the police.  They issued the guy a refund for $220.  The took $220 out of my paypal account(even though I was only paid $213.32).  Ebay also still says I owe $220 dollars.  I have called twice but they can't seem to fix it.  Just so anyone reading to this point....I am furious.  So, guess what happened next.

I called ebay again to fix this stuff.  I also asked for a final value credit.  They said that since an refund was issued they won't give back the final value credit.  So, ebay is charging me 22 dollars on money I don't even have for stolen items.  I got completely ripped off.  Ebay helped me get ripped off.  Then Ebay ripped me off.  In total I am out $51.13 plus my stolen radio.  Ebay doesn't even care. Pretty heartless people there.  Someone gets ripped off and you still charge them fees.  I spend most of the calls with ebay while working a double at the fire station trying to make money for Christmas.  But, ebay doesn't care.  So, I am closing my ebay account after 18 years.  Makes me pretty sad that people in this world treat others so poorly.  That big companies like ebay rip customers off and you can't do anything about it.  Or, how some normal guy firefighter like me just trying to make some money for Christmas can get ripped off so badly and ebay helps the criminal profit.  Merry Christmas except in my house this year.  Some jerk and ebay took my kids Christmas money.

Ebay,First time seller with people trying to scam me,"I use ebay every now and then for purchases, but i have a 2010 macbook im trying to sell and had several offers, one that was ~$50 more than what i was asking.

Obviously i didnt, and shortly got an actual ebay email saying it was a 'suspicious buyer' and they are mo longer a registered user. 

So i put my item back on ebay to sell and got one offer for over $100 more than what im asking and another offer for the asking price. Both accounts are less than a day old. I declined the large offer. So i went back and looked at the accounts of the previous offers I received from my original listing and they were all ~1 day old. 2 of them are 'not registered users anymore '

Ebay,Please help me. I was screwed over by EBay and this Reddit is the last thing I can turn to.,"Hello, and thanks in advance. Around November of 2016 I was able to save up almost enough money to buy a new laptop. I decided to put up my old ASUS ROG onto eBay to cover the difference which quickly was bidded up to $560. I claimed I wouldn't include the hard drive, but it was in working condition and it sold pretty fast.

Around a week after it was sold it was requested to be returned and claimed it was broken. My heart sunk into my chest as I hope it was a practical joke. The guy I sold it to basically said that it got to him broken. It wouldn't turn on and the disk tray was making an odd sound. He claimed it was given to him broken and that he had evidence and the unboxing video. I constantly asked for both, but he would not give me either of it. I spent days talking to both him and the eBay customer support. Both were not very helpful. I offered a partial refund and was denied. When I talked to the customer support they told me it would be given in my favor as I actually attempted to make negotiations whilst he wanted a full refund. I told the person I cannot give a partial refund for something that was not in the same condition that I sent it in. Eventually it was rewarded in his favor despite me being told differently. 

I now have the computer and it was obvious that it was dropped on its side. The disk tray won't open even. I wrapped it perfectly so it wasn't damaged in shipping, even if it was I already made a claim. 

I have spent days on my phone trying to get a deal from the eBay customer support. I even mentioned their [3rd step of case resolution management](http://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/seller-protection/index.html) they literally cannot provide me with an answer as to why they cannot follow this agreement.

My questions are: 1. Is the seller allowed to hit me up for additional money when he did not ensure that shipping costs on his end? 2. Would eBay advise him to invoice me for money? 3. Am I responsible to give the seller more money for his mistake?

Edit: Called eBay about the seller, they said he has no right to do that and what the final cost is on eBay is what he is owed. His mistake, his loss.",11,9,2016-12-21,EBAY,0.1255752593278885,0.8402694463729858,0.03415537625551224
Ebay,"Messed up bad (eBay Seller), need advice, please help!","First I just want to say that I am aware that I screwed up and made some stupid mistakes that could have been avoided, so I really don't want/need to here any ""you shouldn't have done that"" or ""could have done that"" type stuff, it isn't going to help me solve this urgent problem I've gotten myself into. If you don't have positive advice then please just don't even post, I have been dealing with some serious personal problems and health/mental issues and am at a very low point in my life; it has greatly effected my business performance. I should probably also add that I have been in business for around 5-6 years but I am a smaller home-run business with no employees. Conversely, if anyone would like to contribute some positive advice for me in the future then I would gladly welcome it, but that isn't really the info/advice I am currently and desperately needing ATM.

I've really screwed up this Christmas, I have probably at least 50 complaints/inquiries right now and almost every single one of my order's have been late (many still not shipped), some up to 2-3 weeks delayed, and of course, now is obviously the worst possible time of the year for this to happen. I may actually lose money this Christmas this year as I am trying very hard to save my business' reputation to the point of giving some customer's their order completely free (by refunding them after they have been shipped late), some with expedited shipping, all paid by myself.

I make my products and haven't been able to stay caught up, but that isn't public knowledge to my customers, I try retain the image as a re-seller to my customers for most of my products and prefer it that way for my own reasons. Also, I sell embroidered patches as well as digital downloadable embroidery designs, however the patches are my main problem/concern.

**Main Question:
Is anyone willing to give me some advice and maybe help me out with creating a good custom template for apologies about the delay/lack of communication and not keeping my customers updated on their order status?**

I have some really pissed off customers (both on Etsy and eBay). I've usually been pretty good at turning around even the hardest to please/(understandably)upset customers because of long delays, but, I currently have such a large amount of messages and so much work that I do not have the time to type an explanation/apology personalized to every single one of my customers that have messaged me, so I really need a general 'copy and paste' template to inform my customers about their order's customized for my business and the mistakes I've made.**At this point I am mainly trying to avoid getting anymore bad feedback while avoiding as many refunds as I can. I've gone from %99 to %97 on eBay this year, dropped %1 just this month alone.**

Please if anyone is experienced with dealing with this type of situation I would be so grateful for your advice, I am really hoping to find a professional apology template that says that I take full responsibility for the poor service they have received and that I truly hope to make it up to them. One option for trying to make it up to my customers that I do sometimes (and works pretty well for most customers and usually saves me from bad feedback) is to offer shipping an extra patch free of charge so they either end up getting double what they paid for or get an extra different patch for free. This actually saves me money but probably won't work for a lot of my current orders since they need it delivered in time for Christmas and I'm not going to be able to do it for many orders, so I will probably have to just cancel a lot of my most recent orders. If anyone has any alternative ways that I could possibly turn my upset customers around and leave them satisfied then I'd love to hear any ideas.

I am desperately in need of help and I really appreciate any advice offered.

Ebay,Sold $400 in cash for $500 (see details). Need help protecting myself before shipment!,"I’m a long-time eBayer (mostly buyer, occasional seller). 

I listed 20 x uncirculated $20 Dollar Bills (Series 2013) with consecutive serial numbers ($400 face value). If you regularly withdraw cash from your bank, or even an ATM, it's relatively common to receive uncirculated consecutive bills. Among numismatists and currency collectors, there’s a market for these, above that of the face value. Knowing this, I decided to list them. 

It sold for $500 to a buyer with a feedback score in the 200’s, which isn’t ideal but I’m comfortable with. 

The original listing states I’m sending via USPS priority w/signature confirmation and insurance (essentially registered mail), all of which I’m planning. Additionally, I listed the item as non-returnable, given that it’s cash!

That said, eBay’s buyer protection trumps all of that. The buyer could claim he/she received a wad of Monopoly money and make an “item not as described” claim, where I’d ultimately be out $400 dollars + all other applicable costs/fees. 

My question is - what steps can I take to protect myself from this potential fraud/scam from occurring? 

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)

Ebay,"EBAY BUYERS : BEWARE ""FREE GIFT"" SCAMS!","So I am a seller on eBay, I have well over 3k in feedback and feel like I know a thing or two. As a seller I sometimes need to purchase items for my products to make them more attractive on eBay.

So I buy a charger for a laptop I recently got in. I find a cheap on in Japan, seller looks responsible, and honestly I love supporting other sellers on eBay whenever possible. So I buy it. 

24 hours later I get a message on eBay from this seller. The seller states they will be ""Sending two packages, one with my order, the other with my ""Free Gift""."" Ok.... if you say so.

December 22nd rolls around and I get a envelope. It has a piece of plastic inside - yes plastic, and a note: ""Here is your free gift"". Wow. Thanks?

I check my eBay to find out where the other package is - the one with my actual order. Guess what? The seller only uploaded one tracking number - and it is for my piece of plastic / free gift. Which is now showing as a DELIVERED order. So technically I cannot even say the seller never mailed my order!

This is such a scam. And it STINKS. I had the mind to open a immediate return request under wrong item sent, and messaged the seller telling them I am well aware of what they are attempting to do. No response.

So I call eBay and ask to make a report. I can see from the feedback this is not the first or second time, rather the 30th. 

How on earth is this person just getting away with this I ask myself?

Simple - no one is reporting this scam to eBay. 

You MUST call eBay and submit a actual verbal report against the seller. If you do not - no action will be taken. 

I feel bad for the other people who let the order show ""delivered"" for over 30 days - waiting for this ""second package"" to be delivered. Once it gets to 30 days - even if they realize the order is not actually coming - eBay can no longer do anything!

Moral of this story : If someone is sending a ""Free Gift"" they MUST mail in in the same package as your order. If they say they are sending two packages - IMMEDIATELY report this and reply to the seller demanding they send only your order. Otherwise you will end up waiting a month, losing your money, and fighting with the seller via PayPal /Charge-back for months. 


edit: Like I said I sell on eBay, I have indeed included ""free gifts"" for my buyers sometimes. However I ALWAYS put this gift in the same package as the order. Why would I PAY for additional shipping? Makes no sense. If you have a seller telling you they are sending a ""Free Gift"" in a separate package - you can almost guarantee they are intending on ripping you off. 

Are you a victim? If so - request a return/refund as soon as possible. DO NOT WAIT for this other package to arrive. If your past the 30 day maker, you should open a charge back. Opening a PayPal dispute may result in you paying return shipping, just don't go there. Open a charge back and let the credit card company charge the scammer a additional $20 fee for the charge back. Only open one dispute at a time. If the eBay dispute fails for any reason - then pursue the charge back. Don't let these people scam you - good sellers hate this crap too. The only way to stop these scammers is reporting them verbally to eBay - and getting your money back. 

Add on - feedback for this seller : http://imgur.com/a/Bj6Xs

Highlighted feedback = possible victims of this scam. They are stating non delivery of purchase, seller never shipped, etc. Things which may align with this scam.

Bolded feedback = scam victims clearly commenting about how they got a ""free gift"" and no item, or they are directly calling out the scammer for this scam in particular.

Ebay,Help! Buyer trying to scam me,"Hey everyone,

I sold my old iPhone 6S plus recently on eBay. The buyer made me an offer, saying ""this is all I can pay I don't have a job"" blah blah blah. 5 days after they received it, they opened a case against me, saying the home button and speakers don't work.

Ebay,"Sold high value desirable items, received suspicious return claims on them. Buyer of the items escalates to claims after I approved the return and sent labels. Is this a new iteration of the return scam?","I sold some of the newest and best computer video cards on the market recently via a multiple quantity BIN auction. I specified in my buyer requirements limiting buyers to only purchase 1 item to avoid the trolls that will click buy it now for all of them and not pay.

A buyer bought two of the cards, one on what looks to be his primary account and another on what appears to be a sister or mother's account. The addresses are from the same area, same last name, and the name on both Paypal payments were his.

Anyways, the cards were tested and are very exclusive so there are no clones on the market and there's no way to fake them. As soon as he got the cards, he filed return requests on both of them through both of the different ebay accounts with the same reason - claiming that he took the cards apart and that I sent a different model card which is much older and less valuable. I accepted the returns and sent shipping labels.

Four days later, there still wasn't any activity on the tracking numbers for the return labels I sent. I logged into ebay to see that both of the return requests had been closed and were escalated to cases as well as a message from the buyer saying that he was not provided a return shipping label and that he needs them so he can send the cards back. The cases that were opened were also immediately put on hold according to ebay.

The annotation on each of the sold listings says ""Buyer contacted customer service. Awaiting response"". Here's an excerpt from a screenshot showing this - http://i.imgur.com/j9fekoZ.png. Along with the notification message from ebay that the returns had been escalated to cases, I got an e-mail from highvalueclaimsinfo@ebay.com for each auction saying that I need to issue the buyer return shipping labels and to reply to the e-mail with proof that return labels were sent. It says that if there is no proof that I sent return postage by 12/26, that ebay would refund the buyer in full without requiring the item to be sent back! Here's a screenshot of the e-mail with information edited out - http://i.imgur.com/v0RXqRg.png.

This morning, I got a generic e-mail from no.reply@ebay.com with a generic ""Thank you for contacting us, we will get back to you soon"" message. No confirmation that the shipping labels for the cases were received.

At this point, I am already realizing that I've been scammed and will have lost close to a couple thousand dollars on these cards.

The guy is in the U.K. and can't bid on the item because eBay is preventing it due to ""import restrictions""(his words).  Is this possible?

Our communication went like this: 
In the first message I received, he mentioned he wanted the item shipped to Florida although he's from the UK due to these restrictions.  I responded by telling him that I only ship to confirmed addresses and via GSP for international orders.  
In response he messaged me saying that by going through ebay, he wasn't able to bid on the item so he would offer me a pretty nice BIN for the item via paypal.

recently I made a purchase on ebay for which I want your advice. 
I bought a used UK Nintendo 3DS (since it's not available in my country).

Once I turned it on I saw that the top screen was dimmed/darkened and displaying negative colors.

The seller described the nintendo as

Nowhere in the description says that it's faulty.

Ebay,"Nightmare Buyer opens 3 rez cases, returns counterfeit of $500 item. ebay refunds scammer, deletes evidence","This is to serve as a warning for the worst case scenario of what can happen on ebay.  I started an online business while in college selling high-value designer goods.  I was the victim on an online return fraud in which ebay refused to assist me after the individual returned me a counterfeit item via USPS mail.

I sold an individual a vintage, handmade designer belt for $500.  He opened up a resolution center case, claiming that he did not receive the item.  I immediately knew that something was horribly wrong, because when I checked the USPS tracking it had arrived that morning, about one hour before he opens up his case.  After about a week of calling ebay every day, Ebay ended up siding with me after I uploaded the tracking number which provided proof the item was received.

He then opened up a different dispute through the ebay resolution center, (item not as described) claiming that it was a counterfeit belt, which forced me to accept a return.  I attempted to contact the ebay customer support and explain to them what was wrong.  They told me that the case would automatically side with him, because it was an item not as described case.  When this happened, I was forced to accept the return and pay the cost of his shipping label.  The buyer waited until the LAST possible day on the ebay return window to mail the belt.  When I received his return, he had sent me a counterfeit replica of the belt I had sold him.  The item he returned to me was clearly a completely different size and color than I originally sent.  MOREOVER, on his purchase history, I noticed that he had bought this counterfeit belt from another seller right after he won the auction with me.  When I pointed this out in one of the dozens of calls, the customer service rep said ""theres no way to prove the listing was counterfeit.""

After providing these images of the different belt he sent, ebay sided with me and closed the case.  I thought it was finally over, about 4 weeks after he opened the first case against me.

Because of the ebay/paypal split, the two companies are very disorganized.  The scammer took advantage of this fact by then opened up a dispute on paypal.  I tried to explain the situation - how ebay had already agreed that he had been trying to scam me.  They said there was no way for them to see this, and then they sided with him.  I called paypel a dozen times and provided pictures of the disparity between the product I sent vs. his return, and they still refunded him the money from my account.  I was literally crying on the phone trying to understand how they could be so idiotic.  The customer service representative then told me that the only way I could go further would be to file a police report.  I made her wait and listen as I called using another phone.  First I contacted his local police station, who told me I should contact my own station (even though when I told them his address, they recognized it as being a part of their jurisdiction, ""oh yeah, he's one of ours"").   When I contacted my local city, i filled out a police report via the phone, while the paypal customer service agent was listening.  When this was finished, she put me on hold for about 30 minutes, saying she had to speak with a superior.

SHOCKINGLY, they told me that this was NOT enough to give me the $500 back that had been frozen in my account for almost 6 weeks now.  They said that I would have to send them a physically documented police report signed by an officer if they were to refund me.  I pushed the customer service representative further, to find out if there was some other step necessary. The last option was to file an IC3 internet complaint with the FBI.  I did this while still on the phone, and submitted the document to paypal.  FINALLY, the supervisor told me that they had already refunded the scamming buyer in full.  They would be giving me my money back out of pocket.  It's so incredible how they would refuse to listen in this situation, and allowed a criminal to succeed in a scam.

The final blow is that ebay deleted all of the negative feedback on this buyer.  There were about 6-10 other sellers who had gone through the exact same situation, posting feedback explaining that the buyer had abused the return system.  Ebay removed these all as ""violating their feedback policy"" or whatever.  They also deleted all record of the case within the resolution center, far before the normal 90 days after a closed case, at which point i believe it is normal for that to happen.

Moreover, the buyer has changed their ebay username, and still is going about pulling this type of scam.  I reported them for all of these violations:
Buyer misused returns - Did not follow other terms of your return policy
Buyer made unreasonable demands - Demanded a partial refund or discount
Buyer abused a buyer protection program -
Misused the program to claim an item was not received
Buyer abused a buyer protection program -
Misused the program to claim an item was not as described

Ebay apparently does not consider this as grounds for termination of an account.

Here are the messages that the buyer sent me through the resolution center.  I mentioned the abusive nature of the content to the customer service team multiple times, who just ignored it:
""I haven't received my package Thanks”

""I don't know what it can be done at this point Very unfortunate that has happened”

""Hi, I've finally got your Hermes belt. My daughter is not authentic and she doesn't want and I can't even sell due to not me authentic and not having the packaging materials plus is over priced. I just acquire a brand new in the box 90/38mm orange brown Hermes strap for $280 a 38mm buckle for $79 all is a original box. Makes your your belt set way too expensive I'd like to return and good luck selling. Thanks""

""The belt is brand new and has a receipt and all packing material I think was a mistake buy your belt I'd like to return Thanks”

""Look we know when a Hermes is not authentic In this case yours is not just took at the buckle you can tell Even if I want to seel I can not do. It doesn't have packing material Price is too high. Thanks”

""It s clear to me that item is overpriced and not genuine I disagree terrible with the eBay outcome and I refuse to keep this item. Thanks”

""No nothing personal I'm just going in what my daughter told me If I ought to seel this belt I barely going to get $. 300.00 for it because looks Used and don't have the packaging materials. In the other hand we could split the loos in half and call it the day. Let me know what you think. Regards”

""Im not saying you're scamming me just that I don't think is far for me to expect one thing and getting another Once again your bel for $500.00 is too much for me I can't work it out with you 50/50 That's the best fairly I can do Thanks”

""Again I'm just going in what my daughter told me If I ought to seel this belt I barely going to get $. 300.00 for it because looks Used and don't have the packaging materials. In the other hand we could split the loos in half and call it the day. Let me know what you think. Regards “

""Sir, I haven't misuse anything nor anyone either any policy as I passively exercising my rights as a good stand buyer. I have given you two choices and seems like it must be your way or the highway. Well I'm a very good Tauros myself I have pride and quite love a challenge and off course a real hardheaded lol.... No shame nor regrets. Once again split the loos in half $250.00 I'll keep the belt hoping my daughter will wear or I'll return to you, its entirety your choice. If your belt is indeed so valuable I'm sure you will have no problem in a fast selling on eBay, as for me I don't sell anything that I have doubts just principles. I acquired a gorgeous new Hermes from a poor soul on eBay an R stamp Contance very shiny 24mm rose buckle with receipts, box and even a original store bag I'd say cheaper than your belt. How about that huh ? Well that's what eBay is for, if you're on on the right time click the right click YES you get great bargains. That examples what I'm troubled with, when I choose your item I thought I was getting a amazing deal a good investment until I got the belt in the mail finally. I wish I haven't gotten in the mail and that got lost wold save us both a headache. Bottom line is, STOP calling me whatever you're been calling me and you keep your RIGHT and I'll keep mine. End of the story Now just make up your mind because mine is already made up. Just for the record my credit card company will endorse what I've said despite PayPal/eBay decision. Good luck !”

(ps I did not call him names.  I pointed out that he was ""scamming"" me, and that I had reported his account to ebay)

I have already received my money back after 2 months of hard work, stress, and anxiety, but I am posting this as karmic justice against ebay and paypal for letting this happen.  If this story will serve as a warning to those of you who are new sellers online, PLEASE be aware that there are sick people out there who will go to far, far lengths to steal from you online.  Moreover, be warned that ebay and paypal have absolutely no regard for protecting their sellers.  In my time, I negotiated over 100 ebay resolution center cases, and a couple hundred returns via paypal.  This experience was by far the worst nightmare I have ever had in online sales.  I lost multiple nights of sleep to anxiety over the 500 dollars (a large sum of money as a young individual).  I cried multiple times throughout this ordeal.  Please take the following precautions
1. If someone does ANYTHING to give you suspicion, they are a fraud.  If they give you a sob story about their dying kid or how they are broke, don't believe it.  It is far better to be safe than sorry
2. Document your resolution center cases outside of ebay
**3. Do NOT, DO NOT ever say anything negative when a buyer is trying to defraud you.  They will win the case because you let your mouth slip and insulted them.  Keep a cool head in all your communications.
**4. KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS AND TRACKING NUMBERS IN MULTIPLE PLACES
5. Don't sell on ebay or paypal in the first place if you are not ready to deal with scammers. It WILL happen, many many times over.  Around 10% of my transactions turned into credit card fraud, return fraud, or generic garbage
6. Calling paypal and ebay will get you no where.
**7. if you are scammed, immediately file an IC3 complaint form.  File complaints with your local and san jose, CA Better business bureau against ebay and paypal.  File a complaint with the Consumer financial protection bureau against these companies.  File a case with your state attorney generals office.
8. Do not tell ebay or paypal ""im gonna sue you,"" this will get you no where.  They are more lawyer'd up than you are.  I have to count the attorneys in my family on two hands.  By saying this, you are ensuring that they will cease contact with you, and tell you ""okay then no more customer service, you can contact our legal department with further issues""
9. Don't say you weren't warned.",26,20,2016-12-27,EBAY,0.11023044462005298,0.8611624240875244,0.028607120737433434

I don't want to spend too much time on this, it's quite frustrating'

The item was new in the box, but he's provided pics showing sellotape being worn at the top of the box. The item is almost 20 years old, but the box looked in excellent condition to me, so I didn't mention any signs of wear to the box in the listing, stated ""New in box"" and included pics from several angles of the packaging. 

I know eBay is notorious for favouring the buyer, so worry if it goes to an eBay case, i'll end up having to pay a full refund rather than the 50-60% they're asking for, but i'm unhappy to offer anything other than a small gesture (ie 5-10%) for the slight wear to the sellotape seal on the box, as I feel I haven't been at all misleading and the item is new and unopened from original packaging.

First, they took down a listing and banned me from posting for 7 days. I called and told them that I even had a picture of the receipt in the listing pictures. They said that I had a pretty good case and they probably just took it down by accident. Now, I just got the ban removed after 7 days and posted 2 listings , and guess what? Both were revoked in a hour. I don't sell fake shoes. I know the flaws in the fake shoes. I don't sell fake shoes and I've provided all the proof I can to show that the shoes are indeed real.

Ebay,Just Another Crazy Buyer Story,"Just finished a several long week ordeal with a crazy buyer. The first odd bit was that we're located in the US and she's in Australia. We only ship FedEx or UPS internationally which is quite expensive. ~$65 per shipment. She was buying lots of little items and then paying for them before we could send a combined invoice.... Only to complain later about the shipping. Since we hadn't shipped everything, we were able to combine some things and refunded her the difference which is generally against our policy. We also allowed her over a week to pay for outstanding items which is also generally against our policy, but since she was buying a lot and was international, we cut her some slack.

One of the items was a flatware set for $2,000. It arrived in her country towards the beginning of December and despite 3 attempts, the carrier could not complete delivery because she apparently wasn't home. After 3 attempts, they require that the buyer contact them to arrange delivery or pick it up. We were informed of this and sent no less than 4 messages of the course of the next week and a half asking her to pick it up lest it be declared abandoned. UPS calls us to inform us about the issues they're having and says that she told UPS that we, the sellers, are responsible for the customs fees. She messages us saying she's upset it wasn't shipped in 2 packages at half the cost each (presumably to avoid customs?) and now she can't afford it.

Meanwhile, she's still buying other items from us (yet as a reminder, she can't afford to pay the customs!). One of them had an error in the listing so we ended it, but as often happens on websites, the page hadn't finished loading and instead of cancelling the bids, it sold a several hundred dollar item to her for $0.99. We immediately messaged her telling her of the error and asking her not to pay, but she did. We cancelled the transaction and she lost her shit over it, sending a half dozen messages in a matter of minutes about how we're horrible people and she deserves to get a good deal and her brother is some guy we've never heard of that lives in California and she's going to forgive us for now because of the power of Christ.

Moving on, we're not interested in letting her win all our auctions if we're going to ship things for them to get declared abandoned in customs which leaves us liable for the cost according to PayPal. So we put her on our blocked list. She tries to buy more things only to find out she can't, which causes her to flip out again. We explain that we can't let her bid until all outstanding business is resolved.

Suddenly she acknowledges that the package is waiting for delivery and picks it up.

Then she tries to buy more items. But she's still blocked and we tell her that we're not unblocking her till *all* outstanding business is resolved, including the other items that have been awaiting payment for over 2 weeks now. Within 3 minutes we receive [another 10 messages](http://imgur.com/kdcea9n) telling us we're horrible liars, that she's going to report us to eBay (not sure for what), that we have caused her ""a turmoil in health,"" and says she will never ask us for anything ever again... right before she asks to cancel all outstanding transactions.

Not responding. She can enjoy several unpaid item strikes. And she can leave all the negative feedback she wants. I've already spoken with eBay and they've been following the conversation and have already said that because she has made unreasonable demands and tried to get us to help her avoid customs, that they'll remove it.

So as soon as the UPI cases close, I'll be 100% done with her. But at least y'all get a good story out of it and she'll have so many UPI strikes that she won't be bidding on much of anyone else's listings for a good long while.",7,13,2016-12-28,EBAY,0.07525700330734253,0.8909915685653687,0.033751480281353

Ebay,Item Not Received claim opened by buyer was closed today after speaking with a rep - story and some helpful info inside for those ever in this situation,"I sold a Wii U bundle a week before christmas. I have shipped a couple hundred packages and have received a couple hundred more and never had one get lost *knock on wood*. I was relieved when I saw this bundle was delivered two days before christmas especially because I figured it was a gift. Well the buyer opened a claim saying it was never actually delivered. After many messages back and forth with me trying to offer as much factual and experince-oriented advice that I could, the buyer kept learning toward a refund solution. As much as I feel bad that they are going to be out a couple hundred dollars, business is business and I feel no obligation to refund them for a package that was scanned as delivered.

I decided to call ebay again (made an unsuccessful call on Monday that the rep said I had to wait until X date to close the case) and this time talked to a rep that forwarded me to the team that handles case escalation. The lady quickly closed the case (well it still says open on eBay but I am sure it takes a day or so to update). 

I wanted to take this opportunity to clear up a few things from the seller's perspective. One thing was the appeal process - in which she said even if the buyer appeals, it still doesn't affect the seller and the appeal will be dealt with by eBay themselves as they decide to refund the buyer out of their own pocket.

Also, the buyer will not be able to open another case (unless through paypal I guess) in a further attempt to recover their money.

This may all be redundant info to most of you, but this is the second time I have ran into this situation and could not find answers to all of my questions on the internet.

In the end I do feel bad, if it isn't a scammer, and empathize for the buyer if their package was stolen off of their doorstep. There just really is nothing more I can do. I am sure they will continue to message me but I will just direct them to eBay customer support. If I had the money, I would buy them a brand new Wii U and deliver it to their doorstep myself but when it comes down to it when a package is stolen I dont think the seller should be the one to pay the penalty.

I just wanted to share this story since I have seen many similar situations and hope that this story helps someone else resolve their situation. I also recommend signature tracking as I will be doing from now on since all this trounle isn't worth the $2 in savings and could mitigate the risk of this happening.

Ebay,Can a Buyer Re-open A case after it is settled? What about Paypal?,"hello r/ebay.
I sold a lamp for $75 and the buyer failed to look carefully at the full description and pics where there was some minor rust spots. So he wanted a refund. Fine. I asked for the item back. ( I really didn't because shipping costs $40 each way) .  So we reached a compromise... I refunded him $40. He gets to keep it. He claimed he will just donate it to goodwill. He closed the ebay case.  now 2 weeks later, he now wants a full refund.  

I feel now I CAN ask for the item back, and due to the closed ebay case... I DO NOT have to pay for the return shipping (he does). Do I have this leverage with EBAY and Paypal? 

Will Paypal deduct the rest of the refund even if I don't receive my item?

Sorry for the novel. It's my birthday today and this guy is being very unreasonable.

Ebay,Item not received case - odd outcome,"So I'm usually on the selling side of things on eBay.  So, being an unhappy customer is really strange for me.  

I purchased an item on eBay.  The tracking showed it was delivered to a PO box in a different state than I live in.  So I open up an INR case.  The seller was super apologetic and said they would reship when they get more in.  I decided to wait it out a bit and see if they followed through.  A day or two later, I get messages from eBay that the seller escalated the case and it was closed in their favor.  WTF?

From everything I know as a seller, you only escalate cases while you're on the phone with eBay and eBay says they'll close in your favor.  I also am pretty sure eBay CS always checks tracking and makes sure at least zip codes match up.  So this doesn't make any sense to me. I called eBay and had the decision reversed and had them force a refund.  

I'm just so curious.  I asked the seller what happened. They claim they were closing other cases and ebay ""accidentally"" closed mine?  Can this happen?  Has this ever happened to anyone else out there?  I'm not sure how else this would have happened but I can't imagine an eBay rep making such a mistake.  

I have a bad taste in my mouth from all of this and can't figure out if it was really a mistake, if it was a scam, if I should leave negative feedback, or if I should just drop it.   Any insight fellow rebayers?

Thanks.
