Ebay,Getting a PO box?,"I'm about to move cross-country to a cheap apartment where my pathetic rental budget almost guarantees everything received stolen off my porch. As such, I'd like to rent a PO box.

Ebay,Can a buyer open a return case and an hour later close it?,"I will try to make this story short. Buyer wants free shipping, I abide. Buyer emails, says item smells, wants dry cleaning money. I reply, I did not notice any odors, however, you may return for full refund. Buyer says no, wants $10. I reply, it is not my business policy to do partial credit, you may return for full refund. Buyer threatens feedback, I call ebay, they give me a code to use if they leave bad feedback so I can call ebay with code and get it removed. buyer emails again with treat to feedback, I respond, ""why leave neg feedback when I have offered to fully refund you, even tho the item passed all inspection and had no odor""? They keep emailing, I tell them I do not do partial refunds, as it is a common scam some unethical buyer do to get an item for a lower cost, you may return the item for full refund, but please do not contact me further (because she was being very aggressive). Please note: I was very kind and understanding in my emails and have shortened them for this post, I was not angry with her, nor did I accuse her of anything, I simply explained why I do not do partial refunds. Later she opens a return case, fine with me. Then an hour later, it says she closed the case and a note from the buyer said..you reap what you sow. Can she close her own case?

Ebay,Best free ways to automate my small Ebay business?,"Hi all. 

I posted this on another subreddit but I'm just coming here to see what /r/ebay would say !

One of my New Year's resolutions is too automate and organize my business. (packing, posting, etc.....)


I currently do everything manually -- needless to say it's a nightmare:

* I copy paste the buyer's address onto a word page, get it printed, cut the paper the right size and tape it on the envelope.
* I manually insert all of my sales info in excel
* I manually create the lisitings
* etc...


So next year I'll be doing simple things, like buying small labels, buying a tape gun, automating the feedback I give, etc...... to finally get me organized



Any other simple things I can do? (preferably cheap -- I'm a really small seller) What about apps to automate the excel part? Buying a dedicated label printer ?

How do y'all do it?

Ebay,"New eBay scam, that targets buyers? ""Dummy address""","So, my buddy recently got scammed by a zero-feedback seller. Luckily, he got his money back, but eBay almost sided with the seller. He saw a great deal on a particularly valuable video game - $200 for a normally $500 game. 

He decided to try it,  since eBay protects the buyer pretty well. So, tracking shows up, and the package shows delivered.... in his town, but he has no item in hand. He talks to his local post office repeatedly over the next few days, hoping the item will show up. So, he opens a case, and eBay decides against him. He's got nearly 1000 feedback, and this new seller has zero. Meanwhile, during this fight, a different person leaves feedback for the seller:

""theif, seller deliberately sent dummy item to wrong address""

So, he calls eBay, and they required he get a letter from the post office stating that the item wasn't delivered to him. Luckily, he's in a small town, so that was possible. Meanwhile, those of us in larger cities would be screwed. He got his money back, and the seller has been banned. Meanwhile, I fear that this will become the new scam. 

Any advice on how to avoid getting screwed by this scam?",15.0,5,2015-01-02,EBAY,0.04194024205207825,0.9148573875427246,0.043202418833971024
Ebay,Guy wants to pick up. How should I go about it to protect myself the most?,"So I get a message and a buyer says he lives 10 mins away from my area and wants to pick up.  Sure, so I add local pick up as an option and tell him if he wins we'll meet somewhere locally and I'll bring the item.  
  
Anyway, when he goes and bids, I find he has 0 feedback which makes me a bit wary but nonetheless, we all had to start somewhere so I'm gonna go see how it pans out.  
  
I'm certain he's not a scammer because picking up items aren't protected by buyer protection anymore and he could scam without local pick up and just had me ship it.  
  
I know cash is the best option for doing local pick up but I didn't put the ""contact me for payment at pick up"" clause in the auction in time so I'm gonna have to settle with paypal.  So the only possible issue I could run into is if he does a CC chargeback on his paypal payment.  
  
Other than that, is there anything else I can do to protect myself?",5.0,4,2015-01-02,EBAY,0.03183155134320259,0.9303954243659973,0.037773068994283676
Ebay,Atrocious INAD case experience with Customer Service and not sure what to do.,"I purchased an item on eBay from a low feedback overseas seller. Upon receipt, it was an obvious counterfeit from glaring errors not apparent in the listing's photos. I opened an INAD case, where the seller declined a return and offered back half of the purchase price. Obviously not content with this, I escalated the case. eBay took over a week to respond to me and I finally received a response yesterday with a request from the manufacturer or an authorized dealer to prove that the item is in fact counterfeit. They have given me only three business days to come up with this or the case will be closed. 

The manufacturer is not only located in Germany and I'm in the US, but they do not not offer authentication services. If by some miracle they agreed, they would require I sent the item in to them and they would destroy it for being an illegal infringement on their copyright. Dealers wouldn't waste their time authenticating a pre-owned item with no benefit to them (ie potential sale). 

I compiled a document with a photo of the item I received showing the obvious errors versus the authentic version, a link to a counterfeit sales website where the same errors are shown on the counterfeit for sale, and a link and photo of the authentic item, all providing very obvious proof that I received a counterfeit.

 The CS rep then said this information was not good enough and I needed information submitted by a third party by 1/6. I am dumbfounded at how asinine this requirement is when I have done absolutely nothing wrong but the burden of proof is placed on me and I am given three business days to find a third party willing to prove my case. I spent over $150k through eBay in 2014 and sold another $50k with them. After this debacle they'll never get another dime from me. 

Has anyone been put in a similiar situation with eBay CS before? How did it turn out? Is there anything else I can do? I'm most likely going to lose this case after doing absolutely nothing wrong.",16.0,3,2015-01-02,EBAY,0.10177750885486603,0.8683947324752808,0.02982773445546627
Ebay,What is the best way to sell multiple items from a list - e.g. a list of 100+ VHS tapes,"When I first started picking I got excited and bought 200 to 300 VHS tapes or so. I started listing them but only a handful sold so I removed all listings. 

I'm about to give it another go. 

Frankly I just want to get rid of them. I don't need to maximize profits, but if I have to individually list them I would want to get something for my time. 

My feeling is that if I list 300 all individually priced, I'll probably sell 10% over time - so largely it will be a waste of time. 

In Australia postage costs are high, and an individual VHS tape will cost around $7.50 + envelope, whereas if I bundle approx 10 tapes (maybe 13) the postage will be around $15.00.

So I'm thinking that it would be best to have a deal whereby someone can get the second VHS for a much lower price. 

Could you let me know how best to structure this. 

If it were allowed (ebay rules) then maybe it would be ideal to have a text based list of all VHS tapes - without photos - maybe with just a short condition description for each (Very Good condition, Adequate) - and an individual price for each. 

If I could get away with a text based list it would save me a lot of time and effort in the listing process, but as I say I'm mainly concerned about getting rid of them - ideally at a modest profit. 

Also, I have a few tapes which may be worth a fair bit individually - so I guess with those ones I would be happy to do a proper listing, with full description and photos and have to have them separately marked from whatever bundle deal I mention for the bulk of the VHS tapes. 

If I can get the right solution, then I might start buying more VHS tapes (if they sell ok), or I might think of doing something for records (LPs) as i've recently bought far too many of them, and again individual postage is quite high.",1.0,2,2015-01-02,EBAY,0.026374386623501778,0.9209587574005127,0.05266686528921127

Ebay,I think someone might be trying to scam me (help!),"Hey everyone,

Recently I sold a video game on ebay for about 40 dollars.  It's an older game, so I made sure to test it prior to putting it up for sale.  The item sells and I ship it out, and a little while later, I get a message from the buyer saying it doesn't work, etc.  

My first instinct is to give the guy a refund and ask for my game back, but I've been scammed like this before; last year I sold a video game for 80.00 USD.  The buyer complained that it didn't work, and I gave him a refund, and he sends me it back.  However, the guy who scammed me opened up the game cartridge that I sent him, replaced it with a broken copy of the game, and sent it back to me.  BAM, I just lost 80 dollars. 

The (current) guy that is claiming that his game is broken is sketchy: he's a new ebay user, no previous purchases, no previous feedback, and has a strange username of seemingly random letters.  Also, his messages are very similar to the guy who scammed me beforehand.  

What should I do about this?  I presented the previous scam to ebay, with picture proof of the tampered return item, but they said there was nothing they could do.  I really want to believe that this guy is legit, and the game somehow doesn't work, but seeing as I tested the game before I listed it, and before I shipped it, and it worked fine, I just don't see how that is probable.

Ebay,How do I report an eBay member for threats/abuse/harassment??,"Over the past few days I've had an eBay member contacting me, saying he's bought something of mine 5 times, each with different accounts for which he's now forgotten all of the passwords and usernames, and that if I don't ship the product ASAP he'll sue me. 

Obviously this guy's just doing an awful job at trying to get some free stuff or something, and of course I won't be sending him anything, as he is referring to orders that have never been placed and so on.

Bottom line: how do I report him? I know I can block him from being able to contact me but I want eBay to know about this crap.

Ebay,"Best Way To Sell? (New, just got scammed)","Hey all, I'm an owner of a new account. I have an older account with some feedback on it, but I've used eBay maybe a handful of times over a year + ago. I recently declined buy now bids during my items first listing due to my own suspected fraud on the buyers half. 
This time was another story though. As I said, I'm very new and naive to the bad ""Internet"" people out there. He threw up some fake images saying he paid for the item, and that some buyer protection meant the payment wouldn't be released until after the item got there. I know, now it sounds ridiculously stupid. Anyhow, the only reason I found out this was a scam was luckily the POS deleted his eBay account after I sent the item to USPS yesterday for priority delivery, in which eBay sent me a suspicious buyer message, etc. I contacted eBay today, and luckily/s for me the USPS store is closed Sunday, and I'm just really hoping it doesn't get delivered by Monday.

Ebay,"How do you win a case if buyer is abusing the ""not as described"" option to force you to pay return shipping.","I'm a pretty prolific seller on ebay, but I haven't encountered this problem yet.

Basically, I sold a game system (I tested it thoroughly and packaged it extremely well - as I always do), the buyer received it, then on the very last day of my return policy (14-day), they requested a return, stating that the item didn't work.

I asked them if there were signs of damage when it arrived and they said that there wasn't.  

Since they opened a return with ""damaged/not as described"", I have to pay the return shipping (otherwise they would, per my return policy).  

It could be that the system was somehow damaged internally in-transit, but, I think they found a better deal and are forcing a return on my dime. 

My question is: if I took a video of me opening the returned item, and testing it, would ebay even consider this as proof of them abusing the system and not make me pay the return shipping?

I then went to the local post office 3x and made 3 calls to the USPS call center. They said there was a mistake made with the hold and that the package was lost.

I contacted the seller and they said the post office is giving them a hard time about it. Now I'm out the money I spent on the auction.

One of his ""feedback as a buyer"" comments is ""BEWARE SELLERS! [buyer] IS A FRAUD AND WILL CON YOU!"", however he has recent positive feedback, the ebay/paypal shipping address is eligible for seller protection, and I got paid, so I go ahead and ship.



Oops.

Out of caution, I message the seller who left the warning to ask if he'd mind sharing his experience with this particular buyer. Apparently, the buyer bought a $400 new game console and while it was in transit, his partner/wife filed an unauthorized charge claim through paypal. In the end, the seller was able to intercept the package before it was delivered, but lost $80 in shipping and other fees in doing so.

Ebay,iPhone Reselling,"Hi Guys,

It's a long shot but hey. 

I purchased a faulty iPhone 5 back in June 2014 off of eBay. Basically the battery was extremely poor and the phone got very hot when charging.

I received the phone and replaced the battery which luckily also fixed the heat problem. 

I tested the phone thoroughly and ensured there wasn't an iCloud lock etc... 

In November I then relisted the phone on eBay as a working phone and made a little profit. The buyer lived local so came and collected the phone, everything was fine. 

At the end of December, the person I sold the phone to contacted me stating the phone had been subject to an insurance claim and that the IEMI number had been blocked by the carrier (meaning it doesn't get any signal).

I explained I purchased the phone off of eBay and that I was not the one that made the claim. However she filed a complaint with Paypal who demanded I paid the money back which I didn't really have a problem with. I then received said phone a week later. 

Now at this point I am at a loss and stuck with a useless phone. So I messaged the person I purchased the phone from on eBay explaining what had happened and that I would like the phone unblocked or a refund arranged. I never got a response so I took to Paypal/eBay and started to try and file a case but because I purchased the phone now over the 3 months buyer guarantee I don't seem to have any ground to stand on.

My question is do people actually make money that way?  Paypal takes $.30 per transaction + about 3% so that's $.33 gone right away.  

Ebay takes their cut which is probably around $.05.  

That leaves about $1.  In that $1 is the price of shipping + the price of the item + I would think some profit for the seller.  

Are the bulk prices the seller buys the items at just that low combined with heavily discounted shipping rates?

Ebay,Buyer claiming false allegations to defective item,"I sold Red Dead Redemption and the buyer contacted me with this message.

""I got my item, thanks. But the bottom closure tab inside the case is broken so the case doesn't snap shut, the normal game disc is scratched, the undead nightmare disc is heavily scratched, and the cover art has a small tear on the edge of the top lefthand corner. I would like a refund of $6 and I'll keep it and leave perfect feedback. Otherwise, I would like a pre-paid shipping label to return it to you for a full refund.""

Right off the bat, in the photos the case closes perfectly and there are no tears. I don't have a photo of the discs but I do know they worked perfectly fine and had no defects. 

I find it extremely odd that he wants $6 out of the $10 and change he spent and he'll keep it and leave me positive feedback, almost like it isn't actually broken and he's threatening to leave negative feedback if I don't  give him the option to keep it with a $6 refund (like it's fine but he just regrets spending $4 more than he wants back) or B. give a full refund and take it back.

What can I do?

Conclusion: So after I sent a message trying to reason with the buyer, I got in touch with eBay and they were great about it. The guy on the phone sided with me 100% and was fast and courteous. However the buyer continued insisting the item had all the defects he named and he said that he would ""let eBay handle it now"". Well I told him that I had already contacted eBay as he had violated the terms of services and that he would be receiving a warning. After that he said he saw that and thanked me for my aggression, and told me that this was the worst experience he ever had with a seller. 

He then went on to say in the same message that he only wanted a partial refund so he could go and buy a new case and artwork because he can still play the game just fine, and that he was looking out for my costs while telling me that now this will affect the ""feedback I will eventually leave"".

I told him that my photos showing the case in perfect condition and him confirming the games work were all that were needed for eBay to remove any negative feedback he plans on leaving, and I thanked him for his business and told him to enjoy the games.",7.0,4,2015-01-10,EBAY,0.10908856242895126,0.8576804399490356,0.03323096036911011

Ebay,"Buyer claiming problem with item they bought, it was large and expensive to ship, what to do?","Hi there.

Been selling on ebay for years, never had a single problem, now I have a problem I am afraid of.

I sold an electric piano on ebay. The piano is fairly large and heavy (a Yamaha P-85) and I sold it with a stand and seat. I shipped the piano in it's original packaging (which is how it was shipped to me new several years ago) and I think it was adequately protected. I shipped via Fedex, no insurance, just a declared value. I had to ship the piano, stand and seat in three separate packages, totaling around $85.

The buyer has only 2 feedback but has been a ebay member since 2001 (according to their profile). They are claiming the headphone jack does not fully work, that it only outputs sound mainly in one ear. In their first message they said the piano is useless to them without the headphone jack working and would contact ebay to get their money back if I cant help. I have messaged back and forth to make sure they are using stereo headphones and the correct adapter. They say they are. I have not asked if the package was damaged, they did not say anything about it.

That is the end of my communication for now, as I am not sure what to do. The headphone jacks worked when I sent it out, the only way they could have broken would be due to damage or rough handling during shipping dislodging a connection.

Should I attempt to contact Fedex about this, what would I do? Should I ask the buyer if the package looks damaged? What if it doesn't looked damaged, but it was handled roughly which caused the jack to break?

What if the buyer is just trying to get me to send them a discount by lying about something?

The original ebay listing said no refunds accepted, I know the buyer is still protected under item not as described protection.

I am willing to let the buyer ship it back to me at their own expense, but I know they will be pissed and probably not want to pay $85 and haul the whole thing to a shipping office. I would be pissed too.

Not sure what to do. Any advice appreciated!",10.0,3,2015-01-10,EBAY,0.05076300725340843,0.9091967940330505,0.04004022106528282

I don't have a lot of experience, so I'm just trying to understand what happened.  I thought that when an item was purchased, eBay would automatically confirm the shipping based on the method I selected and the location of the buyer, and they would be able to pay the full amount immediately via PayPal - but it looks as though this wasn't the case and I had no visibility that they were not able to pay, all I could see was that I was awaiting payment.",4.0,2,2015-01-10,EBAY,0.12231722474098206,0.8410603404045105,0.036622386425733566

Ebay,Buyers not wanting to pay calculated shipping cost after winning item,"How do you guys deal with this?  I have a guy whose calculated rate was $11 and he's telling me after winning that it shouldn't cost more than a few bucks to send it (he's on the other side of the country).  He claims he doesn't care how slow it gets there; I said calculated parcel post was only $2 cheaper.  If that too wasn't satisfactory I said I would offer the item to the 2nd chance bidder.

Granted, I start with all 99 cent auctions so I leave ample padding in the shipping weight to recoup some costs/fees if it only sells for a buck. But if you win an item for less than a damn dollar and the calculated cost was displayed for 7 days for you to see, how can you then debate it with the seller before paying?

Thanks for any advice.  eBay is barely worth the hassle these days

Ebay,It's first time selling something expensive. Does this buyer look suspicious to you guys?,"I recently started selling on ebay to just sell some of my stuff I dont use, and I listed my new camera(I didn't use it, so still new, unopend) for $185, and a buyer bought it and paid the money right away. I checked the buyer, and the buyer had his account since 2008, but he has only 3 positive feedbacks. One from this year and two from past year. He asked me if I could leave the tracking number to him, and which shipping method I'm going to use.(I offered free shipping to avoid any hassles that charging shipping fees might cause)

Those questions just look like general guestions but he has only 3 positive feedbacks and he has not left any feedback on any seller.

I know everyone start from zero feedbacks, and I can't really judge buyers based on how many feedbacks they have because he maybe just kinda guy who uses ebay very rarely. Well, anyways it's my first time selling something over $100, and I'm kinda nervous and want to make sure I don't get to lose money/item from buyer abusing the system.

Ebay,A Complex question for Ebay employees... please help if you can!,"Hi Everyone, and especially to ebay employees.

I recently bought a large number of items that were shipped through the global shipping program. They were contracted out to PostNL, from WN Direct, who failed to inform the sender (Pitney Bowes) that they do not deliver to Belgium Post addresses.

Of course, I was only able to find this out by going up the customer support chain with PostNL, who promised to deliver, and then were unable to, and everything was RTS'ed.

Unfortunately, the tracking states ""Delivery Refused by Customer"" or ""Invalid Address"". I was able to get the Customer Service head of PostNL to admit the delivery issue was one on their end. Now, I've also been in contact with Pitney Bowes, who state they can re-deliver but it's about a 6 week process. 

I opened claims with ebay, just to find out who was the carrier for the items in the first place, since a number of them did not update in My Ebay and you can't search a global tracking number. Thing is, I don't want a refund. I want my things.

I also know, because of the complicated nature of ebay claims it will take some time if I go that route, and one seller is already furious with me (fairly) because ebay froze their funds.

Trouble is, if I wait for Pitney Bowes, if their are issues (and my faith with PB is already very, very low) I will be outside the time frame to make a claim. And if it doesn't work out, I'll be out 500 EUR.

Ebay,"New seller question: I sold an item as broken/for parts, now the buyer wants a refund because the item is broken and ""not as described. What do I do?","Hi

I've recently started selling some stuff from around my house on eBay. I'm new to selling stuff on eBay. This item is the fourth thing I've sold. 

I sold an older MacBook Air that was broken under ebays broken/for parts category. My listing went like this: 

First I listed the computer specs, then I said "" THIS IS A BROKEN, NON FUNCTIONAL COMPUTER. this computer has been in my family since new in 2012, but has not worked for about a year so I'm selling it to someone who could use it for parts. I do not know why the computer does not work although I'd be willing to answer any questions that I can."" 

In addition, the listing title was ""BROKEN Mac book air.""

I listed it, and someone bought it for the buy it now price within a couple hours. I shipped it that day. 

This person received the computer today, and is now requesting a return because the computer is not as described. 

He says that one of the chips or memory devices inside the computer has a crack in it or something, and that also the battery has a crack in it, and that the computer is beeping. he says that the cracked pieces kill the part out value. 

First off, the computer was not beeping when I shipped it, and it had been sitting dead in a closet for a year so I doubt it would have battery to beep. What does the beeping mean? I don't know. 

Secondly, I never opened up the computer to see what it looked like inside. I don't have the technical skill or tiny screwdrivers to do that and I would be afraid of breaking something. I didn't explicitly state that I didn't know what the insides looked like, but I think I made it clear that I didn't know what is wrong with the computer and that the seller was buying a broken computer. 

Third, he's now taken the computer apart, which means that I have no promise that I'm not going to be receiving a pile of computer parts if I do accept a return. Also, how do I know that the computer wasn't damaged more as he was taking it apart. 

But I don't think I should have to accept a return, he bought a computer that I made clear had an unknown problem and is now angry that it has a problem, so what should I do?

The transaction was through PayPal, and the payment was received by PayPal, but still pending for me, and it should be available on the 14th. 

Can I deny his return request? If I'd can deny his request and he makes a dispute with PayPal or ebay, what happens?

Ebay,"I think I might be getting scammed, need help.","Hey guys, I was selling my iPhone 5s and got bids with a few hours remaining. However, they were very odd and sporadic.

This happens a couple of times. A few days ago, I managed to win one of the 6 items I wanted to buy from the seller. I would like to send the seller a message asking if I could just buy out the remaining items for the average price that they sold for. Is that even possible, or allowed on eBay? If so, would I be protected by eBay if the seller does agree and rips me off?

Is it just stuck in customs and taking months to get through? What's the problem here?

update: Contacted ebay and essentially they told me that I'm screwed because the tracking number says that the item has not arrived to the buyer.  They then told me to contact USPS customer service to see if they could pull up any more information on the item.  I contact the USPS and they state that since the item was sent first class, they cannot make an inquiry on the item.  They said that the next time I send a package to an international country that you should send the item EXPRESS postage or PRIORITY mail.

Ebay,Scammers based in Dominican Republic?,"Short story time. Also a bit of a rant at the end. Sorry about that.  

I'm new to selling on ebay and my first item was my old Galaxy S3 phone for $110.  I had a buyer pretty much that night, but then things got weird.  He sent money on paypal and then it was cancelled shortly after.  I got a message the next day from the guy (only spoke spanish) saying that he was paying on his phone and then the phone died, cancelling the order, but he didn't get his money back.  He submitted a money request for the amount of the order, but I never saw his other cancelled payment on my activity history.  

It felt fishy so i messaged him back saying I don't have the money, and that I would give him 4 days to pay (in case the money got caught in some bank-limbo, which happens sometimes).  Four days go by, he doesn't pay, so i cancel it.  I make note that although his ebay account says he's based in the Dominican Republic, his shipping information is in southern Florida. He also had 20-something positive reviews, most of them copied word for word.

I reposted the phone shortly after cancelling(earlier today), and tonight I get a nice offer from another user, but I check his info beforehand.  This new guy was also based in the Dominican Republic, had a shipping address in southern Florida, and had 20-something positive reviews, copied mostly word for word.

So I guess my question is, is this a common scam?  I found it odd that these guys could buy my items, although they're based in the Dominican Republic and have that floridian address.  I consider myself lucky to be internet-savvy enough to know not to trust everyone who wants to buy my things, but feel bad that there are a number of other users that get screwed by scams like this (implying it is a scam).

I respond to her over paypal dispute resolution.  I deny a refund and tell her I wanna try my best to resolve the issue.  I say the sets come sealed, and ask if there was anything wrong with the set.  I also ask her to take pictures.

How should I approach this to ensure I have the best possible outcome?  Is there any way to ""win"" this dispute?  What do I have to say or show to paypal to prove that I provide whole, complete sets?

Ebay,eBay Watermark shows a different user ID than mine!?,"I listed a dozen items for auction last night and I noticed this morning (while trying to list more items) that the watermarked eBay user ID is different than mine. I have the settings on eBay set up so that the photos I upload are watermarked with my user ID. Standard fraud protection.


I've been on the phone with eBay for over an hour as of this post (currently on hold for the 6th time with my 4th representative). So far, they've suggested that I've upload the photos from the wrong folder, that I'm using pictures pulled off the internet, and if I've changed my user ID within the last few hours.  My frustration level is climbing higher by the minute.


I suggest you all double check your recent listings and keep an eye out!


Is anyone else having this issue as well?


EDIT: After over 90 minutes on the phone with eBay, they have created a work ticket for their technical team.  The user ID showing up on my watermark refers to a random user on the other side of the country.  In the mean time, I am holding off on listing items.

Ebay,"I think I've been scammed on Ebay, is there ANYTHING I can do?","Right before Christmas (Dec 16th) I found an item on Ebay. This was something I'd need before NYE, and as luck had it, the seller mentioned in the ad that he would be willing to sell it before auction ends, if anyone needed it before. So I fired a message, and we agreed on a BIN price that was basically the opening price, 500$. Since I would need the item for NYE, and the seller is located in Canada, and me in Norway, I decided to use UPS Worldwide Express, which cost 150$...so now we're at 650$.

The seller sends me his Paypal address (red flag nr. 1), and tells me to send the payment as a personal payment(red flag nr. 2, but I could understand this). I was reluctant, but in desperation, I sent the money. The seller had positive feedback, most recent just a couple of days old, on an item same price. Did a fast search on the sellers nick, and I found him on a forum, some other classifieds sites with a 3/4 year history of selling the same stuff, everything seemed to add up. 

So after I send the money, I don't get any ""money received"" or anything. The next day I ask if he had shipped it out? I got a ""Yeah, thanks."", we're now on the 17th or 18th. 
I ask for a tracking number, but no answer. 

Since I was following the original ad, I now see that he hasn't closed it down, but rather just changed the text/heading/pictures, and is selling something else. I guess the seller was just lazy on this one, but to be safe, I get a friend overseas to send a message if he still has the original item, but got a ""sorry, it's sold"". 

Try again, 10 days later, but no answer. Nothing. 

NYE comes, and no package. Keep in mind that this shipping option is FAST, as in 3-5 business days guaranteed, but I hadn't even gotten a message from Customs at this point. 

Tried again a week ago, an got an instant auto reply ""Dear Friends

I am going away for a family vacation beginning 21st Dec to 21st Jan. Wish You all Merry XMas and Happy New Year!!

Cheers""

I've done thousands of deals on the net, and to be honest, I've yet to be scammed. I don't know if this is a scam, or just a seller with really poor communication skills, and why the package still hasn't arrived. Did he ever send it? Did skimp on the shipping? Downgrading the shipping, and keeping the change...he even got a new positive rating on Ebay, while all this was going on, from someone buying something similar. 

Anyway, is there ANYTHING I can do? 
I sent the money via paypal personal payment, that was linked to my debit card. 

Give some strategies here, as this is the first time. 

TL;DR 
-Find auction, buy it off ebay from seller.
-Send personal payment, pay for express shipping since I needed it for NYE. 
-Haven't heard anything in a month now. Never got tracking number. Item never arrived.  
-Seller has a seemingly clean history.

Ebay,Help!! Bidder just sent me a message saying refuses to pay..,"Hello, 

I am not sure where to go with this. I was counting on the money from a number of items I put on eBay. These are items I didn't want to part with but needed the money ASAP and knew they would sell for a fair amount. 

There is one item that has done especially well, however this morning I received this message:

&gt; ""I m currently the highest bidder but unfortunately if I win the auction I will not be able to purchase the shirt because it is the wrong size, sorry for the inconvenience but I thought I should let you know ahead of time. Sorry again but that is only if I win the auction.""

I am not sure what I can do–the item ends Sunday evening, he has been the high bidder for four days and this is the first I am hearing about it. Every time he was outbid over the course of the first three days he would bid higher. I am livid and feel helpless in this situation. Is the buyer still responsible if he wins?

Ebay,buyer claims pants aren't the right size,"Sold some jeans to a guy. No returns listing. (I usually do a return if the buyer asks anyways) He got them today and messaged me something along the lines of 

""Are these jeans sized wrong? They fit differently than the other 34x30's that I wear""

I explain that indeed they are sized correctly, linked him to the manufacturers website to the item and its size guide. In their size guide it talks about vanity sizes and I explain to him that sometimes manufacturers have vanity sizing which means that in their brand you wear a 34, but your actual size is a 36. 

""I wish you would have mentioned to check the site before ordering, these jeans don't fit. I've had several different pairs of jeans from different manufacturers and they don't fit like this""

""I'm sorry you had an issue with the item. I wear 34x30 and never had a problem with these. They are marked 34x30.""

""They do say 34x30, but if you knew that they didn't fit like regular 34x30 jeans like in the link that you sent me, you should have stated that in the description.""

""They fit me the same as my Levi's. By mall brands I mean American Eagle, Aeropostale, Abercrombie&amp; Fitch. ""

""I wear Levis on a daily basis,  and theses jeans absolutely do not fit like levis. I will just make a claim with ebay, and let then review the messages that we sent to each other, and let them settle the case. I feel that you weren't 100 percent honest. I have a 100% good rating.""

So I'm not sure if I should respond or not. 

These jeans are the same sizing as levis. If you measure the waist it will show 34 inches. Maybe hes used to a more relaxed fit, or has vanity sized jeans as I mentioned. I copy and pasted the description the manufacturer uses for the jeans onto my listing.

But he never asked for a refund or to return it, just claimed I am lying and is going to escalate to ebay, who is gonna tell him ""work it out with the buyer"" and then they'll step in after a few days. 

""100% rating"" as a buyer? no way!

Ebay,I had to pay extra shipping charges on an item I won on eBay. It wasn't much but it's the principle of the thing! Can I ask the seller to reimburse me?,"I won a woodworking bench plane on eBay with a shipping cost of $5.95.  When the item was due to arrive, instead I received a pink slip from USPS saying that I owed the m $3.63 and I can pick up the item at the post office.  The next day, I went down, paid them, and got my item.

I've messaged the seller and asked him to reimburse the difference to me but he said ""I paid what eBay estimated.  I am not refunding for weight.""

I looked through the auction listing to make sure it didn't say ""Buyer is responsible for all shipping costs."" anywhere so I think the Seller is responsible unless it's a global eBay rule that the Buyer assumes all shipping costs.

I've never given negative feedback before but I can't help but feel like it's merited in this situation.  I've given the seller as much a chance as possible to fix the situation but he seems bent on not adhering to eBay rules.

Ebay,Buyer opened a case and then never replied,"Buyer opened a not as described/doesn't match auction return case on a lot of figures I sold.

I asked what was wrong and offered a refund about an hour after the case was opened, but it's been five days and the buyer hasn't replied at all. Ebay says the refund is due on the 22nd, and that I can also escalate the case on the 22nd. Will eBay automatically refund the buyer if I haven't already, even though they never replied?

What I did so far:

1) Wrote him back saying that my item was accurately described, and he should have asked questions before spending this kind of money

2) Told him that I am willing to make a second chance offer to the 2nd highest bidder as a sign of good will, but that there will be consequences if this doesn't go through, since he made a binding offer, and my auction was fully compliant with the rules.


So, other than wait for the second place bidder to reply, what do I do now? Would you report this guy and leave negative feedback, or is it not worth it?

Ebay,"Paypal dispute against me, buyer seems blind?","Hey guys. In the fall I accidently purchased a 2 pack game on Steam though I only wanted it for myself. So I listed the spare copy on eBay.

So for 3 weeks I occasionally been resending him the gift hoping he'd notice, messaged him 3 times on ebay and once directly to his paypal email. He didn't respond one.

Then some time around Christmas he opens a case on eBay claiming he never received the item :o I reply saying that I did my best but he never accepted the gift. I asked him to either add me to friends or provide his steam name so I can add him and send gift directly. He didn't respond.

So now I get an email that he opened a dispute on paypal and they froze those pathetic $10. I can either provide proof that I shipped (probably impossible since it's a virtual item), refund or provide proof that the buyer has already been refunded.

Ebay,"Total newbie at selling on ebay. Need advice, possibly getting scammed?","I have only completed a couple sales on ebay; the first few sales went through with no problems.

Today, I was contacted by a buyer that he no longer wanted an item about a day after he had already placed the winning bid and the auction ended.

Luckily, I haven't shipped the item yet. His PayPal payment has already gone through as well. 

I have read a lot of scary stuff about PayPal, and feel like I might be getting led into some kind of scam, but I honestly don't know. Can I just issue the refund? Is he going to get account info or something when I do this? I looked into his background; his user profile states South Korea, but he was shipping to a San Francisco, CA address, which instantly makes me suspicious.

Am I just being overly paranoid, or do I have reason to be worried? Anybody have good info about how to avoid common ebay/PayPal scams as I continue selling on ebay?

I received my band today and I'm a bit confused. I was having trouble synching the band to my phone and did some searching and it looks like the band is an ""UP"" and not the ""UP24"" which is what I purchased. The pkg says that it's an up24 but the the band is the ""UP""

I've attached pics

Please contact me as soon as you can

Him:
Hmm that is strange. Id be more than happy to find some trouble shooting. What kind of phone do u have? And not connecting at all? That is strange. And if you van gind it again , could you send me a link that says that. Thank you

Me:
Did u get the pics I sent?

I downloaded the UP app and chose the ""UP24"" and it said it couldn't find it. (I have an iPhone 6)

I searched for instructions online and by the pics it had the different band and looked like the old generation UP not the 24. So I went back into the program and picked the old gen UP and it told me to plug it in and then it synched. The band just says UP on it also

Him:
I didn't get any pics

Me:
I resent the pics

Him:
So ive just Googled thd wristband. And its rendered to as both up and up 24. Ive attached a picture of the search. And ive checked into the issue regarding your phone. Apparently the iPhone itself takes the place of the bracelet. Thats really does suck im sorry that happend. But, I can bet that next month list it, you will make a profit I've been selling them 80-110 that was my last one. Again I do apologize that reAlly is bad luck that apple did that. Smh.keep in Mind not every one has an iphone. 2 weeks might het that luck back. If it was still unused and sealed I wouldve gladly honored a return for this. But think about whAt I said those r the new ""fad"" I really would appreciate an honest feedback from you.I hope you understand. If you have any other questions or anything please don't hesitate to message me. 

Me:
Your response is totally confusing. There isn't anything wrong with my phone or Apple. The jawbone I received was the first generation UP when your ad clearly stated my purchase was for the UP24. I took it out of the pkg and it didn't work as stated because the old generation UP doesn't work wirelessly so it's now back in the pkg. 
I'm sending it back this isn't what I purchased 

Him:
The up and the up 24 are reffered to as both as per 1st page searched quoting YouTube as well as AT&amp;amp;T. One again I wish I could help. But at this point you are being rude. So im going to have to ask you to refrain from messaging me. Thank you

Me:
So at this point I just filed a claim with eBay which he responded to. 

Him:
Please dont make this become an Issue. I asked your issue, I got a many accusations. I asked your phone looked up your reasons research came back that you buy the item and apple turned it in to an app.its bad luck and again I would honor a return but the item has been opened. You recieved the exact item listed and was provide woth the model shown on the box. Please I im really not dealing with this. I tried to help even said your likely to profitoff it next month. So please drop this ridiculous request when im donewith what I am doing I will be reporting you. If would like to beat me to then please. You are harassing me I asked you to refrain from messaging me.those messages are on their data base regardless of deleting them. So please rjust re read them, and think if your blowing some thing put of proportion to jepordize your rating and anything else ebay does idk. But its not worth it. I am sorry no return will be honored.

Me:
I will be perusing this with eBay. You obviously didn't understand what my my concern was and haven't responded to my questions. 
I purchased an UP24, per your ad and that's not what I received. I received the older generation UP. I did get it to sync with my phone it has nothing to do with Apple. It wasn't synching because I was following the instructions for the 24 but the band isn't a 24! That's my problem.
You obviously don't have integrity if you're lying about what u sell. I won't do the same to someone else as u suggested.

We haven't worked out a deal yet but if I agree to post/sell all the stuff on Ebay I will get around %30 but if we give it to someone else to sell on consignment they will probably get %30 and I'll get like %5-%10 as a finders fee.

My natural inclination is just to decline the return, and I assume I will get negative feedback.  However can the buyer force the return anyway or what?

I don't offer returns as part of my policy.  I do know buyers can still try to return items anyway and had to deal with this a year ago when a buyer said a new product was opened.

Ebay,Update: Help with buyer blatantly lying and filing SNAD PayPal dispute against me?,"Here's an update from this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/2spu0i/help_with_buyer_blatantly_lying_and_filing_snad/) I started last week 

Basically, PayPal sided with the buyer.  

They claimed that they were sent rocks, which I didn't, in order to keep the item and get refunded for it.  I take a hit on my reputation and the sinking feeling that someone was able to take advantage of my business and I wasn't able to do anything about it.  It was her word against mine, and despite having a clean selling record, they side with the buyer... when you think about it, it would be completely stupid of me to scam someone out of one purchase when I could make so much more by continuing to do things legit.

I see no way how I could have argued my case any better.  I don't know what proof I could have sent to make them side with me.

Ebay,Using email regarding a sale,"Hello, I am trying to get a good answer on this that I might be able to use to justify my position from somewhere in eBay's policies. 

Backstore-
Buyer recently purchased something; it's a tech item, so I'm always very careful about what I'm posting, shipping, etc. I specified in my listing that, due to the nature of shipping and insuring the package, I would invoice them with final shipping costs in the event that shipping turned out to be less than I set (I set it manually this time). Auction closed, I invoiced, buyer paid. Buyer messages me via eBay after payment asking me to send him shipping information via email. 

My question: as a matter of course, I *never* **ever** use any forms of communication when I'm selling outside of eBay messenger; I got a negative feedback because someone claimed I wasn't responding to their messages, though I have no record of any messages from the buyer. Furthermore, I don't really want them to have my personal email (at least, without having to dig around for it). I just prefer to have everything documented in eBay's systems. I wasn't sure what to do, so I emailed the buyer the information and also sent the same message via eBay messenger. In both cases, I said that ""I don't handle any communications outside of eBay messenger because it protects both of us from liability."" 

I was always under the impression that, for most purposes, it's not a good idea- if not actually disallowed by eBay policies- to communicate outside of eBay with your buyer about sales details. Am I in the wrong for thinking this and sticking firmly to my ""no mail outside eBay messenger"" policy?

Ebay,"Massive mistake at the Post Office, how to avoid defects.","(ebay UK)
I am a business seller doing 25-100 products in envelopes daily, some of these parcels are meant to be tracked and some arn't.

I drop all my mail off in a bag at the PO daily and then it gets processed and sent.
Well yesterday it got dropped off and then apparently a worker just gave it straight to the mailman without paying for anything, so they just sent out addressed envelopes with no payment on them.

If I refund people postage costs through paypal in advance will it cause me defects?

I told buyer to check out their shopping cart from a computer browser. Today they write back and say it doesn't work, and they include their shipping address, and no shit if it isn't in CANADA, I place I do not ship to. I only do international shipping via GSP and I don't care who likes it. When you accept a Best Offer, the B/O review page shows the potential buyer's shipping Zip Code, so you can figure out what to charge them. This person's B/O page showed an address in Maryland.

Hello everyone, I have a buyer who is having an error message when trying to make a payment. At first, they messaged me saying the checkout was adding a shipping fee, even though the item had free shipping. I heard in other sellers groups recently that there have been glitches going around eBay, so I told them perhaps it was a glitch and that I would send them an invoice via eBay messages and they could pay from there. Today the buyer messages again and says they are getting an error message in red saying ""invalid shipping, please enter valid shipping, shipping not specified"". The buyer wants to give me their shipping address directly but I'm pretty sure that's not correct. I believe they should change their shipping address through Paypal if that is the problem they are having, but maybe it is just a glitch. Is this a known issue anyone has heard of before? Or perhaps the buyer is having an issue with Paypal? Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you so much!",8.0,3,2015-01-23,EBAY,0.06476937234401703,0.9021943807601929,0.033036258071660995
Ebay,First Auction Story,"I decided to start selling some of my video games and maybe starting a store of sorts if I find enough fine things to sell later on.

My very first auction went up to $90 or so, and I'm all excited to make my first sale. The winning bidder sends me this message:

""Hi i just won the bid for X &amp; the shipping info needs to be Inputted""

I was confused because I set the shipping to the automated one that adjusts based on where you're buying from. I replied right back

""Hi there! And thank you so much for your purchase! This is my first time doing this so you'll have to bear with me. I assume I can just send you an invoice with your preferred shipping method. Do you have a preference? Or shall I just look for the most inexpensive one possible?""

Then for a day she never replied, I looked up all the shipping info for her area and picked out the least expensive shipping fees and sent her another. 

""I did some research, it looks like Small Packet (Ground, $5.00) and Lightpacket (Air, $8.00) are the least expensive. Air would get it to you a bit quicker. Let me know if either of those are fine, or if you'd like something else and I'll send you the invoice then put it in the mail :3""

Then I get this:
""Hey thanks but i decided to go with another one""

I had already read into the policy, and I know that as a buyer you're expected to pay for what you bid on, or it reflects badly on your account. I didn't quite know what to say to her, I couldn't think of a wording that wasn't going to sound rude. So I researched unpaid item cases, and decided to open one. Though it'll be another day before I can open one. 

So then she sends me this back 
""Hey im also new to this &amp; im trying to get this off my list so you can resell.im having ebay contact me""

and another

""
hey! I am sooo sorry for holding you up.i just started too &amp; lesson learned for sure.so ebay contacted me &amp; this is how you cancel.they are really great so if you need extra help have them contact you.again sorry

1.Go to Sold under My eBay.

2.Select the item you’d like to cancel.

3.Under the More actions dropdown menu, click Cancel order.

4.Select your reason for canceling this order from the list and click Continue.

5.Review the refund retails and click Send refund.
Thank You!""

My reply:
""Hi, Unfortunately since you were the winning bidder you're obligated to pay for the item you've bid on. Simply canceling the the auction will net me nothing in return. If I pursue an unpaid item case ebay will at least give me a credit for my time.""


Her Reply:
""Huh? I contacted them and explained everything.there the ones that understood im new and sent instructions for me to send to you to cancel.follow the instructions so you can sell your item""

She then followed up with this:
""Hey i talked to them again.you will actually recieve the final value fee credit when you send me the cancellation and i accept it.if you have questions call them.its will be ok""

Given it hasn't even been 4 days yet, and I haven't been able to contact them. I'm having a hard time trusting her. So my plan is to just wait out the unpaid item case and talk to ebay directly. 

Anyone else been in this situation?

Ebay,Needing a return label to send an item back but the seller is not responding,"Quick back story-- I've been an ebay member since 2002 and have never had any problems. I ordered something from another country a little less than a month ago and it turned out to be a knock off of what I thought I was getting (and what was advertised) and in a much larger size than advertised. I wrote the seller telling them all of this and they were super rude to me and said they knew it was a real product. When I got the product inspected and wrote them back very professionally, they said they would give me a refund online because it didn't fit me. They also told me they started the refund process.


So I got the first ebay message stating the refund process has begun. Then I go to the next step and press on the ""print address label."" It takes me to another page where it has the three steps-- starting the return, requesting a label, and sending the package by a certain date. It has the sellers address on there, and a button for me to request a return label.


I pressed the button for requesting a label and wrote back the person asking for a label. I haven't heard anything. What do I do next? eBay mentioned they will step in if the seller doesn't respond in 3 business days. It's been two business days and three days in general.

Ebay,"eBay experts, help! I think I'm being shaken down.","OK eBay gurus, I have a question for you. I sold my laptop a month ago on eBay. I installed a fresh (legitimate) copy of windows 8 prior to shipping and made sure it was in good working order. As I said, this item was sold a month ago. Now, the buyer has messaged me stating that the laptop I sold was riddled with malware. The buyer claims to have taken it to a repair shop and is requesting that I pay this bill (new installation of windows + labor by the computer shop.) I asked why, if the item wasn't up to her expectations, that she waited a month before contacting me. I haven't yet received an answer. I'd never try to rip anyone off, but after the item has been in use by a third party for a month, I don't feel obligated to pay a dime. If she had contacted me right away about the issue, I would have gladly taken the item back and refunded the buyer in full. However, I wasn't made aware of any issue for some time. I have no way of knowing how the computer became infected, and I certainly didn't have any say in the repair shop used. I sold the item as ""used"", and I didn't offer any kind of warranty or anything. I'm just not sure what to do from here. Like I said, if I had been notified right away, I'd have refunded and taken the item back. But after a month of use, and an unknown repair shop's tampering, I really don't want the laptop back, nor do I feel obligated to pay for ""repairs."" eBay gods, what do you think on the matter? Am I the victim of a buyer simply trying to pass off a cost onto me? Thanks!

Ebay,If you have a chance please confirm here that I'm just being paranoid with bid shilling.,"So I won several items off of ebay from the same seller. The bidding got a little crazy at the end. I just went back and took a look at the other bids and somethings just didnt look right

Hopefully its easy to see what Im seeing. There are two users that drove the price up Crazy high right at the end. Not really weird in itself because some people do that whole piece bidding thing because they are kinda crazy like that.

What is weird is that the accounts are

- Newish 

- have 100% bid-rate with that user

- and no bid retractions (another point that will be relevant later)


I also mentioned in another post that I had been given second chance offers on two other items this seller is selling.... within 5 minutes of the item closing. These same two names were the winners.

Ebay,Used once or twice =/=new without tags.,"I look at a lot of handbags on Ebay, and I notice that a lot of sellers seem to think that if they used something once or twice, that it's new. No. It's pre-owned, whether it was used once or a hundred times. New means never used.

Ebay,Possibility of this eBay business,"I had an idea for an eBay business, but there seems to be alot of competition.  
Basically, the competition comes down to:  
-Chinese sellers who have no substantiated reputation, but can sell items at the minimum price.  
-Reputable sellers on eBay based in America which are overpricing by alot.  
I'm trying to undercut the American sellers, but then how would buyers view my items and be able to find them without going page after page? I can't be low enough to compete with the Chinese; there just wouldn't be any profit left over. At the same time, the Chinese take 1 month to ship an item, and they have a reputation of having cheap shit, even if the items are originally coming from China.

Ebay,no reviews/ ratings from buyers after successful transaction/ delivery,"Hi all,

I don't really know if this is just a problem of the german ebay community but it starts to annoy the hell out of me.


I had a pretty active ebay account around 10 years ago with around 400 reviews (100% positive), back then people were pretty fast rating/ reviewing the buyer/ seller after successful transaction and delivery respectively.


Coming back to ebay after  -as said- around 10 years with a new account (lost email-info, password, etc of old account) things seem to have changed. I use my new account for selling only at the moment and I rarely get reviews/ ratings. 


I'm selling my record collection (vinyl) right now, all top notch stuff, mostly unplayed (mainly bought the records to collect and ""have it"").


The problem is: I think not having a lot of ratings/ reviews and having a new account keeps a lot of people from bidding ""higher"" or bidding at all. I've sold around 50 records so far (over 6 months) and got a total of 4 ratings out of it (which are all positive)....


The most weird things is: 3 buyers did even sent me an email via ebay after they got their package to tell me that everything is alrite and how happy they are to have that record in their own collection now...but I did not get reviews from those people.

I - as seller - review they buyers instantly after receiving the money.


Is there anything else I can do? Should I wait with reviewing as well? Or will that then be sort of everyone waiting for the other person to move first kind of game?",2.0,3,2015-01-28,EBAY,0.030065499246120453,0.9207218289375305,0.04921267181634903

Ebay,First time receiving the wrong item and asking for a refund. Questions about procedure.,"I recently purchased a Transformers (specifically Soundwave from TF: Prime) figure from a vendor.

I put in a ""Return Request"" as soon as I opened the package, including the image from the original ad and of the product I received, and was told to wait up to 48 hours for a response.

Ebay,I hate ebay. No one should ever sell with such a moronic company.,"I sold an AV receiver to a guy who claimed that it wasn't working. He filed a buyer protection thing with eBay. (I put no returns on my listings). eBay carte blanche ruled in his favor without listening to my side at all. AV receiver was in mint condition and working perfectly when I sent it. Anyway - I receive the item back today: completely damaged, plastic on front plate cracked, metal is warped like someone took a screwdriver to it, and the most important thing - IT WORKED. So everything he said to get his money back from eBay was a lie. So I call eBay to appeal: they take one minute and say there's nothing they can do - they are going to charge me for the item, and for shipping it both to him and back to myself. I tell them a) it's working so everything the guy said was false, b) the item returned is not in the condition I sent it, and c) I NEVER GUARANTEED ANYTHING to the buyer - it's a 10 year old receiver! It worked fine and looked great when I sent it. The eBay leadership team person told me after looking at the case for 1 minute: This is the cost of doing business, we can't accept proof that it works, we aren't ruling in your favor, you signed the agreement when you agreed to sell on ebay.

First of all that's bullshit because it's only a cost to me, not to eBay - they have no skin in the game, they have no incentive to rule in my favor. Maybe if eBay had to pay 50% of the cost, they'd look at the cases more carefully before just blanket ruling in the buyer's favor. Second, this is THEIR guarantee, not mine! I'm not Walmart, I'm not Best Buy. I'm not going to guarantee old shit I'm selling. I can't guarantee that the customer isn't a moron that doesn't know how to set up a receiver. With all the evidence stacked up against the buyer - the fact that the receiver works which negates his initial claim anyway - how does a seller get an appeal to work in their favor?? I mean if that's not enough, WHAT IS? Lastly, my receiver is cosmetically busted up, which is not the condition I sent it in, so not only do I have to pay for my item and shipping both ways, I get an item that's damaged?

Where's the justice? Where is your moral compass? I'm going to repeat my story to on facebook, twitter, instagram, and everyone I talk to about how AWFUL selling on ebay is. You let buyers take advantage of sellers because you have no skin in the game, zero incentive to actually do some due diligence and investigate who is in the right. That's why your policy favors the buyer 99% of the time - you don't have to pay for anything, so why would you investigate? If you actually had to share the costs with the seller with YOUR GUARANTEE (NOT THE SELLER'S), then you may actually have an incentive to make sure frauds aren't being perpetrated against both you and the seller.

Ebay,RANT: horrible buyers on ebay,"i must say that i ship almost everyday and try my best with describing everything accurately and to my best ability but this one woman on eBay who bought foundation sample from me complained and left negative feedback because there was enough to cover her face... nothing to do with shipping. I described everything and in no way misrepresented anything. I had another customer buy the same foundation sample but in a different shade and I had no problems with her. She left negative feedback over $4.50 (including shipping) and because she didn't read the description. Ugh i just really hate ebay sometimes. I refunded her after she agreed to revise feedback if I did. She didn't respond to the feedback request.. This is over $4.50 people...honestly. 

Sometimes I want to leave because the fees are too high, the buyers are ridiculous but there's great traffic to my products...in other news..does anyone know another place I can sell my stuff? I sell early 20s women's clothes, shoes and accessories. Most of its new or worn at most 5 times. Just looking to clear my wardrobe!

Ebay,Alibaba trade assurance?,"Any personal experience with a seller on Alibaba whose payment terms are ONLY L/C, T/T, but have Trade Assurance? I am on the fence about an order because the seller does not accept Paypal (heard this is a red flag). 

But Trade Assurance states ""100% refund of the Trade Assurance Amount for orders not meeting agreed delivery and quality terms contained in the contract.""

(http://tradeassurance.alibaba.com)

The seller covers up to $20,000 in trade assurance while my order is only a couple thousand. I've already taken the precaution of paying partial (half) then full when I receive the item and am satisfied. They were not willing to send a sample either, though their MOQ was very high (1000).

Ebay,Sold Gift Card on Ebay - Worried About Buyer Scam - What Can I Do to Project Myself?,"Hello! I recently sold a 100 dollar gift card on ebay, and I'm worried this buyer is going to be a scammer. They made their account the day they bought my card, and are paying with an ""eCheck"" (so I have a some time until the money processes to protect myself against this potential scammer).

I know selling gift cards on ebay can be risky, so other than not do it again, what can I do to protect myself here? I'm thinking definitely signature confirmation, but would insurance on the package do anything for me? How to I protect myself from this person potentially filing a complaint claiming there is no money on the card, when there is! 

I'm not emailing him the card number or anything, I'm sending him the physical card, and I'm also going to send him a COPY of the store receipt showing the balance on the card and that it was activated.

Ebay,Question regarding shipping as a seller.,"Hello r/ebay, I recently started selling items on Ebay and have required the buyer to pay for the shipping. I have noticed however that the shipping cost is coming out of my personal bank account to print the labels. I currently have two items that the cash is pending to be transferred to my paypal account. I was wondering if I will be reimbursed the amount for shipping once the item arrives? If not how do I go about making sure the item's shipping cost is charged to the buyer in future, and not me as the seller?",2.0,3,2015-01-29,EBAY,0.05081857368350029,0.923797607421875,0.025383781641721725
Ebay,INAD extortion and re-requesting partial refund?,"I sold an item and the guy is complaining the item is not as described.  He submitted a return/partial refund request and I replied with a partial refund offer less than what he was expecting.  He then closed the offer and opened a case with eBay.  I told him if he re-submitted a partial refund offer, I would accept at the value he asked for.  He's claiming that... well, I'm not sure what he's claiming.  Here's the message:

""I appreciate it. I can't open another request until this one is closed.  If you send a refund manually I can close this out.""

And after I told him there's nothing I can do until he resubmits a new refund request, he replies

""I can close it. I think there's nothing you can do from your end. If you're able to go to your paypal account and go to my transaction, you can select to offer a partial refund. If you are able to do that I can close the case from my end.""

I'm not terribly familiar with eBay but this feels super sketchy now.  This is incredibly frustrating as the item was exactly as described and this stuff only started occurring after I left positive feedback.  (I can't revise feedback as I almost never use eBay, and probably never will again.)

EDIT (added second message): All I want the guy to do is close the case with eBay and resubmit a refund request, which I will then fulfill so he shuts up and goes away.  It might also be worth noting that immediately upon receiving the item, he posted it for auction.  I didn't get messages about INAD until a few days later, and a day after I left feedback.

What do I do?",5.0,3,2015-01-29,EBAY,0.07332966476678848,0.8952451348304749,0.03142523393034935
Ebay,Another seller stealing our photos with watermark and Ebay does nothing,"This started 2 weeks ago, I found another seller listing an item using our photo with OUR WATERMARK in the photo. 
I messaged to remove the photo, his response ""Alright"".

He didn't remove the photo, since it was an auction and he couldn't change the photo without ending the auction. I reported the item obviously and called ebay 4 times in one week. 
Each representative told me they they would escalate it. 

Each day I check the listing is still there. The last time I called was the day the listing was supposed to end. I was assured that even if the listing ends without action being taken, they would still flag his account for stealing other people's photos. 

Well today I found he listed another item using our picture with our watermark, so clearly ebay still has done nothing.

I have already reported the new listing and messaged him again to remove it. 

I will call ebay later when they open, but I want to make sure this listing gets removed.

Ebay,USPS package mysteriously re-directed to a bogus address,"Very long. Going to try to make this as short as possible.

Buyer bought item 1/24, Sat. I shipped package out 1/26, Monday.  Package was USPS 3-Day Priority. ""Expected"" to arrive 1/29. Package got sent to Kent, WA postal facility the night of 1/26. Haven't seen an update since.

Buyer frantically messages me all day long trying to find out the whereabouts of this package, to the point where she provided me with her cell to text her. I obliged - though I have a life, a kid, girl scout meetings, a job - stayed on the phone w/ USPS all day during work breaks and after trying to figure out what happened.

USPS Call center says package was redirected to ""___ Street"" midnight on the 27th. And again on the 29th. No house number given, just ___ Street. She said it sounds like fraud but since there was no house number given, it doesn't really make sense. Every person I talked to (4 total, 2 USPS cust. serv. reps and 2 postal workers at the facility it's supposedly at in CA) is baffled. 

I have 100% pos. feedback. I buy half the time, sell half the time. Don't want my rep. tarnished - but also don't know what to do because buyer seems to want to open up a complaint tomorrow if it's not received - I say give it more time.. I'm a buyer. Ish happens.. wait a few days, right? I offered to have the package intercepted to customer's post office w/ signature confirmation and HOPEFULLY it'll end up there. This however, costs $11.50 which I have to pay for. I wouldn't mind except now I'm reading about people frauding, having packages re-directed to cause havoc and blame sellers, get their money back, etc... I don't know what to do. What do I do? I want to appease customer, just wish she'd chill out a bit and wait but how is the package mysteriously getting re-directed? Customer said it's because the last 4 of her zip code are 4700 and on the insurance receipt, it shows 4702, but I wrote her entire address correct and address is not on ___ Street, however customer says this street is coincidentally near her. USPS says the last 4 digits would not affect this or cause this to happen whatsoever. What's going on? I'm so lost.

PS - Customer has 199 people giving her 100% positive feedback.

Ebay,"Yet another ""Ebay Alternatiave"" Question, lol. Here is my problem though","Thank you guys for reading and taking the time to answer this question.

I may be doing something wrong, but it seems that I do everything that people have told me to do. I optimize the title to fit keywords, I optimize it for the ""best match"" feature, I list a bunch of items to increase the chance of sales, etc, etc ""Golden Ebay Rules"", etc.

I can't seem to get views at all, the least I'll get is maybe 4 to 5 views on each item, and it's crazy because, Ebay is supposed to have all of this traffic (which it does) but I can't seem to get any views even though I believe I'm doing everything right

Which brings me to my questions: Which ebay alternative site have you had success on? Which one is the best in your opinion? Has anyone else been having the problems I'm having?

I'll still stick with ebay for now (I think), but eventually I would like to branch out to another platform.

Ebay,"Yet another ""buyer says item not delivered"" story...","Sold an iPhone on eBay. I knew immediately it might be an annoying sale, because after he won the auction, he said he wouldn't pay me until I unlocked the phone to work on another carrier. Well, that was simple, so I did it as a courtesy (even if I think he should have been the one to do it; whatever).

Anyway, I shipped it, and USPS marks it as delivered, but he said he didn't actually get it. I advised him to contact USPS and/or file a claim with them. He said he couldn't, and asked me to (huh?). I did, but USPS maintains they delivered the package.

I once again advised him to contact the post office. Now he says he can't because he doesn't live in the US and uses a proxy to buy things from the US. Great. I specifically marked the listing as US-only, but he managed to get around that.

I'm not actually convinced he's scamming me, though it's a possibility. The delivery message from USPS shows that it was delivered to a different ZIP code than his address. He also has good feedback.

While writing this, he opened a claim with eBay. What should I do? If this is all legitimate, I feel bad for the guy, but it's clearly not my fault, and I feel like I've gone above and beyond what was expected of me (opening a claim on his behalf, unlocking the phone at his request, and I even threw in a couple extras not in the listing).

Ebay,"New seller, can't tell if I'm the difficult one or the customer is","I'm totally new to eBay as a seller and am just offloading stuff to begin my new life after leaving a bad domestic situation, so I'm not really knowledgeable about the proper etiquette here. A potential buyer has contacted me to say they're interested in the stuff I'm selling, but instead of buying it, can I send them a list of future things I might list so they can go ahead and pick what they want without me having to list it. They also want me to use a shipping method that is really inconvenient for me. They say this will make shipping cheaper, but I don't think the math will work out that way. He's making a big deal out of bypassing eBay, which seems really fishy to me. 

I've been getting messages from this buyer every few hours for a week or so now. They also lowballed some offers that I accepted but have not paid for them. Their messages have indicated they do not wish to pay full price for anything. 

So since I'm new to eBay I can't tell -- is this normal for a buyer? Am I being difficult by not wanting to catalogue all the stuff I'm eventually going to put up, send it to this person privately so they can take their pick with lowball offers and alternative but inconvenient shipping?
