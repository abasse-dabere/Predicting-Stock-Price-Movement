Ebay,"What's wrong with ebay? Buyer purchased an item, tried to cancel after it was shipped, and then filed a wrong item claim for an item that wasn't wrong.","I've been selling on ebay going on 3 years now and this is the first issue I've had with ebay, though I'm thinking it will be the last as I'm seriously considering not selling here anymore after this fiasco. 

I sold a $1700 item to someone a couple of weeks back. Immediately after I shipped the item, I received a message from the buyer asking to cancel. I kindly told him that it was too late and if he would like to return it, there would be a restocking fee. He balked at the restocking fee and then didn't say anything for a week. The item was delivered and the buyer immediately opened a claim for a wrong item. The buyer claimed that the item I sent him was supposed have different hookups (it wasn't, it's very clear in the listing &amp; details) and was obviously an attempt to circumvent paying a restocking fee.

I called ebay to explain that the buyer was abusing the wrong item claim. The customer service rep made notes, opened a claim, and agreed that it sounded like a case of buyer's remorse and that they would require the buyer to get their own label and ship back the item, at which point I would be able to take my restocking fee via paypal and they would note it as closed. However, I received a resolution that said ebay sided with the buyer, and now it appears I'm on the hook for the shipping label.

How does this make sense and has this happened to anyone else?

tl;dr - I'm going to end up paying $40+ for no apparent reason just to have shipped the correct item to someone and now to get it back. What's wrong with ebay?",12,8,2018-02-01,EBAY,0.1674380600452423,0.8053221702575684,0.02723979391157627
Ebay,How to best handle an item not as described as a buyer?,"So, I recently ordered a toy(listed as new, desc said opened to do a youtube review then put back in the box) , paid, tracking provided, but it never updated.  Eventually after some emails back and forth, about why the tracking never updated, he claims there was post office issues and he is shipping it again via ups instead, including a pic of the label for the tracking number.

Eventually, the item arrives (now about 20some days since I ordered it) and it is missing a few small, but somewhat critical parts.  Seller said they would look for them when I messaged them but I'm not hopeful.

I guess I'm curious what would be fair to ask of the seller? Should i ask for a few bucks back to make up for the missing parts that I'll have to source or deal without? The biggest annoyance of mine is that if I return it, as far as shipping costs go, I may have well spent another 30 bucks and buy one that actually claims to be sealed.

Ebay,HELP! Ebay Minimum Price Guarantee,"Hi guys, I am being tortured by ebay and they are not paying me the minimum price guarantee. I have called them at least 12 times each time more than an hour on the phone. The promised price as per the ebay website was ($153.14) and my listing sold for $112.50. So I am supposed to receive the difference ( $40.64) + a $20 coupon as per promotion. I have proof of all this including screenshots and documents of listing. I called them before shipping out the item to confirm if I will be getting the price difference + a $20 coupon and they confirmed, yes I am eligible for this. It has been two months and I still havent received my money back from them. The best they have offered me is $20 coupon and said we are sorry. Apparently the reason why I am not being given the coupon is under my description I said ""This item has some scratches, chips, and/or dents."" which is what the page where I listed on suggested I put the condition as. Also the rep whom I called on the day of the sale reviewed my listing and said everything looked good and I am eligible for this promotion. So both ways it is their fault.

Here are screenshots of both my listing proces, how they define their good condition and the terms and conditions I got in the email: https://imgur.com/a/jPcGu

Ebay,How have your sales been the past week?,"Wondering how your sales have been since the recent changes about a week back. The changes to my knowledge were moving the promotion banner to the bottom of the listing page and removing watcher count for buyers/potential buyers. 

On my end sales have dropped by a significant amount (roughly 70%), promotional sales have essentially dried up where as I used to get at least a few each day. The majority of my sales that past few days have been buyers who purchased before the changes took place. 

I'm not sure if anything else was changed but I have noticed a sharp decline in new buyers as well. The decline started on the 26th and has remained very low ever since.

Ebay,"Experienced eBayer - Problem with my sold listings being in my unsold list, and then being relisted.","I just had an issue relisting my unsolds, which i normally do everyday since I have many listings. Today it said i had 200 unsolds, and I chose the box to select all and relisted all 200.

I noticed 72 items were relisted that I have sold recently. Some were listing in duplicates, triplicates, and quad(licates). One I also saw I had qty 2 of an item, sold 1, the second went unsold, relisted, and sold that one. Then in the relisting I saw two listings, and one had qty 2 and the other had qty 1. Other issues were I had 1 of an item and it turned around and listed 2 separate qty 1 listings of the sold item.

I talked to 5 people on ebay and they had no clue. I go in my unsolds now, which is usually empty, to see 3,226 unsold items in the list. I am usually only around 1,300-1,400 active listings, so its unsold listings for multiple months showing up. All ebay could say was that I had automatic listings on by accident, which isnt the case because I am relisitng the items the same way everyday for the last 4 years. I answered them by saying, then why is a qty 1 listing that sells showing back up in my unsolds? An item that never was relisted, so it couldn't have a different item number for the listing.

Ebay,Help with crazy dispute with buyer who broke my item after paying for it and leaving my residence,"Hi, sorry for the long post, but I have a question regarding a recent sale through eBay and a dispute made through PayPal that seems to be getting a bit out of control. 

A lady messaged me about a 2nd hand glass cabinet I was selling for local pick up with no refunds. I uploaded a picture of the cabinet, I said it was in great condition and specified the dimensions. Due to its age and being 2nd hand passed on from person to person, you can expect a certain amount of minor wear and tear, but there is no damage in the form of dents, scratches or broken parts whatsoever. 

After a few messages back and forth, she mentions that she is a single mother and asks if someone will be able to help her load up the cabinet with her. I say yes, I will be able to help her. She also mentions that she lives over an hour away and asks if I can hold onto it for her for a week as she will be my way then picking up other large items she had bought. I accept and ask if she could put a deposit on this for holding onto it for her, and she can pay the rest in cash on pick up. She accepts my request of putting a deposit on it to hold it for her. She decides to pay in full through PayPal 5 days in advance for me to be available for her to pick up Friday morning at an unknown time at this point. She said she would message me when she was on her way. 

Due to her committing to buying on ebay and having already paid, I had turned down other offers and requests through other sites. Ebay also specifically states “Once you have committed to buy an item on eBay you are contractually obliged to pay for it.“ right underneath the “buy it now” button. So this was locked in, paid for, a date was organised and that was that. 

Come pick up day, she arrives with a trailer with another item she had already picked up. She now notices that I live in an apartment building (my address I had provided should have given this away) up one set of stairs. She asks me to carry her trolley for her, so I do. She walks into my unit, quickly inspects the cabinet and points out that it only needs a quick clean and that it is not damaged. After this, she is quick to drag it along my wooden floorboards to my front door. I offer to help, but she says not to worry and asks that I just hold the door as she drags it out. Outside of my unit, she continues to drag it along the carpe. When a couple meters from my front door, she puts it on her trolley to get it to the top of the stairs another 10 or so meters away. At this point, she notices that one of the legs has broken and come loose. This would have been caused from her dragging the cabinet along the carpet outside of my unit as there was no issue with it even when dragging it along the wooden floorboards. The legs would not be be able to withstand the weight of the cabinet and the grip of the carpet whilst being dragged. I mention that there was no issue with this leg prior to her coming and dragging it.

She continues to point out the broken leg and now brings up that she doesn’t feel comfortable getting this down the stairs. I say that’s fine and knock on a few doors to see if anyone was home to assist us in getting the cabinet down the stairs. As it was 10 am on a Friday morning, everyone had already left for work. She continues to point out the leg and asks why I expected her to be able to carry this down. I did not push her to try and get this down, I suggested a couple of different ways we could try with myself taking the weight as I go down backwards. ( I would like to point out that it was myself and a 60 year old woman who got it up the stairs originally without any issues) Of course everyone is different and I’m not going to try and make someone do something like this if they are not comfortable, but you wouldn’t assume the person picking up an item like this was unable to carry and lift it into a trailer if they could not carry the trolley, just as much as the buyer asks why I would assume that she is capable of doing this without having prior knowledge that she is not capable of doing so. So I ask what she would like to do and she says she cannot take it and helps to get it back inside and asks for a refund. She says she will contact paypal and get back to me, and I said I will contact ebay and we can go from there. 

Ebay tells me they will back me up, but I have to wait until she disputes it before they can do anything. She messages me (all messaging through ebay) that night telling me that I can just send the money to her directly through paypal and leave it at that. Before even giving me the chance to reply, she had filed a dispute which was escalated first thing the following morning stating that she did not receive the item. I was out with my parents when she had messaged the night before, and I was not able to check the messages until the next morning when I had noticed that there was now a dispute/claim against me.

I message her saying that I am willing to give her a refund if we can come to an agreement to an amount to be deducted from the refund due to being left with something she has broken outside of my unit, and my inconvenience of having to have turned down other potential buyers, otherwise she is welcome to come back to collect it. 

She starts saying that I should not have expected that a “51 year old with weak back” to carry it or get it down the stairs. At the same time, I would have expected that if you’re a 51 year old with a weak back, you would have brought somebody along to help carry and lift it into the trailer for you on your behalf, otherwise mention it prior to buying it when you know it’s a larger item, and then I could have organised for somebody to help me get it downstairs into the garage before arrival. 

She also starts to say that the item was not as described and has scratches and other damage that wasn’t mentioned. There is no damage to this item, but I can certainly understand that everybody’s definition and expectation of the condition of a used item can vary as I think that minor wear and tear for an aged item like this is pretty good, but she is making it out to be major damage. She had the option to not pay for it earlier, and decide to inspect and decide on purchasing this on the day, with the risk of the item being sold before she could come over.

As this was all through ebay messaging, she continues to say things like “I was encouraging her to jeopardise her safety and wellbeing by getting her to carry it after she had already decided to quickly drag it out of my unit and get it to the stairs, and is also saying that the leg was already broken before her arrival.

She mentions that she has spoken to ebay and paypal and does not want to communicate with me further and let ebay and paypal sort this out. I get in contact with a supervisor at Paypal and they say that they have closed the case in my favour as there is no buyers protection and have left the money in my account. The buyer has since messaged me again saying she knows someone in my area that can fix the leg of the cabinet for free if I refund her the full amount, otherwise she will continue to appeal this with ebay and paypal, and even take this to tribunal and my building’s body corporate. 

This is getting ridiculous, but leads me to why I am posting this. Has anybody else had any experience with something like this? What should I do? Do I need to be concerned about her threatening to continue to fight this with ebay, paypal and even contact the body corporate and tribunal? Should I just refund the money and be done with it, or at least try and get some money back on the broken leg and the fact the inconvenience on turning down other buyers. In the end, Paypal has closed the case in my favour, and I am willing to allow her to pick up the item still as she has been contractually obligated through ebay to pick it up after having committed to buying it and paying for it. I will also have the leg fixed and brought downstairs prior to her arrival if she wishes.

I will be happy to provide any other information if needed.

Ebay,How should I resolve this case ! Please help !,"Basically I bought headphones, after a week they stopped working, brought them into Apple Store to see what the issue was, they said it's probably a battery issue since beats batteries last 2 years, I figured it'd be cheaper to repair them than to buy a whole new pair so I gave it to them

2 weeks later they gave it back saying it's not real/has been modified so no repairs were done, under further inspection I learned from the Apple Store that the headphones were from 2015 but the box was a 2017 model box, also the serial numbers didn't match 

I labeled the pictures from 1-8 and provided proof images, what should I do (I'm the buyer) thank you ! 

Should I just say screw him and ask eBay to step in?

Ebay,Item I sold arriving a day late due to UPS. Buyer wants to return and get a refund. What can I do?,"Hi guys, hope someone can provide some advice if possible.

I’m from the UK and sold to someone in the UK.

I sold a brand new iPhone X, the buyer paid for the item promptly and I posted it via UPS (through eBay’s shuttle service). The item was due to arrive on this Friday just gone, unfortunately for whatever reason, UPS didn’t deliver it and the tracking now says it will be delivered this coming Monday, so 1 business day late.

The buyer, in my opinion, is being unreasonable and says he won’t be around to accept delivery. He says UPS will return it for me and has therefore submitted a refund request.

I’ve said to him to let me know what day/time suits him and that I’m happy to contact UPS to arrange a suitable delivery time on his behalf. I also apologised for the delivery being late and, although out of my hands, offered a full refund on the postage for good will.

Who will eBay side with on this one from your experience?

I’m also a little sceptical and worried he may try and pull a fast one and take the item but then dispute he hasn’t taken it. But then it’s a UPS tracked, signed delivery so maybe I’m over-worrying.

Ebay,I just re-registered on ebay and got suspended the second day,"I had an ebay account, but never used for many years. Last year I received an email saying that my account has suspicious activity so I decided to deactivate my account since I don't use it at all, and never bought anything on that account.

However I really wanted it so I re-registered my account and wanted to contact that seller to make an arrangement but turns out that seller cannot be contacted so I gave up.

Ebay,New crooked practice found on eBay - Sales tax inflation,"I sell a lot on eBay and also often buy shipping boxes there.  One bundle of boxes was $33.10 with free shipping.  This seemed to be the best price so I added it to my cart.  The total came to $42.39.  The difference was because I was charged $8.48 for sales tax.  This is 25% of the price of the item.  In my area, the sales tax is 7.25% and the county with the highest tax rate in my state charges 8.5%.  I tried reporting the listing to eBay, however none of their reasons seem to fit this particular issue.  Overcharging for sales tax is also likely illegal in whichever state this seller operates out of, which they don't disclose.

Ebay,PayPal only verifies ZIPCODE not address for delivery confirmation,"Long story short.

Ordered something on eBay for $1200. Didn’t receive item. Seemed fishy. Contacted PayPal to file a claim and they suggested file with my cc instead to get a better chance.

Seller sent tracking number which said it was shipped and delivered and signed for.

I contacted USPS and requested proof of delivery. When I got it, it was for a different address, but same zip, signed for by another name.

PayPal contacted my cc stating that the tracking info is sufficient and is valid proof - yet it only includes TOWN AND ZIP. Not house number.

Credit card has closed my case stating the seller has sufficient proof !!  WTF.

I sent the proof of delivery with the receiving address shown as NOT MY ADDRESS, yet they still claim the seller has provided proof.

Ebay,Buyer Lied To Avoid My Restocking Fee... Anything I Can Do?,"So I recently sold an item (A riser for motorcycle handlebars) which I stated in the description were for 1"" handlebars (which was direct information from my supplier).

So when the buyer received the item and told me he had received the wrong product I just believed him (he stated that the product he received were for 1-1/4"" handlebars) and assumed my supplier sent me the wrong item in the box. 

Well I just got the item back today, and turns out it was the exact one I thought I sent out. Measurements are exact and not what the buyer stated. I called eBay to see what to do, and got a very sassy answer from the rep:

""Sir, I just don't understand your problem, you got the original item back, correct?"" 

""Yes I did, but he opened an INAD case against me when the product is described correctly, I even included the photos in the case. They should have had to pay return shipping and my restocking fee.""

""I'm sorry, but if you accepted the return, and the item was received today you need to refund the buyer in a timely manner. Is that all you needed today?""

I'm not very confrontational so I didn't push this very far. Is this worth escalating or trying to get another rep on the phone? Or should I just put this past me? I'd like to hear if anyone has had any luck with similar cases and how they did it.

Ebay,Buyer poorly packaged a return and it was damaged in shipping,I sold a working PS3 to a customers. He got it just fine and even left positive feedback.

Posted on eBay reddit and PayPal reddit. Decided to continue pursuing a PayPal appeal before getting a lawyer since that would be more costly.

I filed a local police report, USPIS report, FBI report and submitted all of that plus pictures, eBay information, tracking numbers, everything I had. PayPal went silent for a week once I started the appeal. 

Then after a week I got an email saying my fax didn’t have enough information. I never sent a fax though. Tried calling them...could never get through. Decided to reach out to them on twitter asking about the fax. They never responded to that but apologized for the delay and said they were escalating to a specialist now. 

This morning I woke up to an email saying PayPal is issuing me a refund. This is their final decision and cannot be appealed by the buyer.

I will still be pushing law enforcement to engage in his fraud/attempted fraud. Hopefully this can still help the other guy that got scammed by him too. 

Now I wait for what this buyer will do next... but for now I won a PayPal case despite their infamous record and I feel okay.

All these messages of course have to be deciphered as they are full of spelling and grammar issues. I stayed VERY professional with him throughout all of it, believe me it was difficult to. Anyways, trying to cover myself I tell him that once I leave the post office I was done with the phone. I didn't follow his envelope request because I knew he was hoping to get it broken so I have it packaged extremely well with insurance. 
He gets it, day later return request. Big surprise isnt it? Well his reason for the return is ""battery dies at 30% I was told it held a charge"". So does it hold a charge or does it die at 30%? Anyways I argue with him about it, again very professionally. He's just saying I give him a full refund and pay for his shipping or I give him $50 and he'll keep it. I of course refused both and waited till today and called ebay before he had the chance to escalate the case to them himself. The guy on the phone took a look at a portion of all of these messages (39 recieved in total) told me that he was trying to do a ""remorse return"", released my funds back to me, and recommended I blocked him.
So there you go folks, you do your research, learn how the site works, act very professionally, and CALL eBay you got a pretty darn good shot at winning your case.",14,16,2018-02-07,EBAY,0.0389142706990242,0.9229779839515686,0.03810775279998779

Ebay,"Am I in the wrong as the buyer in this case or is the international Chinese seller in the wrong? Long post, so sorry.","The listing was for an electronic item, but there are two types. One is to connect IDE hard drives to the computer that takes IDE hard drives only. The other is an adapter to connect newer SATA drives to the older computers that takes only IDE. The sellers listing mentioned ""SATA IDE Adapter"" and the listing itself had no drop down menu to pick which one you wanted, it was just the item as per the listing.

So I bought it expecting the SATA adapter to connect the IDE drives to older IDE only computers. But after $300 and 20 days of shipping, I got the IDE only version. I check the listing again and sure enough ""SATA IDE Adpater"" but the last picture in the series of vague stock images that dont show if its SATA or IDE, there is a picture showing its actually IDE and in the ""product details"" with all the prefilled information, not to be confused with the item description area you type out yourself. 

Since the listing wasnt them selling both, and having me pick the item I want specifically though a drop down menu, I assumed based off the listing title it was the SATA version to adapt SATA drives to IDE only devices, hence why they used ""SATA IDE Adapter"" If they were ONLY selling straight IDE versions, then there is absolutely NO reason at all to ever use ""SATA"" anywhere under any circumstance. However thats what they did, name dropping ""SATA"" many times. 

It wouldnt make sense to advertise EUROPEAN USA PHONE PLUG OUTLET ADAPTER for people flying to europe with their american plugs and discover the items they bought were regular american plugs instead of adapters to convert american to european outlets, right?

So I file a return/refund case and tell them their listing was highly misleading and deceptive and that all my time was wasted waiting for the wrong thing because of a misleading lying listing etc etc. I suggest they fix the mistakes in their listing, and that I assume it was unintentional and things must have been lost in translation due to a language barrier. 

They didnt dispute it, they said sorry and kept offering I keep the items and resell them and that they would give me a 20% partial refund as compensation. I said I dont want to keep them, its not fair to them, and that a partial refund wasnt fair to me and I want a full refund. This goes back and forth with them offering I keep item but the refund goes from 20% to 30% all the way to 55%. I decline again and they offer a flat $30. Lol. I decline and they said ok full refund after they get the product back. I say ok, sure, provide the proper international shipping labels and customs documentation and I will gladly ship them back and wait weeks for my refund.

They say no it will cost them too much, I have to pay it myself, then get the shipping refunded and the initial money I paid for the items refunded as well.

I tell them no because the FedEx, USPS, and UPS shipping calculators and quotes all say to send the items back would cost me an estimated $150 (average between the 3) and I dont have the money to do that since its 3 packages, it would be $450 total for me.

Screw that.

Tomorrow Ebay steps in. What are my chances? How about with Paypal?

It was 3 packages, each from a different account but from the same location address and sender name from China so the same seller using 3 accounts.

I know I should have been more careful in reading the listing but after they plastered ""SATA"" all over the title, and using the same stock picture to basically hide the last picture and with no reason to use ""SATA"" for an IDE only item I think its reasonable a person would assume its SATA adapter they were buying.

Worse yet, after waiting 20 days, I discover I need a few more so I buy again from one of the sellers. Then later the next day I get the original I ordered and thats when I discover they were IDE not SATA and so I will have to open ANOTHER case against one of the same sellers for the same reason to get my money.

Ebay,Hey guys I have a Seller question regarding shipping pricing with my eBay account,"I have sold about 50 things in the past few years. I have never offered free shipping- all of my buyers have paid the shipping fee along with the item price.  
Well I’ve sold 3 things in the past month. 

Each time I purchased the shipping label, eBay/PayPal automatically refunded my buyer if there was a difference between what they paid for shipping fee and how much the shipping label actually costed for me. This has only happened in my last three sales. 

Is this new? I never get refunded a difference if there is one for the price I pay for shipping for an item and how much the shipping label actually costs when I purchase items on eBay. And I purchase items daily. 

So why the heck is my account doing this? Is there a way to fix it? I’ve tried googling and have found nothing. 

My paypal/eBay account has even refunded for differences under 50 cents...

I think it’s okay to keep the extra cents in regards to shipping &amp; “handling.”

Ebay,"Hey sellers, watch out for Russia","I sold an iPhone to Russia recently, one that was almost new. The buyer paid in a timely manner, and likewise I shipped promptly. The phone was in excellent condition, less than 6 months old, and I even had video proof that it worked and I had packaged it well. I paid extra out of pocket for traceable shipping and it was delivered to the buyer. 

The buyer claimed it didn’t work. eBay sided with the buyer and said I had to accept a return. I sent a FedEx label for the return but the buyer just kept messaging me insisting I send him money directly for various reasons (and using lots of hyperbole and exclamation points). eBay actually refunded the buyer and charged my paypal account. After many phone calls (over the course of 2 weeks) to eBay I finally was able to get them to reverse the decision and give me my money back but it took a lot of patience and persuasion. 

I’ve been a low volume seller for 20 years, I sell mostly personal items I want to get rid of and I’ve sold internationally before without a problem. I have a perfect reputation on eBay with no negative items. This experience definitely has made me rethink whether selling on eBay is worth it at all and especially not internationally. Mostly I wanted to share the story because similar stories helped me when I was researching whether to ship the phone to begin with. Based on what I read, I thought eBay would more readily have my back as a seller if I did everything correctly, but they were not at all on my side despite it being an obvious case of fraud by the buyer. 

TLDR: It’s not a good idea to ship expensive items to Russia. There’s a lot of potential for headache on the back end of the sale.",38,15,2018-02-09,EBAY,0.029504263773560524,0.9234369993209839,0.04705873876810074
Ebay,Being scammed by a buyer eBay wont help,"So, I sold a laptop here on eBay and a week after the buyer messages me saying there's something wrong with it. I give many solutions to fix it but they keep saying the problem is still there. I knew this laptop had no problems. Later a return request was made and as a good seller, I accepted immediately and provided a label. When I got it back this laptop is a different model, it won't charge, keyboard is broken and screen is a different resolution. This guy even went so far as to swapping the back cover that shows the serial number for the one I sent. I messaged the buyer about this but no response. I called eBay and they told me they won't cover my issue since they consider it a ""business loss"". I filed a police report, mail fraud, and ic3 report. Later the fraudster actually responded denying committing fraud. I have pictures, videos before I sent it and the product I got back. eBay once again keeps saying the same Bullsh*t. They don't even try to look at my evidence. It's basically supporting fraud. So do you guys know what else I can do?

EDIT: So after calling 27+ times I finally got a supervisor willing to help. I quoted them on their policies. This broken laptop I got is still worth about $200 so I got a $600 refund from eBay.

What can I do?","[This was my previous post regarding the issue] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/7kafj9/need_help_with_a_buyer_i_sold_him_a_keyboard_that/).

In short, I sold a keyboard that had faulty backlighting that I had lying around.  The buyer received it, brought it to a shop to try and fix it, then demanded essentially a full refund while he kept the keyboard because of an error in the listing (it was not fixable).   

I accepted that it was my fault (I thought the issue was easily fixable and listed it as such), tried to offer him a full refund and paid return shipping, but he declined and threatened to give me negative feedback if I refused to let him keep it because he ""would be out a lot for repair costs."" I refused, he left negative, and I thought that was the end of that.

Two months later, I randomly get a request on eBay for a return on it.  It's been two months and he has admitted to trying all types of things to try and 'fix' it, so I said I could not accept a return.

He has now filed a Paypal dispute. Here is what he has listed:

&gt;Give me my money back and I will have to suffer the loss of the money I spent trying to get it fixed.My next step will be to file in small claims court.... We have a company lawyer so it won't cost me anything but the additional court costs would become your responsibility.

I really have no idea what I can do.  Am I in the wrong?  I don't even need the money (It's only $50), but the way this buyer is acting has got me truly at a loss for words. Should I go through with taking back the keyboard? Or just ignore it?

Ebay,Fake designer items on eBay and (lack of) eBay's policy about it (UK),"So recently my sister was shopping for a handbag and found a nice bag (Coach) for around $(USD)400, in a department store. I tried to persuade her that there are better things to buy with $400, but she was set on a new handbag. I then took out my phone and found a similar bag for around $200 on eBay (new without tags). Great! My sister could save $200, I thought.

Long story short - Ordered the bag, and it was a counterfeit!

Now it was decent quality, and we were all fooled at first. But the materials just did't feel quite right (there were inconsistent leather quality and the zipper wasn't as smooth as $400 bag...) So I went to conduct a through internet research and wasted several hours reading about it. I even found a site that sells fake bags for around $80 (the seller seems to have same models as this site have). Now the site obviously claims to sell ""high quality Coach products, directly made of Coach official manufactory."" (http://www.dabbawalahk.com/). So it may, or may not be fake ;)

So the main evidence that I have on the bag being fake is that the inside leather tag does not match the official Coach formatting. Obviously I can't prove based on leather quality from a picture, but trust me it feels funny.

So I called eBay with the evidence and eBay advised to return the item for a refund (as item was not as described). I am sorry, but its not ""not as described"" I said, its counterfeit and I have been a victim of crime (its a criminal offence to sell counterfeit items in the UK). However, after pushing the rep on the issue of fraud they still advised that the only option I had was to open a return case and then escalate to a dispute. Also I needed to provide proof from the manufacturer that the item is fake! The photo of the ""fake"" tag is not sufficient in itself.

So, I see this seller has 1,000+ feedbacks, all positive (londonteacher.2007) and mostly handbags, lots of Coach handbags. There are a lot of people with fake Coach bags without reading they are fakes!

I have initiated the return process, so that I can escalate to the eBay. I have advised the seller that the bag is fake and that I am working with eBay, police and action fraud UK on this. The seller has had audacity to call me a scammer for trying to get an item for free. She is claiming that the item was a sample and she ""bought it in good faith"".

If I return the bag, the seller will simply relist and sell it to a next sucker! Also, I feel, that if I leave negative feedback the seller will simply get it removed as I have not ""proven"" the bag to be fake. 
eBay clearly knows this is an issue, but doesn't have any effective policy in place for dealing effectively with this. 

This is clearly a crime and I have no way to report this, and I will end up having to send the item back without any repercussion to the seller! I feel that there must be a way to to dealing with this.

Obviously if all else fails I will get the money back from the credit card company, but I am really, really trying to play by the rules and let eBay deal with this.

I guess this is more of a rant/story but any thoughts would be appreciated. This is for eBay UK, but I think US has similar laws regarding counterfeit fashion as well.",23,6,2018-02-10,EBAY,0.0796670913696289,0.8914989233016968,0.02883397974073887

Ebay,How to deal with difficult buyers?,"Hi there,

I recently started selling collectibles on eBay and so far (couple dozen sales) everything was ok. Yesterday, some guy made me an offer for a single item 3 times of its price +S&amp;H. I was confused at the beginning but turns out he wanted 3 similar items (he left a comment on his offer, but purchased only a single item) so price x3 makes sense. I accepted his offer, ended two other items and waiting for the payment. 24 hours passed, I'm sending a standard payment remainder message. He replies with a bit mean message telling me that he feel 'insulted' and that eBay and I made calculations wrong and he intended to make an offer without S+H charge, so he can save a couple bucks. I replied that I'm ok removing S&amp;H charge or if he changed his mind regarding the purchase I'm ok with canceling his order. He replied back with again a bit mean message, a few CAPS words and attitude like I was trying to fool him (no direct offense), but still, he's ok paying for the order without S&amp;H charge.

Items he bought are not that expensive, otherwise, I won't risk to ship anything to such customer. But when I started preparing a new invoice, I noticed that in addition to everything his address is an PO box. Besides that eBay doesn't have a track of two other items he is asking me to ship, so he can potentially just initiate a return and ship back to me only a single item that he bought. On another hand, I'm afraid that if I just cancel his order after this entire confusion story he can leave some sort of negative feedback (although he can potentially do the same even if I ship the items to him).

Question to more experienced sellers, should I just play safe and not deal with such potential troublemaker at all, and how you protect yourself when you feel like someone might cause you a trouble?",5,4,2018-02-10,EBAY,0.08690020442008972,0.8786418437957764,0.03445792198181152

Yesterday the buyer reached out to me using a fake Facebook account. This is also the same one used to scam someone else for KDM. He said this:

From 24JAN18 to 5FEB18, I had been in contact with the seller over the issue of me not being able to track the package. I had checked the shipping number multiple times myself and even phoned USPS to check on the item, but we (USPS and myself) were only able to see that shipping had been initiated, which really only means the seller made a label.

So basically my questions are is this some sort of scam? It's been marked as delivered for more than 2 weeks, and now she's asking and claiming to not have received. What are the ramifications and will she be issued a refund, even though the package is marked as delivered?",2,3,2018-02-14,EBAY,0.06209072098135948,0.9056087732315063,0.03230050951242447

Ebay,Bought counterfeit item. Reckon I've lost out...,"I purchased a ""Stone Island"" jacket from a seller on eBay last night. It was in the final seconds of the auction and against all common sense I bid and won.

I paid straight away as normal. 

This morning I showed someone the jacket I had purchased and they straight away said it was a fake. I reached out to the Stone Island community and this was confirmed from multiple sources.

I proceeded to contact the seller to say I no longer wanted the item as it has been raised that it's a fake. They said that they didn't except returns and that they never specified it was legitimate in the post. They also  said I should have done my research before buying it and they had already arranged the courier for it to be sent (not given me any tracking info as of yet).

I asked again for a refund as the eBay resolution centre would most likely refund me and it would just be a waste of both of our time. He said I can do what I like but I won't get a refund.

I think this is where I've made my mistake. As he now knows I am aware this item is fake, I am worried he will potentially use dodgy tracking Ingo or post me out a random item.  What can I do of this happens??

If the jacket does arrive, eBay have said that it's also on me to prove the jacket is fake. Would the fact the seller has said he never specified it was real enough for this case or would I need a legit check from aan authorised retailer etc??",14,3,2018-02-14,EBAY,0.04874444380402565,0.9202025532722473,0.031052950769662857

Ebay,My $2000 item was lost by USPS and now its for sale on eBay. Should I contact the seller myself or wait for the USPS to respond to my claim?,"update:  This item is a hand-built limited edition thing, so each one has a unique number etched into it.  The number wasn't in any of the pictures so I had a friend ask the seller which number it is in the series, and it matches mine.  So it's without a doubt my item. The seller doesn't seem to know that it was stolen and isn't hiding any information.

The local police won't do anything because they're saying it's a federal crime, so now I'm waiting on the USPS and eBay to respond to my claims. I have the seller's username, proof that it's mine, and approximate location (same city as me), and I can't do anything right now.

update 2: I gave up on getting any help from ebay, USPS, or LAPD and contacted the seller myself. He was a decent enough guy to meet me and return the thing.  Here is a pic from my listing compared to a pic from his, which is how I knew for sure it was mine.  Look at the indentations and scratches on the foam.

This was a gift for Valentines and its stuck in China and hasnt left.

Ebay,Buyer won a case with eBay he claims it's fake and it's not,"I've been selling on eBay since 2001. 100% rating. Sold hundreds of things with almost no problems. 

My kids bought an extra pair of highly valuable running shoes from Adidas and I sold two pairs on eBay. One went off without a hitch and the 2nd pair the buyer initially claimed he won two auctions and didn't want the shoes. I was literally doing the refund when he says he'll take them so ship them to him. I do that and two weeks later he claims the shoes are ""off"" and he wants a refund. I know where this is going. I'll get the shoes back and they aren't the ones I sent him so I say it clearly states No Returns and No Refund in the description. He clearly knows the rules and says ebay will favor him. Sure enough a week later eBay says they came down on the buyer's side. 

Buyer is supposed to ship shoes back but I have a feeling I am not going to get back the shoes either in new condition or fakes. Does ebay automatically issue a refund when the shoes get to my house?

Ebay,"Woke up to $66 in eBay fees with no sales, shrugged it off and paid them, now I have another $25 still after no sales!!","I always pay off my eBay fees the second I get them that way I can transfer money out of my Paypal without having to worry about it. Well I got a couple sales yesterday, paid off my fees ($86.39) which felt really high because I only got $308 dollars in sales with a 5% ad fee on both items. My fees should have been 46  dollars, but I shrugged it off figuring I forgot to pay my fees last time. 

Then I woke up this morning to $65.20 sitting in my current balance. I thought, that's weird I didn't get any sales since then.. Maybe FedEx? I looked, and I haven't sold something with FedEx January 23rd and it shouldn't have been 65 dollar shipping. I shrugged it off one more time and paid it off again figuring I must just not have done the math right. Then I just finished listing some stuff for the day when I see my current balance shows I owe ""$24.65"". After a whole day without sales!! 

That's when it hits me, ""oh maybe it's from listing"" But I check and I still have 20 items I can list before I hit my free listings limit.

Ebay,Don't know where else to ask for help at this point any advice really appreciated,"I'm writing this post on behalf of my parents who are now too stressed to write it and I'm just seeking some advice on how to approach their situation. (This is what I make of the situation)

Can't say I've written a reddit post before but it has got to the point where I can't seem to find anyone else with a similar issue to that my parents are experiencing with ebay. They've been running an ebay shop for around 2 years and have sold a substantial amount of items over the last 8 years or so.

The problem started around 5 months ago when the shop fees started going up substantially  (Around £200 more than previously) and at the same time their sales took a massive hit and even with 1000+ listing at its height we were only selling 2-4 items a day compared to previously where it was around 7-10 a day.

They've had to be on the phone to ebay support about this issue for sometimes up to 10+ hours a month because they can't seem to resolve their issue permanently and instead just have been adding credits to the account to reduce the total. 

In the last month the shop fees went up to £900 for the month when they only sold just over  £900 of items in the last 60 days. My parents have got all the calculations for what should be the correct amount of fees for the period if anyone is interested.

They have been on the phone repeatedly being screwed around by ebay support as each time they call they talk to a different individual who says the exact same things and that they will look into it and update them and NOT ONE of the 10 or so support members have come back to my parents with a single bit of news.

Because they were not able to solve any of these issues my parents were unable to pay the substantial fees and this has resulted in the shop being shut down.

Again, my parents have called ebay support to sort it out and they came to an agreement where they paid a certain amount upfront whilst they resolve the issue. 

This was a week ago

Since regaining access to the shop my parents have had to manually repost every single of the 1000+ listings which is a massive task due to having the recalculate stock and other such things.

Today, ebay has put a hold on the account even though there was an agreement and I just don't know what to do anymore because my parents are now too stressed and destroyed to even call ebay support because it has not resolved a single one of their problems in the past

If anyone out there has any idea on how to approach this situation please let me know, I can provide more accurate numbers if need be but I don't want to post it all openly on reddit

Ebay,What should I do to avoid a potential scam involving a local pickup from Ebay?,"So I made a large purchase for some electronics on Ebay (around $2000). The seller had 0 Feedbacks and the account was created on the same day the listing was made. It initially raised some red flags for me but I realized that all sellers had to start at 0 feedback so I gave this posting a shot and decided to proceed cautiously. I made a payment for the full amount through PayPal and since we both realized we lived in the same city, we decided to do a local pickup and the seller agreed to reimburse me for the shipping fee he saved on. We exchanged phone numbers by typing it out using paint and uploading it as a picture attachment in Ebay messages and have been communicating through text for the last few days. What made me a bit suspicious was that:

1.The seller kept postponing the meetup day

2.Today, I received an email saying my purchase has been shipped, with a tracking number to a package that was delivered and picked today but to another address. This is weird since we decided to do a local meetup. When I asked the seller about it, he said its actually a letter he sent to one of his relatives and it was ""an accident"".

So what I am wondering is that is this some sort of scam tactics? I am afraid that since I have been communicating with him through text, Ebay won't take what he said in the texts as evidence against him. What steps should I take so that incase I do open a dispute or case against the seller, that I can win the case/dispute?

Ebay,Suspected stolen item of mine sold on ebay approx 2 months ago.,"It's a common item worth only £30-50 or so and there's a maybe 3 to 5 sold on ebay every day overall.

There's one that was sold not too long ago that has too many coincidences to not believe it was likely mine such as;

- Sold without the boxes (Fairly common, maybe 1/4 of all listings)

- Sold with specific optional accessory (very unusual, something like less than 1 in 100 listings of same item)

- Sold in close proximity to my location (Very unusual, only found two others sold in same distance but without the unusual accessory or boxed)

- Sold approx 1-2 months after item went missing 

There is only a single listing that meets all the criteria to have a strong suspicion its my item and if it turns out it isn't then as far as I'm concerned that's the end of it and it was gone.

I have the original empty boxes with the serial numbers to prove its mine and I wish for contact with the one who bought the item to see if the serial numbers are a match but am unable due to ebay identity protection.

But I can see how it would open a whole can of worms, it's not in the sellers interest to help me as they may be the original thief and it's not in the buyers interest to help me as it's causes them inconvenience and potentially leaves people out of pocket if I am correct and were compelled to give me the item back, just looking for advice.

Would the police consider this enough to help or am I wasting my time and should let it go?

Ebay,Do I have a case against eBay?,"I'm thinking about taking eBay to small claims but realize that's a battle I should choose wisely.  Any thoughts / legal advice would be greatly appreciated!

I've been a user for over 10 years w/ zero issues.

A buyer purchased a Macbook, immediately returned it w/ broken screen then opened a case against me, which they won.  I appealed the case, arguing the seller had broken the screen, which I proved.  
They overturned the case in my favor, gave me the okay to fix Macbook screen, which I did at a cost of $500+ dollars.  They then messaged me, confirming that the $500+ would be deposited in my paypal account within 48 hours.  
They never sent the money, and instead pulled the full $17000 cost of computer and never paid me the $500.  I spoke to Paypal, sent them the message eBay had sent, and they agreed that at the very least they should have informed me of a cancellation of said payment.

My Dad recently passed of cancer, and unbelievably (he and) my mother's house burnt down.  In other words I am running on fumes financially and have been moving money around from one account to the next.  
Because eBay sent a confirmation of those funds being sent, I did not buffer my checking account with an extra $500.  This resulted in numerous overdraft fees, etc. and essentially the beginning of my end as I had little room for error.  I am no longer selling on eBay, thou they haven't suspended my account.

I believe that eBay, at the very least, owes me the money they confirmed they were sending.  I have spoken to them on the phone numerous time and they never have a good answer, out of the many they try to give...if any at all.  

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",9,14,2018-02-18,EBAY,0.0379507839679718,0.9160552024841309,0.045994020998477936
Ebay,Should I leave Neutral/Neg feedback?,"Hi.. last week I purchased some art supplies from a seller that lives in the same state as I do (4 hours away). Handling/ship time stated 2 business days (I'm accounting for weekends). 

Any way, I sent her an e-mail on Wednesday  asking for the tracking number, explaining that we have different mail carriers, as well as package thieves and that I wanted to be on the lookout.

She responded and said the item had shipped, didn't provide tracking. I figured it'd show up soon, no big deal.

Didn't show up yesterday (Saturday)... so I figure that most likely the package is lost/stolen. I contact seller asking again for tracking number so I can figure out where it is. Seller tells me she'll send it later.

Today I get an e-mail from Ebay that a mail label has been printed out. Very infuriating.

In this case, is it appropriate to leave neutral or negative feedback? If she had been upfront that she had not put my paint in the mail, it would've been fine.

Ebay,Purchaser has been sending lots of weird comments asking for money etc.,"As a preface, i'm not really an ebay seller. I use the site to buy things occasionally, I think i've only ever sold one thing before, and without issue.

I recently sold my old laptop, a 4 year old Macbook Pro. Purchase went through fine, shipment was made, buyer thanked me etc. but then started complaining about the battery life. There's a language barrier issue i think, i can't really understand what he's trying to say half the time, it reads like it's fed through talk and type or something but essentially, he said that the listing mentioned ""up to 9 hours battery"" which was the original spec list from the manufacturer, i included in the description alongside the chipset, drive size etc. the usual stuff. (i actually copied and pasted it from another listing).

At any rate, the battery was of normal health according to system profiler. It was my personal laptop and i kept it in very good condition. He asked for £60 for a replacement battery he found and money for someone to replace it, which i declined obviously stating that the listing said ""up to"" and that batteries are consumable parts, they don't hold indefinite charge.

I've been polite though and requested several times he raise any issues with ebay directly.

For the record, he hasn't requested a return and i'd even have been willing to accept one however, from other messages i'm getting now about ""broken uab"" _sic_ i know believe this person has attempted to replace the battery and has broken something. The laptop was near pristine condition.

To my knowledge, he hasn't raised any case with ebay, however I just have, anticipating the worst.

I'm aware that ebay can obligate returns and, from reading here pretty much always side with the purchaser.

Can any more experienced sellers please advise whether they'd force me to accept a return for a device this person may likely have physically damaged by attempting self-repair? There's email records of him requesting money for replacement battery and labour? I'd accept a return if it was in the condition it was sent but not if he's opened it up and broken it. For the record, i have video of it powering on etc. from when i first posted it, not that i imagine that would help.

Any advice is much appreciated, many thanks.",14,6,2018-02-18,EBAY,0.04099578410387039,0.9195634126663208,0.03944075480103493
Ebay,I am at a loss on why my items do not sell.

The items i sell are collectible cards, so they are what they are, nothing can change besides a few things (such as condition etc..)

* The price i'm asking for is the lowest currently available.
* Between my listing and now 5 days later, there have been more then 20 on the exact same items sold with a higher price attached to it.
* My account has 373 reviews, and 100% are positive.
* I do offer free shipment (might be the issue?)
* All of the other sold items did offer certified shipment
* I have made very indept descriptions with full honesty and choices to the buyer, making it very secure and comfortable for them to buy + choose the best way to ship them on MY costs.
* The pictures i make are very detailed while the ones sold are open for a lot of perspective, these cards have absolutely no damage whatsoever and are in perfect shape, while sold listings had very hard to spot pictures, yet received 25 bids?

Ebay,Seller wont send tracking number? I'm not sure what to do,"So, I'm in kind of a weird situation? I have been looking for an item for a long time, and I finally found one but on UK ebay and the seller would not ship to America.

My item was supposed to arrive at the parcel forwarding within 4 days (latest estimated delivery was Feb 7). I've received nothing. My parcel forwarding service has been very responsive, but I have gotten no email from ebay about my item arriving. The seller would not respond to emails, and finally I had to report that my item wasn't received to get a response from them. Apparently, they shipped it with a tracking number but now cannot find the receipt with the number. They're claiming they'll go to the mail service and get the tracking number but haven't yet. But, why wouldn't they have just sent me the number to begin with? On the 20th (its the 18th right now) is the first day I can escalate this, and I'm not sure if I should? Do I wait and see if I got the tracking number? How long until I'm out of ebay's window where they'll help me if I reported the item not received already?

Ebay,Did i do the right thing reporting a seller and getting him shut down?,"This has been bugging me for a while. I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

A few years ago, i bought a pretty expensive torch/flash light from a seller on ebay.

The listing was from within the UK, and they seemed to sell a lot of torches/flash lights from that brand, all 100% positive feedback and must have been well over 1000 feedback.

So i ordered it, first warning sign was the payment went to China.

Double checked the listing, listing is located in London. 

Item arrived, looked perfect, worked perfect, then i sent the serial number to the manufacturer to verify it's genuine.

FAKE, they said it's 100% fake. 

So i emailed the seller, he was pretty much an A hole. until i threatened to get ebay involved, he issued a refund.

Now, for the next 2 weeks he emailed me around 50 times, Leave 5 star feedback, Leave 5 star feedback. Over and over again.

This is when i got P off, and messaged some of the other buyers of his stuff to check their serial numbers, every single one of them came back as fake. (i even got some people telling him i was asking them, and them being angry with me for telling them they got scammed).

So i informed ebay of what was happeneing and traiding standards (as it was from a import/export hub in london).

He got shut down on ebay, said i ruined his life and took the food out his childrens mouth's.  

Ever since, i've felt bad and it's played on my mind. I've always had the principle that if your selling something, you shouldn't decieve someone, scam them or over charge them. Which he was doing.

It could have potentially killed someone if his fake light stopped working when someone really needed it. 

Edit_

TLDR seller was selling fake flash lights, expensive ones, turned he sold a lot of fakes, badgered me for 5 star positive feedback, so i reported him and he got shut down.",31,31,2018-02-19,EBAY,0.23179315030574799,0.746046245098114,0.022160604596138

Ebay,Trademark and Copyright Violations,"I think hurting sellers for ""Trademark and Copyright Violations"" is the most bullshit thing eBay is currently still doing IN THE WAY they are doing it.

You list items and some point in the future, could be days, weeks, or months later you get an email from eBay reviewing your account, pulling these items and potentially revoking your selling privileges for X days. 

These items are typically being sold all over eBay which is why you yourself sell them. If you can't find your item it's kind of a red flag but when there is a healthy market you don't suspect a thing. I sell a lot of things, I probably list around 4000 things a year.

Yeti, P90X, Insanity, LG, Adobe, Rosetta Stone, Intuit, Williams &amp; Sonoma, NFL, Elevare 

These are all companies I have had violations with in the past 2 years.  I violate ;) each company once and after the item gets removed I don't relist it because now I know.

My problem stems from eBay removing seller restrictions for these violations as they stack like normal violations. Understandably eBay tells you what you can list on their site. It's fairly easy to understand but has it's gray areas. The key point being it's a publically available list. 

Violations in the same category of violation typically stack Warning&gt;1&gt;3&gt;7&gt;30 days. 

Here is the thing. Trademark violations are completely random you can't POSSIBLY read trademark papers for every item you list. The fact different companies violations stack to hurt the seller is by far the dumbest thing they currently do. eBay hurts sellers with their current system and if I have to read copyright and trademark paperworks for every item I sell that's a terrible precedent to set.",10,6,2018-02-19,EBAY,0.20911064743995667,0.7704964280128479,0.020392926409840584

Ebay,Listing removed due to SIAA/VeRO Complaint- help?,"Hi, /r/eBay. I'm posting this to see if anyone has any insight; advice; tips:

I've been selling on eBay since I was a teenager, mainly computers and electronics but the occasional video game or phone accessory here and there. What I've had great success with the last few months are 16GB USB drives imaged with macOS installers [Mavericks; Yosemite; El Capitan; Sierra; High Sierra]. I previously sold Windows 10 USB drives but the profit margins were so low I decided to explore other operating systems. I buy the drives pretty cheap [~$6-7 USD] and typically sell for $25-35. 

I've had no complaints from buyers and no previous warnings. My account has 100% positive feedback and I'm rated Above Standard, yet this morning I received a message from eBay stating that a VeRO complaint was submitted today by [SIIA](http://www.siia.net) for a listing that ended over a week ago. I've never heard of them but a cursory review of their Web site leads me to believe they're a genuine entity. 

Here's what I don't understand: these installers are freely available. I'm not selling counterfeit items; Apple hasn't charged for their OS since Mountain Lion. My customers are people with slow Internet connections who don't want to wait days/hours for the Mac App Store to download the files or need to deploy the OS to multiple machines. Some have bought Macs with no HDDs or replaced their HDDs with SSDs and need an OS.

I don't want to be suspended by eBay for continuing to sell these but I don't think I'm doing anything wrong.

Ebay,"Buyer returned empty parcel, have multiple proofs showing this yet eBay is favoring with buyer. Help.","Hi I need your help, 


TL:DR; Sold phone, buyer returned empty parcel, video'd me opening said parcel. Told eBay straight away and was told everything would be fine yet this is not the case. Have proof the buyer didnt send parcel, have proof from post office the parcel could not contain item i sent yet eBay dont care and have sided with buyer. Buyer even said he did not return parcel and it was his brother and he has no idea. Parcel weighs 119 grams whereas phone weighs 155 grams by itself.


So i sold a Samsung Galaxy S8 to a eBay user in Bulgaria. After about a week of the buyer using the phone he began to complain of signal issues and asked for a return. He acknowledged he received the phone. Buyer then opened a case and I acknowledged that he was having an issue and agreed to accept a return. I told buyer to return the phone in the condition in which i received it and the buyer also agreed. 

Fast forward to me receiving the parcel and i feel it is very very light and it could possibly not contain a phone. So I decided to take a video of me weighing and opening the parcel. The parcel for me weighed around 100 grams. The phone i sent which is an S8 weighs 155 grams by itself so this parcel could not have contained the phone i sent. I also recorded the weight of the parcel and phone when i shipped it and also have proof on my postage receipt with the weight of the phone. So i made a video saying all this and contacted eBay live chat immediately. 
They told me ""In this situation, I suggest you not to issue a refund to the buyer. In case the buyer escalate the case to us, we'll take an appropriate action.""

I asked ""Will I just leave it as is and let you guys sort it out?""


They responded ""Sure Rugile , please do not worry, we'll take care of the case for you.""
 
So as you can read from this I am in a very good position eBay agree with me. But this wasnt the case, the buyer noticed i received the phone back and notified eBay who said they were reviewing the case. I was set back by this because I was told everything would be fine, wasnt I?  and i would have nothing to worry about. 

Again I immediately contacted eBay live chat explaining my situation and got this: 
""Since you received the item back, I will be closing this case in your buyer's favour. This is then allow you to make an appeal since you received an empty parcel."" 
""This will then allow you to make an appeal since you received an empty parcel.*""


I asked this: ""Will i quote the original chat transcript that i had?""

And she replied saying to do and again I thought I would be fine. So i appealed this decision again thinking everything would be fine and I wake up to this email:
""I have thoroughly reviewed the case and can see that it was closed on your buyer's favour as they have provided tracking information that the item was delivered to you. Please understand that as we didn't see the exact condition of the item received by the buyer, we're also not able to verify the condition the item should have been returned to you in. While this may seem unfair to you, please know that we investigate all similar appeals in this manner and we base our decision on the information on hand.""

Then then told me to go to the UK smalls claim court even though I am not from the UK. I replied asking why this was the case and got the exact same email again in response. So to further prove i did not recive a phone in the parcel I contacted the Bulgarian post office and asked them to prove the weight of the item that was shipped since the buyer would not provide me with the original receipt and the responded with the following:

""Thank you for your e-mail.
The weight of the item is 119 grams.
Please contact the sender for more information.""

So eBay's argument is that they have no idea of the condition the item the buyer received it in yet the buyer said he was suing the phone. Also the phone according to Wikipedia weighs 155 grams. So again parcel = 119grams so package could not contain parcel. Again, I forwarded this information to eBay and laos decided to contact the buyer who gave me this response:
""I can not explain it. I did not let this to my brother come back for you. I am out of the country, these days I come back. I will immediately contact you and resolve everything. have a nice day""

I asked: ""So does this mean you left the phone with your brother to be returned to me?""

He replied ""yes, I had to leave suddenly. I left the packet on him to send it."" 

So now I have video of me opening parcel, email off of Bulgarian post showing parcel could not have contained phone and email off of the buyer saying he didn't even send the phone back. Again I contact eBay and a manager reply's and she says the following:



""This is Gerlyn, one of the Managers here on eBay and I am getting in touch regarding the case: . I’m sorry to hear that you’ve received the item back but empty package. I know that it can be disappointing to have a Not as Described case closed in the other person’s favour, and I’d like to explain how we reached our decision.

 

When dealing with Not as Described cases, we always ensure that we remain impartial and make the fairest decision that we can. After the buyer filed their Not as Described case, you were allowed 8 days to resolve their complaint. As you were unable to provide a resolution that they were happy with during this period, we decided that the best solution was for the buyer to return the item to you for a full refund.


If you’re unhappy with this Not as Described case being opened, there are a few things that you can do.

Ebay,Ebay Sellers OUTRAGED At These New Changes Ebay Have Made To Listings Without Asking For Shop Owner Feedback First!,"As you may or may not know, all Ebay sellers who run their own shops and pay a monthly subscription fee to do so, have been hit with some rather unwelcome changes to their listings. And to top it all, Ebay sneakily announced via the forums that this change will be permanent. 

If you run a shop, you are allowed to run Promotions on your listings, such as Buy 2 Get 1 Free, or 30% off If You Buy 3 or More. Up until now, these promotions have always been highlighted at the top of the listing with a nice red banner, so that if I buyer is looking at the item, they know straight away that there's a promotion on said item. This has managed to boost sales for many shop owners and some rely on it as their only way to stay competitive. 

As of a couple of days ago, Ebay moved this banner to the very very bottom of the listings, just after the final lines of the item description, leaving many buyers not even aware that the item is in a promotion. This has left Ebay shop owners complaining that instead of the multiple sales that they are used to , they are only selling one or 2 items (even if buying two items entitled them to another free item). They are reporting back that customers are simply not aware of the promotion anymore and therefore don't take advantage of the offers. 

On a 10 page forum post, dedicated to the subject (Go check the sellers forum to see the full details), shop owners are desperately pleading their case as to why it should be returned to the top. They are missing out on sales daily and have reported decreased profits since the change, yet Ebay are curiously quiet on the whole matter. Well, that is apart from the rather abrupt message left on the forum by Customer Rep Ilona which read... ""Hello Everyone,
Regarding this, I can advise that the decision has now been made to make this change permanent. We are however still working on further changes to the View Item Page to make promotions effective for buyers as much as more sellers. ..As always your feedback is welcome. Thank you ,Ilona""

After this message was left customers have been reacting with outright rage at such a foolish move from Ebay without even consulting shop owners or warning them of any changes to their listings and promotions. One user states ""How is it a company of this size can't even produce a simple bl**dy article as to why this change was done? we get some ebay lackee on a forum writing that this change is permanent. I'm sorry but what? you ask for feedback and you don't even tell us why you just ignored 10 pages of comments.""

Another angry user took to the boards to exclaim ""I’m really annoyed by this whole fiasco, but what is really annoying me is it took sellers on a discussion board to bring this to people’s attention. Ebay didn’t tell us about these changes and staff didn’t even know if it was the usual ebay glitch a test or god knows what. It was then put back for a few days &amp; everyone thought they had seen sense but no we are told a few days later the change to bottom of page is now permanent.  I challenge someone from ebay to come on here &amp; explain why this move has happened and how it improves the customer experience, a better sales conversion for sellers &amp; thus increases ebays revenue. But we all know this is fantasy ebay will do what they want &amp; won’t tell us anything.""

Some have been more measured in their response, but is is no less disparaging of Ebays move...""Hi ilona,You asked for feedback....This is a really negative change for us.
We supply garden irrigation equipment and our items are all highly related... we do a lot of cross selling.
The promotional listing we offer is £5 off every £25 and it encourages people to build a cart of products to suit their garden.  The offer essentially allows us to return the savings we are making on postage by due to the multiple purchases.  This is cost saving customers get to enjoy.
With the offer now being relegated to the bottom and no promotion being generated to the customer that we have a host of associated items as well as the search results having no additional attraction and the listings not carrying any offer decoration, the offer system is now worthless to us.
It is not good business to attract people to buy something and then give them extra money back after they have already decided to buy.  Like a cashier ringing up a different price than the ticket at the till in your favour.  You think how many more items they would be selling if people knew and the shelf clearly showed it, same principal.
We are actually more anxious about the loss of cross sale user experience.  Unless customers now come into our ebay shop (which very few ebay users actually end up doing), they will not be aware of our associated range.""



Ebay have yet to comment further on the change.

I for one would maybe not notice such a promotion unless it was brought immediately to my attention, like browsing a shop that has big red sale tags on their items, it catches the eye and peaks the interest. If I ran an Ebay store, I would not want to shoot myself in the foot by hiding my most important promotions from the potential customer. So it's rather strange that Ebay have made this change. 
Some customers are even crying conspiracy as they say this has forced them to use Ebays Paid Promotions which, for a larger percentage of the sale than usual, Ebay will display your listings more prominently in the search results, making more money for Ebay, but damaging its solid customer base of sellers who, without them, Ebay would be nothing more than empty shelves. 

Is this fair of Ebay to harm their business customers revenues? Would you as a shop owner agree with any sudden and profit hurting changes without so much as a heads up? Leave your thoughts below and if anyone feels strongly about it, get in touch with Ilona at Ebay customer services.

Ebay,eBay (uk) double dipped for refund,"Having a hard time with eBay customer services getting them to understand that they've charged me twice for a refund.

Late last year a buyer requested a refunded which there weren't enough funds in Paypal for. eBay took the amount (£112) from my current account via Paypal to remove the hold on my account and we were all square. Paypal account was fine, payments have been made for other things I've bought in the interim and all has been well.

Today I got paid for another, separate, sale which took my Paypal balance over £112. Straight away a payment for another £112 to eBay appeared, showing as a refund to the same customer.

So I'm down £112 from my current account (taken last November) and another £112 from the funds sent over by the buyer who just paid me. I've had a look at my eBay account and they're not showing as a credit over there.

Just been on to eBay customer services who *insist* they never took any money out of my current account last November, despite it being in black and white on my PayPal account and bank statement. They're trying to say that the November transaction just put me in debit and that the amount they took today cleared it.

They say they're opening a case, but were obviously following a script and had no damn idea what to do. Any advice to help get this resolved would be most welcome.

Ebay,Buyer saying they have not received item despite tracking # confirming they signed for it,"Hi, I sold a game on Ebay a couple of weeks back to a buyer that had 0 feedback. Now I've used the site for quite a few years so I was very hesitant about delivering to somebody with no feedback, so I waited a couple of days to see what happened with the account and they ended up getting positive feedback from somebody else. So I risked it, but instead of delivering as 2nd class post which I offered on the listing, I went with first class and signed for, just to ensure I had something to fall back on if it went dodgy. Well, it went dodgy. They opened up a case on the 17th saying they hadn't received the item, I've been in contact with them for a few days about it and they've continued to insist it hasn't arrived and requested a refund. 

Today, I found the receipt with the tracking info and checked the Royal Mail's website, and low and behold - Delivered and signed for by the buyer - 12 hours BEFORE they opened the case. I've now added the tracking details to the case and written a message to the buyer informing them I know they are lying and have asked them to close the case. 

Today is the final day to sort it out between myself and the buyer before Ebay step in, I'm just wondering how likely they are to side with me considering I have the proof the buyer signed for it? I've had problems with Paypal in the past about them siding with people who were clearly in the wrong.

Ebay,Ebay sent a message to a seller pretending to be me?!,"Hi all.

A little confused and wondered if anyone had ever seen anything like this (or if it's even allowed?!)

To cut a long story short, I purchased an item on eBay about 10 days ago. The seller, a few days after I purchased the item, refunded me my money with no explanation or communication as to why this was the case. Naturally, I reached out to eBay to see if there was anything that could be done. I was reassured that they would investigate on my behalf (and I have the transcript from this conversation where the representative said 'I am going to get in touch with them now and ask them whats going on with the order').

Today, I saw an email appear in my inbox saying I had sent a message to the seller in question (I hadn't). Thinking it was a spoof, I logged onto my eBay and went to sent messages and, sure enough, there was a sent message there. It appears eBay has sent the seller a message from my account posing as me regarding the item?!

Has anyone seen this before? Is this allowed?

Ebay,"Got full refund for item that came with broken accessory, feel kinda bad about getting to keep it but seller is very shady","So i bought an item for just over $300 recently and when I got it i realized the listed shipping weight was much higher than the actual weight (which inflated my shipping cost) and an accessory to the item was broken (worth about 40 dollars) but otherwise the item was fine and I was pretty happy. I messaged the seller because I wanted a partial refund for the accessory as the item was listen as new, and wanted to keep the item. He/she doesn't respond so I open a case detailing basically what i've said about and a week goes by with nothing happening and now I just found out i got a full refund and get to keep the item.

I looked through the seller's history and there are tons of people having problems with the seller and losing money. I feel kind of bad that I get to keep the item and the money but at the same time I am also happy. I thought i'd post this just to kind of get it off my chest. I also realize perhaps the seller will in the future message me about getting some of the money and that they have my info, which is kind of troubling, but they are located 1,000 miles away.
The weird thing is the seller stopped posting items after I bought mine and has not posted anything since, and obviously did not respond to me or ebay since they would have preferred to give me back a partial refund rather than losing all the money. The seller was a wholesaler apparently who would resell overstock/return items, my item came in a very mashed up box and repeatedly taped over, though it was advertised as new. It was also an amazon only item, so I'm kind of confused how it ended up being sold by this company.

The other thing that was weird was that the shipping weight was actually incorrectly listed on the package too, and in the UPS system. So I don't know if the seller actually profited from that or is just disorganized or what. I also noticed many other sellers commented that their purchases had incorrect shipping weights.

Ebay,My GF Just Got Scammed. Need Help,"Hey Reddit,

My girlfriend recently sold her iPhone for $400 on eBay (buy it now). Immediately after she sold it, the purchaser messaged her saying to send it to another address in a different town:

[PURCHASER REQUESTS DIFFERENT ADDRESS](https://i.imgur.com/sFZIW7G.jpg)

She didn’t think anything of it at the time so agreed and sent it to the requested address. It was delivered, but a few days later, she got a message from the purchaser saying it was delivered to a wrong address.  

[PURCHASER SAYS IT ISN'T DELIVERED ON THE RIGHT ADDRESS.](https://i.imgur.com/Ha0d9rE.jpg)

What my girlfriend later realized was that original message requesting a change in address of delivery was another user altogether than the purchaser (new account, with 0 ratings). She didn’t realize it at the time because of a combination of the speediness of the message being sent after purchase, being overworked, and being used to other platforms to sell. 

[Proof of payment PayPal FEB 11 2018, 07:26 AM](https://i.imgur.com/DtzmGjn.jpg)

The account it was purchased on (with valid ratings and payment made via PayPal) bought the phone at 7:26 AM. The message from the 0 rating account sent a message at 7:41 AM requesting it to be sent under a different address. It’s obvious that these are both the same individual who are scamming by taking advantage of the eBay/PayPal policy where sellers must use ship to the address on the account in order to be covered.

Ebay,Seller Status : Below Standard | What Do I Do?,"So, I just saw that my seller status has been lowered to ""Below Standard"". I checked what happened, and the only thing against my account is ""Transaction Defect Rate"":  

Transactions you canceled for being out of stock	8	2.64%  
Cases closed without seller resolution	1	0.33%   

The closed without seller resolution I cannot remember. Was before I started getting full time into eBay. The canceled for being out of stock was a different story.  

So when I created my PayPal account 9 years ago, I was under the age of 18. I started selling on eBay HARD in December. I was able to make about 300 sales for over $20k in 2 months. Paypal then decided to close my account due to it being opened when I was underage. They let me open a new account, but all the money on the old account was being held.  

I had 15 open orders, and due to PayPal holding my funds, I had to wait until that Friday when my retail job paid me so I could afford the shipping cost(I know this was dumb. I now have $500 set aside if this ever happens again.) I called the buyers based on the phone numbers on the paypal, and talked with them and explained the issue. 7 of the buyers understood completely, and let me ship that Friday. 8 people however asked me to cancel the order and refund the money(as I was able to do this). I canceled the orders, but did not know what to put so I just hit the first one and canceled.  

Now I have these remarks against my account, and I am sitting at 2.97% transaction defect rate. I know that I need to get to the 2.00% mark to get back to where I was. I was never going for Top Rated.  

How does this effect me? Would I be able to call eBay and have this reversed? It looks like I need another 200 sales to get back into the okay area. Any advice?

What are my options? I sent the Portugese seller a message and he is really not happy and only sent me his adres. I messaged him last Friday to ask how to go about it as I never saw a message that told me I can't return it as it wasn't bought on eBay.com. I don't feel good just popping his address on it and handing it in at the post office. What are my options here? I've never had this happen in the 17 years I've been using eBay.",12,3,2018-02-26,EBAY,0.07967032492160797,0.8845093846321106,0.03582032397389412

Ebay,Is February normally a slow sales month?,"I've been selling on eBay for about 6 months.  Things have been getting better each month and I've seen steady growth.  January was my best month yet but this month sales just seem to have stopped.

Are people still recovering from the holidays or what is going on?  I've noticed that there can be no activity for a as long as two weeks and then a flurry of activity at the beginning and end of the months so I'm assuming that's payday for many.  I thought sales might pick up during the final weekend of February but sadly not.

Just thought I'd come on and ask more experienced sellers in February was typically a slow month?

Ebay,Advanced search issue.,"I was doing some research. The item was a bronze medal made for the Bank of Pittsburgh. The first search, I typed in 'Bank of Pittsburgh' and there were (I forget the exact number) let's say, 100 results, 4 of which were my medal. To narrow it down, I added the word 'medal' (I believe, it could have been 'medallion'), which was in the title of 3 of the 4 listings previously returned. However, this time, only 1 listing showed. I am wondering if anyone can tell me why, under those set of circumstances, the 2nd query only returned the 1 listing?",4,5,2018-02-27,EBAY,0.035497840493917465,0.9258235692977905,0.03867853805422783
Ebay,How do I ensure I get my full refund back?,"Seller shipped an item that was defective and looks like it was damaged in shipping. The box was fine, but it was inadequately packaged. I contacted them immediately with photos, and got push back that it wasn't damaged and the condition I received it was acceptable. 

They were really reluctant to take the item back but finally agreed to refund the entire thing and pay for a shipping label, but not without a lot of back and forth first. 

I'm really afraid now that I'm going to get scammed somehow by the seller because the interaction has not been pleasant. All the replies to the negatives on their account have been unprofessional and defensive, which goes along with the attitude I'm getting. Is it possible for them to deny the refund after I mail the item back?

I've never returned anything to a seller before. What steps do I need to take to protect myself? All the messages were sent through eBay, so I have it in writing. Taking eBay and PayPal out of the equation, would I still be able to dispute it through my credit card if the refund doesn't go through in full?",6,5,2018-02-27,EBAY,0.07276750355958939,0.8905566334724426,0.03667590022087097

He claims the item is fake because it doesn't match tags like his other shirt of the same brand.  The item has the tags from the department store it was purchased as well as the tags from the manufacture.  Is there anything I can do about this?  If he claims its fake can I have him prove it?

Ebay,I am SO DONE with auction-style listings,"Hey everyone. New to this subreddit but I just have to vent, if you don't mind. 

I'm trying to sell a brand new DVD on eBay. A couple weeks ago I listed it as an auction starting at 99 cents. The bidding went okay, and it sold for like 5 bucks. Not great, but I was okay with it. I wait three days and no payment... So, I open a case in the resolution center, wait another four days, get my final value fee back, and relist. My dumb butt thinks another auction is a good idea. 

This time it sells for around 15 dollars. In my head, I thank the previous guy for not buying it -- this is a lot better! Wrong. I wait two days, no payment. And now I've received a message from the buyer saying they're not interested because they bought it cheaper somewhere else. I'm so peeved off right now. Why don't people realize that when they bid on an item they are entering into a contract to BUY that item????? Now I have to open another case, wait ANOTHER four days, and relist. 

This time my dumb butt will be listing it as a buy it now item... 

But what really pisses me off the most is that I cannot figure out how to give the buyer negative feedback. When I go to leave feedback, I'm given the option of positive feedback or to report the buyer. If I choose report the buyer, my feedback is sent to eBay but doesn't show up on the buyer's feedback page. Do I have to click ""positive"" in order to leave my comment??

Ebay,Buyer opened a paypal dispute before the product even arrived?,"So I sold some expensive clothing about 2 weeks ago and it just delivered 2 days ago. I noticed just now that the buyer filed a dispute that the product was not as described 1 week before the product arrived. I've heard that paypal always sides with the buyer however will I have a case here? I also sent them an offer to refund their money if they return the product just so I don't have to deal with them anymore but I'm curious what the best course of option is. 

Also it seems like this is some sort of scamming method as if a paypal dispute is opened and there is no response within 10 days the buyer automatically gets their money back.
