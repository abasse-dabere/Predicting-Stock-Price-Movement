Ebay,Help resolving problem with ebay seller,"Long story short, a seller on ebay sold me a counterfeit (and defective no less) item and has been ignoring my messages in my attempt to resolve the problem. 

I've heard nightmare stories of trying to get one's money back from Paypal/ebay so I was wondering if I could get some input from anyone who can give. ebay claims to have this ""ebay protection"" gimmic, has anybody actually gotten money back through it?

Should I file a claim with ebay? File a claim with Paypal? Should I just backcharge the purchase on my credit card? Or I do some combination of both?

It seems to me that there are multiple ways of getting back my money...",12,6,2011-01-03,EBAY,0.05763822793960571,0.9099324345588684,0.032429326325654984

Ebay,How long should I wait for buyer to pay?,First time ebayer.  Sold 3 items and sent 3 invoices.  First two paid right away and I sent the items.  The 3rd hasn't paid yet.

Ebay,Raising money,"for myself and my fiancee.  We are both unemployed.  After one month of applying at place after place I have found myself a part time job, but they are not adding me to the schedule until the end of January...and they pay every two weeks, so it will be a while until our next income will arrive.  (neither one of us qualify for unemployment in NH) So I am selling some of my stuff on Ebay to try to gather some money until then.  If nothing on there interests you, maybe you could pass the link on to someone else.  Thank you :-)

Ebay,Sold an item and then it took a very long time to ship. Buyer opened a case against me and ebaY ordered me to refund her. Now after the case has been closed I find out through my tracking that the item arrived. What can I do?,"So The Item was paid for on the 20th of october and I shipped it to NSW Australia via Canada Post surface (at request of buyer, cheapest method possible) on the 25th of October.  The item took a very long time to make it overseas, however Canada post noted that surface mail to Australia can take up to 8 weeks. at around 5 weeks the buyer opened a case against me due to item not arriving.  the case was open for aprox. a week at which time ebaY ruled in favor of the buyer.  I made an appeal stating that I had done due diligence and that it was literally out of my hands also noting Canada Post's published shipping times.  They denied my appeal and I was ordered to pay her back. 

Fast forward Two weeks, after I opened a claims investigation with Canada Post I was notified that the item was successfully delivered according to Canada Post tracking.  I called ebay and a Claims representative told me that my only option now was to ask nicely for the buyer to repay me.  So I did, and with no surprise she hasn't responded.  

My question you you reddit, short of harassing her via ebaY msgs. and email what can I do to get my money back?  

TL;DR Ebay ruled in favor of buyer, I refunded buyer, now item has arrived confirmed by tracking, I contact buyer asking her to repay me and no response. What are my options.",3,2,2011-01-16,EBAY,0.04138399660587311,0.9178987741470337,0.04071727395057678
Ebay,"I sold an item, the buyer says it is broke but won't contact the shipper for a claim.","I sold a set of bike wheels, the auction ended right after Christmas, I shipped them on the 29th of Dec, they arrived at their destination on Jan 7th, and on the 11th I got a message saying one of the wheels is damaged.  There was no damage when I boxed and sent the wheels, but now she wants the money back.  She also doesn't think they were damaged in shipping and won't file a claim with Fedex. 
I did specify in the ebay auction no returns, but I'm not sure that is worth anything.
So the question is, am I going to have to send them back and replace the damaged part on my dime, if she won't try to get Fedex involved?",3,2,2011-01-17,EBAY,0.08540436625480652,0.8712208867073059,0.04337478056550026

Ebay,Your billing agreement for eBay seller fees,"I just got an email last night notifying me I had made a change to my paypal account authorizing preapproved payments to Ebay for my seller fees.  I found this strange since I had not changed any settings in my ebay or paypal account.  So after going through ~5 pages of settings I find the Preauthorized payments page in Paypal, and sure enough Ebay Inc is on there, with a billing limit of 300,000 USD?!?

Has anyone else seen this?  I found it strange since the email was legit (links were real, not spoofs), and who spends 300,000 USD in ebay seller fees?",2,2,2011-01-22,EBAY,0.08907095342874527,0.8863006830215454,0.02462841011583805
