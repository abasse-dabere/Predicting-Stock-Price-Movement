Ebay,What to do when USPS destroys item? (As a seller),"The item I sold to the buyer got destroyed by USPS in transit. It was mailed in a bubble mailer and the item is now folded with creases (it is a post card).

Ebay,$0.50 extra to list with eBay's mobile app.,"Edit:  I took a chance and tried publishing the listing from the iPad app.  Even though it says it will charge me, so far I have not received a charge to my seller account.  I think maybe it is just a bug in the app like one of the comments suggests.

-----------------------------------------------
Perhaps this is common knowledge, but it's new to me and I think people need to know. I caught onto this when I tried to relist something from my iPad.  

I created a listing and tried to post it on my iPad as well as from Chrome on my pc. The listings are identical. I even used the same picture uploads. (eBay has a pretty slick cloud storage thing for pictures)

The iPad tries to charge me a listing fee of $0.50. While the Chrome listing does not. In the browser listing, it says I qualified for a free insertion fee. That can be seen here:

Please don't reply to this message. It was sent from an address that doesn't accept incoming email.""*

The email address they showed on this message is NOT my email address so apparently there were some shenanigans going on with my account.

I have called them several times over the past 2 months to discuss this and I keep getting the run around.  They say its escalated and to wait for a call back etc etc.  So that happened 4 times and I received no call back or email back.  Today I asked for a supervisor...instead I got a ""specialist"" who barely paid me any attention and just re-iterated that it was escalated and to wait.  

I am sick of waiting. 

I have had this account for 12 years and I really only buy or sell once in a while, like 5 or 6 times a year.  I didn't do anything wrong and no one seems to give a damn about helping me.  

Does anyone have any advice to offer about this?  Am I screwed?

Ebay,"First time selling, a few questions.","Hello everyone. I am selling my first item on ebay and have a couple of questions. The item in question is a tablet, it seems that most sell in the ~200-300 range. I put my starting bid at the low 200s and have gotten my first bid finally (actually two from the same account, not sure why, the price didn't change), though I have a concern. The account has 0 feedback and was made a day ago. Is this common?

Also when I finally do sell it I need to ship it, what is the best way to package a tablet? I have the original box and everything it came in when I got it at the store, should I bubble wrap it and put it in a box or what?

When I finally do ship it, when is it safe to spend my money? I really can't afford to get money, ship it, then get a dispute later down the road and have to pay the person back (after I have spent the money). Is there some sort of time period or way that the buyer confirms that he received the item intact and is satisfied so they can't further dispute the sale?

Should I send via USPS or UPS?

Also are there any common scams I need to look out for?

One last thing, should I get insurance on the package, how much would it cost? Should I also require a signature?",13,2,2012-08-02,EBAY,0.02969578467309475,0.9203194975852966,0.04998470097780228
Ebay,Shipping items with a thickness greater than 25mm in the UK (Royal Mail),"Hiya. Not sure if there are many Brits in this subreddit but thought I'd give my query a bash anyway:

I have a few books I'd like to get rid of on eBay. Whilst not particularly big or heavy, they are just a few millimetres too fat to sneak into Royal Mail's ""large letter"" category. This is quite frustrating since for all intents and purposes the items are pretty much large letters. No amount of corseting with bits of sticky tape and tight packing materials is going to squeeze these chubby little things into the metaphorical ""large letter"" dress.

This is frustrating as Royal Mail's broad categorisations mean anything thicker than 25mm gets bundled into the ""Packet"" price bracket which costs £2.70. That's over twice as expensive as a Large Letter, costing £1.20. Even second class is expensive at £2.20.

This pricing basically makes listing lots of low value items totally uneconomical, yet there are people listing items identical to what I have for sale while charging less than £2.20 for the total listing. So either they are total mugs or they know something I don't.

Is there a smarter way to go about this other than using Royal Mails' rip off [Price Finder](http://www.royalmail.com/price-finder)? Can you buy stamps and make up the value to the specific cost it would be in relation to the weight and size of your item? If so, how would one go about calculating this? Or is this 25mm thing an insurmountable barrier?",3,1,2012-08-02,EBAY,0.036599256098270416,0.928615152835846,0.03478561341762543

Ebay,What's the worst that can happen if I don't go through with a sale?,"Hi there gang - I'm in a pickle and just feel too suspicious of the winning bidder.

I was selling a smartphone to the UK only.  I had 11 sweet watchers so I was hopeful I'd at least get my asking price.  Turns out one person made two bids seconds before the end of the bid and won it but he has zero feedback and the account was made four days before.

I forgot to write no low feedback bidders.  He paid almost instantly on Paypal.  I contacted him to say I was a bit apprehensive about sending him an expensive phone and would be open to a face to face since we both are outside of London.  He said he'd prefer it be shipped.  After saying I was not comfortable with that, he said he would wait 5 days and then go to eBay.  

What's the worst that could happen?  I would refund his money on paypal and just not do anything further with the transaction.  I am fine with getting a bad feedback but I'm afraid eBay could come after me.  I guess I can even be ok with paying the transaction fee, that hurts less than being out the amount of the phone.

UPDATE: He says he would be willing to meet and exchange in London today - he knows I'm not that close that I can just get up and go within a day.  This news does make me feel better as I would be willing to meet with him.  But even then couldn't he still try the same scam through eBay?  Say he never got anything (because how can I prove to eBay that we met and how could he not prove that we didn't?)

Ebay,Problem with seller,"**tl;dr** Tried to buy item, seller cancelled because of ""Feedback Issues"". I've never bought anything by bidding on eBay before and therefore have never left/gotten any feedback, so I think that's why. Can't contact seller. Any suggestions?

I've barely used eBay before. The two times I have, I used the ""Buy it Now"" feature. I've never bid on anything before, so I wasn't really sure how it worked. I found an item that I wanted.

I placed the minimum bid that it automatically recommends, it told me I didn't bid enough, so I did until I got the highest bid. I had to bid several times. I got outbid again a little later, and went online to place another bid. When I tried to, it said I could no longer place bids on that item, but didn't give a reason. 

Since I've never done a bidding thing on eBay, for some reason I assumed you were only allowed a certain number of bids per item. I created another eBay account using my other email and linked it to the same PayPal account of my first eBay account. I didn't see anything wrong with doing this since I just wanted to buy something.

I successfully placed a winning bid with the new account. A few minutes later I got an email saying my bid was removed by the seller and that I could see the reason on the bid history link. I had no idea that link existed before the email told me. I checked it out and saw that my bids on my first account were cancelled because of ""Feedback Issues"", which is very vague, the seller provided no other information. My bids on the new account were cancelled because the seller saw it was me again.

I tried to find a way to contact the seller, but there wasn't a way. He apparently doesn't allow you to send him questions under the ""Contact Member"" section. I'm just trying to find out what happened and it seems you can't just contact someone on eBay. Any suggestions?

**Update:** Yes, a seller absolutely can cancel your bids and block you because you have 0 feedback, even if you've never bid on anything in your 3 year account history. I made the customer service lady repeat what she said, then I repeated it back to her to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the policy.

**Update on the Update** I posted a message to the eBay Discussion Board. I don't expect anything to come from it but I thought I would share:  [eBay Discussion Board](http://forums.ebay.com/db1/topic/New-To-Ebay/New-User-Not/5100094626).

Ebay,"Buyer claims to have used Paypal ""Guest Checkout"", but I can't see any pending balance","After selling an item today, the buyer didn't immediately pay, so ebay told me ""You're waiting for payment for 1 item."" The buyer updated the payment status to ""Payment sent"", but I still hadn't received anything in Paypal, so I PMd the buyer.

He responded, saying that he used ""Guest Checkout"" on Paypal, and that Paypal is now holding the funds until I provide a valid tracking number, at which point the funds will be released into my Paypal account.

Now, I have no intention of sending anything until I see pending payment in Paypal, but where do I go from here? I messaged the buyer once more, and he said that the money has already been pulled from his bank account, and is being held until I provide a tracking number.

I have no experience with ""Guest Checkout"", so I don't know how it works, but I find it very hard to believe that it would involve me shipping before seeing any kind of pending balance within Paypal.

Is this guy trying to screw me over, or am I just misunderstanding the situation?

What's my next step?""","[Original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/xhjl4/help_think_im_about_to_get_screwed_by_a_notorious/)WELP! I waited for her to pay for five days, opened an unpaid item reminder. Finally on Sunday evening she paid, but left a message asking me to ship it to a different and unconfirmed address. If I could not ship it to this new address (and deceptively similar) she requested I refund her money until she could change her addresses. Quickly refunded her money stating that we could not ship to an unconfirmed address and that she would have to change it in both Ebay and Paypal. The next day I sent a polite message stating that I would like to cancel this transaction as there have been just too many snags so far. Well she denied my request and left me negative feedback calling me a sneaky seller, that I didn't communicate, blah blah blah. 

It's very upsetting as I work really hard on being a fantastic seller and take my customer satisfaction very seriously. It sucks that I now have less that 100% positive feedback when I've been absolutely professional as a seller. I wrote her another message apologizing again for the debacle and asking if she would reconsider the feedback left as it would negatively effect my business. She wrote back saying she would only if I sent her the dress (which is not going to happen). 

I called Ebay to try and get the feedback taken off and get the final value fee back. They gave the final value fee back, but said there was nothing they could do about the negative feedback. I finally referenced the scam artist website (which in hindsight I should have done from the get go) to Ebay customer service and they sent it to the fraud department. It really sucks that there are scam artists out there that abuse the system, without being reprimanded or brought to justice. 

Thanks for reading my rant and letting me vent, didn't sleep much because of this. Ebay is my main source of income besides odd jobs I can pick up here and there, and this just really sucks :(

Ebay,Scammed by buyer - is there anything I can do?,"So here is the deal, my family collects these ceramic figurines, occasionally we sell them off on eBay. We always make sure that the figues are well packed because they are very fragile. Recently we shipped a figurine to a buyer; when she got it she claimed that it was badly packed and that it broke during shipment. She automatically got a refund from eBay because, as expected, ebay always sides with the buyer. After days of sending her emails we finally convinced her return the broken figurine. 

When we received the figure, it was obvious that she dropped it herself after getting it, it was not the type of damage that would occur from shipping damage. Since ebay already solved the dispute in her favor, we couldn't really do anything other than collect on the insurance we paid for it. Here's the thing though, in order for shipping to pay out on the insurance, the buyer has to confirm that the item was broken when he or she received it. And here is the ridiculous part - the buyer claimed that it wasn't broken when she received it! 

What can we do now? Ebay refuses to overturn the case even though it is clear the buyer outright lied about the figure being broken.

Now I have relisted the item as bid only. Everything went okay for the first couple of days but then I got a fraudulent bidder. $600-$800-$999, I believe he was looking for my reserve. So I banned the bidder and canceled his bids.

I will be out my 4Gb of RAM plus eBay and shipping fees. I will probably get negative feedback. He will roam free.

**Too Long; Will Read Anyway**

So I was selling my MacBook Pro RAM on eBay, EXACTLY as described. Tested before being shipped out.

[Original auction](http://www.ebay.com/itm/271018133387?ssPageName=STRK:MESOX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1562.l2649#ht_500wt_1219)

[Buyer](http://myworld.ebay.com/garycraft2012/) wins, pays the $11 or so. Noticed the seller's actual name in the shipping address was a little suspicious but I was trying not to be ""racist"", prejudice or judgmental. I was foolish not to research him since his feedback was **100% (129)**; Didn't think it was really possible to be scammed as a seller; ignorance is bliss. As per the subreddit rules, I guess I'm not allowed to post it his personal name or info?

Anyways, I ship off the item with tracking via USPS to the US address he provided. Arrives. No +feedback received. Just woke up this morning to a PayPal dispute. Seller claims that the item was damaged, wants a refund. A [quick Google search](http://blog.collins.net.pr/2011/08/when-did-ebay-remove-rights-to-leave.html) reveals that he is a scam artist operating out of China with a forwarding facility in CA. I guess he gets things shipped to a CA address and then forwards them to HK, then asks for a refund and I'm assuming keeps the item or sends you back a fake one or something of lesser value than what you sent him.

[Blog post all about this scam artist.](http://blog.collins.net.pr/2011/08/when-did-ebay-remove-rights-to-leave.html)

VERY informative. Note that his eBay ID [**garycraft2012**](http://myworld.ebay.com/garycraft2012/) name and shipping address all match with prior sellers' experience with this scammer AND mine (I will post a screenshot of his information if the moderators allow me to since this ""personal"" information isn't really all that personal when you're a scam artist with a fake name and address that really needs to be brought to attention). Compare the winning bidder ID in my auction link above to the one(s) mentioned in the blog post.

This is the first time I've been scammed and I'm usually VERY careful with this kind of stuff (mostly from online stores, not so much eBay sellers) but I guess there's a first time for everything. Pretty embarrassed, actually.

From past sellers' experiences, both eBay and PayPal always 100% side with the seller. So I will be:

* Out my eBay fees
* Out my shipping fees 
* Out my time
* I will probably receive negative feedback

While this guy is:

* Up 4Gb of RAM
* Free to roam scamming everybody else

Truthfully, the one thing I'm worried about is tarnishing my eBay Feedback which is currently **100% (46)**. It's silly but I want sellers and buyers to know I'm legitimate so I'm pretty frustrated that my ~5 years on eBay is about to be tarnished by some Chinese scam artist. There's also a lot of holes in this case because:

* There's no proof that I shipped a working item (which I did)
* There's no proof that whatever he ships back to me will be my original RAM (which it probably won't be) and then once PayPal gets that return tracking number. I'm out.

Hardly seems worth it for $11 of RAM but I just want this guy brought to justice. But at the same time, I wouldn't mind breaking even (not having any losses from this troll).

So my questions are:

* Is there anything eBay can do to stop this guy? Report?
* "" "" PayPal?
* I probably won't receive my RAM back, how do I recover from this (minor) loss? Is there an eBay *SELLER* protection?
* How do I go about this?
* If he leaves negative feedback, can I get it removed?

Thanks for your guys' input.",4,1,2012-08-09,EBAY,0.2644858956336975,0.7148895859718323,0.02062450535595417
Ebay,Other business sellers let me know what you think.,"I am a UK seller, woman pays for a bracelet on Jun 2, she lives on the east coast of USA. 

She then contacts me on Jun 13 saying she hasn't recevied it, as we had the queens Jubilee at this time and I posted on a weekend I thought there was a strong possibility it was just late because there was about 5 non working days during this period.
I just checked my email to her again and it says Please contact me again if it doesn't arrive.

She then messages me today August 9th. Saying that she ""went out of town for 1.5 months and never recevied it, that's why I didn't contact you"".

So 2 months after she pays she has decided to contact me. Is she still able to leave me negative feedback after this long?

I found the following on the ebay website which doesn't tell me.

Members must leave Feedback within 60 days of the transaction closing (today, members have up to 90 days).

Ebay,"Selling my gaming computer and getting paid via PayPal - is it safe?
SORRY IF IT'S IN THE WRONG SUBREDDIT","Hello, 

First, I would like to apologize if this was the wrong subreddit to post in. I feel that this subreddit could help me the most.

I posted an ad on Craigslist for my gaming computer and have gotten two people interested in it. The problem is that they are not local and want me to ship it to them. I'm not sure if these people are legit. Here are the e-mails sent to me. (Beware of horrible English)

Buyer 1:
&gt;Thanks for your mail,what is the conditions of it?i am buying the item
for my cousin who work in oversea.i will add $50 for taking down the
add and $100 for shipping,i would have done it local transaction but i
am out of town presently...you can get back to me with your PayPal
email account so i can pay now,and if you don't have one,you can log
on to their website WWW.PayPal.com to create an account with them and
get back to me with only your PayPal email address so that i can remit
payment into your account. Hope to hear from you soon best regard.

&gt;I insisted on PayPal because i don't have access to my bank account online as i don't have internet banking,but i can pay from my PayPal account,as i have my bank a/c attached to it,i will need you to give me your PayPal email address and the price so i can make the payments asap for it and pls if you don't have PayPal account yet, it is very easy to set up, go to http://www.paypal.com/us and get it set up, after you have set it up i will only need the e-mail address you use for registration with PayPal so as to put the money through

Buyer 2:
I asked for his phone number and realized it wasn't in my area.

&gt;I live in Minnesota because of my business and also lived in Vancouver 
 because of my Family...you not gonna ship it to anywhere, my dispatcher is 
 taking it from you. Okay???Thanks for your understanding,

What should I do? Can they send me the money via paypal and then take it back? Sort of like a 30 day return policy of some sort?

Ebay,"Update #4: ""Help! Think I'm about to get screwed by a notorious Ebay scammer. What's my next step?""","Holy crap! Just when my anxiety about the situation subsided and negative feedback was taken off, I get back from work today to find this message from the buyer:

""are you really that stupid &amp; gullable to believe everything you read. 
I reported you to ebay so im sure you will here from them. I was about to agree to remove the feedback but then I see you left me a negt remark. Now you can go F*!ck yourself""

Which I will ignore. But then I see that she has bought a buy-it-now item I have with another account she created with the same shipping address, nearly the exact same ebay name hippie-fashion and the nearly the same email H****H****@gunnesaxshop.com. 

At this point I'm feeling harassed, and really hate that she has my home address. I'm charging my phone up right now to call Ebay, again, for the fourth day in a row to try to take care of this.

EDIT: Okay, I guess it's only been update #3, wrote this while kinda stressed out. Talked to Ebay, they have linked the two accounts and know that she bought the item for the purpose of leaving negative feedback. They said the transaction will be cancelled and something with her account is happening so that she cannot leave negative feedback (I'm assuming it's being suspended).

I've used the internet for a long time but never sold anything on ebay :0

I am wanting to list some RAM, a hard drive, and a couple of CD / CDRW drives.

I'd like to hit at least £5 for each item otherwise it seems a little pointless selling them

My question is should I put a reserve price of £5 them (which means I get charged a listing fee) or would I be best to just start them off at 99p

[EDIT: Damn, it won't let me pay by credit card since my email is already linked to a paypal account -.- So I just logged in and paid via PayPal, even though my bank was unverified and I had no funds in PayPal. Whats gives??]

Also- I want my bank to be the backup funding source so I don't need to transfer money into my PayPal account. How do I do this? Can I do this after I verify? How long does it take? Are there any disadvantages of doing this? (Apart from putting in credit card info)

Ebay,PSA: Seller lists auction item with free shipping. I win with $2.01 bid.  Shipping cost is $9.00 via USPS Parcel Post.,"I believe the shipping rate would have been a bit less via UPS for her, and that would have included ""free"" insurance up to $100.  

I feel badly that this seller took a hit on this, but I relay this here as an object lesson on not doing one's homework when creating a listing.

The item in question really was worth no more than ~$2.00 but if you offer free shipping, please be aware that while it *may* increase your page views and bids, you need to know the item's real value and the shipping costs in advance, otherwise you will get burned.

Ebay,"I want to save your top rated seller status.
There is a change to the requirements that they aren't explaining.","Recently, eBay added a shipping requirement to the top rated seller program.
When I read about it, I didn't see any significant issues with the policy.
So as my company continued with selling, I saw my shipping percentage go down slowly.
I got after the shipping team and was watching exactly what they were doing.
Everyday, the tracking got uploaded as required but the percentage still continued to drop.
I made several calls to eBay trying to figure out what was going wrong.
They had no answer.
After the first month they put it in place, I lost my Top Rated sellers status with a percentage of 89.93% in the shipping requirement.
When they did the evaluations they put out the first report on which of your shipments counted against you.
I discovered that every time I ship out a second package to a customer for whatever reason, it counts the second shipment as the date that the shipment was sent.
If my customers need an exchange, or ask for an extra battery or other accessory, It counts against my shipping requirement for top rated seller status.
This information is nowhere in any of the documentation.
After making the discovery, I contacted eBay and they said they didn't talk about it because it was a way for them to stop people from getting around the requirement.(putting in fake tracking info and shipping the package late)
So to get around this, we are forced to ship all of our secondary packages outside of eBay and PayPal to keep our shipping requirements where they need to be.
I really wish it wasn't like this, it takes more time and effects our ability to help customers.
I hope some of you can read this and make adjustments to your process to avoid the loss of your top rated seller status.

TL;DR
eBay will ping your shipping requirement if you send out follow up packages to customers and you can lose your top rated seller status. In order to avoid, ship all secondary packages outside of eBay so you can still have good customer service and top rated seller status.",10,14,2012-08-17,EBAY,0.07084483653306961,0.8926277756690979,0.03652738779783249

Ebay,Issues w eBay due to buyer protection,"My dad passed away at the end of last year, which left me with a TON of drag race and hot rod parts that I have been selling piecemeal over the last few months. I sold a part approx. 2 months ago that the owner was not happy with (it had some damage that I wasn't aware of).  When the buyer initially contacted me, I told him to give me a few days to get back with him, as I was in the middle of moving.  The buyer didn't give me this time (I had limited internet access) appealed to eBay, who emailed me and said they were having the part sent back to me and I would be responsible for refunding the money.

Up to here I have no issues, and would of happily refunded the money once I got the return.  The part sold WAY below value, I was going to have the repairs done on it when I got it back, and basically double what it sold for originally.

The buyer, who was aware I had moved, then shipped the item to my prior address.  Once he forwarded his delivery receipt to ebay, they tried to draw the money out of my card, which due to my move, was no longer valid in their computer (thankfully).

I didn't receive the part, the part was NOT at my old address when I tried to run by to see if it was left outside, so I'm fairly sure it is lost for good.

I appealed the original decision, ebay almost instantly denied it.  I've emailed support, with no reply of any kind beyond the 'we will get in touch ASAP.'  eBay is now threatening to send it to a collection agency.  I've lost access to my 100% account (I sold 3 cars and probably 15+ parts from my Dad's collection) and ebay is ignoring all my emails.

What can I do at this point?  I'd like my account back, but I am not paying for an item I did not receive.  Honestly I feel the buyer is in the wrong here, as he shipped to my old address, even though he was made aware of the fact I had moved.

Ebay,CNC Spindle Seller : Pack of problems,"Right, I have been reading /r/ebay for a while ( 1 - 2 months ) now. 

I hope that I have posted this correctly - First time posting a new thread anywhere on Reddit.

Near the start of august I bought a 1.5 Kw Spindle and VFD off Ebay. ( Big old motor and a power supply basically ) for around £200. This was about 140 for the item and 50 for the postage. 

It was a seller over in china, but dispatching from the UK. 

So my package arrives and the motor ( The motor is worth about 140/ 200 ish does not rotate at all. ) its DOA. The VFD is working, I get onto the seller asking why.. I follow instructions for checking its set up properly, however when i cannot rotate a part that is meant to be free moving even with a wrench - Its broken!  

Equally, the water in out ports on it look to have limescale deposits in, I think they sent me a used part. ( More so than just a factory test as claimed, plus abrasions on the spindle itself )

After making a video proving its this way and having extensive correspondence with this broken English speaking seller, I get authorization to return.  

I did not send it off until i had his word that he would pay for the return ( through the ebay message channel )  - We even offered to drive it down to the depo to get a swap free of any postage reimbursement however this was not allowed. 

( Sent tracked and insured with huge amounts of photographic proof of sending and item condition ) 

It is now 3/4 through august and the tracking is now saying  ""Redelivery scheduled"" ""Addressee requested later delivery"" ( It should be noted that this is a warehouse  )  

I am just left really angry, Some back story about me, i buy a lot from Ebay, and i have only had about 5 problems / 500 transactions. I am normally an easy going guy and like that i can get industrial parts off ebay. 

I personally believe he was a seller trying to test his luck by shipping a defective unit, or just from a factory paying poor quality control, however i am now hugely down on the time that i should have had to be using this item and cant help feel i am being taken for a ride because i still do not have confirmation of him sending a replacement yet, 

It should also be noted that upon arrival there was HUGE stress put on not opening disputes through paypal by the seller in A4 pages inside the shipping box - making me think that this has happened before. 

I have given him an ultimatum to give me a tracking number for my return part by tuesday 21 or face paypal / ebay. 

I ask of you /r/ebay for advice !

EDIT :

I got a reply today from the guy saying 
""Once our Uk warehouse receive the item, we will send you a new one and refund you the return shipping cost together, is that ok?"" - But as we have seen they are the ones delaying the return of the item.

Is there any steps to take besides confronting him and then leaving negative feedback?

This is a first for me on ebay. 

I won an auction on August 14th and paid promptly. The seller bought a shipping level but never actually shipped the item (confirmed from tracking number). 

On the 17th he sends me a paypal refund saying USPS issued him an insurance check because item was stolen or lost, and says he only had 1 item so he can't give me a replacement.

I call USPS and they say you have to wait at least 21 days before filing an insurance claim that an mailed item is missing (LIE #1).

I see a craigslist listing dated 8/19 that a guy is selling the same item I won. Because he also is trying to sell a 2nd item that the ebay user was trying to sell, I am sure it is him (LIE #2)

I'd like to call ebay because this is a unique situation but it seems they are off the grid.

I screen-shotted all the proof, although because he gave me a refund I feel there isn't much I can do in terms of actually getting this item.

Is there anything I should do besides confronting the seller and leaving neg feedback if he doesn't sell?

Ebay,Selling an iPhone 3GS for spares and repairs [Advice wanted],"Hi /r/ebay

After some careful thought and reseach it appears that I could make more money, selling my 16GB iPhone 3GS for spares and repairs. 

Mazuma Mobile recycling company are offering me £35 where as other people on ebay are selling a similar item for between £50 and £80

As far as I can tell the phone just needs a new battery. Before it stopped charging it was only staying charged for 10 minutes at a time, now it doesn't turn on when I plug it in.

Has anyone got any specific advice for selling this item? Should I create a buy it now, or would I be best of creating an auction with a reserve of £50?

Anything else I should consider when listing this item? I feel a bit guilty listing a broken item (even though I know it is well with in the ebay rules)

Ebay,"Bought a car, seller trying to cancel - advice please","I received a second chance offer on a car, which I accepted.  Rather than allow for an Ebay checkout, I was directed to contact seller to arrange payment (as per ebay motors guidelines according to customer service).  I won the car late 8/15, and made immediate contact with seller.  Seller requested multiple times that all payment be handled via paypal, despite my mentioning limits and possible fees for him.  But, I'm just the buyer, I have cash, I don't really care.  Instant transfer of the max allowed coupled with a Paypal e-check were sent as soon as the seller gave me his info.  Car was put up on uship, auction ended, and I chose a shipper.  Constant (mostly texting) contact with seller throughout.  Yesterday in a two-hour time span we went from discussing title and pickup information to the seller texting to tell me he received an email from Ebay that the purchase was not completed through ebay checkout and therefore not covered.  He initiated a cancellation.  

I called Ebay and spoke with a very nice CSR regarding the issue.  She assured me that all was legit, that I am the winning bidder, etc.  I of course did not receive the email that the seller says they received.  When I reviewed cancellation info, there was a warning not to cancel until I had received a refund.  The instant transfer was complete and the e-check is scheduled to clear tomorrow.  I declined cancellation with a message stating ""	

Ebay checkout is not available through ebay motors per phone call with Leah in Ebay customer service.
I prefer to continue with purchase, but will not accept cancellation until refund is received.""

My phone decided to die last night and I had not received any text messages since suggesting the seller contact ebay support for clarification.  I emailed him today to see if he had done so and to inform him that my phone is out of commission so if he had texted, I have not received anything.  The email I received back:  ""U are going to have to cancel and ask for a refund casue now that u declined i dont get the final buyers credit  thats like 170.00"".  

I think he figured out that his choice of paypal was going to cost him a bit more than he bargained for, either through withdrawal limits or fees and is trying to back out.  I have not called off the shippers, nor have I received a voicemail from them.  What are my rights (if any)? Twice in ebay messages I offered to pay the deposit via paypal and the remainder via certified funds.  That offer was declined.

Ebay,Water Damaged Item,"I sold a signed book to a gentleman and shipped it out last week. It was wrapped very well in bubble wrap and then placed in a plastic mailing envelope that should have been fairly waterproof. The guy sent me a message and said that the book was water damaged to the point that the bookplate sticker that was signed inside had come off. I don't think it could have been water damaged anywhere on my end, so it had to have been left in the open somewhere on his end. I did a google maps search of his house and it shows that he lives on a farm, so I'm guessing he has a mailbox by the road and it didn't fit so the mailman left it out and it rained.

Ebay,"I'm in the US, the laptop I bought was broken - Now eBay tells me to send it back to Germany when the ad states item was located in California, and the package I received was from California, what do I do?","I bought a used gaming laptop on eBay for $570.  The auction stated it was in mint condition, and that the item location was in California. CA.  I received the package a week later, from an address in San Francisco, and the laptop was completely dead on arrival.  It not only doesn't work correctly, it does not show even the slightest sign of life when I try to turn it on.  It also doesn't come with the driver CD's that it said it would come with in the ad.  The seller even made all his feedback private immediately after the item was sold - it was weird.

I tried to contact the seller, and received no response.  I opened up a case with eBay's resolution center, they judged in my favor, opting to give me a full refund when I return the item to the seller.  The address they gave me to return it to is in Germany, and because its value is over $250, I need signature confirmation.  This would cost over $200 to send and get the confirmation through either FedEx or UPS, and I don't even think that is where the seller is currently located.  Plus, I never would have bought a laptop from out of the country in the first place.

I replied to the e-mail from customer service I received explaining this, and haven't received a response (I just sent it, so its not like I expected to hear back from them already).  So basically, my question is:  what should I do from here?  

I don't think I'm willing to spend that much money to risk sending it to another country, because: 
a) I have no guarantee that I will ever get a signature confirmation I need
b) the $200 would probably be better spent getting the broken laptop repaired.

So, where do I go from here?  Am i screwed?  I would be so appreciative of any advice!  Thanks!

Sold a game.  Lady gets it, says it doesn't work.

So instead of getting her money back by tomorrow at the soonest, she selects the option were the only difference is where she will get it back in a few days.  And I am sure I will get negative feedback for this.

Ebay,I'm pretty sure the sale was illegal,"I recently ordered a text book on half.com. The student edition was advertised. I made sure the ISBN numbers matched.

I contacted the seller and was told to return the book. They never addressed the issue that this book was sold illegally, nor that their company had tried to hide the fact with electrical tape. 

They also used the student edition ISBN number in their posting, not the Instructor edition.

Ebay,How to make EBay 100% better.,"Create an option that when an item is bid on in the last couple minutes of an auction, the auction time is extended by another couple minutes. I think it does a few things successfully:

1. Many auction items would finish at a higher dollar amount. This makes ebay more money. This makes the seller more money.

2. The item ends at a dollar amount more closely resembling its value because rather than time running out, people stop bidding because the item just isn't worth more.

3. It counteracts the annoying strategy of ""sniping"" bids at the last minute. ""Sniping"" is a fair and no-brainer strategy right now, but I think with this new option for sellers to activate it levels the playing field for all potential bidders, allowing reaction time to new bids.

Ebay,How to make eBay 100% better [fixed],"Offer a Buy-it-now where the price starts high and slowly ticks down until the item is sold.   Example.   Seller starts item at $100 and instructs eBay the minimum sell price is $40 and the duration is 7 days.   

Daily it would look like this:

day 1	$100 
day 2	$90 
day 3	$80 
day 4	$70 
day 5	$60 
day 6	$50 
day 7	$40 
with small drops every minute which cause the $10 per day drop.

Buyers know the longer they wait to buy, the cheaper the price, but also the greater chance another buyer will steal away the item.


This would just be one selling option for eBay and all other selling options would remain the same.  So if a seller doesn't like it, then they wouldn't use it.

Ebay,Help. Ebay gave me terrible advice and I canceled 14 bids but my MacBook Pro still sold and the buyer rejected my request to cancel the sale.,"There was a discrepancy in my MacBook Pro listing that I did not realize until it was too late to change. After rejecting my request to cancel the auction after I canceled 14 bids, this is what I sent to the buyer:

I am terribly sorry for the confusion but the sale price was $130 less than it was last night and plan to relist the item. After realizing the graphics card discrepancy with no time to edit the listing, ebay advised me to cancel all bids and then cancel the auction. I successfully cancelled the bids however was not able to cancel the auction as it was within 12 hours of the auction end (something the rep should've known). I contacted ebay again and was advised to just cancel the bids as they come in, which I did as well. I mentioned that I was afraid of not being able to cancel last second bids and was assured that I would have a buffer to do so. Obviously this was not the case and too many people sniped the item at the end and whatever ""buffer"" the ebay representative spoke of was clearly not enough. Again, I apologize and I feel horrible for how it went. Please refrain from leaving negative feedback as I was caught in a mess that ebay clearly provided poor advice on resolving.

Buyers response:
OK , here is how it is from my point of view, I made a serious offer, I have the Cash in PayPal, I wNt the computer... i will add the 130 and match last nights price, I stillI want it ,, I note that five people were  still there bidding.. as for my self I did not use auction sniper, just made the bid, 
i am high bid, I want the computer. There is no need to invole  eBay at this point, I sincerly hope it works out the way Id like it to... from my point of view I have done nothng wrong, I have acted in the guidelines established by E bay.,And I am willing to add the 130$. To the price, Even Tho , I am not required to do so .... I have to leave soon so I may not be able to read your responce right away ... I hope your not just simply trying to jack up the price... I sell like you do, I buy like you do, I remain hopeing this can be settled amicably , Terry Howard ,
Of howardbooks in flagler neach florida...

And my subsequent response, which I have yet to hear back.
I can see your point of view, however I can assure you I am in no way shape or form trying to unfairly jack up the price. I just want to list the item fairly and receive a fair price for it. Neither of these things happened in my opinion. Since the item was listed incorrectly and I was unable to modify it, I did not want someone to receive something worse than they thought they purchased. As a seller, I'm sure you can sympathize. I listened to ebay's advice on how to resolve it and they really put me in a compromised position. The computer only had a handful of bids last night however there were 60+ watchers, which means there was significant interest. I cancelled 14 bids in the process and 5 more bids came through at the end. That said, the sale price would certainly ended up more than the price it was last night. Please understand that I did all of this according to ebay's advice. In retrospect, I should never have canceled the 14 bids and just explained the situation at the end with a much higher end price. As a seller, I ask of you to please be reasonable and understand that this item is severely undervalued as a result of ebay's direct advice. In the end, I hope you can understand that relisting the item is the fairest thing to do and hope that you agree and don't leave negative feedback. My buy it now was 1499 and believe the auction would have ended fairly close to that

Ok, that's all of it. Is this something that I should just bite the bullet on or risk my 100% feedback on? Would love some advice. Thanks!",20,2,2012-08-29,EBAY,0.11336743831634521,0.86136794090271,0.025264635682106018

Ebay,How do local buyer pick ups work?,"I recently sold an item on Ebay and I did allow local buyers to pick up the item. When the person bought the item he informed me that he is going to come over and pick up the item, which is fine. He paid me through Paypal for the item and is coming to pick up the item tomorrow.

My question is do I mark the item as shipped since he paid and is coming tomorrow to get it? Or do I need to inform Ebay through something else?

Edit* This buyer has 0 feedback and has already paid via paypal, I'm worried about being scammed and the buyer issuing a chargeback once they get the item. Is there any way I can get proof that they picked up the item so I won't get scammed?

Ebay,Dispute with buy regarding scratches. Please advise.,"Hi /r/eBay I would love to hear all your opinions on this.

**Firstly**

I sold an iPhone 3GS for spares and repairs and it sold for £80

When I listed the item I listed

* Apple iPhone 3GS 16 GB handset in good condition with a few light / minor scratches on the body

The buyer now has the item but isn't happy and say the item has cracks in it and that I should of been more up front and genuine with what I listed

[You can see pictures here that he sent me](http://imgur.com/a/N2t6r#0)

I referred to the items in the picture as scratches as the do not affect the operation of the phone.

What are your thoughts /r/eBay?

**Secondly**

As a resolution this is what the buyer is suggestion

""would you consider a donation to my charity event, equivalent to the cost of a replacement screen (about £20)?  The link to the half marathon for the Kidney Wales""

/r/eBay is this an acceptable resolution or could I get scammed when he changes his mind after I make the donation?

I'm not really happy with this resolution as I did list the item as being scratched and also as a 'spares and repairs' model. 

As I mention above the scratches don't affect the operation of the handset in anyway.

**Finally** 

If you want to see the full listing please PM me and I will send you a link, I'm not allowed to directly link it on this board. (Or is that OK to do once the sale has finished?)

Thank you for all your help in advance :)",15,0,2012-08-30,EBAY,0.02067706361413002,0.9226416349411011,0.056681256741285324

Ebay,"Selling iTunes Gift Cards on eBay, international buyers, and unconfirmed Paypal addresses","Just had my first experience selling a gift card on eBay. Before selling, I read this and [this](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/gift.html) about how it's against eBay's policies to send a gift card code through email. Also, I've read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/waju8/why_do_gift_cards_go_for_more_than_face_value/) about selling gift cards on eBay. 

Well, I've just sold an iTunes gift card. It sold buy it now to a buyer who immediately paid via Paypal and the buyer asked for just the code through email even though I've said free shipping in my auction. That was the first red flag. Buyer has an unconfirmed Paypal address in Hawaii and an eBay address of Brazil. This is the second red flag. I've kindly emailed the buyer and told him about eBay's policies and linked him to policy stating it's not okay to send gift cards electronically. I've also kindly asked for him to confirm his Hawaii address so I can ship the item. My auction clearly stated that it will be shipped and not delivered electronically. 

My questions:

1. Am I correct by only wanting to ship to a confirmed address given the discrepancy between the unconfirmed Paypal shipping address in Hawaii and the eBay address in Brazil? 

2.  If the buyer says it's okay that I ship it, am I covered by eBay's seller protection if I ship this to an unconfirmed address? The Paypal payment says that it's eligible for seller protection if sent to this unconfirmed address. Does that mean I'll be covered if the buyer opens a ""not described"" or a ""not received"" case even though his eBay address is in Brazil? I haven't had a buyer with an unconfirmed Paypal address in over 6 months and I just want to make sure I'm covered. 

Thank you in advance. 

edit: The eBay buyer has been a member since Feb 2011, has 11 positives (all pos.) and has left all positives for his sellers. The only thing that could be off is that the buyer hasn't received a positive feedback since January 2012 - probably not fishy, just thought I'd throw that in there.",1,0,2012-08-31,EBAY,0.022927619516849518,0.9146303534507751,0.06244209036231041
