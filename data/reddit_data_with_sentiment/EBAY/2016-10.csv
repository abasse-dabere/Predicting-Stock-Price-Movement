Ebay,Sold an item. The seller got a refund despite admitting they DID receive it.,"So I sold an item. The buyer filed a claim for a refund claiming they hadn't received it, then messaged me photos of the item - they had smashed it. I know it wasn't possible for it to be smashed during delivery as this is NOT my first rodeo and I had actually paid extra for its shipping cos I had put it in a good box filled with bubble wrap and paper. The buyer got a full refund on the basis of not receiving it. 

So now I'm out the item, the money for the item AND the extra money I paid for shipping. And some scammer has their money back. 

Is there ANYTHING I can do? I've filed an appeal with ebay but I'm not confident of it getting me anywhere considering they had no problem giving this scammer their money back. 

I'm pretty gutted about this. Not just cos of the money - it wasn't a LOT of money - but that was a Royal Doulton teapot I'd had for years and I thought I was sending it off to someone who would treasure it. The photos of it smashed to pieces really hurt. It was if they were  gloating about destroying something beautiful.",14,11,2016-10-01,EBAY,0.0549192875623703,0.8965874910354614,0.048493195325136185

Ebay,Basic vs Premium store - listing visibility difference?,"I see some stores with 10k+ feedback that have their item at the top of the ""best match"" search no matter what. I'm assuming they *also* have more than a basic store considering the sheer volume of listings they have active (500-4000) however I'm still building and have a basic store. 

I realise several things matter with search visibility but I'm curious if Premium Stores get a visibility bump over Basic Stores?

So far the basic to premium upgrade isn't worth it but for a visibility bump.. it's a lot more interesting, I just can't find any information about this and I know eBay will just say ""yeah, yeah do it - do it now let me sign you up!!!""",2,4,2016-10-01,EBAY,0.017895467579364777,0.9057291746139526,0.07637543976306915
Ebay,"As a buyer, does a UPS damage claim and return affect my rights under eBay's Money Back Guarantee?","Hi fellow Redditors,

I’d like to ask your advice about a recent eBay purchase.  I purchased an expensive new item on eBay but when it arrived, the box had a significant dent on the side, and the item was damaged.  I immediately used eBay’s messaging system to let the seller know along with photos of the box and item.  The seller asked me to contact UPS to file a claim, which I did and am waiting on UPS to schedule an inspection.  I asked for advice on the /r/ups thread, and it looks like UPS will come pick up the package, inspect it at their location, and send it back to the shipper.

The seller has offered to repair the item and ship it back to me.  I am on the fence about this because the item may not be repaired in the manner I want and that would mean in the end I purchased a repaired item and not a new one.

If I choose to not take up the repair offer and ask for a full refund under eBay's Money Back Guarantee, how does the UPS damage claim affect this?  I was thinking it would go something like this:

1) UPS has taken the package for damage inspection, and is sending the package back to the seller.
2) I inform the seller that I am not comfortable with a repair and would like a full refund instead under eBay's Money Back Guarantee.  This trumps the eBay listing saying ""no returns"".
3) I file a ""not as described"" claim for the item, saying item damaged in shipping.  I haven't done this before, but I assume eBay will ask me to ship it back and print a return label or enter a tracking number.  But here's where I am not sure of the complication ... UPS is already taking the item back as part of the damage claim.  I don't need a return label and not sure if UPS will give a new tracking number as part of the damage claim return.
My question is, does having the package returned to the seller as part of the UPS damage claim affect my ability to get a full refund under eBay's Money Back Guarantee?

Thanks for any help!",6,4,2016-10-01,EBAY,0.045684635639190674,0.9137303829193115,0.04058494418859482

Ebay,Chances of eBay siding with me?,"Okay - another tale of a lying buyer.

I sold an Apple Watch on eBay for a good price. It was sent same day and arrived the next by registered mail. It was in pristine condition. 

Ten days later (yesterday) I received an email from the buyer saying ""I would like to return this please. Not what I wanted."" No indication there that anything was wrong - just a case of buyer's remorse. I replied and said that I was unable to offer a return as per the original listing.

The buyer has now opened a claim saying that the unit was faulty. I have replied again and stated that I will not be refunding him as he has had 10 days with the item. If you had spent £200 on a faulty item from eBay you would already have complained. I reminded him that his previous email to me did not mention any fault - just that it was not what he wanted. If it was faulty you would have mentioned it then. Finally, the item was sold with 10 months of AppleCare+ remaining so I pointed him there for support directly from Apple.

Based on his first email to me saying that he didn't want it, do you think eBay will side with him? 

The email I received from eBay letting me know a claim had been opened stated ""You can ask us to step in and help if there's a problem with the buyer's request."" How do I do this? I can't see an option to raise a counter claim against the buyer.

If it matters or not, the buyer is clearly quite experienced with eBay as he has a score of over 850. Mine is around 150.

Thanks for help with this. I can't afford to refund him. Firstly I have already spent the money on a replacement watch, and secondly the value of the watch I sold him will have decreased somewhat - I presume this is why he has suddenly decided he doesn't want it!

Ebay,"Finding eBay Products to Sell Discussion: Product Sourcing, Shipping Standardization, and More!","I have been selling on eBay off and on for years now. I have stayed a small seller as there seems to be a really big hurdle to jump from small time selling to actually creating a viable business. My main problem is finding products to sell. Right now I go to thrift stores, flea markets, and garage sales, buying anything from vintage video games, baseball hats, to stereo receivers and other random items. I'm not a huge fan of selling used stuff as it's a total crap shoot on what I will even find and cannot really plan a business model as my inventory is at the mercy of what people donate to thrift stores, or what is for sale at flea markets and garage sales.

**Direct Product Sourcing:** I have looked into buying new goods directly from the companies that make them, for example, I once contacted LEGO to see how much I would have to buy in one order to get a wholesale price. LEGO contacted me back and told me I would have to purchase a minimum order of $5000 and have a reputable business that has been around for 2 to 4 years. This was quite discouraging and I moved on. I haven't really contacted other companies since as I assume they are going to have purchasing requirements way above what I can afford.

**Alibaba Overview:** I also looked into buying products from Alibaba or Aliexpress. I found multiple problems with Alibaba:

While Aliexpress is very easy to purchase from, anything that is sold on Aliexpress can already be found on eBay, often for cheaper, sold by who I would guess are Chinese sellers that own a warehouse in the USA. So I can't even compete as being a quick shipper and benefit from being in the USA.

**1).** I would guess around 99% of Alibaba items are a knockoff or direct fake of real products, so there is the issue of copyright infringement. It's sad that eBay does not care about fakes when it's so obvious the big-time Chinese sellers are selling them, but it's a big money maker for them.

**2).** The quality of items I have ordered from Aliexpress in the past have been of poor cosmetic quality. I have ordered items like smartphone styluses to playing card style bottle openers, both items being very scratched or still have molding sprue, and it's not the kind of molding sprue you can just pick off.

**3).** I have watched Youtube videos of other sellers who talk about private labeling Alibaba products and selling them on eBay and Amazon. The problem I see with this is that you can only customize so much with these type of items, like the logo or embroidery on a baseball hat, or the name stamped on a pen. It's not like you are actually making any significant changes to the item, like shape or style, so I don't see how having a bunch of sellers with the same exact item with different names printed on them creates any value.

**Shipping Standardization:** By not having a set product line, shipping these random items becomes a hassle and a bit pricey. For bigger items like stereo equipment, I basically have to buy the shipping materials on demand as it's not worth buying bulk shipping supplies when I rarely get stereo equipment to sell.

**Summary:** This has just been my experience with online selling. I know this sounds discouraging, but I feel these so called “eBay Experts” don't go into nearly enough detail. The depth of many videos I have seen basically glass over online selling as buy low, sell high, which is a gross oversimplification of the selling process and is infuriating at times. It seems that small sellers are doomed to just selling used items and are at the mercy of thrift donations and what's for sale at flea markets and garage sales.

Ebay,"Sold an iPhone, it was returned, I'm a victim of bait and switch","I sold an iPhone for a friend of mine. The buyer claimed it was locked and he needed the Apple ID to unlock it.

Ebay,Your recent eBay transaction may be from a compromised account,"I bought an item on eBay and immediately paid by PayPal. The item was quite a bit cheaper than it should have been (I know, I know...) but the seller had 100% feedback from IIRC about 60 sales.

5 minutes later I get a message from eBay saying ""Your recent eBay transaction may be from a compromised account"" and telling me to open a dispute and choose ""I did not receive the item"" so I did this and found they are giving the seller until next week to respond, if he doesn't they will get involved.

I called PayPal and asked if they could cancel the payment but they said the eBay dispute had to go through first. I asked her if the seller has my money and she says the money is apparently ""frozen"" until this dispute is settled.

So what I wanted to ask is, did this seller try to scam me and if so, what are the chances of me getting my money back?

I did a search on this reddit and found a few similar threads asking this question and most people told them they will get their money back but unfortunately none of the OPs seem to ever come back and say how it worked out for them.

Following from this, if I do get my money back how was this person hoping this scam would work out for them? Were they hoping to the win the dispute? Hoping I wouldn't open a dispute in time for PayPal to ""freeze"" the payment? Was their account ACTUALLY compromised and used to make shady auctions?

Ebay,Buyer purchases an item and sends me back a brand new item that isn't mine,"Prior to purchasing a memory card from me the buy asks if I received it from a samsung promotion, I answer yes.
 
He buys my memory card.
 
4 weeks later, he says the item doesn't work anymore and made a dispute which I am forced to accept because there is no option to fight it. His dispute read ""item noot work"".
 
I receive the item back, it's brand new unused(how does it not work if it hasn't been used?) and then I see on the opposite side of the packaging a label from samsung to him for the same promotion I received the memory card in.
 
 
Since weeks have passed and there have been a large number of these memory cards on ebay, they are selling for significantly less NOW than when I first listed the memory card. This is so ridiculous and I am really worried that ebay/paypal are just going to refund him. 
 
TL:DR buyer purchases an item from me so he has the luxury of not having to wait long to use an item promised to him from samsung that could take weeks to ship with the intent of sending me back the item he receives from samsung.

Ebay,Requested change regarding tracking numbers,"**An Open Letter to UPS, USPS, Amazon and eBay**

I love tracking my packages.  I love watching the process.

* Your package has been shipped
* Departed location Hutchins, Texas
* Arrived at location Champaign, Illinos
* Transferred to USPS for delivery
* Out for delivery
* Your package has been delivered

But right at the beginning of the process, we have something I don't love.

Right at the beginning we have:

* Your package has been shipped

It's nice when that's true, but almost every small seller now prints shipping labels at home.  The process of printing a shipping label at home causes a tracking number to be assigned to that label and triggers an email to me, the receiver of that future package.  

I say future package because the item isn't even in a box yet.  It's going to be hours, days, or sometimes MUCH, MUCH longer before the seller ever hands my package with this shipping label over to UPS or the US Post Office.

Does Amazon say ""We have shipment information?""  No, they say ""Shipped"".

Does eBay say ""We have shipment details?""  No, they say ""Shipped"".

Out of all the largest and most frequently used U.S. package carriers, only FedEx does it right, using the phase ""Shipment information sent to FedEx.""  But even if the sender is using FedEx, Amazon and eBay are going to translate that message into ""Shipped"" on their end.

Just a few months ago I had a package that was marked as SHIPPED for over 20 days while the seller, who got overwhelmed by the volume of orders he received, caught up with packaging and shipping the items he sold.  It was unnerving to believe that I had been scammed for the cost of a PS4 for nearly 3 weeks.

We need to stop covering all cases with the word ""Shipped"".  Just because a tracking number has been electronically reserved does NOT mean that my package has SHIPPED!",10,6,2016-10-05,EBAY,0.03856268897652626,0.9305567741394043,0.030880548059940338

Ebay,Looking for a little advice on a [quite old] CPU I bought through ebay. It arrived with thermal greased and bent pins ... What should I do?,"Kindof TLDR I have attention problems so bear with me; 

* *""Tested working""* CPU arrives with physical damage (bent pins) and thermal grease all over the pins. 

* **it was shipped in an envelope that was CRAFTED by folding a yellow piece of paper up and taping it.**

* It was pretty inexpensive, an excellent potential upgrade to float me until mainboard replacement.

* But I am also on a really tight budget at the moment. There is also the principle of the thing. Who ships sensitive electronics in a selfmade envelope of folded paper???

* I can *probably* bend the pins back into place. 

* I can also use alcohol to remove the thermal grease, following some guidance from the stack exchange sites.

* BUT could **I** be held liable for damaged processor (arrived thus) rather than the careless seller if I attempt to get it into working condition?? 

* I do want to try, but there are other risks... If I fry the board because of some weird thing with a bent pin, EM damage/degradation during shipping, etc., then I am in deep shit.

* I am technically within my rights to request a refund from the seller at this time, since the item is not as described; it was NOT delivered to me in working condition as stated.

* This return would be kind of a waste though, because of all the hassle and spent about 1/3 of the product's value on shipping charges...

* I would assume that if **I** broke off a pin during an attempt to fix the processor (to meet the condition promised in the listing), that it would be *outside of my rights* to request a refund post-fact...

What was supposed to be the original post:

I turn to you all for a spot of advice, since I couldn't find a reasonably easy way to contact any form of customer service (representatives) on the site (you get funneled through a rigidly defined series of forms, and ""advice"" isn't really an option.

I have a really old socket AM2 motherboard, that I will be stuck with for a while. It has my old Athlon X2 5200+ in there right now, but the CPU is a *massive* bottleneck on the system right now. I need just a little more juice.

I ordered a second-hand 6400+ from a seller on the bay for about 30 bucks. It is theoretically the most powerful CPU I can slot in this mainboard (the CROSSHAIR rev. 1.04G BIOS development seems to have been abandoned before AM3 processors were released, and therefore [probably] no backwards-compatibility with it)

*Now, the seller had listed the item as being in tested and working condition.* However, **it was shipped in an envelope that was CRAFTED by folding a yellow piece of paper up and taping it.** The processor was placed in some brown wrapped paper inside, from which it escaped. Basically it was shipped in a piece of paper, and (if it ever was even tested working) was damaged in transit. Also the delivery apparatuses in my area are assholes, and boxes show up clobbered and damaged *all the time.*

Ebay,"Sent buyer a new replacement, eBay still sided with buyer.","*Update - Filed an appeal with eBay and they sided in my favor.  Didn't even have to call them. *

I sold a new in box item and when it arrived the said it didn't work so he opened a return.  I asked to send me a picture of the item so I can still make sure he had it in the same condition it was sent.  He didn't want to do that and said he wouldn't waste this time blah blah blah.  I told him it was a common practice and I was just doing it to protect myself, he finally sent me the pictures about 5-6 days from opening the return. 

While this was happening I had already sourced another replacement to send to him as he previously said he either wanted a return or replacement.  So once he sent me the pictures I sent the replacement and uploaded the tracking to eBay and it arrived a few days later.

I sent him a message a few days after it arrived asking him to close the return, he never replied.  A few days after that I sent another message asking to close the return and if I didn't here back from him by the end of the day I would be forced to contact eBay.  He quickly replied and told me to ""Relax, I'm too busy and don't have time. Contact whoever you want"".

I then reported him to eBay and asked eBay to get involved in the return, explaining what happened.  

I then find out that they side with the buyer.  So I paid for the original and replacement, plus shipping both times and they still side with him and he gets a refund.  

Not sure if this is relevant but when we were talking after he first started the return he started messaging me from another account saying that he wasn't sure if the messages were going through.  Pretty much the rest of the communications were done from his other account.

Ebay,My seller standard is below average,"I've had 420 total sales on eBay. In April I was selling a very popular item. I listed it at night and woke up to 21 sales and a message that eBay had taking down my listing due to a violation which was surprising because to this day hundreds or thousands of sellers are also selling this product. When I check my seller rating it's ""below standard"" because they're saying I was ""out of stock"" for these 21 transactions, so my defect rate is 5%. Why couldn't they just count it as ONE listing, not 21? This may be because I immediately refunded everybody through PayPal so it just counted it as being out of stock. My defect rate needs to be under 2% to be above standard. I'm going to need 600 more perfect sales to get back under 2% defect rate but that would take me 5 years minimum because my seller limits are only 10 items per month.

Ebay,Are sellers allowed list completely different items under the Color/Variant menu,"This really grinds my gears. 

Sellers put a completely different, cheaper, item in as a variant, so their listing can avoid buyers trying to filter out items that are too expensive.

For example:

BUT, one of the ""colours"" is a different item entirely:

http://i.imgur.com/E2lyufB.png

I've seen this before, for example with electronics/cellphones where the device itself may be ...$50 or $60, but it will have a variant that is a $2 usb cable. So I get all these results even if I try to filter items that are less than $40

Ebay,"Buyer changed mind, requested return on auction set for ""no returns"" then left negative feedback, can I get it removed?","Buyer ordered an item. It was delivered ahead of schedule, 4 days after payment. They changed their mind and wanted to return the item. Nothing wrong with the item, they just wanted to return because they didn't need it any more. (They stated this clearly in an eBay message).

The item is sort of a hassle to package up and sell, so I had the auction set to ""NO RETURNS"" as my return policy. Even with this, I feared a negative feedback, so I said I would accept a return but buyer would have to cover return shipping and I would charge a restocking fee.

Buyer apparently was not happy with a restocking fee, instead decides to leave a negative feedback and keep the item and now won't reply. 

In his feedback the buyer stated ""slow to ship"" ""poor customer service"" and ""hard to work with. It was shipped on time and delivered only 4 days after payment, and I was very polite and professional in the many emails.

I ring eBay and email them the proof that this guy was lying and committing fraud, and they refunded me.

I left feedback to the affect that he's a scammer, but eBay removed it and gave ME a warning that negative feedback wasn't allowed. There's nothing I can see on his profile to show anybody that he's a bad person to trade with, so he's essentially gotten away with it.

The Graphics card was working perfectly for me when I had last used it, and I'd say its very unlikely it was damaged in shipping considering the amount of foam and airbags I used in the shipping.

&gt;We asked the buyer to return the item to you for a refund.
When the tracking details show that the item is delivered, we’ll refund the buyer. As a result, we'll either debit your PayPal account or charge your reimbursement payment method.

I called up ebay and explained the return situation and the fact they had asked to cancel the purchase after I shipped it out. Ebay said my only course of action would be to call up ebay again once I receive their return, and appeal for a fraudulent return, if the item is indeed working correctly.

Has anyone had experience with a fraudulent return appeal, or any suggestions for me?

My eBay store pays my rent and bills, and its very frustrating to have to deal with the high amount of no payments after auctions, and then having to deal with fraudulent returns.",10,7,2016-10-12,EBAY,0.1458195596933365,0.8239449858665466,0.0302354134619236
Ebay,Almost Positive I'm Being Scammed - Any Way To Expedite Ebay / Paypal Intervention?,"I purchased an item from an Ebay seller on Friday (seller has been selling on Ebay for almost a year, with 100% positive feedback). When I hadn't received any feedback, or shipping confirmation by Monday night, I began to get a bit suspicious. I looked into the seller's Paypal account, and the account is unverified (why the hell does Ebay allow a seller to accept payments to an unverified Paypal account in the first place?).

I also contacted the seller yesterday, and they haven't responded (nor have I received any shipping confirmation / feedback).

Now today, the seller has suddenly taken down every last item they had for sale (over 50 different items in total). For each item, it now says ""This listing was ended by the seller because the item is no longer available. ""

I'm not sure if the seller was potentially hacked or what, but with all these red flags, something is almost certainly not right.

Is there any way to contact Paypal / Ebay, and explain this all to them, so they can put a hold on the seller's account / prevent them from withdrawing the money until this is settled? It just seems idiotic to sit on my thumbs and wait for some arbitrary date to pass (at which point, the seller is most likely long gone with my money).

Ebay,eBay Sourcing Discussion with Example Product,"I have been looking to move away from selling used items on eBay as it is not very profitable and requires a lot of hunting around for products. I often come up empty handed when hunting for items to resell at thrift shops, garage sales, and so on. I would like to move to sourcing products from Alibaba so I can standardize my shipping materials and have a consistent supply of items to sell. Every item I have looked at selling from Alibaba already has someone selling the exact same thing on eBay for less than Alibaba, or for a bit more than Alibaba, but the margins would be so tight there may be less than a dollar of profit to be made. I'm wondering if i'm just paying too much attention to price and should ignore what others are selling it for and try to brand myself aggressively, or maybe if I use different keywords in my listing title I would have a chance of being found over the big eBay sellers.

I have posted an example of a product that could be sourced cheaper than what a USA based eBay seller sells them for, but I figure I would need to sell this same item for around $11.99 with free shipping to make it worth the time and make a reasonable profit. I'm not sure if i'm just suffering from analysis paralysis, or if my original judgement was right and a low price is basically the only thing that matters when competing with other eBay sellers. This price conundrum of mine is what has deterred me from buying products from overseas.

Another thing I worry about is copyright infringement, I know the obvious that I should not buy anything on Alibaba that has a brand name on it, but it's really hard to tell if the design is stolen or not. This case could be a ripoff of some trademarked brand i've never heard of for all I know, it's just something I worry about. Items like baseball caps are probably safe as they all pretty much have the same physical design.

Ebay,"Are there rules on ebay for personal messages? Specifically, am allowed to suggest someone buy my product?","I've recently put up an item on ebay.  It was a kershaw knife.  Not only did I post the one, but I posted two different kershaw knifes (lets call them knife A &amp; B).  *They are in alright condition and fairly cool knifes.*

Anyways, for some time I've had the same guy as the highest bid on both **A** &amp; **B** knives listings.  This is good for me because I can pay less for shipping.  So to reduce my shipping costs and max my profit, I am really trying to sell the two knives to the same person, and the listings will end at minutes of eachother.

However, someone else placed a higher bid on Knife **A** So... I was wondering, can I message that person and notify them that I infact have knife **B** for sale aswell? *Ideally doing this, they will place a bid on the second one and either drive up the price; or win both knives (the more preferable option)

Ebay,Purchased a damaged mower and came more broken than expected,"I bought a lawn mower that was listed as “For parts or not working.” The only line in the description that mentioned that it was damaged is 



“This item's box is damaged and the item has bent wheel adjusters and mower bag attachments. It is sold as-is, but is otherwise in good, working condition!”



I would have been fine if the only problems with it was that the wheel adjusters and bag attachments were bent. I received the box today and the first thing I noticed that oil was everywhere. That’s not really a problem just a mess. Then I noticed that the front left wheel was cracked and the shielding around it was damaged. Two of the wheel adjusters that were supposed to be bent are actually broken. All these problems up until now would have actually been fine with me but the biggest problem I have is that the front wheel bracket is bent inwards as if someone was jumping on top of the mower. One of the wheels won’t even turn which is kinda a problem for an all-wheel drive lawn mower.



I don’t know what to do now. Should I just try to fix it? I haven’t even put gas in it to test it yet.



Do I have a case of eBay buyer protection here?



TLDR:
Bought a mower listed as “for parts” with a description saying the only thing wrong was bent wheel adjusters and bag attachments.

Ebay,"Two part question about an unusual listing that has both ""local pick up"" and ""one day shipping""","I noticed an unusual listing which is a used penny is for sale auction style. I have two questions for the eBay elite...

1. In the title and the listing, the seller states ""Local pick up only"", however, under the shipping details it states ""free one day shipping"". If you were the high bidder, could you force the seller to mail the item or does local pick up trump any shipping promises?

2. This seller is continually auctions off one used penny with the auction starting off at $o.o1. Other than just being silly or stupid, is there any reason or benefit that seller might do this?

Ebay,Selling Alibaba Products on eBay - Copyright Concerns USA,"I'm an eBay seller looking to move away from selling used goods as it is way too difficult to find decent used products to sell. My local thrift shops, and shops in other nearby towns rarely get anything good, and if they do it's already been looked up and priced accordingly. I want to buy items off of Alibaba, but I have concerns regarding copyright infringement.

I know that I should not buy anything with a brand name from Alibaba as they are all fakes, but what about copyright infringement as far as design? If I buy phone cases that are sold to me as generic with no logos, can still get in trouble if they are the same or similar design to real branded cases, like Otter Box for example? I have looked at Alibaba cases that I don't recognize as a branded case design, but there are so many branded cases out there I can't keep up with all of them. I'm just wondering what the rules are as far as selling unbranded items that could be a direct copy or similar design to a real branded product. I was also thinking I would eventually start private labeling products, so i'm worried I could be branding real products with my own name which would cause other issues.",4,1,2016-10-16,EBAY,0.07776664942502975,0.8953925967216492,0.02684081718325615
Ebay,Buyer claimed the board was damaged but he's using it...,"Hello guys,

I sold 3 weeks ago a brand new skateboard for $2400. 

I sent it through UPS with the official box (the company is advising everyone to carry/ship the board in this particular box) and everything was fine. 

The buyer received the board and claimed it was damaged. He sent me a picture of the scratch, and indeed there was one. We checked with UPS and they basically said that they couldn't do anything.

I told him that if he wants to return it it's ok, as long as he didn't use the board and kept it just like he received it. 

He told me that he used it because ""I can't know if the board is working or not if I don't use it"". The problem is that his claim was about the shipping, not the functioning part of the board. So he shouldn't have used it. Now I can't know for sure if the scratch was there before he used it or not. 

Then, I told him I can't accept a return : he used the board so I won't be able to sell it as a brand new one now. He threatened me, saying that he works at the department of state. He also told me he will call American Express and block the payment. He also asked me private information such as the reason I'm in the US and which type of visa I have. 

I called the high value claims service. The guy I had on the phone was probably the less competent person I had to deal with in my life. He was saying over and over ""At this time, we can't do anything, you have to send him the returning label"". Every time I was making a point he was saying the same thing, probably reading a script he had on his desk. I was so pissed I hung up on him.

What are my options ? I mean this guy is using the board, waiting for me send the returning label. It's as if I bought a pair of brand new shoes, I request a return and then I wear them for 2 weeks before sending them back... How the hell can he win this case ? 

When I'll get the board back, can I open a dispute because I received the board a lot more damaged than in his photo he sent when he got it ?

Ebay,USPS - your item has been tendered to a military agent,"I'm the seller.

It was delivered to a military base. It was the buyers confirmed address. I printed the label directly from Paypal.

Ebay,Suspect fraudulent return. What can I expect? What can I do to protect myself?,"I sold a handheld GPS 30 days ago. It worked perfectly, basically new from the shop. Never even took it outside. I shipped with tracking and insurance. Once tracking showed it delivered, I messaged to confirm that everything was satisfactory. No reply. I've sent weekly messages since. No replies. No feedback left for me. Uh oh.

Today, a month later, I finally hear from the buyer. They've initiated a return request, saying the item is defective. And they left me negative feedback too! Poor form, buddy.

They are claiming the buttons are screwed up. I've responded saying it could be they need to review the manual as to how to use the buttons, as the functions change depending on the screen view and this can be tricky to learn. But if after doing this they still feel it is broken I encouraged them to contact USPS for reimbursement via the shipping insurance.

**Here's the kicker:** They tell me they had bought the unit for a friend from Germany who wanted a GPS to use in Peru. They say the device wasn't tested for nearly a month because it took that long for the German friend to visit the USA, travel with the GPS to Peru, and attempt to use it on the mountains there. If the unit is indeed broken, there is no way to know if the damage occurred during my shipment or with their friend carrying it around in the wild.

Their friend won't return to the USA for another 10 days or more. So they can't even check to ensure it's really broken before the 6 days I have to respond. How convenient. This smells fishy. Leaving me bad feedback before any opportunity for resolution makes me suspicious as well.

I suspect they intended to return the item all along, essentially renting a GPS device for free. I suspect they are only claiming it's defective to get around the fact that the 14-day return period is long over. For those who have had experiences with such stories, what can I expect from this? Are there any steps I should be taking to help protect myself? Any particular ways of handling things? In particular, how might I deal with the whole ""respond in 6 days or we'll open a case against you"" thing, since they can't even confirm the unit is broken in that time?

I think my position is strong, because they didn't check the item for a month despite all my messages, they may have used the item a fair amount, and even if it's truly broken there was shipping insurance. But I'm paranoid that eBay will take the easy way out and just screw me over. :(",16,5,2016-10-17,EBAY,0.07154601812362671,0.8945374488830566,0.03391658142209053

Ebay,Buyer says item's condition was not accurate.,"So I've been selling my collection of Batman statues on eBay, and have sold six of them with no problem.

I thought it was in excellent shape, but apparently didn't go over it with a magnifying glass like he has. I suspect he wanted to re-sell it as new, but who knows.

I said ""no returns"" in my listing and ""excellent condition"" is a subjective description. He never asked any questions about the statue's condition while it was listed or asked for more detailed pictures, so I feel the fault is his.

It is a really long story but seller sold item that didn't function, opened ebay return and then seller said he would fix, closed ebay return (which TIL can only ever be opened once.), then seller says can't fix.

Ebay,The new EBay Concierge Program is actually pretty nice,"I know we've had a lot of horror stories about how bad eBay's customer service is but I've had some pretty positive interactions with them via the new Concierge program.

It mostly centers around a watch I sold that the customer claimed wasn't as described although the ""defect"" they claimed was stated twice in the listing. Under their new pilot for returns, I knew I was protected on the shipping costs on this, but it wasn't showing an option to adjust the amount when accepting the return so I called their support and was directed to the concierge assistant.

I ended up with a dedicated representative that noted the shipping adjustment would normally be made upon receipt of the item. Additionally, I was wanting to upload a label since this was a high value item and I wanted it insured. The concierge actually called me back an hour later to make sure that I'd gotten the label uploaded correctly, which it hadn't for some reason. Despite saying it accepted pdfs, it did not.

Ultimately, the customer never shipped the item back in time, and instead of *me* having to chase eBay down, the rep closed the case without me calling and and then called to let me know that they'd closed it out for us.

Ebay,Been selling for a few months now. Finally getting my first screwjob from PayPal and an incompetent buyer.,"I mailed the package to the address provided at time of purchase. Tracking info showed it was delivered. Then an unauthorized transaction dispute was started on PayPal. I gave PayPal the tracking number to prove it was delivered.

Not sure how he could know what happened to it, but I got it back a few days later. I messaged him back asking if I could send it again to a more secure address. He gave me an alternate address. Then I asked for an email address so I could send a PayPal funds request to cover postage so I could ship it again to a more secure address. Now PayPal has closed the case, refunded the purchase price, and also charged a $20 chargeback fee.

My response was to check with the Post Office first, as I've had issues in the past where the postal worker simply got too busy, checked the item delivered but brought it back to the PO undelivered.

Ebay,Seller shipped me a cancelled item,"I bought an item last week and bought one day shipping on it and after buying I noticed that the shipping estimate was for this week and I contacted the seller and told him I might as well have bought ground since the estimates were THE SAME. So the seller told me to just cancel the item and buy with ground shipping so I cancelled that item and he refunded me my money shortly after. I bought the item again on the next day and waited for it but then I noticed he shipped 2 items. One was the cancelled refunded item and one was the item he told me to buy again. I told the seller he made a mistake and got no response so I just waited for them to get here(they got here on the same day). They came and then I contacted ebay who told me to contact them again and I was able to talk to the seller, they told me to just take that one to UPS and return it and I wouldn't have to pay to ship it back(I did not open the box). So I did and UPS told me they would not return it and I should have refused it but I did not even get the chance to do that as the guy left both packages on the porch. Its pretty frustrating as the seller told me to cancel the item and he was the one who lied about his shipping method(both boxes say FedEx Ground).

So I either have to pay to ship it back or keep it(I don't want it as I have two now) and I don't want to pay to ship it back as its a big item and it will cost me about half the price of the item.

Ebay,"Sellers Beware: If you use the Global Shipping Option for international shipping, your item may be very limited to who can bid on it!","I'm in the US, and a buyer contacted me about an item I was selling, and asked why I don't ship to Canada. Shipping to Canada is maybe an extra $2. I checked the listing, and Canada was not exempt on my eligible countries for shipping. After contacting ebay, they explained that due to import/export laws, some categories are exempt to certain countries through the global shipping option, even though these items can legally be shipped to these countries. If you have checked the Global Shipping option, and then no additional shipping options, they cannot bid on your item. I think this is a huge oversight on ebays part. When you list an item for sale with the global shipping option, there should be a little box that says: Hey now! Some countries are exempt from the global shipping option, so if you are willing to ship to the following countries, you will have to add additional intentional shipping options. They said they would pass the information on to their management department, but if anyone else has ever done this, you know it won't do any good.

Ebay,Update: I got my $20 chargeback fee waived. Read my exchange with PayPal here.,"Yesterday I posted my frustration with PayPal trying to charge me $20 for a chargeback on a non-returnable item that was delivered and then sent back “return to sender.” Buyer claimed that someone stole it from his porch and mailed it back just to be mean, but that’s fishy because he would have to know that it had been returned.

After two email exchanges, I got the $20 chargeback fee waived. I didn't appreciate how the rep worded it: ""As a one-time courtesy I have waived the chargeback fee for this transaction."" As if it were still somehow my fault. No admission of fault on their end for not following their seller protection policy to the letter, which can be found here: https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/brc/seller-protection-paypal-seller-benefit I practically had to write like a lawyer seeking damages to get them to cooperate.

Here’s my exchange with PayPal:

From me:

I received an email today from PayPal stating that a chargeback fee of $20 has been charged because PayPal claims ""we did not receive the necessary documentation we requested from you."" I provided plenty of documentation during the dispute process, including tracking information proving the package was delivered to the buyer's address. In fact, other than a tracking number, no specific documentation was ever requested by PayPal, contrary to the claims made in today's email from PayPal. What happened to the documents I uploaded? Did no one bother to look at them?

The buyer messaged me through eBay claiming that someone had taken the package from his address and marked it ""return to sender"" without his authorization, and asked me to send it to an alternate address once I received it. I asked the buyer for his email address so that I could send a PayPal request for funds to cover the cost of postage to send the package again, and have been awaiting a response.

I am fine with refunding the purchase price to the buyer, because I have the merchandise back, but it is unfair to assess me a $20 fee for the refund just because someone else took the buyer's package and sent it back, which is entirely beyond my control. I upheld my responsibility to the buyer by sending the merchandise to the address provided at time of purchase and providing tracking information for the package. I demand that the $20 chargeback fee be returned to my account immediately.





From PayPal:

A $20.00 USD fee is assessed to cover our cost of processing the chargeback. This is a fee we incur from the credit card company that is passed along to you at a reduced rate.
Please note that the fee is waived:

• If all requirements of PayPal Seller Protection Policy have been met.
• If you are participating in our PayPal Preferred program and the chargeback was for an on-eBay transaction.




From me:

I met the requirements for seller protection. Here's what was in the transaction details:

Seller protection: Eligible

Eligible when you...

Ship to the address on this page.

Save your tracking or shipping info.

Follow the requirements for seller protection.


The item was a tangible good.

I shipped the item to the address in the transaction details.

I saved the tracking info. Same was provided to PayPal during the dispute process, along with documentation of successful delivery to the address in the transaction details by the U.S. Postal Service.

The item was not returnable per my policy on the eBay listing, therefore not eligible for a legitimate return for a refund. There was never a claim that the item was not as described. It was taken from the delivery location and ""returned to sender"" by a third party without the buyer's authorization, according to the buyer, which is beyond my control, which, if true, is an illegal act. As stated previously, I do not mind refunding the payment, as the merchandise was returned to my possession, but charging me $20.00 because someone else did something illegal is unfair and immoral. Please explain in more detail how PayPal thinks I did not meet the requirements of the Seller Protection Policy. If PayPal cannot prove a failure to meet the requirements, I demand that the $20.00 fee be waived. 



From PayPal:

As a one-time courtesy I have waived the chargeback fee for this transaction.

Ebay,Just received an item back that I sold in January...,"I sold an item back in January and later received an email in March asking to return it due to a claimed error on the size of the item.

I can no longer refund the transaction through PayPal and recover the PayPal/eBay fees, so I offered to send them a direct PayPal payment for the original purchase price minus those fees.

Ebay,Ebay seems to have ZERO seller protection,"I sold an iphone in almost perfect exterior condition but a recurring blue screen issue. The screen would flash blue then restart. very frustrating but the phone still turned on and functioned like normal. I sold and shipped the phone. The buyer came back and said He had the phone plugged in over night and it would not start up. I listed this phone under defective for parts and also no returns (I now know these dont mean anything). He claims it wouldnt start and asked for a refund. I accepted and paid his shipping fees to send it back.



On Monday I received the phone back basically destroyed. the two screws on the bottom that hold it together were missing and the phone was not fully shut but the screen was lifted. Inside multiple interior screws and brackets were missing like he harvested what he wanted and slapped it back together. the screen bracket was bent and seperated the LCD from the digitizer. the battery had a large hole/tear in it. I attempted fixing this phone before i sold it and know what the interior looked like before. Finally the sim card tray was black instead of silver and not the one i sent out with it. 



I should add on sunday i received an email saying this buyer has had their account removed and to take caution when dealing with this buyer. (shocking). I contacted ebay explained the situation and the lady said you need to message the buyer and explain what happened and offer them a partial refund. Then document the phone and ebay will examine the photos and start an investigation. I said what about $0 refund she said yes that will work. keep your messages in ebay and wait 2 days. 2 days pass with no word from this suspended buyer. i call ebay again and say i want to close this. She said thats not how it works. Since you messaged them they have the opportunity to dispute your claim. If they admit to tampering with item only then will ebay refund you. If they say its not true the funds will automatically go back to buyer. 



At this point im furious. She also said photos dont matter and wont be used in the case because you can doctor them. Also I said cant you see why their account was removed and believe what im telling you she said no. Every case is on an individual basis with no external research being done. I am again shocked at their policy. it is 100% designed to protect the buyer never the seller. I could buy $500 sunglasses swap them with fakes claim i was sent fakes then send it back to buyer and get the money and shades. 



Is there something im missing? this might be the worst run business policy ive ever heard of. Why doesnt everyone scam ebay sellers? Its stupid easy and guaranteed to work.

Ebay,"Won a dispute, seller is now stalking and harassing me and my family. What can I do?","Wondering if anyone might have any wisdom here that eBay was unable to help with. 

Basically, I purchased an item that ended up being a knockoff - started a return, return was accepted. The seller said they would not pay for the label until I did, then asked me to send it to someone else, etc.. (seller is out of country).
eBay told me they had to pay for it, put it on hold for 5 days - they didn't pay for a label or give a refund, so eBay issued the refund and told me not to respond to the seller anymore. (This was two days ago, still haven't gotten my refund but whatever). 

This morning, I got an eBay message from the seller saying I need to pay to send the item back, etc. and that they will call ______ phone number to talk to me. 

The phone number they listed is not at all tied to my account, it's the number for my father's business (who works a guest house on our property). So they google'd my shipping address and then some to look for personal information. 

I replied via eBay warning them about what they did and told them not to try to contact me at all anyway other than eBay, and then I reported it to eBay. eBay said they'd issue a warning, etc... 

Fast forward to now, my Dad calls me saying he got an email from the seller, claiming I was trying to fraud or something and saying he will inform the FBI, etc unless we pay them back. 

So, he looked up my address - found my family's business, then another email, and emailed my father. 

Called eBay again and told them all this, they just said ""we'll escalate it and take appropriate action"", but they can't tell me what they're doing about it I guess. 

Is there anything else I can do? I've thought about calling the police, but it's not a domestic issue so I'm not even sure what the right mediums are. 

If anyone has had experience with something like this or has any advice, please let me know. This is completely creepy and inappropriate behavior.

Ebay,"Buyer doesn't pick up package for 14 days, claims it's lost and that the post office doesn't know anything about it.","So here's the case: 

I shipped a $400 item from Norway to the US, with the only shipping option I have. It's a priority option that gets handed over to USPS Priority Mail, and says ""PO to addressee"", which means that it'll go to the post office. It requires a signature to be delivered.

3 weeks after it's shipped, I notice the tracking still says ""Arrived at post office"" (it's been there 1 week at this point), so I contact the buyer to give a heads up, and get a ""thank you, I'll check into it"". 5 days later, I get a message from the buyer asking if I know where the shipment is, and I give him/her the info one more time. 

Now, one week later, I get a message from the buyer claiming that he/she hasn't received the item, and that the post office doesn't know anything. The tracking info (USPS) still shows ""arrived at post office"". 

What bothers me is that for the past month or so, 30% of my shipments say ""arrived at post office"", even though they've been handed to the buyer, i.e USPS never updated their info, and for the rest 70% the tracking clearly states that it has been delivered. 

Here are some likely scenarios I can think of: 

A) The buyer was way too late with picking up the shipment. I know they hold shipments for 15 days, so that would mean it was returned yesterday or the day before. Not to sound rude against the buyer, but he/she sounds either extremely slow or inexperienced, by the messages I've gotten. 

B) The buyer has gotten the item, but noticed that the tracking hasn't been updated, and figures he/she can open up a INR case and keep money plus item. 

C) Honest case of the post office losing the item.

I cheked with ebay support and they say ""It may be possible that there is some requirements in order to purchase that item. Please contact the seller and get all the details.""

So i check his seller's page and this phone looks like his first item he sold, so me as a seller i know that it takes like 3 weeks for the Payement of your first sold product to get into the paypal account.

So do i just wait or is this something else? I sent him a message and I am waiting for it.

Ebay,"Bought car part on ebay, seller changed shipping causing delays","Hi all,

I purchased a part for my project car on eBay and the seller had two options for shipping. One via USPS that was a little more and one via FedEx. The USPS one said deliverery would be between Oct. 19 to Oct. 22. I can't remember the exact dates the FedEx one said it would arrive but it was later. I chose the USPS one because I wanted it here by this weekend so I could install it this weekend.

The seller shipped it via FedEx even though I requested USPS. The item is not going to arrive until Wednesday messing up my plans for the weekend. If he had shipped it the way I requested I would have the item now. 

I messaged him asking why he changed it and he stated because he's had a lot of issues with USPS damaging his stuff so FedEx is safer. He also says he paid double in shipping even though the FedEx option was cheaper. I personally have never had any issues with USPS but I've had a lot of issues with FedEx delivering to the wrong house. I feel that he should have contacted me to see if the change was good with me. If USPS had damaged the items it wouldn't be his fault, it would be the shipping company therefore he wouldn't be held liable for it, correct?

What can I do here? Anything? Or is the seller able to just ship a different way then I paid? I would like to get my shipping cost back as it didn't arrive when it was supposed to because of the seller (not because of the post office), but I'm not sure if that's something I am able to do or not as ebay resolution center doesn't have a ""wrong shipping method"" option.

Ebay,Buyer says item was removed from the package. What do I do?,"I woke up to a nice wall of text from an angry buyer claiming the item they bought from me was delivered, but the package was empty.

1. I have no proof of anything other than the tracking saying it was delivered. And it was.

2. I was given no warning that they lived in a high crime area or that there was risk of it being left on a porch, had the user contacted me and informed me of these risks, I could have purchased insurance and used a different box.

3.  I find it odd that the user claims they came home to an empty box at there door. Why would a thief take extra time to remove the item, rather than just take the box and go?

Ebay,"Ebay account hijacked, unauthorized purchases made","Hi all,

Somewhat new here, I guess this is a combined rant along with a couple of questions.

Yesterday afternoon I received 4 mobile alerts regarding PayPal payments for items I never purchased. Naturally I started freaking out, the 4 purchases made were in excess of 1000.00.

I logged into my PayPal account and immediately starting changing my password, pin, security questions the whole deal. 
I immediately went to resolution center and submitted cases regarding unauthorized activity and got that rolling.

Logged into my ebay account and sure enough, there were the purchases, all made within several minutes of each other.  After changing all of my security information I got on the phone with ebay (which, thankfully, was a godsend) and they eases my concerns moving forward. 

Going back to my PayPal account - I only have a checking account setup with no credit card backup, and I probably had less than 700.00 total in that account - does anyone know how someone would be able to purchase well over 1000.00 worth of goods when I didn't have the money to even cover those expenses? 

I checked my ebay account and it looks like someone was able to go in and change my primary shipping address - in doing some googling on the address, and sure enough - it's a company called Meest America - from their website:

Meest-America has become a dominant force in package delivery with services to Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia.

They never even bothered to change anything else on my account, just the primary shipping address.

Has anyone else had this happen to them as well? Thanks for listening!",5,7,2016-10-26,EBAY,0.02512865699827671,0.9130798578262329,0.06179148331284523
Ebay,Any recommendations on what one could sell more regularly?,"Hey all, new poster here so sorry if I'm out of bounds here at all. 

I'm a fairly part-time ebayer, have lots of old video game related things I've sold over thru the pay few years to help when times are tough. 

Well times are very tough for me right now and I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions on something I may be able to look into selling regularly online that I may not be thinking of. 

I frequent the thrift stores and goodwills around my area and get luckily occasionally but I'm really only looking at video games when it comes to that. 

Is there something with clothing that I could (somewhat easily) get into with reselling? 

Sorry if this is a bit vague and sound like a ""how do I get rich quick"" thing. Just looking for any suggestions. 


Also does anyone have advice on selling old yugioh and Pokémon cards? I have an old bin full of them and I'm not sure where to start.

Ebay,"Charging Sales Tax on Ebay (I know, I know...but there is so much contradictory info!)","Greetings, I have scoured Ebay forums and have searched/read many posts about taxes via this subreddit, but I am still so confused!

Ebay,"Buyer returned an item claiming it was ""defective"", yet upon return item is fine. Lied to force a return! Anyone have experience with this?","I received a return request from a buyer, claiming the item didn't work - ""defective or not as described"". Upon receiving the item back, it works perfectly. I suspect they lied about it being defective in order to force me to accept it back.

Has anyone had this experience? I doubt I could force them to buy it back (though technically they agreed to a legal contract to buy the described item for the agreed price). But at the very least I hope eBay will refund me the return shipping cost (charging the buyer instead) and hit the buyer with a bad mark on their account.

Ebay,Need advice on what to do regarding this purchase.,"I pre-ordered this item near the start of September just a few days before it's Japanese release. The listing mentioned that they would be importing the item from Japan and they I should receive it by mid-late October. I thought this was perfect as I was buying this for someone whose birthday is near the end of October.

Overall I spent $80 on this particular item, $20 of which went into shipping. I was satisfied with this price as it was a few bucks cheaper than anywhere else on eBay (I saved $2) and I didn't know any Japanese websites from which I could buy.

As October rolls in I start to get nervous seeing as the item still hasn't shipped, but it wasn't until a few days ago that I finally contacted the seller as I'm noticing that everyone else already has it on stock.

They inform me that even though they're in California they import their items from their Japanese distributor (which I already knew) what I didn't know was that they only import once a month and that apparently something went wrong with their September import because they didn't receive my item with the shipment. If all goes according to plan they will be receiving the item in November and I should receive it by mid November.

Normally I am laid back about these sorts of things. But I bought this as a birthday present for a very special someone. I also paid $20 of shipping (which the seller isn't refunding) 

Would it be unreasonable to ask for a refund under these circumstances? How long does it take for eBay to process these things? This seller also doesn't allow refunds, is there anything I can do if they refuse my ""return""?",10,2,2016-10-26,EBAY,0.0624629482626915,0.9022618532180786,0.03527520224452019

Ebay,Sold a bottle of authentic cologne buyer claimed fake,"Quick version:

-Sold a bottle of cologne
-User contacted me stating it was fake
-Asked buyer to bring to macy's for them to verify
-Macys verified it was genuine
-Now buyer claims the smell is weak 
-Macys rep told them it was real but probably not stored properly
-Buyer opened case for ""Doesn't seem authentic""
-eBay has asked them to provide 3rd party documentation

I am a well established seller on ebay, I called them last night and the rep told me I was most likely in the clear.  I also have several feedback selling the same item to other ebayers with all positive feedback.  I will say I am not that interested with selling fragrances on ebay in the future.  After this happened, I have researched a bit further and it seems like selling name brand authentic fragrances on ebay can be a challenge due to so many fakes out there.

Ebay,ebay is cancelling my account for no reason - please help,"Hi I've had an ebay account for many years. I'll post a quick rundown of what's happened here:

* Successfully logged in to my account this morning to sell some items. It's probably been 1-2 years since I don't use ebay very often but I have a great feedback rating.
* Noticed I get errors when I click on certain pages like ""sell"" or ""account settings"" so I called customer service.
* CSR informed me that my account was in the process of being deleted. When asked why he said maybe because of non-use. I asked if that is written in the small print somewhere like how often I need to log in, he said no. I asked why they didn't send an email notifying me he said they would do that 30 days out (yet it's still blocked now....no answer).
* CSR says he will work on getting it reinstated and will call me back.
* CSR calls back in about an hour and says he and the tech guy (forgot what he called them) worked on it for an hour and couldn't get it reinstated. Says it's blocked and will be deleted and my best bet is to create a new account. I told him I don't want to do that since I have good feedback. 
* I asked who else I can talk to - no one else has more power than them to reverse it.
* I asked if he can send me an email of the current status (basically everything he told me) and he said a bunch of times he would ""try"" but sometimes if the account is not active they can't send an email to the linked account. I gave him another email address and begged him to send this email and he said he would try his best.
* He said he would also keep trying to get it reinstated.

Is there anything else I can do? Any secret phone numbers with more powerful people? I can't imagine that the company doesn't have the power to reinstate an account especially since I wasn't notified it would be deleted UGH!

edit: It's been a few hours and no email from them. Also not sure why this post is downvoted, any advice is helpful.

edit2: Apparently my account is beyond repair. Granted I only sell stuff every few years or so but having that positive feedback even if it's just 20 still might help someone buy it rather than pass. I know I'm not a huge seller like a lot of people on here but this is frustrating as hell. They said they sent me a 30 day termination notice last year which is not in my email but I can either assume it wasn't sent or my email filtered it as spam. Either way nothing I can do and I have to make a new account but I really don't want to deal with ebay at all anymore. I asked how often I would need to log in to not be flagged as dormant and she said once a week! LOL no thanks.",10,5,2016-10-27,EBAY,0.09108190983533859,0.8832008242607117,0.025717271491885185

Ebay,How to completely unlink paypal from my ebay account?,"Hey all! I'm sorry if this is a stupid question but here we go. I once linked my Paypal and eBay accounts.

Ebay,address blunder VS tracking,"I apologize in advance if this is a naive post---
 
I ordered something about 3 weeks ago. Recently moved house. Changed my paypal to my new address, but did not realise ebay had its own seperate address that I needed to update... the package was sent (standard royal airmail to Australia) without a tracking number (which I didn't realise and wasn't stated anywhere on the listing). 

A tracking number would have been really helpful because my mail redirection service would use that to change the previous address to the new one - but now they can't. It's been about 4 days since I should have received the package. 

Do I have any rights here? I know I made a mistake in not updating the address but c'mon who sends a $100 package overseas without tracking??? Is that normal?

I contacted the post office of my prev address and they are looking out for it. I have just posted a letter with my contact details to the new residents of my previous address today (I didn't go in person because I am too awkward - should I drop by anyway, is that appropriate/helpful?). I don't think I can contact the rental agency as they were not very helpful while we lived there.

I have already contacted the seller and let them know the situation.

Also worth noting, the post office person said there was a strike this week in customs or some other post related service - can't recall what it was for sure. So maybe it is being held up there but I am just trying to be organized.

Ebay,There's a selling restriction on my account due to someone I don't know linking to my PayPal 3 years ago. eBay isn't helping me. Any advice?,"So here's my story.  I've had my eBay account for well over a decade, but use it sparingly.  Last item I sold was in 2010, and I don't believe I've bought anything since then.  I have a few items I want to sell, so I started writing up a new listing last week, and when I went to post it, I received an error message saying ""It looks like you've reached the number of items and amount you can list.

I've stewed on it for a week, and tried calling back again today.

Ebay,Seller Never Responded to (now closed) Return Case. I got my refund. Do I still have to return the item?,"Hi. A little bit of backstory: I bought a Razer Deathadder 2013 for what the seller claimed was ""new out of box"" but tested to see if it works once. I bought the item and when it arrived I was not happy to find an obviously used mouse. There were food crumbs in the mouse's crevices, and the logo (which is located where your palm rests) was worn down. Not only this, but the mouse had the infamous double click problem (this can happen to used mice over time). I then contacted the seller about it. We went back and forth for 30 minutes. He claimed that the mouse was brand new and the problems must have came from shipping. I sent him multiple pictures of the mouse showing it's wear, but he kept claiming the problem came from miss-handling. I opened a case for ""Item not as described"" where they told me that the seller should send me info to return the item and that if he didn't respond in 5 days, they would step in. Quote: ""Return shipping charges are handled as specified in the sellers return policy. Sellers are required to pay for return shipping if an item is returned because it doesn't match the listing description. Since you claimed that the item was not as described, you will need to return the item to the seller at their expense. I have already contacted the seller to work it out with you by sending a prepaid shipping label or send money through PayPal to cover the return shipping cost.  The case is on hold for 5 days to wait for their response.

Quote: ""*Once you received a prepaid label or a refund from the seller to cover the cost of return shipment, please ship the item back to your seller for a full refund and provide us the return tracking number. Please let us know if you received it or not. We will get back after 5 days to take action on the case.*"".

Well the seller didn't respond at all for five days and I received a full refund yesterday. **My Question Is:** Do I still have to return the item? Today the seller messaged me the information to send it back, but for multiple reasons I don't want to. 1) Now that the case is closed, I don't have eBay watching the transaction. 2) This seller always responded quickly, even after my message telling him the condition of the mouse, he responded in a minute. The fact that he didn't contact me in those five days seemed pretty deliberate. 3) The seller is in Israel. Shipping price will be pretty high, and if he doesn't pay me for it, I won't be happy. If I don't have to return it, what should I reply to the seller? It's strange because I've been on eBay since 2014 and have never had to open a case before.

She opens the return case as ""Wrong Size"", sees that I charge a restocking fee, and immediately messages me to state that she doesn't agree with the restocking fee and ""will leave appropriate feedback"" if I charge her restocking.  I sent a message back clarifying if she was stating she would leave negative feedback for following the guidelines she agreed to when purchasing the item.  No response.

We received both cases back yesterday, which of course fit fine on the correct phone model.  I refunded her minus the restocking fee, and sure enough, this morning she messages me back and tells me she left a negative because of my poor customer service.  Huh.  I went and checked the feedback and damn near cackled with glee:

Seller refused return, had to get eBay involved, charged 30% restocking fee.

Oh sweet!  Let's see - I never refused the return, the case was never escalated to eBay, and eBay doesn't allow me to charge more than 20% restocking.

Called eBay, the first rep immediately agreed that the feedback was eligible for removal, and also stated she would submit a feedback extortion complaint on top of removing the feedback.  I was concerned since they've been so weird the past few months about removing negs, but I feel like I got a big ole win.  It's taking a lot of my self-control to be an adult and not send a NYAH NYAH message back to the buyer.

I did a bit of searching through the subreddit and I saw the situation from the seller's side, but not the buyer's side, so I wanted to confirm with people more experienced than myself.

I purchased two items off of eBay, paid via paypal. Seller ships the item via Lasership and it gets marked as delivered to my zip code, but I don't have my package. I contacted the seller, he told me to contact my neighbors or Lasership. Lasership basically told me to pound sand, in multiple ways, and my neighbors haven't seen a package.

Ebay,How to refund on ebay? Phone sold as new but according to IMEI it is more that one year old.,"I have bought a telephone from ebay seller because the offer said it is new. The telephone is unusable now because of a motherboard failure (according to official manufacturer service partner.) Seller says that the warranty period (3months) is over but as they sold the phone as new, I thought that the phone will be eligible for manufacturer guarantee for 1 year from purchase date.

Unfortunately the phone had been sold earlier in the USA according to its IMEI and serial number so manufacturer warranty had been already over at the time I purchased the phone. This means that it wasn't new so I would like to have my money back.

I can't reach the listing of the item to prove that it says its new. Ebay resolution center don't help because the purchase is more that 3 months old. Paypal resolution center don't help either, after I have written down the above it noticed me in a message box that this is not that kind of problem that resolution center is for.

Ebay,Seeking advice on seller who uses a shill bidding account.,"I've won an auction for a lot of used video games.  The auction ended in the middle of the night so I bid the highest I would be willing to pay for the auction and went to bed.  The next day I saw that I won the auction at exactly my highest bid.  I thought this was a strange coincidence so I thought I would check out how the bidding went in the bid history.  A bidder with zero feedback walked my bid up a dollar at a time until it surpassed my highest bid, then cancelled that higher bid.  I thought this was suspicious so I looked at that bidder's history and saw that they have bid on 10 auctions total, all for this seller, and have won none of them.  Checking the seller's other auctions, this account bids up all of them and never wins.  This seems like a pretty clear cut shill bidder so I reported the seller to Ebay.

I did pay for the auction as I agreed to pay up to that amount for the items and wouldn't have a problem with the price if it were honest auction competition.  I'm pretty pissed about it though.  In your opinion, is this grounds for a neg?  Is there any chance Ebay will ever look into this and punish the seller?

Quick update:  I called Ebay at u/MarianaA19's suggestion and they agree that shill bidding activity is going on and ""will take action on the account holder"".",11,13,2016-10-30,EBAY,0.039873432368040085,0.9336878061294556,0.026438772678375244
Ebay,Seller sent expensive item to wrong address. eBay closed case with no refund. Please help!,"About two weeks ago I ordered a $500 tablet from eBay. The seller shipped out the package a few days later using Fedex overnight. The tracking shows it arriving in my town but does not show my exact home address anywhere in the info. No package was left at my door and there was no knock. I even have photo proof of me at home right when the tracking info says it was delivered. A few more days went by and I called Fedex and they said while it was delivered to an address in my town, the address on the package was different to mine and they wouldn't tell me where it was. I tried contacting the seller but got no response. Then I had eBay support take over but my case was closed the same day because ""We received tracking information from the seller that shows the item was delivered to your address"". The tracking info shows that it was delivered to my town but not my address! Clearly according to Fedex, the seller put a wrong address on my package. What can I do now to get a refund?

Ebay,"DVDs New and Sealed off spindles, Buyer wants refund","Hi all, need your help...

I sold 10 Disney DVDs on eBay as new, because they were all still sealed. The guy who bought them sells DVDs professionally on eBay and wants to sell them on individually. Problem is they arrive and apparently are all but one off the spindle in the case so the discs are loose. He's holding me to ransom for a half refund or trying to return them where I have to pay shipping. Should I refund half, try to work it out (maybe offer him $20 which would be about 33%) or try to fight it as they are new and sealed, they could have all come loose during shipping?

Who's in the right here? I'm pretty sure if I don't let him return them and it goes to an eBay case thing then he's going to end up with all the money and the DVDs and don't want that to happen. Ideally I don't want the DVDs back either!

Any advice appreciated.

Edit: Thanks for the advice, guys! I ended up not giving him anything, called eBay who said they'd almost certainly side with me as they're not defective, so he raised a case and guess what? In 13 minutes eBay sided with him! So at least I get everything back and can sort the issue out and try to resell.
