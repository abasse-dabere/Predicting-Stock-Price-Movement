Ebay,Buyer wants to return a $1800 Rolex stating the pictures do not match the item but they do. Im looking for some guidance on how to proceed.,"Ill start off buy saying I work at a golf course selling clubs and shafts so we do not typically sell items with this much value so i do not want to mess anything up. 


The buyer sent us a return request with her reason being the watch she received did not match the pictures in the listing. The listing is for a stainless steel watch and the listing very clearly states that it is stainless steel. The pictures are very detailed and high resolution and the pictures are in fact of the watch she received.  She says they are pictures are of a different watch. I nicely explained that we do not nor have we ever had a different watch to take pictures of and She even mentioned how even though the listing title and description stated that it was a stainless steel watch, she thought the pictures made it look gold so she purchased it thinking it was gold. She did not message us asking about it before hand. 


I messaged her telling her this and explained to her that most likely her monitor and that made the watch appear a different color. I also explained to her that we have a %10 restocking fee in place for this item to make sure buyers made sure they wanted this watch so we would not have to deal with returns on this item but we do have a 30 day return policy. 



She messaged us back saying she would not be willing to pay the %10 restocking fee but she would pay the return shipping. My question is can we enforce the %10 fee? I do kinda feel bad but this is in no way our fault and i almost feel that she thought she was getting a deal from us and once she received the watch and realized it was listed properly she would just return it. 



I called ebay but they were not real helpful so i thought i would ask here for some advice before I proceed. Any advice is appreciated greatly.",31,16.0,2017-11-01,EBAY,0.031695738434791565,0.9223915934562683,0.045912694185972214

Ebay,Fedex repackaged box during shipping,"Shipping a bike, it has very nice carbon wheels. 

I packed it fine. 

Fedex decided to repack it in the middle of shipping. 

They put the rear wheel so that the gears scratched up a part of the bike, and the rear wheel got some bad tears in the carbon. Easily $500+ in damage. 

I purchased the label using Bikeflights, which resells Fedex labels for people shipping bikes. I purchased what is apparently just ""declared value"" through them, $3000 worth. I've been calling them but no one answers the phone. 

Fedex says I have to talk to Bikeflights, and that they will deny all claims since I packed the box, not them. Even though they repacked it mid transit...

Ebay,Warranty by Seller - Useless if you can't actually contact them after 90 days.,"Caveat emptor am I right ?

I recently purchased an item on ebay.  The store front lists a 1 year limited warranty by seller and the items has stopped working properly.

It's now 4 months since the purchase and I am just realizing there is no way to actually contact the seller to make a warranty claim.   

The ""Contact Seller"" buttons on ebay all lead into an infinite loop where is takes you to five questions, one if which is a generic option to contact sellect, which takes you to your messages, looks up the contact id, which takes you to a ""Contact Seller"" button, which takes you back to the 5 questions.

In other words, once the 90 days is up, you are on your own.

I just contacted ebay and they have volunteered to send the reseller a message, but that's all they will do.  As a matter of fact is seems to me they are ACTIVELY trying to hide this seller and help them avoid taking responsibility.

So lesson learned on my part.  Purchasing electronics on ebay is just a bad idea, fraught with frustration.  The amount I saved on this purchase vs buying new from a factory authorized store will be more that consumed by the amount I am going to have to pay to get this item working.

So caveat emptor.  If you are buying an item on eBay, i would factor in purchasing the extended warranty.  In my case, if I had done that I would have made more sense to just purchase from an authorized distributor or my local store.",12,6.0,2017-11-01,EBAY,0.16434317827224731,0.8144606947898865,0.021196164190769196
Ebay,Unsure About Seller's Behavior,"I've been using eBay for almost 5 years now, off and on, and I've never had a bad experience before. I am having an issue with a seller, and I can't figure out if the seller is breaking eBay's Terms of Service. I'm hoping you guys might have some insight on what I should do.

I ordered an item (an old Marvel Legends action figure) from a relatively new seller, and a few days later they messaged me and asked me to be patient, as they didn't have the item on hand and implied that the listing used a stock image and the item was a custom order instead of an original as advertised. I checked their feedback, and noticed that they had a recent negative feedback about using stock images that did not represent the actual item. The way the seller got defensive when I brought it up made it seem like they do not fully understand how the buying and selling practices on eBay work. 

It's now past when the item was supposed to be delivered and it still has yet to be shipped, so I've requested a refund. Should I also contact eBay about this seller? My gut says that they are violating the Terms of Service, but I'm not sure if there's some loophole they are exploiting.

I apologize for how long my post is, but I wanted to include all relevant info. Any information or advice you could give would be greatly appreciated.",6,5.0,2017-11-01,EBAY,0.06286325305700302,0.8925970196723938,0.04453971982002258
Ebay,How are sellers shipping within the U.S. for under $2?,"I was just looking at listing for a 2"" by 2"" by 2"" adapter selling for $2.16. The seller included free shipping and is shipping from within the U.S.

Does anyone know how it's possible to ship so cheaply?

I included the dimensions to be clear that it's not a flat item that can be included in a regular envelope with a stamp.

I ask because if I ship the lightest package I can weigh (1 ounce) via the cheapest method I can find (first class), it's $2.61 via Ebay--even after their built-in discount.

To that end, I'm trying to understand if there's a way to get shipping for under $2--as I'm not sure how else sellers could be selling things for $2.16 and still making a profit.

Ebay,Double check your FVF credits!,"In another thread the other day someone mentioned they weren't sure if you get your Final Value Fees credited on returns. I looked into mine today and in many cases, it was automatically refunded when the return was complete. However, I found that nearly half of them weren't.

It seemed to be instances in which there was an irregularity with the return such as a false INAD claim (which as a concierge member, I can refuse to refund shipping), or ones where the buyer never input the tracking and I had the case closed but eventually received the item back and issued the refund. In both of the cases, it looks like this just closes the return but eBay script isn't triggering the FVF refund.

As such, I called in today and got over $200 back in FVFs.

If you want to check to see if you've gotten your credits

* Click on the ""My EBay"" in the upper right on most pages. 

* Then hit Summary from the dropdown. 

* There's an account tab that you can go to from there. 

* Under Account Summary, there's a link for ""Credits"". 

* Click that and you can see just the credits that were applied to the invoices for the time frame you have selected.

* You can search the listing number for any item you have questions about and should see a negative number associated with it in the credits column.

Ebay,What to do when buyer is extremely difficult?,"Hello all,

Wondering if I could have some counsel.

Been doing eBay for many years now casually, never had an issue.  

I sold a high end smartphone in like new condition (listed as used), and sent everything as described to the buyer.

The phone truly was in like new, mint condition.  No scratches.  Cosmetically beautiful.  Tested, everything working fully.

Immediately he opened a return case and said the item was NAD, then realized he made a mistake and it was the correct model, closed the return immediately after (opened and closed the return within an hour).  

He then said the phone ""met all of his expectations"", he just wanted to test out the battery life. 

I let him know a few tips about how to make battery life work best with this phone, charging, etc.  

Over a week goes by, and I get a message asking me if ""I knew there was screen burn in"" on the phone.

He sends me images of the top of the phone where the status bar would be, and he has a fully white background on the phone, saying that ""when the screen in fully white or grey, you can see the top is **slightly different** where the battery icon is"".

The phone has an AMOLED screen so some ""burn in"" would be normal for a used phone, however I TESTED this before sending it, and there was NONE.  

Regardless, even if there was ""slightly different"" appearance at the top where the status bar is, I don't see who would care, because the status bar is there!

I guarantee, however, that there was none such issue.  I watched videos fullscreen with this phone.  I looked at images fullscreen.  Never ever had any problem like this. 

I honestly found it hard to part with this phone because it really was an excellent, high end (still extremely high end!) smartphone.

Every single used phone would have this issue anyway.  Regardless, the phone was in mint condition, I checked it before sending it.  

I wish I could show you the picture.  It looks like nothing is there.  

I am a reasonable person and have been using eBay for over a decade, buying and selling.

I believe at this point he is having buyers remorse very significantly and is trying to get a refund.  Refund period is up in two days.

He asked if he could use the warranty.  Phone company said he could.

I responded with all of the warranty information that is transferrable to him.  I have an extra year of insurance.  I called the company who makes the phone, they said absolutely they could fix it for him with the warranty.

He replies back to me (after giving him the warranty information) that he is going to give me a video of the problem because I don't understand.  

Why does he not use the warranty?  They will give him a brand new one.  He asked for the warranty, and I gave it to him.  

I called eBay and was already told I would be fine (except for negative feedback) because he already opened and closed a return.  

My worry, however, is PayPal.

Can he open a SNAD case with PayPal for ""slight screen burn in of the status bar"" that arguably doesn't even exist?

This is driving me crazy, I would really appreciate any advice or opinions!

I wish I had sold it to someone ""normal"", if you know what I mean.  Someone who actually wanted the phone and wasn't pulling my chain.  

Thanks in advance.",12,3.0,2017-11-02,EBAY,0.033834729343652725,0.9293069243431091,0.03685838729143143

Ebay,Ebay hides certain search results which for me is a huge problem,"I was searching for a game the other day and it showed me a listing with what I would consider a fairly acceptable price for that particular game, still I've seen the game go for slightly less so I added the listing to my watch list to sort of save it in case the game shows up cheaper.

For the past few days I've been searching for the game on ebay, setting the filter to lowest cost and shipping as I normally do and THAT one particular listing never shows up anymore. Of course the game isn't sold and hasn't ended.

I've noticed this over the past year or so, sometimes I have to search over and over for a listing I found once to show up again even tho I always use the same exact search conditions.

I know that sometimes ebay omits similar results for god knows what reason, but when it does this it shows a yellow notification that it's done it and you can filter out of that.
But when it refuses to show listings I KNOW are there it doesn't notify you or anything.

So god knows how much stuff I'm actually missing I could be buying at better prices.",14,15.0,2017-11-04,EBAY,0.04513905942440033,0.9126927852630615,0.04216814786195755
Ebay,Pretty sure this buyer of mine is fishing for ANY reason for a return. How do I deal with returns?,"Sold an item and the buyer left a good review, thanked me and said everything works. Buyer sent me some pics of the box. Large USPS priority flat mail box. Its ripped completely on the side, smashed in holes everywhere. I say to complain to USPS and I can do the same since those boxes are insured by default. Buyer declines. I tell him did any of the small items fall out. Says no. I asked if any damage to product, says no. Buyer then used the product and it works fine. Couple days pass and the buyer is complaining about non issue things. Its an old electronic, buyer complains it doesnt have X modern feature, explain politely why the buyer is wrong. New complaint follows, explain why buyer is wrong again. New complaint, repeat. The issues the item has dont make sense either. Like saying the car wont start every time the cup holder is out. There is no electronic function of the cup holder, or connection to the engine, so its 100000% not the cup holder causing the issue for example.

The messages are getting more and more desperate and I am 100% convinced the buyer will try and screw me out of my sale. Honestly I think he ripped the box itself. I cant believe USPS did it then continued to ship it and NOTHING fell out, or got damaged in that condition shipping from me (west coast) to the buyer (east coast)

I have perfect feedback so far all dealing with selling this item. I even have thank you messages from them and repeat buyers saying how wonderful it was to deal with me, how nicely things are packed. Though I am sure none of this helps me since I see many complaints about how Ebay ""hates"" their sellers.

So how do I deal with returns, who pays shipping, what if I get the item and it works, or is purposely broken or anything suspicious with it, wrong item, etc? Does ebay really screw sellers even if the seller is right? The buyer left me good reviews and everything and said it worked, until the petty criticisms, all addressed in the listing, then the weird complaints that dont make sense, then a conveniently new even more confusing issue arrives.

I dont mind the return, I still have the money for it, but this is very annoying.

EDIT: 

Also the buyer insisted on communicating with me directly though my email and his and not though ebay. Thats where the pics of the box was sent to me. Where all the above info took place. I told him I never use the email and just to use ebay which is where he just contacted me with more odd complaints.",7,6.0,2017-11-04,EBAY,0.15416720509529114,0.8208764791488647,0.02495633065700531

Ebay,Need some advice...,"The run-down:

Buyer buys a handheld console, 3DS XL. Buyer opens a claim nearly 3 weeks later asking for a refund. Reason for refund: ""item was packaged poorly and the hinge was broken"". I ask buyer to send item back. Upon inspection, first thing I notice is that original packaging is flawless (literally, flawless, like I had just shipped it that very day). Inside is a smashed retail box with an even worse-looking 3DS XL with a broken hinge as well as multiple deep (like mega-deep) scratches on the outer shell. I respond to the case asking eBay to reconsider because I believe the buyer broke the item, be it intentional or not, and then tried to return the item under false pretenses. I offer pictures of the original packaging (again, flawless) and of the damage that they failed to mention as well as the damage they did and tried to explain that there was no way the item was damaged in transit because the (flawless) packaging was completely intact. eBay decided that there was not enough proof that the buyer actually caused the damage and proceeded to refund them in full.

I guess this a two-part question. 

First, does anyone here agree with what eBay did? I know it might not change anything, but am I the only who thinks this is a little messed up?

Ebay,Find a user by their real name or address? (long explanation in post),"Hello all, I'm hoping someone can help me out. Is there a way I can find a seller if all I have is their real name or address?

My Grandmother passed last Thanksgiving, and my grandfather passed away recently within the past month or so. They had 4 children my 2 aunts my uncle and my mom. My mother lives far away while the other 3 live within an hours drive of my Grandparents home. 

They haven't yet read the will or begun the process of liquidation of the Estate however lots of stuff has gone missing from the home. I know my one aunt is an avid Ebayer and has a good eye for whats valuable. Id like to find her eBay account so I can monitor whats being sold.

It boils my blood that my Grand parents home has been ransacked in this fashion, especially because they explicitly said they didn't want this to happen. My two aunts aren't speaking to each other and my uncle is off his rocker as well. My mother has remained neutral through the whole thing but I can tell its really starting to get to her.

To be clear the point of tracking down the ebay page is less about the stuff/money and more about the principle of the matter. My aunt has actually admitted taking some items(very valuable) claiming that she had purchased them at a yard sale and given them to my grandparents as gifts. Funnily enough theres pictures of said aunt as a preteen where these heirlooms are in the background of the photos. So clearly a fabrication. 

In all honesty some of these items would have ended up sold any way, however I think its wrong that my mother aunt and uncle are being swindled out of an already VERY small inheritance.

Any help bringing this **** to justice would be greatly appreciated.

Also is there a way to see all prior auctions so I could see anything that has been sold through the past year?

To make matters worse the aunt in question is the Executor of the estate.",6,2.0,2017-11-05,EBAY,0.05395159497857094,0.917766809463501,0.028281623497605324

1.  If the buyer never responds would I have a case for having the feedback removed seeing as though I did send the correct size?

Ebay,PSA - UK / EU Sellers - Update UPC/EAN/ISBN/Manufacturer Part Number or face losing all sales/listing data!,"I'm a UK Business seller with all of my listings set to ""Good til' Cancelled"", so when the item time runs out every 30 days it automatically re-lists the item and keeps all of my ""sold"" date, reviews etc on the item. 

However, I woke up this morning and noticed that one of my items had dropped into the ""Unsold"" category, which should of course never happen. I called eBay and explained what had happened and they agreed that it was very odd and that it was not something they had ever seen before. They went away to check and called me back approx. 15 minutes later with the answer. 

They explained that as the item was missing vital listing information (the product manufacturer part number) that the item was automatically pulled from eBay and was unable to be re-listed. 

Baring in mind that they were stumped as to the issue, this is obviously a brand new thing and a brand new problem they are experiencing. As a result of this, I have had to re-list the item as a brand new listing and have lost all of my sales data for the item and all reviews. This is obviously VERY annoying as reviews and previous sales are a HUGE influence for customers and now this is all lost. 

Fortunately for me it was only 1 item, however I have 4 ending today and the same would have happened to all of these listings. 

Ebay have made no attempt to contact me regarding this issue and I know for a fact it is happening to other sellers. I IMPLORE you, check your listing information to ensure you are compliant with this new rule they are failing to mention.

Ebay,"The day after I leave a buyer positive feedback, he opens an ""I didn't authorize this purchase"" dispute...","Long story short:
2 weeks ago, I sell a game. The game is delivered last week. I leave the buyer positive feedback on Monday. He opens a dispute in PayPal against me on Tuesday, saying that they did not authorize the purchase.

Now this is where it gets confusing. I log into PayPal and obviously the funds are on hold. I click to view the case details, and it says ""the buyer is disputing a payment you received of $1,144.17"". The game they purchased from me was for $24.97. Does anyone have any idea what this is about? I've never had a PayPal dispute against me, and only twice through eBay, both of which went in my favor. 

Is the $1,144.17 the total of my sale plus many other sales from other sellers? I do not believe this case is legit, because out of 62 feedbacks left for other people, 14 were negative and 2 were neutral. I honestly think he's trying to scam me through PayPal since eBay will (should, lol) automatically side with me since I shipped and printed the label straight from eBay, and it was confirmed delivered.

Any insight would be great, and thank you guys ahead of time!

Ebay,What You May Experience When Calling eBay,"1,718 feedback as of right now; 75% selling, 25% buying. Just wanted to let any newer members know what it's like to call eBay as I do it at least monthly.

- Called
- 4 minutes wait time (pretty fast)
- Screening to verify my account: 5 questions (address, phone number, etc)
- What happened: Sold item, buyer opened case to return because of remorse. 11/6 was their ship deadline. 11/8 and item hasn’t been shipped. Case is almost 2 weeks old now. 
- Case ID
- Transfer to colleague/superior 
- New person answered
- Screening: 5 questions (spelling out my name and username this time)
- What happened again
- Case ID
- Another screening question confirming my name vs my username (getting annoyed here)
- Asked if I wanted to escalate (Nah, but I'd like a number 9 please, large.)
- On hold for 4 minutes
- Case goes on for 10 more days. They are ‘forcing’ a return so he has 10 days or I win the case. The first case was closed and now an escalated case is open. Buyer can’t message me through there or upload tracking. They said that he will either message me it or they will send me a message with it. eBay is paying for return shipping; I guess that’s the ‘force’ in ‘force return.’ 

Total length: 24 minutes, 2 seconds

“We asked the buyer to return the item to you for a refund.

When the tracking details show that the item is delivered, we’ll refund the buyer. As a result, we'll either debit your PayPal account or charge your reimbursement payment method.”

Overall pretty problem free. Never too much of a pain in the ass dealing with them. Just wish some of them were more educated about the technical details. I had to ask multiple times where I'd get return tracking; if the case was closed how could he upload it? She had to ask someone but pretty much he can only message me or she said she would.

Ebay,"Buyer lost eBay case but managed to get PayPal to file for refund one month later, now I’m out ~$2,400. Any advice?","RESOLVED: PAYPAL RESOLVED THE DISPUTE IN MY FAVOR AND EBAY CREDITED ME THE SALE FEES!

So I️ recently sold a basically new 2017 MacBook Pro 13” with a Magic Mouse, magic keyboard, and a usb-c to usb-3 adapter. I️ sent the package to a buyer in San Jose, CA and according to the shipping status it was “DELIVERED LEFT WITH INDIVIDUAL”. The buyer contacted me and said they never received it. USPS shows the signature for the package as some sort of chicken scratch so giving the buyer the benefit of the doubt I️ figured maybe it was stolen. I️ spent countless hours instructing the buyer on ways to find out where it ended up and even told them to contact the Post Master because if you never got a knock on the door, somethings up. I️ contacted eBay and they instructed me to tell the buyer to open a “Stolen From Porch Claim” to further investigate the “disappearance” of the package. Instead the buyer opened a claim against me saying they never received the packed which eBay ruled in my favor and said they did. All was quite for exactly a month from the sale date when I️ receive an email form PayPal saying they are processing the refund for this buyer. My thought exactly, how can they do that when it’s already been resolved through eBay. Turns out the buyer filed a claim it looks like with their financial institution and action was taken. As of now I️ am currently out $900+ because PayPal auto withdrew to cover an outstanding balance in my account from the refund and the $1500 I️ spent on the MacBook and it’s accessories totaling ~$2,400 in losses. None of this is apparent to eBay so I️ have recently filed a claim against the buyer. eBay is requesting I️ pay $98 in fees by a set date or they will send me to collections. First thing in the morning I️ am going to call eBay because this is absolutely ridiculous and secondly PayPal. My question is what do I️ do from here? Does eBay seller protection protect against this? Can I️ get the fees waved? Any support will help.

Ebay,Buyer asked to ship to a different address with a twist...,"So I know it's a pretty common post here on r/eBay, but I have a weird case that maybe I could get some advice on.

This guy just bought an item from me with a new-ish account (3 feedback) and then immediately messaged me saying ""shoot I'm really sorry but I typed my address wrong into eBay when I made this account and haven't fixed it yet. It's 13 made-up St. Not 16 made-up St. So if you could just ship it to the right address so I don't have to bother my neighbor, I would appreciate it thanks!""

Obviously I believe the guy, I doubt his neighbor stole his account to buy things, but I don't want to lose my Seller protection. So I told him I would either have to cancel the order and he could rebuy it with the fixed address, or he  could just pick it up from his neighbors house. 

He reponded very angrily saying I was a terrible seller and couldn't accommodate the ""smallest of requests"" as well as using several explitives. 

So my questions are, would it be so bad to lose my seller protection to a guy who I believe isn't lying about the address thing, and if it is, if I cancel his order could he still leave me a negative?

Ebay,I (buyer) threatened with mail fraud - now what?,"I've been on ebay since 1998. Never had an issue with 1000ish transactions. I have 100% feedback. Then I run into this guy...

I bought a couple zwave light switches from ebay. They were listed as ""New"". They delivered last Friday. On Saturday I open the package to install them. As soon as I opened the package I noticed the light switch boxes had been opened. 

Pull the units out, go to install the 1st one - one of the screw heads that one of the electrical wires connects to was broken off. No way of getting it out. I put the unit aside and pull out the other switch. I've installed 4 or 5 of these switches that I've bought new from AMZ, and as soon as I opened this box, I could tell the plastic inside wasn't the same - it was basically a baggie. 

I hook the second switch up, and it won't work. I contact the seller, and he says for me to return the units and I can get a refund. I open a return and he provided free returns so I printed his label and returned them. 

Wednesday, I get a message stating ""The units that you returned were not the ones we sent you. Also, one unit is missing instruction manual, flyer and the second is missing screws and a switch cover."" There is NO WAY the units I sent back to him were different. Those darn things are expensive, so I only buy a couple at a time. I didn't have any others in the house to switch.

I email him back and tell him there must be a mistake somewhere. He asks for my phone # and I send it to him. He starts blowing up my phone. About 5 calls in 10 mins. Then he messages me ""You are failing to answer our calls to correct this matter. We are in contact with eBay and the fraud team. We have researched your number and found it to be a fraudulent number."" 

I've had this number for years - his claim is ridiculous. Since I was at work, I finished my meeting, and then went and call him. He told me he was going to give me the opportunity to fix the situation. He wanted me to close the return immediately. Then he would send me the two units back. I would correct the boxes and then return them back to him. 

At this point, I have no idea if I missed putting in some of the parts or not. So when i asked him about the switched units he starts saying they photograph their items before they are sent and he knows I returned the wrong ones. I tell him that's not possible. However, he just goes back to ""I'm giving you a chance to fix this situation by you closing the return....(back thru the story again)."" Everytime I ask about it being ""New"" items but the boxes were open, he says they absolutely were brand new. 

After getting no where, I tell him I'll do it. He then says I needed to close the return immediately while he was on the phone. I told him that wasn't possible. Then he said it needed to be done within 24 hours. 

I called eBay that night. Spoke to 2 CSR's (in another country) and they just said, I did everything I should have and to just wait until 7 days have passed and they will automatically issue the refund. They said not to respond to him.  

Since Wednesday, this guy calls me at least 7 times a day. He leaves  voicemails about every other call. Keeps saying they are documenting everything. Today, he leaves a message stating that if I don't correct the situation today he's going to file mail fraud charges and pursue legal action. 

What should I do? IF I did leave out the parts, It's probably $5 in parts AT MOST. There is NO WAY I switched the switches. I had no other switches. Do I ignore the guy? Do I go buy a new switch and send him the couple missing parts with signature required delivery and be done with it? My concern is if I send that he's then going to say I switched the switches too. I don't know what to do at the moment. Thanks.",12,3.0,2017-11-11,EBAY,0.10793495178222656,0.8664465546607971,0.025618480518460274

Ebay,Should I give negative feedback?,"I've ebayed since 1999 and have never had a bad buy until now.

Ebay,Seller trying to get refund on Graphics card,"Hey guys,

I sold my ASUS RX 580 recently in the mining craze on eBay (in June), and the buyer just opened a case against me today claiming that the item is defective and is requesting a refund. His message is: “the manufacturer reported that the warranty does not extend to a video card resold by a person (first buyer)”. So he wants to send it back for a refund. I think I’m being scammed. Any advice?

Thanks in advance 

EDIT: The item was sold on eBay, but the case was opened on PayPal. 

EDIT 2: after his original message, I offered twice to help the buyer file for a warranty claim with the manufacturer by providing him whatever information he needs (invoice, receipt, etc) to process the warranty claim. He declined and escalated it to PayPal review. Crossing my fingers that they don't screw me over

Ebay,"To INAD or not, am I just being too picky?","So I purchased a phone a few days ago. Listing states 'professionally refurbished' phone, 'B+ quality' that is in 'Very good condition' and that it will come 'professionally packaged in a box with accessories'. Well, it came yesterday. No box, just a phone in a bubble mailer with a generic charger. The phone is beat up. All four corners are well worn, the silver is worn away and shows a lot of white plastic underneath, and one corner is clearly dented (like someone dropped it on that corner and broke the screen). There are also a bunch of chips in the plastic surrounding the screen. If I had to guess, this is a very used phone with a broken screen that was replaced. Not what I expected based on the item description in the listing.

I am a seller and do not buy very often, so I am a little hesitant to file an INAD claim (I hate when people INAD me without at least contacting me first), but does this sound like a case where an INAD is justified or am I being too picky? I could just as easily return it, it shipped First Class so I would only be out like $7, but I don't see that I should be on the hook for that since I feel the description did not properly describe what I was purchasing.

Ebay,Paypal Dispute from Ebay Help,"My friend recently sold an item on Ebay (an unopened, vintage toyset with very minor wear to be exact) with no returns. The buyer has paid via PayPal and received the box, but was not satisfied with it due to a pic of receiving it with a slight bend on the box bottom in which he claims it won't stand up. (Two quick notes: my friend has video proof of packing that he didn't cause it, and the listed condition AFAIK does not guarantee the box needs to stand up perfectly. All contents are accounted for.) Ebay has investigated and sided with my seller friend (buyer's remorse and unjustified complaint), but now the buyer has opened a dispute with PayPal for a refund.

PayPal is currently investigating, but hasn't asked for any proof from my seller friend nor about Ebay's decision. Is there anything my friend can do to help his case in a PayPal dispute as a seller when he has Ebay and video evidence as proof?

This is all inside the United States. Please delete this post if it is not relevant enough for Ebay.


Edit: Sorry I forgot to mention, he did make a call to PayPal for the dispute and they told him to wait, but be prepared for a refund. They didn't seem interested in the closed Ebay case in the seller's favor, but he can push for it to be considered.

I've also posted the situation on PayPal's subreddit to get their perspective on disputes.

**Update**: My friend called PayPal again and talked to a different representative. My friend gave him pics of his box's condition as well as a pic/html of the Ebay case page. So far it sounds like PayPal may side with my friend in giving no refund to the buyer.

Hello (name), Im sorry to hear your having troubles with the power button on your new iPhone X!

Ive talked to apple support and they said If you went there, they would replace the unit with a brand new one on the spot under warranty! If your up for this, I can email you the receipt and you can get your phone replaced today! This way, you wouldn't have to wait about a week for the phone to ship back to me and for your refund to go through, after it arrives back. Please let me know if you are willing to do this!

Ebay,Am I being scammed? This seems a little shady.,"I purchased an Apple Watch from a Canadian seller for about $90 and it was completely unlocked from Find My iPhone, there was an issue with the display, so I didn't think it was too good to be true.

The seller has been a member since 2000, and has over 100 reputation points on eBay. However, in the last 12 months, he has only had 4 feedback left for him.

The Apple Watch I bought was listed twice before, once on November 13th, and the other time on November 6th.

Both times, the watch was sold to the same buyer, who had 42 feedback (eBay censors usernames, this is how I deduce it was the same person). He had left positive feedback saying the product was as described, and that the seller's communication was excellent. Now, the Apple Watch appeared for sale again, and it was purchased by me, about a day or so after it was listed. It was a Buy it Now/Auction listing, and two people had already bid on the item.

Could it be an error, and the seller may have accidentally relisted the item, or is it something more elaborate?",17,8.0,2017-11-18,EBAY,0.0531407967209816,0.9171249270439148,0.02973424457013607

Ebay,"Bad buyer, should I be worried?","A while back I sold a vintage piggy bank. In my listing I mentioned that it had a rubber stopper. Buyer buys it, they sending me an angry message saying that I lied and that it's not vintage because of the rubber stopper. They got a full refund and kept the item for the sake of keeping the piece. They felt and that I gave them a full refund so I gave them the option to pay me what they wanted. They followed up with a message saying that I was trying to scam them and that they never got the refund. I told them I was done and that they were being rude after I had been trying to give them good customer service. 

Fast forward to last night. I decided to catch up on my feedback and there's was one of them. I couldn't give them negative feedback so I was honest in my ""positive"" feedback over our transaction. They got pissed off and told me to change it or they would report me to eBay. I ended up calling eBay and they said that if I'm going to leave a positive feedback that the text needs to be positive as well. To this I replied that they want me to be honest in my listings so I'm going to be honest in my feedback as well. They guy I talked to kinda shooed me away and ended the conversation without asking if everything had been resolved, have a nice day, etc.

I message the buyer and tell her that the transaction is 100% complete and that I can't do anything else about it and that she would have to contact eBay. I told them to stop harassing me and that I would forward all messages to eBay and file a report.

She later replied by saying the eBay fixed it and that ""they are aware of me""

So what in the world could she mean that ""they are aware of me""? Should I even be worried as to what crazy talk she told them? Part of me wants to call and find out what they meant. But should I even be concerned with this crazy talk?

On a separate note, it's bs that eBay favors the buyers this much. They actually removed honest  feedback meant to warn other members, like feedback is supposed to be, and just let them have their way? It's ridiculous!

Tl;dr 
Sold something, seller was upset because they didn't read the full description, gave refund and kept item. Left feedback 2 months later, they got upset and sent a message demanding it be changed, I called eBay, they said that positive feedback needs positive text. They called eBay, had the feedback removed, said that ""they are aware of me"". Should I be worried?

I then scheduled a redelivery attempt for Mon Nov 20, and it never showed out for delivery but it was marked as delivered at 3:41 pm. I was home at this time when the mail got here and no package was delivered, however I did get other mail from USPS.

I am kind of panicking here because I was looking it up on eBay forums and people say that once the carrier marks the package as delivered, you have no recourse from eBay or the seller, and it's out of their hands.

I checked with a couple neighbors and they didn't receive it, but I will check with the rest on my cul-de-sac tomorrow morning.

For those that responded, thank you! I appreciate it. The buyer, after receiving a request for photos, did a 180 and now all is copacetic. For those of you who recommended filing an insurance claim, I slept on it and would likely have taken that route if I had received photos of damage.

I received payment for a laptop I had for sale. I checked the package before I mailed it and ensured everything looked ok. Mailed it out.

I get a message stating that the screen is cracked and there's stuff missing.

Now, I know this isn't true, but I have no idea what to do next. I'm majorly stressing out.

Advice is appreciated, folks.",19,1.0,2017-11-21,EBAY,0.03553856909275055,0.9212387800216675,0.043222639709711075

Ebay,"I was scammed, recieved a refund from ebay and the case was closed. Now the seller is asking for the item to be returned...","About a month ago I purchased a new cell phone off of ebay, despite my better judgement. I got the IMEI number before hand, and checked with Bell to see if it was reported as lost or stolen, if it was still on a plan, etc, and they told me it was all good to go so I bought it. It worked great for 2 days before being reported as stolen and blacklisted. 

I opened a case through ebay and tried to initiate a return through the seller, but after a couple of messages where they played dumb about the issue, they stopped responding. I sent a few more messages (I had no problem sending the phone back, and it was still in perfect condition, I just wanted my money back), got no response and the case was escalated. After a 5 day period where ebay tried to get the seller to send me a return shipping label and failed, they ruled the case in my favor, fully refunded me the money and the case was closed. I'm assuming that the seller didn't respond to the ebay reps either and just hoped that the issue would go away. It's now been over a week I believe since I was issued the refund, and the seller has just contacted me asking for me to return the phone, and sent me a shipping label. 

So what I want to know is this: Do I have to send the phone back to them? I'm not even using it all, it's just sitting on my counter in the box because I needed a phone, not a wifi-only brick. But this person tried to either scam me or sell me a stolen item. And then they ignored my polite attempts to get a refund. And if I do send the phone back, it's probably likely (although this is just speculation) that they'll try to scam someone else. And of course they wasted a ton of my time and caused a lot of stress. So even though I'm not using it, I don't want to send it back to them.",24,8.0,2017-11-22,EBAY,0.23040276765823364,0.7444511651992798,0.025146057829260826

Ebay,My Experience with the Guaranteed Delivery Program,"TL;DR: there is a feedback loophole that allows buyers to leave negative feedback for INR requests that are now closed (no longer in the seller's favor but not in the buyer's favor) when the item is scanned as delivered after the guaranteed delivery date. 

I have two stores on eBay and process a few hundred transactions monthly.  Opting into the program for the discounted fees was easy since we already offer free expedited shipping and handle the majority of purchases the same-day, the rest next-day.  

A buyer opened an Item Not Received request against us, despite a delivery scan, saying they never received their item.  In these situations, they used to be decided in the seller's favor when there is a delivery scan, even if it is late and we have advised buyers the steps to take in order to receive a refund.  

Unfortunately for us, the delivery scan was one day beyond the guaranteed date and I had to call into eBay to attempt to remove the negative feedback the buyer left after they did not receive the resolution/refund they were after.  It was my understanding that sellers had protection when the items are shipped and scanned within the promised time, and that protection should have included feedback as well.

The Service Representatives I spoke to in the Feedback and GDP departments expressed surprise that was not the case when the buyer was able to leave negative feedback. At first, the Feedback Rep said he was able to remove the feedback as a courtesy since he was able to do so for other sellers in similar instances (INR decided in seller's favor).  However, since the inception of Guaranteed Delivery, cases (for now) are no longer decided in the seller's favor and are just closed in general, exposing the negative feedback loophole. The Feedback Rep mentioned that since I am now armed with this information, any future negative feedback would not be removed and said he would advance this issue to leadership and later transferred me over to a Guaranteed Delivery Representative. 

The GDP Rep also expressed surprise and mentioned he would do the same thing with his leadership.  I communicated to both of them if this issue were to remain, the future of the Guaranteed Delivery Program would be in doubt because buyers now have even more power to affect marketplaces and sellers would be cautious about this feedback exposure.

I was given a reference number I have once followed up with and will try again after the weekend.  My participation is now in doubt because I have to weigh the loss of exposure on search results against undeserved and previously removable negative feedback.  If there is enough interest, I'd be happy to post an update.",16,16.0,2017-11-23,EBAY,0.0899147167801857,0.8847143054008484,0.0253710076212883

Ebay,"USPS item marked as delivered, but buyer magically never received it - Anything to be done here?","I want to report the buyer for the sake of other eBay sellers that this person may buy from and rip off in the future. (Since we can't leave negative feedback anymore - as far as I know)

MAIN QUESTION: If I do report the buyer, will eBay be looking at my product this person bought but ""never received"" and then start to look into my selling history and possibly flag my account? I don't want to put my account or listing at risk or jeopardize it.

What I'm selling isn't bad or illegal by any means, but *sometimes* it can be frowned upon by eBay itself, but regular people / eBay users love them and have no problem. 

My listing is on the first page of 40k or so other listings (last time I checked) and is doing okay - not rich or anything from it. I have it set so it doesn't expire. It's been on there for like 8 or 9 months so far.


BACK STORY - If you guys care:

So yeah, from the dispute emails so far this buyer sounds like they have zero knowledge of how eBay truly works. They have a low number of things bought or sold as well. So definitely a noob or throwaway scam type account.

I don't really care since we've sold a few hundred things so far and it was only $13 bucks. So it's been paid for many times over by other, more decent honest eBay buyers.

Person stated ""I'm sure the mailman sent it to the wrong house on the next street over with the same house number. I'd go over there and get it but that house has a registered sex offender!"" Wow, how convenient is that?! 

Not to judge, but from the way it was worded (I rewrote it so it's easier to read) I'm just gonna assume hard drugs or low life swindler or something.

I'm assuming they actually received my item since 99.9% of our other eBay sales got to customers just fine.

But yeah, whatever I'm basically over it. $13 dollars isn't going to bankrupt me so I will probably do a straight refund, since i can already tell this person will be sending me 20 more emails in a row over the next 2 days if they don't get their way (yeah one of those kinds of people) and it's not even worth my time &amp; effort.

Ebay,"Item delivered to different address than provided to seller, claim didn't help","So, I preordered an Xbox One X a month ago through eBay for around $600. The seller (who, at the time, had 90%-ish positive feedback) would fulfill the preorder through Amazon. I payed through PayPal and received tracking info and all that, and the seller told me I'd have to sign to receive the package. I made sure my parents (it's just the three of us living here) knew I had a package coming and that someone would have to sign for it.

Since nobody in the house signed for it or saw a delivery attempt letter, I emailed the seller and received no useful info, then called my local USPS. They confirmed the item was delivered to a different address. I got vocal confirmation on the delivered address and quintuple-checked that I'd entered my info correctly in the sale, which I had. The address was one digit off, e.g. 2401 instead of 2301.

I contacted the address the package was shipped to and they denied seeing anything, but seemed shifty about it. I didn't press anything with them to and instead filed a PayPal claim. The seller provided tracking info which showed a successful delivery and closed the claim. However, I specifically mentioned that the address was not what I provided the seller, and the claim didn't take that into consideration.

Ebay,"New to selling, got a negative review. Can I salvage my eBay account?","Hi everyone. I started selling a few random things on eBay a couple of months ago, this is something I am totally new to. I sold 7 items with no issues in that time. I didn’t receive any feedback from the buyers. 

I then sold an item that the buyer left negative feedback saying that it was ‘stained and smelled of mildew’. This item was still in the manufacturer’s packaging and I did not see any stains or notice any smell. I also went back through my photos of the item and I don’t see any staining at all (the item is white) unless it is under the packaging which I can’t see through. 

Since my account is new and had no feedback this negative feedback has put my account with a negative rating below the threshold and I cannot edit any of my current listings and I am limited to 1 listing until ‘my performance raises above the threshold’.

Ebay,Double charged for a large refund on Ebay and Paypal,"A couple weeks ago, a buyer demanded a refund on a baseball card I sold him. The claim was bullshit, and made just because the buyer is extremely picky, but that's a different problem. My problem is that a refund for 1,028$ was removed from my paypal account on November 8. I didn't have that money in my account, so the account went into the red. On November 17, that same charge of $1,028 was removed from my checking account at my bank. I didn't have the full amount in there because of bills and life, so that account also went into the red for a few days. Now the paypal charge was pending until today. I figured it took time for the check or whatever to clear, and after it did, paypal released the funds back into my account. It did not. Now I'm somehow out 2,000+ for a single, 1,028$ refund. I just called paypal,a nd they said it was a mistake, that EBAY had charged me the extra fee after already charging the refund.

Ebay,How do I report a seller?,"How can I report a seller? I think he's trying to scam me.
I paid him extra to add tracking to my item, and he said he would. Then the item didnt arrive and he 'lost the receipt'
He told me I had to wait until the post office were sure it was lost before I could have a refund (how can he do that without the tracking number or receipt?). I said no thanks, I want a refund now. I got the refund, and then the item shows up, only its not the item, its a lesser version worth significantly less. 

So, being aware that he is probably going to now say I have the item and I have not paid for it, I declare ""I have this item, however it is not the item I paid for""

He almost doesn't blink in his reply, and tells me to put it in the post ""return to sender"" - this seems like a good way of me somehow becoming liable for the cost of an item that I didnt even receive. Doubt the value is high enough for the police to care, and I doubt there is enough evidence for them to get involved anyway

Ebay,Another scam post..,"I recently purchased a copy of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night from eBay.  (A game for Sony PlayStation 1)
Upon receiving the item I found it was a bootleg on a burnt disc. Obviously this is not acceptable as this was advertised as the original product (and anyone can burn a disc).  
I immediately requested a return/refund and paid to send the item back (to Taiwan). I still have the receipt for the return, but I did not pay for a tracking number.  
According to eBay because I did not pay for a tracking number I am not entitled to a refund, and they have closed my claim.  
So now I am out the $45 for the item, and extra $10 to send it back, and will not be recieving a refund.

Ebay,Seller promises to send refund if I close it,"Hi! I'm new to ebay and I would appreciate some help. Here's the thing.

1. I boght an item - if it matters it was digital door peephole for 44$ from a store in USA.
2. It arrived scratched like somebody used it, picture inside showing a man looking at it.
3. It did NOT work. I put batteries they provided-nothing. I put two new sets of batteries, still nothing.
4. I have contacted seller, though ebay and for reason I pushed refund, and sent him pictures, detailed explanation and asked for a new item or refund. He said he wants video, so I mailed video from my personal mail to him showing defected item.
7. He said okay, how about 15$ refund so you fix it in your local store and you dont have to send it back. I said no. He said 25$. I said no, explaining to him that thats not fair because he sent me broken item. Please note - I was polite the whole way. He said 38. I said final deal 44 which was item price without shipping or I will contact ebay for help. 
Note that 44 was item plus 7$ shipping, plus 25 border and post expense which I had to pay in my country because I bought from America, these 25 are my fault only, but its my first ebay experiance so I did not know. 

Finally, he sent me this proposal, which I and unsure about. What to do? 
What if I close refund, and he doesnt give money back? He never asked for my paypal acc. Am I protected by ebay if that happens? What should I do? 

Please help. :)

I'd understand his precaution if I had a new account but quite frankly I just don't like this. I know he's more than likely a very legitimate seller but still, I feel like it's an insult to my intelligence and integrity. 

I told him ""I can't leave feedback for an item I haven't received yet,"" and he says it's a safety measure. This goes both ways though. I'd just like to know if this is against terms of service/use or something like that?

Ebay,Got a warning for... reporting a scammer.,"**tl:dr;** ebay bots apparently caught the buyer's attempt to trade offside ebay but I was the one to get the blame.

Last week or so I woke up to a couple of private messages from someone saying they needed an invoice to complete the payment. My item was the last of a multiple units listing which I had no issues whatsoever. So, guy just basically asks for an invoice first and I reply why I can't (because nothing was bought/sold to him) and asked for more info on that problem. Just like this. And this was my only reply. He answered in a way that seemed rushed to me (like a chat over multiple pm) and with a shaddy story that he had called ebay and his bank 4 times each. Eventually I blocked him after his last message saying he finally paid but still needed my invoice and that meant my paypal address. The item ended today (unsold) and a couple of hours later I get this warning reffereing to that same listing. I only had that guy contacting me. At the time I even unwinded a bit here in the sub but someone wisely advised me just to ignore and not waste more of my time. I felt the same. And to sooth my mind, I contacted ebay CS via message, left all the details and blocked him. Never got a reply besides the automated one.

Today I got a warnign, basically saying to behave in the next three days and promising severe punishment in the next time. There was absolutely no attempt to trade offside of ebay, from my side. I chose my words very carefully while replying to him (was kinda guessing it), being informative and helpful without being extensively verbal not to trigger any red alarm on ebay bots. Apparently I failed. And all this leaves me feeling that someone can put competition off by just messaging him a couple of these offending messages. I've tried to get an explanation from CS, more that 1h waiting in line (no option to get a callback, I don't live in the US/UK and was paying an international phone call to get to nowhere).

Ebay,Noob question: Cancelling orders over 30 days?,"I recently got a job at a company that does a lot of sales online, ebay included. I was hired to help straighten out things for this company; they've had a lot of turnover and bad employees over the last 6 months. Because of how thinly they've been stretched, they've had issues keeping inventory straight online, so people will sometimes order things we don't actually carry anymore. This usually isn't a huge problem. We contact the buyer, and either get them a suitable replacement or order them what they wanted in the first place, or cancel the order. It isn't optimal, but we're working on it. 

There is a huge backlog of orders from buyers who never got back to us or were otherwise unreachable.

Ebay,I think a buyer wants to scam me by swapping an item.,"I recently sold some expensive yeezys on ebay and the buyer is saying that the item he received is not the correct size.

I'm guessing he wants to scam me and send back the incorrect size to me ( they might even be fake shoes ).

I have video evidence of me shipping the item at the post office.

I'm wondering what would be you guy's advice on how to tackle this? 

He just started messaging me an hour ago.

False alarm, either the guy was truly confused ( I don't know how ).

Ebay,What to do??,"A buyer bought some computer RAM that is rated to work up to 2000 Mhz, he can only get it to work up to 1866 Mhz because he has a crap motherboard. The RAM works fine - but he hasnt got the necessary equipment to squeeze the full speed capacity out. I have been very patient explaining how RAM works and what he could do to make the most of it, but he seems to lack basic infomation.

It was sold through the GSP program and now he wants a refund - which I am not happy to give as the product works perfectly - but he lacks the knowledge and kit to fully maximise use of it.

Ebay,Is it common for ebay sellers to underquote (lie about) postage?,"Today is the second time I've had an ebay seller underquote postage on an item from overseas (Australia to Europe) or (UK to Europe).

In both cases the true postage was over 50 dollars, and in initial contact with the seller, they quoted postage of around 20 dollars.

So they send me a bill for item price plus 20 dollars, which I paid, and the next day comes the email ""Sorry, but there was confusion at the post office. They tell me there was a mistake and the postage is 50 dollars, not 20. What do you want to do?""

Since this is the second time the exact same thing has happened, I am suspecting that ebay sellers routinely ""underquote"" the postage in order to get the sale, and then follow up to ask for the difference.

I'm much more likely to pay the extra 30 dollars after already paying 70, than paying 100 up front for an item worth 50.

Is this a common scam on the part of ebay sellers? It could of course be a true mistake but I'm very suspicious (second time now, exactly the same routine)",26,11.0,2017-11-29,EBAY,0.0550147220492363,0.9101718664169312,0.034813422709703445
Ebay,Not sure if I'm being scammed here...thoughts?,"About a week or so ago, I declined an offer from a user on eBay. Within a few hours, they sent me a weird, antagonistic message scolding me for rejecting their offer and accusing me of not being ""serious"" about selling my item because I didn't counteroffer and that they did not want to pay my asking price because there were a few (fully disclosed and photographed) imperfections that they would need to pay to have professionally fixed. 

I messaged them back (first mistake) explaining that their offer was too low for me and I sent them a new offer with my lowest price. They seemed (somewhat?) apologetic &amp; accepted and I shipped the item. 

Cut to a few days ago, I get another accusatory message claiming that the item is damaged (aside from aforementioned, extensively detailed imperfections that I explained in the listing) and that they wanted to let me know before ""filing a dispute &amp; leaving negative feedback"" I request photos, buyer sends them, and none of this damage was there when I shipped, but it's all damage that is easily fixed, which the buyer has told me they are planning to do. 

I don't want to jump to conclusions but considering their hostility to me upon my initial rejection of their lowball offer, and the fact that they've been making jabs at me about not taking my business seriously in virtually every message they've sent, it feels a little fishy. I told the buyer to open a return &amp; I'd send them a full refund, but their comment about getting the item repaired leads me to believe they have every intention of keeping the item &amp; possibly attempting to get a partial refund.
Basically my question is - am I obligated to give them one? What recourse do I have?

Ebay,Sold a bulky item. Buyer is stating not as listed and eBay siding with buyer. What next?,"I sold a very bulky Collector's Edition of a videogame and stated in the listing that ""all physical items are like new"". The buyer then asked me to clarify the status of the digital codes. I sent the following message: ""There are four sets of codes with the item. One is for the Legendary Edition digital items, one is for some maps in Halo Wars and there are two 48 hour Xbox LIVE Gold codes. The Legendary items and one of the 48 hour trial codes have been redeemed. The other one hasn't even been scratched off so definitely not used"".

The buyer then acknowledge the message and purchased the item through BIN.

When the item got there (sent tracked and signed) he stated (in some rather colourful language) it's not as described on the grounds that some of the codes were redeemed. I couldn't have been clearer. His sole message through eBay's resolution centre was. ""Item not as described"" and they have sided with him.

I'm not a regular seller, but I know eBay always sides with buyers (even those with 0 feedback, as in this case). I'll now make a significant loss on the item having to pay for shipping again.

Ebay,Help with “undelivered” expensive item that I shipped,"I’m the seller of a $1300 item. Insured it for $1300 with signature required. Shipped priority USPS on the 13th and it was out for delivery on the 15th.

From research I’ve done online, it most likely was delivered and just didn’t get a final scan. The buyer hasn’t complained which is another big indicator that it was delivered.

Ebay,Is this a scam? How should I go about resolving this ebay issue,"Hi everyone,

So I just won a bid from someone who has a 605 star rating and 100% positive feedback in the last year.

They didn't allow purchasing by credit card so I payed with my paypal account.

It says unpaid and the link instead of saying 'pay now' says 'view paypal transaction'.  When I go there it says it is pending for the seller to accept payment.

When I emailed the seller they said that they haven't received any notification in their paypal account.  The email that they said they have for paypal is different than the one linked through ebay.

Now, I know this has scam written all over it, but they have so many positive reviews (most as buyers but some as sellers) and the item is like a $20 item.  It seems weird to me to try and scam for something so small.

Ebay,Update: My Experience With the Guaranteed Delivery Program,"[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/7ewc7e/my_experience_with_the_guaranteed_delivery_program/)

I received an email reply from the GDP Representative who advised me the inclusion of the feedback option is an intended feature of the Guaranteed Delivery program. If negative feedback results from a late delivery but the seller is not at fault, the seller would then contact eBay Customer Support to have the feedback removed.

The reply didn't really address the specific circumstances of my case; the loophole where buyers would previously be blocked from leaving retaliatory feedback would not be closed.  If you are enrolled in the GDP and ship within the promised handling time, you are not necessarily protected previous to the inception of the GDP if the delivery scan is late. It seems if you have to deal with an INR case where you have fulfilled your promises, you have to be vigilant with your feedback when the buyer does not get the outcome(refund) they were expecting.

It's disappointing because every year we can count on the holiday period to provide shipping delays.",6,5.0,2017-11-30,EBAY,0.3496549129486084,0.6277439594268799,0.022601082921028137
Ebay,GPD - We're not participating. What's your opinion?,"We meet the criteria for the GDP, but have chosen to not opt-in.  As many people have stated on this forum and others, the only benefit to sellers appears to be showing up in searches when the GPD filter is used.

I have always felt that buyers would use the benefits of the GDP to push for escalated claims, even against sellers who are not participating.  Just this week, we had a buyer open a return when tracking showed that the item was in transit, but hadn't been delivered yet.   We asked that they wait one more day (past the delivery date) as the USPS stated the package was out for delivery.  Instead the buyer called eBay to escalate.  In the meantime, the USPS updated the package as delivered, and eBay closed the case in our favor.

On the downside, our eBay sales have continued to drop as we have chosen to opt-out of eBay seller ""benefits"" like the GDP, and promoted listings.  On the upside, sales on our other channels have more than compensated for this.  

We'll keep listing on eBay as long as it's feasible for us, but until eBay makes concerted efforts to develop programs that actually benefit sellers, we'll focus our growth potential elsewhere.

Ebay,I want to return an item I bought second hand on Ebay that arrived to me broken.,"I bought a pair of second hand CDJ 850's from a guy on Ebay who lives in Manchester for 800 GBP. As I live in the Balearic Islands in Spain, I had him ship the package using DHL to a friend who works for DHL and lives in London and then had that friend ship the package to me from there.

When I received the package here on the 23rd of November and plugged the CDJs in to see how they were, one of them had an issue with the sound output. I first sent the seller a message informing him about the issue and he assured me that he played them before he sold them and couldn't hear any issues with them. I then went to a shop here that sells and repairs DJ equipment and they took the CDJ to evaluate what was wrong with it. After a few days they got back to me and told me that the repair was to do with a worn audio output (female phono) at the back of the CDJ. They priced the repair at €179,37. After I received the price, I asked the seller if he could foot the bill as the item arrived damaged when it was listed as fully working. He then refused and I asked then if he would be willing to pay for half of the cost to fix them and he refused again. 

Now I want to return them and get a refund for the CDJs instead of fixing them. But my question is: am I eligible for a refund?
