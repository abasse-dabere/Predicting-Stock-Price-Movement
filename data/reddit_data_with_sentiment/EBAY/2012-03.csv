Ebay,Small Question Concerning Buyer's Idiocy,"So, I sold a PS2 game that was actually an import from the UK - therefore, it only plays on UK/PAL PS2s.

Despite all of this, the person who bought the game managed not to take in any of this information and now wants to return it because it's not a US version of the game.

Ebay,Avoiding scammers,"Hello r/Ebay!

I have a question for this community. I have a high dollar item (~1500-1600 Triathlon Bicycle) that I want to sell through Ebay. How can I avoid scammers? I currently have this listed under a Buy It Now or Best Offer, and have received offers from one individual with a randomized name (ie: jimbobob193932) with zero feedback as well as a customer with private feedback (I just learned today you could even have private feedback, what the fuck?) who is listed as being from Thailand, though the shipping address is in California.

What really scares me is that one of these obvious scammers would choose the buy it now option instead of submitting an offer. Then, I would have to ship an item to somebody who I think will attempt rip me off. What can I do to protect myself against this?

I have put within the listing itself, please do not buy this out or put in an offer if you have zero or private feedback, as I will not ship this item to you and will take the negative feedback hit. I assume this is against Ebay's TOS and could possibly become an issue with Ebay, but I'm not going to get scammed and lose the item.

Thanks so much in advance for any feedback. All posts will get upvoted.

Ebay,Buyer wants a return on an item with No Returns.,"Title states it all.  It is a NWT Wetsuit, with no refunds.  It was bought last week/sent out the next day.  The buyer just sent me an email stating the suit is not big enough for him.  (Wow! 3XL!)

I have dealt with this before, and have gladfully accepted refunds.  But this is a high dollar item and it is the buyer's negligence.

My question--- Can I tell the buyer to read the ad again that stated no refunds?  (I know if he sends it back, I MUST refund him)

Should I ignore the buyer?  

Should I hit him back with a partial refund? 

 Will Ebay have my back if I decide not to award a refund??

Ebay,First Class Mail,"Hi everyone sorry if this question has been asked before I couldn't find it so thought I'd give it a try again.

I been mailing out stuff i sold on ebay with those 4x8 bubble mailers. I have been told by usps clerks that those can only go as first class parcel anytime bubble mailers are involved which is $1.64. However, just the other day, I received the same mailer, but with a 65cent stamp on it. Is there a rule somewhere that helps u decide when to slap a stamp or print out a postage thru ebay? Also, why 65cents and not 80cents or 75cents? Where does this 65 come from? It'll be great if I can mail it out with just a stamp on it!

Ebay,"Not really sure if this post should go here, but this community is active enough and Ebay is an auction-type website. Take a look please:","Hi, I'm doing a sociology project on the A&amp;E show, Storage Wars. You know the one where they go to various storage units and auction off the compartment to various bidders. Right, I'm doing a little examination on the show through the commodity fetish theory and was wondering if maybe an auctioning type community could help me out.

I'm looking to know how (as auctioneer-ish people) you feel about Storage Wars. Is it a realistic example of what people can expect when they bid on storage compartments? Is it realistic of the auction process? Do you feel like this show fuels a commodity fetish within viewers? 

* Side note from my book: *the fetishism of commodities is the process by which commodities and the market for them are granted independent objective existence by the actors in a capitalist society. People tend to loose sight that THEY produce these commodities and give them value*

Ebay,How overlooking a tiny detail can almost screw you. (long),"Yeah... it's long. tl;dr at bottom.

Hello fellow ebayers! I just had an experience I wanted to share as a pre-caution in case it might happen to you. It's actually silly as it's so small a detail one shouldn't overlook, but I was the worst-case scenario. And you don't want to be. 

I lost the password to my first email (hotmail) over 7 years ago. Haven't used it. Hence, it has too long since been removed from my paypal, as well as my ebay account. It was linked to another old email (yahoo) that I used at school. After school, I closed that account completely without really thinking about it. 

Had a new email, and have been using it fine for years, and again, it's the only one listed under my ebay and paypal. I've bought plenty of things with it over the years. 

I decided to sell two things recently, and have before with 100% feedback, 0 problems. I made the posts, using an old template, the items sold on the weekend, and I sat awaiting payment thinking they were slow since three days went by. I didn't see anything pending on my paypal, yet I check my email that morning and both sellers have contacted me politely asking why the payment is pending, that they had paid three days before. 

I'm utterly confused.

I'm refreshing ebay, paypal, email, you name it. I even called paypal, but with crappy Sprint service, I couldn't hold a call &gt;.&lt; I then started checking the links to accounts, making sure they are valid when I receive the call from ebay stating there is a problem and my email is unconfirmed with them! I am thinking what the hell I've been hacked?! 

And he asks me to re-confirm my xxxxxxxxx@hotmail address to accept the payment. Here, I'm confused even more as to how this disassociated account ended up in the mix when it hits me. I check the template, and sure enough there was the old as hell email address I didn't have access to. 

All anger melted as I realize how retarded I am, then I'm like well damn could've happened to anybody, then I'm like AHHHHHHHH! I figured it out thank science, at least I had that much. 

So I try to add the old email to my paypal, and of course, I need to confirm it, and I already know I don't know the password. PW reset, forgotten first pet names later, account locked. Anger city. Manage to unlock it but can't change the password because it want's to know the old password. Great system Hotmail! This goes on for like ten minutes, I submit the forms for my email lost/recovery option and wait... 


Then it hits me.

I checked and amazingly enough I was able to re-create the terminated yahoo account, and under hotmail bypass the password reset by sending the reset link directly to the freshly created, but previously for years terminated yahoo account, finally enabling me to reset the password on the hotmail account, verify it with paypal, accept the payment, and send these poor people their items. 

Now. If you read all that, thank you. Because I lived it for you. Don't be a dumbass and expect ebay to automatically update your old ass template with your new email address if you stupidly lose the password to your old email address, and close out the associated account with it. You'll thank me later!

tl;dr - I am a dumbass who left his old email address I had 7 years previously lost access to in a template I used to sell something on ebay, and went through hell trying to receive mis-sent payment, but more importantly get two people their items.",1,4,2012-03-15,EBAY,0.07627063244581223,0.8971626162528992,0.026566684246063232

Ebay,Having some trouble with a buyer - advice?,"Dear r/ebay,
I need advice.
I recently sold a cheapo tablet on eBay and shipped it domestically (Australia).
Then I started getting emails from the buyer saying she'd given me the wrong mailing address - OOPS! - she hadn't changed it when she moved.

So I thought - not my problem! You clearly are in the wrong here. You even admitted to it!

And then, she starts emailing me loads saying I need to talk to Australia Post to sort it all out for her - meanwhile, this item cost me $15 to ship (she paid $9 postage fee which i was fine with), and did not come with a tracking number. She starts asking me for a tracking number - do not have one! My listing did not say there would be tracking number, nor did she request one upon purchase and payment.

So then she emails me saying she's contacted the new tenants and they forwarded on a pick-up slip to her - so it seems the package arrived at the local post office. She goes to pick it up and they don't have it anymore. So now I had to call AusPost - I did it - and set up an investigation to find this bloody thing. I gave her all the details and referenc number and had permission put on the ticket so she could add information and make enquiries.

She's now asking that if it doesn't turn up, can she have a refund?

How about no? this whole mess is in no way my fault - if anything, it's her own fault for giving me the wrong address. I will not be refunding if I don't receive the item back.

I contacted eBay and they said ""there is a very limited set of situations in which we will allow sellers to dispute feedback"" - essentially a brush-off. I do not have a huge ebay score (100% feedback, but less than a 100 transactions total) and negative feedback would look terrible for me.

Is there anything else I can do, or will I just have to put up with it? There is ZERO chance of a refund unless I get the item back - that's the one thing I will not compromise on.

Please help! and thanks for any suggestions anyone has :)",24,2,2012-03-15,EBAY,0.08287142962217331,0.8853659629821777,0.03176257014274597

Ebay,Seller taking too long to ship items,"So i'm newer to ebay and i'm not sure what i can do. First off just to make this clear, the lady i bought this item from has a 100% positive rating, around 60 comments saying how fast the shipping was and how quickly they got the item, and how great the transactions were. I won an auction for a tablet on Monday at 12pm. I paid literally the minute after i won because i wanted to get the tablet asap (i've been shopping for months and can't stand to wait any longer)i'm thinking ok, you know when your auction ends, you should be ready to ship the item as soon as the bid is over, at least a few of my friends who use ebay religiously tell me 9 times out of 10 the seller they usually encounter ships same day.

After this email i'm a little upset, i realize its only a day later but at the same time you KNEW when your auction would end, you should have planned to have this thing shipped out. So Wednesday rolls around and i get nothing, so i email her asking whats up, i get a ""ill get off of work early TOMORROW (Thursday) and ship it, and send you a tracking number right away.

Hoping maybe a possibility of negative feedback gets her into gear. Its almost 10pm here and no response or tracking number. I'm pretty upset and i want to know what i can do?

Ebay,Anything else I can do here?,"About a week ago, I listed the following auction:

http://www.ebay.com/itm/110841045828#ht_500wt_998

(the imgur link in the auction is still valid)

The person who used Buy It Now paid and I sent the items off. Last Monday, he got them, and left me neutral feedback complaining about one card being damaged. Does my auction description not detail this fact? I sold these items at a reduced rate (about $15) to compensate for this damage, as well.

When I shipped the item, I found out that it would cost me $20 because of his remote location in California, but paid it anyway because I said free shipping, so I figured I'd keep my word. During the package's transit time, the buyer did not respond to any of my several attempts to communicate with him. After saving $15 off the bat, the shipping out of my pocket, and PayPal fees, the buyer saved $40, enough to buy another copy of this particular card. I did all this out of being nice, and was shocked as all hell to find out he'd screwed me on the back end.

He did revise the feedback when I sent a revision request, but decided to keep it neutral, and STILL complained about the damage to one of the cards that I specifically detailed in the auction anyway, as if he had no clue the card was going to be in the condition it was in.

Also, my funds in PayPal have STILL not cleared. Anyone know how long I can expect to wait for PayPal to let me have my money, or if I will have a payment nightmare on my hands because the buyer left me neutral feedback? Anyone know if there's anything I can do about this, at this point?

The buyer has requested for me to cancel the transaction without giving him a non paying strike.  What is the process here?  Should I grant it to him?  If I don't can he leave me negative feedback?

Please don't complete the transaction and don't ship the item. You may have received an email saying the buyer has paid. However, that's probably a fake message.

This would have been really helpful a MONTH ago, when the item was purchased and shipped. Rather than now when they've already completed the investigation and returned the funds.

I have set up flair for Power Sellers (PS) [](/PS) and Top Rated Sellers (TRS) [](/TRS)as well. If you would like to have either one assigned to you, [send me a PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Lancaster1983&amp;subject=/r/eBay%20Flair) with your eBay ID and which you prefer. I would like to keep these two pieces of flair dedicated to those who are actual TRS or PS.


Users who have a [](/badge) or a [](/PP) next to their name are verified employees of eBay or PayPal. eBay has internal policies relating to blogging and social networking. We expect these users to conform to that policy and therefore may not be able to speak on certain subjects that go into confidential or proprietary information. *The opinions of these verified users are not that of eBay.*

**Note: If you ask for TRS or PS flair and you later go and change it on the sidebar to a feedback star, it will erase your TRS or PS flair and will need to be reassigned by a mod.**

Thank you!

*Edit 11/30: I have added the ability to to have both PS and TRS at once like this [](/Both).",25,8,2012-03-27,EBAY,0.02486872486770153,0.9389275908470154,0.03620369732379913
Ebay,How long does it generally take sellers to ship their merchandise?,"I've recently started using eBay again, I haven't used it since sixth grade.  Well, I dropped about 300 bones on some clothing and a pair of Bapestas, and some of my purchases have been paid for for several days already. 

Just wondering about the protocol for messaging sellers back to get they asses in gear.  I don't want to seem pushy or impatient, but I'm really itching to start rocking my products.",3,2,2012-03-27,EBAY,0.037116777151823044,0.8976090550422668,0.065274178981781

Ebay,Buyer claims not to have gotten an item i shipped.,"So i shipped an item to an eBay user about 10 days ago, but they`re claiming they didn't receive it but im nearly 100% sure they did. I shipped two other items the same way using the same shipping method and they got to there location in 3-5 days.

Ebay,Received item but was refunded. Advice?,"About a week and a half ago, I won an eBay auction and paid instantly (I always do). The next day I get an email from eBay saying the listing was removed and the seller was under investigation. No sweat, this has happened before. I was just going to wait until the day the item was to be delivered, then file a claim if needed. My item arrived so I thought things were all good. Well, I got an email from eBay today saying my paypal was refunded for the full amount.
Bear in mind I never filed a claim against this seller. To make things more confusing, I check the box my item came in and it had a packing slip from walmart addressed to me but ""purchased"" by a person other than the person who's name was on the paypal account that I sent payment to. So, did this seller steal a credit card, make bogus eBay auctions, and purchase items on a stolen credit card? What is reddit's view? What do you think I should do about this?",8,2,2012-03-29,EBAY,0.09540680795907974,0.8797199130058289,0.024873213842511177
Ebay,What should I do?,I bought something about a month ago. It arrives defective. I open a PayPal case and the seller never responds. I escalate the case to a claim. The seller still does not respond and the deadline to respond passes. PayPal gives me a full refund and tells me that I do not have to return the item because the seller never replied and Paypal is the one providing the refund. I confirm this with a phone call. I throw the item on ebay for cheap since it is defective. Now today the original seller contacts me saying that he saw that PayPal gave me a refund and when should he expect to have the item back. I know this is more Paypal related than eBay related but the PayPal subreddit only has 10 readers.,0,1,2012-03-29,EBAY,0.05216903239488602,0.9128534197807312,0.03497753664851189

Ebay,I'm an Ebay Newbie and was BANNED. Where Do I Go From Here?,"Hello, like the title says, I was banned. My eBay account and Paypal account are both verified and it was my real, legit eBay account (actually my only eBay account). I tried to sell my first item last night (a video game book that normally sells for about $70 - $100) but was banned - MC999. I called eBay this morning and they told me that the account is not eligible for reinstatement and that they cannot tell me the exact reason I was banned. I just ""posed a significant risk to the community"". WTF??

So now, where do I go from here? I don't want this misstep to stop me from making money on eBay, so can anyone offer help or advice for this newbie? Thanks!",6,3,2012-03-30,EBAY,0.06099262088537216,0.9074391722679138,0.031568195670843124
Ebay,Sellers undercutting sellers.,"So how do you all deal with other sellers undercutting you by meager amounts. The products I sell range from like $200 to $900 each. Of course there are other sellers on there selling the same thing. They will come along and undercut me for $0.50. Not a problem really because I just do the same thing back. 

My question is what is the most efficient way to track all that so I know when someone has undercut me. I have saved searches email me when there are new products but that seems to be quite time consuming when you have 50 different products. Do you all track this type of thing. What is the most efficient way to do it?",3,2,2012-03-30,EBAY,0.021511541679501534,0.9258831739425659,0.052605289965867996
Ebay,Is it worth it to get into selling right now?,"I buy and sell regularly on Ebay.  Only things I just happen to have or no longer need.  I've never gone out of my way to acquire something just to sell.

I've recently come across an item, however, that is worth more in parts than it is whole.  Through my research it looks like I can purchase the item new, disassemble it, and sell off the parts on Ebay.  I should gross about $200 in profit, half of which, it seems, is going to go to Ebay and Paypal fees.  So a net of roughly $100.  I have considered my time invested and I'm thinking this may end up being a worth while bump in my income if repeated often enough.

There are a lot of these items for sale on Ebay however the majority of them do sell.  Very few pieces go unsold.  The competition is definitely there, but the prices that are being charged still allow a small profit margin.

I've considered my time, packaging and shipping costs, Ebay and Paypal fees.  Am I forgetting anything?

With the current condition of Ebay, the fees, etc. does it seem like a good time to enter the market?",5,3,2012-03-31,EBAY,0.026996081694960594,0.9145808815956116,0.05842302739620209
Ebay,Shipping damage questions,"1. If an item arrives damaged and had insurance, is it buyer or seller's responsibility to file the damage claim? If it's the seller's responsibility, what is the process? Does ebay immediately refund the buyer, or does the buyer have to ship the item back before they get their refund? 

2. If a buyer insists on cheap shipping without insurance and the item arrives damaged, is the seller free of responsibility?

edit: i've partially answered number 1. At least in Canada, the sender has to file the claim. Still wondering how the ebay refund process works for damaged items. Does the seller do it or does ebay/paypal automatically yank money from your account to refund the buyer?",12,2,2012-03-31,EBAY,0.10857810080051422,0.8630680441856384,0.02835388295352459
