Ebay,Toxic buyer bought an item of mine.,"I just had a buyer buy an item of mine and as usually, I check their feedback profile. In feedback given, I saw some serious concerns.

I watch my feedback very closely and have always kept it at 100% and now this beast comes.
How can I protect my feedback against her?


Loads of feedback like:
1. Never received shirt. Seller never responded, never sent
- follow up comment from seller was ""psycho buyer, tried to extort item and moeny. Beware of scams.""
2. ""bad communication ship very slow""
follow-up by seller: ""Shipping label printed sae day as payment. Mailman picked up the following morning""
3. ""Never received. Seller Never responded. Ebay had to pay me back thief""
follow up by seller: ""Tracking shows it was received! Never dealt with such a horrible customer.""
4. ""Wasted $$$""
5. ""Not worth the $
6. ""SHIPIING SUCKED!! Was very slow I'm in MS. Cute dress""
- Follow-up by seller: ""Payment received on 8th (Wed), item delivered to buyer on 13 (Mon).""

She was also pretty rude in messages. ""I'm paying. I won an item. Thanks for shipping today""",18,7,2016-08-01,EBAY,0.10685624927282333,0.8637230396270752,0.02942068874835968
Ebay,Advice on getting a refund,"I bought a working phone off a guy on ebay with 99% feedback and it arrived with a broken charging port.

Ebay,Buyer won't return item...insists on partial refund. Not sure what to do?!,"[Sorry for long post...I'm a little frustrated] I recently sold a $70 new without tags sweater from my personal closet (I don't usually do that, I sell other peoples clothing).

At first she wanted to wash the sweater in hot water to try and get rid of the smell/residue, and if the sweater was damaged, she wanted me to refund her. I said NO! That will definitely ruin the sweater. It's meant to be hand washed in cold water only because of the type of material it is made out of.

Then I told her again, please open a case with eBay and return the sweater. She replies, ""But I really like it. I just want a partial refund because you said it was new and it isn't"". At this point, I think she's just trying to get some of her money back. I know there's nothing wrong with the sweater. Do I just ignore her and let her open an INAD through eBay?

Ebay,"Need Advice: Buyer Wants to Return Item, Claims She Bought Incomplete Item Even Though It's Complete","Hi there! I need advice please. Recently, a person bought a set of collectible items from me. Originally, the collectibles included an action figure and a video game. Since the action figure and games were long gone, I only sold the rest of the collectible items.

Here's how I created the listing.

The title clearly indicates something along the lines of ""Game Name, Game Hero's Collectible Items"".

In the pictures, I clearly took pictures of EACH collectible item in the set that I was selling. Only items for sale were in the pictures.

In the description, I clearly listed EACH collectible item that I showed in the picture. Since they were still sealed in their wrapper, I also indicated that they're sealed and unused.

Not once did I mention that the action figure or game were included, because they weren't. I clearly listed in the title, description as well as showed in the pictures exactly what was being sold. There is nowhere that could even make you think that the action figure and game were included because I made sure to list and show exactly what was included in the set I was selling.

Now the buyer (who has 0 Ebay reputation points and signed up back in 2014) claims that she felt ""scammed"" because the action figure and game weren't included in the collectibles set that I sold. 

Also, she mentions that a little tray inside the container has a slight  damage and the metallic collectible container has a dent. Those were things that weren't there when I sold the item to her. 

Now thinking back about it, I didn't get to take a picture of the cardboard tray inside because I never thought much about it, it's just a tray. As for the metallic container, the last time I looked at it when I was wrapping it in bubblewrap, there was no dent or damage to it. I only took a picture of the metallic container to show it in my item's listing, but unfortunately I wasn't able to take a picture of the back part. 

How should I deal with this case? Do I have a chance to refuse this refund/return request? I also indicated ""No Returns"" on the listing (which I already know isn't really something that works on Ebay). 

I just think that I should fight this because I didn't do anything wrong and I did my duty to make it clear on my listing what were the items that were included in the set, in the title, the pictures, and the description.

This is causing me such a headache. 

Please give me some advice on what to do, thanks!",4,4,2016-08-03,EBAY,0.07040373980998993,0.899527370929718,0.030068913474678993

Ebay,"Problems with ""best offer"" and calculated shipping.","Anyone else notice that when you accept a best offer, the system presents an inflated FedEx shipping &amp; handling amount to the buyer at checkout?  Sometimes it's off by cents, other times $2-3 or more.

I've had to send invoices to correct this.  A waste of my time, and doesn't make me look good.  I offer 2-4 different shipping options on any given listing.  It seems to get the USPS rate correct, but randomly inflates the FedEx or UPS services.

The workaround is to quickly go back to my listing, enter the buyer ZIP code to see what it told the buyer, and send out an invoice before the buyer gets to the checkout with the screwed up amounts.

This has been going on for more than a year, so eBay is not fixing whatever the problem is.  (Note that I do not present ""discounted rates"" to the buyers on any listings.  Open to any other possible causes).

Ebay,"I'm an eBay seller that does not offer returns. A buyer wants to return a dress that didn't fit. Should I accept her return? If so, can I assess a restocking fee?","I sell popular brand clothes and do not offer returns. In the description of every listing, I specifically encourage buyers to contact me with any questions they have before purchasing, since everything is final sale.

A buyer recently contacted me to let me know a dress she bought from me was way too tight on her, and that I should have written ""runs small"" in my listing. I *had* read customer reviews before listing it, and while some said that the dress ran a bit small, most said it fit true to size. So I didn't mention it either way in my listing - nor did I list any measurements other than size and length (I typically don't).

Anyway, now this buyer wants a return, despite my ""no returns"" policy and the specific note I left in the description about contacting me with questions prior to purchase. I'm all about providing excellent customer service and I'd honestly feel pretty terrible if I didn't accept her return, since it would mean that she'd be stuck with a very fancy dress that she can't wear. But I also feel that because she didn't contact me to check measurements before purchasing, I could at least justify assessing a restocking fee.

What would you do in this circumstance? Would it be a jerk move to tell her that I charge a restocking fee even though it's not mentioned anywhere on my account (there aren't too many ways you can add to a ""no returns"" policy). Or should I just allow her to return for a full refund if she agrees to pay for shipping? Can I stipulate that she has to buy insurance? Otherwise, if the dress arrives in anything less than the condition in which I sent it, what should I do about a refund?

Ebay,"Sold Something to Be Drop Shipped, Buyer Wants a Refund","Buyer placed the order, and I ordered the item to be shipped to her right away. About 8 hours later, she asks for a refund because she needs the money for rent.

The site I bought it from says they do not cancel orders. I emailed them and asked if they can cancel, or if I could at least have the shipping address changed.

I can't just refund her since the product is already going to her. I was thinking of having her send me an invoice for $50 that I can pay. That way, on her purchase I can provide tracking as protection while on my ""purchase"" I can later file a claim if I need to.

Only small issue, I recounted six (6) times and there were only 49 in the roll, not 50.
It is only one short, very minimal value (maybe $1.50ish). Seller has 100% feedback. I assume it was a complete accident...counting out 50, and lose count for a moment...

Do I say anything such as 'the roll was short one, you might want to double check these in the future'. Or, would that come off as obnoxious? 
I'm not asking for any partial refund, nor another dime mailed to me (hardly worth the time and postage). Also, giving Positive feedback as I do completely believe it was just an oversight. 

UPDATE EDIT: I left positive feedback. Left message that the roll was short one, just to be careful with other buyers. I didn't ask for partial refund, nor mail out another silver dime.

Hello xxxxxx,


Thank you for writing in to us through Facebook about your account suspension.


After taking a deeper look into your account, it appears that your account was suspended for being linked to a PayPal account that is reported to us as restricted.


You should still be able to appeal the suspension once that PayPal account is resolved. It looks like it might be an old on, registered to a Road Runner email address. After you have taken care of that PayPal account please reply back and we’ll see what can be done from there.


Thanks!

Ebay,"Can you win INAD case if ""vintage"" item is not vintage?","Against my better judgement, I bought a ""vintage"" item of clothing off of ebay last week. 

Item titled as ""Vintage t-shirt"" and the seller note on the item was ""In good used vintage condition"". The shirt is in a style and colour palette from the early 90s; the seller makes no claim of the decade in the listing.

I paid a slightly premium price for the shirt but was happy to get something ~25 years old with such crisp colours.

I get the shirt and there's a bloody QR code on the tag - which obviously didn't exist in the 90s. Doing a bit of research with the codes, the shirt was sold in 2007. The tag was not shown in the photos, obviously.

Message the seller saying I'm not pleased the expensive ""vintage"" tshirt I bought is less than 10 years old. He writes back:

""Vintage means anything from the past weather that was yesterday, last week or 10 years ago! 

It was only a title on eBay, I wouldn't look so in to it!""

I open an INAD case with photos of the QR tag and paste in the seller's comments that vintage could mean something from yesterday or last week and that his listing was deceptive. Instead of responding in the case, he sends me another message telling me that I'm dumb and his listing said no returns so I will have to ""bite the bullet"".

How does ebay usually side in cases like these? It doesn't look like he's going to respond to the case, so I will have to wait for it to expire and then let ebay decide.

Ebay,"34"" Monitor Shipping Nightmare, $85 Postage Due, Refusal","Hey Reddit,

I've been living in a domestic shipping nightmare for the last week.

I bought an item from a seller on ebay; all positive reviews, low price, free shipping, checks out.
Come the delivery day, I'm being told the seller used a flat rate label, and I owe the difference in postage, which is $85.

I refused the package. I was told they'd hold it for 4 days until returning to the sender.

Meanwhile, communicating with the sender is terrible. Language barrier didn't help. I couldn't convey to him that he owed me the $85 postage in time, and they began the return of the package.

A week later, he says he'll pay the postage, but the language barrier has me confused on if he *has* paid it, or *will* pay it.

The tracking number updates and says I refused the package. I ask the seller once again for the $85 postage, he finally complies, and we're on our way.

I visit the USPS today on lunch and lo and behold: the package is already being returned to the sender. No 4 day hold this time around.

USPS says they offer a ""package intercept"" service, doesn't work.

Any advice at all with this nightmare would help. I'm grasping at straws here. Don't let me down Reddit.",8,6,2016-08-09,EBAY,0.028569359332323074,0.9183470606803894,0.053083617240190506

Ebay,Seller sent me wrong item. Won't respond to messages. But I am fine keeping what was sent.,"Hello r/ebay, I am hoping I can get some advice here. I want to start all this by saying I want to do the right thing and I have taken steps to get into contact with the seller so we can straighten this all out.

OK so here is what happened. I ordered a Pokemon Fates collide elite trainer box for $60 from a large seller of trading cards. It was shipped out right away and I received my package from them in a week. But when I saw it I knew it was not what I ordered. I opened it up and sure enough it was a Pokémon Fates collide Booster Box valued at $124. The wrong item but one significantly better than what I ordered. At First I was thrilled but I knew I would feel bad opening it as I did not order it. So I sent them a email right away to let them know a mistake had occurred. I am willing to send it back or offer to pay the difference since it's already here. 

 But it has been three business days since I sent them a email and I have not heard back from them. I am growing impatient and want to either get what I ordered or just open what they sent me.

So here is my question to you fine people. I have made a real effort to get THIER mistake corrected. How long should I wait to hear back from them? I want to do the right thing here but I also want what they sent me. I have done some searching and here in Ontario we have the Consumer Protection Act, of 2002. Basically what it says for Unsolicited good in the mail is that I don't have to pay for it or send it back. So am I ok l if they don't respond and I keep it on the Ebay side of things? 

I feel like I will get mixed responses here but like I said I have taken steps to correct the issue and I have not opened the wrong product yet. Thanks for your time, cheers.

He said that he orders car parts all the time and they always allow items to ship such as bumpers and other seats in the past. 

Two questions: Who is correct here: the pack and ship place or the buyer?

Also, will it be a small fortune to pay for shipping since it is going to a military base on the other side of the world or am I pretty much just paying what it would cost to ship to the military shipping center in New York?

Are there any rules against this, and if not, what's the easiest way to go about it? 

What I was thinking was to write down the titles of all the tapes, check for value above the average, and have a flat price for one list of average cost tapes, and then another flat price for the second list which is above average value tapes. So, I would have two listings, with multiple availability.

Then, when someone purchases the box, I could strike out those titles in the listing.

As a couple of commenters requested an update on the situation, here it is:

The seller did not respond to the INAD case. Today I requested eBay's assistance in resolving the matter. 15 minutes later I received an email saying that as the seller had not responded, the case was being closed in my favour, and they refunded me for the full purchase price + shipping.

I would have been happy to return the item to the seller, and indeed tried to work things out with him before opening an INAD case. Since he called me ""dumb"" for requesting a refund when he doesn't accept refunds and told me I would have to ""bite the bullet"" as his definition of vintage means ""anything from the past - yesterday or last week"", I don't feel bad at all.

There were some interesting comments in my original post regarding sellers playing fast and loose with their definition of ""vintage"". Etsy requires items be 20 years old to meet that definition; eBay unfortunately has no such regulations in place to prevent the term from being used misleadingly.

This morning, I checked the seller's feedback and now, there were five pieces of negative feedback from people who bought the same item as I did from the seller. Those pieces of negative feedback say that the item never shipped, and that the seller won't answer questions about this, and that they were scammed. This afternoon, I checked my purchase history and now, in place of the item I bought, eBay shows this: http://i.imgur.com/8ocGdQE.png

Then, I checked the seller's feedback again, and all the negative feedback is gone!

So...what do I do (besides getting a refund if the item still isn't shipped by August 17th? Should I wait until August 17th before purchasing the same item from another seller, just in case this item gets delivered anyway? Why did the seller's negative feedback disappear?",4,6,2016-08-12,EBAY,0.2522970139980316,0.7220777273178101,0.025625279173254967
Ebay,Big Stuff Up With Unpaid Case/Sold Item,"So, recently I posted about how I accidentally marked my product as ""Payment Received"" so that I could close the case and then cancel the item. However, this certainly didn't go as planned. I cant cancel the item and to make matters worse Ebay is wanting to invoice me $30 to manually cancel this.

So, my question is, instead of having to pay, would it be possible to have the buyer mark the item they bought from me as ""received"" and ""paid for"" without actually exchanging any money or items? If I can ask him to do so and he agrees, would this cancel the order and end the troubles?",9,5,2016-08-12,EBAY,0.5075662136077881,0.4708666205406189,0.02156710997223854

Ebay,"Got bad feeling about potential buyer so I blocked them, they still keep contacting me","I have a few clothing items for sale. Right now I'm just trying to clear out things I don't personally use anymore.  The size of each is stated in my listings.  I got a message about one of them that was a wall of questions.

Ebay,"Selling smaller items, Tradable Cards, DVDs, Video Games, need suggestions on shipping / scales?","So I went to the local USPS to get an idea of what the costs to ship items such as single TCG cards, smaller boxes of cards, DVDs (single or multiple), and smaller collectables from video games. Well the rough answer she gave me was to get a postal scale as she often daily reject solo sellers trying to skip the weight guidelines.

I personally use to sell TCG singles through another site using only a hard plastic sleeve, a regular envelope and some stamps.  Occasionally using small bubble wrap sleeves for small amounts of different singles in hard plastic.

She described that things which can't bend would need to be sent by something called media mail?

To be fair, the single TCG cards in envelopes could barely bend due to the plastic. Yet I got away with shipping with just normal postage?

Well, for my own sake I would definitely like to get a scale, but don't want to blow the wallet out. I plan to do some house cleaning, and as a gaming nerd of all varieties have tons of small collectables, including varying amounts of different TCGs to perge. I guess my main issue is I don't know what the lowest weight I should look for is? Even better if I could get links to models with reviews on amazon as this won't be a long lasting type of gig but selling stuff for a few months at best before lotting all unsold items.

My second question would be... What do: Shipping? I believe from thumbing around the ebay sell listing page, you enter a weight and dimensions and ebay can generate a shipping label for you? Any item I've sold on ebay thus far has been digital, shippings completely new to me. But I fear selling DVD singles may not be worth the time depending on the DVD. If it sales for 10$, and the shipping is like 6-8$... I'd rather try and sell locally at that rate.

What advice can you guys give to guide me in this endeavor?",23,6,2016-08-13,EBAY,0.03823480010032654,0.9281145334243774,0.03365074098110199

Ebay,As a seller: Should I include the original receipt for purchase (jewelry)?,"I'm clearing out my mother's estate, which consists of thousands of pieces of jewelry from HSN and QVC (fun times!).

I have had decent success so far, but recently found a bunch of boxes filled with her obsessive documentation of every. single. piece. of jewelry she ever purchased, including it's MSRP along with how much she ""saved"" when she got it ""on sale"" (this is television shopping mind you). This information includes all of the invoices and original receipts.

After spending quite a bit of time researching sold listings of similar products, I'm realizing she actually DID get some good deals, compared to what people are willing to pay.

For example, there is a ring that she only paid $37 USD for, and the receipt shows this (it also shows the jewelry, signed by the designer, is more legitimate and adds that layer of legitimacy to my listings). However, I'm finding buyers in the past are paying upwards of $120 for this same ring.

If I list this ring, and it sells for say, $90, would it possibly piss off a buyer to know an insane profit was made from this technical ""flip"" of the item, when I send them the proof of purchase/invoice/receipt showing my mother paid only $37 for it in 2008?

I could just snip the price paid out with scissors, but that seems borderline unprofessional/tacky/weird. Or, am I overthinking it?

Ebay,Just bought an item from a listing that seems really sketchy to me,"Hi. I have used Ebay for a while, mostly for buying cheap electronics and some camera accessoires/lenses from China/Hong Kong. Havent seen anything sketchy except a few obvious scams (seller with low reviews selling items for unbelievable price, probably stolen account etc.).

Now, I found a listing for really cheap headphones at 2 USD, they usually sells for way over 10 USD. I noticed a surge of buyers for the item under a short period of time, none of them had any feedback. I kept following the listing and saw no more purchases except mine, and now they're suddenly increased to 50 USD (This part makes no sense to me either, they simply cant be expected to sell at this price).

About the surge of buyers with no feedback, do sellers ever purchase their own items to make the product seem more attractive? This surge of no feedback buyers instantly put the item to ""86 % sold"".


The seller has lots of feedback, so I feel a bit stupid making this thread.

Ebay,Just want to cover all my bases on a big ticket sale. Need advice.,"http://i.imgur.com/VZFzAOd.png?2

This is the buyers information.  Not a new buyer but they have very little feedback.  I have sold a pair of sneakers and have talked with some people on the r/sneakers sub.  They all seem to have the opinion that with sneakers there is a lot more scammers out there buying than there are for other items.

I have only once had an issue selling and that came down to the local post office being unable to deliver the item and not leaving a message for the buyer.  The item was just sitting at the post office.

I just really really want to make sure that I am doing everything possible to avoid losing a decent amount of money.

Let me know if you need any more information, etc.

Ebay,Ebay empty box scam again - denying my friend's claim,"Again this is for a friend, not me. She sold a video card on ebay for $750. We'll call this person ""buyer #1"" - their account got closed and ebay said not to send it to buyer #1.

So the transaction gets cancelled and she relists the item. She had to recall the item on UPS.

Someone with a paypal verified address buys the card. We'll call him buyer #2. Since she almost got scammed by #1, she had me video tape herself packaging up the box with the item in it. 

Buyer #2 gets the item and claims the box was empty. His only ""proof"" is that she entered 2 pounds for the item weight, and that the video card weighs over 3 pounds. But her UPS invoice shows the box actually weighed 7 pounds. He outright claims that he even WEIGHED the box and it was only 2 pounds, so he's lying.

Ebay is telling her to pound sand and so is paypal.

What recourse is there besides trying to sue buyer #2? They're basically just giving her the run around. Paypal is saying it's ebay's fault and ebay is saying to take it up with paypal. They won't even transfer her to a supervisor.

Ebay,"Sold a phone on eBay, now the buyer wants to return it with a so called burn in damage","I sold a Galaxy S6 recently and the buyer just received it today and said that the phone has a burn in damage.

The buyer received it today saying there is burn in damage and the damage is not even visible to the eye, and also he took a picture very close to the phone, that you can't tell if this is the exact color of the phone (green emerald). My mistake is I didn't record the serial number, nor the IMEI so let's say he returns it with a problematic phone that is not even mine, how do I deal with it?

Ebay,Dealing with (what feels likes) a sketchy buyer,"Hi, I need advice: I'm a seller having successfully sold clothing for the past year (up to now without any issues). I recently listed an item of fine jewelry ($300) and immediately received a message asking to drop the price down to $180. I responded that I was firm at the asking price and the user sent two follow-up messages saying he was short on money and asking would I take pity on him, help him out since he ""loved"" the item, and accept $180 if he ""paid right away."" I didn't respond to these messages. His location was listed as international (I'm in the U.S.), and I (falsely) assumed since I do not ship outside the U.S., I would be fine. His messages were rife with spelling errors/typos.

The user ended up purchasing the item. He has a domestic shipping address, a packing/shipping place located near the U.S. border. After paying, he messaged asking me to send the item right away and to provide the original certification documents for the item, which I clearly stated in the listing I no longer have (I have scanned copies, which I said I will provide). I reiterated this in my response but haven't heard back. I haven't sent the item but have always intended to do so with necessary tracking/insurance/signature confirmation given its value.

I'm very wary of completing the transaction. The user has been registered since 2012 but only has a feedback score of 4 (not that it's a red flag on its own), all from transactions completed within the past month. All the items he purchased (all similar items to mine) have been removed from eBay and it seems as though he's recently changed his user name. I don't know how to proceed and don't want to get scammed, nor do I want to sacrifice my feedback/reputation as a seller. Should I proceed with the transaction? What other actions can I take?

Ebay,Item Paid For Yesterday At 9:00 p.m. Does It Need To Be Shipped Today? 1 Day Shipping.,"Hello,

I am trying to do 1 day shipping on most of my items to take advantage of TRS benefits.  I sold an item yesterday and they paid for it at 9:00 p.m.  My question is does that need to still be shipped the following business day? Or is there a cut off time they need to pay by? I work full time, so if a customer pays late in the afternoon I have time to prep and ship.  However, if a customer pays at 9 p.m. I don't prep and ship until the following morning.  I have to wake up earlier than normal to get it ready.  Just checking to see if this could have waited until tomorrow or if it needed to be scanned today.

Buyer purchases Military Surplus vest

I can't be bothered and pay Ebay Return costs (£2.99) 

Buyer closes Ebay return, opens PayPal return

I do nothing, waiting for item

Buyer Escalates to Dispute

I received Item, stinks of Cigarettes (Even after being hung outside for a week!!) 

Gave refund because I had the Item.

So I thought it was all done and the buyer had his refund and was 'happy' but then today, the buyer messages me :

I need you to reimburse the return postage of £11.00 via Paypal within 7 days for item 30xxxxxxxxx.
If this is not done I will take you to court to obtain my money with the attendant extra costs that will entail.

Ebay,Expensive return/refund question.,"* My 1st time dealing with this as a buyer. The item value's fairly expensive $600+. I purchased  a 36 inch 10K gold chain from a big seller with 96% feedback score. Chain arrived, 1st thing I noticed it was short, so I measured it @ 30 inches, the width &amp; the color also looked off.

 * I tested it twice(2 different jewelers) both determined it was gold plated stainless. I contacted the seller immediately(same day it arrived). We've been in constant contact &amp; professional. I filed a INAD claim w/ E-Bay complete with pics &amp; video.

* My question is now the seller has accepted my return &amp; sent the return label. Am I safe to send it back. Because as I delved deeper in to their feedback I see a few buyers claimed that they returned jewelry only to have seller state that what they received wasn't the original jewelry sent. 

* E-Bay can step in on the 19th(2 days from now) should I just wait &amp; escalate it to them as I know all my evidence would be a instant close in my favor should they intervene.

 Sorry if this is a open &amp; shut case &amp; I just return it for my refund. But I do not want a long drawn ordeal if they try to dispute &amp; say it's not was initially sent.

Ebay,Vendor is drastically revising international shipping delivery estimate after money was paid for maximum speed,"Hi, I paid for a small work-related object to be shipped from the US to my location via USPS within 4-6 business days or August 11-15, with the shipping alone being more than twice the cost of the object.

I filed a complaint on August 16 (a date within a shipping range with cheaper delivery), saying that I want the item, as opposed to wanting the refund. Ebay then notifies me that I have to wait until August 22 to request a refund.

I just got an email from the vendor saying the following:

&gt; International Expedited delivery may need 2-3 weeks, if holiday or custom delay, it may need longer. The package is pretty small. Please pay attention to your mail box, and the post master who delivers your daily mails. If you need us to provide any help to work with you, please feel free to email us.

I don't blame them for a few days' late delivery. But this is something else. They're throwing away the delivery estimate altogether.

I would have never used the vendor if I was going to wait 2-3 weeks. I'm willing to pay much more for any other vendor if they can get it to me in courier-like time; the shipping cost is already courier-like, on top of an actual delivery time that is priced at less than what I paid for. Can I get part of the shipping cost refunded? What if I get the item before August 22 from somewhere else? Can I refuse a redundant late delivery and get a refund? Am I being unreasonable?

Ebay,"Update on ""Should I be a silver level Powerseller?""","Original Post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/4x0nja/should_i_be_a_silver_level_powerseller/).

I emailed Ebay 3 times about this and called once. Two times the representatives said ""No, you don't meet the requirements"" and the other two times they agreed that I did meet the requirements.

Anyway, I replied to one of the reps who agreed that I met the requirements (after my latest evaluation period) and they manually upgraded my Powerseller level.

One reason I thought this is important is because I read that a higher Powerseller rating would improve the search results for my listings.

Ebay,GSP item damaged - buyer indicates very poor packing. Best option to make eBay cover this?,"Shipped a pair of speakers, extremely - and I mean *EXTREMELY* well packed. Individually wrapped in cardboard, then shrink wrapped, then bubble wrapped, then corners reinforced with tape to prevent bubble wrap puncture, then placed in a large box with ample packing peanuts. Totally gorilla proof. 




Sure enough, buyer writes me (with photos) that they were damaged and expressed his ""displeasure"" at the poor packing job. Clearly the fine folks in Kentucky repacked to make the box smaller and are at fault. 





I am seeing two options. eBay states in my message that I can open a case on the 26th (today is the 20th) on items damaged after leaving the GSP center. I also see where many sellers have been told to have the buyer open a SNAD case and have seller / buyer protection kick in. 



This is absolutely not my fault, and I am DONE, and I mean F'n DONE with GSP - but I have a buyer to satisfy and I am definitely not eating this. eBay / Pitney Bowes should. What have you run into?

Exchange rate: BGN1.00 = EUR 0.49

Ebay,Odd week. Three damaged packages with 2 missing contents and the third damaged during GSP. What to do next?,"Not only is this occurrence rare, but it happened twice on my last shipment of packages.

One package arrived opened with Gatorade bottles inside to simulate the weight. It was a Medium FR Box. It obviously needed ripped open. The side box tabs were inside, which I found odd. It was taped up with normal tape  afterwards. Value of the item was $200. I've shipped 30 or so of the same thing with no issues. 

A couple days later another package, this time a baseball bat in a long tube triangle priority package was delivered open, empty with a red stamp on it that said ""Received Damaged"". Value was $50. Box was obviously squished

The first case I don't believe the buyer. He said they found a cheaper item of the same type and wants a refund. I checked where they said the got it and didn't find listed or sold. They got defensive when I asked. I filed a report with USPS and an IC3 report. This case is in Return ""Missing Parts/Pieces"" and will go to eBay the moment it can once the buyer is able. Looks like my best move is to refund them, file for insurance and get my $50 back, lose the item and the difference. THis is to avoid going to eBay's decision and file in the buyers favor and get a defect.

Case 2 pretty easy...just file a claim to get my $50 back and refund the buyer ASAP. Then let this one go unfortunately. 

Case 3 was a damaged box shipped via GSP and damaged after GSP mailed it. The buyer wants to keep the item. What do I have to do?

Ebay,A quick beginner's question,"I've been trying to sell my Macbook Air for a little over a week now. Somebody offered me $400 (starting price is $500) and I made a counter offer of $450. Before I made the counter offer, my 'Best offers from buyers' box had his name in it at $400. Now, somebody who offered 300$ name's in the box. Does this mean they retracted their offer, or does this automatically happen when you make a counter offer? Thanks.

Ebay,Digital Item Issue,"Hey everyone! First time I've come across this issue, was just wondering how everyone would proceed:

I have been selling digital trading cards (yeah, it doesn't make sense to me either) as of late. Every transaction I have had up to this point has gone off without a hitch- the buyer makes the purchase, pays, messages me their username on the app to receive the cards, I send the cards to them, and done. In this last transaction, someone purchased a lot of cards, paid, but has not given me their username. I reached out to the buyer and asked for the username and have no received a response back. I made it very clear in my listing that these are not for physical cards, so I assume if the buyer disputes the transaction then eBay will help me out, but I have not heard a word from the buyer, good or bad. 

Obviously I cannot mark these as shipped, since I have not sent anything..will this damage my eBay reputation in any way if it just remains unshipped until I hear from the buyer? Otherwise I have no other way of sending the cards off to the person's app.

Ebay,Selling: acceptance of refund on an unauthorized account purchase?,"So, I was printing a label for an iPhone that I ""sold"" yesterday, when I got a message from eBay stating that the purchase was unauthorized by the account owner.

I almost didn't catch it in time, because the username had been changed about the same time that I bought the postage, and I didn't realize they were talking about the same order until I saw the item number.

After seeing this, I voided the shipping label and hit the cancel order button. Crisis narrowly avoided.

My question is, if this account was compromised, is the buyer going to be able to log in and accept the cancellation or will eBay step in and authorize it?

Should I just go ahead and try to contact eBay? I'd like to get this damn thing relisted for the third time so that hopefully a real transaction can take place.

Ebay,"Unwarranted Negative Feedback from Problem Buyer, Advice Please","Hi there! I just want to get your opinion on something I recently experienced, which I'll detail below. 

A few weeks ago, I sold a Japanese import collectible toy that was just released around July 28 of this year. When the buyer received it, he sent me an email asking why the one he bought from ""Japan"" had an ""HKG Sticker"" while the one I sold him didn't have it. He was asking if I could verify the authenticity of the item I sold. 

His question arrived in my mail around 11:50am. I saw his question around noon after lunch time, and I gave him a well detailed answer at around 1pm, complete with proof/evidence/video from multiple sources and even big name stores that what I sold him was authentic and the other item he bought from ""Japan"" from another seller is actually from Hong Kong because the HKG sticker means it was sold by a Hong Kong distributor. 

So there take note, his question arrived at around 11:50am, while I sent him an answer at around 1pm. It took less than two hours for me to give him all the necessary proof and materials to show him that what I sold him was authentic. When I got back to ""My Ebay"", I noticed that my feedback points went down by one. When I checked what was wrong, I found out that the same buyer already left me a negative feedback that stated something along the lines of ""Authenticity Questioned, Seller Didn't Respond"". Of course, that's DEFINITELY FALSE because #1, I have already shown him proof that the product I sold was authentic (pictures/reviews from trusted sources/Japanese sites that show the same item I sold/even the website of the Hong Kong distributor with the HKG sticker he was curious about/and of course I even had the invoice from the authentic place I got my stuff from), and #2, I answered his question in less than 2 hours of it arriving in my mail!

I politely and nicely asked this buyer to revise his feedback using that Ebay form. I never heard from the guy again and today was the last day for him to revise it and it's already over. 

Of course I ""replied"" to his feedback, stating the exact time I received his question and the exact time I sent my answer, as well as a very short summary that explains the authenticity of my products (can't really write a detailed explanation when you only have limited characters). 

In summary: Guy bought item, had doubts and thought maybe it was bootleg, asked me about its authenticity, gave me a negative immediately without even waiting for my answer and evidence which arrived in less than 2 hours after he sent his query, and now I'm stuck with a negative feedback.

Is there a way to remove this sort of unjustified feedback? When I was looking at Ebay's feedback/defect policy, it didn't say anything about false accusations from buyers. It only said Ebay can only remove negative feedback if it includes personal details, attacks, and bad words. Unfortunately, the only thing the buyer's feedback contains is impatience and false accusations.

I've already blocked this buyer becuase I don't want to deal with this kind of problematic person who immediately leaves a negative feedback without even waiting for an answer... an answer which he received in less than 2 hours after sending his question!

Is this something to just ignore and move on about or is this something I can take to Ebay to remove? Thanks in advance for your advice!",11,3,2016-08-23,EBAY,0.10568059980869293,0.867149829864502,0.02716962620615959

Ebay,Item Not Received case just opened on closed UPI case?,"I sold an item a month ago, sent two invoices, buyer never paid. Nothing new, so I let the Unpaid Item Assistant take care of it. EBay closed the case and refunded my final value fees. No big deal, right?

Which is why I'm more than a little confused by the Item Not Received case that this buyer just opened today for the same unpaid item.

I went back and double checked all of the details on the transaction (which turns out to be incredibly frustrating to do once a case has been open and closed.) 

Sure enough, there was no payment received/recorded. Resolution Center shows the UPI case closed, but then let this INR case for the same item be opened. 

The buyer is now asking me to ""explain"" and provide a refund. (Well, uh...if you don't pay, then yeah, you probably aren't going to receive the item?)

To be fair, the buyer has only a handful of feedback and a relatively new account, so I think this is probably a case of a clueless beginning buyer. So I've replied to the buyer with a polite explanation that I'm just as confused as he/she is, but since I never received payment for the item, then eBay cancelled the transaction, etc.

Of course, the problem is that I now have this open INR case in the Resolution Center and the only three options provided are adding tracking details (nonexistent since, well, unpaid item), to refund the buyer (a little difficult since, well, unpaid item), or to send the buyer a message (which I've done). 

So unless the buyer realizes ""Oh, she's right, I never paid for that,"" and closes the INR claim, then I'm not sure how else to proceed.

Ebay,Ebay is screwing me,"Recently I sold an iPhone 6s that could be activated under Sprint's network. A week or two after selling it the customer complained how when he went to the sprint store to try and activate the phone, the employees said it could not be activated and opened a return case, even though I put I don't accept returns on my listing. I knew this was fishy, as I knew for a fact the phone would work with Sprint. I contacted Sprint via chat and explained to them my situation. They gladly told me that the phone was eligible to be activated on their network. I took screenshots of the chat and uploaded them to the return case. Immediately after, the buyer explains to me he wants to setup the phone on ting, a different phone network, basically revealing the he lied about going to the Sprint store. The phone will not work on this network and will only work on sprint, just like I advertised. I immediately called eBay and a very nice lady said that I was in that right, as I had proof my item worked and all I had to do was wait 2 days for me to escalate the case to eBay. I waited the 2 days and then asked eBay to review the case. Within a hour, eBay responded saying they sided with the buyer. I called eBay to refute this, but they said I can only appeal the case decision when I issue the buyer a full refund. I am pissed. Why would eBay even allow you to select if you'd accept returns or not if they don't follow the seller's decision. Now, I'm going to be out about 25$ for shipping BOTH WAYS.

At first, I felt awful because I spent money on this code and I was about to give it away for basically free. After I start to look around: this person has been scamming many people. Many sellers have left bad reviews but with positive ratings. After seeing this I felt a little better because I spent the balance so now I have -$9.90. Is there anyway we can get this guy of eBay?

Wtf? Ok. How about $26? Nobody would decline an offer a mere .99 cents below their asking price with OBO. 

Automatic decline.

What could they possibly be trying to accomplish with this?

Ebay,Fastest way to earn 100 positive feedbacks?,"I've been selling on my mother's ebay account and have enjoyed the luxury of funds hitting my account instantly after a sale. This is the way it should be IMHO, especially considering that eBay already has the buyer's back.. and then there's Paypal, but I digress.

Well I recently opened my own account, and was unfortunate to learn that Paypal holds my funds until 3-5 days after the buyer receives his item.. that's a LONG time, taking business days into consideration. I learned that I need 100 positive *seller* feedbacks before this holding will go away. That's a pretty big feat for somebody who doesn't have a steady stream of items to sell.

I'm wondering, what items could help accumulate these feedbacks relatively quickly? I ship next day so that's not an issue, but the item type and method of shipment would need to be reasonable.

Ebay,Is there customs/duty on free international shipping items?,"Hi, 

I recently bought an item from a Chinese company on ebay, the item was priced $2 and when it arrived I was told there was $5 custom duty/importing fees I had to pay. 
Although Ebay says it'll declare any custom importing fees on checkout, seller says free international shipping, I still payed over twice the price of the item.

Were those actually import fees or did I get screwed by some post office guy? How do you go about these? Is there a way to minimize them or remove them at all even if I was in contact with the seller?

Yes I know $5 is nothing but it's my first international purchase and I'll either make it again but with more quantity or choose a different product.

Ebay,Seller decided not to sell - only sent partial refund.,"Done a BIN for approx £100 in the middle of the night, woke up the next day to a message saying they have ""decided not to sell"" and have refunded me.

I replied explaining that it is not cricket to pull out of a sale like that, ebay is binding blah blah.  

I got no response so that night I left feedback [factual neg].

However later on I noticed the refund icon on ebay was different... it was the partial refund one, and upon checking, they have refunded me about £3 less than the full amount.

I have pulled the contact info from ebay and text the seller, they replied with a huge WOT babbling about their partner running off with the laptop and paypal talked them through the refund and advised them to do it this way.

Could this be a scam for &lt;£3?

Both ebay and paypal tell me to wait and file an INR to recover the rest.

Ebay,"Buyer paid, requested cancel, then everything else happens","I am selling an item on eBay for $200+. Last night, someone purchased the item. A user with 0 feedback, but has been a member since mid-2014. Once the item was purchased, I received two messages from the buyer. The first one was simply ""Is there a receipt?"" The second message came 20 minutes later asking to cancel the order over a detail that was clearly pictured and should have been looked at prior to purchase. I got home late, replied to the second one asking them to elaborate on their reasoning, figuring I would probably be fine with a cancel (because they are inexperienced and all), and went to bed. 

Then this morning I woke up and checked ebay. I had received two messages from eBay titled ""MC010 Account Security Communication Partner Warning."" Both came in at the same time, are the exact same, and opened with 

""Our records show that you recently contacted or received messages from *username* through eBay's messaging system. This account was recently found to have been accessed by an unauthorized third party, who may have used the account in an attempt to defraud other members.

We've taken action to restore this account to the original owner, but wanted to let you know to be suspicious of any communication you may have received from them. Nothing is wrong with your account at this time – this message is just being sent as a precaution. If you have received any messages from *username* that appears suspicious, please feel free to forward them to us at *ebay email* for review.""

The message then goes on to describe several situations on what to do if I bought an item from, or sold an item to, this user. But they only describe what to do if the item has been shipped, which it hasn't, being that the item was purchased last night. 

I also got a third message from eBay titled ""eBay listings removed - unauthorized user of buyer or bidder account"" where they said they had to cancel bids and purchases made on the item I sold, that any associated fees were credited to my account. (I checked, and that process has already taken place). 

I still have the option to purchase and print a shipping label for this item, but of course have not done that. The icon showing whether feedback has been left for me has been hyphened out (as in, the option for the user to leave feedback for me has been removed). 

Here's the other thing. I checked my paypal account, and the money is there, and the name on the paypal transaction matches the name on the ebay transaction (though that could easily be fraud as well). 

So my question is, what do you guys think I should do in this situation? One of ebay's links in their messages redirected to a totally useless page (still on the ebay site).

Ebay,"Filed PayPal dispute for partial refund of cancelled products (2/5 items), seller did not respond, awarded full refund for all 5 items. What next?","This just happened.  Roughly a month ago there was a 20% off tech coupon floating around, so I used it and grabbed $2009.00 worth of tech off an eBay store for roughly $1600. I was pretty happy until I got an email from the store saying that a couple of the parts I'd ordered were not in stock, in spite of them still claiming to have 10+ available even after mentioning this to me. 

Anyway I let them know that that wasn't an issue, and politely asked if they would be okay to cancel the order for those 2 items (which made up $563.20 out of the 1600), and refund their value to my PayPal.  They agreed and sent out the items that were still in stock (which I am very happy with) but I never saw the partial refund for the cancelled items.  Every time I contacted them they told me that I was required to contact PayPal for the partial refund since there was a coupon involved, which struck me as a little odd.  However I did give them a call and PayPal were just as confused as I was, telling me that the seller should simply be able to provide a partial refund.  After I next contacted the seller they claimed that they had already put the refund through, but once I called PayPal I was told that no such effort had been made.

This went on for about 2 weeks before I escalated to a claim.  I immediately emailed the seller letting them know, and they replied telling me that for a refund I would be required to close the dispute.  Of course I was not about to close the dispute without the money in my hand after being mucked around so much, so I waited it out.

Finally last night, a full month later, I recieved an email from PayPal telling me that the dispute was resolved in my favour and I had been credited not the $563.20 partial refund I was seeking, but the full $2009.00 that ALL the items were valued at.  Apparently this happened because the seller did not respond at all to the dispute, and made no effort to issue the partial refund.    

Anyway I'm at a bit of a loss for what to do next.  I'm extremely happy with the items that were sent, and was only seeking a refund for the items that were cancelled.  Any advice would be very much appreciated.  Is there more I should do through PayPal or should I attempt to recontact the seller directly?

Ebay,Buyer has opened a case for an item I didn't receive payment for.,"(Apologies in advance for the wall of text.)

I am a regular UK seller on Ebay and have been for about six years, but this is a first.

On 24th July, I sold an item at auction to an American buyer.  It said in the description that I required payment within three days of *the auction ending.  As no payment was received and the buyer wouldn't respond to messages, I opened an unpaid item case.  He still hadn't paid by 1st August, so I closed the case and received a final fee refund.  I considered the matter closed.

Cut to today.  The buyer sends me a message asking where his item is.  I replied saying, very politely, that I didn't receive any payment.  I told him that I opened a non-payment case against him which refunded me the final fees and that I wouldn't have been able to do that if he'd paid, and I sent him screenshots of the unpaid item case.  An hour later, he has somehow been able to open a case against me, demanding that I refund him.  A refund for something I haven't received a payment for.

I am beyond confused.  I've been through my Paypal account with a fine toothcomb and I definitely didn't receive payment.  I had a live chat with Ebay support (a person, not a bot) who re-confirmed that the item definitely wasn't paid for, so I definitely didn't screw up.  They moved the conversation on to the special support team who said the same thing, but as I'm in the UK and the buyer is in America, the whole matter has been moved from ebay.co.uk to ebay.com.  I've been told that I should receive an e-mail about it within the 24 to 48 hours, but if this matter isn't resolved by Wednesday, the money will automatically be taken out of my Paypal account.

Could someone please explain to me what the expletive is happening here?  Has this happened to anyone else and what was the outcome?  How was the buyer able to open a case against me nearly a month after I closed an unpaid item case against him?  I'm even wondering if this is some kind of hacker / scammer as I don't see how the option of opening a case would even be available to him.  How can I prove that I definitely didn't receive payment from him and I am not ripping him off?  Can I stop Ebay from taking money that I cannot afford to lose out of my Paypal account?  I have screenshots of absolutely everything related to this on Ebay, and a screenshot of my Paypal account that shows I did not receive any money from him between 24th July and 1st August, the only time he would have been able to pay for it.  This all came to light a couple of hours ago, so maybe I'm posting this too soon, but I am beyond worried here.

Thank you in advance for any advice or information that you are able to give me.

TL;DR:  Buyer didn't pay, I opened a case and was refunded my seller's fee, buyer opened a case demanding a refund a month later.  WTF?

___

EDIT:  Received an e-mail from ebay.com.  They too have confirmed that the item wasn't paid for and have closed the case in my favour.  As relieved as I am, I would still like to know how this was allowed to happen in the first place, and ebay have told me that should the buyer leave unfavourable feedback, they will remove it.  They shouldn't be allowed to give me feedback!  They didn't pay for the bleeping item!

Ebay,"What do you do when a buyer requests a return on products that, by nature, cannot be resold again?","According to many Google searches, having a return policy is a must and you need to consider what to do when someone requests a refund, even if you select ""Do not accept returns.""  

I had a buyer tell me that they were not going to be in the COUNTRY when I had sent a package.  They sent this to me a day after I shipped and told me that they had a family emergency and so they'd be leaving the country.  I obviously have the person's address and know that they don't live on the border of Canada or Mexico so they probably flew out which is not just a 1 day thing.  Regardless, I tell them of the circumstances and say that I will need them to let me know the condition of the package and I can do a refund accordingly.

He then tells me the package came entirely destroyed and that I needed to refund him the full price.  Note, they told me they were leaving the COUNTRY so they could not be there to receive the package and then he turns around and tells me the package is completely destroyed upon receipt.

The item in question is cosmetics and he tells me moisture somehow got into the package and ruined everything (eye shadow).  I don't even resell these packages if they're opened because I don't want someone to get contaminated products so I lose full value if he wants to return, which is why I have no refunds available (except for ebays' buyer protection, which this guy very well may have abused).

Obviously ebay sided with him and I'm out both my product, which was never returned (since he claims it was destroyed) and I lose my money.  How is this fair?  I have a no refund policy on my products since I sold (in the past) cosmetics and supplements.  Due to the nature of those products, I cannot resell them so I protect myself with no refunds, which I should be entitled to as a seller.  But according to ebay, the buyer can get whatever he wants as long as he tells ebay the right things.  Is it even worth selling on ebay, with the margins I make, one case like this can negate 10+ sales (considering the make up is worth like $20+ a unit).  I have sold over $4k worth of cosmetics in the summer and because of a few bad apples, I literally had half the profit I should have had.  I had whiny customers demand full refunds over nothing and if not they'd open cases against me and receive it anyways.  

How can anyone sell on ebay with conditions like this.  The buyer is literally ALWAYS right, even if they lie straight to your face and ebay's face about everything.  Profit margins are already shit cause fake products and Chinese sellers can afford to sell under everyone else and now I can't even hold my profits cause someone can whine about a product 21 days after purchase and demand a full refund.",7,4,2016-08-28,EBAY,0.15512113273143768,0.8206119537353516,0.024266891181468964
Ebay,Need a bit of advice buying an iPhone 6S,"So I see a nice listing right now going for an iPhone 6S at a fantastic price. I am assuming this price will jump up as time gets closer to the listing's end. It's brand new, pictures show the box only and the IMEI/Serial # of the phone. I asked the seller where he/she got the phone from and they said they won it from work via raffle, and they also have no need for it as their son loves to play with their phones and occasionally break them. This all sounds plausible to me but it dawned on me later that this could be a clean phone... for now.

The IMEI checks out clean, serial # is clean, but I have heard of scams where people buy a phone from their carrier, sell it, then immediately stop paying for their phone... the fact that this phone was won and locked to a specific carrier, makes me question if I should purchase it or not, shouldn't raffles be giving out UNLOCKED phones rather than locked to carriers?.

Ebay,"A seller doesn't accept returns, but could I still get a refund through ebay if I buy something and they mislead in the subscription? Please help?","Title. So, basically... I bought a digital copy of Gta 5 for the xbox one for a good price. (About 15 less than other posts of the same game). I, like a dummy, didn't read the description. (This kind of branches off in Xbox one territory btw) Apparently they were selling it by letting the buyer log into their xbox account and download it on their xbox. I expected a digital code to be emailed, though they did say in the description that they'd sell it that way. They also aren't accepting returns.

Now, I know I was in the wrong for not paying attention and reading the subscription, and I wouldn't ask for a refund if it was an actual physical item. But the thing is that their description stated ""After the download is finished you can sign out and delete the account and play with your own profile"" and ""The game will permanently be on your xbox one""

 Now, as far as I'm aware, license transferring on the xbox doesn't work like that. Once you download a game from some one else's account, in order to play it, you have to set that account's home console as your xbox. It even says on the home console section something along the lines of ""Set this xbox as your home console so you can share your content with anyone else on this xbox"" Meaning games, apps, etc. Not to mention if I factory reset my xbox(Whch I've had to do multiple times in the past) I won't be able to redownload the game without using their profile again and buying it myself. They even say not to set the account's home console as yours, so how do they expect you to play the game?

I feel like this isn't a fair situation because I bought the game for my little brother, plus I'm usually really timid and I hate confrontation, but I don't think this is right. Again, I know it's mostly my fault, but are they even allowed to sell a game that way? For the reasons I stated, they technically aren't selling you anything, and I feel like the description is misleading because you kinda do need their account to actually play the game, but they want you to delete it after the game is downloaded. Plus it just doesn't sit right with me, as they could literally ""sell"" the digital copy of the game to multiple people and make enough to buy it 10 times over. Heck, I have tons of games that I could sell that way, but again, I'm pretty sure you have to set the account's home console as the receiving xbox which means you wouldn't be able to have your own xbox as home console.

So... My main question is... Would seeking a refund through ebay if the seller refuses to give me one be justified, or is this a lost cause and I should just drop it? I'm really kind hearted and like I said I know it's my fault plus it was only 30 so I'm debating dropping it (Plus I don't want to cause my mom to get negative feedback or anything since I know it's my fault) but at the same time I feel like I've been scammed and if I bought my brother the same game from another seller not only would I have spent 70 or so for one game, but I'd be broke.

TLDR: I didn't read the description of an item and bought it. The seller doesn't accept returns. I feel like they mislead me due to the fact that they ""sell"" you the game by letting you use their xbox profile to download it and want you to delete it afterwards, but as far as I'm aware, you literally have to have their account set as home console to play the game. Am I justified in seeking a refund through ebay? Again, please help.


EDIT: I just want to thank you guys for your help. This is the first time I've encountered this, as I haven't used ebay much in the past and I'm really clueless. I'm not sure if I replied to every comment but just in case I didn't, I do make sure to read every comment. I'll contact ebay tomorrow and we'll go from there.

SUPERIOR EDIT: We applied for a refund today and we have to wait up to 4 days for them to contact us. At this point I'm not sure I'm going to get one. I mean, I know we deserve one, but it just doesn't seem likely, so I'm gonna try not to stress about it as much.",30,2,2016-08-28,EBAY,0.10041886568069458,0.876130223274231,0.023450909182429314

Ebay,Is it fair to leave neutral feedback?,"I bought an item awhile ago - I was going to wait a bit before leaving feedback, to see if they would even respond to try to fix the situation, but they've so-far ignored me. It was a figure from China - it was shipped horribly in a Styrofoam box. Not even a solid foam box that I've gotten figures shipped in before, but a box literately made from pieces of Styrofoam tapped together. 

The figure arrived broken with part of it snapped off. I can probably fix it (going to look into safe, effective glues on the material), but I contacted them asking if a partial refund would be possible (since shipping back to China would cost a lot). They asked me how much, and I asked if $10 sounded fair - I paid nearly $50 for the figure. I haven't gotten a response back, and it's been well... quite some time from the 4th, when it got here. I figured maybe $10 was fair, since I'm not sure how much they paid in shipping (it was 'free'), how much they initially paid on the item, etc... If I got a response that explained they would be loosing money and that it was 'relatively' minor damage (even though if they had the damn thing in an actual box it probably wouldn't have been broken), or a counteroffer of like $5, I would have been happy with SOME communication. I didn't hear anything back after a week, sent another message, and... Yeah. I don't see the point in sending a third one. 

I really don't have anything positive to say about the seller, other than the item arriving pretty quickly from overseas. That's the only positive thing I could even say. Is it fair to give them a neutral? I know sometimes things get damaged, that's the nature of shipping, but I'm really just upset they couldn't even give me the time of day. 

So I am wondering, should I have a neutral, or would a negative actually be more appropriate due do the relatively complete lack of communication and crappy packaging? I was thinking of leaving ""Arrived broken poor packaging &amp; was ignored after asking if $10 partial was fair"" as the feedback, so... Yeah. Any advice would be appreciated. If anyone wants, I can show the packaging they used for perspective... It was so flimsy.",24,14,2016-08-29,EBAY,0.05092878267168999,0.8968557715415955,0.05221543833613396
Ebay,"eBayer claiming that the diameter of a bangle is the outside of a bangle, not the inner diameter.","I brought a set of 12 Bollywood bangles for $7.19 AU. The product was both brought and sold in Australia, so that makes it slightly easier. The title described them as 70mm DIAOR in the title and 7cm diameter in the listing. I assumed a spelling mistake was made in the original title. When they arrived they were only 65mm in diameter and I sent a photo indicating that. 

They replied and said ""Hi there, diameter is from outer edges to outer edges. You can send it back for refund if not like"". I replied ""Will you also refund my postage?"" (They charged $1.99 for postage in the original listing).

Next reply from them ""Item is described as 70 mm never said inside....."". No mention of refunding my postage.

At this point I am wondering what to do. My first instinct is to contact eBay and go though their resolution centre stating that the item received is different to what the seller described.  I have brought countless bangles and never heard of sizing a bangle by giving the outside measurement. It makes no sense. But I thought I would check here first, just incase I was mental and I am in the wrong. 

The other problem I'm worried about is that when I send them back, they might claim that I didn't sent them. If I video sealing the packet and posting it, would that count as proof? I really don't want to have to pay for registered postage. The last time I had an issue with a product they said mark the package ""RETURN TO SENDER"" and they refunded my money and took care of everything. 

Thanks for any advice.

Edit: I filled in the INAD. I was interested in what you guys thought regarding the inner v's outer measurement, but I think I might be asking the wrong people seeing as some people were wondering how 5mm made that much of a difference. I really appreciate your help on my trivial matter.

Ebay,Is this worth the risk? (Freight forwarding laptop),"I sold a laptop on ebay.  The buyer had an address of Miami, but took five days to make payment and told me he was in the Dominican Republic.  I got his address in Miami and it is a freight forwarding company.  This triggered a few red flags for me:

1) The forwarding company will most likely repack the laptop, if they do a poor job and it gets damaged I will be held liable I'm sure.

2) The payment took 5 days to make and is from a different name than the original buyer (not even the same last name).  I realize this could be a family member but it starts to compound the concern, especially taking 5 days to make it.

3) Googling the address of the forwarding company triggers numerous scam alerts.  Since I imagine they have a large volume, I'm sure they have some dissatisfied customers.

Is this really worth it for 115 dollars?  Or should I cancel the order?  Unfortunately, with Ebay's track record of favoring buyers, the risk of being duped is higher, even if in this case the purchase is legit.    Please, if you have experience dealing with freight forwarding companies I welcome your feedback.
