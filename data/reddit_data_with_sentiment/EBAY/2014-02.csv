Ebay,Doing taxes for selling on eBay w/ 1099k,"Last year I was out of work and started selling things around the house, my parents are hoarders so I sold A LOT.

Ebay,Looking to salvage any recuperation in a no-item-received situation long after ebay's time limits have expired.,"I partially brought about this situation on myself -- I make no bones about it. 

However, if there's some way to recoup anything from this deceptive seller, or even just ""ding"" them (legally) I'd like to, just based on principle.

In May 2012, I purchased an art print from a UK seller.  I'm located in New York City.

I paid immediately in full.  A few days later the seller messaged me to ask if she could have extra time because she was hospitalized.  I agreed.  I realized the risk at the time but I have a few sick family members and my gut told me to demonstrate empathy.  

In early July 2012 the seller messaged me a thank you and that she was going to mail the print the next day. Pretty normal so far - and up until this point it may have all been true!   She marked it shipped but of course, I never received a tracking number or the print or any further communication.

The seller's account then goes inactive.  At that point there's no avenue for recourse through ebay/paypal because it's been too long.  I gave up because I thought that the seller had disappeared into the ether.

Fast forward to last night (Feb 3, 2014), when an account with a very similar (but different) name posts the same print for sale. 

I unassumingly message her through the current auction explaining the situation and she feigns no memory of the interaction and asks why I didn't get in touch with her sooner, and a zillion excuses.  She signs the message with the same real name as the seller had.  I've asked her point blank to either send me the print or a refund -- and that I'll provide any past correspondence and receipts that she wants.  So far, she has not been receptive and is maintaining the pattern of deception.

Is there anything I can do (legally) to get some recourse here if she doesn't comply?  

Again, I know that I made a poor judgement call and the time for action may have passed. However, based on principle because of the particular manner in which she is exploiting my empathy, I would to at least explore if I have any options.  

Thank you for reading.",3,2,2014-02-04,EBAY,0.08883710205554962,0.8839553594589233,0.027207598090171814

I do not have the ability to change the shipping address since I'm shipping to the Global shipping program. What should I do?

Or I'm thinking of just trying to get out of this transaction because I don't want to risk being scammed.

**Paypal** says (I blocked users name but it looks to be Chinese): 

&gt; Payment From:	
Xxxx Xxx    (The sender of this payment is Non-U.S. - Unverified)

------------------------------------------

Some side questions: 

1.) If I ship out to the global shipping center, who's responsible when a customer claims he did not receive his item? Will buyer protection protect me?

2.) Can sellers refuse to sell to 0 feedback buyers? I usually have no problems with 0 feedback buyers because ""hey, everyone has to start from somewhere"", but I do often see listings that say they will deny 0 feedback buyers or bidders.

Ebay,Question about canceling a transaction/relisting it,"7 days ago I posted an item on ebay as a 7 day auction. On my product page I put that I will only ship to the lower 48 states, and that I ship via USPS Flat Rate boxes. On the 6th day of the auction someone with a brand new account (2 days old) from Belarus bid on my item. I messaged them and thanked them for their interest, but requested they not bid again because I will not ship to Belarus. They were outbid on the 7th day, and they bid again. They were out bid by two more users, and I guess by then they had set a higher auto-bid number and ended up winning the auction. I messaged them again informing them that I will have to contact Ebay to get it canceled. I called Ebay and after waiting a while in the queue I talked with a very odd woman who walked me through the canceling process due to the fact that I will not ship to the winner's country. We got off the phone and I finished my cancel request. It was then that I found out the winner has 7 days to respond to my request. So my questions are, do I have to wait 7 days  in order to relist the item? and, is this process not a little absurd for canceling? I was going to call Ebay back an ask about relisting but I figured it might be quicker and more informative to ask /r/ebay.

Ebay,"Seller promised to replace item that never arrived, now claiming no stock, but have that numerous copies of same item listed in store at 30% extra ... where do I stand?","Hi,

Having an odd experience with a seller on ebay and wanting some information re: what my position as a buyer is in this case. Apologies if there was an easier way to find an answer to this question (I tried!).

Ordered a hard to find video game from a vendor (high volume seller, 100+k feedback), item never arrived. Seller claimed to have investigated with postage service and found that it was lost in the post. This made me somewhat skeptical since the item was not sent via registered, but seller offered to send replacement item.

However, was later contacted by seller claiming they have no stock of the game and cannot replace it so they'll offer me a store credit or refund. Now, I've got no problem with this, however, they still have the listing up for the game I bought, showing that they have more than 10 copies available at a higher cost than what I paid.

I pointed this out to the seller and asked if it would not be possible to send one of those copies as the replacement. Their answer was that the listing was a mistake and they will investigate it but the listing is still up and have insisted that I accepted the offered refund right away.

My personal opinion on what has happened is that the price they were initially charging for the game (the one I bought it at) was under market rates and now they have realised it and are refusing to honour my purchase.

A quick check of their feedback shows that other buyers have experienced the same thing from seller.

So what are my rights as a buyer here? Is my only option to just take the refund? Ideally I'd like to get the game I purchased since it'll be troublesome to find the game elsewhere.

Any advice, Reddit?",11,4,2014-02-06,EBAY,0.0511191263794899,0.9133046269416809,0.03557630628347397

Ebay,How to proceed when seller is harassing me after cancelled auction?,"Hi there, first time posting in this forum. I'm a pretty active buyer on eBay, have bought hundreds of items and even use to sell on there.

Anyway, recently I bought a $10 item and shipping was listed as $8. I paid immediately. A couple days later I received an invoice for $7 to cover additional shipping, or the seller offers the option of cancelling the transaction. I tell the seller that they can't ask for additional funds after the close of the auction. Seller cancels auction. I begrudgingly agree to also cancel auction. 

I left neutral feedback: They asked for more money for shipping after I paid. They canceled 

They responded: Cheap buyer, expected me to pay the difference in shipping then left

Then this morning, I received these emails (not eBay messages), minutes apart: 

&gt;you a worthless fucking cunt, and as soon as I can get back at you I will, you ugly fucking whore lesbian pig

and then...

&gt; have your address you fucking cunt, are you going to change that feedback

I've never encountered anything like this before, even in situations where I had left neutral/negative feedback. I'm going to search around eBay contacts to see who I'm supposed to contact, but wonder if any of you know off the top of your head how I should proceed to this type of harassment/threat. 

**Update: talked to eBay. The rep said that they will continue to monitor his account and see if they will receive similar calls about the seller. They cannot outright ban him right now because it was sent to my private email account and they can't verify the veracity of my claim (!!!). The rep suggested I contact gmail to block the emails (??

Ebay,Need some advice on a missing eBay package (as a seller),"So I helped my brother out by listing some vintage toys for him over the holidays. All of the sales went as planned, save for this one. We shipped out a package on the 31st of DECEMBER to Malaysia, and it never arrived. Normally, I'd think, hey, it got lost OVER THERE...but here's the rub: the last update was on Jan 1, when it departed a local sorting facility in Capitol Heights, MD (I reside in the DC metro area, so this is basically, oh, what, 20-30 miles from us.) Then radio silence. It never made it out of the US.

The customs form # can track an item until it leaves the US, sometimes until delivery. This is downright odd. 

Link to [USPS tracking](https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction!input.action?tRef=qt&amp;tLc=0&amp;tLabels=LC013260684US) for the item.

Bidder's upset, as am I, but we're both seeing if we can find it-he'd rather have the item than a refund, if possible. We called USPS and they are utterly perplexed and useless.

Anyone else run across a similar issue? Any ideas on who to contact about fixing this? I know, it's a long shot, but sometimes someone has an idea, number, name, whatever. 

Yes, we talked to the local postmaster. Useless. Yes, we called 1-800-ASK-USPS. They claimed they'd get back to us. They didn't, and instead surveyed us about how good the quality of service was, hilariously.

Ebay,What outcome can I expect being the victim of a chargeback scam?,"In 7 years selling on eBay this has never happened to me. Over 3 months ago a buyer made two large purchases on the same day worth $550 and $200. I combined the shipment. although they were two separate transactions, they were going to the same address. 1 package shipped via FedEx Ground within 1 day of payment and the package was delivered 3 days later. 

I did NOT include signature confirmation! (palm to face).  

I do have proof of delivery through FedEx tracking. 

Both me and the buyer live in California. 

The buyer has a confirmed address. 

Yesterday the buyer opened a chargeback claim through PayPal on both purchases. Reason: Unauthorized payment on both. 

Usually I try to assume good faith but Im pretty sure this is a scam. The buyer only had 2 feedback and nothing since then. I found this guy on facebook and he looks like a hood rat thug, baggy jeans and fanning out 20 dollar bills like he's a high roller.  

So, what recourse do I have here? Did I screw myself by not including signature confirmation? The buyer never claimed not received or not described, so Im not sure how much signature confirmation bears on this case.

Ebay,Advice please (Buyer says item doesn't match description),"I sell only a few items now and then. I recently sold a holster for a gun. This is a hard plastic holster. As such, I took several detailed photos and stated it would only fit a gun that I knew 100% it would fit. In this case a PX4. There is also printing on the holster that says ""Beretta PX4"". So, could it fit other guns? Maybe, but unlikely. I said in the listing it would only fit a PX4. 

So, eventually it sold. Now the buyer has opened a case saying the item didn't fit the description and that it does not fit *his* PX4. He says he can provide pictures but as of yet has not. They are asking for a full refund. 

My question is: do I try to fight this? Do I issue the refund and ask him to send it back? Advice please. I always take detailed pictures and provide thorough descriptions and have never had this issue before. 

Edit: there are different types of PX4 (9mm, .40 caliber) but at the top and bottom of my description I put this ""MADE FOR BERETTA PX4 STORM, FULL SIZE .40 CALIBER""",13,9,2014-02-10,EBAY,0.025824401527643204,0.9402498006820679,0.03392576053738594
Ebay,eBay is becoming a major pain..,"I strictly use eBay to sell items around the house I no longer have any need for. So when I do sell, it will be in ""spurts"" and then I may not have anything to sell for a few months. Anyways, I have had the same account for probably close to ten years, I have 100% feedback rating, yet I have a $38.00 selling limit on my account for this month, which I have already met. I feel like eBay's expectations are not relevant to every individual. For example, if my boyfriend is off work, I will send him to the post office for me, when he tells me he dropped it off, I will update to ""shipped"" and when I get home I will update tracking if I have it. I am being punished for the delay in updating the tracking number so long after updating the item as shipped. Another being I didn't offer free shipping. Either way, they aren't going to like it. I just feel like every time I log into eBay something has changed and I am blocked from doing one thing or the other. Its a bit of a hassle. I feel like I am punished for not meeting their expectations, I don't sell on eBay as my career, I work full time, often long hours, and it seems impossible to meet their higher and higher expectations.

Ebay,Feedback for sellers who purchase postage right away but the take days to get it to the post office?,"I buy and sell many items on ebay. Most the items I buy are for personal use like games or electronics usually.

However what I noticed is that for example say I buy something Sunday night, they will purchase a postage label Monday but not get the package to the post office until like Thursday or Friday. I can understand if you are just selling a few items and you are busy with work or etc. But these are often power sellers with hundreds of items listed. 

I always get my stuff shipped out within 48 hours max. I even drop stuff off at the post office on Sundays because once an item sells I want to get it in the buyers hands ASAP. Anyways, I don't feel that sellers deserve positive feedback if the take days to get it into the mail, especially if they don't send me a message (I understand life happens, but you do have my money).

The first time I mentioned that it's a CDMA only phone. The second time, I put it in bold. The third time it went up for auction [this](http://i.imgur.com/zdPBY7E.png) is what my item description looked like.

Obviously this is really infuriating. I can understand it happening once. But this is three times in a row. Does anybody know if ebay will force users to make good on their bid?

Ebay,Anyone dealt with realtors before?,"Hello all,

Big lurker but love reading all the helpful info here. Much appreciated during my first month of selling.

My first case was open against me requesting info on a package that stated delivered but apparently not to the right address.

Looking into the tracking only shows so much, but it does state the package was DELIVERED to a nearby but DIFFERENT zip code than the one when I printed out the label(via Paypal). Both ebay/Paypal address show the same address. Either way, it DID get delivered somewhere. I'm currently on hold with USPS but I'm not sure how helpful they'll be or how much more information they'll be able to provide.

Here's where I think I start thinking too much into it..I google the address and do some looking into. The address seems to either be a real estate office(or use to be/ some links show closed business) or a empty lot for sale. Google Streetview doesn't give much help but shows an empty lot(not sure if the maps are old/wrong address)
 
Looking into the person's name shows he/she works as a realtor for a real estate company. The same company that is/was located at the address in question. What I didn't mention before is that in one of the USPS tracking update it shows ""Notice Left (No Secure Location Available) "" after it was Out For Delivery. So USPS must had some sort of response in order to delivered it after leaving notice right?
What I think is happening is the realtor is shipping to an old/unoccupied business location or place for sell that he/she deals with and after receiving the notice, they respond saying to deliver it to another address. By doing this, the buyer can claim the package wasn't delivered to their address(but actually was by them re-routing to another location) and open a case requesting redelivery/refund. The fact that the person is a realtor is what sparked this.

Or USPS just goofed and everything I said is wrong...been stuck inside too long due to the snow..

Thanks for reading regardless and any insight would be great.

Ebay,UK sellers - shipping to special domestic regions?,"Hello all

I've become more active as a seller on eBay UK and was wondering how you handled postage to special domestic regions (Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Scilly Isles, Scottish Islands, Scottish Highlands, Northern Ireland, Isle of Wight)?

I recently ran an auction for a bulky item with free shipping. It almost immediately attracted a bid and the bidder sent a message asking me to confirm that shipping was indeed free for this item. I checked his feedback as seller and saw he was in Northern Ireland. A quick google showed loads of posts of people complaining about losing money on shipping to NI when it wasn't blocked in their auctions, so I added it to my exception list and cancelled his bid. However, I had been planning on using myHermes to ship and it seems like there would have been no actual cost difference between shipping to NI and to a regular domestic postcode.

Do you block these special domestic regions or does it cut out too many potential buyers? What problems can you encounter when shipping to them?

Ebay,"For sellers, a few tricks to squeeze some extra cash from your eBay business","This post has two goals:
Maximize available money for your business, and maximize credit card rewards.

**Put your shipping and eBay fees on a credit card**

*eBay Fees*

Mouse-over 'Account.'  Go to 'Seller Account.'  Scroll down to Automatic Payments and change it to a credit card.

*Shipping*

If you use PayPal multiship, you have to use a work-around to do this.  It requires you empty your paypal into your bank account *each time before you ship.*  With $0 balance, paypal shipping will draw from your default funding source.  To check your funding source, log into paypal.  Under My Recent Activity, find your last payment to *eBay Inc Shipping* and click ""Details.""

Near the bottom of the page is a section with Funding Type.  Click Edit Funding Sources.  Change to a credit card.

**Why?**

* If you do this, you will have, for instance, all the shipping charges you are paid from customers as *cash for your business* for up to 30 days.  
* Similarly, you will have more time to pay your eBay fees.
* You get to feel like you're sticking it to eBay just a little bit.  :)
* By transferring PayPal to your bank so often, you will also be sure to have that cash ready.
* Finally, credit card rewards.  You can do your own research or, just do this:

 -If you can spend $1000 in 3 months, get the barclays arrival card. $400 bonus.

 -Or, if you can spend $3000 in 3 months, get the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card.  You'll get a $400 bonus, also.  [Here is a link explaining some nitty gritty of these two cards](http://creditcardforum.com/blog/barclaycard-arrival-world-mastercard-review/)

Nothing stops you from getting both of them.  If you only want to do one, my understanding is the Barclay's in the one to go with.

Note that each charges around $90 after 12 months, so cancel the cards before then.  

**Disclaimer**
I have great credit, and I think only once in my life did I let my credit card balance accrue interest.  If this does not describe you, maybe you shouldn't do this.  Be sure to pay down your balance each month.  (Keep in mind, you only need to pay your balance *since last statement* to avoid interest.. Your credit card should delineate this for you.)

Ebay,"Stolen iPhone bought on eBay, how to resolve?","My phone was stolen this past NYE in Tampa Florida while I was visiting.  There were a number of other objects stolen including another iPhone 5s and a Prada bag.  

It was turned offline, then sold on eBay to someone in Russia.  Since it was presumed stolen, I locked down the phone and sent a message to the phone detailing my work cell phone as a point of contact. 

I get a text message from a guy in Russia, asking me to unlock the phone etc..  We have been in dialogues over the past month or so trying to figure out how to handle this.  

I called the Tampa Police dept, who were less than thrilled I was wasting their time with such a small issue.  I don't think they would let me file a report.  

My Local police department will not allow me to file a report as the crime did not happen here.

Because I'm new to this and don't plan on selling on a regular basis I didn't have a return policy listed.

Ebay,Ebay account hacked - Ebay closes my account,"Hello everyone. I'm brand new here, but a friend suggested I come and tell my story. I'll keep this as brief as possible without leaving out the important details: 


Thursday evening I receive an e-mail from ebay telling me that, per my request, my e-mail address had been changed. ""The hell it has!"" I declared to no one in particular, and headed off to ebay (on my own, no clicking links from the email).


After logging in and seeing that my phone number and e-mail address had been changed (but not my password?), I changed it all back, changed my ID, and password. Check my Paypal (another password change), breathe a sigh of relief, and move on with my life.


Saturday I receive notification that my bid for an item I bought back in December has been canceled, and my account has been suspended for being linked to a ""restricted account"". Having only one account and being the only person that uses it, I let out many words that would make baby Jesus cry, and called ebay. They told me someone would investigate and to call back in 24 hours. 24 hours later, I'm told it's ""hard linked"" (no explanation of what that means), to give them another 24 hours, and I'll receive an email. 24 hours after *that*, they request *another* 24 hours, and offer another promise of an email. Today, day 4, I. Am. Pissed.


On the fourth day of my journey into madness, I make my fourth call, and speak to a nice guy. He asks what I've sold lately; I explain that I've sold a handful of times over my 12-ish years on ebay, and mostly just buy. He then asks repeatedly if I've faxed any proof of information to them. I let him know that none of the previous people who blew me off asked for anything beyond verbal confirmation of some details. He puts me on hold while he goes to speak to another unit. While he's gone, I notice this heartfelt email that had apparently arrived the night before. The meaty bit of it:


""We have determined that it is in our mutual best interest to part ways. We regret any frustration or inconvenience this matter may cause you.

For your account there is no appeal for this decision. From this point forward, in order to conduct business on the internet, you will have to find a different venue.""


So after three days and zero effort to verify who I am, they tell me to bend over. Before I'm able to tell the man about this rage-inducing e-mail, he lets me know that I need to fax in a few things to confirm my identity, and that they'll investigate once it's received. So the fax has now been sent, and that's where things currently sit.

Ebay,Question from an inexperienced seller.,"I sold an item on auction just over 3 days ago. The winning bidder has not paid yet and I have received no communication from them whatsoever. In my experience as a buyer I always paid for items as soon as I'd won the auction except on one occasion where I couldn't, however, I immediately contacted the seller to tell them I wouldn't be able to pay for another 48 hours.  

I notice I have the option to use a second chance offer. From what I understand this moves the sale to the next highest bidder. Am I entitled to use this option in my case, or is it bad policy? I know there's still a chance the winner of the bid could still pay but I'm skeptical as I have contacted them twice; once with an invoice and the second just an hour to ask if they are paying because it's getting close to the 4 day mark where I can raise a complaint.

Ebay,"Trouble with international buyer who bid/won on item listed as US ONLY, wants me to lie about value of item, etc. what to do?","OK, so I had an item end that said US ONLY BIDDERS etc. etc. in the auction, and some yahoo in the Netherlands bid and won it regardless.

Now, I admit that I didn't have the proper boxes checked in buyer restrictions, or whatever it is, because I had no idea they were even there, and the last time I sold on ebay years ago this crap didn't exist and stating it in the auction was good enough. Sure, you'd get questions to ship to Greece or whatever, and you'd ignore them or say 'no read the terms in the auction.'

So I send him a message saying 'sorry, need to cancel, no international shipping, stated clearly in auction.'

He refused to cancel and said 'well it didn't have a restriction in the auction' despite the content of the auction stating US ONLY.

He wants me to ship USPS international first class which, from my research, gives me no tracking or signature or protection at all for a very expensive LP. 

He also wants me to falsify the value on the customs forms so he 'doesn't pay the high VAT ' or whatever it is.

This reeks of a scam to me.

I don't know what do do next. 

Anyone know what might happen next? I am going to respond again saying that in the conditions in the auction it clearly stated that I will ship via a method that provides tracking and all sorts of insurance and confirmation, and that isn't what he wants, and that I'm not going to lie on the customs form which is against ebay policy and also I believe illegal!

If he agrees to my shipping terms I might send it, but still, this smells like dead fish to me, he even said 'send it to a friend in the US then for me.'

I opened a case and the seller is telling me the sent me what they said they did...basically that I'm a liar. I have no proof I was sent a used product besides my say so.

Ebay,About feedback,"Okay, so I'm mostly a buyer on eBay, though sometimes I sell. I really like buyers who gave feedback immediately and also ship within 24 hours. The things I buy I usually want as soon as possible and I actually check the tracking number 6+ times a day when I am buying something (usually one or two items every few months, I don't buy daily so getting packages is a big deal).

I love giving positive feedback to these guys but then I have users who wait 2 or more days before shipping (I recently had a guy wait much longer and it really irritated me). I also hate (really hate it) if a seller doesn't give feedback after I pay (I always pay immediately, even on auctions). The thing is, as long as the item is as described I don't feel like I have the right to just give them neutral or negative feedback even though that's what I want to do (neutral mainly, I've never met a seller who deserved negative feedback). I feel like a lot of people see neutral as negative feedback. 

Basically, is it okay to leave neutral feedback for these guys? Alternatively is there a method to ""tip"" the sellers who ship/feedback instantly? Like if I know a seller will ship within 24 hours and send feedback right after I pay, I don't even care if I have to pay 5-10$ more for the item, I will just have a lot more respect for the seller and would like to show that.",4,1,2014-02-20,EBAY,0.06023877486586571,0.9045068025588989,0.03525438532233238
Ebay,A guide on printing shipping labels for eBay using the Zebra LP 2844,"I made a guide because I had a horrible time setting everything up for an otherwise fantastic machine that lets me spend less time on my shipping process.

[Here is the link to see that guide.](http://exponentialslack.com/2014/02/zebra-lp-2844-for-ebay-paypal/)

Maybe you ask ""Why should I get a label printer like the LP 2844 when using my regular printer and just taping the labels to the box works just fine?"", so I'll tell you why:

1. It's fast. The label literally takes less than three seconds to print and put on the box. You don't have to mess around with cutting a label to size, and carefully putting multiple stripes of tape over the label.

2. It's cheap (kind of). The initial investment isn't a small one, the printer itself cost about $100 - 140 used or refurbished (if you keep an eye out on Craigslist you might be able to catch one for $70). It's cheap because after that initial investment, printing labels is basically free and you're not using any extra tape to adhere the label to the box. You can get free blank shipping labels from UPS.com. 

3. It's safe. Labels that are just taped over to the box can easily be torn off if something catches them at the right angle. To lose sticker labels you would basically have to rip all the cardboard off the side of the box. Additionally, you  don't have to worry about whether the post office will be able to scan the label because there is no tape covering the label.

Let me know if you find the guide useful. I'll be also making an Amazon shipping label printing guide once I figure it out.",15,11,2014-02-21,EBAY,0.02991277165710926,0.9281556010246277,0.04193169251084328

Ebay,HELP! Appealing Item Not Received Claim!,"Here's the story so far:

I bought an item from a seller. He/she sent it to me via priority mail with signature confirmation despite his listing as standard 1st class mail. I was not able to sign/receive it/pick it up from the post office as I was out of town. 

I contacted ebay about the situation so far, and let them know I was still interested in the item and would be happy to pay any additional fees. Ebay contacted the seller on my behalf. However, the seller became unresponsive and would not send the item back.

From here, I contacted Ebay by phone again. They told me to file a case that my item was not received. The seller still not answering my ebay messages, provided the tracking number of the item that showed it was sent back to him/her and NOT to my address, as I stated above that I was not able to receive it. 

I later called again and spoke to an Ebay representative that guaranteed me that in this situation, I should simply escalate the case and that the case would be ruled in my favor because I did not have the item.

2 hours later, Ebay closed the case and rule in the SELLERS favor. 

I'm at a loss at what to do?

Should I call Ebay again and ask them for guidance? Anyone have a similar experience or advice on what to do in this situation?

I recently bought (what I was deceived into believing) was a rare deck of these cards, only to receive them wrapped in a mylar bag and shipped media mail. The cards arrived in beat up condition because the seller is a cheap fuck. Luckily, USPS didn't call his bluff.

I bought an item, on Feb 10. Next day, Feb 11, it said electronic shipping info received and a tracking number was provided, three day shipping, to expect out around Feb 14.

They told me that someone bought, and scanned the label but it was never shipped.   Now to the etiquette question.  When do I file a claim?  Do I message the seller again?

3) I brought things from Amazon that were shipped in those padded bubble wrap envelopes. I used amazon boxes to ship my items but if I use a prepaid mailer it'll look really weird taping the opening. Should I just buy new ones?

4) How do you protect yourself from buyers (since I hear Ebay/Paypal sides with the buyer most of the time). The laptop I'm selling is completely blank with no operating system on it (I'm worried that the buyer won't read the description and then blame me when they're surprised that the laptop won't be useful without their own windows media).

Ebay,"Sold Gift Card, Paypal held funds after emailed code","Help me Redditors! I need your sagely eBay advice.

I am pretty sure I have been scammed at this point. I'm just hoping I can get my money back.
I sold a $25 gift card on eBay. The seller paid and contacted me asking me to message the code. I did so to avoid shipping costs for both of us, and I knew that this sort of thing was commonplace when selling gift cards. Furthermore, I read the eBay rule on gift cards, saying you could not sell codes. Since I sold the physical card but the buyer only requested the code, I saw no problem in sending it.

Several hours after I sent the code, Paypal withheld my funds. The buyer had opened an ""unauthorized claim.""
I provided 3 pictures, two screenshots of messages and one of the item.

Today, Paypal is telling me to open an eBay case, but I can't say I haven't received payment until 2 days after.

All in all, I feel like this guy just wanted to get a free gift card code and is claiming the transaction was ""unauthorized"" to get out of paying. Of course, his account could have been truly accessed by someone he did not know too. Both are possibilities. Either way, I'm left with a voided gift card that I cannot use or resell.

Ebay,Need Advice Regarding Inventory Tracking,"**TLDR: Went from 100-600/month to 3,000+. Need inventory tracking software since I will have to file taxes next year.**


I recently expanded the products that I sell in my eBay store and I am now making a consistant 2,000+ a month which will put me in the &gt;$10,000/year category.

Ebay,I am about 98% sure I got some reproduction DVDs...,"I bought four Disney DVDs from a seller as a lot - The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, Snow White, Aladdin - all Platinum Editions with slipcovers.

They came, first glance: Beautiful!  Shiny and great shape.
Taking them all out to test-drive them in the DVD player: None of the slipcovers look wary...except on Cinderella, the mice's faces look incredibly terrifying.  All of them out of the slipcover, the DVD cover arts all seem to have coloration issues of some sort.  And Cinderella still has creepy mice.  So I do a Google image search to see if it's just because the eyes are so small that it ends up looking creepy but find that on other cover arts, they look like the normal, sweet mice we have all come to love.  And Snow White's cover art looks like a ten year old printed it off the internet on high quality paper.  It's a bit off center and not the same size as standard DVD cover art (whatever that size is).  And the color strip that says ""Platinum Edition"" on the cover art is a weird blueish/purpleish color and when you compare it to image search, it should be silvery-grey.  

It was most noticeable, though, with The Little Mermaid as I already owned it on DVD (figured this new duplicate could be a birthday gift) and so I was able to side by side compare them.  The cover art coloration is definitely off.  The case inside is different; the one I already owned had the DVD menu papers on the left with the two DVDs on the right vs. the new one had disc one on the left and disc two on the right with the menu slip in the middle in little teeth things in the middle part of the DVD case.  The coloration of the artwork on the DVDs just purchased were far more saturated than that of the one I already owned.

All that said, I'm not necessarily unhappy in the sense that I want to return them; they are for the most part well done and most importantly - they all work.  But I am unhappy with the fact that these are most likely knockoffs being sold as factory new and I ended up paying 50 bucks on DVDs this person prints in his/her basement/attic/living room/spare bedroom.  (And this seller sells a LOT of these lots.  A LOT.)

Is there anything else that could be done?  I've heard of partial refunds; would that be something to look into?  Is that a douchebag move?  (To which if you said yes, my follow up question would be ""isn't selling ""factory new"" Disney DVDs to an unknowing public also a douchebag move?)

TL;DR I bought four ""factory new"" Disney DVDs for 50 bucks from a seller and am 98% sure they're really well done, working fakes.

Ebay,Seller demanding more money for shipping - what to do?,"I just purchased a fairly expensive, very heavy item on Ebay. I paid the exact cost that Ebay asked for (~$40) but now the seller is saying it's going to cost a total of $70 to ship so I owe him the difference ($30).

As far as I know - I am within my rights to tell him to shove it and eat the cost himself. But I am concerned that if I do that he'll just cancel the auction and not ship me the item. I got a decent price on it, so I would like him to ship me the item...

I proposed a solution to him of me splitting the difference. I am fairly sure I don't owe him anything - but I'm trying to make sure this ends amicably.

What do you all think?",9,4,2014-02-28,EBAY,0.02706235833466053,0.9120890498161316,0.060848601162433624
Ebay,Complicated situation..not sure how to handle it.,"I was selling a lot of 4 Atari 800's and guy 1 won the auction at $40. I sent the invoice and he didn't pay for four days. I got a message saying ""Use Ebay's Second Chance option!"" so I figured, okay cool I can actually can paid and uncrowd my house with these. Guy 2 happily said yes and sent the funds. While I was packing a key fell off so I messaged guy 2 and let him know and he was okay with it. It was all packed and ready to go today after 6 days from the original auction when Guy 1 suddenly sent the payment. I messaged him and tried to cancel and I also refunded the funds on paypal but he went on about how the bid was a contract to allow him to purchase it. So I sent him a message and told him that the key fell off and that if he is okay with that I will gladly send it to him first. At the same time I messaged Guy 2 asking him kindly to please just let the order be cancelled and I apoligize greatly and I'll send him a free Sega Saturn. Neither have responded so right now I'm paranoid I'll have to people wanting 4 Atari's and refusing to cancel.",3,3,2014-02-28,EBAY,0.04428757354617119,0.9069067239761353,0.048805661499500275
Ebay,"Case opened against me, little paranoid.","I sold an iPhone to a buyer who received it and then promptly opened a case against me. Apparently iOS 7 added a feature I was unaware of that links your iTunes account to your phone. Well I opted to refund him the money if he sent the phone back and he said that if I wiped the iTunes account from the phone and sent it back, he'd drop the case. 

My paranoia is that he can get the phone, have it work, and then not drop the case as it shows that I have received the phone and is awaiting me to issue the refund. All of our communication has been through eBay thus far, is there any chance of this happening? I've never had a case against me before. 

EDIT: Would also like to add I have sent the phone back to him and tracking has confirmed that it has been delivered. 

EDIT2: Contacted eBay, they said they've noted the actions I've taken and will rule in my favor when the claim escalates in two days. Will keep you posted as things happen. 

EDIT3: eBay managed to contact the buyer via phonecall and the case was dropped. Thanks everybody!",7,3,2014-02-28,EBAY,0.04868018254637718,0.9105021357536316,0.04081766679883003
Ebay,Odd request to buy only part of an item from eBay?,"I am trying to buy a make-up palette from a eBay seller, but the problem is her listing is a 3 item bundle (make-up palette/ make-up brush/ BB cream) and I am only interested in 1 of those 3 items. I have contacted the seller about buying just that one item from her for a lower price, and she agreed to my offer, but we both don't know how to go about doing this. I have thought about doing this just through Paypal, but on second thought it seemed a bit risky. I have also thought about telling her to create a new listing at a BIN price, but her response time to my messages is typically 24 hours, and I am afraid that by the time she responds back and lists the item, someone else would have bought it already. Can someone please shed some light to this odd situation? Thanks!",1,2,2014-02-28,EBAY,0.10533346980810165,0.8590341210365295,0.03563239052891731
Ebay,Should I ask for a partial refund?,"I bought a dress on 2/17 (estimated arrival date: 2/21). On 2/25, I noticed that it hadn't even shipped yet, so I message the seller. She responded back today (2/27) that she hadn't noticed that it had sold and would send it soon.

Am I justified in asking for a partial refund, since it's taken her so long to ship?",13,2,2014-02-28,EBAY,0.06531692296266556,0.8751798272132874,0.05950328707695007
Ebay,USPS Problem: Stuck at Sort Facility,"I bought an item from a guy, The tracking shows that it was first processed through the Jersey City Sort Facility on Febuary 22, was re-processed on the 25th (was supported to receive item on the 24th).  No information since then.  I submitted a case with the ""Customer Service"", was told i'd receive a response within ""24-48 hours"".  It's been over that now, they haven't gotten back to me.
