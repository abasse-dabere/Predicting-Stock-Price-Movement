Ebay,Views on ebay tanked. Went from 70+ views on worst items to 5-10 over 30 day period (about 2 month ago). What gives,"I'm in jewelry, and views have tanked. I have a store of about 40 items currently that I update as an item sells, so usually stays around that amount. I noticed that when I relisted my best rings, for some reason they went from doing very well (for my standards) as 300+ viewers with 10-15 watchers to 50-100 views and few watchers over a 30 day period.

This carried over to last month when I relisted it. Some of my items aren't even breaking 10 views a month when before they could get close to 100. I've done nothing different whatsoever. I updated shipping policies per the spring seller update. It was actually around that time that my views seemed to tank. I was doing great before.


What changed, how can I fix this. I started using lightroom to improve the pictures on my rings, I thought maybe more competition had entered the market and I needed nicer pictures. But it's not done much. I must be way down in the search results compared to before but I do not know why.

If anyone has any insight, I would really appreciate it.",31,51,2018-07-01,EBAY,0.019055696204304695,0.9043012857437134,0.07664299011230469

Ebay,A buyer shipped an item they bought from me overseas. Now it's broken. Am I liable?,"A buyer on Ebay bought a computer monitor from me. I packed it in bubble wrap and sent it to them. I watched the tracking number, and it was delivered a week ago.   
   
Now, a week later, the buyer requests a refund. He claims that the monitor (which he has shipped overseas now) is broken, and has provided a picture of the shattered screen.  
   
If it was broken when he received it and he let me know right away, I would have given him his refund and filed a claim with the post office for damage during shipping. But in these circumstances, I feel like my responsibility for the item ended when he received it and didn't contact me at that point, and does not extend to whatever amount of time he had it in his possession for, a trans-Atlantic shipping voyage, or use by whatever third recipient he was sending it to.  
   
Ebay is not giving me any option to dispute this refund request, which I feel is not valid given the circumstances. The only option is to message the buyer, who doesn't seem to be giving in. Is there any way I can make this case to Ebay and get this thrown out or is it just a matter of time before they take the money from me and I get a negative review?

Ebay,Requesting return after buyer broke item,"The 5mm lens that I had sold to this buyer had stayed in its lens protective case since long after her passing. When I had first sold the item to a previous buyer, I had made certain to test it out first to ensure there were no imperfections or damages of any kind, and there were not, I was able to attach it to her own camera, focus the lens very smoothly (as there was still oil inside of the aperture), the picture through the view finder was clean as a whistle. The first buyer had requested a refund and had been fully reimbursed, his reasonings all documentable through eBay, involved the minuscule scratches, unseeable to the naked eye on the front optic, something I would’ve only seen had I shined a bright light through one end of the disassembled lens through the other. when the item returned it was in the exact same shape it was shipped in, and during the time of its return, I had purchased film for the camera online, and was able to get crystal clear DEVELOPED results. The current buyer states, by his photos he provided me, that the mounting region of the lens is completely broken meaning there is no chance of it mounting, and then proceeds to outline a massive scratch on the outside of the metal, a deep one at that, which leads me to believe he was trying to take the lens apart to replace or repair the scratches on the front optic, but couldn’t get it open. There is simply no other way a cut that deep could come from any kind of average use. His return request came 9 days after he confirmed it was delivered and my funds were deposited, which increases my suspicion that he was unable to achieve what he was out to do originally with the lens. I am infuriated not only because it’s my grandmothers lens, but because if this lens is returned and refunded it will be rendered virtually useless to me both efficiently and financially. The mounting bracket to the lens, which in the photo he sent me looks absolutely destroyed, either he was trying to fit it on a camera that wouldn’t fit it, or an adapter that wasn’t correct as this is an extremely old lens, if he agrees to fix this I will offer him a full refund, the camera will not work without this and he will be returning an item that originally had functioned. I know when I am in obligation to accept a return and refund a buyer, but in this case I do not believe I am. I got an email saying the dispute had been transferred to a claim under Paypal and I wrote similarly as I did here when I had been asked on Paypal’s site. I’m confused what he did here, what’s the difference? and what are my chances are having to refund this guy and then spend the money to repair the most important piece of the lens. He doesn’t speak English so I didn’t get much out of him regarding the kinds of damage the item had sustained outside of the pictures.

Ebay,Very confused about a case that was opened against me. Hoping for a little info on the situation.,"So I recently sold an item on ebay, the buyer received it and I thought all was well. About a week later the buyer decided to open a return against me stating that the item was defective and did not work. I know for a fact this is bullshit, The item was tested before shipped and i know for a fact that it worked 100%  perfectly when it was shipped. From the messages it is clear that the buyer had no clue how to use the item and just wants to return it for that reason.

I agreed to the return, I figured it would be easier than dealing with this person. After I agree to the return they buyer opens a claim against me for whatever reason. Well he messaged me the tracking number for the return, but failed to add it to the claim, so the claim was closed. On ebay it says that the claim was ruled in his favor, but I have gotten my money back and I will be receiving the returned item tomorrow. So it seems like it was ruled in my favor.

I don't feel right keeping the money and the item, but I think its bullshit that the buyer made me go through all of this for something I know works perfectly. Would it be alright to just reject the package at the post office and have it be shipped back to the buyer?

I apologize for the wall of text, I'm just a bit annoyed and hoping someone could give me some advice on what to do.

Edit: I forgot to add that I'm also afraid that the guy may have broken the item after receiving it and that's why he is sending it back, or he could be trying to scam me by returning a different item.

Edit: yep the I got the item and the circuit board is fried which is not the way I sent it. So the buyer isn't getting shit back.",39,14,2018-07-05,EBAY,0.21617960929870605,0.7483783960342407,0.03544194996356964

Today is the estimated delivery date. I assume on the 7th I can ask ebay to refund me? I am concerned he will ship my game today and I'll be waiting another week just to get an empty package in the mail.  Which concerns me as I've heard ebay wanting police reports and the like.

Ebay,"A Lesson in eBay Policy: Shipped out Boosted Board to buyer, got returned old skateboard, eBay refunds buyer $985","**\[UPDATES BELOW\]** So I decided to sell my old Boosted Board electronic longboard on eBay. Some dude bought it quick. Now this guy was fishy from the start, asking me to take the transaction off eBay to INSTAGRAM all of things in the beginning. I should've just found another seller. But I wanted to get rid of the board and get the $ fast so I went through with it like an idiot. When he sent me $985 on PayPal I thought everything would be cool so I shipped the board out, and it's all downhill from there...

[Sent out this: Boosted Board V2 Dual+ Plus Electric Skateboard](https://i.redd.it/tj56ckhykl811.jpg)

Guy messages me the next week saying, ""Hey. You really did a horrible job packaging. Because of you the whole board is broken, doesn't even turn on. I'm gonna need a refund,"" and slowly becomes more of a know-it-all as the discourse progresses. I thought his claim was bs. Board was sent in the original Boosted packaging just as it was sent to me and the thing is nearly indestructible package or not. I could've just slapped a shipping label on the board itself, popped it in the mailbox, and it would've been fine when it reached him. I didn't buy his claim. So I looked through his reviews to see if he was a scam artist and sure enough another seller had posted ""SCAMMER, BEWARE"" on his account. I messaged this buyer and he let me know that indeed this buyer had purchased an item from him, said it was damaged and then proceeded to return a completely different item. eBay seemed to be just fine with this as they allowed the buyer to keep using eBay and seem to only allow positive reviews on his account right now. (""Scammer, Beware"" was listed under the positive reviews making it hard for eBay to find when I informed them about it, and after this whole debacle when I myself tried to list a negative review I was not given the option, only Positive or Report Buyer, a flaw about which eBay could not give me an answer.)

So even though the transaction had clearly stated ""No Returns Accepted,"" eBay says that I HAVE to accept this return by policy, but with the slight condolence (read: lie) that they would help me if my suspicions were confirmed. Cut forward one week and the package is returned to me. I open it up to find.....

[This thing.](https://i.redd.it/s9lp24f8ll811.jpg)

I was thinking maybe he'd return a different damaged Boosted Board to me. Boy was I wrong. I get this  old skateboard, all peripherals and electronics stolen. Even the Boosted stickers... So when I see this I'm thinking, ""Oh lolz this will be easy. I won't really have to prove much at all to show eBay he's a scammer and I'll get to keep the money. No refund."" Boy was I wrong again. eBay says they need a lot of time for arbitration.

So I'm thinking what proof do I have that this dinky skateboard was actually sent to me and I didn't throw it in there myself when the package came (This is what eBay is thinking at this point. We can't prove that he's the scammer and I'm not.) So I look around the package a bit and I find that one of the return shipping label says the entire package was only 12 pounds in transit. Boosted Board alone weighs 15 pounds. The package I sent out was over 22 pounds with all the peripherals. AKA there is no possible way a Boosted Board was sent back to me unless it was cut in half.

eBay still doesn't buy it. They side with the buyer, take the $985 out of my PayPal and return it to the buyer. Then goes countless hour-long phone calls to eBay, something like, ""I sent you a photo that clearly states that the package was only 12 pounds when I got it. The Boosted weighs 15 and you're telling me that I haven't sufficiently proven that I did not receive the original item. And you're going to give him the money back when I clearly do not have the board!"" I eventually  ask one of the eBay representatives, ""Does that make sense to you?!"" to which the rep replies, ""Well... No... It does not really make sense... But this is all we can do for you right now... Or you can try messaging the buyer yourself and try to resolve it with him."" eBay thinks I can form a resolution with a scammer? Not sure how this would work? Needless to say, I've had no communication returned from him since eBay pulled the money from me.

SO MY QUESTION IS: What do I do now (besides vent on Reddit)? Any pro-eBayers around? Other subreddits where this may be good to post?

**UPDATE 1:** Thank you for all of the advice, bigger response than expected. Beyond on the initial talking I did with eBay and the buyer, so far today I have filed IC3 and US Postal Inspection Service complaints online. I have emailed Boosted asking for tracking possibilities and/or reporting the board as a stolen item. And I have left not happy posts on eBay's Facebook and Twitter. Tomorrow I plan on working the PayPal route to see if they can help before I step up to litigation and/or the use of ""termites"" as some have suggested.

**UPDATE 2 (7.8.18):** Filed a report with the BBB against eBay today. Commenters on other subreddits are suggesting I make a YouTube video out of this process. Any interest in that? Seems like a lot of work.

**UPDATE 3 (7.12.18):** BBB notified eBay of the complaint and just a few days later, I'm pleased to say **eBay has come through!** eBay stated they will issue a full refund including fees and has apologized for the confusion and dissatisfying interactions with customer service. The hours of calling and talking to reps, supervisors, appeals department and fraud department did nothing for my case and it seems all involved had their responses predetermined due to policy and procedure. One BBB complaint and I get a message from ""eBay's Office of the President,"" clearing it all up. No police report necessary.

Ebay,Won an auction with GSP (£30) now seller asks £193 for shipping.,"First of all, sorry if a make grammar mistakes but English is not my native language. 

Last week i won an auction for an used iMac 21.5 Late 2015 for £410 + £30 of shipping to Spain from UK (Shipping is included in the eBay global shipping program and it's calculated automatically). The ad / auction had photos of the iMac, its serial number, login screen with user's name, etc... nothing rare. The seller has 0 positive feedback as seller, and only 2 positive votes as buyer. 

A few days after winning the auction i contacted the seller and asked if he had the original box and how he would send the package. He replied that he haven't the OG Box and the shipment would be £193. I replied that I would not pay him that money, and paid £440.  


Now i don't know what to think, its a scam? does the seller knows what GSP is? he expected more money for its iMac and don' want to send it?

Ebay,"Buyers dog eats my property, Ebay gives him my money.","I'm so done with Ebay. They could not care less about sellers.

I list a mint condition collectable watch fo auction, lots of interest, I answer everyone's questions, all goes well and I get a good price.

I send off the item registered shipping as agree first thing next morning.

Buyer contacts me a few days later to say that he feels the watch is not his style. I allow returns on my items because some people make claims about damage when they want to return items and I would rather they just ve honest, very few people change minds but sometimes it happens.

I'm proud of my hundreds of watch sales and never a negative feedback, 3 years on ebay and I am still 100% rated.

I agree to refund watch if returned, but not cost of shipping because seller just changed his mind. Seller agrees.

Seller ships watch, and mentions ""by the way, my dog ate the brand new strap you placed on watch, I replaced with one of my old used items"".

I'm not happy but the watch is the important thing.

Watch arrives, I agree to refund item cost minus shipping but Ebay only allows full refund of item cost AND shipping. I escalate the issue to Ebay and they advise paying buyer on Paypal directly and they will cancel return.

Before we can work this out Ebay pays my money from Paypal account to buyer for item cost and shipping.

TL;DR: Buyer changed his mind about buyer a watch returned it after his dog ate the brand new leather strap I hand fitted for him at his request, then ebay gave him a full refund plus cost of shipping even after he agreed he should pay shipping.",27,57,2018-07-09,EBAY,0.032739751040935516,0.9306851029396057,0.03657516464591026

I sold two items recently. For the first item, my buyer was charged 10$ less than what I then had to pay. After fees and everything, I made 5$ on a 20$ item. On the second item, I had to pay 20$ out of pocket for shipping, and barely made 60$ on a 100$ item. At this rate it's not worth my time and I pulled a bunch of listing off. I'll just try and sell them locally instead.

I have 375 current listings (about to put up another 50 or so) but with eBay fees and no sales I'm questioning whether it's worth it or not.

Ebay,Buyer is threatening to report her card as stolen over a return. What can I do to protect myself?,"Hello everyone, I'm a bit at wits end over this return.

About a month ago, a customer buys a medium priced item from me ($50 plus shipping) and a few weeks later she messages me just saying that it didn't work for what she needed it for and she didn't need it anymore. I tell her no problem, please open a return and return it.

She opens a ""INAD"" return, instead of a normal return so she doesn't have to pay for return shipping. Whatever. It's fine. Annoying, but fine. I purchase the label and send it to her.

A few days go by and she strings me this story about how she doesn't own a car and can't return it and how she just wants a refund. I tell her politely *""sorry, but no""*. I'm not giving her the item for free. She says she will ask a friend for a ride and go to the post office and how she'd rather use her own label than use the one I paid for her. I told her just to use my label, she refuses and says she already sent it. I ask her for the tracking number, and crickets.

A few days pass and she says *""when am I getting my refund""* I tell her again *""please send me the tracking number, and I will refund you as soon as it delivers.""* no response again for about 2 weeks when eBay automatically closes the return, it gets escalated and I get another message from eBay saying this today: *""\[insert name here\] indicated that they posted their return. The item should now be delivered and once you've received it, please issue the buyer with a refund by Jul 11, 2018.""*

That is followed by a message where she attacks me for being a scammer, and how the item should be there by now, but I'm refusing to refund her blah blah blah...

I respond nicely, again, just send me the tracking number so I can see when it will arrive. She responds with this:

*""I did my part. I shipped it back to you and you received it. I have the tracking number that proves it! It shows delivered, but you won't give me my money back. I lost so much money shipping it back to you, it wasn't even worth it. It was your job to pay the return shipping, and you did not! I'm filing a dispute with my bank saying I had my card stolen, and you'll suffer the consequences.""*

1. I asked her many times to send it to me. If she did send it back, she refuses to prove it to me
2. She chose to ship it her self. I paid for the label, and she chose not to use it.
3. She literally admits that she's  about to commit fraud.

I'm at a loss. What do I do with this situation. My suspicion is she just wants a refund and to keep the item too. My friends say I shouldn't even respond any more, but I don't want her to report the card stolen and it be a whole ordeal. Is there anything I can do to protect myself from that? Call eBay, Paypal? Would they even be able to do anything?

**TL;DR:** A customer refused to use my label to ship a return back, and refuses to share the tracking information for the return at all despite telling me it's showing as delivered. After some back and forth she's threatening to report her card stolen.

Any advice would be really helpful...


UPDATE:
I just got off the phone with eBay, and they closed the case in my favor and our a block on her opening any other cases. They recommend to not contact her any more and they believe she has not actually sent it back and is looking for a full refund and to keep the item.

I declined because I didn't want to pay for shipping again to ship the item to a new customer.

A few days later I get a message from the buyer telling me that he shipped the item back and wants a full refund on his card.

Ebay,Buyer claims my sealed box came open and wants money off,"I sold an item that was brand new sealed. My auction photos show the factory sticker intact and I'm positive I sent it fully sealed, no rips or tears. A week goes by after the delivery and now the buyer claims that the bottom of the box came ripped open (ever so slightly, I asked for a picture of what they are claiming). https://imgur.com/a/PqblGdn

I sent the box within another box so it couldn't have been damaged like that during shipping unless USPS opened it and did that. Unfortunately my photos don't show the bottom of the box in the listing nor did I take any since I didn't see any value in taking a picture of that. The item sold for $210 and they want $50 off since it's been ""opened.""

Ebay,Why does ebay think ostriches are endangered?,"So my g/f ended up getting her account suspended for 3 days. 

She calls them and asks why it was suspended, they tell her because she listed a decorative ostrich egg and that ""ostriches are endangered so not permitted to sell any ostrich items."" 

She tried to point out to them that: 

1. The egg (shell only) originated from an ostrich farm (we believe).   

2. Ostriches are not endangered.  They are listed as ""least concern"" in regards to conservation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ostrich

3. There are currently 150 similar items (mostly eggs) https://imgur.com/a/hUewcgg on eBay. 

4. There are over 177,000 various ostrich derived items on ebay 

She asked why her egg wasn't allowed but all of this stuff were, and the rep said : 

""Those auctions haven't been reported/removed yet""

Ebay,"Review Dispute, Looking For Advice","Hey,

So the other day I noticed my first negative review on an item I sold. The complaint was that the item was flawed, but that flaw was described EXACTLY in the condition description of the item. The one thing that I may have done wrong is list the condition as good, even though according to eBay's ""what is Good, Acceptable, etc for this type of item"" section, it's not. This wasn't to mislead anyone, but because I didn't bother to as I didn't think anyone cared about that rating system, and I didn't see other sellers using it. Since the condition description appears RIGHT NEXT TO the condition type, you can't miss it.

I sent him a message explaining that I described the item's condition exactly the way he had complained about it,  and asked if I could send him a link to remove the review (I doubt he would change it to positive). 

What else can I do if he doesn't respond? Is there any hope in hell that eBay will remove the review if I show them the listing? I probably can't offer him a refund, as that would be extortion?

Ebay,Fun Return Case,"Here is what happened in order:

1. Buyers makes a purchase and immediately pays me.

2. A few minutes later she states. ""Oh whoops please send it to this other address."" I nope out and submit a cancellation based off an ""issue with buyers address.""

3. Somehow...and I'm still confused about this..she updates her address on paypal and submits another payment through ebay. On ebay it says the purchase was cancelled but it has a corresponding paypal payment.

4. At this point I could not cancel out of this and think mistakes happen. I package it up and send it to her PO address.

5. It arrives and sits at the post office or some other location for a week before they pick it up. they immediately start blasting my inbox stating the item is damaged, poorly packaged, etc. To me it was packaged fine but I thought maybe the post office dropped it. I asked for photos.

6. A few hours later she submits the photos. It look like the pictures were taken from a potato. Furthermore it did not event look my item or packaging. She also did not take a picture of any damaged.

7. I stated she needs to go through ebay to submit a return. She was belligerent and wanted me to refund her through Paypal and she would send it back on her own. I told her no she needs to talk to ebay if she has issues figuring out how to return it.

8. She calls ebay supposedly and they state she can't return it due to the original cancellation. I called them up and they said that isn't true and that they need to be reported. 

9. She then opens up a paypal case instead and is refusing to submit pictures or documentation on the damages.

Ebay,NEED ADVICE: Ebay return problem. Buyer initiated return then opened a review case days later.,"Hey all,

Sold a pair of $200 shoes to someone on ebay. Upon receiving them, the buyer messaged me very angrily, claiming that they are fake. To the best of my knowledge, they are not. Anyway.. First he messaged and requested a partial refund. Almost immediately after, he said ""nevermind, I want all my money back."" However regardless of my ""no return policy"" on ebay, I told him that he could initiate a return and I'd refund 100% upon receiving them in the same condition that they were sent. He said ""I will be forced to start a case"" even after I said that. I simply sent the initiate return link to him in response. He initiated the return, using a claim that the item does not seem authentic. I bought an ebay shipping label for him and waited for them to be sent back. They needed to be shipped by the 17th for the return to close; however today he opened a dispute case with ebay for some reason. The only difference now is that instead of me having the ability to press a button which refunds the buyer, ebay reviewed the case and decided that he will be refunded immediately upon tracking showing that the item was delivered. Why would this happen? I'm getting sketched out and am scared that I'm going to recieve a box of rocks and be out by 200 bucks. Is there anything I can do?

Thanks guys.",6,4,2018-07-16,EBAY,0.04894053936004639,0.9004487991333008,0.05061061307787895

Ebay,"Bought a seller refurbished PS4 but, the seller removed the item from listing after I paid","Hello, everyone. I should preface this all with saying that this is my first purchase from Ebay ever.


As the title says, I saw a seller refurbished PS4 for 80 USD and thought to myself that it seemed to good to be true. The seller has good reviews (98%+ are positive), has 60 day returns and would pay for return shipping if need be. What worried me was that the picture of the PS4 was a stock photo and not an actual picture of an existing one but, seeing as how Ebay constantly places their buyer protection insurance in your face so you wouldn’t be afraid to buy something, I caved in. Before paying I noticed that it informed me that it may take from July 27th to September 17 or something to **ship**, which would be a while but I’d be willing to wait that long for that price. 


After I paid, I checked my purchases after like half an hour and saw that it said “PAID (Item Removed)” on my only purchase in this list. I think that’s strange and would like to know from more experienced ebay buyers or sellers on what my course of action should be.


I’d appreciate anything you guys can tell me and will answer questions.

UPDATE: After sending an email to customer support, they’ve told me that they were the ones that removed the item from listing since it broke some policies and they also seem to have taken action against the seller’s account at the same time.

Ebay,Looking for advice on refund to buyer for lost package,"Backstory: I shipped an item to a buyer on July 3. It was supposed to be delivered by July 6, but the tracking shows that it hasn't moved from my local post office since July 4. After several phone calls to the post office, I've been told that the package is lost and that I should file a claim. Meanwhile my buyer is (understandably) getting impatient and wants a refund.

My questions are:

1) Should I just send him a refund or should I first ask him to submit a refund request through eBay? Will either affect my account negatively?

2) What happens if I refund him, then USPS finds the package and he receives it? Do I have any recourse through eBay to get my refund back? Would how I process his refund change this?

They said its a civil matter or an EBAY matter and EBAY is just passing the blame on so they dont have to do anything basically.

Its too easy to buy something and either not send the item back, or send another similar item that is broke. I wont sell valuables in lots anymore after this and the worst thing....the buyer left this feedback ""In 20 yrs of eBay one of the most dishonest sellers ever dealt with""


Im a veteran seller who for the most part knows how to avoid scams by buyers. 

I sold a lot of 5 DUNGEONS and DRAGONS toys. I sold for $300.00. Buyer got item and said two of the figures bubbles came unglued during shipping. Ive seen this happen with old toys before so I said ship everything back and I will refund and pay for the label. Im not disputing the items were damaged during shipping. 

He didnt seem to want to do that, he wanted to only ship back the damaged figures and keep another figure and two books.

I called EBAY before accepting the return  and they said I was right. I approved the return. I went to the post office and signed for the return and immediately I knew he only sent back the two figures.

I didnt open the box and called EBAY. First woman told me to not open the box and GO TO THE POLICE STATION????? and file a report. I think she was confused. Anyway she said shed keep the case open for 5 days while I go to the police. I was excited to go to see the look on their faces when I would ask them to file a report. 

Anyway about 10 minutes later THE CASE IS CLOSED IN THE BUYERS FAVOR, THEY GET THE FULL $300.00 back. Wait what??? I just talked to CAROLYN at EBAY. 

So I have to call again and wait 25 minutes to get to JANE. Jane tells me now to OPEN THE BOX, TAKE PICTURES, and she sends me a link to upload the files. She says she will call me the next day. 

She calls and tells me basically that she now has to message the buyer and he has to admit he only shipped back two items. I tell her, so IM SCREWED, she says let her email the buyer. Get this, she says if the buyer never responds....EBAY WILL JUDGE IN HIS FAVOR. So the buyer has to not respond and gets to keep his $300.00 and keep 3 items for free. THERES GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY. Why even bother to ask me to take pictures. Ebay is going to favor the buyer 94% of the time. 

So I will hear back from her in 48 hours or less. We all know the outcome here....IM GOING TO LOSE. His word against mine, and he has perfect feedback, but that doesnt really mean anything, it just means hes a veteran at knowing how to scam sellers. 

 EBAY just doesnt get it. They have to come up with a better process so the seller doesnt get scammed. My story is small potatoes to some of you IPHONE sellers. 

My one out here is I insured the package. 

Theres got to be some kind of process. Id like to see EBAY team up with FED EX or the post office for returns where they can open the return at the post office or fedex and can confirm the contents. 

I for the most part dont get scammed, because I use signature confirmation. Also if the item is broke, I always make them send it back because I insure it. I never give partial refunds. So many times people have tried to scam me for some partial refund, when I tell them to send it back, they all of a sudden say ""oh, Ive decided to keep it"". You've got to stand firm with some of these buyers. 

After this though, I wont be selling in BULK lots any more (unless its cheap stuff), I will sell it ONE BY ONE. I have a HUGE collection of MAGIC cards and wanted to sell them all in one lot, but I know someone will buy it, take out the good cards, and ship back the rest. SO I have to sell the cards ONE BY ONE.

Ebay,My competitors sell lower quality products for much higher prices at a greater frequency. Why?,"There is a sizeable market for refurbished off-lease business laptops. I own an authorized computer repair center and am continuously surprised why our units see far less sales than many competitors on eBay.

Go search for a refurbished laptop on eBay. Many of the top listings will turn up a stock product photo of the model when it was new. If you read the description, these units are actually in various conditions. Most times that I've ordered from a listing like this, cosmetic wear is fairly significant, batteries barely hold a charge, etc. For many of the larger shops, ""refurbished"" simply means they ran a few hardware tests and everything passed within their own arbitrary parameters of what's acceptable. 

For our sales, we only purchase units to refurbish if they are in excellent or like new cosmetic condition. For each and every unit, we take photos with a DLSR from all angles to ensure a customer knows exactly what they're getting. We also tend to refurbish our models with better parts (i.e. 8GB RAM instead of 4GB, new batteries, etc) and include warranties as well. Even with these additions, our advertised pricing is typically at or below most competitor prices on comparable models.  

For some reason, our sales volume still lacks in comparison. Can someone elucidate what might be going on here? We're TRSP with 99.6% feedback(ten months since our last negative). We've tried using stock images like the other sellers, but even with our units being some of the best looking examples on the platform, our ""not as described"" return rate skyrocketed.

edit- further, I can only assume buyers who purchase these stock photo listings think they are getting units that look cosmetically new, but this is rarely the case. I wish I knew return rates for these other sellers.",10,4,2018-07-19,EBAY,0.03209022432565689,0.9291080236434937,0.038801707327365875

Ebay,Did my seller just charge me a 50% refund fee?,"So I made a purchase yesterday, after the Primo coupon and a couple of ebay bucks my purchase total came down from $90 to $76 total. Shortly after making my purchase, I realized that I didn't update my banking info to the new account and card I activated a few weeks back. Since Paypal won't let me change payment options after making a purchase, I decided to simply cancel my order so I may try again another time after I linked my new bank account to Paypal.

Well, was I in for a shock when I got back from work today. My $76 were refunded, but I logged in to the old bank account and found right below it was a $48 charge in ""other charges"" by the same source that refunded me. Nothing of this is listed on my Paypal account, nor on the ebay details.

Ebay,Be warned. Android Ebay app issues.,"I have listed many things on ebay and know the app like the back of my hand, so I am well aware that I did nothing to initiate this but the following has happened:

I set custom postage fees under two separate services. I enabled local pick up but **not** click and collect. What happened? The moment I hit enter Ebay posts my listing (be mindful I checked Preview before submitting) and it clears my custom postage charges and sets them at their undervalued, default values, meaning when I sell the item I have to dip into MY pocket to cover the excess (an no, it isn't about how little it is, it is about principle) and then it enabled click and collect!! What the actual F? I never even went anywhere near that option! Is this some kind of funky default that gets enabled under something else? Good grief!

This is a very severe issue with this app because I am **100% certain** that I did not reset my own custom postage charges and I did not enable click and connect.

Some clown bids 10 minutes later on something I have only just listed even though it has an auction duration of ten days. Now I can't edit the delivery and charges.

Thanks Ebay.

Looks like I will be sticking to the PC browser based version. Absolute shocker.

Can I call Ebay and get this changed or do I have to relist it because of ebay app developer incompetence?



EDIT: Okay so I made peace with the fee thing... sort of had no choice, simply put. However last night, after discovering Click &amp; Collect had magically enabled itself, I decided to give Ebay a call today. I did say I was meticulous when listing my item, sure enough I HAD NOT enabled Click &amp; Collect, but Ebay UK (through their app or via web page) have started enabling Click &amp; Collect by DEFAULT!

Ebay,Story time,"This is so classic eBay but I'm not even surprised or angry at this point.
So I'm not new to eBay but created a new account recently to sell certain products.

Anyways I try to list an item on Monday. Get a technical error message ... try again the next night- same thing. Try again Wednesday still wouldn't let me list so I finally gave in and called them. 

Between being on hold and waiting for a representative i was waiting a solid half hour. By the time the rep got back to me we were on the phone for another half hour at least.

To his credit he was very nice and did a great job in that regard, but for reasons unknown the problem couldn't be solved. He basically said he has no idea why I'm getting the error messages. Tried a few things but nothing worked. In the end he said he'll send a report out to the technical department but it could take days, so he suggested since the account was brand new to perhaps just create a new one with a different emAil.

So I created a new one. Not the end of the world only took about fifteen minutes to get set up and list 5 items. This is where the story gets interesting though .

Within twenty minutes the new account gets suspended and all listings removed . So I called them back and explained , this time had a generic rep who was spewing out stuff either that I already knew or was just pure nonsense. Anyways in the end he lifted the suspension and said everything is back to normal. It was supposebaly due to verification or soemthing but he said since I verified who I am on the phone it is all fine. 

The account was up again so I decided to list a few more items....then shortly after the account gets suspended again. Lol I gave up for the night at that point but will be calling tn and will update on this post. It just keeps getting better and better",3,3,2018-07-19,EBAY,0.09783422201871872,0.8680790662765503,0.03408678248524666
Ebay,A monumental achievement for sellers everywhere. I WON AN APPEAL AS A SELLER.,"If any of you haven't read my post on here just go to my history and you can read about the incident. 

Basically I sold a listing with 5 Dungeons and Dragons items. Two were damaged during shipping. I told the buyer he had to send ALL 5 back for full refund. He only sent 2 back. He opened case, Ebay gave him his full $300.00 back AND he kept the 3 items. 

After numerous calls, NUMEROUS complaints, EBAY told me to appeal. I had 5 days to go to the police. 

After going to the VAN NUYS police last night at 10:00 pm, I witnessed a fight while I was parking,  witnessed a woman talking to her herself also. I walked in,  put my two Dungeons and Dragons action figures on the front desk of the police station. THEY LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS AN ABSOLUTE MORON.

Basically they said they couldnt help and its a civil matter. I had the officer though write a brief statement and give his badge number and phone. I scanned and sent it to EBAY. I called in and they REMOVED THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK and REFUNDED MY MONEY. 

I am a very honest person. I live by the rules of Karma. I was not going to let this buyer get away with this. I told him over and over he must send all 5 back. I called Ebay before I approved the request and told them what he was going to do. 

Without me going to the police, I wouldve lost. The police told me what is common knowledge, ITS A CIVIL MATTER BETWEEN EBAY, THE BUYER, and ME. They wont help, and really what can they do anyway, its a he said/she said even though I had the packages weights as evidence. 

In the end I fought and won, unfortunately the buyer won also, but this is still a glimmer of hope for Ebay sellers everywhere. 

I also filed with the US postal service inspection but nothing is going to come of that.",23,70,2018-07-20,EBAY,0.0741729736328125,0.9007489085197449,0.025078093633055687

Ebay,Unfairly banned many years ago,"Hello,

I was unfairly banned many years ago when EBAY rolled out the DSR program as an experienced power seller. Went on to grow an amazon business selling the same exact products with stellar feedback and reviews (which I have since closed).

Ebay,"Buying from Croatia - Caution, Customs Irregularities","*This information is intended for all those buying goods for personal use from outside EU and importing them into Croatia - an EU member country.* For the last several months whenever I've attempted to buy goods from outside the EU, the goods were met by serious Croatian customs office irregularities in addition with serious irregularities committed by local subcontractors and affiliates of the shipping companies used to deliver the goods.

The irregularities are as follows:

I am buying as a citizen for personal use, *I am not operating goods on the market or providing them to the market*, I am consuming goods - yet the Croatian customs office attempts to enforce the EORI use which is a universal EU numeric identifier attributed to businesses intended for easier import filing and processing and is as such inapplicable to personal purchases. The Croatian customs office contrary to EU law insists on being provided with an EORI number, which the Croatian customs office issues. To acquire this number one must personally request it by filling out a physical request form which then must be delivered in person to the Customs office. After an undefined period of 'processing' an EORI number is formed and assigned by the Customs office.

It is important to note here that the EORI number is not calculated, or crunched by powerful computers, it is simply the already existing Personal Identification Number (OIB) present on the ID of every Croatian citizen, but preceded by the addition of the prefix HR, while the Customs office is free to assign it the moment an individual receives a packet from abroad, or even prior to it. Though, lest we forget, there is no need for any of this as by EU law the EORI number is not intended for personal use imports of citizens.

During the unnecessary and unnecessarily long period of applying for an EORI number and having one assigned, the local subcontractors and affiliates of large shipping companies - like FedEx, UPS, DHL, DPD - attempt to apply a large additional charge on the shipment recipient, usually several times larger than the price of the goods purchased, justified either as a shipment storage fee or a processing fee, regardless of the already payed shipping charges.

For these reason I have refused to receive the last several purchases I made. As potential buyers, be cautioned of these practices as they are standard and official.

Ebay,Forced Insertion Fee if Best Offer is turned off?,"Hi,
I've sold things a few times on ebay before, but am not very experienced with it. I have some games I'm trying to sell off, and I've created the drafts for the listing. However something new is appearing at the bottom, threatening me with an insertion fee if I don't allow best offer.

For reference, these are single disc video games, they're an auction listing. I don't want offers on because quite frankly, I won't be accepting offers (it's an auction listing after all). Is there a reason for this, am I too new of a seller? It's only appearing on this one listing so far and not the others, and I just recently sold a game without an issue. Add to it that I have plenty of free insertions for the month and I'm rather confused as to what is happening right now.

The item must have been a fake or something (in hindsight, the price was a little too good to be true, and that was my mistake). The seller was US-based and had 100% feedback, but I guess I should've been a bit more judicious about the product.

In any case, the item has not been marked as shipped yet, so I'm wondering if I should get in touch with eBay or PayPal now and see if I can get my money back. The seller is no longer registered on eBay.

I recently sold my GPU and shipped it to Florida.
This buyer claims to have received it broken. Upon hearing this I say return it and I'll issue a refund. This is the what he responded. 

Wow do not tell me this that could be damaged in the shipment. I am currently in the Dominican Republic and the cost of shipping by FedEx is $ 120. which is quite high to send. I just took it to prepare and they are charging me $ 100 for the repair. I understand that this is not your fault, but I want you to understand that it is not my fault either and that I pay for something that works not for something that comes with problems. I'm going to put half of the cost of the repair, I see that you can help me pay the other half. I understand that this may be a fairer solution. although I may end up losing at the end. I am looking forward to your response. Thank you

Has this been going on all along — **the instruction to open a PayPal case** — or is this some sort of fallout from the switch by eBay to a new payments system?

As a seller, I always took some sort of comfort in my assumption that most buyers did not know that they could open a new case with PayPal once they had been declined by eBay, and that they did not know how ridiculously long the PayPal claims window was.

Ebay,Lost package just showed up. Any advice please?,"Guys, I need some advice.

Around 2 months ago I bought a pair of shoes on eBay, I mistakenly sent them to my old address, and attempted to redirect the package with USPS. That redirect service did not work and the shoes were finally delivered to a wrong ZIP code, according to the tracking number. I contacted eBay and they asked me to tell the seller to file a complaint with USPS so they would investigate. The seller told me that he had proof that he had sent the shoes to the right address (which he did, I saw the receipt), so it wasn't their fault; when I asked them to file a complaint they never replied, so it seems they never did. eBay ended up giving me a refund for the purchase. 

I just got an email from a USPS representative saying that they found the package, and they would like me to tell them if they should send to my new address or back to the sender. I already received a refund so I would not like to have them sent to my address because that would be theft. I was wondering since I received the refund, did eBay take that money from the seller or did they keep it? Because if I send them back to them and they kept the money, that would not be right either. I was thinking of contacting the seller and ask them if they would take the same price I paid originally.

Ebay,"It happened to me, I got a shitty buyer","So... after reading here, and experiencing it myself I don't do auctions any longer. 

My last auction was a jewelry set (4) that I had to take down from other sites listing @ $100 because the auction completed at $30. 

$#*!?&amp;! 

Really there are no words. I sucked it up and completed the transaction. This package arrived Friday at noon. This morning I get a return request because the bracelets are ""tarnished"" ( uh, Brighton doesn't tarnish. There's a coating on the metal) I called ebay, the rep tells me to ask for pictures. The rep says my pics clearly show the item is not damaged. We then have a discussion about how I packaged the item. ( wrapped in fabric) 

So the buyer keeps replying to my request for pictures without pictures!! Seriously, I want them back I can sell them for a better price!! 

I think I'm being scammed, too many 😞 and lies. My personal opinion is they needed it to match an outfit last night and are trying to get a partial refund. 

Not just nope. Hell nope!! Being that I'm new I took losses on the sale, I took losses on the shipping. ( it was a set of 4... I didn't realize it was too heavy!)

Ebay,Missing package signed for and marked as delivered,"I recently ordered a package from Japan for $200+ CAD I chose the EMS shipping option which comes with signature required delivery.

The reason I chose this option was that I don't live in the best neighbourhood so if my package gets left at the front door, in all likelihood it'll get stolen.

So on Tuesday, I was at work and I received a notification on my phone alerting me that my package has been signed for, I was a bit worried but I figured it was probably a mistake so I didn't think anything of it.

Once I got home I looked at the update again and saw that I could view the recorded signature, so I did, it was just a scribble and they also provided a name for who signed which was ”C J” I didn't understand at first but I then realized that the name for who signed was most likely meant to be my initials.

I waited until the end of the week and then went into Canada post to see what was going on, they said that the package had been delivered but that's all they could tell me.

I then contacted the seller on eBay telling him what had happened, and he told me to file a claim with Canada Post and then file the claim and then he will investigate. I can't do this due to the fact that I get all my packages shipped to me under a fake name.

What can I do in this situation?",7,2,2018-07-28,EBAY,0.12591876089572906,0.8455469012260437,0.028534363955259323

Ebay,Please help! ebay seller is holding my smart phone. What are my options?,"Hi guys, this is my first post here. 

I paid for a iPhone repair from ebay on July 14 (about a week and half ago). I sent my phone to the seller to be repaired on July 16, Monday, and the phone arrived on July 18, Wednesday. 

The seller made no contact with me for the next 3 days. I messaged him that Friday requesting an update. He said my Phone will be repaired and be sent out the next Monday, which is this past Monday. Monday came around and I heard nothing from him. Because of this i sent him a message on Monday, Tuesday, then again on Thursday. After not getting anymore responses from him I opened a case with ebay yesterday. 

After the case is opened, the seller uploaded a tracking number and messaged me saying that the phone is fixed and will be sent out today. He also asked that I close the case since the tracking number is uploaded. I replied back and said I will close the case when I have my phone back and it is repaired. Nothing was received by Fedex today according to the tracking number.

I have used ebay for many years, and have never had any problems with any transections. I've been very reasonable and polite with the seller in the past 2 weeks, but this is getting ridiculous.

I'm located California. The seller is based in California as well and has a physical mobile repair shop. The phone I sent in is a gold 64GB iPhone 6 plus.

My question is what are my options here? If he does not return my phone or return a tampered phone what can I do? Lastly, should I file a police report for missing/stolen phone?

Ebay,Can I get any blowback from reporting a listing/users on ebay?,"My partner has been selling games on ebay for a while. 

Recently 2 people/buyers tried to scam us (they seem to be serial offenders running the same basic 'lost item' scam over and over but as they are top-rated sellers themselves ebay seems to not be doing anything about them, despite the fact we've proven they are full of crap and running this scam on loads of other sellers) but in the end we beat them so we weren't out of pocket and blocked them / moved on.

They are prolific sellers (whereas my partner just does it as a part time side gig) in the same product categories as us so technically they are the competition but we don't mind that as there's plenty of biz for everyone. My issue is they have text all over their photos which I find frustrating because they are gaming and profiting off the system with their scams and then when they resell their scammed items they're not even sticking to basics like listing rules!

I want to report their listings (not because they are technically our competition because I have no issue with competition when it's basically fair), but because they should be punished for at least something and their listings/photos are against the rules.

Ebay,Apple return and resend scam (Flaw in the process?),"This is the backstory, its pretty simple:

* Bought brand new MacBook on apple.com
* listed the new item on ebay (using stock photos and such), since I hadn't received the physical item form apple yet.

I get a couple of inquiries about providing a serial number of the device (I'm assuming to verify that the item is not stolen.... this is normal?). I search around and I conclude that its safe to give that out to interested buyers.

The problem is that I did not have the serial number available, since I haven't received the item from Apple yet. Therefore, I respond to the interested buyers that the serial number would be provided before the auction ends and before the item ships out. Seems fair, I conclude, since I would be obligated to provide that information since I said I would in the private messaging systems on eBay.

In one case, however, the interested buyer asked if I at least have the order number. I further conclude that it should be ok too.

This is where it gets weird.

The day that I received the package by UPS, and I signed for it. There were calls made to Apple Support that the order in question was just an empty box. Apple then contacted UPS to investigate the claim. I received two total emails: one from Apple and one from UPS, stating that something is wrong with my order.

I initially ignored both of them as I figured since I have the order in my hands, they were probably sent out in error.

I happen to log into my Apple account a few days later, and I noticed that I have two pending orders. **One order requesting that I send back the MacBook by a certain date, and another order indicating that my replacement MacBook is preparing to  ship out.**

This was all very confusing so I called Support to resolve.

After an hour of conversation and trying to understand the situation, it turns out that what happened was:

On the day that my package was delivered, someone called Apple concerning my order that it was damaged. (This triggered the first emails)

A few days later, somebody called in again concerning the order and asked that a replacement MacBook be sent, and asked that the shipping address be changed as well as the shipping email. (This is different than the Apple Account information).

According to Apple, they tried multiple times to contact me via phone, since they call the number on the Apple Account to verify, but they were unable to reach me.

Long story short, they were able to to block the replacement item to ship to the different address since I called in and resolved it.

My question is obvious. How did this happen?

I asked the Apple rep, whether, its possible for someone to use public information to do what that. My name, address, phone number, and order number are public information -- yes its private, but they are no secret. 

Was there a hole in the verification process on Apple's part that this replacement shipment was approved?

If Apple failed to reach me, should not the default action have been to not proceed with anything? 

I brought these questions up to the rep and she kept saying that its possible that a neighbor, or someone found my apple receipt with my order number. This again raises the question: Should the apple receipt be considered as a password?

Ebay,New scam targeting sellers,"Hi all,

I just want to give a warning to all my fellow ebay sellers.

There are buyers now who purchase items only to intercept your packages.

Once its intercepted they claim it was an unauthorized transaction.  Paypal will not cover you because it was intercepted.

YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ITEM AND YOUR MONEY.

I tried everything

* from writing DO NOT INTERCEPT on the box, (USPS still did it anyway)
* called USPS right when I noticed it was intercepted, they assured me they would not deliver it to the intercepted address (but it was delivered anyway)
* filed claims with [ic3.gov](https://ic3.gov) for fraud
* called paypal after the claim was filed, they would not help me because the tracking was not delivered to the address.

To wrap up, paypal, ebay or usps will not help you.  You need to do your own research to protect yourself.

The only ways I could think of to protect yourself is

* use UPS and request direct delivery only.
* use USPS but intercept your own package to make sure they cannot put in a request (extra cost/work required)
* check your tracking after you ship your packages on [https://retail-pi.usps.com/retailpi/actions/index.action](https://retail-pi.usps.com/retailpi/actions/index.action)
   * some of these buyers are slick and put in an intercept request right after you drop off the package.
   * IF YOU CANNOT INTERCEPT THE PACKAGE IT MEANS THERE IS ALREADY A REQUEST TO DO SO. (aka scam in progress)

Ebay,PayPal just stole $42 from me.,"LAST EDIT: Persistence pays off.  https://imgur.com/a/q0yc0mA to be honest this felt like more of a “stop bothering us” than actually siding with me. Either way I’ve got every penny back. Leaving this thread up in case someone can learn from it.


EDIT: Called and they refunded $20 chargeback fee and said they will reopen the case and that they are now waiting on the buyers bank to respond.


Sold $22 item March 6th.

Shipped March 7th to verified PayPal address with eBay shipping label.

July 7th buyer files a charge back with her bank claiming fraudulent charge.

PayPal puts funds on hold. I respond with “no communication from buyer in last 4 months since purchase. Shipped to PayPal address with eBay label” and also provide the tracking number.

Today I get an email that says since I never provided proof of delivery (I provided tracking info that was generated by eBay) that they are siding against me and taking the $22 and slapping me with a $20 charge back fee!!!

It’s not a ton of money but I’m still pissed because I did everything correctly and the transaction even says I’m eligible for seller protection.

The only thing I can think of is that USPS purges tracking numbers after 120 days... which it has been over that amount. But in no way is that my fault or responsibility.

Ebay,Another tale of a bad buyer,"Here is my tale of woe. :) I am the seller. Buyer is new to eBay. I have never had an issue like this ever.

Buyer bought my item several weeks ago. Paid immediately. I sent the item to the eBay and PayPal approved address.

A week passes and I have a notice at my post office for an item pickup. Weird. I go and it's the item I had sent out with an RTS on it. ""No house number in the address"".

I thought a wrong address was a violation issue so I called eBay and they say to contact the buyer and await their reply. I offer to reship if the buyer pays me for shipping it out a second time. Buyer says OK but they need a few days.

I wait and send another message offering to cancel the order and refund their cost minus shipping or to send the buyer a PayPal invoice for the reshipping charge and make it due in 3 days time. I do the latter.

Several days pass. Buyer says they cannot pay the reship charge. I instruct them we can cancel but instead today I get a Return Request. They are trying to return an item I have and I cannot cancel now.

Apparently my options are: (a) 'accept the return and pay for return shipping'. But I have the item already. I don't know what happens in this case? Would they get the full refund including shipping? They don't deserve a full refund for their mistake. I don't want a defect for issues out of my control.

(b) 'send them a full refund and the buyer keeps the item' -- again that's not happening. We already said I'm not paying for their shipping address error.

(c) Send the buyer a partial refund minus the shipping. This is what I am leaning towards. If they accept, am I liable for a defect?

Or (d) should I call eBay in the morning and ask for assistance?",1,2,2018-07-31,EBAY,0.09649389982223511,0.875386655330658,0.028119448572397232
