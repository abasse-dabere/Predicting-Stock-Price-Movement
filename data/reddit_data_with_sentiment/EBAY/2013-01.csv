Ebay,Shipping a Vinyl LP Record without bubble wrap?,I don't have enough bubble wrap and I'm wondering if it's a good idea or a bad idea to ship it without bubble wrap.  It's a mint condition record but only sold for $5 since it's nothing special and I have it between two cardboard cut outs in a LP mailer.

Ebay,Why would an ebay user change their User ID more than a dozen times?,"Hello everyone,
So, I can't show you a screenshot right now because I'm on the go, but I will update later. I just got a bidder with a user ID that is a string of numbers. When I look at their ID history, there's been more than a dozen user ID changes since 2008, with some names seemingly coherent, and others a string of random numbers or letters. Some changes have no more than a few weeks between them. WTF? The item is a government affairs pamphlet from WWII, the kind of collectible which normally I sell to buffs,  so I'm shaded out. Any reasonable explanations for this user ID history? Thanks in advance, as always :)

Ebay,Anyone else had tracking numbers not upload when shipping internationally?,"I have been shipping internationally for ~6 years and just experienced this a couple times this month. I printed the labels through the eBay label printer which normally automatically uploads the tracking numbers to the sold items page and for the buyer to see. In December, I shipped maybe 75-100 items internationally and had two of the tracking numbers fail to upload. I did not notice until the buyers contacted me asking for the number. The item was automatically marked as shipped but the number does not appear on the sold items page, sales record, Paypal transaction, or order details. I have shipped other packages using the same service (USPS First Class International) to the same countries and had the tracking numbers show up. Has this happened to anyone else and can anyone think of a way to retrieve them?

I should add that they are really not ""tracking numbers"" but rather the customs form number. They do not usually provide tracking information outside of the United States, but if the buyer does not see the number, they seem to think that it has not been shipped. Likewise, if the item does not arrive, I need the tracking number to file a claim.",2.0,2,2013-01-02,EBAY,0.03216058015823364,0.9319152235984802,0.03592419624328613

Ebay,99% sure USPS lost my package,"The 45 day time frame for Ebay complaints has passed just yesterday so I opened an Ebay claim on the last few minutes just so I can have something to leverage. The seller seems alright. They provided tracking and shipping information gladly. 

On my part, I optioned to still want the item I purchased, and offered to wait out the week to see if something comes up. However I'm not very hopeful. The last update from USPS was on the first of December. I also checked with the local main services (international priority mail btw) and they were sure the package has not touched the national shores yet.

As I see it I have three options now:

1. Try to fix things with the seller. The item is insured up to half of it's worth so the seller might not take it to badly to refund.
2. Escalate the resolution with Ebay costumer care.
3. Start a PayPal claim for a refund.

Ebay,I just need some peculiar things explained to me about my recent purchase (may be a scam?),"Hey guys,

4 days ago I bought a new Razer Lycosa keyboard as seen here:

http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Cool-Razer-Lycosa-Expert-Gaming-Keyboard-Backlight-Macro-Programmable-New-Sealed-/140902300994?pt=PCA_Mice_Trackballs&amp;hash=item20ce6e7d42&amp;_uhb=1#ht_664wt_1139

Some things about it that are making me uncomfortable:

1. It's dirt cheap for a new keyboard of this type. The next cheapest one on ebay is almost double the price including shipping. This made me uneasy.

2. The seller has never sold anything else and has no feedback, and yet has, as of this post, sold 21 of these keyboards.

3. I sent the seller a message asking for an indication about postage time, but I've had no reply 2 days later, and my payment has not yet been accepted.

These things are all very peculiar, and I don't quite know why it's taking so long to process my payment. Despite paying immediately, the seller has yet to accept my payment.

Ebay,"Returned to eBay after 5 year hiatus, so bear with me.  - Help with the final fee","Background 

* New Account

* jewelry 

* auction style, lasted 3 days with $10 shipping


So..I recently sold an item, and the total came to be $260 (inlcuding shipping).  Once transferred to my paypal account, it was $252.16.  Confused, I called up customer service and they told me that the decrease was the result of the final fee that ebay charges, which I completely understand and remember.  The thing is, $7.84 is nowhere near the 9% that is stated on the site.  So...what's the big deal? I'm not complaining or anything, I'm just wondering what's up.  

For the record, the customer service woman that I spoke with let me know there would be no more charges to the payment so the fee that was charged to me was the final seller's fee or whatever it's called.

Ebay,eBay Rewards Card - eBay MasterCard or PayPal Extras MasterCard (or other)?,"I'm really getting into eBay lately (purchasing Lego sets), and feel like I could be doing better with rewards than my Amazon Rewards Visa. I currently only have one credit card after canceling one a few months ago.

Anyway, I'm looking into the eBay and PayPal credit cards...and I can't seem to find a compelling reason to take one over the other - from the overview, they seem to offer the same features (including 2X rewards points on eBay and PayPal purchases), although the PayPal one seems to offer better integration with PayPal, while the eBay one offers a $30 statement credit on signing up. Not concerned about APR as I'd always be paying it off in full.

I'm also concerned about how much the points actually translate into in terms of money. For Amazon, 1 point is equivalent to a $0.01. If ""2X"" rewards points means $0.02 per $1, then I'm sold. From what I understand, I can't actually see what the rewards points translate to without opening the account, which is why I'm asking.

Ebay,Question about Seller Protection and tracked deliveries.,"So I've sold an item through eBay in the UK to a UK buyer, a £15 bottle of perfume to be precise. 

The item was dispatched the same day it was paid for by Royal Mail First Class Recorded Signed For delivery, here is where my headache starts. I lost the tracking number and have no proof it arrived, the buyer is claiming they didn't recieve it so I royally screwed myself.

Obviously this was my fault and I bit the bullet making apologies to the buyer, I asked if they would like a replacement or refund and they said a replacement if I could guarantee it would arrive before Christmas and that they were also staying at another address for Christmas and would need it sent there.

I wasn't sure but since I made the mistake I agreed to send the item by Royal Mail Next Day Delivery, I confirmed the specific address with the buyer through eBay's messaging and stuck that on a parcel and sent it.

The buyer is now claiming that this item didn't arrive either which conflicts with my tracking saying it has been delivered on time to the given address. (I didn't have a name for the address but the tracking shows the correct home owners name for the parcel)

Where do I stand here liability wise? I've never had a recorded item not arrive before and now its happened to the same buyer twice which makes me suspicious. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.",6.0,3,2013-01-12,EBAY,0.0755755826830864,0.8882761597633362,0.036148324608802795

Ebay,Update: Here it comes... buyer saying phone he bought *doesnt work*,"I posted this post two weeks ago- [http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/15k50q/here_it_comes_buyer_saying_phone_he_bought_doesnt/](Link)

Wanted to update the story.

The buyer ended up opening a case against me and then stopped responding to me. I told him to return the phone and I would refund him. He didn't talk to me for over a week, so I escalated the case, which eBay obviously found in his favor. He put in UPS tracking information and then kept pestering me about if I got the phone yet. UPS said he didn't even mail the phone.

Then today, I got the phone in the mail from USPS. The guy wrote on the box, didn't return the case with the phone and sent me the wrong cable (sent me a motorola cable instead of the LG cable I sent him). Get this.... **THE PHONE WORKS**. This guy is just a liar! I recorded a video of myself opening the package so that he couldn't say I took stuff out, etc etc. I called eBay today to ask them what would happen in this situation. The girl told me that the buyer has to send me everything back that came with the auction and in the same condition as I sent it to him. So by now, I don't even care about the money since the phone DOES work and I can sell it to someone else (NOT ON EBAY &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;) I just want this guys life to suck since he blantanly lied to me and cost me quite a bit of money in shipping (almost $20 down the drain). I messaged him and told him to send me the rest of the stuff back or he won't be getting his full refund and that he won't be ANYWAY since he ""damaged"" the box.

The lesson here is don't sell a phone to someone who has 0 feedback. They may end up being a lying douche bag.",4.0,2,2013-01-12,EBAY,0.0509873665869236,0.9186246991157532,0.030387910082936287

I bought a large fiberglass statue from this seller in New York. He has an 800+ feedback rating, 100% positive.

After I sent him the payment, he calls me to tell me that he drastically underestimated the shipping cost (by around $200).

Finally he graciously agrees to eat the shipping cost.

I get a notification that it's been shipped. He says he's waiting for a tracking number from UPS(?), but he never inputs it.

Today, 8 days later, I get an email from him that it's ""in my area"". He includes a phone number to call, and a ""UPS"" tracking number. Problem is, the phone number belongs to some dude named Joe. The tracking number is not even enough digits to be a UPS tracking number.

So, of course I have no way of checking on the parcel.

Ebay,Suspected Buyer Scam - Need Advice,"I recently sold an iPhone 4 to a seemingly legitimate buyer. The buyer paid within a couple days after winning the auction and I shipped it the day after I recieved payment. I payed for package tracking and saw that the buyer recieved the package on the 11th. I didn't hear anything from the buy so I figured that everything was fine but this morning I got an email directly from the buyer (not through eBay) saying the iPhone had a broken screen and that they need $45 to pay for repairs. I thoroughly checked the iPhone and all the items being shipped with it before shipping it and saw that everything was in working order and nothing was broken. I would think that the buyer would have noticed a damaged package and checked the item immediately and would have messaged me the day that they recieved it if the item was broken during shipping.

Do you guys think I should give the person the $45, just refund the person their money back and (hopefully) recieve the iPhone back, or make a dispute to eBay?

Edit: Thank you all for the great advice! This is the first time that I've had to deal with a possible scammer on eBay and all your advice will be useful if I have to deal with more scammers in the future.

I listed a Mac Pro with a GeForce 8800GT, posted a photo of the card installed, etc.  Guy sends me a message claiming that it cannot be correct because the official ones are a different color and this one is probably a flashed PC graphics card.  I emailed him a link to the auction where I originally bought it where it shows some more detail and said I would understand if he passed up my auction for one that better met his specific needs.  

He eventually bids on a wins my auction.  After he pays and I've purchased my shipping label he sends me another message, this time saying oh no I think I've made a huge mistake and asks me to look into the video card again.  I told him that I already gave him the information 2 days ago, gave him the link again and said I wasn't sure what he was asking.

He received the mac pro late last night and today is complaining that the video card is not correct, again.  He want's to talk on the phone to resolve, which I'm ok with, I just want to see what you guys would advice, what is my position here, and am I in the right or wrong?

Ebay,"Just lost my job, really, really needing advice on how to ramp up my eBay operation into full-time income","Hey guys, 

To make a long story short, I lost my job today (was there for just over 2 yrs) and have been running an eBay operation at a part-time level, now will probably try to turn it into full time.

The full story is: My original idea for eBay income was to go to smaller businesses and sell their stuff on eBay for a commission. I only have one client at the moment and am making about $100-$250/month from that. I've only recently (as of Jan. 1st 2013) been doing the goodwill reselling gig and am averaging around $80-$100/day before fees this way. 
My original plan was to use my job to fund my eBay business and slowly move out of my job. Now I can't do that and am needing SERIOUS advice on where to go from here. For money, I'll be getting my tax return in a month and I'll also be cashing out my 401K. I know thats not a generally not a good idea but seeing as I am only 20 yrs old I'll have plenty of time to get another one going. All in all, I'll probably have around $5-7K to get this going. 
What I'm wondering is how to make the most out of the least of this money to where I can make some semi-decent money on my own. 

Now my quickly formed plan is to use up to $1K to buy a lot of inventory at goodwills/storage auctions/etc and liquidate as fast as possible and repeat again and again. Last year on a part time basis I made just under $9K, does around $2-$3K/month seem doable at all?? And what's the best way to get there??

Ebay,Where's the scam? Or... am I the scammer?,"I've only ever sold one item on eBay before, which went smoothly, so I'm not sure of the etiquette when something goes wrong. Here's the story:

* I list an unwanted bottle of high-end $300 aftershave on eBay.

* Several people bid. Then the auction closes and there's a winning bid plus postage.

* My heart sinks when I see a Nigerian-looking name. I expect a fake money order or some shenanigans like that.

* However he has a star by his name and more than 3,000 pieces of positive feedback.

* Then I realise that my description of the bottle is wrong. It was 2oz and I listed it as 4oz.

* The buyer transfers the money to my PayPal account.

* I toy with sending the bottle anyway (the volume isn't marked) but wanting to do the decent thing I contact the buyer via PayPal and explain my mistake, offering a full refund, saying I'll re-list it with the correct description.

* He says he's prepared to buy the smaller bottle but wants me to give him a new price.

* I tell him a new price and offer to refund part of his money ($50, proportionate to the retail price of the smaller bottle) and send him the bottle.

* I never hear from him again.

That was ten days ago. The money is still there in PayPal. I still have the goods. I'm waiting for him to accept or negotiate my offer and I'll send him the package.

From my point-of-view I've already paid the eBay charge for the higher price, but I can minimize the hit; if I list again I'll pay another eBay charge - which I guess I should be prepared for because it was my mistake - but then again he did express the desire to buy for a lower price.

In this situation, what is legal? What is ethical? Should I just refund the guy now, take the hit, or should I hang on and wait for his reply? 

Or am I the potential victim of some kind of eBay scam, which has been confounded only by my incompetence? If so, what could it be? Or am I just being prejudiced because he has an African name?

Thanks for any opinions you may have!

Edit: he finally got back to me and rejected the new offer, asking for a full refund. I did this, simultaneously cancelling the sale in the hope I'll get the eBay fee back, but that's dependent on him accepting the cancellation. Which he has no incentive to do. I'll just cross my fingers and hope he does. Will relist it next week with the correct dimensions.

Ebay,Aftermath: 99% sure USPS lost my package,"Let me being by saying that now I absolutely **abhor** USPS. 

This is the issue I have with one of my [purchases.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/15y0h5/99_sure_usps_lost_my_package/). *tl;dr: Package was probably lost, deadline for refunds expired and I was unsure what to do about it.*

After another week of waiting with, no further news, I asked the seller to do something more other than tell me to just wait. I expected him to file a claim with USPS or something. Instead he ignored the core of my request and went on a fruitless litany of hope involving his faith, Jesus and Christianity all out of the blue. Being somewhat frustrated with this (not the Jesus stuff; the way he chose to ignore my request) I escalated the claim to Ebay and they granted me a full refund. And all was over, until yesterday.

I get a letter from my local mail services saying that some package has just arrived but is stuck at customs because of a lack of information and therefore an inability to verify whether it was to be tax exempt or not and that I have to pay them (the mail service) to deal with customs so that I can get it. It also says that they will return it to the seller without further notice if I don't contact them within a month.

In the meantime I was no longer interested in this purchase as I had already bought, paid for and had deliver a similar item. But, being somewhat of fool, I contacted the seller and told him everything as it is written down here. I also gave him what I presumed to be a good choice. Either I leave the package alone and he gets it back without further delay, or I take it but subtract the small cost ($20) that it takes to resolve the customs issue that he created in the first place.

However from him I get an angry rant about how I should pay in full and that he did specify the value of the package and that he wants no further contact from me. He also said he contacted Ebay Resolution Center with a copy of my request. Now I suspect the biggest culprit here is USPS which not only lost the package and delivered it a month later but also left out most of the important information that should have been labeled on the package before being sent over to my country.

At this point I don't know what to do and have resolved to just wait and see what happens. I have no desire to pay extra for a package that I don't want anymore because others fucked up and definitely not after the absolutely shitty service that I received from both the seller and USPS.

I would love any suggestions.

EDIT: I forgot to mention. The package was found and shipped after the seller filed a complaint with USPS but he didn't bother to file a compliant when I asked him to.

Ebay,Has anyone ever auctioned an iPhone? I have a slight issue.,"I usually don't sell anything valued more than $50 or $60, so I'm really wary about my current 16GB iPhone auction (NIB), and it appears my gut wasn't too far off. I received a message from a person in Russia asking if I would change my shipping settings to ship it internationally. I told them no. The next day, a different person in Russia bid on my auction, and then sent me this message: 

""Hello, please cancel a bet on your lot, because you do not deliver to Russia, it happened by accident, because that knocked filter settings, and again Sorry for earlier thanks.""

That got me very irritated, to say the least. They accidentally bid on my auction? They accidentally went through the process of bidding on my item... only to *then* realize it was USA because it didn't occur soon enough that their filter settings were ""knocked?"" Uhhuh. Right. Honestly, I think it's the same person, using a different account. 

So, irrelevant conspiracy bullshit aside, I figure I'm just going to hope they are outbid, and if they aren't, what are my options? I don't really want to cancel my auction. I've never been in a situation where someone won my auction, living in a country to where I don't ship. Does eBay tell me I need to ship it? Will eBay recognize the winner lives in Russia, and because I didn't choose Russia for my shipping, I will be absolved? 

Edit: Just some ranty detail, if you care to read.

This current Russian person only has 2 feedback, neither of which items are public. The first Russian person told me ""I'm a good buyer look at my feedbacks."" The ONLY feedback reply I could view on their list had this comment: ""Buyer has not paid for my item, booo two thumbs down! Really messed my sale up"". And lo and behold, what was it?

Ebay,Someone explain this scammer,"So I was greedy and this 0 feedback account was selling cash. I wasn't the only greedy guy, he got lots of bids, but still under the face value. (Legitimate sellers seem to sell cash for way over its face value, no idea what's going on there.)

Of course he didn't send the item, but he did send a tracked box through the post which was empty. After 3 weeks paypal refunded me.

Interestingly, I find that this guy has made tens of accounts and repeated the scam multiple times over a few months. Here is one of his accounts: http://myworld.ebay.co.uk/ddd.derick
For some reason, he decided to pay for a buyer feedback AFTER scamming...

I can't understand why paypal would let him get away with this, especially since he kept coming back and trying again. Further more, he was wasting his own money sending tracked boxes when he could have just not sent anything at all. It isn't like he tried to contest when buyers said they didn't receive their items.

Eventually I managed to stop this guy by bidding up his listings and winning all of his fake auctions. I then left neg feedback so he couldn't use the account again.

Now I assume that he has tried to withdraw the money to a bank account, which would have gone through in the time it takes paypal to refund people. What I can't tell is if this is a very successful scam against paypal (since every buyer who loses out gets refunded) or if he is the stupidest scammer ever and always gets his accounts frozen, but tries the same thing again and again.

Ebay,Question about shipping fees:,"I apologize if this is misuse of this sub-reddit, but after scanning the rules on ebay and being an inexperienced buyer, I deem it necessary to ask a third party(you guys) about an issue I currently faced with.

So, I win an auction for a 300 dollar item, and the shipping fee states that it is 24 dollars. (USPS from New York to Toronto Canada). I message the guy before the auction closes and we agree that I can have the item for 330. He also states that shipping will be 60 dollars, then.
I'm a little confused at why shipping would be more expensive, but as I said, I'm an inexperienced buyer.

So, I pay him 390 upfront on paypal, and a couple days later he states that shipping is actually 110 dollars and I should pay 25 dollars for the packaging materials.

I look at the seller's page and see that all additional fees should be mentioned upfront, and that he should pay for the rest of it.

He says fine.

When my package comes, it's 50 dollars Cash on Demand.

So, is this violating ebay policy?

We agreed I'm paying 60 for shipping and I paid twice that? We agreed on a price and then he manipulated it.

tl;dr I think I was ripped off on shipping prices.

Edit: 
I should note it's a fairly heavy item, so 110 dollars for shipping isn't so out there, but it's the fact that I was lied to about the shipping costs as being almost half what they were when I purchased the item.",14.0,2,2013-01-25,EBAY,0.0772891417145729,0.8938919305801392,0.02881890907883644

Ebay,What should I do about this?  (Fake item),"This has been bugging me, and I'd like to disclaim first off that I am very aware that the situation I'm in is completely my fault.  I know that, but I still feel like I should do something.

That said:  I bought a used microphone (Shure SM57) many months ago.  Being busy, and not ready to use it yet, I never messed with it for weeks after.  When I finally did get around to messing with it, I realized that it wasn't performing right.  Lots of research later, I determined physically and electronically that it was a fake.  I notified the seller the same night I determined this, and he admitted that he did sell me a fake (he passed it off as real in the description).  He said to send it back if I wanted a refund.  Very stupidly, I didn't.  In retrospect, I don't have any good reasons why not, but it is what it is.  

This was all months ago now.  I'm not expecting or looking for a refund.  I know that my inactivity is to blame for that.  My issue is that I still feel like something should be done, but I don't know what.  If this guy is tricking buyers and knowingly passing fake items as real, I feel like he should be reported or something.  I don't know how or if you can do that.  I've considered leaving negative feedback and warning buyers that he sold me a fake item, but I'm afraid of coming off as a total dick, who's just now taking any kind of action months after the fact.  Like, for some reason I'm afraid of pissing him off, since I feel responsible for my situation.

I guess the issue is more of a social anxiety one, but I just want to get your guys's opinions on what I should do.",3.0,1,2013-01-25,EBAY,0.11897061765193939,0.8530048727989197,0.028024446219205856

Price plus the uncertainty of losing the auction and I rarely try with auctions anymore - and bidding with the price I'm willing to pay just seems to attract people who (I think?) only want to win no matter how expensive the item gets.

Ebay,"New changes to ebay shipping... also, maybe a problem...","I just received this email from ebay and it's going to affect anyone using parcel post as well as shipping in general since the price is going up.

&gt;Dear user,

As someone who has used eBay Labels to purchase Parcel Post® in the past, we want to tell you about a recently-announced change that will go into effect January 27, 2013.

USPS will discontinue Parcel Post service as of January 27, 2013. Active listings with Parcel Post will automatically be updated to the new comparable replacement service—Parcel Select®—which will be available in the selling flow and shipping calculator as of January 27.

Know that the new Parcel Select service will not be available for purchase through eBay Labels until March. Sellers that wish to utilize this service before it is available via eBay Labels—and sellers who have sold items with the Parcel Select service—will need to go to the post office or an alternate online postage provider (i.e. Pitney Bowes, Endicia.com, Stamps.com, etc.) to purchase this class of service. Also, be sure to upload tracking information within your stated handling time. If you would like to continue to take advantage of the convenience of eBay Labels until Parcel Select is added to the eBay Labels system, consider temporarily offering a similar service.

As always, thank you for selling on eBay!

Sincerely,

The eBay Shipping Team

Ebay,Pretty sure I've been scammed out of ~$2100. How do I go about getting my money back?,"Ugh. Dammit. I hear about this all the time on eBay but have never actually been scammed myself. That's probably changed. 

I'm a student, and I managed to scrimp and save my meager money together for months until I had enough to purchase a new MacBook for university. Well - I'm pretty sure it's all gone to waste as I'm 99% sure I've been scammed out of my hard earned cash.

I purchased the laptop on the 14th January, I then paid $2160.00 exactly ($1910 for the item, $150 for shipping) the same day through PayPal. Soon enough, a tracking number from USPS popped up (CJxxxUS) and an estimated delivery date arrived. 24th-30th January. 

The guy I purchased it off had a reasonably good feedback rating (90%+), had done 76 successful trades before me (not just small priced items, but iPods, tablets &amp; other laptops), and was located in CA, U.S. It seemed pretty trustworthy. That's a long way from me - I'm in New Zealand. 

After the tracking number appeared, things started to get fishy. It never showed any updates, either on eBay or on USPS's website - in fact, all it said was:

&gt;*The U.S. Postal Service was electronically notified by the shipper on January 15, 2013 to expect your package for mailing. This does not indicate receipt by the USPS or the actual mailing date. Delivery status information will be provided if / when available. Information, if available, is updated periodically throughout the day. Please check again later.*

So, it didn't look like it had been shipped at all (and it still hasn't shown any progress). I sent an email off to the seller a few days later asking him whether he had shipped the laptop. He said yes. ""Okay, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt"". 

A few days after that, his feedback rating drops. A negative has been posted on his page, by another person who also purchased a MacBook off of him. It stated: ""*Never shipped the laptop, I had to request refund. Do not buy.*"". So I send another email off to him asking him to explain the situation, and he gives me a reply to the effect of ""I have shipped your laptop, the other guy [who placed the negative feedback] was an asshole"". Fine. The est. delivery date hasn't arrived yet so it could've just been a one off. Still no progress on the tracking number. 

Eventually - 3 days ago, it was the 24th. Estimated delivery has started. Laptop hasn't arrived, no tracking updates. Now - here I am typing this, after discovering a few hours ago, another feedback has been placed on his page, neutral this time, regarding another MacBook from another buyer, who said ""*The guy is a liar. Never shipped my item either, but lied and said he did.*"". I sent him off another more strongly worded email to him a few hours ago, asking him to explain or refund me the money. I haven't yet received a reply from him... 

So, today, it's the 27th - in the middle of the delivery window. Nothing has arrived. I'm pretty pissed... I'm essentially sure this guy has scammed me and I've wasted all this time. I'm going to be without a laptop for the first few weeks of this semester at least. I paid through PayPal, so I have his name and his email address. The auction displayed an ""eBay buyer protection"" banner so I'm pretty sure I'm covered by that (not that I've actually used it before). But in general, I feel like he's wasted my fucking time, of which I have very little. 

How can I go about recouping my money? Does anyone have any suggesstions? I don't know how to proceed at this point... :(

Ebay,Received item that doesn't match seller's description (Sony PlayStation 3). My recourse?,"This is also cross-posted to /r/ps3, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/17fuys/i_won_a_60_gb_backward_compatible_ps3_received/).

I won what I believed to be a 60 gb Sony PS3. I was going for this specific model because it is backward compatible with PS2 games. However, I received PS3 model CECHK01, which is an 80 gb model that is not backward compatible with PS2 games.

I have contacted the seller with this information. He responded:

&gt; It's a 60GB? I did not know that, I was selling this for a friend so I apologize for the misinformation that I was provided. I would be happy to work something out but I obviously cannot issue a full refund as I no longer have the funds as they've been given to said friend. Tell me what you think and we can work something out. I apologize.

The first thing I see in every item's description on ebay is that the seller assumes all responsibility, so he should have looked at the model number that is on the back of each and every machine.

I stopped by Gamestop today and inquired about a trade-in. I am out $135 on this. A trade-in this week at Gamestop on this model is worth $60, plus a bonus $50. The 60 gb model I'd ideally like to have is $210 + tax there.

Should I:

* begin a Buyer Protection case? (I've never had to do one. How easy is it and what is the success rate?)

* request a partial refund and do a trade-in at Gamestop?

* something else?

**Edit: case opened**

**Edit (new message from seller):** 

&gt; I never handled the system myself. Here's what I'm going to do I'm going to relist the item as a one day auction and I'll refund you the money when it sells. Does that sound ok?

**Edit: (new message)**

&gt; You will get your money back, but I can't give a refund until I get the item back anyways.

**Edit, an update:** A case has been opened through eBay Buyer Protection. I am quite positive I will get my money back as this is pretty cut and dry. The seller has escalated the case to customer support. I attempted to open a dispute on Paypal as well, but since they and eBay are chummy, it already registered that the transaction already had a case open. In the meantime, GT5 is fun!

Ebay,My only objection to TRS policy and why it should be changed,"I think TRS is obviously a good thing for sellers and buyers but I recently noticed what I think is a fairly big problem which should be changed so that idiot buyers are filtered out more easily.

My point is that on the 5 star rating system you need an average of above (4.6)? to remain TRS and then either under 3? or 0.6% of 1 or 2 stars in DSR. This is the main problem.

We all know idiot buyers exist and you can try and minimise their impact on your feedback but sometimes there is only so much you can do vs these people. If they are determined to rate you badly there is not much you can do.

So for example, over 1 000 transactions seller A has average DSR's of 4.63 stars and 0 on all of the 1 or 2 stars, so he averages between 3 and 5 on each transaction. He is lucky enough to not have any weird people rate him badly. He is a deserved top rated seller we can agree, but he isn't the best.

Over 1 000 transactions Seller B has average DSR's of 4.91 stars, which is mostly always 4 and 5 stars but he is unfortunate enough to have 8 idiotic customers within 3-6 months who rate him badly.

Even though he has produced a higher consistent average than the first seller (which I think is far superior as he has outperformed him over a long period of time) he is in risk of losing his TRS because some people said he was terrible, even though his averages are higher.

Basically my point is, surely a person who gets high averages of 4.9+ should be better treated than a person who gets averages of 4.65~. Because we know once you are a TRS as long as you don't do something badly wrong in changing your business you are a legit seller and it seems harsh to punish people because of idiots.

I have actually seen people with 100% feedback over 1k~ transactions without TRS and high DSR because of people like this.

Ebay,So this is my ridiculous situation right now. Desperately need help/suggestions.,"So I recently sold two things together. Some spare postage stamps, and a keyboard (piano, not computer). 

I sent the stamps via recorded delivery, around xmas time &amp; they didn't arrive. Fair enough, &amp; ebay refunded the guy through the dispute process. I incorrectly presumed the funds would come out of my paypal account. ebay actually refunded him themselves with their own money.

The keyboard was sent with a courier the buyer arranged. It arrived &amp; he's claiming all sorts of faults it *did not have* when it left my care, (broken keys, slider, disk drive, etc.) Firstly, I think he might be outright lying, but the guy has started a dispute and wants a partial refund. (He is refusing to claim damage on courier's insurance) All the funds are now frozen. As a result, my Paypal account balance stands at -£140

Meanwhile, ebay want their £22 back for the stamps (which they shouldn't have paid anyway) &amp; are constantly demanding it through paypal. They are threatening to ban me regularly,&amp; have put my entire ebay account on hold. The reason they can't get it, is because they are holding my balance at -£140, when the guy only wants £60 back anyway.

I am in a constant loop, where I set up a payment &amp; tell them to get it through paypal, but they won't, because they are **withholding their own money from themselves.** If they went to my bank account direct, rather than paypal, they could have it.

I can't afford to put £162 into my paypal account so they can get their £22. (&amp; even if I could I wouldn't because it's ridiculous) What do I do?

I can't find a link to live help, &amp; there is no number I can find for eBay UK customer service. If the dispute goes on much longer I'm pretty sure I'll be banned from the site; 600+ feedback &amp; 6 years down the drain.

Ebay,"Local pickup, item not as described, how to proceed as buyer?","I won an auction for a camera from a local seller. Before bidding, I emailed about the possibility of local pickup. The reply was sure, but with cash. I didn't have a problem with that. The auction did not (still does not) have a local pickup option listed. 

I win the auction, travel about 20 minutes to the guy's house, but when he showed me the camera, it was not functional as he said it was. I politely apologized and said I could not go through with it. The guy didn't speak much English, but he understood and we parted ways. Before I left, I told him to cancel the transaction.

Now, no money has changed hands, nor has the product. What, as a buyer, should I do to protect myself from being dinged for non-payment? I have messages on eBay's system acknowledging the cash deal and a meeting address/time.

I bought a phone case on ebay a week ago and after not receiving it, I looked at the shipment tracking section.

What does that mean? Did they forward it to me or send it back to the seller? I chose USPS first class mail international as the shipping method, as I live in Europe.

Ebay,Known ebay fraud supported by paypal corporate processes. Can't contact anyone with the power to actually address the issue.,"Ive been trying to get someone at paypal to do something about this but it seems like it's impossible to contact anyone with any power to do anything.

Basically I brought an electronic item that was listed as originating from my city in Australia. When I received the item it was defective and I opened a claim in paypal. 

They resolved the claim in my favour and asked me to ship the item back to the seller, except now it turns out they're in China! It's going to cost over $150 to send the item back to them. So I call the paypal call centre and talk to them for an hour (after spending 1.5 hours on hold) they basically tell me they can't do anything, that I have to send the item to China despite the fact the seller lied about their location... then the call centre supervisor goes on to say that she's seen this before and basically paypal/ebay does nothing about it and I just have to suck it up.

So I write an email ""attn: complaints officer"" as the call centre supervisor recommends it as my only course of action. I get a patronizing reply this morning that basically amounts to ""we understand this must be frustrating for you, but we're not going to do anything about it"".

I fruitlessly searched the paypal site looking for a way to contact someone other than the same call centre.. it seems impossible to do anything about this. I'm not even super worried about getting my money back, I just want someone to do something about this loophole in their system that makes buyers take a much greater risk than they are aware of when buying things on Ebay.

Ebay,So ebay screwed me over with dsr,"So here are my DSRs.


item as described 1.34% (next month it would be down to .7)
shipping time (.4)
shipping price (0)
communication (.6)

They perm banned my seller account ""because it was not profitable for them"" and I received, wait for it!!!  1 low communication DSR this month! 
which ""pushed me over the edge"" keep in mind my account was above average the month before. 

F**k eBay.
I will never sell there again.

Use amazon. Etsy. Anything else.
