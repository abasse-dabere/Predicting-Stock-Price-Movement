Ebay,Concerned about a bidder and the message I just got,"I'm selling my 980ti because I upgraded GPUs. I saw the highest bidder is a 0 feedback and I had planned to retract the bid since I feel weary of selling to zero feedback buyers when it's an expensive item. Anyway he sent me this message:

""Hi so I just wanted to let you know because the last guy I tried to buy a 980 ti off of here from went to eBay to have my bid retracted because he thought I wasn't a real user for some reason. I have a verified PayPal account and shipping address but I needed to make a new eBay account so don't be scared off the I have no reputation on here. I had a 5 star reputation on my other account but I had to delete that one.

I just don't want another bid taken away because someone thinks I'm not a real user.""

Ebay,"sold phone with eBay guaranteed price, now they're refusing to honor it","anyone know how to navigate this? 

sold my phone on ebay with a price guarantee. phone sold for $85 less than guarantee, difference to be paid by eBay coupon.  waited a week, called, they told me the coupon code would arrive that weekend.  waited another week, called back, they told me that they denied the claim because the phone was listed in excellent condition but they decided it wasn't.  

the phone was in perfect condition, and the buyer himself didn't complain or take any action at all.  told the rep this, then the rep put me on hold and gave me a new reason, that i modified the listing after it was posted.  this was true, because i lowered the shipping cost when i realized i could send the phone in a flat rate box with USPS.

at any rate, they told me this was in the terms and conditions that i agreed to, however, there were no terms and conditions for the promotion (i looked very carefully to make sure).

so i just spent an hour on hold to have a rep tell me there was nothing he could do. his supervisor also said, ""there's nothing i can do, can i help you with anything else?""

i'm frustrated because it feels like they're using nebulous ""terms and conditions"" against me that i never had access to, but also because i didn't do anything immoral at all (the opposite, i would argue) and it feels like they're using a technicality to screw me out of $85.

anyone been through something similar and gotten it resolved favorably?",5,5,2016-07-01,EBAY,0.067152239382267,0.9009459614753723,0.03190174698829651
Ebay,"Advice from eBay representatives resulted in negative feedback, customer service is now stonewalling us.","I am wondering if there is anyone at eBay corporate I can speak with, or anyone at eBay in general who can make a decision based on individual review rather than just based on textbook policy. We are pretty experienced sellers, so we know how to handle most situations in a way that will maintain our 100% feedback rating. This is a rather long story, but to sum it up:

I have been on the phone with eBay (low level support) all week in regards to a buyer who we suspect is trying to abuse the return system (the usual, buying of a good item and trying to return a broken one). What set this apart from most cases, was the buyer purchased multiple items, each item being rather expensive, but most importantly, each item being large and expensive to ship. I am talking, $100+ with packing materials and shipping label. We suspected from the pictures uploaded in the return claims he opened that the units being returned were not the units we sent. We messaged the buyer through eBay messaging asking if he may have gotten our 4 items mixed up with items from different sellers. His response was that he has purchased many of these items and he does't know which ones are from which sellers, but he is still looking for a refund. We figured this was cause enough to escalate the claim (usually a bad idea for a seller), because we did not want to get stuck accepting a return of a bunch of broken stuff he received from other sellers, and have to pay return shipping of several hundred dollars. So, we decided to call eBay to ask for advice. I called 3 times in a matter of 4 days, in order to ask if they could look at the email he sent us claiming he did not know who sent him what. We were desperately attempting to expedite the process of them stepping in before we had to A) bite the bullet and lose the money, or B) receive negative feedback and still lose the money. They did not look at the email, but all 3 of the ""teammates"" we talked to told us to cut communication with the buyer, do not accept the return yet and to wait until we can escalate the claim on our end. Well, the buyer just left us negative feedback for ""not responding or accepting the return"". Why eBay allows buyers to leave feedback while also advising sellers to ignore the buyers, is beyond me. It was my mistake to assume there was some sort of a magical hold placed on the feedback system during this process. 

I have been on the phone with ""upper"" support trying to explain the situation all day long and have been completely shut down. Apparently I have talked to the highest level of support regarding my issue and we have had zero luck. Every time they say they can't transfer me, they can't help me and they are going to disconnect the call, so I just call back and ask for another ""supervisor"". 

Since the feedback the buyer left was not against eBay policy (disclosing personal info, extortion, etc.), eBay will not remove it. I am really hoping I can speak with someone who is able to make decisions on a case by case basis. We just received negative feedback while following the advice of eBay customer service to the T, and now eBay has completely turned their back on us. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Ebay,Need helpWife sold a Brand new bag,"So my wife sold a new unused bag with tags  it was missing a small charm that comes with the bag usually but she didn't have.

Buyer says ""I didn't read the description, I want a partial refund or the missing part""

It was listed for less than retail because of the missing charm.

Ebay,"Buyer waited ~1 month to open return on MacBook Pro, says shipping damaged item... weeks later?","I'm a little unsure if I'm getting scammed by an experienced ebayer.

Today, nearly a month later, the buyer requested a refund saying the item was not packaged properly and the screen's corners are damaged. They said they would like a full refund or a partial refund. I'm not even sure if the corners were already bent, but I'm mostly confused as to why the buyer waited almost a month to report this... It feels like they realized the return window was closing.

I did ship with signature confirmation and insurance through USPS.

Ebay,Buyer says they paid too much and wants refund,"I just received a message from a buyer complaining about paying too much for an item they bid on and won.  

I described it as a deluxe sized sample, said specifically that it had no size listed, but included a penny for scale in the pictures (and noted this in the item details). The item sent was the exact item pictured.

I get a message today from the buyer that says basically, thanks for fast shipping, but not what I expected based on size.  They want a refund or return.  

This person also paid only after I had to open an unpaid item case.

Needless to say, it's screaming buyer's remorse to me. I do allow returns (the standard 14 days, buyer pays) but my understanding is that it didn't cover buyer's remorse?  I haven't responded yet, and not sure what to say. 

Just some other food for thought--I did look up other auctions of an identical item, and those with bids are between $8.50 and $11.50 (with free shipping and days left).  My  buyer paid $8 plus $2.45 shipping.  To me, the price seems on par with the market.

Any help is appreciated.

Ebay,Any Advanced store/listing html/css/JS guides?,"Hello /r/Ebay,

I am a currently a front-end web developer for a company that deals with a lot of eBay sales. We have a shop and 50,000+ feedback. We have decided to make it look a little more professional in-line with our dedicated websites. 

I can create a store in html/css from scratch but I was just wondering if anyone had any tutorials for advanced listings/store creation such as how to add ""add the cart"", ""buy it now"" and ""watch item"" code (id imagine JS) into listings. 

Also a big thing is what eBay syntax can be used to create a store such as getting the listings grid, feedback, categories, search bar etc.

Ive been searching for these types of tutorials but me and many others seem to have not much luck. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.",1,3,2016-07-04,EBAY,0.024611927568912506,0.9249506592750549,0.05043743923306465

Ebay,Customs Form CN22,"This isn't specific to eBay, but I figured here would be a good place to ask. I live in the UK and send items internationally.

1. Can I just add the information to the label or does it have to be set out in a certain way (like [this](https://moogento.com/wp_moo/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/UK-CN22-white.png)).
2. Does the CN22 have to be a separate form from the address label?

Ebay,"Suspicious buyer, am I getting scammed?","I sold something for about $1300 on eBay. The buyer paid right away. I notice though that the buyer has 0 feedback and created his account 7 days before he bought my item.

The part that has me worried is the PayPal payment came in from an entirely different name. The ship to address is in the name of the eBay buyer though. I'm wondering if I may be dealing with a hacked PayPal account.

I called eBay and they said everything looks fine and offered to transfer me to PayPal. PayPal says the account is fine and that as long as I ship with a tracking number I'll be fine. I asked them what would happen if it was a hacked account or stolen CC and they say that as long as I have tracking they won't pull the money back and leave me with nothing.

Will PayPal or eBay eat the cost of this if it's fraudulent? Or will they just pull the money from my account and leave me out $1300? I just have a bad feeling about the whole thing.

Ebay,Sold pretty expensive item.

When looking at the Payment Received under Pending on Paypal, it says I'm eligible for Seller Protection. I live in Florida, and they live in California...So it's not that cheap to ship this (Going to be around $150 just for shipping...).  

Anyways, it says I'm eligible for Seller Protection, and I plan on getting tracking and signature authorization. Mainly what I'm worried about are all these horror stories of buyers just doing chargebacks and getting their money back no problem from Paypal.

Ebay,"Counterfeits, refunds, and feedback etiquette","Hi /r/Ebay!

Forgive me if I'm flooding your feed with yet another story of buyer/seller disputes, but before you leave this thread, I just want to say first that after scouring the ebay forums and reading [this little blurb](http://pages.ebay.com/help/feedback/howitworks.html#should), I just couldn't find a situation that was quite like mine, so I was hoping you all could give this ebay noob a bit of advice.

The story goes like this:

1. I purchased an item (buy it now) that was listed as authentic. Price was roughly 50 - 75% of the retail price depending on colorway, but as this model was a couple years old, I didn't think much of it. To add, the seller also had 99.X% positive feedback, so I thought I was good.

2. Of course, I wasn't. While shipping was prompt (US domestic, postmarked next day), the item was undeniably a counterfeit. I did my due diligence of comparing the item with photos of the authentic model straight from its official website. Oh well, lesson learned.

3. Rather than going to the resolution center, I contacted the seller and made my case, telling him that I was going to file a return request within a couple days. He was polite in his response and was happy to provide a full refund.

4. Not sure if this is relevant, but I actually grew to like the counterfeit item so I messaged him back, asking if he would be open to a partial refund. We couldn't agree on a price.

5. In the end, I filed the return request, describing every discrepancy I could see between the item and the authentics and included the relevant photos for each of these discrepancies. The request was quickly approved, and not long after, I shipped the item back and got a full refund including shipping cost.

&amp;nbsp;

While I could just move on with my life, I feel pretty compelled to leave some feedback. Problem is, I'm not really sure what kind I should leave. From the looks of it, feedback etiquette seems like a pretty big deal, and since this is going to be the first time I won't be leaving positive feedback, I'd really like to know what you guys think would be most appropriate. Basically, are listing fakes as authentics an unforgivable offense and an automatic negative? Or would every other aspect of the transaction merit a neutral?

In case of retaliatory negative feedback, I'm also considering writing a purely factual description, maybe something like ""Counterfeit- I have photographic evidence if curious. Prompt and full refund."" Any thoughts? And thanks for reading.

&amp;nbsp;

**tl;dr** Bought a counterfeit item, obviously was not pleased. However, every other aspect of the transaction, the speed of shipping out, quickness and politeness of communication, hassle-free return-- and getting a full refund-- was a positive experience. Given all of that, what kind of feedback do you think is most appropriate?",4,3,2016-07-06,EBAY,0.03665829449892044,0.9290567636489868,0.034284938126802444

Ebay,Auctions Ending Too Close To Vacation (as a Seller),"As a relatively new/inexperienced seller, I made the mistake of listing auctions that have ended Tuesday and yesterday (Wednesday) giving me a short window to receive payment and ship the packages out.  I will be going on vacation this coming Monday, and hopefully, I'll have everything completed by then.

Now, if everyone pays on time, I can get all the packages out on or before the day I leave for vacation.  If bidders don't pay on time, I'm assuming I'd have to open an unpaid item case with eBay after 48 hours, correct?  Then the bidder has 4 days to pay.  The problem is that 2 days + 4 days = 6 days from the end of the auction, which means I'd already be on vacation by then.

Now, here's my plan.  I just want some advice on whether this is a good plan, and whether there are other alternatives I should consider.

If I have to open unpaid item cases, giving the buyers 4 days to pay, and they pay after I leave, I was thinking that I could pack up the unpaid items, print shipping labels, and leave them for my roommates (which I trust) to drop off at the PO (which is not far away) after I receive payment while I'm gone.

Ebay,Got charged 5 x $2 - paypal chargeback settlement fees by the same buyer,"**The title is supposed to say 5 x $20** NOT $2, that was a mistype and my bad

----------------------------------------------

Buyer bought 5 games from me separately on eBay, I ship them to his address, he somehow opens the package, takes it to the post office and tells them to return it to the sender, and now here's how the [tracking looks](http://i.imgur.com/hwPCP97.png)

[Chargeback fee/refund](http://imgur.com/NdQR4k6)

According to the resolution center, I didn't meet seller protection rules so I lost the case, even though the package was shipped through ebay/paypal to his confirmed paypal address, except he took it to the post office (as said in a ebay message) and returned it after opening it and changing his mind. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/uwBWggi.png)

The buyer literally told me through ebay that he opened it and changing his mind, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if he just took the games and returned a empty package. Anyways, he filed a chargeback for each of the 5 transactions and because he managed to get usps to send back a item that's already been delivered and opened, I lost the chargeback. I was charged a $20 paypal settlement chargeback fee for each of the 5 transactions, totaling $100. This doesn't even include shipping fees, ebay fees, and any product loss.

Is there anything I can do for anyone that experienced a problem similar to this? I didn't even know you could take a item back to the post office to return it using the same tracking number/label after it's already been delivered AND opened. I've been selling on ebay for many years and have never had a case like this. 

Edit: I have tried calling PayPal, and since paypal/ebay became separate companies, paypal isn't able to look at ebay's messages and buyers messaging on ebay is moot since they don't look at evidence that way (or at least in previous experience). I am going to call again tomorrow to see what they can do. The buyer never filed for return or a case on ebay, they just went straight to calling credit card company and doing a chargeback as unauthorized payment which results in a $20 settlement fee if the case is lost. Since the tracking shows it being returned, I lost the case",11,10,2016-07-08,EBAY,0.1861182004213333,0.7898224592208862,0.024059386923909187

Ebay,The things we do for a positive feedback,"I'm not a power seller by any stretch... I go through periods where I'm clearing out things from my collection of books, games, and movies so I'll have 30-40 listings up about once a year.

I'm down to the last few listings.  Someone just bought one of my items, which had a buy it now of $7.99 and First Class shipping of $2.60.

I forgot to print the label from eBay while I was at work, and I don't have a printer at home.  Okay, I figured, I'll use the post office kiosk... I'll probably pay about 50c extra and miss the eBay discount, but that's okay, it's worth it to make sure the package ships out on time before Sunday.

I package the item (a softcover book) in one of my last remaining padded envelopes and walk down to the kiosk.  I go through the whole checkout process and pay for the postage which came out to about 2 bucks.  ""That's weird"", I thought.  ""Was expecting closer to $3.  Whatever""  Bought the postage, slapped it on my package and was about to drop it in the mail.

Then I notice there's no tracking number.  It's then I realize that tracking must not come standard on First Class, except maybe through eBay's label printing.

I go back to the kiosk and see if I can buy tracking as an add-on or something.  Nope.  At this point, the post office had been closed for about 20 minutes, I just missed them.  So I'm stuck with the kiosk.

I go through the postage buying screens again to see if I missed an option to add tracking.  I didn't.  It just isn't possible.

So now I'm looking at this package in my hand, I've spent 20 minutes on this errand as it is, getting down to the post office, waiting in line for the kiosk, and printing the postage.

I breathe a heavy sigh and know it won't look good if I ship it without tracking.  I figure hey, I've sold over 30 items last month without a hitch, surely this would be no different... but that just isn't how it works, is it?  30 successful transactions doesn't mean anything for this particular item and this particular buyer.  Maybe they'll be having a bad day.  Maybe the unthinkable happens and the package gets lost without tracking and never reaches them.  Maybe it reaches them but they lie and say it didn't.  Whatever the odds are, I have to do my best to make sure none of those scenarios happen.  I have perfect feedback and I'm not laying it on the line for a $8 item.

I go back to my place.  I cut open the package and put the book in my now officially last envelope.  I throw the package, some scissors, and tape into my bag and trek down to the city library so I can use  their printer.

After almost an hour, I now have my package with the eBay USPS label with tracking and can ship the damn thing.

I will make about $3.50 on this item after paying for postage twice and spending nearly an hour on shipping it.

All of this could have been avoided, obviously.  But I also could have given up much earlier in the day and just shipped it without tracking, and I refused.

Ebay,"Refund on Ebay, How Does it Affect Paypal?","Hi there! Recently I had one person who wanted a refund for an item that ""didn't work"" (after he had a month to use the thing). Just to not deal with anymore hassle, I just accepted a return request and he's supposed to send me back the item by next week.

Now here's where I'm a bit confused. Obviously I haven't refunded the guy yet because I still haven't received the item he's supposed to return to me. When I opened my Paypal account today to conduct business with another person, I found a red colored notice that stated I was lacking funds (I normally empty my Paypal account once I get paid) and the amount was for the item the guy was supposed to return to me (and the guy's name was there). Since I didn't want any Paypal problems getting in the way of business, I just instantly reloaded my Paypal account with the money it was asking for and the red notice was gone. 

The question is, what was that all about? Was it some kind of Ebay's way of getting the refund money from me, or did I just actually refund the guy his money? I'm pretty sure that for refunds, I have to actually do it via the Ebay interface right? I certainly don't want to end up refunding the guy twice!

Ebay,Am I being blackmailed?,"Hello fellow redditors,

I recently sold an expensive vr headset on eBay, the buyer, who recieved the brand new, unopened headset, before the scheduled delivery date stated by eBay is now trying some seriously shady moves. 

The buyer, prior to receiving the delivery confirmation, decided to purchase plane tickets to America to pick up the item due to the urgency nature of his requiring the headset. I advised him not to do that until I have confirmed the delivery date however, he proceeded to buy the tickets before hearing back from me. After a lot of work on my part I managed to arrange for delivery to happen while he was visiting the states, and fortunately he did email me to confirm he collected the new unopened device from the delivery address.

 I then requested the buyer not to open the device in case there were any issues for a return, however he proceeded to open the device and has use the device now for the past month he has just had the product.

Shortly after the sale, he contacted me asking for a 10% return on the money he paid for the hardware because of the inconvenience he went through, however he received the device earlier than the stated delivery date on eBay and there was no problems with the device as it was brand-new and he confirmed he has now opened and tested it.

He has now said to me that if I do not give him a discount he will have to file a complaint with PayPal buyer protection system, and while I do not believe he has a leg to stand on, it would cause a lot of difficulty and I'm sure he would subsequently leave a terrible review for me on eBay, even though I bent over backwards to make sure he got his device early. 

Has anyone else found themselves in a situation like this or does anyone have any advice as to how I can handle this so I don't get a bad review on eBay?

Ebay,Leaving negative feedback for incompetent seller who cancels order.,"I bought a console and received a message from the seller saying one of the game boxes was empty.  I was annoying, but said it's ok because it was still a good deal.  An hour later, the seller said they weren't supposed to sell the console after all and cancelled my order.  I know people make mistakes, but I'm definitely pissed off enough to leave negative feedback.   

I sell daily on eBay and I would never cancel someone's transaction short of a huge setback, like a house fire.  Maybe it's expecting too much to hold everyone to my standard, but there really is no room on eBay for sellers who don't take it seriously.  This person has no feedback as a seller, so my negative feedback would probably kill their chances of selling again.  

What do you think?  I realize that at the very least I should wait a few days so I'm not angry while leaving feedback, and that's what I will do.  But the question is whether or not this warrants negative feedback?  And in case you're wondering they weren't rude and they did apologize, if that means anything.

Ebay,Buyer wants to return a software item purchased 28 day ago..,"So I sold Lord of the Rings battle for middle earth 2 for PC at 50.00 on june 17, and now is requesting a return saying ""I purchased this game for a friend and it turns out the software doesn't work on his computer"" and since he chose ""product doesnt work, defective"" I have to pay the return shipping. My question is this: If I dont respond and approve his return request, what will happen on my end?"" I have never had a bullshitting buyer do this to me. He has 1 feedback (me being the only one) I think he is lying about this and just played the game and beat it over the past 28 days. 

Edit: Called ebay to explain the reason for return was not valid, as he even states theres nothing wrong with the software, just isn't compatible with his friends system. Ebay sided with the buyer, saying I didn't put the system compatibility in the description. So I have no choice but to accept the return, pay the return shipping, and pray he actually returns the entire thing.
Follow up question: If he doesn't return the entire thing, say he keeps the manual with the CD-key for example, what power do I have in that situation? Do I still have to issue a full refund?",18,5,2016-07-15,EBAY,0.03682663291692734,0.9255795478820801,0.037593774497509

Ebay,"Freight issues, late delivery &amp; damage. I need some perspective on dealing with a customer that took delivery of a freighted item.","Customer purchased an as-is for parts large printer. Customer and I spent days trying to find a cheap freight price including him posting on uship. He finally says screw it on the 5th day of looking and agrees to go with the cheapest we could find through a broker. Estimated freight time of 6 days after pick-up. I try to have him book it but he is fed up with the whole thing so I end up booking it. This is 5 days (3 business) since he agreed to buy. He pays and I immediately book freight telling him that it will need to ship next Monday (4 business days away, listing states a 5 business day handling allowance on freight).  This is because I need to move the item to a freight handler I use near my town. He says that is fine, thanks me for making arrangements. I drop it off to the warehouse strapped to a pallet and wrapped. This is where it starts going south. Freight sub contractor fails to pick up the item by the scheduled time. Took two phone calls to the broker and carrier but it's finally picked up 3 days later. Buyer isn't happy. Then the item sits in a trailer in a terminal for 2 weeks while no one can tell me why it hasn't moved. Finally it makes it near him and the final sub contracted carrier. This is where we learn that his rural area is only serviced once a week, Fridays. So it sits another week. It takes 23 days to get to him. He's been pissed since day 6. 

Before it even shows up he's threatening to leave negative unless I refund half the shipping.

Delivery day arrives. Hours after taking delivery he claims damage. Says it showed up with no pallet. I ask for pics and yeah it's been banged up. Lid hinge damaged. The important parts work but now he's asking for compensation for damage. I can't fathom the abuse it took to break free from the pallet. More importantly I can't fathom why he didn't report or record the abuse before taking delivery. Even as I stated multiple times that it was palletized he just assumed I shipped his printer with a bit of wrap and cardboard. He ignores the terms and his responsibilities as cosigner on the Bill of Lading when taking delivery.  So the carrier is giving me grief on the claim because it was signed off with no damage recorded and they're telling me maybe he dropped it or something. Now I'm trying to fight them for compensation on a delivery time that is beyond reasonable since no acts of god seems to have occurred to justify it.

I'm not happy and the buyer sure isn't. I want to make this guy happy but he has been angry and demanding. He thwarted me on the damage claim and just says I'll get negative without compensation for the damage and delay. I can't justify refunding half the freight when I did everything I was required to do on my end. I had the shipment secured and available for pickup for the appointed time. I can't control how long it takes beyond setting up some contracted guarantee and the buyer never stated it needed to be there in x amount of time. He had the same info I had when we decided on the brokered rate. How should I handle the damage claim? It may take weeks to resolve through the carrier and he won't wait that long. Should I refund some of his freight? Thank you for any input.",4,4,2016-07-15,EBAY,0.1114315390586853,0.8588662147521973,0.02970227785408497

Ebay,Help me set the record straight on CAN to US conversions when freelancing (I'm new to this),"Hi r/ebay,

I have done a bit of research on the topic but I would like to finally set the record straight here. I am trying to sell some work that I have done through eBay and paypal. I am a Canadian who would like to sell my products in USD, but obviously convert them eventually back to CAD.

**Some things I have heard so far:**
-there is a 2.5% conversion rate through paypal to do this. Do some of you just wear this fee?

-it never helps to sell in CAD to the US, because the buyers might not notice that the price is in CAD and would just see the higher number

-I can get a USD account from my bank? (I'm with Scotia).

Ebay,Need advice on possible negative feedback from buyer not reading listing !,"Hi, so I just sold a CPU for a computer on ebay, the buyer today has messaged me asking. ""where a cooling system is that should be included in my listing"" , but my listing never mentioned a cooling system being included at any point. 


The title mentions only a CPU, the listing pictures are all of a CPU in its transparent package only, the description only mentions a CPU so I dont know where they got this idea from.

On top of this the buyer has also expressed concern with my postage indicating it was late and overly expensive,  but my postage price was clearly listed with the price, and it was so high due to the cost of insurance for the product. Also the item was sent for delivery 3 days late as the buyer failed to pay for 3 days.

I fear that this buyer will simply leave me negative feedback because they failed to read the listing and pay in a timly manner, through no fault of my own !! is there anything I can do or whats your best advice for contacting the buyer?

Ebay,Not as described returns problem.,"So I sold a Miltary vest on ebay for £30 + £5 delivery, After a couple of days, the buyer requested a refund as his item was 'not genuine' even though it is a niche item, unlikely to be copied and had tags inside, his reason was that 'it didn't feel genuine' .

I asked what made him think it wasn't genuine immediately, but received no response, happy to accept a return, I accepted it anyway however discovered that I must pay all initial and return postage fees.

 I attempted to resolve this by saying that I would accept if he paid the return postage and again received no response. The returns page said that the postage would automatically be deducted out my account if I didn't pay, so today I paid the returns postage anyway. 

He then replied after 7 days almost instantly as I accepted it 'wrong again :-)' 

It's not much money but it's a third of the price of the item I have lost, is there anyway to make a dispute with eBay once I receive the item back showing Tags or have I screwed up and must accept the loss?

Ebay,HELP! RARE SITUATION! PayPal &amp; eBay are illegally withholding my funds due to a system glitch. I don't know what to do.,"**Solved: Tyvm for the help everyone. I submitted an application with FOS Australia (Financial Ombudsman) and even although I couldn't find eBay listed as a company within Australia (Hm.. I'm not sure why, as it should be registered here too) I managed to link the application with PayPal. Attached all my screenshots, emails etc. They pretty much took it from there. Two weeks later I receive my first ever correspondence from PayPal saying that they fixed the issue and that my funds are now available and that they have incl a courtesy $50 for my trouble. Pah. Still amidst getting the rest of my money back, as the glitch ate up some of my other eBay earnings due to being in the negative. But at least my initial problem is solved. Thanks again!**

I've been having a consistent problem with PayPal/eBay since the 27th of May. A man purchased a watch from me, opened the case for a refund, decided he didn't want the refund anymore so closed the case. During this time PayPal held my funds in preparation for the mans refund, however, open closure of the refund case they should have released the funds again.  PayPal insist that the case is still open yet eBay irrefutably deny this, saying it is 100% closed. 

I spent 8 hours on the phone between the both companies, written 5 letters, twenty emails and spoken to 10 representatives, 3 supervisors and 2 managers in total. I've also had 3 conference calls between two representatives/managers from each company bartering over my situation. The situation remains the same: eBay insist that the case is closed and therefore the funds should be released on PayPal, however, PayPal insist that they haven't received a 'closed' status and still see the case as open on their screens, therefore cannot release the funds until this glitch is solved.  
  
Both parties have admitted to some system error or glitch specifically on my account. Even although eBay have forward this dilemma to the technical team, re-opening and closing the case did not work nor did deleting it. They have been rather consistent with their updates and such, trying their best to solve any technical fault on their side whilst insisting that PayPal can indeed release the funds manually and that they are trying to work with them to achieve this.    
  
It's illegal to withhold money entitled to a person and that is exactly what is happening. I could contact a small claims court, but I have no idea on how that'd work given that I am situated in Australia. I also have no idea on how I can effectively pass my letter onto higher management, I can only send this via 'contact us' forms and such where the average representative will reply with the same liners and rhetoric. It never gets passed above to people who could actually change my situation.
  
  
**TL;DR: Sold an item on eBay. Customer opened a case as he wanted a refund, then decided he didn't want one anymore so closed the case. Money is still held on PayPal as they say eBay haven't closed the case. However eBay state the case is closed and PayPal should be able to release funds.

Ebay,"Buyers Address Undeliverable ""Recipient not located at address provided.""","I just mailed out an exspensive item to a buyers confirmed Paypal address.

If the buyer files an ""Item not recieved"" claim will ebay still hold them responsible for shipping charges? I am going to have to pay return shipping now to get the item back.

Ebay,Looking for an accounting software that syncs with ebay/paypal sales to automate bookkeeping.,"Hi all.

I'm looking for an accounting software (cheaper the better) that can automatically (daily or whatever) import my ebay sales and calculate my fees, expenses, taxes and cost of goods sold...

I know there is outright and xero but they only work with USD (if i'm not mistaken): I'm a french ebay seller so I need it to work with euros.

I'm also willing to create my own spreadsheet so would there be some sort of google sheets add-on that could do this? Or possibly with Zapier or IFTTT?

Ebay,Buyer wants a refund on a phone because they didn't check the carrier,"I sold a S4 straight talk phone (Title was Samsung Galaxy S4 SGH-S970G - 16GB - Black Mist (Straight Talk) Smartphone) a week or so ago to a buyer that is now requesting a refund. The comment was the following: ""I ask for a return because I cant activated the cellphone in any other carriers I though was unlocked But the phone cant even unlock."" 

I did not have anything in the listing saying it was unlocked, and I also stated that I do not offer refunds. I was hoping to get some unbiased feedback on how I should move forward. I personally don't think that lack of research on the buyers part requires me to accept the refund, but I am worried about escalation and ebay taking the buyer's side. 

Should I stand my ground and continue to reject the refund, or is it easier to eat the shipping costs back and try to resell?

Ebay,Russian seller disappears,"Hi

I'm not a native english speaker so I apologized for any mistakes. So, on April 1 I bought a watercolour set from a seller in Russia. I need to say the delivery date camp was and is null until this day.  I have bought a few things from sellers in Korea, Japan and China, and never had any problem with it. But, until this day my package hasn't even arrived to my country. I contacted the seller on May, he asked me to be patient, which I was, but on July 2 I contacted ebay. First they asked me to contact the seller, which I did, but he didn't answer to several of my mails, one day he sent a mail saying he had trouble with his internet connection, and saying he didn't kow anything about the package, he adjuncted a copy of the postal office and nothing else. I asked him to offered me a solution, until this day there's no even a word from him. Today I found ebay won't refund me because the item is not cover by the ebay buyer protection. I suspect the cause is the time that has passed since I bought it, cause I paid it through Paypal. So, I don't know what to do next, I need to say I won the money to buy my paintings through a PTC, and it took me months,  I don't have money to buy another set, I'm in tears right now, it's not fair to be robbed like this and I need these paintings. Now, I have the option to appeal the decision, but I don't know how to do it, what should I tell them if I should fill the ic3. gov report, or what should I do. By the way, I live in Colombia, the seller is from Russia.

My item is not as described! Ask why it is not as described and ask for photo proof. If it is described that way or shown in the pictures you are covered, so make the phone call.  

Ship high value items with Fedex. I pay Fedex to package these items which has never been more than $40 and it prevents the most common scam; I received an empty box. I have developed a relationship with the manager at my local Fedex who looks at everything that I bring in for a final check before it goes out. This verifies condition as well along with what is included. For example, shipping a $2700 DSLR only cost me 12 dollars for peace of mind packaging. 

Ebay is effective in dealing and helping with returns if you pick up the phone and CALL THEM. This can take multiple times to get a competent rep who is able to make decisions.

90% of the time, buyers will give you the information that you need to fight the return. This information can be used to end the return with a rep over the phone. For example, buyer states he received a item that does not work after 3 weeks of having it. Ask what the buyer has tried to make it work and what exactly is it doing. More often than not, the buyer will not even respond and if they do, they won't answer the questions.

If the buyer does not respond or has altered the item from its original state, (i.e. I opened up the laptop to look at the motherboard) then you will win the return in your favor. Items cannot be altered from their original state. You have to call to get this one closed. For example, the buyer opens a return and states ""it doesn't work"" If the item was insured, which it should be, then you need more information to determine whether it was from shipping. If they do not cooperate or do not respond, then call ebay and tell them you have to have this information from the buyer.

If the buyer does respond and say it worked when they got it, but now it doesn't. Then you will also win the return as the ebay guarantee is not a warranty service and any competent rep will close the return in your favor over the phone.

Selling something used? Paypal and Ebay both do not investigate cases of a scratches on used items. These do not qualify for money back due to the fact that used items are expected to show wear unless you say in the listing it is perfect. 

My item was damaged in shipping! Okay, I will need you to make sure you have all of the packaging for inspection as Fedex and USPS both require it for insurance. This requires cooperation from the buyer. For example, once I sold a countertop oven to a scammer and shipped it Fedex insured. She claimed that the oven was ""all dented up and the door was crooked."" I opened a Fedex insurance claim who went to her house to pick up the packing and the item and she had thrown away the packaging and refused to let Fedex take the item for a damage claim. They sent me letter that she refused the insurance at the door. I called ebay and the return was closed immediately in my favor. According to what I was told, ""Buyers have to cooperate with insurance as it is part of the transaction."" Always insure items over $200, and never use USPS insurance, choose Shipcover instead.

USPS insurance is one of the biggest jokes out there. I sent a ring through the Global Shipping Program with an appraisal wrapped around the ring box inside the package. It was insured through USPS insurance. Supposedly, the box arrived with only the appraisal and no ring or ring box. I filed a claim through USPS insurance, which was denied as the Global Shipping Center threw away the packaging instead of returning it to me. USPS requires the packaging in all claims otherwise it WILL be denied. I called ebay and explained how I packaged it and what I found out from insurance. They refunded the buyer and gave me the money back for the ring. This only happened as the Global Shipping Center is ebay's responsibility, not mine. 

A couple of things you can do to protect yourself from fraudulent returns. Take high resolution photos from all angles clearly showing the condition and the SERIAL NUMBERS. Do not list something as used if you cannot fully test it out. List it as parts and list what you can test and what you cant test and the last time you know of that it was working fully. 

I cannot stress this last point enough. The returns system on ebay is totally automated. If you think you will get out of fraudulent returns by typing messages in the return, you are wrong. It will always side with the buyer. This is why you must call. My longest call was 3.5 hours (6 different people) over a 450 dollar return which I ended up not having to take.

Global shipping program returns. Items sold through the global shipping program can be returned, but it is very difficult for the buyer and this is why. I am a US seller which means that I cannot go buy postage from the UK or wherever for an item to get back to me. If a buyer wants to return an item, the return will prompt you to state that you cannot provide a label and then the buyer must pay for their own shipping back. Import charges and duties are not refunded by ebay once you take the return, so be sure to mention that to the buyer. I have only taken 1 return back from out of the country. 

Now, I am writing these tips to help you be a better seller and let you knwo that no matter what anyone says, Ebay does not always side with the buyer. I have taken returns because the buyer was honest, not a pain, I made a mistake etc. These are done a case by case basis. I never do partial refunds under any circumstances once a return is opened. Once buyers click open a return, they either keep the item or send it back in full that is the only option I provide. 

I am sure that I am leaving some out and will edit this post later for more information. I hope this proves helpful.",10,16,2016-07-23,EBAY,0.055121514946222305,0.8968845903873444,0.04799391981214285

Ebay,Bought an item and seller is being horrible. Need help,"So roughly 2 weeks ago I bought a drone off a company on eBay. It said it was shipping from California and that it would take about a week to arrive.

After a few days passed I checked the tracking ID and it said only a label was created and that its in New Jersey. A week goes by and the tracking ID says the same thing so I message the seller.

They tell me that they decided to take a risk and ship it from their China location and that my package is stuck in customs.

So at this point I was kind of done with the whole sale because I like to only buy from within the states so I asked for a refund.

They accepted my refund but obviously they'll only give it to me when I ship the drone back. But it's been 2 weeks and the tracking ID still says it's sitting in New Jersey.

Ebay,I'm not really familiar with sending invoices. Could this sale be a scam?,"I do custom artwork and sell it on eBay. A few months ago I decided to sell internationally and have been doing so no problem. I always offer free shipping on my items, and sense eBay handles the international shipping, I only pay the cost to send it to their center. I've had many sales like this and never had a problem.

However, tonight I received a notice that an item had sold to a buy in Mexico (I'm based in the US.) He sent a message requesting an invoice.

Now, I don't know how eBay handles the shipping charges for international buyers, especially if my item is listed as free shipping.

In the invoice, there was a section to put in shipping fee charged to the buyer. Normally I pay about $3.50 to ship the item to eBay's center. I have no idea if I'll be shipping to the center or directly to the buyer, so I don't know whether or not to charge shipping. Shipping would be about half the item price.

So if I enter no shipping (the item is $40USD) then the buyer pays that. But if I wind up having to eat the cost of shipping to Mexico, then I have no idea what to do.

I don't understand invoices and rarely have to deal with them. I thought when a buyer bought an auction, they had to pay then and there.

The user has a feedback score of 6, joined June 11, 2016, and have over 50 positive feedback, most of which were left by one seller (and it was written like an add for their shop.)

I call eBay support at the end of June to make sure there was no error and they said they see I'm enrolled in the June promo but that it can take some time to apply the credit and to give it a few weeks. Then I called again a few weeks later (today) because my auto-payment occurs on the 30th of the month and I didn't want $275 deducted from my account. They are now telling me that it takes 30 days after the promotion ends to apply the credit. Again, this wouldn't be the end of the world IF THEY GAVE ME MY MONEY BACK. But they won't. They are now telling me that the credit will apply towards future transactions on eBay, not to the transactions I actually did in June. It would take me more than two years to sell enough on eBay to recoup the $225 I'm owed.
 
This was an absolutely misleading promotion, designed around the power seller who transacts a ton on eBay every month, not around the casual eBay user. I have since deactivated all methods of payment from my PayPal account since eBay won't allow me to close my account with an outstanding balance. 
 
This is not the first time eBay has done something shady but it's the final straw on my acceptance of this horrible, horrible platform in my life. I encourage anyone else who is experienceing this similarly to follow suit. EBay used to be a great place. Now they are unscrupulous and rely on wordplay to dupe people into paying more money.",14,2,2016-07-26,EBAY,0.026367852464318275,0.9296553134918213,0.04397681728005409

Ebay,US eBay representatives lie and spread misinformation,"I was speaking to an eBay representative from the United States today and they blatantly lied to me about how to proceed with an eBay case.


Background Info:
Buyer purchased a working cell phone.  Messages me and opens a case saying the power button is missing and doesn't charge properly.  I know the power button was on the phone when I sent it so I message the buyer and they admit that the phone had a power button but they don't know what happened to it.  eBay tells me not to worry and accept a return, and if they damaged it etc they will cover me.  I do so, and the buyer returns the phone and it's clearly been dropped and missing the button so I call customer service and they tell me that I need to issue a refund so that I can begin the appeal.  After I issue a refund, they state that theres nothing they can do.  I call a different representative and they said that if I voluntarily refund, I can't appeal.  They also said that if I accept the return, I can't do anything about it if I get a damaged or different item.  

I didn't really care, just wanted to see how eBay treats sellers if they actually listen to them.  This item was worth about $70 (I paid $30) and I can still sell it for $55 directly through PayPal to a repeat-buyer.  

Anyways, I reported the representative for misinformation since it pisses me off and they are going to look into offering me a $60 FVF credit (its equivalent to cash for me anyways). 

Hope you guys learn from my experience - don't always trust US representatives (I constantly see them praised here).",31,16,2016-07-27,EBAY,0.032863862812519073,0.9304466247558594,0.03668949380517006

Ebay,I think my account got hacked,"I've been an eBay user for years now. I've sold stuff off and on for a long time. A few days ago I made a listing for the first time in what must be 1-2 years.

Obviously, someone got on my account and made this listings. (Also something curious is that one of the Apple devices is listed under ""clothing"" which might imply some sort of foreign hacker not knowing what they were doing). 


Anyway, should I just end/delete these listings, change my password and move on? Or should I contact eBay and do something else?

Ebay,"The ""Vehicle Compatibility"" tool for vntg car &amp; truck parts is horribly designed. Is there a mod or extension to fix it?","Hello, We've been selling on Ebay for 14 years. I've heard of web browser extensions or tools (sounds like game mods, actually) for Ebay that can help streamline and personalize how someone lists on Ebay.

My main issue is the ""Compatibility"" tool for Ebay Motors &gt; parts &amp; accessories, specifically vintage stuff. Let's say I've got an accessory mirror for every single car between 1929 and 1939. Every. Single. Make of car. And I want it to show up in search results when someone types in the year and make of their car with the word ""mirror"". The Compatibility tool acts as an extended title for extra keywords related to the year, make and model of a car. However, the interface for it is horrible. If I want to select every single car in the 1930s, I have the click every single make (that's fine) that I want, then select the models (which the tool does NOT list models by year), and THEN select the years.

The problem with this is that by selecting the models first, where I do not know what models are in what year, I just click ""All Models"", which selects every single model for those cars, EVERY ONE, made from the turn of the century to 2016. NOW I have to narrow down the years, which means scrolling through and individually clicking EVERY single year for EVERY single model for EVERY single make of car that I want between 1929 and 1939, all while ignoring the thousands of models after 1939 up to 2016.

It'd be much easier if I could do it in this order: Select the makes, then type in a RANGE of years (1929-1939) and the tool would automatically narrow it to only the models in those years, and then I just click ""Select All"" for those models in those years. Except Ebay refuses to design their tool that way.

Seriously, try going into the Ebay motors &gt; vntg parts &amp; accessories &gt; mirrors category and try to use the Compatibility tool to select every General Motors make of car between 1932 and 1939. It takes forever.

Is there an addon that will let me select the makes, enter in a range of years and then select the models for those years, in that order? Thanks for the advice.",4,4,2016-07-28,EBAY,0.03381414711475372,0.9336799383163452,0.03250594064593315

Ebay,100% Poitive Rating ruined! (And thanks for reading long question),"I've been a 100% feedback seller since 2003...I believe my total sales top $75,000. Also big eBay shopper. I listed a $6.10 lipstick I'd just received as a ""bonus gift"" from a Dept store. It was brand new and sealed.

I noted the Buyer had joined in June of 2016, had only purchased a few cheap items from China, and left no feedback except mine. This was a $6.10 item with free shipping--so basically no income but what the heck. I immediately refunded the purchase and wrote a very friendly and polite message apologizing for the damaged item, but asked, since it was factory sealed, if she could provide more info....had it melted in transit?, etc. I welcomed her to eBay as a new member and explained that most sellers were happy to address such issues if contacted via messages or even through the resolution center. I also explained that eBay feedback is generally meant to reflect poor customer service, etc., that her feedback had extremely negative ramifications regarding my standing and reputation as Seller, and asked that she please consider reconsidering her feedback since she was probably not aware. Never heard a word back. Contacted eBay, got an international rep, calmly and politely explained the situation and asked about my options (may I now ""officially"" request feedback removal?).

Ebay,Tips for when you call Paypal for case issues.,"Tip #1: Slam 0 on your phone forever until the automated voice gives up and forces you to a rep. Takes pretty long with Paypal compared to other services. About 30 seconds, and 10+ failed notifications. 

Tip #2 Case issue or Chargeback issue? Simply say that to the first rep you get. Don't explain anything, don't tell them your life story. The moment they hear those keywords you will most likely be directed to a different department only to repeat yourself. 

Thats it. The second rep is probably who you want to talk to and 30 seconds of slamming 0 constantly over and over again will force a rep to pick up.

Ebay,Dealing with insane seller on ebay. Way to find out if funds are being held?,"I had the poor misfortune of living in the same city as a nutcase who I bought something from.  Here's the thing, I bought two things off them and asked if we could meet in person since we are in the same city.  They got really sketched out about it and threaten to cancel the transaction.  I plead with them to hear me out (he asks me why my paypal transactions have two different names.  I tell him that can't be possible and basically he goes ""oh it's okay now"" (tf?)).  

To make a long story short this guy doesn't seem to understand how human beings communicate.  Just reading his messages it's full of mispellings and weird punctuations, like something your racist grandpa would forward you.  Not to mention after we failed to meet up I told him to ship it to me and he couldn't even do that.  He attempted to mail my package and mispelled my street name.  He literally mispelled his own name unless Willim is a name...I honestly believe he has mental issues.  After I tell him to cancel the damn thing he goes ""no I'm coming to your place right now and dropping it off"", this after telling me his computer crashed and he lost my information...

So my question now is, I want nothing to do with this guy and want him to disappear from my damn life already but he's now claiming I need to tell ebay that I received it because he never got his money even though it's deducted from my paypal (weird tidbit the pp transaction is listed as N/A).  Thing is the guy has at least 68 feedback if I recall correctly so why would funds be held unless ebay does that for idle seller accounts?  At this point what is my due dilligence, should I call ebay customer support to at least verify that I received it and that if they are in fact holding the funds to release them?  

Sorry about the life story I just want you to know what kind of person I'm dealing with.  He's threatening to call the police (previously threatened legal action if I tried to back out of the deal).

Ebay,My experience with eBay hackers,"Hello there. This is the first time I'm actually writing a post like this so please understand.  
  
I am a student at University and I have only recently come back. One of the first things my mum tells me is that she has had a delivery of a MSI GTX 980 Ti Graphics Card. Now, I may be a gamer, but I already have a brand new Graphics Card and my brother doesnt live here anymore...and she doesnt even know how to use eBay so it definitely couldnt have been her.
  
The weirdest part of all of this is that she was charged for it, it was delivered to her address, yet she didnt actually purchase it. If you do a quick search for the product, you can see that it varies between £250 and £400, but she was charged £557.94 (£4.99 P&amp;P).  
In addition to this, a review was left on the product, definitely not in the format that I had ever used (I was always the one who did them).  
  
[Name of Seller (hover over to see)](/s ""scancomputers_int"")
  
    I am not sure if I am allowed to put the sellers name in this post, so I have put it in a spoiler tag (remove it if Im not allowed).  
  
I have now contacted eBay and they are looking into it, checked with PayPal and it wasnt paid through our account (but it was paid on a Guest Account). 
  
  
I just wanted to provide this story of my (and my mums) experience",2,2,2016-07-30,EBAY,0.024002011865377426,0.9320549368858337,0.04394311457872391

Ebay,Is Winning a Bid Then Not Paying Common Now?,"I use to sell on eBay quite a bit about 4-5 years ago and RARELY came across issues.  My items would sell, I would receive payment nearly instantly, I would ship the item, and it was very simple.  

I had some things to sell, so two weeks ago I listed 4 items.  Two of them went easy, as for the other 2, one never paid or responded to any messages, and the other messaged saying he doesn't want it because he found another one for cheaper, and therefore wouldn't pay.
 
Last week I listed 2 more items, and I had another no response, no pay issue.  So out of 6 items ""sold"", only 3 actually did.  I'm just curious if this is a common thing now, as it never use to be, or if I just got unlucky that only half of my items ""sold"" went as planned.",3,2,2016-07-31,EBAY,0.032983750104904175,0.9044336080551147,0.06258268654346466
