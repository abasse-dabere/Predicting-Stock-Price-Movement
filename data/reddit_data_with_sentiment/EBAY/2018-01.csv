I opened a claim with paypal asking for the $6 back.   It was escalated by PayPal and the seller didn't respond to it.   So Paypal issued me a full $40 refund. haha

Ebay,Restricting Buyers to PayPal Only?,"Up until now, I've had my buyer restrictions locked down to the maximum on all settings. One of those settings is ""sell only to buyers with a PayPal account"". We'll, I've checked the report that lists automatically blocked sellers, and it turns out that I've missed quite a few sales/bids because of this.

So I guess I have a three questions:

1. If I don't restrict selling to PayPal only, I don't have to deal with any other hassle right? I'm still going to get paid into my PayPal account and it doesn't really affect how I do business in any way? Or...do I have to actively deal with other payment forms? 

2. Those who have changed their settings on this item, did it make any sort of difference in your return rate or anything else?

3. I know it's impossible to really know, but how likely is it that I really didn't want those sales anyway?

Anyway, the buyer received it on the 27th, and then proceeded to immediately request a return at my expense, a full refund, and he left negative feedback that same day.  He was *furious* that the item was listed as ""used,"" but arrived new, and yes, you are reading this correctly.  His negative feedback stated his problem with the condition, as well as he thought I ""overcharged"" for shipping (it cost $13.59 to ship), and the he didn‚Äôt get it in time for Christmas (I list 3 day handling time, and Parcel Select is a 2-8 business day service).

Ebay,Envelope Issues - #10's Keep Getting Torn By USPS,"To start, I purchased them at Staples and ran them all through my printer to print my logo and return address.

I'm getting a few buyers messaging me saying that the envelopes get holes torn in them; one buyer nearly lost his product because of the hole--another buyer messaged me today and actually did lose product because of a hole.

Granted, for the buyer who lost items I really stuffed the envelope to the edges. I can always use a larger envelope for that specific item (like a 9x6).

I'm wondering if anyone has had an issue like this and if so:


* Do you think it's because I overstuffed the envelope that it tore?
* Do you guys ever send stuff in plain #10 envelopes, or should I just steer clear and order bulk bubble padded poly mailers? I'm almost out of the #10s, and I'm wondering if I should make this switch. My issue would be the weight of the envelope at that point since I typically only need to use 1 Forever Stamp. I'm currently messaging a seller about the weight for a 9x10 bubble poly envelope.

Ebay,How to handle customer who only sent me half of the product in return?,"Hey guys, so I need some advice on a customer I'm dealing with right now. This customer bought an item from me that comes with 2 parts. One of the parts arrived broken, likely from shipping. They really wanted me to just send them a replacement for the one that broke, but that's not an option as I only had that one...

I had to explain to them several times that an exchange was not possible, but if they were to send me back both items I could give them a full refund. 

After some resistance they opened an INAD return and sent it back. It wasn't until 3 days after they shipped the item that they sent me a message today saying that they only included the broken part because they wanted to keep the one that works still and they asked me to not refund them but rather send them a replacement once I get the item back.

Obviously that can't happen, and I have no idea what to do or tell them... I don't want to give them a full refund without getting both items back, but I already lost $25+ on return shipping for the bulky item and I definitely don't want to have to pay another $25+ dollars because of *their* incompetency just to get the other item back... I also feel a bit bad about just calling eBay and telling them I didn't get the full item back because then they won't get a refund or their item back &amp; I definitely don't want a negative...

Ebay,eBays website vs PC and iPad,"So I am having some problems right now that has led me to overpay on products that I could have otherwise gotten cheaper.

Whenever I use eBay on my iPad application I seem to get all the listings for products with no issues at all, however when I use it at my PC or on Safari on the iPad (because I need a link to the listing in question) they don't seem to show up ....they will show up under my ""recently viewed"" but they will not show up under the general search, instead it gives me expensive ones or ones from China only.

I thought it might have to do with my country, as it's still default set to Australia on the preferences, but it's not on the iPad (I can change it there easily with no issues). I've tried countless times to change my address on eBay to USA ( I moved here) but it seems to not let me, so eBay is filtering out things that say ""won't ship to Australia"" for the Website versions.

I have tried to contact them but they told me to go to the preferences and change it, but when I do I can't select any states from the USA, it still lists Australian states.

What is really annoying out of this is I bought something for $25 when I could have bought the exact thing for $11 inside the USA as the listing was not showing up when I was doing it on my PC.

I also use eBay to buy stuff for my family who live in Australia for Christmas gifts, I am worried now that if I change my country to America I am not going to see any listings that mail inside of Australia.

Should I just suck it up and make a separate account for USA? I really don't want to as I have a high buyer feedback on my current one.",4,3,2018-01-04,EBAY,0.03142550215125084,0.9319351315498352,0.03663938120007515

Ebay,Question about taxes/deductions for ebay business?,"So I've been a seller for several years and am considering turning into a full-time business. I know what I need to do, and have already begun to take the steps necessary to do it, but I've come across a couple questions in the last few days that I think you guys may be able to help me with:

* Both my husband and I have ebay accounts, but we have only used his a handful of times over the years. If I go full-time I plan to keep my account as the business account (resale), and his account the hobby selling account (our own items from our home that won't make profit). He will not be participating in the business as he has his own full-time job. Are there any problems with doing this either ebay-wise or tax-wise?

* Also, when it comes to taxes, I know I can claim expenses for deductions. My question is this- if I purchase inventory or supplies with my husband's ebay/paypal account that only has his name on it, can I still claim it for my business expense since we're married, or since the business is technically under my name on my account, do I have make sure all expenses clearly specify my name only?

Ebay,Question about feedback for this situation,"I bought a guitar from a seller with a 265 / 100% positive feedback score.

Ebay,Anything I can do for a really rough negative for something minor?,"Hey so I don't sell that many items quantity wise so this negative really affects me... Maybe someone could offer me advice.

So I sold a used item recently and I guess it was missing a protective case that doesn't affect the overall usage of the item I didn't know it was supposed to come with (even though I never said it did come with it, but fair enough from his perspective I also never said it didn't come with it). 

I apologized, was really nice and told him I would pay for shipping and refund him or give him a partial ($5) for a replacement case as well as a link to where he could buy it on eBay. He said he just wanted to return it, and everything seemed fine. I got the return and refunded him the day I got the item back. Well I look today and he left me this negative

&gt;DO NOT BUY FROM [my username]! sold me misleading product! BEWARE!

I feel like that is totally overreacting for the situation at hand. I messaged him and I think he thinks I tried to scam him, but he outsmarted me... I wouldn't be a very good scammer if I offered him to pay for return shipping the second I got a message from him saying something was wrong. 

It can be so frustrating when you try to be nice and make everything right out of your own pocket and you still get a negative... Especially over not including a $5 part I never said it included in the first place! I thought I would be nice and offer a return to avoid the trouble and the negative, but now that I got one anyways, I figure I should have at least tried to fight it, because maybe a rep would agree that this isn't INAD since I never stated it would come with it.

Any way I can fight this? I feel eBay won't remove it because he technically isn't wrong I admitted guilt when I offered to pay return shipping... I'm afraid people will read this and think I'm a scammer and won't want to buy from me. It would really suck if this affected my business...

Ebay,"Listing advertised ""Fast &amp; Free"", but seller didn't ship the item until the estimated delivery date","Last week I bought an item, this was a generic item (less than ten quid) so there were many listings, but I specifically choose a ""Fast &amp; Free"" listing that was supposed to be sent by Royal Mail 1st Class Delivery. I bought it on Wednesday afternoon, so if it was sent on Thursday it would have arrived on Friday or Saturday, which was the delivery estimate on eBay. I wanted it to arrive by Saturday, as on Sunday I left the country to work abroad for a couple of months.

On Saturday morning (around 3am) I got a message saying the item had been shipped, and it didn't turn up on that day, so here I am without the item. If I knew the seller was just messing me about, I would have purchased the item from another seller or Amazon Prime to ensure I would have received it in time. Now I'm going to have to purchase it again and pay for international delivery, so I'm really out of pocket here.

So what to do? I messaged the seller and they just sent a generic message ""if it doesn't arrive in 3-5 days we'll send a refund"" (with much worse English).",5,6,2018-01-08,EBAY,0.0837496966123581,0.8753485679626465,0.040901727974414825

This evening I decided to look at completed listings and found something odd. The same item has been listed numerous times at the same amount using the same images. These are all from different sellers: https://imgur.com/a/wLHuP https://imgur.com/a/vpQ0g

Ebay,"The plot thickens. Seller who requested ""refund"" after she sold fake item to me claims eBay is on her side.","Please check posting history for the full details but, tldr: I bought a dress that was listed as authentic from a seller who later admitted it was fake after I called her out on it.  She immediately refunded me without providing a return label.  I donated the item to a friend (she knew it was fake and didn't care) but several weeks later the seller messaged me demanding I either find the item and send it back to her or ""give her a partial refund"" for the amount she might be able to sell the item for ($70.)  She since relisted it, admitting it is counterfeit.

Well, more has happened.

I reported the incident to eBay harassment (knock wood, she hasn't threatened me, just sent lots of annoying messages asking for money.)  I've spoken with eBay service on the phone at LEAST four times now and all of the people have told me I'm under no obligation to track down the item or send her anything.  One rep even said ""please do not send her any money.""  **It's also my understanding that it would be illegal for me to mail this item to the seller since that would make me complicit in the sale/trafficking of counterfeit goods.  (Correct me if I am wrong.)**

Multiple eBay reps said they were ""launching an investigation"" into this seller's behavior, but judging by the tone of her messages, nothing has actually happened, or if it has, she hasn't been made aware.

Well, eBay walked me through ""blocking"" this seller but because we have a transaction in our history she is still messaging me.  Her latest message says that she ""got eBay involved in this"" and then she goes on to say that ""eBay says you need to return the item to me or give me a partial refund.  Sorry to do this but it's the only fair way to fix this issue.""

I called eBay.  They still retain that I don't need to do anything.  I asked them if there is some way to stop the messages and they vaguely said ""she won't message you again"" although to my knowledge they didn't actually put any blocks in place.  I asked them if it was true that they had ""gotten involved"" and taken her side and they said there is no way for them to know if she's called them.  They also said there is no way for them to contact her to tell her their decision about me not having to return the item. (Seriously?  A major company has no way of contacting a customer to tell them to quit harassing someone?)

So am I just destined to sit around receiving annoying messages from this seller forever?

My friend who I donated the dress to told me that if it would end the anxiety for me, she'd send it to the seller (if I or the seller paid for shipping) however, I don't want either of us to go to jail or get in trouble for breaking the law.

Ebay,"Ebay, the scammer's paradise","I have been selling on Ebay for years and am used to their illogical case resolution decisions. But until now I felt as long as I posted on time and had a tracking number I should have some protection- not anymore. I sold an item through Ebay Australia which was bought by a buyer in France on the 28th of November. I posted it on the 30th of November with registration and signature delivery. Average postage time is 2-3 weeks (as described in the listing). On the 15th of December the buyer opened a case saying the item hadn't been received. I explained that around Christmas the post offices may be a bit slower and hopefully it will arrive soon and I submitted the tracking number. On December 24th the buyer escalated the case and the next day Ebay kindly broke the news to me on Christmas that they decided to refund the buyer. I used an online tracking website and could see that the item was still in transit. From previous experience I know that Ebay will not change a decision unless the tracking number shows it has been delivered so I waited and checked the tracking number every few days. 2 days ago I checked and noticed that it arrived on January 4th. I emailed the buyer asking for payment but got no reply. So yesterday I called Ebay Australia customer support and they checked and could see that it had indeed arrived but said they couldn't do anything and would need to contact Ebay France. They tried to contact Ebay France but said the office was currently closed. They told me to call back the next day when they would hopefully be open. I called back later and was told this time that I would need to email Ebay France. He said he would generate an email that I could reply to and explain the details. I did this and received a reply from Ebay France the next day; I will include the relevant parts below -

We are happy to assist you further. However, as you agreed upon the terms and conditions in the French language, we are only able to offer you assistance in French.Should you have trouble understanding the message below, you could ask a friend or a colleague to translate or you could consult an online translation service that, although not 100% accurate, may serve as reference.

    Puis sur ""soumettre une contestation"" √† droite √©galement.

This seemed kind of bullshit to me. I mean when did I agree to terms and conditions in French? It was sold through Ebay Australia. Oh well, using an online translator I figured out how to appeal the case as they instructed through the French Ebay website earlier today. After only a few hours I get an email from Ebay- 

My name is Soline and I am contacting you about the claim n¬∞*********, which you appealed the decision. I am sorry this sale did not go as smoothly as expected, and I wish to assist you in the best possible way.

I wish to tell you that, given your great selling performance, this mere incident does not question the quality of your work.

I have thoroughly studied this case, and I am afraid I have to confirm the decision which was previously made.

It is correct the item is marked as delivered on January the 4th. 2017. Nevertheless, the first decision is correct. At the time the case was filled, the tracking informations showed there was no parcel movement since more than 10 days. According to eBay rules, the item got considered as lost in transit.

You can check those informations on this website with the tracking number RR********** : https://t.17track.net/pt?nums=RR**********

My advise to you is to fill a complaint with the Post office in order to clarify what happened.

I remain at your disposal for any clarification.

 Since you joined our community in 2002, you have been an involved and exemplary member. I hope you won't get discouraged by this experience, and that we shall meet again on eBay.

I wish you a nice day, as well as the best luck on eBay in the future.

Best regards,

 Soline R. 

eBay France Customer Service

So in summary, it now seems to be Ebay's policy to refund the buyer if the tracking shows that the item is more than 10 days late. And because at the time that ""decision is correct"", they will not overturn the decision even if you can prove that it has since been delivered. 

If anyone has any advice I'm happy to hear it. I have been scammed through Ebay numerous times in the past, but at least I was always able to find some way of learning from the experience and doing things differently from then on. In this case it really is sad to know that in all likelihood I will lose over $100 to someone who is abusing the Ebay refunds system. And Ebay's capricious policies mean that as a seller, even if you do nothing wrong and pay extra for tracking and signature delivery you will lose your time, money and item if there are postal delays and the buyer opens a case and escalates.

I might be reading your initial message wrong but it seemed rather inappropriate for the tone i set in my initial attempt to contact you.The first pics i sent were taken right after i tried to install the bearing and something didn't seem right, so i removed it and immediately took pictures to compare both the old and new one,it was still dirty from the install at that time. as you can see in the second pictures after i wiped it off it was not 100% proof of user error during installation as stated in your email. Like i said before i was trying to be courteous to you to make sure you were aware of this before i mention it in my review, because if the bearing broke during shipping or during packaging than it not a well made part in my opinion. i didn't think there was a way to remedy this since sending me a replacement bearing is useless at this point and i don't think a partial reimbursement is realistic either. But i am rather upset since you have rudely stated that i broke it and then mock me when i said i cleaned it up and insist on treating me like if i'm trying to scam you when in reality i just didn't want to leave a bad review over something so trivial. the correct way to address this would have been to offer a replacement part, witch i would have denied since i'm already done with the install. After you could have reassured me that you would look into future packaging processes to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else. But no blaming me and upsetting a customer is totally fine.

It states the seller is based in the uk and postage was 6 pounds apparently which means he must of lied about the location.

Ebay,Help! Young eBay seller not sure about my tax obligations,"Hi r/ebay!
Thank you all for all the informative and useful posts this past year!

Upon google research to no avail, the time has come for me to ask my own question!

I am currently a 19yr old college student, i work part time and sell on eBay to make some side cash. I don't do an enormous amount of sales per year, or generate any kind of sustainable income but I do make some money doing it. This year, my numbers are: Transactions (last 12 months)251
Sales (last 12 months)$4,734.72

Nothing crazy, BUT I'm wondering, do I owe taxes on my sales? 
I read on the eBay forums that you must exceed 200 Transactions AND have over $20,000 in sales before you have to fill out a special form to pay your proper income tax. I've also read that even if you don't hit the 20k mark for sales, if you sold over 200 it's still report able income and ebay/paypal will still end records of your sales to the IRS.

I don't want to get in any trouble here, and I'm perfectly ready to pay my taxes if they're owed. Can someone PLEASE clarify all this for me?

Ebay,[Question] Are there any actual ways to prevent the buyer switch scam?,"Hi everyone, 

After reading many articles, I found out the frustrating truth (?) that eBay/PayPal would never listen to the seller and will always side with the buyer. 

If I sold, let's say a $3000 gamer computer on eBay, the buyer could simply receive it, open a non-conformity claim and send me back a brick. And I would have nothing to prove myself right? Since they don't accept any kind of proof. 

So the only way is not to use PayPal but wire transfers, but then no buyer would want to take the risk. So everything is just so broken...

Ebay,Getting messed around by a seller over a transaction he's attempting to cancel,"Hi all,

I've got a bit of an annoying situation here that I was hoping for some advice about.

On Jan 3rd I hit BIN on a 1970s guitar effects pedal listed by a private seller. It was priced lower than usual - about half the price, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It's not uncommon for sellers to underprice stuff like this because it usually means there's an underlying electrical problem or something that they'd rather not disclose, which I can usually fix in no time.

I paid the price of 145 euros (+ 15 shipping costs) immediately with PayPal and got a quick follow-up message from the seller confirming that he'd ship the item the following day.

Later that evening I received another message where the seller explained in his broken English that he'd made a ""mistake"" about the price and would cancel my order. I was mildly disappointed because I haven't experienced this before but I was just happy that when it did happen, it happened over a particular model that I wasn't that desperate for. After turning down his 'generous' offer to sell it to me for a much higher price, I just asked for my money back.

This guy's Italian and on top of the language barrier, he isn't all that sharp either. We're at day #11 and I've still not received my money back (and he's since relisted and seemingly sold his item to someone else by now).


Here's the relevant excerpt of our exchange that highlights the problem:

&gt; Seller: ""I have not connected my bank account to my PayPal account ... but I have connected my credit card ... in 1 to 2 days the money should arrive on the card .. if you give me the paypal data I will do it a charge of 160 euros ..""

&gt; Me: ""My PayPal address is [removed]. You're going to have to send the payment as a gift, or cover the fees yourself, because I don't want to lose money over this.""

&gt; Seller: ""do not worry she will not have to pay anything.""


In short - the seller managed to fail at this and sent the money as a payment owed (or something) which has burned me on PP and currency exchange fees. It's not a great deal of money, but I really don't want to lose ¬£17.13 because of a dirty seller. I pointed this out to him and attached screenshots from my PP of the money I paid vs what I received, and got no response. I probed him again a couple of days later, and got the following response just now:

&gt; ""listen [glynomes] I refunded your money but you still want money from me .. I give you an advice to close it here because if you open a dispute would be a waste of time for a few euros is not worth it .. and I have a good lawyer. . good day""


I've felt pretty confident about this so far because of eBay/PP's notorious bias towards buyers, but I'd still like to play my cards properly. A PayPal dispute is the logical move here I assume?

Ebay,New buyer here. Need some advice about a return...,"Bought something.

I think it's a counterfeit but can't prove it.

I asked for a return.

Seller agreed to return, but asked me to pay for return shipping.

That's all fine.

But here's my question: Seller just gave me an address and said I should ship it there. But ebay has't offered to generate a shipping label for me. Isn't that how it's supposed to work? I want to use an ebay-generated shipping label -- not just mail it -- so it's all in the system. 

I don't want the seller to get my return, say I never returned it, and cut me out of a refund.

Am I right to think this? Shouldn't ebay create a shipping label for me -- rather than me just taking item to the post office? **Does the fact I didn't get a shipping label mean that the buyer didn't actually approve the return?**",9,6,2018-01-14,EBAY,0.03440198674798012,0.9169362783432007,0.048661790788173676

Ebay,eBay payment pending?,"Hi

Ebay/PayPal query - the seller messaged me to say my PayPal payment has been pending since last week and they won‚Äôt ship the item until it clears (I can understand this).  I‚Äôve bought a lot more since this transaction and hadn‚Äôt checked it had actually cleared until they messaged (it shows on my bank statement already as out of my account so never looked at PayPal). 

Phoned PayPal who have said my money is on hold as the seller hasn‚Äôt sold anything in years only bought so I‚Äôve emailed the seller to tell them it‚Äôs an issue at their end and they‚Äôll need to contact PayPal/eBay to see what they need to do.  PayPal seemed to suggest it could take as long as 21 days for the funds to potentially clear... or the seller needs my feedback to release the payment immediately. Am sure you can understand am not happy leaving feedback until I have the actual item in my hands. 

Seller has gone awfully quiet on me since I emailed them saying it was an issue at their end (followed up with a polite email just to check what was happening but still no reply). If I don‚Äôt hear from them by midweek (estimated delivery date on the listing) I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôll have to open a case of item not received?  

I don‚Äôt mind waiting a few days longer if they‚Äôre having issues getting the funds released - would just like them to let me know what‚Äôs happening.

Ebay,eBay defended somebody that tried to scam me TWICE today.,"I'm not even sure where to start with this. 

- On the 4th on January, I bought an item. 

- The item was posted on the 5th, estimated by the 12th

- 12th came and no package, I open a ""did not receive"" case

- Today, 16th, I wake up to [ this](https://imgur.com/0Q5SGAR) showing that within 22 minutes, the seller changed the tracking number, asked to close the case (due to the package being delivered) and eBay ruled in his favour.

- After contacting Royal Mail, the original tracking number had the wrong address written on it. Two digits of the post code were in the wrong order. 

- The new tracking number leads to a place 157km from my address, and wasn't sent until the day I opened the dispute, the 12th. 

After phoning up eBay and explaining all of this, they finally ruled in my favour and I got my refund. I asked to have the account investigated because, lets be real here, this scammer tried to steal my money, and got damn close thanks to eBay not checking tracking numbers. I was told to leave negative feedback and the account will be ""noted"" in case any further incidents happen. 

I left this [feedback](https://imgur.com/nzXiKZm) which adheres to eBays own rules [here](https://imgur.com/OsqS3Di).

After asking me to revise the feedback, which I refused as It was accurate, he contacted eBay and appealed my feedback. eBay sided with him and removed it as ""It could effect his ability to sell in the future"".

So, his account is now back to a squeaky clean 100% rating and, while I have my money back, I've wasted 12 days waiting for a package that won't come, and now needs to be replaced at a further time loss, and several hours of talking on the phone to eBay support staff that seem not to care what evidence exists. 

eBay don't even seem to keep tracking numbers as a record. Once he switched it, I couldn't find the old number anywhere else on the website. I had to look at the PayPal transaction which, thankfully, does track when tracking numbers are changed. 

I don't know what else to say really. I just feel powerless. eBay seem smitten with this seller.

Ebay,Customer says the shoes were defective as they did not fit his usual size (?),"A customer recently purchased some shoes from me, I sent him a Uk size 7, he rang me up a few days after and complained that he always gets a size 7 in this particular brand of shoes, but these ones didn't fit.

He then sent me this:

*""Thanks for your feedback and I appreciate your position.
However my argument is that I usually purchase a shoe size 7 (41) and they fit well. In your case size (41) did not fit as the
shoe seemed to be coming up smaller than a standard size and in order to get a shoe that did fit I had to obtain a shot size
larger than the size I normally purchase.
As such, it could be argued that the shoes you originally sent were defective because they were not actually a size (41).
Have you had any feedback of a similar nature from other purchasers of the subject footwear?

Ebay,How to proceed with buyer accusing item was sent damaged but refuses to send pictures or state what they want,"I need advice on how to proceed with this buyer. Buyer has a few thousand feedback but feedback is private which is a red flag to me. 

Buyer sent message this morning stating part of the item was broken off and that I knew this when I sent it. I responded with how I am very sorry and that damage during shipment does happen. I also requested pictures. They responded with again how I knew it was broken when I sent it and how they can‚Äôt send pictures (which is complete BS). They did not state what they want but I am assuming they are waiting for a partial refund. 

Luckily in my last 3,500 transactions, this is the first one I have gotten like this. How do you handle this situation? Do you try to reason with the person and continue to respond logically to solve the problem (which I know usually is ineffective but does work sometimes) or do I just say send it back for a full refund and stop messaging anything else?

Ebay,How to not refund postage if they chose higher service?,"I'm sure this possible but I'm not sure how to do it.

If a buyer orders some items and chooses express delivery and then decides they don't like it and opens up a return (which is fine as we accept returns) the return is showing that the refund will also include their full postage cost even if they could of chosen the free delivery option.

Ebay,Extra tasks to be doing beyond listing and sourcing,"Just wanted to talk about what extra things you guys do (whether it be everyday or one offs) to do better on ebay?

I'm at an interesting impass right now. I've surpassed some of my monthly earning goals way ahead of schedule. A few months ago I was able to quit my full time job and got a part time job working from home. Now I'm making enough to warrant quitting that job too, only issue is I don't know what I'd do with that time. I'd say listing, sourcing, shipping, and misc tasks (like answering questions) takes me 4-5 hours a day and every day I get faster as its become routine and second nature.

Sometime I finish early have 3 or 4 hours before I need to start my part time job. I've thought about quitting that job as I really dislike it, but I'm having trouble coming up with tasks to do during that extra time I'd get that would make it worthwhile. 

I would love some discussion and ideas of what else I could be doing.

Here's some I've come up with

1) starting an Instagram and/or Facebook page to post my products on (I kind of did this one a while ago, but gave up as it took a lot of work and I didn't really see any increase in sales)

2) oragnizing all my current stock, and deciding to liquidate or donate what hasn't been selling to make room for more product

3) starting a side project to work on (I have a couple ideas that might be fun)

4) lowering prices / promoting listings that just aren't selling

Ebay,What would you do under those circumstances - Got item after receiving a refund.,"So, this is the situation:

last month i ordered some clothes from the US. I am EU based. I paid immediately and the seller posted the items 2 days after trough Global Shipping Program.

I received 2 tracking numbers. One was dead for some reason and never got updates. The other worked fine.

I sent a message immediately to the seller asking why there was 2 tracking numbers when this was only 1 piece of clothing. I never got any answer from him.

Anyway, as the 2nd tracking was moving fine, i didn't think much of it until the shipment got to the Uk where it failed to deliver any updates for 15 days.

As the deadline for delivery was already past 10 days, i opened a case and asked the seller to try to check with the carrier if there was something wrong. I asked for a refund but what i really wanted was the item and i made myself clear that i would wait if i got any feedback on the item location and delivery.

Again, no answer whatsoever from the seller. Seems to me he doesn't like to talk with the buyers.

As i was left by myself i contacted 3 different parties trying to know about the whereabouts of my package. Initially, no answer was given to me and i was getting worried.

Nevertheless Ebay soon refunded me the money stating that the shipment was lost on the way. I accepted this ending and forgot about the matter for a couple of days.

The next monday, one of the carriers answered my email asking me to wait. As i had been waiting for ages, i decided to be a pain in the ass and pressure them to find the item that i thought to be lost...

Turns out, it pays off to be an ass. After 3 more days back and forth, they finally found the package and sent it to me. Took 2 more working days to get to my house.

Now, what i am asking is:

- Would you contact the seller from your own will or would you wait to see if he finally decided to dignify his buyers with a message?

If he asks me for the money i will pay. But i won't pay for the shipping. He will have to discount me the amount as it was supposed to be his job to deal with the carriers, not mine.

But as he never answered my messages or showed any willingness to help me, i am thinking about just pretending nothing happened waiting for him to make the move.

I feel like there are limits to be oblivious. The seller muted me, didn't care, ebay stepped in and refunded me. At the very least, i will wait for him to ask me for the money if he wants it.

What's your opinions on this? Am i being an ass or i have some kind of right to let him hang until and if he notices the delivery?",4,3,2018-01-18,EBAY,0.07493099570274353,0.8982722759246826,0.026796791702508926
Ebay,"[HELP PLS] Paypal closed a controversy that i won on Ebay before getting the refund, now i dont have item and money","Hope someone will help me with it or i will lost more than 500 euro.

So the 16 of the last month i buy a monitor for aboutg 550 euro, it delivered late and also badly damaged (used probably) i payed with Paypal.

So i open a controversy and won cause the seller never bother to reply and Ebay gave me the adress and payed also to deliver the monitor back to the seller.

For two days straight the monitor couldn't deliveron the tracking, either cause he was not there or didn't accept, it was late to call Ebay so i try to contact Paypal instead and here i think i made a grave mistake.

The girl on the phone working for Paypal asked me if i wanted to open a controversy and didn't mention at all the fact that the controversy on Ebay was going to get closed, she was surprised to see that after she opened the controversy for Payapal herself.

So now after the seller got the monitor back and i didn't got the refund, the controversy with Ebay is closed and i have to restart everything with Paypal, i will win the controversy with Paypal to probably, but what i'm scared of is that since i already send the item back without Paypal permission they won't care about the original tracking game me from Ebay and won't refund.

I'm really sorry for my broken english, i hope someone will be able to understand and reply to me

Ebay,"[PSA] Something wierd is going on with eBay at the moment, hold off buying or selling until it is fixed, story inside","I've had 2 instances this week of eBay not working the way it should and my housemate has also ran into a similar issue to my 2nd issue. My facebook feed is FULL of people having problems with eBay right now. Possible hack.


So the first issue is a definite bug with the website confirmed by eBay themselves, had I followed all of their advice I'd have looked like a scam artist. I sold a router that was listed with having a rack. The router was accidently shipped without the rack mount and I was unable to find it. Short version is me and the buyer agreed to partial refund. I issued the refund. I had more than enough both on my card and sat in my Paypal account to cover the amount and there were no issues but the refund ""failed"". When trying to click ""retry"" it directs me to Paypal but tries to send the details via an insecure manor (over plain http instead of https). Allowing the connection to go ahead leads me to a ""fatal error"" page. The 'retry refund' is on the eBay website itself.


This would have been fine, bugs happen I get it but their advice was to ""wait the 19 days"", leaving me without the money as it's held by eBay and leaving the buyer without his partial refund. After trying to get this resolved with no luck I eventually posted the steps to reproduce the issue to both eBay's twitter and Facebook, the posts were removed with no reply so I posted the issue to a popular eBay group that eBay does not have direct control of, about 10 minutes later I was contacted and asked to remove the post by eBay and that the issue would be resolved, it was ""fixed"" within the space of 30 minutes.



The other issue happened today when I purchased a hard drive, a few hours later I get contacted by the seller telling me his account was compromised, he was new to eBay and when I walked him through the steps to cancel it he said he was getting a message that he can't cancel it as the listing was posted from another country. I've since had my bank card cancelled and disconnected my bank account from Paypal for the time being. Speaking with eBay again I'm told there's nothing they can do as there's ""an issue with the system"". What a total shitshow.


It should be noted I've both bought and sold A LOT on eBay over the years and never ran into any such troubles.

Ebay,"Buyer returned item damaged, admits in messages that they damaged it &amp; wore it for 2 days, just got product back","tl;dl: Accepted a return, buyer admits in messages that they damaged and wore item, ships item back to me before I can call eBay. Want to know if calling eBay will close the case in my favor or if I have to refund since it was returned.

Hi everyone! I have my shop set up to automatically accept returns opened for any reason. I recently had a buyer open a return case, and it was automatically accepted. I typically don't read the case details. Later, in messages, they admit that they wore the item for 2 days, had it sewn onto their head (the item was a hairpiece), and cut off its tags.

I know that by the item condition policy, I should be covered, but I checked with the original reason for their return, and they stated in it that they had it sewn in. They didn't state the other damage.

They've left negative feedback once I mentioned that I'd have to call eBay to see what I do with the refund, and have called me a 'c&amp;nt' without the &amp;, and threatened to leave negative feedback prior to doing so. 

Hopefully I can get this resolved, but my only concern is that the item was delivered back to me. I only found out about the damage (part of the product was cut off for more comfortable wear) after the return case was accepted. 

Since the item's been delivered back to me, can I still call eBay and have the case closed in my favor and the negative feedback removed? I've never had this happen after an item was delivered back.

Ebay,Ordered 12 Ink Cartridges from ebay that dont work in any combination. Seller asked me to take pictures of my issue.,"&gt;Greetings. 
Sorry to hear that, 
Could you please tell us the printer model first ? 
Could you please send us clear pictures to show the problems? Please attach the pictures through eBay message.
Once we confirm it we will offer a better solution for you.
Looking forward to your reply soon.


&gt;Thanks for your reply! To be completely clear about my issue after further trial and error this is what happens: My officejet all in one 8600 tells me my original yellow(O.Y.) is out of ink, so I swap it with your new yellow cartridge (N.Y.C) and it says the same thing (please replace yellow cartridge, but then cyan reads as an error also) So I replace my original cyan (O.C) &amp; the (N.Y.C) only to receive the error that the second new yellow cartridge (S.N.Y.C) is depleted and it will not read my original magenta cartridge (O.M.C). So I replace the (SNYC) and my (OMC) with the third yellow cartridge (T.Y.C) and a new magenta cartridge (NMC) only to receive the error that my original black cartridge (O.B.C) is depleted as well as the (TYC). So I replace my (OBC) &amp; (TYC) with a second black cartridge (S.B.C.) &amp; my (OY) only to receive the error that the new cyan cartridge (NCC) is depleted as well as the yellow again. **I tried many many different combinations with almost all 12 of the cartridges and I still cannot print AT ALL, with any combination of the 12 cartridges. I hope you understand you're asking me to take 256 pictures of each combination of installed cartridges as well as 256 pictures of every error message. Sir, do you really expect me to take 512 pictures? I have no idea how I'd get that much data to you over ebay or any other file hosting platform?? My pictures average a file size of 5MB times 512 is 2.5GB.**


WTF... and guess where I got the set of cart's I'm attempting to replace? The same store. I figured shit, these knockoffs didnt last long, but the first set actually worked.

Ebay,PSA: hold ebay accountable for chinese crap sellers pulling crap on you,"over the years i've purchased using taobao, aliexpress and ebay.  
now i only use ebay because the prices are more competitive  
and ebay is very generous with it's money back policies.

lately i'm getting a lot of stuff from china that is clearly not as described, dysfunctional, shipped the wrong item, or after a month nothing arrived - in every case i filed a return request, clearly describing the situation, photographs of what i received, etc and so far got a prompt paypal refund often as the sellers neglect to even bother contesting the return.  other chinese sellers will offer you a 20% refund on your purchase - this is also automated, they didn't actually read what went wrong, they simply canned respond in hopes of avoiding a full refund.

I'm guessing chinese see it as part of doing business now - it's not worth having an english reader/writer on staff or outsource for the 1:20 buyers of $10 crap that goes terribly wrong - so if the crap you ordered arrives wrong in some definable way, don't hesitate to file for a return even though you know it ain't worth sending back to china.

pro tips: if your return is denied - click the appeal button.  often denials are computerized while appeals are always human reviewed - so if your claim has clearly documented merit, always appeal.  i NEVER leave negative feedback (i got a refund, so why be a dick about it) so if you want to warn other potential buyers - leave NEUTRAL feedback and a why, that way other english buyers will notice it, while the chinese seller won't care as it does not impact his score.  always do a seperate lookup of the same item limited to North America (chinese crap sellers will list the item hundreds of times as cheaper in order to keep you from ever seeing the domestic sellers listing) for a few dollars more you will get faster shipping and more reliable order filling (even though it's the same chinese crap sellers - using a domestic agent).  if you are offered a partial refund without any return options - and don't want it - don't respond, just let the clock run out on your return request and you will get the full refund from ebay anyway.  btw don't worry about ebay banning you for occasional returns like amazon fulfillment may - ebay is just an escrow holder so the main loser is the seller.

if you are a chinese crap seller, here's a pro tip for you too:  stop offering widely different items in the same listing - it only ends up confusing your own english illiterate low wage picker packers into sending the wrong item.  options in the same listing should be reserved for modifiers like size or color at the same price - not  closely related products at widely different prices.  we know it's your clever attempt at getting people to notice your listing when they sort by price (we're not that stupid) but you only shoot yourselves in the foot in the long run.  *the classic example of this is for android tv boxes - they'll list the box from the title, then options will include the box alone, the box plus an additional remote, then the remote separately, and since the remote is $10 while the box(which already comes with a basic remote) is $50, you'll notice this listing first hoping you might get a $50 tv box for $10 .  another scam is to lowball the tv box with an EU power adapter, then when you select the US power adapter option - the price jumps up 20%*

I mailed Pitney Bowes on Monday but recieved no help other than that they are looking into it. 

Normally I would not be too worried, was it not for the fact that I work for the delivery agent Pitney Bowes uses in Norway and I see GSP packages from Erlanger dating well after mine arriving.

Ebay,"Ebay buyer scammed me &amp; left a neg, but I got my revenge","So this is a rant, because I know you guys understand.  

I just had a buyer purchased a pair of shoes from me who proceeded to:  

1. claim INAD because it doesn‚Äôt have a zipper (I had photos showing it from every angle and there was no zipper to be seen. I also had a description saying it is pull on style, which obviously means you pull it on and there‚Äôs no zipper)
2. ask me for a return on the basis of item being ‚Äútoo narrow, I cannot get my feet into them‚Äù (which I denied because 1. the item was as described, 2. their feet being too fat to fit doesn‚Äôt make the shoe itself narrow, and 3. I would be losing money otherwise)
3. leave me a negative feedback 
4. file a return request and harass me every time I replied, by accusing me of having poor ‚Äúmorals‚Äù, stealing their money, and selling a ‚Äúfalse‚Äù item


    So first of all I had many photos which showed Ebay that my item was as described. This allowed me to deny the return request, which means I got my paypal funds back (when an Ebay buyer opens a return request, the funds are automatically held from you as the seller).  


    But Ebay said that the **negative feedback INAD was allowed because it was an opinion** (total bs). The rep said just as any business could receive negative feedback from unreasonable customers, Ebay provides buyers with an open forum to complain even if they are unjustified. I politely said I understood and ended that call.  


    I then went over to look at what this ebayer was selling. Lo and behold, they're selling not 1 not 2 but 3 pairs of shoes by the same company and in that same size. So how could the shoe be ‚Äútoo narrow‚Äù and ‚Äúnot as described‚Äù if she obviously fit their fat feet into 3 different pairs?! That's a bald faced lie.  


    Called Ebay back, explained this. Now I got the negative feedback removed immediately. I also reported the user for abuse of Ebay‚Äôs return policy, for using offensive language, and for being a scammer. They had hundreds of positive reviews, 1 neutral and 0 negative. But scum like them exist on ebay. The customer service rep said this account will most likely be restricted or suspended, thank goodness. This whole process cost me hours just to deal with all of her ridiculous comments, and to contact Ebay to undo all the damage she caused etc. It sucks that these disputes are unreasonably anti-seller and pro-buyer. People like them shouldn't exist on ebay, and this was unacceptable.  


    ...But at least I won, and lived to tell the story, though I'm not sure I learned any lessons here. Next time I get a crazy buyer I'm going to have to choose between refunding them or spending all these hours with ebay cs all over again.

Ebay,Was I scammed or was it an accident?,"Hey guys, so I decided to rewrite my entire post. Because, now that I think about it - it had to be a mistake. Okay so here was my issue - the poster listed my webcam I bought as a c270, however it ended up being a c260. Most people would instantly go about and declare scam, however I went ahead and looked up the specs - both are identical. Not only were the specs identical, but also the product serial number - v-u0018. The webcam was used, so after the user used it - he naturally forgot the model of his webcam and did a quick Google search (I am assuming), the product number he typed in gave him the top search of ""c270"". After taking a quick look at the specs he saw that they matched his own, and he was careless to look at the release dates (which really were hard to find). 
Now, here I am with a older model than the c270, with identical specs. I am thinking it is a refresh, so I am not getting the short stick or anything.

Do you guys think my assumption is right? I really do not want to bother the seller if it was just a mistake - and the specs are the same anyway. However since I am not a webcam expert I am not sure, either way - the webcam was VERY cheap so I probably should not be complaining.",4,12,2018-01-27,EBAY,0.09492319822311401,0.8774536848068237,0.027623143047094345

What are my options here? I would really prefer not to do a refund because if the item was deemed lost in transit, I probably won't get the full amount of my lost due to buyer request for the item to be declared well lower than the item worth. My mistake.

Ebay,Am I the Victim of a New Scam?,"I sold 2 items for $250 each back in late December. I shipped the items to seperate buyers in completely different states via USPS with signature confirmation due to the type of item and the price.

Everything seemed fine until the middle of January, I get two INR cases opened up against me. I check the tracking for the two items:

1. The USPS tracking website states: ""Delivery status not updated"" on December 21st, and the INR case is opened January 15th

2. Tracking status states ""Item is in transit"" for over a week. At this point the estimated delivery date has long passed.

So now I have two tracking numbers that technically haven't been delivered, and two INR cases. I try to stall the customers as long as I can, stating I think the item will arrive soon. But the eBay auto-case date was closing in, so I succumbed and refunded the two customers $250 each.

Two days later, I decide to check the both tracking numbers one last time, and miraculously the packages were signed for and successfully delivered THE DAY AFTER I issued the refund! 

So the customers got the item for free, I'm out the cost of the item and shipping. The best part? The one of the buyers left me bad feedback about not receiving the item after they accepted delivery of the item. Talk about getting the shaft....

Anyone have any insight to what happened here? I'm scared to sell anything else if this is going to keep happening.

Ebay,"Listing an item on eBay with two different fee percentages, which does eBay choose for the Final Value Fee?","Hello, sorry if this has been asked before but I couldn't find anything clear on this topic.

If I list something in an applicable Comp/Tab category and a Consumer Electronics category, will eBay take a 4% or 6.15% cut?

Per eBay's page, **""For items listed in 2 categories, the final value fee is based on the fee schedule for the primary category.""**, does that mean that the first category I choose for that item will be the one they base their fee off of?

Ebay,(NC) Sold a board game on eBay for $2025 and being scammed by the buyer (NY),"Recently sold a board game to a buyer in New York for $2025. I sent him 3 boxes weighing around 38lbs. Upon receiving the boxes the buyer dumped out the original contents of two of the boxes and took 3 different pictures with different items in the two boxes and submitted them to eBay saying I sent him junk and was going to call the police. You can tell one of the boxes is the exact same because the sticker is the same but the contents are no different.

A few days later a seller on a Facebook page reported this exact same buyer for scamming him through PayPal for a similar board game expansion.

I submitted evidence of the original items that I sent the buyer, submitted eBay the other sellers PayPal case to show them that he is scamming someone else in the exact same way, called them every day discussing the matters of the case. After a month or so eBay favored with the buyer and let the buyer return the contents of the box. I never received the return.

I turned to twitter and started tweeting at eBay, AskeBay, CEO and Chairman about this case. AskeBay picked up my case I restated all of the evidence and finally eBay closed the case in my favor. eBay then banned the buyer for his fraudulent activity.

10 minutes after eBay closed the case in my favor the buyer then proceeded to open up a case with PayPal claiming the same thing and even said I gave him death threats (???). I called PayPal immediately and they said they are still going to release the funds to me but still need to follow through with formalities for an investigation.

One week later PayPal closed the case in the buyers favor. They claimed that the buyer can put a hold on the funds and will allow the buyer to return the items to me so that I can sell them. Which does not make sense because he is claiming I sent him junk and not the $2000 board game.

The buyer shipped back ‚Äúhis return‚Äù I received it this past Monday. It was one box with 2 bricks in it with a weight of 9lbs. I recorded the box before it was open, took a video of me opening it and took pictures of what I received. This obviously doesn‚Äôt even come close to what I sent him. This also doesn‚Äôt match the pictures he submitted of what he claimed I sent him.

PayPal said I could submit an appeal and have to file some sort of case with the law. So upon doing so I reported this buyer to the USPIS and the FBI. Submitted both of this documentation to PayPal submitted every single shred of evidence that this buyer is scamming from the original pictures, to other fraudulent cases from the buyer, to him being BANNED on eBay, to what he sent me. PayPal still favored with the buyer saying I sent him worthless items.

Obviously I have pursued everything I can with PayPal and I would like to know what legal action I can take next. My work offers a free legal consultation with a lawyer for 30 minutes. I would like to peruse suing the buyer for this fraud since this is a federal crime. I would like to know how possible it would be to sue PayPal for ignoring all of the evidence and not conducting a thorough investigation and siding with a buyer that is committing a federal crime.

tl:dr; PayPal is allowing a buyer to scam me despite all the evidence I have provided that proves he is a scammer. What other options do I have? I am considering suing.",90,57,2018-01-29,EBAY,0.1279979646205902,0.8466376066207886,0.025364451110363007

Ebay,Problem with auction,"Hey guys, I'm posting this just so I can get some feedback about what to do. 
First of all I need to explain I'm from Argentina. Here customs is a pain in the ass but lately they did a new reform were stuff below or 25$ (this includes shipping) can pass automatically without paying anything extra to them or the mail. To try this I placed two bids which were below one dollar and the shipping of one would cost $19 and the other $23, so I would be paying $20 for one and $24 for the other. 
I eventually won these bids but apparently they were being auctioned by the same person.
The problem is that, without asking me or me asking for it he sent both packages together. Now, this is already a problem since he charged me two different shippings for one package but this also is a problem for me, since now I have a package that's labeled to be $44 for which I would have to pay taxes to customs and the mail.
I know I'm in the right here, since he's charging me double shipping and he didn't ask about how I wanted my packages sent. There's the option to talk to the seller about combined shipping, which I didn't even take, I just paid him expecting him to do his job and send them separately or at least contact me offering combined shipping.
When I message him he just tells me ""I already sent it, friend"". The guy is chinese, but english is not my first language and I still have to abstain by the rules. 
I just sent him another mail telling him the problem again and mentioning the shipping problem but I'm sure he will respond something dismissive again. What can I do?
Thanks in advance and sorry about the bad english and long text.",15,5,2018-01-29,EBAY,0.1302080899477005,0.8306766152381897,0.0391152948141098
Ebay,Can't see watching count or promos on item pages?,"Around four to five days ago I noticed two things seem to have changed on ebay; I am wondering if anyone else is seeing this on their end. 

1) Items, either my own listings or someone else's, does not display watch count. This is making it harder to gauge interest on certain items. I know I can view this number for my own listings under Seller Hub / Listings, but prospective buyers cannot. 

2) Promotions no longer seem to appear on the listing page. It used to display ""Buy One Get One Free"" at the top of the listing if such a promotion was running, but that seems to no longer be displayed. Again, this is for my own listings as well as other sellers. 

I have tried viewing from a different browser when not signed in and I get the same results. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing? 

While I can't know for sure if the changes above are the reason, my sales over the past four to five days have dropped by 50-70% lower than average. It was a very sudden drop as well.

Ebay,Sketchy seller behavior,"Hello, I'd like to ask for some help with how to deal with this seller. I will try to explain the situation as simply as possible. 

I won an auction on Jan 15th and paid immediately. Two days later the seller messaged me and said the item would be shipping soon and they would provide tracking info asap.

On Jan 25th I get a message from eBay that the package had been shipped but no tracking info was provided. I messaged the seller to ask for it and I have received no reply from the seller.

Finally this morning I received an email from service@PayPal saying that the seller had issued me a refund for the full amount, no explanation was provided. I had intended on filing a INR claim with eBay today, should I still go ahead and do that? At this point the funds are not available for me to use in my PayPal account, should I wait to see if the refund goes through before I do anything?

The whole situation has me sketched out! I am pretty annoyed with this guy. I don't know why he won't respond to my inquiries, and why would he ship the item and then issue a refund?

Also, the item I'm selling is electronic.  I've read horror stories about people sending PS4 only to have them switched with faulty items then returned.

Ebay,Being targeted by a scammer?,"Hi, this might end up being a long post... 
I've posted on here before about the previous attempts of a scammer trying to get me to send him an item without paying. Since then I had to wait for unpaid item assistant to work and change my settings to block him. After the item finally reopened for a 3rd time it seems he keeps using other accounts to try and send me offers for the item. The first he sent an offer of about $40  more than the price and another account offering the exact price. I had another item which was a backpack, and it seems that ebay turned auction on it because it would not sell and he sent another offer a few dollars lower for it. I did not realize at the time that it could've been another account because it was a backpack and the account used was not recent(but the usernames are similarly long...) So another seller wound up messaging me about the item I originally sold to see if it had all the corresponding wires and hook ups.(I'm a little wary of this because the question seemed kinda weird to ask and worded in a way that didn't seem like they planned on responding...) I told them it had everything listed in the description and asked them if they wanted pictures of anything in particular(because I never got a chance to change some of the details in the listing) They never responded...so I sent a second message with several pics of the item outside of the box explaining that it didn't come with "" a specific cable and a certain scratch was on the item; and asked if that was okay with them. They had paid for it already but still haven't respond to my messages in about a week now... I'm very concerned about this because my item didn't have pictures of the item out of the box, failed to mention a certain cable was not included(I have an HDMI cable rather than an AV cable), and the scratch on the item. I also looked up the buyer and his address it's from the same stated as the guy trying to originally scam me... The area's are not the same but it seems suspicious. Even though I mentioned this in the message, I'm wondering if this person intends on making a claim about the item to keep it and then be refunded...

Ebay,Do I have to refund a buyer once an accurately described item has been sent out?,"So most recently I have sold an ex-display 3-way filter tap on Ebay for ¬£95.

Now I have already sent the item, payed for postage and the money I have received has already been spent towards my next holidays outing.
