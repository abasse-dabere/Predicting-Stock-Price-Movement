Ebay,"Buyer complaining about shipping price AFTER payment and packages mailed. Did I charge too much, or is he crazy?","EDIT #2: So I get a call from this clown this morning. Bad move to give him my number, I know - but this was earlier when he seemed like a civil person and had questions about packing. Anyways, he tells me he's going to open a not-as-described case and return the drums, then hangs up on me. Bear in mind they won't be delivered till Monday. I send him a message reminding him that if he intends to do this he'll have to pay return shipping. I offer to open a case to cancel the transaction, get a refund, and I'll have UPS intercept the packages and send them back to me. Saves him time and money, and I don't risk getting back broken drums. Win win. He declines, says I don't understand how not as described works, and orders me to get those boxes shipped to him like he told me... despite the fact that he told me on the phone he plans on returning them for a refund as soon as he gets them. 

No, not happening. He is not getting those drums. He's obviously trying to rip me off, and even if he does send them back there's no guarantee he wont steal or break some or all of it. He's going to leave a negative feedback no matter what happens(six feedback and already has on other items), so I took a chance. I requested UPS to intercept the packages and return to sender. Once it's confirmed they are being sent back, he's getting a refund and I'll be ~$150 in the hole. At this point, what else can I do? Unfortunately there is no guarantee UPS will intercept the packages, so he could still get them and potentially screw me over further, but it's worth a shot, right? /edit


I'd like to think I'm in the right with this, but I'm unsure where to go from here and get the feeling I could easily get screwed. 

I sold a drum kit for a friend, auction style, went for ~$800 with $200 shipping (it's a drum kit after all). Never shipped a drum kit before, was told to charge more than I would normally because of time/materials/cost. Buyer seems like a nice enough guy, gives some tips on how to pack it, then pays. Asks that I ship UPS (I always do anyways). A few days later (today), I pack up all the drums in 3 boxes, UPS picks them up and I send the buyer a message letting him know all this. He thanks me, and asks how much the shipping cost me, and less than 15 minutes later sends another message saying how he sent a kit to Norway for $122 with USPS, and gives this subtle threat:

&gt;Not to be a prick but I will get the quote once they arrive and prefer honesty from you ahead of time and was surprised that you didn't share that with me hence this heads up.

At this point, I'm really not sure what he's expecting. He saw how much I charged for shipping, and no doubt bid accordingly. He even PAID for it already.

I reply, telling him how much it cost ($127.35), and also mentioned that I paid a shipping fee to ebay and the UPS pickup fee, so my total out-of-pocket cost is $154.30. I know you aren't supposed to charge extra to compensate for fees or time, but he asked what it cost me so I gave him the numbers. I also mentioned that I spent a few hours and used my own boxes+packing materials, which I either have to buy or drive an hour to pick up. Either way, it's less than the $200 he paid. 

His response:
&gt; Gee that's terrible, your friend doesn't realize the gouging that has occurred.

Gouging?
&gt; Also UPS agent said they do not charge separately for pick up.

 I didn't say otherwise...
&gt; Who drives 2 hours for boxes.

 what does that have to do with anything?
&gt; I feel completely cheated.

 did he not see the shipping cost on the listing and bid accordingly like everyone else? 

Ok, so I know there's plenty of nutcases on ebay, but this guy already has a problem with me and hasn't even got the drums yet, and I'm afraid he might screw me over. I read some guidelines on ebay, but no set rules on how much I can charge for shipping. I wasn't trying to rip anybody off, but I've been screwed on shipping costs recently so I charged what I thought it would cost. Am I at fault for charging ""too much"" for shipping? Does this guy have a case against me if he wants to take it up with ebay? 

EDIT: So I just got off the phone with ebay. I explained the situation, asked for some clarification on the shipping price guidelines and asked if I was in the wrong. They pretty much said that if this guy has a problem just to give him a refund of the difference so he doesn't try and report me or leave negative feedback. They wouldn't really explain what would happen if I *did* get reported, though.

They do price research, wait to bid, then snipe, like a well-informed customer would. It's not uncommon to see a good lens at a low price sit in a seven-day auction with no bids and two dozen watchers, then sell at a very high price after a 45-second bidding war at the end of the auction.

Occasionally, however, a particular lens or piece of camera equipment will have a lot of bidders right at the beginning. This happens most often with items that have a value outside of the professional world. That is to say, you're more likely to see non-snipe bidding wars on items that are being pursued by amateurs and students. I believe, based on looking at completed auctions, that this actually drives the price of these items **down** because it discourages professionals from watching and then bidding on the items. The professionals see this early bidding, imagine that some wealthy amateur is going to drive the price on the item up, and the professionals decide to wait and bid on the next one.

If you are bidding on an item that has an appeal primarily to budget-conscious professionals who buy a lot of used equipment, does it make sense to place several bids early on, to create the illusion of irrational amateurs driving up the price? Will this result in fewer bidders, and therefore a lower final auction price?",8.0,5,2013-08-05,EBAY,0.047716837376356125,0.9230653047561646,0.02921782247722149

Ebay,Changing shipping to faster after item sold.,"Hello. I am relatively new to ebay (have only sold an item once and that was a long time ago), I have been using flat rate boxes but after some number crunching decided to offer first class USPS shipping, which is slower but cheaper. I wasn't thinking entirely and it turns out that after the price of the box and paying for tracking its only about a dollar difference to ship it via flat rate box. So my question is: my buyer bought the item when it said first class package and payed $3.77 for shipping, can I use a flat rate box and just pay the difference out of pocket? I know you aren't supposed to change shipping but I am giving them a faster and more expensive service (3 days with flat rate instead of 4-7 for the first class, $3.77 without box/tracking whereas the flat rate box is $5.80) and I am paying the difference.

I plan on selling small items to begin with. Books, small clothing items and accessories, etc. My only concern is with shipping costs. I looked at Australia Post's website to calculate postage and it said it would cost me about six dollars *not including packaging* to post a parcel about 10cm (~4 inches) by 20cm to another state. This is a massive charge for an item of &lt; 100 grams.

Then I was thinking about regular letters. All I have to do to send a letter is stick a stamp on it and send it off. How does that work at such a tiny cost? Could I just stick my small items in a regular letter envelope and send them with a stamp?

Ebay,"""International Priority Shipping"" - not going to buy off ebay again","I've posted a while ago that I've just bought something off ebay and I was concerned that it was being shipped internationally by PBI, Pitney Bowes.


It's been almost 2 weeks since the last package tracking update has been provided (Shipped from US Shipping Center to International Destination). I don't know how this package is going to be delivered, there's no way to find out if it's going to be shipped via the postal services, via UPS or via Fedex.


The package can't be tracked and I have no means to find out who's going to deliver it.


I've had to pay quite a large sum for the ""custom taxes to be paid to Pitney Bowes"" (70 USD) and 32 USD shipping. If you're offering PBI International Priority Shipping to your buyers, don't expect them to buy things from you.


I've tried to find a way to get in touch with ebay, but it seems they don't want you to contact them at all. Furthermore, my ""track package"" link went away and I can only view the old package tracking details from the order details.

Ebay,Received stolen phone. What steps should be taken?,"The seller listed a Galaxy S II (SGH-T989) with a ""Clean IMEI"". 

I got the phone, and it was filled with some dude's pictures and stuff. No big deal, people forget to wipe their devices all the time.

So I wipe the device, install CyanogenMod, then pop in a T-Mobile SIM card.
5/5 bars, but no connection to the service. No data, cannot call.

I check the IMEI with T-Mobile's site.

It says this:

**WARNING! Our records show that this device has been reported stolen. Unless the status changes, this device will not work on our network or on most other networks around the world.**

Great. 

Now what?

I opened a dispute with eBay, that the item was ""not as described"". Do I turn it in to the cops? Will I lose my $200? Do I wait for the seller to explain? What's he going to do? Refund me and sell the stolen phone to someone else?


The seller has 100% feedback (994), and has been a member since 2009, so no red flags jump out at me there.

**Edit**, an update:

The seller said they buy/sell lots of phones, and obviously wouldn't have purchased it if he knew it was stolen. He said he called T-Mobile when he received the phone and they told him the IMEI was clean. It's possible that in the short time that he received and sold it, it could have been reported stolen.
He said to return it and he will try to figure out who it belongs to. He told me he'll refund my money and pay for return shipping.

So, it's been mailed back.

I only sell parts that I know are fully functional and my packaging methods border on the insanely paranoid. (Bad experience with a certain **U**named **P**arcel **S**ervice)

Having just recently lost my job and exhausted all of my savings splurging on things like mortgage payments, medical bills, and living expenses for three, I began listing items at obscenely discounted prices hoping to make a quick sale.

One item I sold for $400 will usually fetch about $1000 refurbished. The one thing that struck me as odd from the beginning of the sale, was that the buyer had opted to make all of his feedback comments private. Now I'm not a power seller and I've only just recently received eBay's blessing to access my funds immediately after a sale, but this is something I've never seen before.

Regardless, the buyer payed immediately and I shipped him the package shortly after. I received delivery confirmation on July 16th and, up until today, that was that.

All seemed well until a little past 8pm tonight, when I received an email from Paypal informing me of a complaint they had received from the buyer who claimed to have never received the package he was promised. I received a message from the buyer shortly after:

&gt;Hello again,

&gt;I never did get this item in. I waited for a little bit to see if it would be delivered again but it never arrived. It shows delivered but you forgot to put signature confirmation since it was over $250 value. And since I live at a house on top of a hill I can't see how someone would just take it. I don't know why it never arrived. I checked everywhere and still nothing. I don't know what else to do so I had to file a dispute otherwise I am out my money. I am sorry for this. Please let me know if it went back to you or any other information you can give me. Again I apologize, but I can't be out all this money for an item I haven't received. And I do a lot of buying and this is my second item I never received in a couple years.

Now, I'm not sure if his 8 stars are any indication of how much buying he does, but maybe he does some of his buying from other accounts. Fair enough.

It seems like common practice to wait a month after the posted delivery date to make any indication that there is a problem right? The first thing you should do is file a dispute and *then* contact the seller about the missing package right? /s

As fishy as this may seem, I'm sure you've all heard horror stories about the unfortunate results of buyer's word against seller's word disputes on eBay and Paypal. Having long ago spent that money on bills, I almost had a heart attack.

Needless to say, the red -$416 on my Paypal account summary got my blood pumping. Whatever circumstantial evidence I could give attesting to the shady nature of this buyer and this transaction would never be enough to resolve this dispute.

I felt despair, anger and, most of all, I felt helpless. That's when it dawned on me; I vaguely remembered that the buyer had requested the package be delivered to a business address.

One quick search on google for the part number of the item along with the city and state of the address and lo and behold! 

There in the top results was a cached eBay listing for a suspiciously similar looking item that was recently sold and shipped from the same city as my buyer.

Some thug must have stolen it from him and sold it on eBay! Some thug with the same eBay user name as my buyer's email address.

Of course, no one is stupid enough to include a picture of the serial number in the listing for an item they plan  to claim vanished into thin air. No one save this genius...

Well, uploading photos to eBay removes the exif data. I guess he can just claim that *I* took those pictures before I sold him the item.

Oh wait, he uploaded them to imageshack. What's this? regex.info says the photo was taken three hours after the proof of delivery says it was delivered? Hmm. Suspicious.

I send all of the recon data I gathered to paypal in a note through the resolution center. Less than one minute later I received this:

&gt;Dear Unnaturally Attractive Male, `That's me ;)`

&gt;PayPal has concluded our investigation of the following Buyer Complaint:

&gt;REDACTED

&gt;Because the buyer has reported that the claim has been amicably resolved,
this case has been closed. 

&gt;Thank you for your cooperation with our investigation.

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;Protection Services Department

...which was immediately followed by this:

&gt;Sorry about that. My partner messed up and did the wrong **REDACTED**. We received your item. I apologize for the issue. The case has been closed and you are good. Again I apologize for the confusion. I hope we can do business in the future! So sorry!

Guy must have had a canned response ready to go to avoid any real review of the note I had left.

It makes me a little sick to think about how many people he's done this too in the past and I feel the need to give out his eBay identity if not his actually identity so that unwary sellers at least have a chance to protect themselves from this heartless opportunist. It makes me **RED** in the face. I want to **MOON** him with all of the glory of my big white ass and it's **SURPLUS** of thick black hair.

I've digressed. Had he actually been an intelligent person, I would be even more in debt, with NSF charges I can't afford, and a demolished eBay record.

Ebay,Have a case in the resolution center for an item that never shipped. The date I can escalate it to customer service is past 45 days,"From when I paid.  I am pretty sure the seller is never going to respond. 

I ordered something the beginning of July.  The item was supposed to ship within two weeks and I was supposed to receive a tracking number but never did.  It was an international shipment and the expected delivery date wasn't until August 8th.

I've contacted the buyer multiple times and never received a response so it looks like they went MIA.   I opened a case in the resolution center as soon as I was allowed to.  I've never used the resolution center and I didn't realize the seller was given a week to respond.  Which is totally fair but it's going to put me past 45 days that paypal gives you to get a refund.

So my question is am I going to be screwed here if I have to escalate it to customer service?  Or is the 45 days from when you open the case not when it escalates to Ebay customer service?",3.0,2,2013-08-08,EBAY,0.04431053623557091,0.9283581376075745,0.027331288903951645

Today it sold to someone else however I have yet to receive payment and several minutes ago received a message from the Russian person again. The message implied that the person that won the 3DS is a re-mailer and will send it to Russia (zappeastusa4). I googled zappeastusa4 to find mixed messages on whether it is reliable, with some claiming that everything went ok, while others claim that zappeastusa4 claims the payment back after several weeks if the package were to get stolen on the way from the US to Russia.

Ebay,eBay doesn't care about its sellers,"I recently sold an iPhone 4 on eBay and against my own nervous thoughts, I shipped it off to the buyer in the Ukraine. This buyer has since reported it not delivered and has been awarded a full refund while I'm out the money/phone, $25 in shipping, $26 in eBay fees and $12 in Paypal fees. Turns out there are 3 others that he's made the same claim against and been awarded refunds.

someone bought one, then they messaged me later and said ""the fob i received does not work on the kia sportage 2007 as advertised. had locksmith try to program and they stated that this is not the fob for this car.""

i told them to go to a Kia dealership, and asked if the vehicle had keyless entry (as I knew base model Sportage doesn't have keyless).  I also said ""I'd be happy to send a refund and return shipping if you're unable to get it work."", which hindsight says I should have worded differently.

well, the vehicle doesn't have keyless entry.  i said ""will fit any Kia with this style fob"", and this vehicle never had this style fob.  i don't want to be a jerk and refuse to refund because of a technicality, but i don't feel like i should be obligated to refund for an item that doesn't work because of something on her end.

Ebay,"Difficult buyer who will return abroad by the time the item is delivered, any advice?","Hello, so I have a difficult buyer and I need some advice. Thanks in advance. I sold an item on Ebay on Thursday, the buyer promptly completed payment the same day. I shipped the item the very next day, on Friday morning, to the domestic address that the buyer provided (I don't do international shipping, only American). I get a tracking number and insure the package.

Then I get a message from buyer AFTER I already shipped the thing stating that the buyer is going to return to his home country on Tuesday, is never coming back, and could I upgrade the shipping so that he receives it before he leaves the country. I tell him that I already shipped the item and the estimated delivery date is actually Friday- so obviously too late, he'll be gone back home by the time the package arrives at the temporary American address he provided when he purchased it. 

Buyer then sends back a message asking if he can just return it. I  point out that my return policy is that I DON'T accept returns, either. 

Buyer sends another message stating that he doesn't know anybody in the US because he was only here for a temporary stay. So not only will he not be in the country to accept the package when it arrives, but he doesn't know anyone who could accept it either and so what to do?

I did have my return address on the box. I'm willing to buck my no-return policy in this very annoying instance. I sent him a message asking him if he had an apartment superintendent or manager or whoever might handle the mail deliveries at his apartment complex, who could just write ""Return to Sender"" on the box when it arrives and USPS will just send it back to me. I told him once I get the package back (however long that might take), I'll send him a refund, but that I can't refund him until I get the package back in my hands. He hasn't replied yet.

Was this the right thing to do? USPS WILL return to sender if the recipient is no longer at the address, right...? Even if he can't find someone to mark up the box ""Return to Sender"" and give it back to USPS, they're not going to just let the box rot somewhere, will they? I'm worried that 1) buyer will find a way to muck this up further 2) or whoever he asks to ""return to sender"" will find a way to muck it up or 3) USPS itself will muck it up or 4) the package will arrive to the new tenant once buyer moves out next week and the new tenant will be shady and open it for themselves or something. 

Either way, I'm sure the buyer will keep hounding me with messages about why I haven't refunded him yet, even though frankly it's literally out of my hands. What do I do? Did I do the right thing? Is there a way to contact Ebay itself if any further problems arise so that I won't be held liable for anything?

Ebay,"Can I set an automatic discount rule for items? I can set it for shipping, but I'd like to set it for the price of the item. Read please...","I sell Lily and Laura bracelets. I sell hundreds each month. I have them priced at 1 for $12+$2 shipping. You can combine shipping. 2 bracelets will equal $2 shipping, and 3 or more bracelets are combined for free shipping. I have a rule that automatically sets the shipping at $2 or free, based on how many bracelets they buy. If the buyer buys 3 or more, we also deduct the price to $10 a bracelets. We have had to just refund the amount. If someone buys 4 bracelets, it charges them $48. I have to refund them $8 so that they get their $10 per bracelet discount.

My question: Can I set a rule or something that will automatically take off a certain amount of money off of the purchase price to prevent having to refund the amount on Paypal.

Ebay,Just Received My First Neutral Feedback,"I started selling on eBay in January so I only have 340 feedback at the moment, however they are all positive. I just received a neutral rating because one of the items I sent was slightly defective and so he sent me a message asking about a refund / sending him a non defective item. I told him I would pay for the return postage as well as send him a non-defective item.

Is there anyway I can ask the buyer to cancel the neutral feedback once I take care of everything or is there really nothing I can do? Also, do you feel as if one neutral feedback would prevent buyers from wanting to buy from me?

Ebay,Chargeback filed via Paypal. Your thoughts?,"I sold a new pair of shoes on 7/19.  The item was Buy-It-Now with immediate payment required via Paypal.  Buyer completed checkout and paid for shoes.  I shipped and they show delivery on 7/24.

Just now (2AM Eastern) I received an email from Paypal saying that the buyer has filed a chargeback for an unauthorized payment.  The boots were delivered three weeks ago and I've heard nothing from the buyer until this.

My plan is to call Paypal before I respond to the dispute.  I have the tracking information.  I also sent the buyer a message via eBay asking about the dispute.  I received absolutely nothing via eBay (no messages, no dispute case, etc) - just the Paypal chargeback.

I'm wondering if it's possible that the buyer is trying to use Paypal to scam me out of the money, since she has the shoes and I didn't get any messages from her asking/inquiring about the transaction.

Thoughts/experience?  I'm sure there have been similar situations before!

Update - I uploaded tracking which auto-populated because I'd used Paypal to ship the item.  I called in and the Paypal rep I spoke with said that she'd release the funds back to me and that for my end of the case, it was closed and the funds were mine to keep.  I'm waiting to see the status of the case change.

Ebay,"Questions about 1099k, eBay Seller Dashboard and 20k limit","First off, I'll apologize for asking these questions if the answers are somewhere obvious. 

About the 1099k and 20k limit, does it take into account things like unpaid cases and refunded items? Is there any accurate, **quick** way for me to calculate my total sales on eBay or through Paypal? For example, is there somewhere where it'll just tell me how much total sales there were over the past X months? 

I'm a fairly new user (5 months) to eBay, so I tried checking my Seller Dashboard to see my total sales and this is where problem comes in: My lifetime sales differed greatly from the number I got when I went through my Paypal records and calculated everything by adding sales one by one. 

When I get close to the 20k limit, will they send me a warning of some sorts, like an email, perhaps or will I just get smacked in the face with a 1099k form? Will Paypal send me the 1099k form based on my eBay sales (I had some unpaid cases) or what was actually recorded on my Paypal records? I think my last and most important question is when does the 20k limit reset? I read that it said calender year, so I'm assuming that the limit resets every January, but any input would be greatly appreciated.

* The user in question has lots of positive feedback, however a lot of it was given today (Aug 13th)

Ebay,Issues with eBay and USPS,"So I have a love-hate relationship with my local USPS office. Specifically, I love to hate them but only because they are far cheaper than the alternatives. Every couple months they begin missing scheduled pickups and it takes a couple phone calls to either the postmaster or customer service to make the problem go away for a while.

This week the problem came back and USPS missed two consecutive scheduled pickups. It is really bad for meeting shipping deadlines when packages sit around for three days, so before closing yesterday I took my stack in to the post office and dropped them off by hand. The packages popped up on tracking an hour later and all was good. With them I left a kindly worded letter for the postmaster that the problem was back and to please look in to it.

This morning I wake up to find that every one of the packages I dropped yesterday has tracking information showing that it is being returned to sender. Most show that they never even left the local office where I dropped them but one shows arrival at the regional sort center before being redirected back.

Anyone had issues like this before? I'm not new to shipping and I can't imagine I messed up postage on five packages. I haven't received them back yet (they all show out for delivery) but I can't help but feel it is retaliatory.

Thoughts?

EDIT: False alarm, turns out it has been really bad status updates and I can only guess that the local office fat-fingered the scanning tool hitting all kinds of wrong buttons. The packages fell off the radar Thursday night stating ""Delivery status not available"" Location N/A but popped up either Delivered or checked in at a sort facility Friday.

I still say the multiple RTS status was alarming to see. Fortunately none of the buyers seem to have noticed; or at least none sent inquiries about it.

Ebay,"If a buyer doesn't respond to a Item Not Described Case, how does it take before Ebay to close it on its own?","I posted last week about a person who bought about $240 of Hagen Renaker animal figures and claimed that several figures were broke. After debating with this buyer for awhile, the person opened an item not as described case against me. The person demanded their money back and I told them the items had to return in order to get a refund.

The buyer said that is too much of a hassle to shipped the items back (claiming that he/she don't want to waste his/her time, gas and whatever) but insist that they still want a huge chunk of their money back. I simply reply that there will be no refund until items are shipped back.

It has been a week since I got the last reply from the buyer and yet to hear anything from eBay. I figure the person isn't going to send the items back. 

So my question is how long will it take before the case is close automatically and will all the money on hold can be access?",8.0,3,2013-08-16,EBAY,0.06320594251155853,0.9043753743171692,0.0324186235666275
Ebay,"Package arrived postage due, found a creative solution.","I bid on an auction for some toys where the seller was contributing a portion of the proceed to charity - in this case, Autism Speaks. My bid ended up winning the lot at a really good price.

The price was so low that the seller ended up paying almost as much in postage as the final sale and probably more after fees and the charitable contribution. I'm pretty sure it was a net loss for the seller.

So... the package arrived a few days later, but with $4.30 postage due. I thought of refusing it, but I didn't want to cost the seller postage again and it was a good price to begin with so I just paid it figuring that if I couldn't work it out with the seller I'd just eat the cost and move on.

The postage due came from a mistake made by the seller. They purchased and printed a Priority Mail label for $8.05, but used a Flat Rate box, which cost $12.30, leaving a difference of $4.30.

I contacted the seller, explained the problem, and included [a photo of the package](http://i.imgur.com/9EYjXBG.jpg) showing the markings the postal service made on the package.

I felt kind of bad asking for the money, knowing that they were trying to do something charitable and ended up with a loss, but I had an idea... I suggested that, rather than refund the $4.30, the seller make a contribution in that amount to their charity, send me a copy of the receipt and we'd call it good. The seller was agreeable and the next day they sent a receipt for a $10 contribution to Autism Speaks. As it turned out, we both have sons with autism and are keen on the issues around it.

So anyway, be careful when using those post office boxes and don't mismatch the box/postage and when something doesn't work out as expected maybe you can find a solution that benefits a third party instead.

Ebay,Help with cell phone cases I'm selling?,"I am selling some Spigen cell phone cases on ebay for about a 4x markup but still $20 under what the official store wants for it.  The store sent me a message saying that they want to remove my listing due to the item possibly being fake or whatever.  I want to keep selling the item (I sold about 3/4 of my stock in 24 hours).  I listed in my auction under the description that there is no way to verify whether or not the item is authentic, so I'm not just saying it is genuine and leaving it at that.  If I change the title, and pics (there are a ton of fake ones listed already), do you think I will be okay?

Here is the message I was sent by Spigen:

We just wanted to contact you as the official eBay store of Spigen SGP to let you know that your listing(s) may be removed by VeRO due to the following reason(s):

1) Use of trademarked name Spigen
2) Use of copyrighted image(s)
3) Item(s) is a counterfeit product which infringes the trademark owner's rights

We ask that you take down your listings if you are not selling genuine Spigen SGP products. It is illegal to sell counterfeit products in the United States.

If you are selling genuine Spigen SGP products, please make the necessary changes.

We will be checking back in 24 hours.

Ebay,"Buyer claims item is damaged, refuses to send me pictures, files claim","I recently sold an item of clothing on eBay. Some woman bought it and paid within a few hours. I shipped it out right away.  

A few days go by and I find out that she had opened a case against me for the item not being as described. I totally do not understand. I contact her and ask her nicely what happened. She said that there was a rip in the item. There was NO rip in it when I shipped it. I checked it when I took pictures. 

I figure it just doesn't fit and she wants a refund and knows I don't take refunds as stated in my auction. She probably ripped the item herself. Also, she REFUSES to send me pictures. She says she doesn't know how to do that. WTF? I told her several times how to send them but she's playing dumb. 

Anyway, PayPal is currently deciding what to do. 

If she sends the item back for a refund, how can I sell it again if she damaged it herself?

BTW, she has excellent feedback on 100s of transactions so I don't expect anyone to believe me, including PayPal.

I called their bluff and offered the full refund plus a pre-paid mailer. Can I print another mailing label from the original item page, but switching the addresses?

Ebay,Ebay newbie needs help and advice. Pretty please?,"I needed a few (5) products from an ebay seller who is overseas. Since the total shipping charges far exceeded the total product cost, i send him a message and asked him if he could reduce the shipping cost by using a single package. I even took a screenshot of my ebay cart and asked him for an approx regarding the total shipping cost.

He replied that he could send them in a single package and asked me to add them into a cart and then contact him to ask about the price. Since i'm new to ebay (0 buys till now), i clicked on request invoice from seller on the top, as i thought this was what he had asked me to do. Following that, i clicked on commit to buy, and send him a message asking him for the discounted shipping cost. 

This was 7 days back. The seller hasnt replied to me yet even after repeated emails.

I needed these products badly, and i found another overseas seller with the same products, and in a moment of stupidity, i added these to cart too, and clicked on request invoice again.

But now both sellers haven't responded to my requests for an invoice, and ebay sends me mails everyday asking me to buy the 10 products (5 each) i've committed to, whose total of individual shipping costs alone make me dizzy.

**Why are both the sellers not responding to me?**

**Was i being stupid by committing to buy, without getting a clear shipping price from the sellers?**

**Is ebay going to ban me soon because of these 10 products i've committed to?**

Ebay,I need to vent...or just need an ebay employee to actually tell me that nothing can be done.,"I've been a seller since 2007, a power seller twice (when I actually focused on it) but it's more of a p/t gig with a store stocked with 200+ vintage collectibles with 100% feedback and never a single neg ever. 

About 2 months ago I had a phone fiasco, burned through my iphone and dealt with 2 replacement insurance phones that apparently never sync'd up with my email nor paypal accounts. I got no messages, I saw no transactions completed, I missed messages coming in, I missed it all. After a week and a half or so I logged in thinking I had some non-paying bidder claims to open (I usually afford a week and a half or so before taking any action) and to my surprise I had a TON of sales and messages with buyers nicely asking ""wtf is going on with my sale?"". I freaked out and realized what happened and called ebay right away. After that I personally called each bidder / buyer and profusely apologized, upgraded everyone's shipping to priority and overnight and got it all out the door pronto.  

Because of that week and a half / two week stint I was dinged on stars for the first time ever. I dropped to below the minimum ""standard"" to ""below standard"" and rightfully so. I should have actually logged into a computer rather than assume people were being assholes and not paying me. It was my fault. 

Here's my situation now. Because of that one screw up (the first in SEVEN years of impeccable selling) I'm now ""below standard"". Every sale is held in PayPal from the time it comes in until 3 days after it's been delivered. I can't sell anything else, I can't even list additional items. I have a ton of fall items and can't list anything else in my store. I've talked to ebay, I've talked to PayPal. Both tell me it's out of their hands though one rep at PayPal told me to press for a manager at eBay and that they could ""change some things manually"" but the manager at ebay told me PayPal lied and there was nothing they could do. 

Now it's the 20th, my account had been re-reviewed as they all are on the 20th and because of those transactions from less than 3 weeks ago, I'm again below standard. This was my screw up and I accept that. It was an honest mistake but how many months will my funds be held? How much longer until I can list anything? No one and I mean, countless phone calls to ebay has provided zero help or answers. I am ridiculously pissed off at this point. Not because it's anyone else's fault, I'm the one that should have checked in to be sure all was on the up and up, but the fall out on this is absurd. I still have 100% feedback, I have over 7 years of positive selling history here and no one at ebay nor PP seems to care to help me with this. 

I doubt anyone will bother reading that diatribe but it's cathartic if nothing else to just bitch and vent. If there's any ebay or pp reps reading this I'd be super grateful for any insight you can lend me.",9.0,12,2013-08-21,EBAY,0.07472014427185059,0.8974912762641907,0.027788516134023666
Ebay,Should I be worried?,"Long story short, I bought a laptop, didn't receive it, dealt with the retailer directly, retailer made an insurance claim to the shipping company as I bought insurance for it. I initiated a dispute pre-emptively given the amount, seller had it escalated to a claim, I called up Paypal, tracking wasn't working, they sided with me. I contacted the retailer to know why they'd done it to begin with, they said their claims department was taking care of it all and that I shouldn't worry.

We're a month after the fact and they appealed the case today and Paypal sided with them because the tracking information was functional. I haven't received any news regarding the shipping claim. No funds were sent back, but Paypal gives me 3 days or else they ""may"" (yes, that's the term they used in the email) force it out of my account.

I had pretty much given up on the hopes of getting the machine, had Best Buy pricematch it and bought it locally instead. 

I live in a high foot traffic area and the delivery people always point to who the package's for before they ask for a signature. I've suspected neighbors but no one's said anything and it hasn't happened again afterwards. This in spite of packages being left at my door sometimes, too. I thought it happened again for another high value item but it turned out that my mom took delivery of it and she had left with it. Her name had completely been butchered by the delivery guy, too.

Ebay,I'm in a bit of trouble! Here is a unique Ebay conundrum! Advice?,"Okay, so, I used to run manage my bosses ebay account as a part of my job. everything was in his name with his information.  It was low volume but he had accumulated 5,000 stars and it was a fairly old account.  

Well, he DIDNT give me access to the paypal for months, so i couldnt refund people, and when he finally did there was a huge pressure to ship things and not accept returns (i mean, in reality it works, its like buying form a junkyard.  its not a store.  but on ebay, we have to comply with the regulations of everyone else.)  to make a (very) long story (filled with ups, downs, suspensions, and more) short, A lot of people got upset , and though I kept it going for almost a year, the store ultimately got banned, finishing with 91% positive and nearly 14% bad description DSR, plus some very high percentages in other categories.  I got an email saying the account was to be permanently suspensed from selling (we're still allowed to log in, and buy, just not sell)

So in the meantime i made a deal with him to source at the warehouse for free and sell under my own personal account -- properly -- which is what i am currently doing now (and i have had very good feedback, with the exception of a few bad sales last month which have been resolved and the account is in good standing.)

But now, 6 months later, he is asking if the suspension is lifted yet.  It's not, as he feedback is still on file, but i did notice the DSR percentages have dropped because the earliest bad feedbacks have fallen off the 12 month record backlog.

So, theoretically, inevitably his feedback and DSr will return to 0 once all of the negative feedback falls off.  What I am wondering is, when and if this happens, will the ebay system automatically give him another evaluation, and because the negatives will be fallen off, count it as an improvement and lift the selling limits up from 0, or if calling ebay to complain once that point is reached will lead to a reinstatement of the selling ability.

I wonder if any of you have even gone that far under the radar for so long, but if anyone has any information on this strategy it will be appreciated.

Ebay,Long time buyer/first time seller seeking advice.,"Over the past 7 years I have bought 28 items from eBay with 100% positive feedback. Now I want to sell something but I am a bit anxious as I am inexperienced. 

I cracked the screen on my 32gig iPad Mini WiFi and Apple wants $219 to replace it out of warranty. A friend recommended I just sell it on eBay and buy a new one, seeing as that model costs $429 new. I've seen the 16gig version go for for over $200, so I figure it might be worth my while seeing as I'd hope to get more for the higher-up model.

Problem is, I only have a feedback ""score"" of 28 and I live in Vancouver, Canada. Shipping would be more costly and I don't know how legit 28 feedback points looks. Also, I'd like to set a reserve of ~$200 but I am afraid I'll scare bidders off.

I checked my ebay, paypal and bank accounts and there is no charge for this item. In fact, I noticed back in 2012 that the original payment for the kit I ordered had been canceled. This is from a large ebay seller and I'd like to do the right thing and inform them of this, but I wanted to check that this wasn't a possible scam scenario.

Once it seemed like I was able to activate as I was actually able to buy it, but now every time I want to pay the seller it brings me back to an activation screen. I've tried 3 different browser, nothing.

Ebay,First Time Seller: Help with expensive WoW item,"Hi guys. A couple years back I won a WoW Gift Card looking thing that gives an access code to a virtual mini pet. I never used it and kind of forgot about it but noticed I could sell the card with an unscratched code on ebay for around 600-700 dollars. Similar auctions can be seen here:

I have never sold anything on ebay before but could really use the money for grad school. My grandpa used to sell antiques on ebay so I think he has an account with some positive feedback and I was thinking I would try and use that. Here are the questions I have

1) The one thing that really worries me is selling to a scammer and getting a chargeback on paypal. Is there anything I can do to protect myself from this occurring? 

2) Should I start the bidding really low with the goal of getting more attention (say $50 dollars no minimum bid?) or start it high to try and avoid underselling?

Ebay,Is it worth it parting out netbooks?,"I noticed that netbooks are faily cheap lately. eee PCs and Aspire Ones sell for $70-$100 shipped. Then when something is broken and you have to replace parts the LCD costs $50, the keyboard ~~$50 (how?)~~ $10, the front cover ~~$60~~$10, and then you still have the hard drive and the motherboard.

Is it viable to buy all the netbooks and part them out and sell the parts?

EDIT: I'm an idiot. I was wondering why a replacement keyboard costs $50, turns out I still had ""min price"" on $50 and didn't notice when I was looking for keyboards.


To make this thread not usless, I will calculate a full netbook for a test:

Acer Aspire One ZG5 - $100

LCD - $40
Top Cover (touchpad area) - $20

Ebay,Counterfeit designer eyeglasses. What should I do?,"I bought a pair of eyeglasses without prescription on eBay. I live in the U.S. and the seller is from Canada.

I tell her to hold off on fitting the glasses as I wanted to get a refund. Luckily, I was still able to open a case with eBay and the seller responds with some BS. He used a distributor to drop ship my item, he had no idea and will not use that distributor again, etc, etc. I demanded a full refund (item price + shipping fees) and a return shipping fee as the seller wanted the item back for inspection. The counterfeiter agrees on eBay case response, but that was a week ago. He keeps responding with, I need to get back to the office, I'm in contact with my partner in U.S. to address the situation, etc. What should I do at this point?

Ebay,Shipping via Pitney Bowes - International Priority Shipping / Global Shipping,"I've posted a while ago that Pitney Bowes seems to be doing some strange things and that I was concerned with what they're doing.

It's time to provide some bits of information concerning my experience.

1 The item arrived and everything was fine. It was working just fine.

2 It arrived on time.

If you're a seller, you should know that I'll be looking to see if you're offering this shipping option. UPS and all the others are quicker, but they are much more expensive. 

That means I'd have to pay 300-600 USD for some items to be shipped via UPS and a lot less to have them shipped via PBI. For some items, I have to pay 1400 or 1800 USD to have them shipped to me via UPS. It costs just 300 USD to have those shipped to me via PBI.

Given that some of these items cost only 400-600 USD, it really doesn't make sense to pay 1400 or 1800 USD for shipping via UPS.

Ebay,"Bought item for $50.00 and used PayPal, received a decoy item worth maybe $1.00 (nothing like what I purchased). Opened dispute with PayPal. What are the odds I will get my money back from them? (More details in text).","So, I purchased a watch from a Chinese vendor around the end of July. About 10 days ago I get an email from eBay stating that the seller has closed his eBay account and not to pay or contact PayPal if i did. I waited a few days until the the 25th of August and opened up a did not receive dispute with PayPal.

Today, I received a small package from the seller that did not have a watch in it. There was two glass elephants (one broken) in a small bubble package. I signed back in to PayPal and changed my dispute from not received to item not as described. 

What are the odds that I am on the hook for the $50.00 versus PayPal returning my money? I am in Canada if that matters...

Ebay,"First time seller, buyer claims item doesn't work. How screwed am I?","Hello, dear reddit ebayers. After buying a plethora of stuff on ebay, I wanted to try my hand at selling something. Everything went fine up until the buyer received the item, claiming it doesn't work. He now wishes to get his money back. I accepted payment through PayPal.

I personally tested it out right before I shipped it, and it still worked. The item is a Gameshark SP, which I carefully wrapped in bubble wrap, before putting it in an envelope lined with bubble wrap. I think that technically, the only reason it wouldn't work anymore would be because the item would be physically broken, which he didn't mention. 

I sent him instructions on how to properly use the item, thinking he might just not have used it correctly, though so far I haven't received a reply yet.

My question is; do I have to reimburse him, like he wishes? What if he'd ship the item back to me, and it'd turn out it still works? I'm just scared he'll open up a dispute with ebay which I might end up losing.

It seems like the only buyers I'm getting are across the country from me.  Something that would cost $6.50 to mail to the states around mine is $12 to send to the other coast.  

I offer free shipping on everything, so it makes a big difference.  I recently sold a $24.99 item; eBay took $2.50 and Paypal took $1.02.  The postage was $10.37 for parcel select, which was the cheapest option.  I ended up with about $11 to take home on the sale.  The package was 3lbs.
