Ebay,"Dispute filed by buyer, what to expect?","Hey there,

New to selling on eBay, and just had the following happen.

Buyer used buy it now to buy an item.  Item was shipped with tracking/insurance.  

Buyer sent message on the 28th asking for positive feedback(item was shipped on the 26 after the holiday).

Buyer sent message yesterday asking if I accept returns(no reason given).  Within 2 hours, buyer opened a claim saying ""item not as described"" and that I have not responded to his messages(he gave me under 2 hours).

Regarding item description.  They are collectible cards(magic cards).  He's not claiming the condition or anything is off(they were well packaged in sturdy holders, 4 of them, in a bubble mailer), but rather saying I gave him 4 completely different cards than he bought.

Essentially he's flat out lying.

I responded to him through ebay(all messages so far have been) informing him I do not accept returns(as stated in the auction).

What can I expect if he escalates this(which I'm assuming he will)?

Edit:  He just left negative feedback and escalated to customer support.  Time to wait and see I guess.


Edit 2:  Surprise surprise, eBay sided with the buyer.  Now I guess I'll have to wait and see if he sends back what I actually shipped him, or the junk he claims he received.

Edit 3:  This is posted below, but I'll leave it here too.

Sorry! I got cards back from the buyer. They were not the ones I shipped him, and the kicker, they were not the ones he claimed to have received. They were different cards!

Once I received them, I called eBay to ask what to do from here. After I convinced the first lady that yes, I had the package(it showed as in transit on eBay, but she checked UPS.com and it showed delivered Wednesday), she sent me on to someone else. The second lady reviewed the case, I told her my side(she actually seemed to get the difference in the cards) and she said she'd close it, then appeal it once it was closed.

Shortly after the buyer was refunded his money, and then within a few hours I was refunded my money. Ebay wound up being out the purchase price, which I guess keeps buyer/seller happy, but they essentially got scammed by the buyer for the price.

Question now is, how do I contest his negative feedback, can I report him, and how should I leave his feedback?",25,6,2012-06-01,EBAY,0.05967593565583229,0.9113147854804993,0.029009290039539337

Ebay,"After eBay made bidder names anonymous, i wanted a happy space where people could talk about eBay listings, and, three years later, finally got it done. (link inside in text)","**link to site: [www. bubakiki.com](http://www.bubakiki.com/)**

AMA and/or please tell me what you think!! Thanks!!!

I went on eBay as a newbie collector of Native American collectibles about seven years back. I got TONS of help from other **bidders**. I'm sure I would have lost my shirt on more than one occasion had other bidders not helped me out repeatedly. The big revelation was that I got what was often very in-depth advice and information from competing bidders who I contacted through the bidder list of the items i was bidding on.

I was continuously surprised by the fact that these people went out of their way to help me --and, not to be corny, but there was something uplifting about it. The bidders with the most information to share, i imagined, probably had a good idea of what they were willing to pay for an item anyway, and, it also feels good to talk about stuff you're passionate about.... I don't know.

Anyway, due to privacy concerns, eBay switched to anonymous bidder names (you can no longer see and contact bidders on a listing unless you are the seller), and I really just miss the excitement of talking to other bidders while a listing is live.

As for the site: 
&gt;it's early beta and there's a lot to be improved, fixed, and upgraded. If you check it out, you'll see the *Recent Discussions*; those will have paging (prev...1,2,3...next) so you can browse old comments as far back as you want to go. 
&gt;Lots of new updates in the pipeline (bigger pictures on item pages, for example).
&gt;cool feature not available on eBay is you can do a search and get results by 'most bids,' which you can't do on eBay.
&gt;we're also going to be doing some promotions soon where we give eBay cash cards to members as reward for garnering expert points.

PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK!

**EDIT**: Btw, I'm an after effects guy and I made the video on the home page myself. I'm pretty proud of it. I do mostly titles and stuff for spots and had never done any kind of character animation, thus the crazy leg movements of the bird.

**EDIT**: Also, I'm hoping that sellers will start a discussion on their own items and give people additional information (and/or just address potential bidders) as a way to get exposure on our home page.

**EDIT**: Feature: Listings don't disappear on bubakiki, so if you have any grievance or praise for a buyer or seller, you can leave that on the item and there will be a permanent record of it.

**tl;dr** - after bidder lists were anonymized on eBay, I missed having contact with the collectibles bidder community that I had been used to talking to -and i was sure others had the same experience in other areas of eBay- so I made the biggest mistake of my life and set about, as a person with no programming experience, getting partners and investors coders to create a **[site](http://www.bubakiki.com/)** that would make me happy again.",9,9,2012-06-02,EBAY,0.049536656588315964,0.9268966317176819,0.0235667172819376

Ebay,Has anyone had experience paying European (or international) sellers without Paypal?,"I'm in the United States and might buy an Austrian item that is worth less than $50 incl shipping.

1) Bank to bank wire transfers:   fees are way too expensive.

3) Mail actual currency:   I trust the seller but I don't think its 'legal' to just mail currency into Austria, according to google results  Of course I could try and hide it.

4) Xe.com :   It can apparently send money a couple ways.  This avoids an outbound transfer fee and exorbitant currency conversion fees, but could still trigger fees at the receiving bank in Austria.

Its pretty weird because the seller is all about bikers stuff and suddenly he starts selling iphones?

I know about the hijacked accounts scam.(if you dont just google it ;) )
But hes accepting paypal.

I can get cheap mobile phones such as iphones, samsung galaxy etc, since I work with that kind of stuff, but this price seems too good for a 64gb unlocked.

What do you guys think?

EDIT: I've reported the listing.

I've sent and email and contacted the member directly. Still no reply.
If this is a scam and he's accepting paypal probably the paypal account was also hijacked.

And A LOT of people will lose their money on this. There are about 30 phones already sold ATM which will be about £12k!

Ebay,12 years on eBay and first major issue.  I guess it was about time.,"**TL;DR:  Sold a non-working, as-is laptop;  buyer isn't happy.  I offered a complete refund including eating shipping both ways, but he still isn't happy.  I think he's going to open a dispute against me.**


Hey folks, just wanted to hear some of your thoughts.  First of all, I've been with eBay since August 2000 and have been selling off and on for the last 9 of those years.   I've got nearly 1,000 feedbacks with a 100% positive rating.  yay, me.  

So I started work for a small private college in the IT department, and at the beginning of each summer we clear out  our storage closet and throw a bunch of stuff on eBay.  Old printers, lots of 20 hard drives, broken laptops, that sort of thing.  

We listed a 2007 macbook that had been brought to us during the school year.  It had liquid spilled on it and we diagnosed the motherboard as being toast.   

We threw it on eBay with a good-faith description of the item, including what happened to it, the condition ""for parts or not working"" ...put phrases like ""AS IS, NO RETURNS"" ""DOES NOT WORK"" ""NO RETURNS OR REFUNDS"" 

The buyer paid $166 for it, which shocked me.  I looked at his feedback, and see he sells a lot of used macbooks on eBay.  Okay, so he thinks he can fix it and re-sell it, good for him.  

Then he emails me requesting positive feedback, and seemed to get upset when I told him I waited until i thought the transaction was finished before leaving feedback.  At that point i was starting to get that sinking feeling.  Sure enough, a couple days later, I get an ""Item not as described"" communication from him saying what terrible shape the laptop is in and how I didn't disclose a bunch of stuff (most of which I feel he is probably making up) and he is unhappy with the item. 

Since I use my personal account for this, I decided to protect my feedback and offered him a complete, no-questions-asked return.  I told him it would include the original shipping he had paid.  I even printed a return label through eBay and saved it to a PDF and emailed him, so he wasn't out shipping back to us.   He responded ""OK"" (literally a two letter reply).  That was thursday.  This weekend I checked the tracking to see if it was in the mail yet and it hadn't entered the system. 

Then tonight, i get a message back saying he's actually not okay with that after all (but didn't state WHAT he wanted).  I got a bit miffed but responded back basically telling him he could either ship it back at my expense for a refund, or keep the laptop.  

Question:  I've heard buyer protection usually sides with the buyer, but with a buyer as uncooperative as this, do I have a decent chance of coming out on top if this comes to a formal dispute (which I'm sure is where it's headed).  I've used eBay's message system for everything except the shipping label (which I did at least document by saying I sent the label to XXX address from XXX address), so that should all be viewable by them.  

Heck, here's our conversation log via pastebin if you're so inclined.  
http://pastebin.com/pVpJ3W57

What do you think, reddit, do I stand a chance?  I feel like I've already bent over backwards, and like I said, I had that sense that he was going to be trouble the minute he started pestering me to leave him positive feedback ASAP.   I don't believe he's telling the truth in some of his description about the laptop, but I did not disassemble the laptop for a close internal inspection so I have no way of knowing for sure.  

Any advice or tips?  Thanks!

**UPDATE**

Looks like he's probably just going to hit me with a negative and move on.  I think he even knows he doesn't have a leg to stand on as far as a buyer claim.

I've checked the auction (logged in and not) and I am able to at least use the shipping calculator without issue and the proper price shows up for my test addresses. 

I am shipping out of Canada and ship Worldwide. I have removed the ""Require immediate payment"" requirement temporarily to see if that helps. At least that way I should be able to send an invoice to the customer with the shipping so they can pay that way. 

Obviously, I don't want to invoice directly through Paypal as that is not the right way to do it. Below are some pictures of my shipping settings.

Ebay,What to do next?,"So, I bought a deal that was too good to be true- http://www.ebay.com/itm/170848555307?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649

I really should have looked closer at the picture, but I was excited to find a sale with all five games at less than $10/game. Of course, any of you who know these games may notice that Pokemon Ruby and Fire Red are not supposed to have the exact same color shell, and all of them are supposed to have shiny stickers on the front. So, as soon as I opened the items, I could tell they were fakes. Then, when I actually tried to play some of the games, I found that Ruby didn't save correctly, and Sapphire had glitches when starting a new game.

Therefore, I contacted the seller, telling them that the games were all counterfeit and a few were glitching, and that I wanted a refund. The seller claimed the items were legit, and that any glitches must be due to my GBA hardware being fake. (Obviously untrue- the problems happened on all three of my systems that could play the games!) So, figuring they'd deny it up and down, I opened a claim with ebay. Less than an hour later, the seller refunds the cost, ebay closes the claim, and I get a message from the seller asking me to ""please return the items to me?""

So, my question is this- Since ebay never told me to, do I have to send the items back? *Should* I send the items back? The seller would obviously just re-list them to rip off some other poor schmuck, and I really don't want to pay for shipping back to China. (Yeah, that should have been my other clue.)",19,3,2012-06-08,EBAY,0.044221434742212296,0.919456422328949,0.03632219135761261

Ebay,I had a great eBay return experience (as a seller).,"This is because I feel there are very few positive stories about buyer disputes as a seller. I'd just like to share my story. eBay has been awesome to me in this process. Long story but awesome buyer emails!

I sold a vintage sewing machine to a zero feedback buyer who signed up the day they bid on my item. Rookie mistake, I will not allow 0 feedbackers to buy from me again. 

They got the item, claimed it was broken although I packed it very securely. I asked for pictures of the item before refunding, and they claimed that it was a mother's day present for their 75 yr old mom (even though the listing ended 2 days after Mother's Day...) and that I had broken her heart and her mother doesn't have a camera etc. I've received about 10 harassing messages from this eBayer like this one:



Dear seller,

You can expect it all you want and you will see that this is how you should have sent it to my Mother and I do EXPECT THAT REFUND A.S.A.P , my mother is so hurt that you would even have sent that machine the way you did . so please do not send another email like this was her fault because as you will see it not , we have all the proof we need to take this all the way and I WILL , ELAINE , I'am SO surprised that you would even think that a 75 year old women would even think of doing anything wrong when she is the innocent party in this matter ........

Dear buyer,

Hello,

We received a package slip in the mail today. We will pick up the package tomorrow and inspect it. Thank you.





This is the way the buyer has been interacting with me with nothing but professionalism on my end. 

I get the item back. The bottom was a solid wooden base and when I got it back it was in pieces. It looks like someone beat it with a hammer. I am appalled that someone would do this and I call eBay and open a buyer dispute case on myself, telling them that there is something strange here. The buyer has been harassing me etc. 

The awesome rep refunds the buyer, appeals it and allows me to keep my $. They clear the negative association of opening a case from my account. They report the buyer as abusive, while laughing at their atrocious grammar. That's it, the end, I'm happy to have such great service. 

Turns out buyer's not happy with just a refund. They want return shipping refunded too. Would normally do that, but not when being treated like this:



'Hello , Ok now that the refunded of the price of the machine and shipping to my Mother was refunded I DO expected the refund of the RETURN SHIPPING DUE TOP THE FACT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY MOM , AS YOU CAN SEE IT COST MY MOTHER 46.97 TO RETURN A BROKEN MACHINE THAT WAS NOT PACKED CORRECTLY , ONCE I GET A EMAIL THAT YOU ARE REFUNDING MY MOM'S SHIPPING AND HANDLING AND I SHOULD ASK FOR THE CAMERA ALSO WHICH COST 7.99 $ TO PROVE THAT THIS IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY , SO DO THE RIGHT THING HERE AND GIVE HER BACK HER REFUND ON SHIPPING BACK TO YOU , SHE LIVES ON 550.00 SS A MONTH. ITS TO BAD THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE THAT WAS THE MACHINE SHE REALLY WANTED , THANK YOU ELAINE HER DAUGHTER '




It's amazing to read, sorry for caps. Apparently they even bought a 'camara' that I need to refund. Needless to say I ignore, on advice from eBay rep. They contact customer service on me and i get an email  I call eBay. They tell me that I don't need to do anything and they've reprimanded the buyer for this behavior and that anymore messages will get them banned!

They haven't contacted me since.  

eBay  said that since I kept a cool head, did not blame eBay, did all the legwork on my own without waiting for the buyer, and have been getting harassed, they were more willing to work with me to make sure I'm a happy seller. 

And I am. And I have blocked this buyer        . Good job eBay! Sorry for length.",10,9,2012-06-14,EBAY,0.11854259669780731,0.8530308604240417,0.028426511213183403

Basically I'm wondering if there is a way, when designing your ebay layout, to do an ""include"" in some way. I want to make it so that in the future if I want to do a special offer I can just edit one text file and then all the different listings can source that text file for the HTML code so I can update all the listings at once instead of doing it manually.

I'm sure some of these listing programs do this by automatically changing all the pages but is there a way to do it generally like you would with a normal website? The only thing I can do at the moment is have an image on every page that I can change and therefore c hange every listing but this isn't ideal as I can't do links that change or text that changes.

Hope this question makes sense.

I shipped an AMD processor (FX-8150) to him just over a week after the end of the auction since he messaged me to tell me he didn't have the money yet (and ""oh yeah do you think you could possibly ship it before I pay?""  no joke, he tried to do this).

I ship the thing to him after he pays me over a week later and now he claims the CPU is not in the package.

He opens a case asking for a full refund.

Ebay,"First time seller here, wondering why people aren't bidding on my item?","So I am fairly new to eBay - and brand new to selling - and I posted my first auction up two days ago.  It is a used PlayStation 2 with a lot of accessories/games, and I started the price much below what it is worth.  I've seen similar lots (and it seems to be a desirable item) go for 60$ to 70$ to even 100$+, however nobody seems to be bidding on mine.  I only have one watcher (had 2 at one point) and a handful of views so far.

I am okay with selling the item at a lower than average price (it was a hardly used gift a long time ago), but selling it at all would be a start.  Are people not bidding because I am a new seller (everyone has to start somewhere, no?)?  Did I do something wrong in writing the description?  Is it common to offer free shipping to attract buyers, even when it costs an arm and a leg to ship things?  Is the starting price too high (I've seen some expensive things start at .99 cents, the idea of taking that risk blows my mind)?

The way it works is the person checks out on ebay, pays and then ships their device to me. I do the service and ship it back to them. Done deal.

I have this one guy who, after being informed about where he needs to ship his unit to, never did. It's been almost 3 weeks or so and now, without even contacting me, he put in a paypal charge back and stated ""item not received""

I have no problem refunding the guy his money since I never actually  did the service. He is also not responding to my emails about his chargeback.

* If I agree to the chargeback, can he still leave neg feedback for me? 

* Should I just initiate cancel transaction?

* Do I have to refund before I initiate cancel transaction? Or is that done after? Or automatically?

Just trying to figure out a way to lessen the chance to receive neg feedback. The listing clearly states the batteries can not be sold to the general public and it must be done in my tech shop. Perhaps he did not read that part and thought I would just send him a battery? Which would be illegal btw.  I don't know, he's not responding to me.

Ebay,First time seller here: how do I avoid getting ripped off with a local pickup (I'm selling a large cabinet saw)?,"Hi Reddit,

After reading through this subreddit a bit, I'm a little concerned about what I don't know about selling on ebay. Some background info:

I wish I'd thought to check for this subreddit before posting my listing but better late than never (I hope). I've had my Ebay account for over 8 years but have probably only purchased 6 to 12 items in all that time so I don't have a high rating of any kind (but no negatives either).

A life change is forcing me to sell my small woodworking shop and so I've started listing my tools that I need to sell. The first (and only) one I've listed thus far is for my large cabinet/table saw. Since the item is so large and heavy, I made the listing for local pickup only and have Paypal as my only payment option.

I'm getting (what I feel like) is some great movement on the auction already (I made it a 10 day listing and less than 2 days in, my auction is getting very close to my reserve price) however what has me worried is that in Ebay's fine print, it says local pickup auctions can take up to 21 days to receive payment from Paypal.

What can I do to protect myself from someone winning the auction, picking up the saw and then opening a claim with Paypal saying they never got it (or it wasn't as described, etc.)? And how concerned should I be (this saw will probably sell for between $1,000 and $2,000 which is a lot of money to me right now)?

Ebay,Need help with closed ebay case,"I sold a used roomba on ebay at the begining of last month for a little over $100.  I sent the item out, it came back as an invalid address while I was on vacation and wasn't able to re-ship it for two weeks after it had been returned to me.

So I ship it out and next day received an email from ebay saying the user had filed a complaint and escallated it to ebay for them to resolve it and they closed it in his favor with a full refund.  I put the blame on myself for not responding to the ticket because I had assumed that the buyer would close it once he received the item (I sent it via priority).

Anyway, is there anything I can do at this point to either A) get my money back or B) have the item resent to me?  I have a tracking number that states it was delivered several days ago and the buyer hasnt responded to my emails.

Ebay,Ebay/Paypal incompetence rips off another buyer/seller.,"Twelve years ago I signed up for Ebay.  During that time, I moved but updated my address information.  I've been using Ebay regularly without issue.

  I made a purchase this week.   Ebay/Paypal showes the address that will be used during the payment phase.  It was correct for this purchase.  For some reason known only to Ebay they sent the address on an old Paypal account that I haven't used in 12 years.    

  Ebay did not use the address on my Ebay Account.  Ebay/Paypal did not use the address on my wife's paypal account which I used to pay item.  They did not use the address presented at checkout.

  Damn them for a screwup that cost me money with nothing to show for it!   Further damn them for the support call where the only thing they would do is claim to remove the old paypal account link.   I had to log on and do that just now.
