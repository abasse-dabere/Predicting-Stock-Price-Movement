Ebay,"Sold used personal items on ebay, Paypal accidentally reported it, what should i do now?","A bit desperate here as paypal customer service has been no help.



The gist of my problem is paypal reported a 1099-k (31 transactions for $4,424) to the IRS for 2015. They reported this because they accidentally tagged income from my 501c3 business account to my personal SSN. I got the 501c3 1099k fixed however the IRS is still now saying i owe taxes/self employment on my personal 1099k (that never should have been sent but was because of the mistake on my 501c3). I called the IRS and explained that the money from 2015 was from selling used items on ebay when we moved homes but they said I still need to report it. I also called PayPal looking for guidance and they said they would ""zero out my 1099k for 2015"" and send it to me via mail... well sure enough a week has passed and they sent me the wrong 1099k and im going in circles trying to get the new form.

 

So my questions are:

 

1. Do I owe taxes on the sale of my used personal goods in 2015/How do i report and file it? (the IRS is currently considering it capital gains and self employment). I thought all i need to do was write a letter to the IRS stating that these were garage sale items.

 

2. Will a zeroed out 1099k form from paypal even help? Since they already reported that money to the IRS, do i have to file/explain? or do i wait for the zeroed out form and just tell the IRS ""it was a mistake, heres the new 1099k showing zero.""



There is a serious disconnect with paypal customer service. Their system of ""you cant speak to the person who can help you, but ill put in a ticket and have a nice day"" creates a serious gap in getting the proper help provided.",4,2,2018-06-01,EBAY,0.08287399262189865,0.8908787369728088,0.026247233152389526
Ebay,Scam for Nintendo Switches?,"Hey all, so I was looking for a nintendo switch on ebay when a came across an account that was selling for a stupid low amount ($43) saying it was brand new etc. I bought it thinking what harm could come with how ebay is with buyers now and thinking it was a mistake listing.

Ebay,Buyer bought an item from me. Wants to return because they found a better price?,"A buyer purchased an item from me that was listed as No Returns.

What is the best course of action here?  I'd like to do what is right but I also don't want to deal with a bunch of headache. (e.g. having funds frozen by PayPal for weeks)  As a seller I know full well how eBay is biased toward the concerns of buyers, but is there an exception in this case?

What if they leave a red mark on my feedback page?",6,5,2018-06-02,EBAY,0.050149835646152496,0.9258425831794739,0.024007583037018776
Ebay,"Buyer found to exploit eBay's and PayPal's incompetence, post USPS tracking period.","I had second thoughts about posting this exploit/loophole due to mass misuse but I am forced to do so because nowadays it seems that this is what it usually takes to resolve most of such issues to get attention of people who make main decisions past the bureaucracy that prevents it from being fixed quickly, as I have recently been forced to waste my personal time to speak to a PayPal rep who gave me the money from their own funds the buyer stole right under my nose and to this day still keeps it, another reason is to give you a warning of such potential fraud so you as a seller can be prepared. From what I've been told over the phone, the main reason the PayPal rep decided I deserved it was because of my perfect track record \(thanks but.. aren't you going to implement anything to prevent it from happening again?\). It seems eBay and PayPal's bureaucracy will further delay the implementation of a very simple feature that can extend the records the USPS no longer provides publicly on their website as evidence the item was delivered.

So here's what happened.. In December of 2017, I had an item sold. Now, I'm the type of person that is paranoid about item getting safely to buyers hands and I am 100&amp;#37; sure it was as I often check tracking info to confirm all items get delivered and by now they all have. Just few weeks ago, the buyer \(knowing full well the tracking info is no longer available on USPS site eBay and PayPal\) decided to file a claim with PayPal, that the item was never received. But PayPal offered me to submit counter claim and evidence to which I no longer had access to. For one, eBay does not show records post 60 days. USPS site shows a generic page where it just says the tracking label was created but no records were found as it does for every other item delivered after many months. I never received the item was delivered email by eBay as only Buyers do. So I was out of luck.

Here's my outlook on this whole dumb ordeal. Is it so hard for both eBay and PayPal to keep such simple ""Delivered"" = ""1"" record in their own database at least extending to the 120 Days the buyer is allowed to file such false claim? Seriously? At least a screenshot will do. But I asked PayPal if my own screenshot would be considered as a valid evidence, surprisingly they claimed it would, possibly oblivious to how easily spoofed it can be by Photo\-shopping it.

And there you have it, another post added to show how eBay and PayPal favor buyers word without consideration for even their own funds and resources.

I'd like to also make a separate post about how eBay lets buyers freely ruin your perfect feedback without letting you first resolve a case, not even giving you an opportunity to refund. Buyer simply left negative feedback without contacting you first. This is beyond ridiculous to even mention the fact that sellers aren't even allowed to post negative feedback to buyer by warning other sellers \(non equal opportunity marketplace here\). I just pulled all my listings from eBay. I'm done. Most of my unsold items including shipping materials I was holding on to re\-purpose will now go to a landfill and further pollute our land, oceans and air.

Ebay,Protection as a Canadian seller selling to the US.,"I sold my first very high priced item ($1000) to the States.  I had it listed for about four months locally and didn't get any serious replies and it has been on eBay for about a couple of months.

I googled his name and there's a lot of information on those background check sites, but you have to register to get access and that's something I'm not going to do.  The funds are in the Paypal account and I plan on shipping it within the next couple of days.  It's a niche video game too - not sure if video games are hot items for scammers.

Is there anything I can do as a seller to protect against the buyer creating an INAD scam or do I just have to take a risk.  I'm not even sure in the insurance is going to cover the item once it crosses the border.

Ebay,The buyer can lose,"**Update**: I got in contact with an ebay rep. Apparently it was closed as the tracker hadn't updated for two weeks, so they marked it as the package not received. Would've being nice if they'd told me that rather than closing it without comment. Anyway I showed them an email from the Postage service saying that it's still in customs and they are refunding me and handling it manually.

**Update 2** They are now telling me I need to contact the seller and ask them to investigate why the package is still in customs. Let's see if they respond.

---

Most of the tales here are about the sellers losing cases. Today I am going to tell you that buyers can lose them as well. 

So I purchased an LCD panel a while back and unfortunately the device seemed to have an issue with the lcd's ribbon cable as the image was inverted and showing signal issues. As a buyer I opened a request for return and the seller promptly accepted the return.

So it seems all good so far, but here is where things get off track.

eBay sent me an email about a return shipping label, saying that it would come from the seller, but nothing appeared and when I contacted the seller they told me that there was none, and provided no actual resolution. They just said 'no', which was odd as they had already accepted the return. So I opened a dispute asking ebay to step in. They gave me a big long email of instructions on how to send it via international post and assured me that when it reaches the seller I would be refunded.

So I sent it.

I send all of the details to the ebay rep and got a response that said:

&gt;We appreciate your efforts in providing us the photo requested and it's good to know that you already returned the item. I have looked into the tracking details, I confirmed that it has already been accepted by &lt;Postage service name removed&gt;

The package soon reaches the seller's country and stops in customs for two weeks. Last I checked it's still sitting there :/

And then ebay closes the case without refund due to:

&gt; 'You returned the item without authorisation from the seller or eBay and did not provide tracking'

I tried to appeal and the result was:

&gt;After reviewing this case, we decided to keep the original outcome. We weren't able to grant your appeal because we determined the original decision was correct.

So let this be a lesson that the buyer can also lose out.

Now I'm off the see if I can at least get my return postage back from paypal.

Edit:
~~I think I know what happened. The seller has a limitation on refunds that are ""30 days after the buyer receives it"" and I received it a month ago, or I tripped a fraud check as my paypal and ebay accounts have different email addresses. This is going to be fun to sort out.~~

Item comes back, I can confirm what he's seeing but I can't verify it was there when it was shipped, although in my head I'm confident it wasn't like this and I'm wondering if he stole parts from my item. I refund him to avoid an eBay case that I will lose

I then go about repairing the minor damage and I realise that not only is there more damage than expected, this damage is 100% new, and there is a scuff mark which could not have been caused while the item was packaged - he's dropped it and lied!

Ebay,I'm being scammed by 2 Russian buyers and I desperately need help / advice...,"Short version of the story (there's obviously loads more detail available but I'm trying to just go with the basics here so this doesn't turn into a novel) -

I sold 2 video games on eBay, value £45 to a Russian on a Saturday. Did my usual 'protect myself for expensive items' steps when selling which includes photographing/weighing and documenting my whole packaging process before posting at the post office that day and getting a postage receipt (spending £3.30 more than the buyer paid for shipping so it was fully tracked and insured).

I sold a video game console bag and game to a different Russian 2 days later on the Monday, and didn't think anything of it. As it was a low value item, I paid the normal postage, and took some photos of the packaging (but not as thoroughly as I do the more expensive package). I posted that day with standard postage and again got a receipt.

Comes to a month later and the the first buyer opened a 'not as described' case against me. She sends me photos of the package I sent her unopened (first sign of a sketchy actor), then pictures (cropped and altered) of the cheaper bag and game inside the packaging (which of course looks similar because I use the same packaging items) saying that's what she got in her package instead of the expensive games. For the record, if these pics weren't cropped and altered it would obviously show I am right, but she's ignoring my requests to send the originals.

I immediately check all my information (receipts/pictures etc) and realise this is a scam. Have plenty of proof and have found these 2 idiots live about 2 hours drive apart in Russia, and the one that lives in Moscow is from the town where I sent the other item. Call ebay and try to get some help. They provide none. I have spent several hours and gone through at least 15 help desk people, none of whom seem to want to actually help.

It's now 12 days later and eBay is insisting I accept the return from the buyer (paying another £12 for the return postage) which is obviously going to be fraudulent. They say that I can trigger an investigation once I receive said items back, and I then may have a 50/50 chance of it going my way (despite all the evidence I have showing I am right/honest, and the fact that anyone looking at it with any common sense would see their side of the story is shady). I'm also aware that at any moment the 2nd / Monday buyer could at any time open a 'not received' case claiming they didn't get the item, given I didn't get tracking so can't prove otherwise. Obviously on this one I can claim with the postage service and get my money back, but that seems wrong and dishonest given I know it was delivered and isn't their fault.

Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how I can get this going in my direction? To be honest it's less about the money (though I'm not going to lie, £45 is a lot to me) than the actual principle of the thing. Frustratingly I keep saying to eBay that even before I get it back I can prove unequivocally it's a lie / scam and if the return goes ahead and I win then they'll have to refund my postage etc, but they don't seem to care they are being scammed and could lose out too - they seem steadfast in their policy of not bothering to look at anything until the return is processed).

Anyone who has been in a similar situation or has advice please pipe up - I'm desperate not to let a bloody scammer beat me!",8,4,2018-06-09,EBAY,0.0601406991481781,0.9082174897193909,0.03164179250597954

Ebay,"Buyer purchased from Azerbaijan Republic, claims he didn't receive. Asking for advice?","After looking over a few things I've come to realization that this was a scam and I might of fell for it, if theres any adv. I'd love to read it. 

I recently sold an iPhone 8 on eBay I have the tracking information that will be listed below. I've never shipped internationally and I was unaware if you ship through USPS and you don't pay for Global Shipping you wouldn't see where the phone or item ended up it won't say delivered. This was my first time shipping internationally. 

The buyer (ruhahm-0) purchased an iPhone 8 from me for $448. I always put in my description towards the bottom will not ship internationally. So I one time decided to pay for shipping and ship it out. I had took pictures of the IMEI on the phone and posted everything for buyers to see. So I did as usual and ship the phone out next day and mentioned I was shipping the phone out. He replied *""Thank you . please leave . positive feedback . A+ . A+"".* Of course he probable doesn't know english so maybe used translate on Google. 

The tracking number UA939404819US through USPS is now saying it stopped at *""JAMAICA NY INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER""* I'm assuming it's customs. The buyer then sent me a message on eBay saying *""I still no receive the phone, did you ship""?* Of course on my side I shipped I just responded accordingly and said *""it looks like it's in customs, shouldn't be to much longer""*. SO I had originally thought, it stayed there for 5 days it seemed like so it started not to make sense. 

I then get a case opened from the user (ruhahm-0) from eBay saying *""Buyer opened case on not receiving item""* I was super confused. So I called USPS and they mentioned the device left the shipment area but since you did not pay for tracking information outside of North America then we cannot track the item. I was so shocked, so I went ahead and checked the IMEI (356707086302924) and the iCloud Find my iPhone was turned on, so in sense it shows some one received the phone and is using it. I came to realization I might of been scammed. 

I called eBay and explained what happened they assured me *""Not a problem thank you for letting us know, and should be able to favor this in your favor""*. Unfortunately the next couple of hours I got an email saying from eBay the ""case was in favor of the buyer, we have pulled the funds from the paypal account on file and the decision has been made due to the tracking number not being valid"". 

I was very upset at this time, I called eBay again and again and mentioned to them the buyer must have the phone (he has only two transactions in his name and I learned he has an open case with another buyer that he bought an iPhone 8 from claiming he didn't receive it also). These are all assumptions but strong ones, but I'm assuming the buyer (ruhahm-0) is taking advantage of the eBay system for not showing the Tracking label saying delivered, it seems like they only favor buyers and not sellers with eBay. 

If you work with eBay and your reading this, if you could help me out at all this would be wonderful, and if you also have ran into this before with ""ebayselleradvice"" I would appreciate any information you give me because I really want to earn the money back that they took from me.

Ebay,Need advice on reporting seller,"So I'm going to report a seller but I've heard the flag button doesn't really do anything. If anyone wants more details please ask, but long story short the DVD player was defective, I sent a message and got ignored so I opened a case. Throughout the case I have proof that:

- The seller lied to me about the fact that he sent a replacement charger

- The seller tried to bribe me into closing the case

- The seller called me names

- The seller threatened to buy one of my items because ""I know it doesn't work""

- Threatened to have his friends buy my items when I told him he was blocked


Would calling in and talking to someone about this give me a better chance of something actually getting done about this guy? Or would it be the same result as if I'd just reported the messages? I honestly can't believe someone would act like that. Thanks to all who respond.

Update: the player arrived back and he sent me a message saying it works and I'll get what's coming to me in life. I don't know if he's putting on a show for eBay or if he swapped the cables, but it definitely wasn't working when I had it. A portable DVD player ain't exactly rocket science, you plug it in, turn it on and pop in a DVD. I'm just not gonna respond to him anymore. I'll call eBay when I get home.

UPDATE 2: I called and they created two separate reports, one for him being a seller and one for buyer (since he was threatening to buy my stuff). Gonna be a warning this time, but they did say their team would evaluate his risk to their business. I actually kind of hope he gets mad and sends me some sort of nasty message. Would love to call eBay right back. A warning seems too light a punishment for all this.

UPDATE 3: Oh, good news! He left me positive feedback calling me a thief. Will call eBay as soon as I can and make sure to mention my earlier complaints.

Update 4: eBay says since this is a second offense he'll probably be hit with a 3 day suspension. They also blocked him from any kind of further contact with me.",9,9,2018-06-11,EBAY,0.06744593381881714,0.897508978843689,0.0350450724363327

Ebay,"How Ebays ""Below Standard"" Status is Designed to Exploit Sellers","Hi, I've been selling on Ebay for over a decade and have over 2400 feedback, 100% positive.  Never paid much attention to seller ratings; I don't do next day shipping so I can't qualify for TRS, and I do a good job so I've never worried about poor performance.  I've just been sitting at ""above standard"" forever.

Last month, Ebay dumped my rating to ""below standard"".  I looked into it and found that over the past year, I had 4 orders out of 1100 where buyers opened disputes and they were closed out automatically by Ebay.  This put me at a 0.36% defect rate - apparently Ebay draws the line at 0.3%.  They were mostly from the Christmas season - I got overwhelmed and my customer service slipped, not making any excuses.  But WTF -I get Ebay orders every day (well, until this month) and am averaging 1 defect per quarter, I don't think that's unreasonable.

Back to the point - when you fall ""below standard"" Ebay really screws you over.  They jack your fees up by about a 1/3rd to 13-14%. They hold the ""defects"" over you for a full year, which means that **only** way you can improve your stats in a short time is to **significantly increase** your sales volume.  Problem is that when you fall ""below standard"" they **cut your traffic in half**.  Here's a screencap of my traffic stats, the dropoff happening the day after my account became ""below standard"": https://i.imgur.com/xAhmvQA.png

For the first time in years, I'm going entire days without an Ebay sale.  I actually went 2 full days without an Ebay sale last week; thankfully sales are still trending up on the other marketplaces I sell on, so I haven't really felt the difference.  But if I was only selling on Ebay, I would be absolutely screwed!

The only way out of this trap is to **drastically discount** ones products in hopes of getting more sales from the reduced traffic.  That's why Ebay raises the fees - normally if you sell a widget for $10, Ebay gets about $1 of that.  If you suddenly have to cut your prices by 30% to $7 to increase sales volume and recover your stats, you're making a lot less money - maybe even losing money.  But at 14% Ebay is still getting about $1 from your sale.

That's the rub. They want to force you to give discounts which makes Ebay's marketplace more price competitive, while Ebay still takes the same amount of money from you.  And because they hold the stats against you for so long, it can take **months** of this to recover.  Months of **you subsidizing Ebay**.  It has nothing to do with encouraging better seller performance - it's just a scam.

I've managed to dig myself out of this another way - I actually had been in communication with the last person that opened a dispute, I had just made the mistake of sending them messages directly instead of through the dispute system. Ebay closed the dispute automatically before I'd gotten it worked out with them; I called Ebay support and appealed the case citing my messages to the buyer, and Ebay reversed the case.  Next month, I'll be back to Above Standard and will no longer have Ebay's finger in my eye. But I'll never get back the lost sales or the money that Ebay is stealing from me this month.

So my advice to you if you're in the same position - get on the phone with Ebay and find a way to get as many of those defects reversed as possible.  Just keep hounding their support staff until somebody over there gives in.  It's the only **real** way to recover.

EDIT: Just wanted to follow up on this. Shortly after this discussion, I took a closer look at my open cases and found that I had been in contact to resolve ALL of them - just outside the dispute system. I called Ebay and successfully got all but 1 of the defects reversed (one was too old).",63,68,2018-06-12,EBAY,0.174736887216568,0.7935816645622253,0.03168148547410965

Ebay,Ebay account permanently suspended,"This is what they sent me:

After reviewing your eBay account, your inappropriate activity has raised serious concerns. As a result, we've taken the following action on your account:
- Your eBay account has been suspended indefinitely.
- Any open cases have been decided as seller wins, buyer’s fault.
- Item listings have been removed. A list of removed items is available further down in this email.

We take several things into consideration before we suspend an account, including account history and any previous actions.

Our actions are based on the following:
- A pattern of receiving both the item and a refund for that same item from a seller. 
- A pattern of filing excessive number of items not received claims. 


I assume the ""reciving item and refund"" is refering to sellers offering me a refund after I gave bad feedback (becaues the items were damanged, not as described, ect). Almost everything I buy is cheap and from China, that is why I also filed many claims for not reciving items.  


I just called and they said there is no way to appeal to have my account reinstated and I can't open a new account.  Even with my explanation, which the woman on the phone seemed to understand and sympathize with.

Now ebay all of a sudden completely new tracking information has appeared show it arrived on the 6th and ebay has declined my dispute.

Ebay,Ebay App: The number of how many items listed and unsold has been replaced by arrows.,"This issue just takes the cake. It's already bad enough that the eBay app is a pathetic excuse I've seen from a major buisness, it's unnecessary changes and stripping this app does that complicates everything. The old eBay app which was more duller but at least it was functional and worked and had extra features such as the HTML editor and bare neccesities such as the option to tick if you want to require Immediate Payment. Anyway, let's begin on this issue.

https://i.imgur.com/QqdxgRQ.png

Active: Arrow

Sold: Numbers

Unsold: Arrow. 

Why? Before Active and Unsold was Numbers too, why did it became into arrows?

This image here shows what my ""Selling"" section looks like now, it enrages me because instead of the arrows, instead it had the number of items I was selling and the number of items that was unsold. Weirdly enough, the items I've sold has been untouched, as to tease me. Functions are the same, I clicked on the arrow and it's the same as before. 

In addition, there's now on the bottom of all that it says ""Scheduled Listing"" which came part of this new shenanigan, clicking on it as you can see in that picture takes me to nothing. This makes sense, because I haven't put any items on scheduled listing, so why has this popped up if 1) I didn't do anything regarding that and 2) If there's nothing to show me in the first place.

The app wasn't updated and hasn't been for the last few months or so, in fact on my other phones this problem has also came up and my friends who also sell on eBay have acknowledged this issue when I asked them if they too got the arrows coming up. Also, we haven't reached four digits on listing and unsold, it's triple digits so therefore the app can easily show us how many items are there as it had demonstrated before this weird change that occurred a day ago.

If anyone can tell me what's going on with this crazy app, I'll be most thankful to you. I'd really prefer to get rid of the arrows and bring back the numbers as it still has remained the Sold section.",7,10,2018-06-16,EBAY,0.10608737170696259,0.8712489604949951,0.022663656622171402

Ebay,"Multiple listing scam, should I be worried refund wise?","On my search for a good deal for a certain video game, I came across a multiple listing for copies quite a bit below what others were selling it for (£10 instead of £18) on an 100% feedback account.

Turns out it was a compromised account, and I got an email telling me to send a refund request, which was instantly accepted.

Ebay,Confusion over cancellation,"Hey Guys,

I'm getting conflicting information and I really need help on exactly what happens when I cancel an item and choose ""Buyer asked to cancel the order."" 

Here's what happened. I relisted an ended item, and didn't realize it had a quantity higher than I had in stock. Then a buyer tried to buy the item, and I realized I had run out. I explained this to the buyer, and gave them a refund through PayPal. I also offered to back order the item, which they agreed to. They seem happy and grateful that I have gone the extra mile.

BUT...I am a little freaked out that I am going to do the wrong thing and still get a defect from eBay. So what exactly happens when you select ""Buyer asked to cancel the order""? 

Does eBay send them a message asking them to confirm or deny it? Is there a button in the message for the buyer to click to do this, or what? 

If the buyer doesn't confirm that they cancelled the item themselves, or if they completely ignore the message, do I the seller still get a defect?

Does eBay monitor ""Buyer asked to cancel"" cases, making this inadvisable from the seller's standpoint?

I would love to get this resolved, but I'm just nervous that after everything, I will still get a defect. Finally, if I have the backordered item, can I just send the buyer that, and instead of cancelling the item in eBay, choose ""Print shipping label,"" ""Mark as shipped,"" or ""Add tracking number,"" and resolve it that way?

Ebay,HUGE UPDATE: Seller's can no longer win item not as described cases!!!,"So, we all know eBay gives buyer's the benefit of the doubt you say it's authentic and show receipts, buyer says it's fake...buyer wins.  You say it's new, buyer says it's used...buyer wins.

In the past if a buyer opened item not as described case, eBay would look at his reason and compare it to the listing and if eBay can call without any doubt that it was listed correctly...seller would win.  Now, item not as described cases are always lost by seller's even if listed correctly.  


Listed sunglasses as damaged with a broken arm...buyer complained about arm broken...he won.  
Listed a variation listing shirts, buyer choose ""red"" at checkout, complained that his shirt was red and not white like the first picture (he didn't pick white at checkout)...buyer wins.

Ebay,Buyer wants to return a dry-clean only dress that they washed in water,"I've sold a handful of clothing items on eBay over the past few months, but this is my first experience with a return request message. I have ""no returns"" selected on my listings. 

I sold a dry-clean-only silk dress to a buyer, who washed it in water. The buyer messaged me saying that she put the dress in water and color transferred to a pair of her pants, and now she would like to return the dress. I responded with a message explaining that the dress was only supposed to be dry-cleaned (as stated on the care label), and that water could damage the texture of the silk, in addition to causing color transfer. I also asked her to send pictures of the dress.

I'm concerned that the improper washing will have damaged the dress, so I would prefer not to accept the return. What is my best course of action here? Do I deny the return request and risk a negative review? Does the buyer admitting to incorrectly washing and possibly damaging the dress (by putting it in water) give me any protection from eBay?",4,7,2018-06-17,EBAY,0.31082358956336975,0.6645392775535583,0.024637112393975258
Ebay,Buyer using someone else’s account?,"I’ve been using eBay for 20 years and have had very few unpleasant transactions. I sold an antique item to someone who claims it arrived broken and dirty. I disclosed a loose piece in photos and description, and, frankly, it looked a little dusty because it’s old. The photos and description also represented that. I packed the item very carefully and well, and it was fully intact upon shipping.

The buyer sent a long, hostile, sarcasm-laden and inappropriately condescending message demanding a prepaid label and full refund immediately. I do not accept returns, but offered a refund upon receipt of the returned item. (And, tbh, if the buyer had just said, “Hey, I got my thing and am a little disappointed because the loose piece you disclosed in the listing broke when I got it,” I would’ve bent over backwards to make it right.) 

In any case, thing escalated. (Because apparently wanting your item back before issuing a return is totally unreasonable.) In one of the buyer’s screeds, she mentioned that she is not the eBay account holder to whom I sent the item, but rather his spouse. Even if she has her spouse’s permission to use the account, is she violating eBay misrepresentation of identity policy? If so, how and to whom would I report this?",1,6,2018-06-17,EBAY,0.10454221814870834,0.8696364760398865,0.02582130767405033

My listing was removed by eBay and I can no longer see it on the eBay app. The user is no longer registered on eBay.

Today, I see that the buyer has opened an INAD case against me through PayPal. The buyer is demanding a partial refund that is more than half of what they paid. They are claiming the iPhone is faulty.

I replied back (through PayPal) with ""Please send the device back and I will issue you a full refund"".

Should I go to the seller, ask him to take the game back, and give me a refund? He has no returns accepted listed on the item. In that instance would I have to pay shipping.

Ebay,Seller is refunding money to an account that doesn't exist,"Hello

The email address I use on eBay is different than the email address I use on PayPal.  For sake of ease, I'll refer to my eBay email address as \[ebay email\], and my PayPal address as \[paypal email\].  Keep in mind that my ebay email address does not have an associated Paypal account

Anywho, I bought a phone, which ended up being a lemon (this was not the sellers fault, just bad luck), and they agreed to do a return.  They sent me $10 to cover the return shipping, however, they sent the refund to my ebay email.

The conversation went like this:

**Seller**: Sorry for the inconvenience, we have refunded you $10 to cover the return shipping.

**me**:  Thank you for the refund, however, I did not see it in my Paypal account.  I noticed you sent it to \[ebay email\], and not my \[paypal email\].

**Seller**:  ""Thank you for your message. we can only sent return postage to your original account you paid for us. ""

**me**:  ""Hello, the payment would have gone through \[paypal email\], I  don't have a PayPal account with \[ebay email\]""

**Seller**: "" Thank you for your message again. Sorry about it , but we can only sent return postage 10USD to your original paypal account you used to pay us. ""

**Me**: ""Hello again, the original account I used to pay you was \[paypal email\].  I do not have any other paypal addresses.""

**Seller**: "" Sorry about it , but we can only sent return postage 10USD to your original paypal account you used to pay us.""

**Me**:  ""The original account PayPal account that I used is '\[paypal email\]'. Transaction ID ############# from June 6th.  You are asking me for the original PayPal email, I give it to you, and then you won't refund it?""

\----------------------

And that was the last message I had sent them.

I'm worried that once they process the refund, they're going to try to send it again to my ebay email address, and not my Paypal.  There is definitely some language barrier between us.  If they try to send the refund to my ebay address, what recourse do i have?",6,2,2018-06-21,EBAY,0.08746060729026794,0.8827084302902222,0.02983090654015541
Ebay,eBay kicked me out as a seller: indefinitely restricted from selling,"Before few days, Ebay restricted my accounts and they asked to provide following info:

\-- A readable copy of your driver's license, front \*and\* back, or other government-issued ID.

\--  A copy of a recent credit card statement, bank statement, or utility  bill. Your name and billing address should be visible, and consistent  with the information registered to your eBay account.

\--  Documentation (including manufacturer's invoices or receipts) that  shows that you purchased the item(s) recently listed for sale on eBay.

I  provided all info they asked for me and sent to them. I thought this is  a just regular process because recently I started to sell more items on  eBay and they need to make sure that I'm a good seller. But after one  day, the send me a mail and shut my selling privileges completely.

I'm  very disappointed with their decision because I selling actively for 4  months, I received more than 30 positive feedback from buyers, and no  single negative or neutral. But obviously, that is not enough.

I  contacted them and asked for an explanation, why my account is  restricted and I was shocked by their response. They didn't want to tell  me the reason for shutting down my selling privileges and that is their  final decision.

Ebay,eBay refund hasn't appeared in 4 months,"Basically back in february I won a bid for a PS4 which I made a thread about back then because I was relatively convinced that it was a scam when the seller told me that it has no tracking.

Well it definitely turned out to be a scam because the seller no longer answered to my messages once I called them out and eBay support stepped in and ended the case in my favour and the money would be refunded.

I have contacted eBay support twice over the course of these 4 months and both times I've gotten a pretty generic answer which basically tells me that the refund went through on their end.

I've checked my paypal account just in case for some reason the money would go there but there's nothing, I'm really just confused how this happened because I've received refunds from eBay in the past and they usually appear almost immediately. It was still a pretty large amount of money for me as I have pretty minimal income as I'm a student.",1,2,2018-06-25,EBAY,0.0698048397898674,0.8878728151321411,0.04232232645153999

Ebay,Absolutely certain I found my stolen property on eBay,"I had my camera gear burglarized from my car when on a trip last week, and now I found a seller listing a bunch of camera gear, including a lot of stuff I lost. The kicker that sold me is he's selling the same camera with identical scratches and markings as mine, as well as a certain lens piece that's missing a special part (very unusual), as I had taken it off before the trip. He also is selling other items that match mine, but I can't prove those as easily (no signs of damage, no serial numbers). My next step obviously is to call the LA police office that took the police report, but is there anything else I can do on my end? Could I appeal to my local town PD (on the East Coast)? Should I contact the seller? By the looks of his page he's a pawn/re-seller of lots of camera gear, has more than just my stuff, so I doubt he's the original thief. 

I need to get the serial number for the camera itself to prove it, but unfortunately the other items aren't as easy to prove. My only hope is if he bought them at the same time as the camera body I could prove they're mine by association (the odds they aren't are insanely slim). When I submitted the police report the officer wrote down the names of some of those items, and I submitted an insurance claim that lists all of them.",27,13,2018-06-26,EBAY,0.05349937453866005,0.9176064729690552,0.02889411710202694
Ebay,"Trying to understand a purchase gone wrong (I'm the buyer, I have the item and the money)","So I bid on a laptop, and I won.  Yay!  While the laptop was in transit though, I saw an ad for the same laptop.  Checking it out, the specs for mine were copy/pasted from this other ad (in another part of the US), and as I suspected, when it arrived the specs were VERY wrong and not in my favor.

The seller was uncooperative on doing the return, and they kept insisting they had no intention of accepting a return.  I opened a case, and after reviewing the emails, eBay of course had none of what he was saying, and they made him start the return process.  I got a return label PDF from eBay, which I intended to print the following day at work.

The next morning, eBay contacted me via email to tell me the seller needed to change the return address.  OK.  He proceeded to just email me the address.  I told him I needed a new mailing label with the new address, and it had to go through eBay, as they would be tracking the return.  He then proceeded to \*refund my money\* despite instructions NOT to do that yet.  This closed the case at eBay automatically, which took away my access to all of the case info, including the return label PDF.  

That was all going on over two weeks ago.  It's well past eBay's return deadline, but I have yet to get a corrected return label.  I tried calling eBay a couple of times but their support line was on hold into infinity.  Also, I'm not sure this is even my problem.  I emailed the seller and he just says he's waiting for eBay to do the label.  For over two weeks?

Is this guy trying something weird?  I have the laptop and the money.  I don't want the laptop, I really want to send it back properly.  It's been in the shipping box in my living room since the day it arrived and I saw it was the wrong specs.  It's a more expensive one, over $1000, so it's in his best interest to get it back.  Should I keep calling eBay and hoping to get a person?  Do I pester the seller more?  Do I just make the thing into a paperweight?",17,6,2018-06-26,EBAY,0.05285763368010521,0.9181010723114014,0.029041273519396782
Ebay,Advice for someone who’s new to selling books Ebay?,"I had started selling used books through Amazon FBA until I realized how much the amazon seller fees were, some were as high as what I sold the book for itself, so I decided to try Ebay, because I heard there are a lot less fees. Final Value fees are no big deal, but what I’m worried about are the Listing fees. Recently I bought around 345 used books at a few estate sales, and I have around 100 listed so far. In the past few weeks I’ve been listing I’ve only sold 4 books. A couple days ago I changed most of my book prices to 99 cents for buy it now and shipping for 3.46, which includes shipping, stamp cost, packaging, and the few cents I paid for the book originally. But the listing price for each book will be 35 cents if they don’t sell, and that makes up a good percentage of what I’m selling each book for. I’m trying to start a store, and I thought I was going to get a few cents in my bank account, but I still don’t see that. I’m just worried the books I’m putting up and plan to put up will take longer than one or two months, and I will just end up losing money again like with amazon.

Ebay,Getting scammed as a seller :(,"A bit of background:

I sold a vehicle programming tool called an OpenFlash Tablet on eBay a few weeks ago. One of the limitations of these devices is they can only be paired with one car at a time. Knowing this, I was very careful to unpair the device prior to the sale. In the listing, I provided photos of the device's screen which showed the serial number as well as a screenshot of the software tool that I used to unpair showing both the same serial number and the unpaired confirmation message.

A day after the buyer received the item, he contacts me saying the device is still paired to another car, rendering it useless. I ask him to provide evidence to support his claim which he ignored.

Another week goes by and he opens a refund request. This time in the body of the request he states that he bought another identical device from Craigslist before he bought mine and it was also still paired to another car. He wants to return the item to me. I have requested the same verification information that I requested above which I doubt he will provide. I am afraid he will send back the item he bought from Craigslist and keep the functional device I sent him.

Is there anything I can do here? If it goes to a claim, I'm pretty much screwed right?",6,3,2018-06-26,EBAY,0.043794699013233185,0.926303505897522,0.029901882633566856

Ebay,"Miscommunication about item, now buyer is threatening","I've been buying and selling on ebay for years, almost always without issue. I sold my old ipad about a month ago. It had slight cosmetic damage on the back cover but otherwise was in excellent condition. The buyer contacted me last night to ask about the size of the ipad - I listed it as 32gb and she was having trouble putting her daughter's shows on the ipad.

I still had the photos on my phone so I contacted Apple customer service and it turns out it's a 16gb ipad. It was totally my fault, I misread the available and used storage and truly thought it was a 32gb (I feel real dumb). Anyway, I offered a return label and full refund or a partial refund. Recent similar sold listings on ebay for the 16gb are about $25 less than she paid, so I suggested a $35 refund if she wished to keep the ipad.

She wrote back that they are on vacation for the next two weeks and she will contact me then if her daughter ""doesn't destroy the ipad"" before they get back. In our 3 messages back and forth, there are 2 or 3 references to the kid ""destroying"" the device and that she will contact me to return it ""if she doesn't destroy"" it first. Now I'm getting nervous that she will file a claim or will return something to me that is not the ipad I sent her (that is the only other problem I've had with ebay in over 10 years - someone filed a not as described claim, got their money back, and sent me back an empty box and ebay told me oh well sorry!).

Ebay,My silly cheap shipping routine.,"I have been doing this for years, and I've yet to have a buyer complain about it, as they probably shouldn't. I simply just do not pay for bubble mailers or shipping boxes. I never will. I save every bubble mailer from an Amazon order, or any other type of bubble paper inside any packaging, and I ask those closest to me to do the same. I also save the brown paper stuff when something I buy is packed with it. A lady I used to live closer to used to save the small brown paper bags the liquor store would put her wine purchases in. 

I sell small items, and I make sure everything is sealed well with packing tape, and the printed label is affixed well. I also make sure I wrap with plain brown paper any bubble mailers I use that have text or logos on them. 

There is never any shortage of this stuff if you're a small time seller sending small items that require bubble mailers. Most boxes can be repurposed too, as long as old addresses and barcodes aren't visible. If you're a big time seller, with an official business affiliated with your account, it may not be your thing, but it has helped me maintain better margins by just a little bit per item, which adds up after a while, and it's less stuff that gets sent to a landfill or recycling processing center overall, so it's ""green"" in more ways than one.

Ebay,Something weird with seller level...,"Anyone else getting the following glitch:

All of the sudden my tracking disappeared for 75&amp;#37; of my items in the last Month.  I now have over 200 items that say ""Tracking not uploaded.""  Tracking was both uploaded and purchased through eBay, now my seller level is at risk of becoming above standard.  The tracking is still there though...weird glitch.

Update on Glitch Theory:  It seems to me most of us will have different zip codes for the item location, and where it actually ships from.  This is probably causing the drop...which is probably not going to be called a glitch on eBay.  So get ready to be moved down the charts.

Update #2:  Just did the math, the percents are exact for me with out of zip shipping.  So 24.2&amp;#37; of the time I use the same zip PO, and 75.8&amp;#37; I use out of zip, but closer, PO.  Same zone according to USPS so no issues with postage differences.

Ebay,Is this seller scamming me?,"So I purchased an item last Friday. That night around four tracking updated to tracking label but usps has not received the package. It stayed that way. On Wednesday (the day before I was supposed to receive the package) I emailed the seller and he told me the package was lost by usps and he'd reship me one (nice if true) he told me the shipping number would be the same as the old one since the other one was lost? Is this legit? I thought once one was created it cannot be used again? What would his motivation to lie to me about this be?

Edit: Checked tracking and it's out for delivery! Thanks for all the insight! :)",6,6,2018-06-29,EBAY,0.02556099183857441,0.8806337714195251,0.09380530565977097

Ebay,Something Fishy About Purchase Need Advice On If I Should Cancel Purchase,I've been selling on eBay a while now and have not had this issue so I thought I would come here. So I had someone buy a decent amount of stuff off me today with a new account which is totally fine. The issue is this person used two seperate new accounts both of which look like they are scam accounts by the name. The other issue is the accounts do not have the same zip code attached to them which seems really weird. If I do cancel am I open to two negatives rather then one?,3,5,2018-06-29,EBAY,0.04299262911081314,0.9129453897476196,0.04406197741627693

Ebay,The Decline In Sales This Early Spring and Summer Is SUCH A Bummer,"I'm not a huge eBay seller, but I sell a real niche item and have done so on eBay for years. I would average $800-$1400 in revenue monthly until Spring and it's been $100 or less ever since. I am sitting on so much custom inventory that it's a little bit stressing. 

I have always tracked sales, month over month, year of year prior, always tracking to make sure I don't stock up too much. Last year was a record year, so I did stock up a little more than usual due to running out so often in 2017 &amp; now it is sitting here. 

I hope and pray eBay pulls their head out of their arses sooner than later, but my gut says the party is over. I know, some would say that was five years ago, but not for me. 

Just venting, have a good day.",28,29,2018-06-30,EBAY,0.08293178677558899,0.860842227935791,0.05622592195868492

Ebay,Buyer requested a return for things that were included in the description,"So I have one of my grandmothers old lenses from the 20s-30s - it’s in great cosmetic condition for its age and has minor issues visually on the outside. However it is still fully operational. I had sent it to a buyer who specializes in the selling of older lenses, at the time I thought I had reviewed the state of its front optic rather well, however he started a return request with me with photos of said optic through a bright light which made the very tiny scratches on that part of the lens very visible. As it wasn’t included in my description of the item I accepted immediately and safely refunded the buyer his money. The buyer said otherwise the lens was in fantastic condition. I have sold the lens to someone new, this time I made sure they knew of the scratches on the front of the optic, but now, 9 days later after they have received their item and I have received the funds for the payment they are claiming that the scratches aren’t the issue which is what was stated in the description, but instead the entirety of the lens is unoperational, I am confused as to how this could possibly happen as I tested it myself with my own camera when it was first returned and there were no problems with it whatsoever. I had went overboard on the packing foam and the overall way I had packed the lens to insure no harm would come to the lens inside of its original leather lens case. the thing barely fit into the box it was so well secured. How do I go about this, how can I get eBay to step in as now my Paypal is of a negative balance and any funds I did have in there outside of the eBay transaction are now unusable. If an authorized lens seller said the only problem with the lens was the small minuscule scratches on the front optic, than why is this guy saying the entire thing is suddenly no longer operational.

Ebay,Really made out good on this promotion today,"Ordered a phone for myself for 265 after the discount, seller said he couldn't ship it for a couple weeks, refunded me..  Ended up ordering a cheaper phone, a google pixel for 175 instead.  Then I found out the coupon was good up to $100 so I ordered a set of tires for my truck from a discount tire place.. Here's where it really gets good.  The tires start at $344 and they send you two mail in rebates totaling $125.  When it's all said and done I paid out 441 after saving $77 with the coupon and will get 125 in prepaid visa cards..  $316 for a cell phone and four truck tires.

Ebay,Suspicious disappearing negative feedback on a seller...,"So I bought an item from a seller with 100% positive feedback, 0 negative. The item hasn't arrived after a long time so I contact the seller asking about it, and I also take a look at the feedback again. I noticed they had ~10 recent negative feedback, with them all saying they have a similar situation to mine - items arriving very late or, as is mine, not at all. I give the seller another week, after promises of a replacement being sent, but still nothing has arrived, and they haven't replied to me for a couple of days now. I just checked their feedback again, and... all the negative feedback was gone. Back to 100% positive with 0 negatives. What the hell? They can't all have changed their feedback. Does anyone have an explanation for why this might be?

TL:DR - Seller used to have 100% positive feedback, then had ~10 recent negative feedback, then all were gone a few days later.",9,4,2018-06-30,EBAY,0.3264484703540802,0.6406195163726807,0.03293198347091675
Ebay,Scammed by buyer - Did I do the wrong thing?,"I accepted an offer from someone for a camera lens I listed. They contacted me outside of Ebay and said they wanted me to send it to Nigeria. It was obviously a scam (found the name associated with a scam online), so I requested a cancelation of the order on the basis that the seller wanted the item shipped to a location I wouldn’t ship to. Then I got confused about Ebay’s fee. Will I have to pay a fee if the scammer responds or accepts the cancelation? Should I have waited two days and then filed an unpaid item thingamajig? Is there a way to cancel the request for cancelation?",2,3,2018-06-30,EBAY,0.4856182634830475,0.49658453464508057,0.01779727078974247

Ebay,Suspicious buyer notice from eBay--item paid in fulll and en route--should I do anything?,"Someone purchased an item from me with BIN.  I got a Paypal notice, and the funds are in my PP account.  I shipped it out a day later (Global Shipping Program).  Eleven days later, I get a notice from eBay that ""We had to cancel bids for the buyer, *****, because they aren't registered on eBay""  and telling me what to do if I haven't been paid, if it's already shipped, etc.

But--It's been paid for.  The money is in my account (not on hold, not pending, it's available).  The package just entered the Global Shipping tracking system.

I mean, should I do anything?  All I can think of is that the buyer canceled their eBay account before the package was technically delivered, so maybe that triggered something from eBay?

Anyone experience this?",2,2,2018-06-30,EBAY,0.09114948660135269,0.8836506605148315,0.025199824944138527
