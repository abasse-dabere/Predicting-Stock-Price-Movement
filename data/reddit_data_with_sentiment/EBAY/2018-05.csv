Ebay,"A customer wants to return an item because of a hole in the product, has removed tags - pushing for a partial refund but won't send a picture of the damage.","So we recently sold a pair of leggings to a customer, she has contacted saying she wants a full refund or a partial refund because there is a small hole in the crotch of them. I asked her if she had removed the tags from the product and she had confirmed she had.

I was considering providing her with a partial refund as without tags we'd be unable to sell new even at a discounted price due to the hole in our store, or to return to the manufacturer. 

So I asked her to send a picture of the damage, she then told me that she was unable to do so at the minute because she didn't have a phone, but was getting one later. I waited, so she's supposedly been trying to send me the picture for the last few messages but she apparently cannot send the picture through eBay and asked me for an email address - I declined.

When she's tried to send the picture there is a signature with her email and name at the end of the message so I think she may be replying to my messages straight from her emails rather than through eBay, may have something to do with it.

So she has sent this message:

""basically there is a hole in the seam of the crutch... for some reason eBay won't let me send you the photo. What should we do, shall i return them or can you offer something else?""

So basically I haven't seen proof of damage to the product, she's hinting at a partial refund here and if I say please return the product she has already removed tags and we'll be unable to sell at a discounted price or return to the manufacturer. So we lose out either way.

Finding it difficult to judge how I should proceed with this one, any advice? 

Many thanks!",10,6,2018-05-01,EBAY,0.12830807268619537,0.842326819896698,0.029365066438913345

Ebay,Fraudulent buyer? Never seen this behavior before. Please help!,"Hello everybody,
I was hoping to get some opinions from you guys in regards to a buyer that I am dealing with forcefully after eBay released my phone number to him upon his request. I had no idea that this was possible but this guy was able to request my contact information to ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù the purchase. eBay sent him my email address (which is my PayPal address also), my phone number and the city and state that I live in.

First, I was selling an expensive watch that belonged to my mother. I woke up this morning to an offer that was $1 more than my asking price which was very odd and set off my worry alarms automatically. I accepted to see if they would pay and I thought no big deal if they don‚Äôt. The user created their account less than 48 hours ago with no purchases or sales. Even more alarm bells are ringing in my head.  I heard nothing for a few hours then received the eBay shared my information email. From there he began texting me.

He was desperate to get my PayPal email and asked me to send him an invoice on PayPal for payment. It seemed odd so I maintained that I wanted to stay on eBay and that it was ready to purchase there. A few hours passed and he sent me an all caps message saying he had not received an invoice still. I told him I wanted to stay on eBay with no reply for a few hours until just now after canceling the purchase with eBay and reporting him he texted me saying ‚ÄúI JUST GOT THE INVOICE, BUT NO PAYPAL EMAIL FOR PAYMENT...I WILL LIKE TO HAVE THE PAYPAL EMAIL, SO THAT PAYMENT CAN BE MADE ASAP‚Äù. The invoice he‚Äôs referring to is the request payment invoice that eBay let‚Äôs you send out on their site, I sent nothing offsite. The order has been canceled the invoice was just from prior.

At this point I have stopped replying as clearly something is up, but I am worried for my safety with him having my phone number and my email address which is also my PayPal. 

Please help! How do scams even take place on PayPal? Could the scenario have been that had I gone on PayPal he would have paid, I would have shipped then perhaps his funds would have been unavailable and the transaction cancelled after shipping? I‚Äôve never seen this before.",15,5,2018-05-01,EBAY,0.10194247961044312,0.8747338056564331,0.02332368493080139

Ebay,"Digital items, Paranoia, and where do I go from here?","So I spend a lot of time playing a video game that's currently very popular with teens/young adults. Someone showed me an ad from eBay of someone selling digital items from said game. I was shocked that people would pay for these digital items that I commonly would throw away. So I decided to put an ad up of my own to see if anything would happen.

And to my surprise, people started buying a lot. So I kept putting more ads for digital items up. The sales kept coming in and very soon it was consuming my entire day just keeping up.
Now the more money I keep making the more I feel like something's due to go sideways on me. I've been reading about eBay and their lack of seller protection for digital goods. And I always knew in the back of my mind that chargebacks were a real issue when dealing with these kinds of sales but at the time I was willing to take a loss on a few digital items if it meant the chance to make a some extra cash.

But now I'm starting to grow more concerned by the day. How long should I wait before I spend any of this money to be sure it won't get charged back? I'm constantly feeling paranoid about unauthorized charges, stolen credit cards, and hacked accounts potentially being used to buy from me. I just don't want to get the rug pulled out from underneath me after spending it. What happens in the event of a charge back? Can paypal just suck the money back out of my bank account?

I'm at peace with the fact that I may have lost out on a lot of digital items, but at the end of the day, I haven't lost any actual money- yet. And I want to keep it that way. Advice?

tl;dr: I've been making a large volume sales on low-priced digital items. It seems like a ""too good to be true"" type of situation. Should I cut my losses (or gains?) and get out now?",7,4,2018-05-04,EBAY,0.14737126231193542,0.8182154297828674,0.03441326692700386

Ebay,"Scammer sent me an empty box, what do?","Hi, a couple weeks ago I had sold an item for $280. Some one bought it with what I assume to be a guest account. Buyer paid but PayPal held the money because I am a new seller. I shipped the item without thinking anything bad of it. However, on April 18, when the buyer received the item he opened a dispute on PayPal saying the item was ""not as described"" and that it didn't work. I found this odd because I had tested the item and it was working when I sent it. I responded with the option to have the item returned back to me and PayPal will issue a refund after reviewing the shipping details. The dispute is still under review by PayPal, but today, I received a package that was completely empty, what's more suspicious it that the package had a different name than the one on their PayPal account, but it was shipped from the same address as the buyer.

I can't proceed with an invoice the seller sent me. The original listing was missing the shipping cost to my location so the seller sent me an invoice with the shipping included. The confirm and pay button is grayed out/disabled for me and I also don't see any payment options.

Does someone know what is the cause of this?

Ebay,"Buyer wants to return booster packs after opening them, claims they were damaged.","I sold someone 21 booster packs to an out of print trading card game.  They arrived at the buyer's house, and the buyer then proceeded to open all of them.  Now the buyer is claiming that they arrived damaged, and has opened a case to return the now-opened booster packs.  This opens up a mess of issues, because the packs are worth more than the single cards. And it's now possible that the packs were tampered with, and valuable cards were removed.

What can I do to combat this? It's obviously a very delicate situation.

Edit: To clarify, all 21 booster packs were sealed when I sent them out.  

None were bent like the buyer has claimed. 

The buyer opened all 21 booster packs.

The buyer then opened a return case claiming that the packs were damaged.

Edit 2: Just got off the phone with a customer service rep.  Due to the buyer admitting over messages that they opened the packs of cards (all of them), they have willingly tampered with an item, and lost their buyer protection status.  If the buyer chooses to escalate the case, I will have the cards returned to me. Once I have the cards returned to me, I'll have to contact eBay customer support again and finalize things with them, and confirm that the cards were tampered with.

I have been a Top Rated Seller since the program was initiated and have never had a feedback rating of lower than 99.5 in all the years I have been on eBay.

Lately, with the new, streamlined return policy I have been getting a larger than normal number of returns with the reason being ""changed my mind.""  eBay automatically approves the return and the seller takes no part in the process other than refunding the buyers money once the return is received.

This streamlined policy may be great for certain kinds of items, however, it has made it extremely simple for a buyer to commit fraud.  Here's how it happens.  

The customer used to have to contact the seller to request a return.  Now there is absolutely no contact with the seller whatsoever.  This frees the buyer from any need to interact with the person who actually sold, packed and shipped the item to them.  By clicking a button, the process is complete on their end, they can generate a shipping label, send the item on its way back to the seller and wait for a full refund.

The only problem is that, at least when it comes to used automotive parts, this creates a very easy way for a buyer to commit fraud.  This is what I have experienced three times in as many weeks on eBay.  The process is as follows.

The buyer makes their purchase and pays for the part through PayPal.  They receive the part.  Install the part.  Claim they've changed there mind and are granted permission through eBay for a return without any contact with the seller.  They return the part that was broken on their vehicle (having kept the working part sent by the seller) and receive a full refund.  Effectively, they have stolen a fully functioning part from the seller, who, to add insult to injury, has to pay for shipping the item both ways.

eBay refuses to investigate situations like this. It is their assertion that they were not present when the item was either shipped to the customer or when it was sent back so they cannot know what actually happened.  They make the claim they are not taking sides when in fact, it is exactly what they are doing.  eBay clearly sides with the buyer and forces the seller make a full refund regardless of what proof the seller may possess.

I'll give you one instance, the latest I've been going through.  A buyer purchased a part for their vehicle that would make the difference between the vehicle running or not.  If they were to the point of diagnosis indicating they needed this part, their vehicle was not running at all.  They bought and paid for the part.  It was shipped out immediately.  No sooner did it arrive then I received an email from eBay that the buyer has requested a return claiming they had changed their mind.

First, let me say the part was easy to test with 12 volts and I did test it seconds before I packed it for the buyer.  The part worked as it should.  It was put in a new box filled with bubble wrap so there would be no movement of the part within the box and shipped out.

What I got back was a part in a different box sealed with silver duct tape and absolutely no packing material whatsoever.  The part was banging around inside the box like a child's rattle.  I video taped opening the box.  The only protective packaging was the plastic baggy I always send my parts in and a slip of paper saying the buyer had ""changed their mind.""  I immediately tested the part and it did not work.

I called eBay and spoke with rep and their supervisor.  Both provided the usually story about how they really couldn't do anything.  They suggested I contact the buyer which I did and still have not heard back from.  The bottom line, I'm out the part, the money for the part and the cost of shipping for the part.

Like I said earlier, this had happened to me three times in as many weeks and the total for these transaction is now a few hundred dollars.  

eBay refuses to listen to sellers who have been conducting business on their platform for many years.  It treats its sellers as though they are the untrustworthy ones in these transactions, not the buyers who have just a handful of feedback (26 in this particular instance).

Frankly, I don't know what else to call it but aiding and abetting in criminal activity on the part of eBay supporting fraudulent returns.

I have another one where the part that had been shipped had been marked so it would be easily identifiable in the event of a return.  The part was tested before packing, marked with paint, packed and shipped to the customer.  They received it, claimed it did not work and, again, with no contact with the seller, eBay charged me for the return shipment and the part was on its way back.  I got it, checked for the identifying mark I made on the part before it was shipped.  It was nowhere to be found.  Nor did the part work.  Again, eBay told me there was nothing they could do and that I had to refund the cost of the part and pay for shipping both ways.

I now have sitting on my desk two parts that are not mine, are not the parts that I shipped to the buyers and represent a few hundred dollars that I am forced to give back to criminals that eBay has helped in committing their crimes.

eBay needs to recognize that we're not all selling beanie babies and they can't institute a one size fits all policy across the board for everything that is sold on their site.  If they are going to force us to perform at a certain level, they need to step up their game as well.

I have a return rate of under 1.6% and I can document over a third of that in fraudulent returns.  A relatively small number but a crime nonetheless.  I'm the type of seller eBay wants on their site yet they seem to show no interest in support or protecting me from fraudulent claims.  If anything, they keep making it easier for the fraud to be perpetrated.

Any other sellers out their have a similar experience?",34,11,2018-05-09,EBAY,0.05730148404836655,0.8701324164867401,0.07256607990711927

The response from the seller was that they were busy at work.  Perfectly reasonable, we all have things come up.  A little heads up though goes a long way.  They don't give a definite answer on whether the item was shipped.  The last expected day of arrival comes and goes without the item showing up.  I open a INR case since I still don't have a tracking number.  I wake up this morning to an angry message that the item should be there by Thursday.  Still no tracking number.


If something comes up, please let your buyers know in a timely fashion.  If you mark something as shipped, please actually ship the item.

Ebay,eBay Seller saying she's 'blacklisted' me,"I recently bought a cashmere sweater from a seller. I paid more than I usually would for second-hand clothing but it was listed as in ""Excellent"" condition and looked fine from the fairly-distant photographs. However when I opened the parcel I found that the fabric was bobbled in places, there was a large hole under one armpit which had been sewed shut, and a small un-mended hole under the other armpit. 
 
I politely contacted the seller for a return and she immediately became quite angry (messages all in caps, etc) saying that I must have ruined the item because I didn't like it. She did agree to a refund but seems to have done that by accident. She asked me to cancel the return agreement and bargain with her for a partial refund, asking me  what I'd accept, and then when I said I'd prefer to continue with the full return she demanded I pay the postage myself.
 
I refused to pay the return postage. I explained that I've never had to return an item before and I wanted to go through the proper eBay processes. She then sent me a rude message telling me that she's reported my full name, address, phone number and eBay username to various 'Blacklists' she knows about. I've opened a case in the Resolution Centre but I've been a bit shaken. 
 
Does she even have my phone number? Do such blacklists exist? I've currently got a 100% feedback rating so I'm guessing people won't take it seriously? And in all honestly I would assume it's hot air but then I do know that trolling does exist, and the fact she's got my address has left me feeling a bit vulnerable.

EDIT: eBay seller has apparently 'blacklisted' me on various forums. Is this a real thing?

SECOND EDIT: Thanks everyone for your support. I've now called eBay and reported her behaviour. They read through the messages and said it's unequivocally unacceptable. They'll look back through all of her past transactions.",37,15,2018-05-10,EBAY,0.10128538310527802,0.8681632876396179,0.030551288276910782
Ebay,"Shipping &amp; Item Location, why are these two things allowed to be different?","At times I often want something to ship from my continent due to the time it takes to get to me. In those times I filter my search to match that. But there are plenty of listings I find that list they are on my continent, but actually ship from a completely different continent.

How can I tell? Well, shipping time for starters, but also some listings say they are shipping from this other continent explicitly.

How exactly is it acceptable for the ITEM to be listed on my continent, but actually ship from somewhere else? This seems like a completely false pretense to me.

For example, Item lists as being in the USA, but is in fact shipping from Taiwan. How can it be **IN** the USA if it is shipping **FROM** Taiwan?

I have zero problem with buying things from other parts of the world, just sometimes I'm not okay with the shipping time. And sometimes I am worried about scamming \(in certain scenarios\).

Ebay,"Another Day, Another Lying Buyer","I sell used car parts. Frequently to people who know little to nothing about cars. I also rant a lot, because I deal with a lot of shady people who love to take advantage of the system. Now though, I'm looking to see if anyone has any advice, because right now I'm thinking that my days on eBay are over. It's becoming too buyer-centric to make commercial sense anymore. With the most recent update to the return system, my returns went from 1 to 6 percent with no change to the business, now that buyers can screw sellers without any obstruction at all. So if anyone has advice on handling situations like this, I'd love to hear it.


Here's the case from today. I sold a tail light. The light had a chip in the lens, stated explicitly in the second sentence and photoed in the second picture of the listing. Photos [Here] (https://i.imgur.com/ulRwlun.jpg) and [Here](https://i.imgur.com/KwlqS67.jpg) of the listing and picture. Still, I wasn't surprised when a SNAD return was opened for shipping damage. reAdinG iS hARd. 

[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/N9vnkvY.jpg) the back and forth from the buyer. I asked them to upload pictures of the ""shipping damage"". Sure enough, it exactly matched the photos from the listing. I pointed that out, even going so far as to copy the pictures from the listing into the return. No dice. ""If it was sold as damaged, I wouldn't have bought it"". Or you just didn't read and now you're lying to get out of return costs. 

We go back and forth. They open a case, after I said I'd accept the return under my standard return policy for buyers remorse. eBay immediately sides with them and bills the return label and item cost to my account. 

I call eBay. eBay rep agrees that it's obvious fraud. Says ""sorry man, you just have to deal with it. I know that people can take advantage of the system, and that's obviously what's happening here, but there's nothing I can do"". That's a direct quote.

The system is clearly broken, and it's not getting any better. So for high volume sellers, how do you handle this stuff? Why did I pay eBay $40,000 last year if this is the best they can do?

Ebay,"""Ebay Storage"" Question.","Hey everyone,

So my buddy is looking to purchase a motorcycle. He came across one on Ebay for a really good price, almost too good to be true. After further discussing with the seller, she claims the bike is in Ebay's possession \(she travels for work, so won't be present\). She says that through Ebay, the bike will be shipped to his door within 48 hours and he will have 5 days to test drive the bike and inspect it. If for whatever reason he is not happy with it he can have the bike shipped back \(return it\) at no cost to him whatsoever. Ebay will hold the money he pays for it and depending on his discussion the money will go back to him or to the seller.

If this is the case, I told him to go for it, it sounds like a foolproof plan. However, I've never heard of this type of thing happening and I couldn't find much about it online. 

Basically what I'm curious about would be, is this a legitimate practice with Ebay or is it some sort of well done scam. It seems fairly fishy to he and I, but if it is actually all done through Ebay it seems much safer.

Thanks in advance!

Ebay,"Bought a ""like new"" phone, phone had very heavy uses, tons of scratches, INAD. How is it looking for a refund from ebay","So last week, I ended up getting a smarthphone because a family member had a small accident with the phone and it was time to replace it.

So I go to ebay I went with a seller that had this phone for a decent price, 100% rep, showed okay pictures, free shipping, item was described as 9/10, no scratches or dents. Condition listed as ""Manufacturer refubrished."" at the top. Good, I buy it.

It came today and lo behold, it's a nothing like the picture. It looked like it was being opened from the bottom, plenty of dents and scratches on the top, the power button had the paint peeled off and the camera looks ready to come off. Came with a white cable turned yellow that you can get from Walmart. No charger. No to mention it came in a box of foam.

I open a return, put in the pictures and put the reason as ""Item Doesn't match description or photos"", citing that the description reads

&gt;The phone looks like new. No scratches and dents. Unlocked and work in perfect condition. Good shape 9/10. Come with cable and charger.

At this point it's pointless arguing, he tells me I'm not turning the phone on the phone and that it's a brick that I have, I put a picture of it on, then he tells me I dropped it, one look tells you it has been like this for years, then he says that he never said the phone is new.

Doesn't matter that he put it that ""it's like new"", and ""no scratches or dents"", he failed to mention that. I have mentioned like 20 times that I want return it because it doesn't match photos or description. Not because it's not new He got super defensive, called ebay and submitted his own pictures and tells me he will wait for their decision.

At this point I call my bank, let them know and they started a claim (if this messes me over, welp, my bad).

Question is, how is it looking for an Ebay decision considering the seller provided his pictures vs mine and he has 100% rep?",8,7,2018-05-13,EBAY,0.03204331919550896,0.9294296503067017,0.03852703794836998

Ebay,How do I modify the shipping price after an item has sold?,"It has been years since I've sold something on eBay so I don't remember the process after an auction listing has sold.

I listed an item for auction and offered worldwide shipping at a flat price and eBay offered $65 shipping, so I just set it to that not thinking I'd get many international bids anyway. 

Someone from Canada messaged me last night asking if I could offer a lower shipping price and I of course said yes. I tried to add $20 shipping to Canada as an option on the listing, but they said they couldn't find it. They said they would still bid but asked me to put $20 shipping on the invoice if they won. 

How does this work? Can I just modify the shipping afterwards if they win? This person has a lot if reviews so I don't think it's a scam. Also, I realize $65 to Canada is a rediculous price.",16,3,2018-05-13,EBAY,0.040392737835645676,0.9102044701576233,0.049402788281440735
Ebay,"Bought phone with warranty, no one honours it","I bought a Nexus 5X under a year ago and after an update my phone has bootlooped, , hardware malfunction, won't turn on anymore it's a common fault with the phone I've gathered. I bought it off eBay off an Australian(which is where I reside).

I contact LG Australia. They told me that the serial number for the phone that I have is for a German phone, and because of this, they cannot honour the warranty, and that I should contact the seller.

After some time of the selling ignoring my messages, I contact eBay. They tell me that it isn't their responsibility, they only offer 30 days of buyer protection, they give me the sellers personal phone number. I message this and still, no reply. I then find out that the seller has blocked me on eBay. I tell eBay about this. Again not their responsibility they don't care. This person is still even selling mobiles on eBay and they don't want to do anything about it. Business as usual.

I contact Paypal. They're great, they tell me that a dispute has been made and that, in 10 days time, if the seller does not reply to me I'll get a 100% refund. 11 days later, I still hear no word. I contact Paypal. They lost all my information but after a long phone call with a helpful lady who found my case, they tell me that Paypal is not responsible for arranging this because the transaction happened over 180 days ago. The original Paypal person knew this, apparently as soon as he submitted the dispute, the system automatically rejected it because it was over 180 days ago, and they sent me an email to inform me of such..... which I never received. Yes I checked my junk folder. 

I contact consumer affairs. They tell me that the seller owes me warranty as that's what I bought, but tells me that since they don't actually know who the seller is, they can't really do anything to enforce the seller in honouring the warranty.",11,2,2018-05-13,EBAY,0.1156376302242279,0.8601391911506653,0.024223174899816513

Ebay,Question about return for low value item,"I recently sold some shoes for $25, shipping was another $15 on top, and my Ebay seller policy is 'no returns'. The buyer filed a return request anyway stating that the 'item was not as described'. To quote him directly, ""They fit like a 9.5 or 10"" (the shoes were size 9). Of course in the listing I stated ""if you need sizing advice, let me know and I'll help."" And yet I still feel like Ebay is going to side with this guy who bought size 9 shoes, received size 9 shoes, but owns other size 9 shoes from a different brand that happen to be smaller than these ones. If that happens I'll have to pay the $15 return shipping, **plus** refund the original $40, then try to sell them again. So should I just refund this person's money and tell him to keep the shoes? My 'profit' on the whole thing if he ships these back will be like $5 unless Ebay sides with me.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and thanks in advance!

UPDATE: I called eBay, got to customer service within seconds, and the person on the phone was extremely friendly and helpful. That's the good news. Unfortunately, she readily admitted that there is zero chance they would side with me on a dispute. After describing the situation she recommended that I offer a half refund and allow him to keep the shoes, because if he escalates the case I will definitely have to refund the entire amount plus return shipping.

Ebay,eBay seller has a meltdown,"TL;DR

I'm told to put a charger up my ass, and that I'll forever be poor in my basement apartment

### Buyer/Seller: Auction won Monday

### Buyer: Pay via Paypal immediately Monday

Note: Unknown to me until I called eBay Saturday evening, Paypal held the funds for a while because the seller is a new seller. Probably inciting the meltdown to come

### Buyer: Wednesday 4PM (probably soon to ask this, but I was excited)

Hi have you shipped / when will you ship? Thanks

### Seller: Wednesday 6:20PM

latest tomorrow. waiting for traffic to die down then microsoft store. ive tried wiping this damn thing 4 times. i could send it to you but it would always have my login showinglol. i promise latest tomorrow and ill choose the fastest shipping that is cheap. tracking etc.

### Seller: Wednesday 8:00PM

at microsoft store the usb was disabled in the bios to be bootable. so its at 16&amp;#37; wipe. will try to make it to canada post today.

### SHIPPED

### Seller: Thursday 11:53AM

Should be there tomorrow. it has a fresh install from     microsoft store. Please take your time and test it all out. The guy from     the store offered me 650$ after I showed him the Ebay so if you are unhappy     I can probably take it back and sell it to him.  

Once you are satisfied please leave feedback asap so I can access the funds     from paypal but obviously test it out. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see its all mint.     usb, ram, etc. even the battery should be almost new cause it was barely     used. 

### Buyer: Thursday 3PM

Thank you for the prompt shipping. I will leave feedback soon after I check everything out. 

It's good to hear the battery will be in good shape.

Hi any news? I hate to be a bother     but I went out of my way to send ovwrnight. So I‚Äôm out 40$. Now you didnt     leave feedback yet. so thats the weekend gone. monday it wont clear tuesday     finally then 3 more days to get the money out of paypal. If you want to     return let me know. But i feel I‚Äôve left you ample time to test and I see     you signed for it. let meknow.

### Buyer: Saturday 3PM

So I've been delayed because the pen needed a new battery to be tested and the charger was damaged. Out of fear the charger would damage the machine I felt I had to go out and get one. This damage was not in the original listing. On top of this, I have been busy and haven't had the time to complete the rest of the checks. I'll likely be done this evening. 

Shipping was listed as free and I did not ask for express shipping. Also, I would pack it a bit tighter next time, there was no damage but sometimes boxes get thrown around. 

Otherwise, everything is looking fine and I'm happy about the machine. The only unpleasant surprise was the charger

### Seller: Saturday 3:16 PM

Hey no worries would you be interested in a return? I would be happier selling it to someone who is ecstatic with the price and all. I can return funds right away. let me know. I definitely dont want to wait for your testing. thanks, 

wasnt aware of any charger issues. thats a new charger feom microsoft they recalled the original. not sure what to tell you. I‚Äôd really prefer a return to be honest.

### Seller: Saturday 3:18 PM

If you can send it back today. I will give you money for shipping and an extra 20$ for trouble. I think your thouggs on the laptop are fair for sure but absurd at the price point. thanks

Ebay,Refund for item held in customs,"I recently sold an item to an international buyer.  The item is being held in customs in the buyer's country for a little over a month now.  The buyer is asking me what to do in this case.  I have emailed the customs office in that country and they told me that the receiver of the package should have received a notice from the customs office on how to receive the package.  I forwarded the email to the buyer who says he never received a notice.  I asked him to try to call the custom office since the time difference is 12 hours between our countries.  He says he was not able to get through.  I tried to call as well as was not able to get through to anybody.

I emailed the customs office again to ask what to do if the buyer never received a notice and they responded with the same response as before that the receiver will receive a notice.

The buyer now has a dispute opened in PayPal and I'm not sure what to do.  I understand that the buyer should be refunded but at the same time I don't want to end up out of the money as well as the product.  I can escalate the issue to PayPal, but I also don't want it to seem as though I am just being difficult and don't want to refund the money.  I don't sell on eBay often so I don't want a negative mark.  

What is the best course of action for this?",15,8,2018-05-15,EBAY,0.07686722278594971,0.8968610763549805,0.026271700859069824
Ebay,Update to return questions,"[Update from this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/8if4kd/ebay_return_question/)

So he did send a new controller, but more of the same. Works straight out of the box, but I'm guessing once the battery goes dead it will not take a charge as well. The reason I say this is because I placed the battery from the new controller in the old controller and the old controller worked just fine, while taking the battery from the old controller and plugging it into the new controller. More of the same, new controller wouldn't turn on or take a charge. 

So I requested a refund from the seller. Honestly I'm pretty sure the controllers are knock offs. They work out of the box, take a charge out of the box, but at some point the battery stops working. Shame too, because they're really nice knock offs.

Ebay,Seller needs help with eBay customer service that has gone off the rails,"I have a serious problem with this company - I sold a bunch of video cards, all of them arrived fine to buyers but one. The buyer claimed the item arrived damaged. Despite being on eBay since 1999 and never having bad feedback before (although not a high volume seller), they instantly bad feedbacked me and requested a return. When I indicated to them to please comply with UPS declared value insurance, they never replied. My deadline to do something regarding the return was May 10th. I contacted eBay on several occasions and received all sorts of varying responses about what to do - since the buyer was non-communicative. The final recommendation on the 9th, from eBay CSR, was to approve the return, expect the item NOT to be returned, and then escalate the issue. That is what I did, in good faith. By this time, on the 11th, the buyer had refused inspection of the package with UPS, and returned the package about an hour later via USPS pre-printed eBay label. They literally threw taped the label to the top of the same box, put repackaged the box with no padding, and sent me back a $500 paperweight. THANKS! So I escalate the issue with eBay, and guess what? They find in the buyers favor. Then I call eBay back, and guess what? They say, the buyer was actually at fault, we are going to reverse this decision. You will get an email in about an hour or two and within 24-48 hours your funds will be credited. Now I am on the phone with eBay appeals AGAIN, and they have ""no idea what that happened"" yesterday, have no record of the decision being reversed. Now, I am explaining the situation to them again.

Ebay,Soo USPS lost my sale.. Now they're running me in circles. Some advice?,"hey guys, so I've been selling on eBay and other platforms now for about 6 months. it's been going pretty good and i'm steadily increasing sales and profits but I'm having an issue with something that happened a little bit ago.


So I ended up selling an old console bundle for $100 USD shipped thru Priority in a box, not flatrate. I had to send it to the other side of the U.S. so it ended up costing almost $40 to ship. That's cool, still profiting.


Come last Monday, I get a refund request from the buyer stating he never received the package. So what I end up doing is checking the tracking # and it ended up as Dead Package/Sent to Recovery Center


I'll wrap this up, I sent a request form to the recovery center so if they find the console they will send it back. That's okay I paid next to nothing for it, if it's lost I'll live.. 

What bugs me is it's almost freaking impossible to get a refund for my shipping that I paid for.. The package never got to it's destination, and now it never will, yet I've still had to pay $40 to get it sent, and since I had to post the refund this is coming from my pocket now...

The store told me to call Customer Care. After a 2 hour wait they told me that this would be handled by filing a claim online. Makes since so I went online.

Once I got to the claim page, there was never any mention on there for reimbursement of shipping, only a process for them to pay for the item(s) they lost once you provide a proof of value. Again, I don't give a damn about the console and I may get it back eventually so I know this is not where I need to be.. so I searched the site more and found the refund page, however when I put in my tracking # it says it's not eligible for a refund because I didn't have any add-ons. Out of sheer frustration I decided to handle it in person, since the website states I can apply for a refund in any of th post offices.

Go to the post office this morning, and the dude seemed quite annoyed by me inquiring about this whole situation, stating that they don't have any such ability in store to do refunds or look up any Info on my package. He said I need to do this on either the website or thru customer care, both of which are not working for me..


Soo has anyone had this happen to them here as well? I feel like this is some big old loop of inconvenience designed to just make people give up on getting a refund and they won't actually do it otherwise. Anybody have any suggestions on what I can do next? My only option is to wait till I get off early tomorrow and speak to a Post office manager when I get the chance.. I really don't want to but there's no way I'm letting them steal that $40 from me for a service they never provided...

So this prompt me to go on a major password and email change. My eBay was connected to a email I only use for eBay, my PayPal is a separate one. I also changed my password on eBay for good measure. 

I check my addresses on eBay too and someone changed my primary address and number to some apartment in California. They used my name as the person too. 

I've checked all my bank statements and PayPal and don't see any purchases that actually went through. The last thing I purchased was like over a week ago too so no new purchases will be going to that address. 

Im just wondering if I need to report this to eBay? I already did a lot of the recommended steps to locked my account down. I think I'm in disbelief because I never had someone get in to any of my online accounts before. I think they were hoping I had a credit card attached to my eBay (which I would never) or that ebay and PayPal password were the same.",0,2,2018-05-18,EBAY,0.07280463725328445,0.9018605351448059,0.02533484250307083

Ebay,"First for me, a Paypal/eBay user for 17 years","History: I have been on eBay for years now..im not a big timer, but have a 2300, 100% positive feedback account. I have decent balance in my Paypal account. No past fraud incidents. No issues/suspensions at all with either account.


Last week: So every now and then, eBay will have some gift cards for 10% off. This specific one was Southwest as I will be booking a flight with them shortly, so I figure why not save 10% on the flight. These were also being sold directly by Paypal Digital Gifts so no typical gift card scam is possible. I go to checkout, and I get a notice that I need to contact Paypal customer support for payment.


I call them, they have me answer multiple questions to verify my identity just in case. I try again to purchase with them on the phone, but I get same response. They tell me the system might need to update, so try back in a few hours. I do so, and get the same result, so I call back. Within 20 seconds on being on the phone the 2nd time, this is literally the reply I got:    


Paypal: ""yeah this transaction wont be able to go through.""    

Me: ""uhhh...??""    

Paypal: ""there is no way I can make this go through. It has been flagged by our security measures.""    

Me: ""Um I have verified it is me. Everything is legit, and these are Paypal gift cards. There is no potential for fraud. LET ME USE MY FUNDS!""    

Paypal: ""Not possible.""    

-this repeats a few times because I am absolutely dumbfounded-    


So in the end, they say they can do NOTHING to bypass this ""security measure"" which is still beyond belief. They basically admitted they have no control of funds even after I have confirmed it is me. I was only hopeful that they could pass my issue on to someone above them so this doesnt happen to other users (I wont hold my breath.)",26,15,2018-05-19,EBAY,0.05222487822175026,0.9225419759750366,0.025233138352632523

Ebay,Buyer Scam - PayPal Dispute for Unauthorised Transaction,"I'm pissed.

Someone has filed a PayPal dispute for 'Unauthorised Transaction'. They are from a foreign country \(paid with Euros according to PayPal, I'm from the UK\) but used a package forwarding service \(Address:  Eshop 10698900 700 Avenue West, Skyline 120 \- which is a package forwarding service\).

I only saw the dispute on the final \(day due to Hotmail marking the emails from PayPal about the dispute as spam\), but had time to reply before it automatically ruled in the buyer's favour. I added the tracking information indicating that it was delivered before the person even opened the dispute, I also mentioned that they had used a packaging forwarding service meaning they were not covered for buyer protection.

But I called PayPal and they informed me that since this was an Unauthorised transaction **filed by their bank, not through PayPal**, we had to ""work together to win the case"" and that it may take up to **60 days** to do so, meanwhile my **funds are held**. The lady from PayPal said they *""clearly knew their way around the systems""*.

The trouble is, how does this in any way concern me. *Even if it was* an Unauthorised Transaction, **I'm not responsible for the buyer's eBay/PayPal account security**. I don't set their secure/insecure passwords!

I have submitted an ActionFraud form to the National Fraud &amp; Cyber Crime Reporting Centre, hopefully its reference number used in the dispute will be enough to scare the buyer into closing their claim.",5,2,2018-05-19,EBAY,0.06281661242246628,0.9087818264961243,0.028401503339409828

I just joined eBay a few days ago and I am trying to sell a few items that are worth about $5.

Ebay,"I won an item, I was the only bidder, but seller says he's going to cancel because it sold for too low. What could I do?","Hi, haven't been on this sub in a while. 

I saw a bid of a huge lot of things and was determined to win. There was a BIN price and a bid and it was up for a week. The listing looked too good to be true, a whole bunch of stuff for a $150 starting bid and $450 buy it now. I asked what was included and didn't get a clear answer but knew that it was everything in the pictures, some things were cut off.

From scrolling through ebay, you wouldn't be able to see ALL the items you're getting unless you look through all the pictures, so I knew no one would bid on it except me. Only 2 were watching.

A week passes, and I wake up till 3 am just to bid, and I won and paid immediately and went to sleep.

About 2 and a half days later, the seller messages me saying that he'd have to cancel the listing and i'd get my money back because it didn't sell for enough money. I asked why he didn't tell me earlier and why there wasn't a reserve price.

He just said that he was away and that someone lists stuff for him and """"""forgot"""""" to put a reserve even though none of his listings have reserves. He also responded to me fairly fast and made sale so i'm sure that's a lie.

Anything I can do? Obviously I can't force him to sell it. I hear sometimes the seller requests to cancel. Should I deny it? Will I still be refunded for rejecting a cancellation? I was thinking of personally calling eBay and complaining about this person, since eBay looks at messages for reference and can see that ""he didn't get enough money for the item considering how much he invested.""

I hear the search listings and 'best match' go by feedback algorithms. His feedback will be below 90 percent after I leave mine.

Ebay,Need help about a never shipped item.,"I purchased a jacket on May 10th from Pennsylvania. The estimated delivery was May 16th. Before purchasing I was talking to the seller non stop. He was being awesome by answering all my questions and sending pictures. On May 13th I noticed it still hasn't been marked at shipped so I contacted the seller and he said he was busy at work and would ship the next day. May 14th still not marked as shipped. I wait and contacted the seller a few more times around May 17/18th. This is one day after estimated delivery and the item still wasn't marked as shipped.  The seller stopped answering all of my messages. I eventually filed a Did Not Receive case against him around May 19th. It is now May 21st and even with the Did Not Receive claim he has not reached out to me. It has been 11 days since my initial payment. I know it shouldn't take this long to ship because he is located only a 2 hours from me. I have bought things from California on the 16th and already received them. This is becoming worrisome and suspicious. Please any ideas or input?

Due to the nature of flipping this inventory and especially with electronic products (which are the bulk of profitable Amazon returns that are being sold) many sellers fail to adequately test these items for functionality.

At best, you get a lightly used open box item. At worst it's defective.

It is difficult to detect whether the item being sold is an Amazon return. The only way is if you see on the item's packaging the following label:

https://imgur.com/a/jc79xUo

Many sellers remove this label but it's still easy to see the residue that was originally covering the Amazon or UPC code of the packaging.

The silver lining in this situation is that every seller that has sold us a defective Amazon returned item has given is an instant refund with no return necessary.

Hope this helps :)",10,21,2018-05-23,EBAY,0.07645881175994873,0.868914008140564,0.054627176374197006
Ebay,"Buyer sent back fake package and paypal sided with buyer, what do I do?","I sold a pair of jordans about a month ago, everything went smoothly. Payment received, shoes shipped out next day. Then when the buyer receives the shoes, he says they are fake. I say well, they are not fake, he can take them to any footlocker and they will confirm they are authentic. He stops replying and starts a return for item not as described. I am annoyed, but what can I do? So I let the return process start. He ships me an envelope with random papers inside.. I contact ebay and they say don't worry, we'll take care of it and will not refund the buyer. The buyer's account is not even registered anymore and will not reply to me at all. Paypal sides with the buyer and now I'm down 215$ and a pair of new shoes. I tried to appeal it, but what else can I do at this point?¬†

I filed a police report and a ic3.gov report. Is there anything else I can do? How would paypal not side with me? It's a class 4 felony to file a false police report, so obviously I wouldn't risk being charged with a crime over 215$... I'm a newly graduated college kid who is unemployed and just trying to get by, by selling some stuff and this is how it goes.. Just my luck.¬†

Tl;dr: I sold shoes, the buyer sends me back papers instead of the original shoes and paypal refunds them. Lost 215$ for some random papers. Filed police report and everything, what else can I do?¬†

EDIT: Ebay told me earlier today that they would pay off my negative paypal amount!!! Thanks to everyone for trying to help and giving me any kind of input, I really appreciate it. So for anyone in my situation where the buyer scams you \(I really hope this doesn't happen to anyone, it was a pain in the ass\), you have to call ebay and paypal and tell them everything, give them as much proof as possible. For my situation, paypal would not listen to me for whatever reason. I then kept calling ebay support and after what seemed like forever, they said that they would pay my negative. In their own words, this was a super rare case and would be a ""one time courtesy"". Obviously, I doubt ebay wants to cover your losses every time you get scammed, even if they did say I was covered to begin with.. In the end, I'm a tiny bit salty, because the kid got free shoes and kept my money, but at least I got my money back. I know karma will get that kid someday anyways. 

TL;DR: Ebay gave me my money!! I still hate paypal, because they didn't side with me after all my evidence and police report. The kid got free shoes in the end, but at least I got my money.

Ebay,Feedback Etiquette - Is Neutral or Negative Feedback for Seller Warranted in this situation?,"I am a VERY infrequent eBay user and in the handful of purchases I've made in the last dozen years or so have all been great / positive feedback. However about a week ago I purchased a vintage Stanley No 7 hand plane, it's an 8 lb hunk of cast iron 24"" long meant for shaving wood. Although sturdy, it can't stand up to being dropped on concrete without damage.

I bought the item, paid right then and there. Seller shipped next day, item arrived promptly. No problem so far. However package was dented, and on opening I found that the tool was completely destroyed, it broke in half and the two halves further damaged the other parts of the tool. 

The good: Pics taken, message sent to seller, and he agreed to refund. He repaid my full purchase + my return shipping and items were sent back.

The Bad: the packaging was awful. The guy simply put the tool in a flat rate box with crumpled paper bags and newspaper. The box was too large compared to the tool size and there was nowhere near enough packaging so the tool was free to flop around in the box. Furthermore, due to the misfit the box was severely unbalanced (probably how it was dropped).

In my opinion the seller severely under-packaged the product and wasted my time and energy. I lost the ability to bid on other quality tools because I thought I had one in good condition. I now have to spend even more time hunting for a replacement item.

Here's my question: What is the etiquette for this situation? I think the common person would agree the packaging was woefully lacking, however the seller did refund me. My only real gripe is the annoyance and time wasted.

Should I leave some form of feedback to caution other sellers of poor packaging for delicate tools and/or to impel the seller to properly package things in the future? Am I being too harsh? I would appreciate any thoughts.",14,6,2018-05-23,EBAY,0.249532550573349,0.7149162888526917,0.035551197826862335
Ebay,How long should I wait for seller to ship before being concerned?,"I won bidding on a phone last Tuesday and estimated arrival date was on the 21st. Most of my ebay items have arrived quickly in the past but this one hasn't even given me a ""your item has shipped"" e-mail yet. 

To be completely honest I think I'm just slightly more antsy since it was a higher priced item. I understand things don't always work exactly as listed such as delivery dates but for it to not even be shipped yet seemed somewhat odd. Is this actually a concern? Should I message the seller? If so, what should I say? I don't wanna sound like a jerk. 

Also, the shipping rate was around $10. This is the most I've paid for shipping on eBay before but it's taking longer than any other items. The item is shipping from within the same country (U.S.), is it right to have to pay that amount but wait this long or is it a fair rate regardless of my wait time?

Sorry for the rant, I truly want to be patient and respectful that's why I wanted to check with experienced users first, but I'm also concerned. I looked up some information on ebay's site from the sidebar but it got a little confusing when it discussed payment receiving info on their end. Made it seem like they can wait awhile to send my stuff since the payment may not post for a while.

Ebay,Buyers not paying!!!!,"I recently completed a 10-day auction on a used DSLR camera body. It ""sold"" but the buyer (buyer #1, located in the UK) didn't pay and didn't respond to me or the unpaid item case. Case is now closed and they have a strike. 

I re-listed the item and after a 10-day auction it ""sold"" again. But again, the winning buyer (a different person - buyer #2 in California) did not pay, giving a very vague excuse about a PayPal problem. I gave a second-chance offer to a 3rd buyer (buyer #3 also in California), and this buyer accepted the offer, but has not paid. 

Buyer #3 is very suspicious - both buyer #2 and buyer #3 have Vietnamese names and they live in adjacent zip codes in Orange County, California. I'm guessing it's either the same person or employees of a reseller trying to game me.

Anyway - how the hell do I sell my camera if the winning bidder is consistently a deadbeat? Why doesn't eBay require that bids be backed with a credit card?

Crisis averted, and all's well! Thanks for all your help!

Pretty much what the title says.

I ordered a package on 5/18. The package was marked ""shipped"" as of the 19th. The tracking info is showing the previous shipment associated with the package and has been since the package was ""shipped,"" which tells me that the seller told eBay they'd sent it, but they actually haven't done so yet.

I messaged the seller on 5/20, but I haven't heard anything from them yet. Considering this package has been ""shipped"" for almost a week, I'm concerned this thing isn't coming, which is doubly frustrating because this purchase was a gift for someone whose birthday was *yesterday.* Based on the seller's location, there's absolutely no reason it couldn't have arrived in time. To add insult to injury, the shipping was a whopping $8 on a $10 item, which I wasn't happy about paying to begin with, but I was willing to deal with it because the item was so perfect for the birthday girl.

What are my options here? Do I need to wait until the shipping ETA elapses to escalate this beyond the seller? If the thing actually arrives, can I dispute the shipping charge and get that refunded to me?

However I am noticing customers are purchasing amounts as low as $6-8 and the 20% off is still applying. I recently had someone purchase a $6 order and get the discount, and then purchase another $3 order and again get the discount.

What I have also noticed is this only affects repeat buyers. For example, this recent buyer had purchased items in the past (over a week ago).

Ebay,Missing Package - Ebay Ruled for Seller,"Hello all,

Ordered a $90 car audio part from Ebay a week ago.  On Tuesday 05/15 I received a notification from Ebay that my package was delivered.  

Upon checking both my Front Door area, and my mailbox there was NO package.  I live in an apartment complex with more than 250 apartments, and I'm quite positive that the USPS carrier placed my package in someone else's mailbox... which is why the tracking is showing as ""Delivered, In/At Mailbox"".

This apartment complex has dedicated mail areas with banks of about 100 mailboxes each with its own key.

Been back and forth with both the Seller and USPS now multiple times, with zero resolution and still no package.  I finally had to resort to putting in a Missing Item Case with Ebay, since the package does qualify for their ""Money Back Guarantee"".

Well, much to my dismay... Ebay ruled in the favor of the Seller within 2hrs of putting in this Case.  The exact message from Ebay is as follows:

&gt;We're sorry you had a problem with your purchase. However, the seller provided &gt;tracking information that shows the item was delivered to your address.
&gt;
&gt;After reviewing all the details of this case, we determined that you won't receive a &gt;refund.

I have no doubt that the Seller did in fact ship this item, but the item was not delivered to the correct mailbox.  This was also shipped FIRST CLASS mail, and the Seller confirmed that it was NOT insured.  It was not my choice to have it shipped Uninsured, this was done by the Seller as they provided Free Shipping and chose the shipping type themselves.

So since I've gotten no resolution from USPS, and now shutdown by Ebay... am I just expected to take a $90 loss?

Any input on this situation would be appreciated.",19,3,2018-05-25,EBAY,0.06149855628609657,0.9065572619438171,0.03194423392415047

Ebay,Looking for Advice Regarding Counterfeit Item,"I received an item early in the week that I knew to be counterfeit quickly upon getting my hands on it. I let the seller know rather than go straight to eBay and the seller offered what is about half of what I paid back to me if I wanted to keep it or offered to refund my money if I wanted to return it. I don't particularly want a counterfeit in my collection so I have no use for the item and don't want it. However I have been under the impression for a while now that posting counterfeit goods was mail fraud and a federal offense, so returning it doesn't seem like a great idea (and the seller didn't mention if I was going to be on the hook for return shipping or not but it doesn't seem like something I should have to pay to return).  

I've yet to reply to the seller because I've been weighing my options and trying to decide what to do. I did contact the publisher of the item I purchased (it's a tabletop game, by the way) with multiple pictures of the item and they confirmed very quickly that it was a counterfeit and not produced by them, and the representative I corresponded with gave me permission to use the correspondence as proof of the item's inauthenticity if I needed to provide it to anyone.  

I know I could go straight to eBay and probably get it taken care of easily. I've read in the past of buyers getting refunded by eBay after destroying the counterfeit item upon eBay's request and then signing an affidavit saying they did so. To elevate it to eBay this early feels like it's going over the seller's head, when I haven't even responded back to their initial offers. And I do appreciate that the seller offered something as opposed to calling me a liar or telling me to deal with it. I don't know that returning it to the seller is the right thing to do though, because of the thing I mentioned about believing it to be a crime to mail it. And I feel like maybe there is a tiny part of me that wants to elevate it so I don't have to deal with any confrontation with the seller over it. But elevating it without saying anything to the seller doesn't seem like the polite thing to do.  
So what is the best course of action?",10,3,2018-05-26,EBAY,0.04732330143451691,0.9224616289138794,0.03021506778895855

Ebay,Ebay seller wants to sue me?,"I had to file a case against a seller because the item did not contain the cable which was needed, and also because it was a first generation product and not the latest model. You also couldn't buy the cable because it would not be compatible and there isn't one anyway.

 

Now I won the case and I got an angry message from the seller:

 

This is about the ludicrous non lawful review and outcome untertaken by EBay.

They have not even bothered with basic contract law or the photos which clearly showed what was for sale.

Thankyou for seemingly misrepresenting what was stated between us. I have made it clear to EBay that I am unhappy. Still we are where we are and as a consequence I shall gladly sue you for the money. The amount in issue is irrelevant.

I will also make enquiries as to how it is that a third party XXXX have paid it for you. EBay should not allow this as it is Contrary to money laundering laws.

This money was for my daughter to go towards her funds for an expedition to Azerbaijan to help people in that region. She has to raise ¬£3,100 to go. She will be 16 when she does it.

For obvious reasons, I won‚Äôt let this drop and it is fortunate that as a lawyer of 30 years I know the ropes and will go to all legal lengths to ensure that you do not get away with it.

First port of call is the company.

So he made a mistake and is now going to sue me?, is this even possible?. Regardless the item was not the right one and I find this very theatening.

I didn't even get a refund until yesterday and I added a comment to the case like ""are you refunding me or just keeping my money captive?"" Until he refunded me FINALLY about a few hours later, but I had to file a case to get the money back. He said he would cancel but did nothing until I opened item not received case yesterday.

I left feedback about him refusing to sell and late refund. He sent messages late in the night cursing saying ""you didn't have to leave negative feedback"" and used a bunch of words like prickhead, fuckboy, crackhead, and also even implied that he was making fun of me because of what I was buying. I was buying a bunch of action figures.

He refused to sell, tried to hold my cash, and sent harassing messages and said stuff like ""I'm glad I didn't sell them to you."" and also ""I'll sell them for cheap, because I can, and want to, just for fun.""

Can I report this scumbag? Call eBay? I can't believe there's human garbage sellers like this on eBay. Jesus Christ. I know you guys told me to engage but damn, I just had to tell him ""I can't believe you're actually trying to debate this feedback.""

Ebay,"Frustrations - Ebay Customer Support, Logs of information being meaningless, and the ability to appeal a restriction being non-existant.","In 2015, I was doing a decent amount of sales on ebay.  In one month, my distributor had lost/damaged a case of product that I had believe I already had delivered. As such, I had to refund about a dozen or so users their money.  Everyone was sent an individual message, was apologized to, and received a refund. I received 0 negative feedback from this, and maintained the highest rating on my account regarding that.

Apparently, this dropped me below a ""defect"" metric, and my account which had previously had no problems, was automatically flagged and targeted for an indefinite ban.  The account cannot be closed, the account can only list 0 items, and $0.00 worth of sales.

I've spoken to ebay yearly since and they claim that this type of restriction is strictly non-reversable and there is nothing they can do.  I told them, had I had warning I was in trouble of being under some metric, I would have done anything to fix it, but I hadn't.

Speaking to customer support is a nightmare.  They're all so incredibly nice, but they're also useless.  They claim hands are tied and escalate my call, and supervisors inform me that they can't believe my logs and information, because they do not maintain their own after 3-ish months, so they have no way to verify what I'm saying.

This was at a point where I was logging into ebay daily, twice a day minimum. I would have noticed any glaring issues on my account that said ""fix this or be banned"", but no such occurence happened, and everyone claims theres nothing I can do.

The worse part is, one of the CS reps told me they wish this happened to me just 6 months prior. They claim restrictions from just 6 months prior are allowed to make appeals. Due to my restriction happening past an arbitrary threshold, I am indefinitely screwed.

Anyone else have frustrating experiences like this?",5,4,2018-05-29,EBAY,0.1601794809103012,0.8131439089775085,0.026676610112190247
Ebay,Highest bidder in in Indonesia. I'm in US. What to do??,"So I chose USPS buyer pays shipping and handling. I don't feel comfortable shipping my graphics card to Indonesia, the price is 50 dollars for shipping and handling.

I don't know what to do, should I cancel? I have a bidder who is in the US, but I don't know how to choose him, he's the only other bidder. The buyer from Indonesia is the highest bidder.

Ebay,Am I being scammed?,"I posted a fairly high value item on ebay. I expected to get a few hundred pounds. The auction was going well and I‚Äôd had some questions from interested buyers. 

Right before the end of the auction there was a flurry of bidding from 0 feedback users. Within 6 seconds one of these users bid 3 times and cancelled the last bid with the message that it was the wrong amount. 

These bids pushed one of the bidders I‚Äôd been in contact with (who has 1000+ rating at 100%) to a bid of ¬£509. After the auction they contacted me saying they‚Äôd won the auction but had seen suspicious activity and wanted to speak to eBay first. 

I replied with the info I had and they suggested the last legitimate bid was of ¬£250 and that they would purchase the item but for considerably less than their winning bid. I suggested ¬£350 and they were happy. 

Since eBay has cancelled the auction due to 2 suspicious users. 

Obviously there was some sort of scam here. I‚Äôm wondering whether it could be the user I‚Äôm dealing with. It seems unlikely as doing this he may have ended up paying more still.

The item in question is large and requires collection. And I‚Äôm only accepting cash payments.",9,3,2018-05-29,EBAY,0.2799642086029053,0.6945502161979675,0.025485621765255928

Ebay,eBay Seller Canceled Order,"Hello,
  
I purchased an item on eBay from a seller on May. 14. Turns out a few days later the seller cancels and does not give a reason, but messages me saying he will refund the money I already paid to him. I paid with my debit card. He send me an image of him sending me my refund to my linked PayPal account, but when I go to my activity on my PayPal, no where does it list a pending $ amount to be received. Has anyone here experienced this? I trust the seller, and the image had my own PayPal username. I just want to know why it does not show  up on my PayPal activity.

Ebay,Handling a freight return,"I'm back again to complain. 

Sold an engine to a guy in California, shipped freight from VA. Long story short, the guy bought the complete wrong motor for his car. Like, not even close. At all. Really not at all sure how you screw that up this badly, but ok. 

Opens a return through eBay, as a ""doesn't fit"" return. At least it's not SNAD, but still a pain. How do I even handle this? I've never dealt with freight returns before. I'm honestly hoping that he has no idea how to handle a freight shipment and it never gets returned.

Also, the engine was a $1100 motor, shipping included. ""Free"" shipping, though the listing states that returned freight items aren't refunded original shipping expenses, I know that won't hold up. Even so, I'll take the 15% restocking fee, and he'll pay the $400 to freight it back, but how is it even economically viable for him to return a freaking Cadillac short block?

I have so many questions. So if someone is out there who has dealt with freight returns before, I'd love to ask you some questions.

Edit for another question: I've debated contacting him and trying to work something else out, because I'll loose $250 on this if he returns it, in freight charges that I can't get back. But I'd almost rather just ignore it unless he contacts me, in the hopes that he gives up trying to figure out how to make it work. So would you talk it out, or just let sleeping dogs lie?",1,5,2018-05-30,EBAY,0.04727020859718323,0.9227063655853271,0.03002341464161873
Ebay,Interesting eBay bug this morning,"Sold items aren't coming through.

Here's what's going on, I logged in to my paypal account this morning and saw way more money than I thought should be there.

Ebay,"16 year Ebay account stolen, what should I do next?","My 16+ year old Ebay account was stolen. Password, email, phone number everything changed.

I contacted Ebay and their support was no help, and wouldn't even listen to me. All they did was request the username which I gave them, then they told me since the current email isn't the one I was providing, they couldn't do anything.

Is there anything I can do such as request someone higher up on the 1-800 number, give up, what? It's not too big of a deal since I dont use it often, but I dont want to be somehow held liable if fraudulent activity takes place on an account that was technically mine.

Ebay,Returning High Value Item. 3rd-party shipping insurance? Please help,"Hi everyone.

The item I sold arrived to the buyer yesterday ($2450 in value + $94.15 in shipping across the country) and was shipped ""insured"" via FedEx Home Delivery and bought the label from eBay. The item arrived slightly damaged as I seen from the pictures he sent. I filed a claim on FedEx website yesterday and the buyer started a return today. I accept it but I didn't print the return shipping label yet (Cost only $15.46 -no idea how!)

I have just read that when you buy a FedEx label on eBay even with declaring the value ($2450) they won't accept the claim (it must be done from my FedEx.com account or linking FedEx/eBay accounts which I just know about it). PLUS if the package returned back to me that will void the claim.

What are my best options in this situation? I have already sold this item at loss but I don't want lose more. FedEx most likely won't accept it as I said because the shipper was eBay. Is 3rd party shipping insurance is applicable if I bought a shipping label outside eBay to return the item back?",13,3,2018-05-31,EBAY,0.061523906886577606,0.9012404084205627,0.03723563253879547

Ebay,Question About Offered Discount Through Ebay Message,"Hey guys, I'm about to purchase Lego Dimensions from a seller in the US (I live in southeast asia). While we're discussing in the ebay messaging system, he was offering me two other items for a reduced price.

The original total price is $90 for the three items, and he was offering me $60 for them.
May I know how is the standard of refund if the conversation is only recorded in ebay messaging system?

Should I ask him to change the price of the three items so the total will be $60?
Or should I pay the original price and then he'll just refund me the $30 through paypal?

I've been sending him messages to confirm this, but he didn't respond.

Initially my plan is: if he doesn‚Äôt reply anymore, I‚Äôll just buy 1 item, and that‚Äôs it. His lego dimensions price is not the cheapest but with shipping cost to my country, it‚Äôs the cheapest.

Let‚Äôs say I buy 1 item from him and he doesn‚Äôt send the item, how many days will I have to wait until ebay cancel the transaction and I get my money back?

I bought around 20 items from ebay so far, but I never encountered people who doesn‚Äôt send the item. So I never have that kind of experience
