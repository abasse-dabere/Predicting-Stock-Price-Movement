Ebay,Advice on how to proceed.,"Here is a little back story for you kind people who want to help me.

About 9 weeks ago i sold an item for a couple hundred dollars. Apparently his package was lost in the mail. So we did the usual dance of me sending him proof of shipping and telling him to wait a few days. As time passed it was apparent that his stuff was lost in the mail. 

So i assumed the worst and kept his payment in my paypal account in case he decides to file a claim against me. 45 days pass and he never filed a claim, so i transfer the money to my bank account.

He messages me every week and asks if i ever got his package sent back to me, which i never did. 

Anyway He messaged me today and he wants me to call him on the phone. At this point i have no obligation to call him. Its been over 2 months now and i no longer have an obligation to talk with him. 

My question is this, is there anyway this guy can screw me over after 60 days?  Should i call him to see what he wants?",3,0,2012-09-02,EBAY,0.09811244904994965,0.8633134365081787,0.038574062287807465

Ebay,Looking for advice on accounting for eBay sales in Quickbooks,"How do you guys account for your sales and monitor cash flow?

I'm at the point that I need to be doing this better: right now I have a big Excel sheet that tracks my purchase orders to my suppliers, my shipping costs inbound and outbound, packaging, materials, and other business expenses.

I've got all the data entered into a new Quickbooks file, but I don't know the best way to structure some of the data. For example, where is the best place to enter eBay and PayPal fees? Can I correlate them to particular sales so I can calculate my margins on a per order or overall basis? I'd assume if so that I could do the same for shipping in/shipping out.

I have a lot of non-eBay sales as well, so these things would only be applied to some transactions.

Ebay,New eBay Managed Returns Process,"I'm really torn about this. On one hand it seems like it would make the returns process easier on sellers.

Ebay,How would you handle this non-paying bidder?,"I’m a fairly new ebay seller and recently posted a Buy It Now listing for a rare boxed video game. It sold within minutes to another ebay seller who has over 2000 feedback and a 97.8% feedback rating. 

I sent an invoice after one day, and it’s now been four days without payment or communication –but before I contact the buyer I wanted to get some input from other sellers about how I should deal with him given a couple of things:


* As a buyer, he’s left retaliatory negative feedback to another seller who opened an unpaid item claim against him (according to the seller’s reply to the negative.) 

* As a seller, he’s gotten a rash of recent negative feedback for not shipping items, canceling and re-listing fairly won auctions, or not communicating. He leaves hostile replies to those leaving him negatives.

If it helps give more perspective, the buyer also has a store which includes listings for similar boxed video games (among other things), and his feedback indicates that he’s paid for other items as recently as today. I suspect he may have bought my item without looking at all the photos and reading the description detailing some box damage.

I want to send him a reminder that in order to recoup my fees, I’d have to file a unpaid item claim (unless I'm mistaken), but because he seems very volatile, I’m wondering what the best approach would be to get my fees back or get paid while minimizing the chance of being hit with negative feedback. What would you do?

Ebay,Friend got jipped out of $250 with PayPal. Any way to get it back? (Story inside),"Basically he sold something that he technically didn't own for money. He sold his video game account. He sold a WoW account of his for $250 to some guy via PayPal. After he received the money he gave the guy his account info. A day or so later the money had been removed from his PayPal. 

Apparantly the guy claimed that he didn't get what he paid for or that his CC was stolen or something and he got his money returned to him while also keeping my dumb friend's account.

I told him that he probably won't be able to get the money back because he doesn't have proof that he sold anything to the guy. No tracking number or anything.

Ebay,I need help!,"Okay, this is going to be a bit long, but here goes.

*Note: Buyer paid through PayPal but is not registered on PayPal, and had no feedback before I left one right after payment was made*

*  Buyer purchases item (8/23)
2. I ship using eBay's shipping labels to the address provided when they made payment (8/24)
3. Package gets a ""Undeliverable as Addressed"" on tracking info (8/27)
4. Buyer messages me (8/27):

&gt; Hey I need to know why my package wasn't deliverable I provided my correct address ..... Something needs to be done immediately the item was a gift for someone now I have to wait another week or so. I called my local post office and they can't do anything they told me the contact the seller so please help and fast ...... They told me its being sent back to sender

* I reply explaining I shipped to his address provided at checkout and pasted his address and asked if it is correct 
* He replies with a different street, different city, same state, and different zip code.
* I reply to him saying I will reship to this new address once the original package gets returned to sender.
* He replies ""how long will it take its a gift for my son""
* My soft spot for kids kick in and I reply ""It will be shipped out first thing this morning. Tracking number is ....""
* So I ship him a new item on 8/28 and it gets delivered just fine on 8/30 using the address he sent me via eBay messages &amp; his name from the original address.
* Then, the very next day 8/31, I get an email notifying me that this buyer opened up a Item Not Received claim through PayPal, not eBay, PayPal.
* Also would like to note: it gets worse. The original package. Sent to CA -&gt; Undeliverable -&gt; Back to FL -&gt; Missent! -&gt; Somehow back in CA


At this point, I have a bad feeling I am being scammed by this guy since he knows I will loose a Item Not Received claim ... or will I? I shipped to his address at payment? I don't know. I am just a seller trying to make sure the buyer gets what he pays for, and at this point the original payment is on hold in PP, one package is delivered, and one package is doing laps in the mail system.

Ebay,Returning an item that the seller would originally not accept.,"So I recently bought a Used MacBook Pro, where the seller would not accept returns but was still covered under the Ebay Buyer Protection.
 
When I got it, I could not access it. After contacting the seller it turns out that it was his ex wife's MBP and that she had most likely locked it remotely via iCloud. The seller was very nice and offered to refund me and pay for shipping costs. I'm not really sure how to go about this, as I still want to protect myself as a buyer and make sure that I get my money back.
 
So how does the return process usually work for cases where the seller originally stated they would not accept refunds. If somewhere in the middle of this process I do not get my money back, will I still be covered under the Ebay Buyer Protection?
 
I would rather not leave my seller negative feedback or open a case against him, so any suggestions to make this process as smooth as possible would be very helpful.

Ebay,"Sold an item 1 month back, now a dispute. Your opinion?","Sold a Tablet on eBay. Today, I got a message from the buyer: The item was as described, except one thing.
The Audio output does not work with a headphone microphone.

I look into it, and find that the listing shows the 3.5 mm Audio Jack as an output, but not an input.

I contact Samsung, and they tell me that the tablet is fine, and it is not built with an audio input through the 3.5 mm audiojack. 

I communicate this to the buyer as politely as possible, and he then opens up a dispute requesting a rebate.

Here is my response to the dispute, please let me know if you think it was not polite: 


&gt;""Buyer-- My assessment of the situation is as follows: The audio input in the item description is described as ""Integrated microphone,"" which you have indicated is functioning. There is no mention of using the 3.5 mm Audio Jack for input, so I believe my listing was accurate and thorough. Additionally, I have been unable to find any source outside of my own listing indicating that this jack has audio input capability. I am very sorry that it is not working, but I listed the item in an accurate condition and I am told by samsung it is functioning as it would in perfect, new condition. 

&gt;That having been said, I am willing to give you a partial refund to make decrease your payment to be equal with the 2nd highest bidder on the item: $261, $5 rebate. I do not think I have done anything wrong in representing this item's condition, and I think that this dispute stems from an assumption on your part. If you have any information suggesting otherwise, please let me know so I can reconsider.""

I think i am being more than generous. Does anyone think I am being less than fair?

Anyone been through something similar before than can help offer some wisdom here?

Ebay,Need some advice on a returned item that came back damaged.,"I sold a smartphone about 2 weeks ago that I had previously purchased for a cheap price on eBay. The original seller told me the esn was clean and the phone was good to be activated. So I figured alright cool and flipped the phone for some more money and was satisfied with my deal I had made. Then I get an email from my buyer telling me that Verizon wouldn't allow him to activate the phone since the previous user never disconnected it or has outstanding balances on their account (assuming it the latter). Anyway, I apologize to my buyer and tell him to send it back and ill give him a refund as soon as I make sure the phone he sends matches the serial number to the one I orginally had sent out. I get the phone in the mail today, and the screen is totally effed up. I sent him an email and asked how the screen got busted and he claims that it arrived to him like that and that I had packaged the phone poorly. I packaged the phone fine, and said something along the lines of that I figured he would have mentioned that to me if it had arrived like that. He hasn't responded to me yet. I guess mg question is, what do I do here? Did this dude just break my phone and send it back, or if it was the post office's doing, then what? I think I purchased $100 worth of insurance for it, can I still claim that since my buyer said it showed up like that to his house even though I don't believe him? Any advice is appreciated.

Ebay,For those who do ebay full-time or heavy part-time...

I find myself using only the built-in ebay tools to list (and ship) as I am not high volume (although I recently upgraded to a store account). But I can see that said tools would be very counter intuitive if I were to increase volume by even a moderate amount. 

What sort of set up do you have? Do you have a warehouse, storage, employees, helpers, etc...? Do you use ebay's tools for listing, shipping, etc? Or do you use something like Auctiva?

Ebay,"I sold a fully functional iPhone 4 with a smashed back, a month ago to a buyer. He is now filing an “item not as described” dispute with me because it “stopped working” a day or two ago. He wants me to refund him $100 even though it was working when I sent it. How do I handle this?","I have been selling on eBay for 6 years and opened a new account to sell some of our used iPhones for my employer, because we changed providers. I sold 15 iPhones but had multiple issues with buyers trying to scam me by saying that the phone is broken when they received it, or that they already sent me the money and to just ship them the phone. I’m thinking this might be one of those cases. 
When I listed the phone, I stated that the back screen was smashed, but the phone is fully functional, item is sold as is, without warranty. I know the phone was working because I was using it for 3 weeks as a music player in a dock. 
This buyer purchased it for 275.00 a month ago, and now is saying it stopped working a day or two ago. He said he took it to Apple to have them look at it and they are going to charge him 160 to fix it. He wants me to reimburse him 100 and he’ll “eat” the rest. Or he wants to return it.
 I don’t know what he did to the phone during the month that he had it. I don’t want to pay for a repair that he probably caused, (or he wants me to give him 100 bucks so he can get the screen replace on my dime) and I don’t want him to return me a phone that he broke.

Ebay,Need help. Got scammed by an eBayer,"On Aug 05 2012, I paid for an earphone on eBay Germany. It cost me 146 Euros and I paid via Paypal

It arrived a month later. Upon opening the package, I realized the seller sent me a different model earphone from the one I bought. This was an older and cheaper model.

I contacted the seller, but he did not respond. So I opened a dispute on eBay and it was only then that he replied. He offered me a partial refund of 25 Euros, giving some lame excuse that some other buyer didn't want to return the model which I bought (no idea what he meant there). It was clear to me that he had knowingly sent me wrong earphones, in hope that I would just brush it off and accept 25 Euros as compensation.

Anyway, I replied, saying that I wanted a full refund. Immediately after sending the message, the status of my dispute claim became 'case resolved', even though I never accepted the seller's offer. It was really weird. My guess was that because I was operating on the eBay site with German as the language, I might have clicked on something unknowingly that closed the case. (although Im sure I didnt)

I called Paypal. Customer service said that I have to go through eBay. I emailed eBay Cust Service, but they told me that they cannot re-open a closed dispute. What do I do now? I have been sending emails to the seller but he doesnt respond (obviously trying to avoid the situation). I am still covered by the 45 days buyer protection by Paypal, but not for long. Is there anything that I can do? Paypal and eBay cant help. Do I call my bank?

Why keep going to ebay if you're not satisfied with either the service or the result? And you have to pay for that? FOR NOTHING?

I just don't get it, shouldn't marketplaces be free? I mean, it's 2012, the internet is growing faster and faster, we're social with people from all over the world. Why not combine the social part with the e-commerce? It's easier to identify your buyer/seller once you put a face on them.

Ebay,The buyer mailed me the wrong item. What do I do?,"I purchased an iPod Touch a few days ago from a buyer and received the package today, pretty quickly. Unfortunately, inside the package was a bunch of non-related items with a packing slip addressed to a person across the country. I'm guessing the buyer accidentally mixed up the packages and shipping labels. What should I do? I just sent a message notifying them of what I've received. I told them if they can contact the other person and get the iPod back that I'll still be happy to receive it and won't mind the delay, but that if that isn't possible then I'll have to ask for a full refund. I also offered to ship these items back to the seller (as the packing slip indicates they sold it for $50, so I know it must suck to have made such a costly mistake). But I'm not sure if the other person will agree to mail back an iPod Touch upon opening the package, unfortunately.

Do you guys think it will be okay to ship these items back to the seller and wait a few weeks to see if they can get the iPod back to me, and if not then open a case? I know mistakes happen so I want to give the guy a chance to make it right, but I don't want to end up on the short end of the stick either, haha. I know eBay favors the buyer in disputes though.

Ebay,"Well, I've gotten myself into something pretty sticky, could use a little bit of advice...","Ok, so here's the story so far: 

I sold an iPad to a buyer with buy it now. I went to click on ""View PayPal transaction"" and got an error saying the transaction ID in the link was invalid. After a bit of digging, I found out that my eBay account was still linked to my parents PayPal, which I guess is some big secret and I'm not allowed to log on to it. So I linked my eBay account with my own PayPal account, so this won't happen again in the future.

I told the buyer about the situation and they said they cancelled the payment in PayPal and got refunded. They also said eBay told them to send me their email address so I can send them an invoice manually. Now here's my question: How? 

Earlier I sent an invoice because that's what the option had changed to beside the item in my ""Sold"" list. Now the option to send an invoice isn't there and the default action is to ""View PayPal transaction."" Do I just have to wait for it to go through or should I be doing something?

Ebay,I need some advice on what to do in this situation,"So a few weeks ago (about the middle of August) I sold Battlefield 3 for the Xbox 360 to someone that won it in an auction. Now, I always wait until the people buy the item before shipping it, so I waited about a week or two for this guy to send in the payment. I got no alerts or messages that he paid for the item, so I sent him a message saying that if he doesn't pay then I'm gonna put it back up for second chance. He said he would ""send in the payment tomorrow"". 

Well, I got that message August 27th, it is now September 15th and I still received no answer from this guy, and no payment. 

What should I do? Am I allowed to put the item back up for auction? Or am I stuck having to sell it to this guy? I am already suspicious of him because he said he would send in the payment but he hasn't, which makes me feel like he is trying to trick me or something.

Ebay,1st time doing an eBay refund. (Please advise me on how to protect myself),"Hi /r/ebay

I recently bought a smartphone handset only to find out when it arrived it did not respond to touch, making the phone unusable.

I contacted the seller about this and they have offered me a refund. (They didn't ask any questions and offered me a refund straight out which made me a little bit suspicious) 

Heres exactly what they said

*Glad to hear the phone arrived, but sorry to hear it isn't performing as expected.

When I was preparing the listing I did notice that the touch screen was not as responsive as my current phone, but didn't consider that this might indicate a fault. I never had an issue with it in the past, but I upgraded last year and the phone had been boxed up since, so I didn't have any recent experience with it to compare.

While I did specify no returns accepted in the listing, I did describe the phone as in full working order. If you don't feel that's the case and the phone is significantly different as described, then we can look at a return and refund.

Let me know what you want to do.*

**I want some advice about how I go about making sure that when I return the phone they don't keep it and not give me my money**

I've never been through this process before and would appreciate any support or advice anyone can give me.

EDIT: I found this:
How to return an item if the seller doesn’t use our return process

&gt; If the seller hasn’t opted in to use our return process, you can’t request a return in our resolution Centre. Instead, you may contact the seller directly by clicking “Ask a question” on the view item page or in My eBay and agree about the return process with the seller directly.

&gt; For most Buy It Now items, business sellers are legally required to accept your return (more commonly known as “cancellation or withdrawal” under the law), if you contact them to cancel your purchase within 7 working days after the date of receipt.

&gt; Where the seller accepts the cancellation they will then cancel the transaction at our Resolution Centre. You will be notified by an email and just need to click the button in the email to accept the cancellation.

Ebay,I am going to loose my shit with ebay!!!,"I have been trying to sell my laptop for over a month now:

I have listed it 4 times now and people keep bidding, winning, and not paying...

1) buyer begs me to sell it to him at a discounted prices seeing as he is a student and can only afford $520, i ignore the offer and let the auction play out. bid ends up only going to $520 with him winning, and within an hour i get a message saying something like ""due to circumstances beyond my control i can no longer purchase this item. offer second chance to another guy, no luck

2) relist and I get a guy that wins, doesn't pay, no contact nothing.

3) relist again, no bids no winner

4a) relist, get a guy that wins, guy claims that i have misleading information on my listing about the specs, i ask him what they are and why he would bid on it if he knew something was misleading, no response.

4b) offer second chance to a guy, he kindly accepts the offer and asks how much it will be to ship to canada, i say $10 more, he says it wont let him pay and to send an invoice, i send invoice multiple times as well as send him emails to see if he got them, no answer to anything in the past 3 days.

I've done everything i can think of to ensure i'm an honest upstanding ebayer, i've sent invoices, immediate responses, and everything i can think of. am i doing something wrong? also how do i leave negative feedback for these people, i've sent claims to ebay and so far ive had one transaction canceled but this is getting out of hand and i want these people off of ebay if they are going to be wasting everyones time.

Ebay,"Computer I shipped arrived damaged. As a seller, do I have any protection against fraud?","A few days ago, I shipped a computer off to a buyer. I packed it well, but apparently it was damaged in transit.

The buyer sent me a message telling me this, and asked me how to proceed because he knows that I got insurance on the package through UPS.

However, I recently found out that UPS guidelines for shipping materials/techniques are supposedly very strict, and I'm guessing that they would deny a claim even though it was packed quite well.

So far, the buyer has not initiated a dispute or anything like that (to my knowledge), and I've asked him to send me pictures of the damage. I also asked if the computer still works. He replied saying that he'd send pics in the morning, but I guess he couldn't test it because he also said ""no power cord was included"" -- correct, I didn't include a power cord.. Just the pc and a couple other things which were explictly listed.

So, what are the possible outcomes here? How do I know that the buyer didn't accidentally drop the computer as he was carrying it down his stairs and is now trying to get his money back? For all I know, that's what happened.

What is the worst case scenario? What about the best case? I have no experience in these matters -- I've only sold about 20 some things on eBay and I've always had a positive experience. What should I do?",11,3,2012-09-26,EBAY,0.04150617495179176,0.8765853643417358,0.08190849423408508

Ebay,Not sure if this could be a scam or what?,"I sold an item on ebay for a little less than $300 w/ shipping. I shipped it to the winner earlier this week via Fedex Ground/Home Delivery with adult signature required. Fedex contacted me yesterday stating that they couldn't find the receiver. The address was confirmed on PayPal, and when I google it, it comes up. Thing is, it has an apartment number, but on google maps they look like houses, or townhouses at least. But more googling showed there were apartment numbers at this address (for example, winner is in apartment 3A and I can see from rental sites online there are 3B and 3F, etc.).

I'm kind of getting freaked out though. The buyer never gave me a phone number so I couldn't list it on the package. I've had to email the buyer the phone number for the local Fedex people by him who keep calling me so he can sort it out because I can't do anything. The tracking said ""incorrect address - recipient moved"" and then again said ""cannot locate recipient."" Fedex woman on the phone told me he moved??? What's worse is after emailing the buyer about this yesterday and again a few times today, he's still not responded at all.

Fedex said they'd ship it back to me after holding it for 10 days. I'm wondering if this is some sort of scam. Like later he's going to try to re-route it to another address and then try to get his money back? But I took a lot of precautions... I took pictures of the packaging process, the finished package, have delivery confirmation already and adult signature required, and have the receipt AND a voicemail on my phone from the woman at Fedex.... I'm hoping that's enough to not lose my handmade item AND money.

The guy who bought it has only one good feedback as a buyer, and that was in 2009, and given on the same day that he made the account. Looks like he hasn't used it since.
