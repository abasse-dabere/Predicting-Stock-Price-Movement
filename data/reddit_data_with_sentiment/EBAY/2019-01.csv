Ebay,"Buyer wants to return MacBook Pro, VERY apprehensive","Hey all!

So I'm in need of some advice! I recently sold my MacBook Pro on eBay for around Â£280, in full working order, boxed, with chargers, all great. It has been working for me absolutely fine since 2011 when I bought it, however 2 days after posting it I immediately got a return request saying that it wouldn't turn on.

*""its not turning on.  so disappointed.""*

Immediately I felt like this was a red flag and something was up, so instead of accepting the return I opted to send a message, and photographs of the MacBook working perfectly fine a few days before I sent it. I even gave instructions on how to perform an SMC reset, as the only thing I could think of was that the battery died mid-transit, but no reason why it wouldn't have charged on arrival. I was hit with this.

*"" please excerpt return and have a look on its return.  i do not want to make mess with any thing.  all i know you disappoint me. ""*

Seemingly rushing me into accepting the return, I wasn't happy with this. I explained how it had been working perfectly fine for all these years and yet one day with this guy and it's supposedly broken. I explained my fears that they had either broken the laptop legitimately or I would be shipped back an identical yet defective unit.

*"" i have picked up from post office,this morning,because they have left  card.  i did try with charge again,in case if the battery need to be  recharge,its  turn on with charger now,but its not going in to software  for more then 20 minutes,this is not what i have paid for.  there for i  am not happy with your item,also not happy with your very bad service.*

His story changed and he is now saying that the item does boot up. He only gave it half an hour between picking the item up from the Post Office to deciding it was broken and sending the return request, he didn't give it any time to charge whatsoever and his first instinct was to not asking me any questions about the item and to instead demand money back immediately.

I'm extremely apprehensive about this as it was an expensive purchase, it cost me a lot to ship and covering the shipping back to me will be a large drain, and just something rubs me the wrong way about the way he types, his demeanour and his attitude towards all of this. My feedback score is 100%, people note in the comments how trustworthy I am. His feedback score is also 100% and full of genuine comments but here's the thing.

The username they use on eBay is (similar as I don't want to give the EXACT name) computerdenLTD and all they sell are refurbished laptops. This also makes me think I'm going to receive something different back, but also confuses me as if they are a refurbishing company I struggle to see why they've proclaimed my item as DOA when they most likely have whatever they need to fix the faults, not that I believe there are any (and if there were I would be happy to give a PARTIAL refund at the very least).

I know eBay and PayPal favour the buyers but is there anything you can think I could do?

Thanks!

EDIT: From comments asking me to keep him talking I messaged him back and asked if he could try a different MacBook charger in his possession (as a laptop refurbisher) to see if we can find where the so called problem lies, was very nice and courteous and I received this:

*"" i think it is ti late to be nice,as i do not have confidence on your  service any more,your macbook is packed and ready to be post,you will  except the faulty macbook return sooner or later.you can check on its  return your self,i do not believe you sale stuff on ebay ,like this,even  the screws at the back of macbook not properly been  fixed,  i have  contacted the ebay,yesterday,and been given advise,i believe my money is  protected.

Ebay,2 Packages showing up as as delivered in box today but not in box...,"I've never, ever had this happen before (that I know of). I ordered 2 items on Ebay (2 different sellers) and they came with tracking. On each item it says that they were delivered to my mailbox today at 2:45. Neither were in my box. It wasn't mail theft because I have one of those boxes where you need a key to get the mail (also I got the mail around that time). 

I went to the USPS website to report missing mail and I kept getting the same error message saying:
Error: 400 - Invalid Search Form - This search falls outside the acceptable time limit to file a missing-mail search.

I already figure I'm going to have to go in person to the post office first thing Tuesday morning. I'm assuming most likely that the carrier delivered both packages to a different household. If the person who gets it doesn't do anything to assist, what do I do? Obviously it's not the seller's problem so I wouldn't involve them. But I could just see that if I contact Paypal that they say it's between me and USPS.

Ebay,USPS Priority Mail vs USPS Priority Mail Large Flat Rate Box,"So I am trying to sell an item that is about 5 pounds and it fits inside of the USPS Priority Mail Large Flat Rate Box. When selling this on ebay, under the shipping service, do I select USPS Priority Mail or do I select USPS Priority Mail Large Flat Rate Box?

Ebay,Seller wants me to use their return shipping label instead of eBay's. Which should I do?,"Hello all, I rarely use eBay so I'm not exactly sure what is sketchy and what isn't. I got the wrong item (roll of colored pencils instead of a screen protector) and I contacted them to see what was up. The item was in an Amazon bag so I wonder if the seller just forwarded the wrong thing through Amazon. No response so I started the eBay return process and got a label.

Ebay,An obvious scammer bought my items. Looking for advice.,"So last night, I listed 5x items which sell for like $100 each. I listed BIN for $120 each. I figured I'd slowly lower the price until they sell. Well, I wake up this morning and someone bought 3 of them. 

The buyer has an address that has ""STE"" in the second line -- which means 'suite', which usually means a mail forwarding address. So I google the address and the first result is from Bad Buyers' List. The buyers name and address appears with about 10 complaints, **most saying the buyer buys multiple items and claims only one arrives**. Of course, they link different eBay accounts, but all are reporting the same name/address as guy who bought my 3 items. (The most recent complaint about this buyer was posted ""19 hours ago""; the earliest is about a year).  

Some others complain about the feedback they leave, so I look at the feedback the buyer leaves for his sellers. It looks like this: 

https://i.imgur.com/0TPrJAV.png

So, what do I do? If I ship the item, I'll get scammed (and probably negative feedback). If I cancel the sale, I'll get negative feedback... is there any other option? Could I ship all 3 separately with 3 tracking numbers? That seems risky, dealing with a scammer... 

I don't sell too much, so I'm hoping someone can advise me how to proceed. Any way to cancel this order without getting negative feedback / docked on my account? 

tl;dr an obvious scammer bought 3 of my items. It's likely they will claim I only sent one of them. Wondering the best way to proceed without losing money or getting negative feedback.",14,4,2019-01-01,EBAY,0.22063125669956207,0.7535590529441833,0.02580971084535122

Ebay,Global Shipping Program: sending gifts internationally?,"Hello! My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship, she's from the USA and I'm in Portugal. Over here you have to pay stupidly high taxes for anything bought online (personal gift or not) over â¬22, INCLUDING shipping, if it comes from outside of Europe. Which means â¬12 just for the customs handling your shit, and more or less half of the price of the overall value of your package, so for example, she recently sent me all used Nintendo DS and headphones among other stuff worth $200 and I had to wait a month and pay $91 just to ""release"" it to me - she used USPS and listed as a gift, everything correctly and visibly, so despite the process of being picked for customs here being supposedly random, it was likely worsened because of the quantity of things of various categories on the inside (violin strings, pencils, a book, origami, etc), as told by the customs officer.

&amp;#x200B;

So, when it comes to her sending me gifts like her clothes, letters, chocolates, overall not exactly high monetary value goods but many different categories of sentimental stuff, they would get stuck in my country's shitty customs regardless, since the cheapest shipping price alone is $34 for her. Then I learned about eBay's Global Shipping Program that everyone praises and was suggested to me in the way of 1) wife puts her ""package"" for sale and 2) I ""buy"" her package and then don't have to pay as much as I would with our customs since eBay takes care of that, avoiding the horrible bureaucracy and waiting as well. My two questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1- Would GSP actually cover all the fees from the beginning (paid by the seller if I got it right) and possibly charge me less than Portuguese customs?

&amp;#x200B;

2- How should we handle her sending a box full of different products, like chocolates, clothes, plushies, sometimes used console games, jewellery (not necessarily expensive ones) and how ""risky"" is it? We're concerned eBay would find it odd and not let it through or overcharge.

Ebay,"Received item a day after being issued a refund, how to legally resolve?","I had a package that was 2 weeks over the expected delivery and the tracking number wasn't showing any signs of movement.
A second tracking number showed up on the item in Ebay showing failed delivery to some random address outside my state.
Because of this I opened a case with Ebay, asked the seller if he knew what was going on and told him I was fine with waiting a few more days if it was on the way (I didn't ask for a refund).
The seller said the second number was somebody else's and he'd look into the issue.
An hour later I got an email from Paypal saying he'd issued me a full refund.

Today I finally got the package and the original tracking number now shows delivered.
Now i'm not sure what the best way to handle the situation is. As far as I know there's nothing else I can do through Ebay directly now that he's issued me a refund.

From what I've read the only options are sending him the money again directly through Paypal or writing ""return to sender"" on the package and sending it back since I haven't opened it yet.
Ideally i'd prefer to pay him and keep the package but I'm scared of getting into deals outside of Ebay and I don't have any experience sending money directly through Paypal.
I haven't actually gotten the refund in my bank account yet though Paypal says it's been issued.

If I repay him through Paypal by sending the money directly will this legally be considered payment? Is there any way he can dispute the refund or say that I kept the package without paying him since on Ebay it shows ""refunded"". Is there otherwise any way I could get screwed or scammed by sending the money directly, or is this dangerous in any way?

Is it safer to just have it returned to sender and again is there any way he can later dispute the refund since the tracking info on his side now verifies that I received it?

Is there a way of handling it through Ebay or are they totally out of the picture at this point?

Sorry if some of this seems obvious, as I said i'm really not familiar with how Paypal works since I only use it to buy on Ebay.",6,3,2019-01-01,EBAY,0.034392014145851135,0.9214640855789185,0.044143904000520706
Ebay,eBay iPhone scam,"Hello, my father recently sold my mothers old iPhone 6plus. The guy bought it for 400-500$ everything was fine until a few weeks after the guy got the phone.

A few more days go by and eBay takes the money my dad got for the phone out of his account that was linked to his bank account.

Thanks everyone for your help!

Ebay,How to mark âitem as receivedâ as a buyer?,"Iâve bought an item from a new seller, 20 feedback, and this dude really wants his money. Heâs sent it as Royal Mail Special Delivery on 02 Jan, which guarantees next day delivery on 03 Jan, which I did receive today.

Seems like a really nice dude. He said PayPal wonât release his funds by 09 Jan, I donât know how true that is, maybe because heâs a new seller?

Ebay,Possible a new Fraud / Scam.,"So I order through the internet all the time and I just discovered that that with a new ""FedEx"" shipping system after a seller providers the user with their ""Tracking Number"" as long as it's through ""FedEx"" a user or any user with the tracking number for that matter can change the ""Delivery Address"" thus the item does not make it to the buyer, and the seller is responsible based off the buyers claims.

Though I am not sure how ""Ebay"" would see this even if the seller can prove the sent it to the right address, then it would still be Liability for the carrier in this case ""FedEx"" to provide refund / replacement given anyone with the tracking number can re-route a package.

Though it seems to prompt a user to login after entering the info and pay a fee, as we know ""Cellphones"" ""Laptops"" can use public WI-FI, and Giftcards or prepaid visa's can be used to re-route an item that costs thousands of dollars then the buyer claims they didn't receieve the item or whatever.

**Obviously Fraud can be tracked, though a person who knows their technology, and ways to stay anonymous could in theory do this easily and not get caught as long as it's not done too much.**

**Would like thought's on this, though i'd personally think if you're an Ebay seller stay away from FedEX until this is fixed.**

Ebay,Unjust Sellers Fees on Unsold Item - What happens if I don't pay?,"So a few weeks ago I had a laptop listed for sale on Ebay. A buyer messaged me and tried to strike a deal outside of the Ebay ecosystem so he could get a better price and I wouldn't have to pay fees. I know this is against Ebay's Policy. I responded to this message by saying that I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN SETTLING OUTSIDE OF EBAY and explicitly told him that this was against ebays policy. I then immediately contacted Ebay customer support by phone and told them what happend so I could try to get ahead of it. The women I spoke with was polite and told me I didn't have anything to worry about and ""noted my account"". Ultimately the laptop didn't sell through and I decided to keep it for a while until the holiday sale prices lifted and it became more valuable.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course today I noticed that I'm being charged a Final Value fee on the laptop with a notice saying that I ""settled outside of ebay"" after they reviewed my messages. I am infuriated. This laptop didn't sell, and I tried to do the right thing during this whole interaction. I again contacted Ebay customer service and instead of a polite women I got a pretty rude man. He told me that since I can't ""prove"" that I didn't sell the laptop that I have to pay their fees. I asked what proof he wanted? I told him I could provide a picture of the laptop with a date written? He told me that he'd ""escalate the case"" but it's likely that there's nothing they can do! Are you kidding me?

I honestly rarely use Ebay and I've been pretty annoyed by the cost of their service for a while now. I plan to entirely discontinue the use of their service in the future.

Ebay,"Please help, eBay is refunding buyers!","Okay, so this is what basically has happened so far.

&amp;#x200B;

So last night i went to a friends house, and i took my old laptop with me that i haven't used in a long time. So I used it to login to my eBay account and manage a couple sales. However, i shortly after noticed that i had a VPN installed on it, and that it automatically connected to a foreign IP-address on startup.

&amp;#x200B;

I turned it off, and didn't think much of it. Today i woke up to several e-mails from eBay saying that my account has been compromised. The outcome was that they completely wiped all my sales along with my sellers feedback. If that's not enough, they have a system that automatically begins refunding most/all buyers that purchased items from you. One would think this stupid system would at most refund any purchases made in the last 24 hours. But no, it's completely random. It's refunding my very recent sales, and my very first ones a couple weeks back. Mind you, these buyers have received their items, were satisfied, and left me positive feedback. Now they are getting refunds for their purchases out of nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately called eBay to let them know that my account is NOT compromised, and that my PC simply had a VPN running in the background which connected automatically on startup, all of which i was unaware of.

&amp;#x200B;

After alot of holds, they informed me they would reinstate my account back to how it was. Great!

&amp;#x200B;

So i asked them what about my buyers that are suddenly being refunded due to your automatic system. They told me there is nothing they could do about it since it's an automatic system that automatically triggers refunds to buyers when it believes an account has been compromised.

&amp;#x200B;

What i was told instead was: ""the only advice i can give you, is to contact those buyers and ask them to send back the payments to you"" Are you kidding me? How is this a reasonable solution? What guarantees that those buyers will actually care to send me back their payments? They essentially got those items for free now, so what incentive do they have to send the payment back?

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Small edit here\*\*:** *As i was adviced from the eBay agents, i contacted several buyers to ask for the payment to be returned to me. The buyer with the largest purchase so far ($160) suddenly replied to me saying he was not satisfied with the item. Even though he sent me a message after the item was delivered a couple weeks ago, that he was really satisfied with the purchase, and left a positive feedback with it. Well, what do you know huh? Obviously i knew this was going to happen, that an X amount of buyers will now have an excellent opportunity to come up with a bullshit story for them to keep their now free item, as they have no obligation by eBay to return the payment.*

&amp;#x200B;

So im told no one can do a manual override of this stupid automated system to stop refunding my buyers, even after i've confirmed to the eBay agents several times that it was indeed me signed in to my own account, except while mistakenly connected with a VPN. What a medieval security system this is.

&amp;#x200B;

How about sending me an e-mail or a text, and informing me that they've noticed a login on my account from an unusual location, and have me confirm if it was me or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Now they've put me in a huge mess, forcing me to track down all buyers that got refunded, and ask them to return my payment, while looking like an idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Accidently logged in to my eBay account while connected with a VPN which i was not aware of, and now eBay is stealing my money.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, do anyone have any suggestions on how i move forward with this? Can i call PayPal and open a dispute on all the refunds that is being made?",31,29,2019-01-05,EBAY,0.07824701070785522,0.888540506362915,0.033212512731552124
Ebay,Fickle buyer wants to return item - how should I approach this?,"I came by a pretty rare color on an expensive pair of Chloe Susanna boots.

""So gorgeous but I just canât make myself fall in love with the color.

I have a no return policy in my listing (although I will issue refund if the item is broken/or not as described). I am very hesitant to take this return back because she admitted to trying on the shoes at home. These shoes were sent new in box and I feel like I'll get the shoes in less than pristine condition. The other part of me is saying take the shoes back and block this buyer and try to get it listed again for a quick sale. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kicking myself because I had gained a healthy amount of watchers and I knew from the questions this particular buyer was asking that she was going to be very picky (she didn't believe me when I provided a copy of the receipt for provenance - I blacked everything important out, she went head and had the shoes authenticated by a 3rd party which she paid).

Ebay,"Seller didnt send any items over Christmas, now has over 30 negative feedback this month.

I checked the sellers feedback and it was around 160, 100% positive. I figured it's the holidays, so reached out to the seller on the 24th to ask of it had been shipped as I'd heard nothing.

On the 31st I'd had no reply and still no notification of shipping so I reported the item as undelivered and eBay started their 8 day count down. I've checked the sellers again and they've received loads of negative feedback for non delivery, with some items being more expensive than others. Of course I'm only out of pocket Â£5, so I'm ok to wait on eBay ruling in my favor.

Ebay,Update to previous post. Bizarre messages and behavior from buyer.,"So I posted not long ago about a strange transaction. [Here is the link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/abt6n0/received_offer_for_double_the_listed_price_of_the/?st=JQLGYOHE&amp;sh=8ba3d52b)

Just to summarize, I listed three Silent Hill comics for $22.22 buy it now, no auction, and accepting offers. Someone offered me $44.44 and I accepted because I wasnât paying attention to which item sold. They sent me this strange message.

*âHi 843.*

*Just wanted to say thanks for listing this. Finding this was fate. For us Silent Hill is never over. This may help with the puzzle I am locked in. I just saw the cover of Among The Damned; and I knew this a break in the odds of forced fates.*

*Sincerely in thanks.*

*\~$YPHERâ*

I sent a follow up message to confirm that they realized that they offered me double the price I was asking, and they simply confirmed. I said if they are certain about the purchase Iâll ship, but I asked why they wanted to spend double the price I asked? I got no answer for a few days, I just shipped the item. So I got another message from the same buyer today, and itâs more bizarre than the last:

*âHey man. Sure. I don't mind you asking. I work with 'Silent Hill' footage from time to time; and I saw these and they looked rare; so I thought I'd offer you double. I don't really have any money but I thought these would be valuable. Things are not good here in the UK after the governments god damn 'BREXIT' to refuse the United Kingdom's part in the EU Commons; and sometimes bro, I feel like I'm living at Silent Hill. The past ten years since I was 18 years old has been a haunted nightmare; of revelation after revelation; and ghosts and demons start stepping to me like they know me, when no they don't and I died ten years ago. Sometimes I take a drive and come across memory lanes; this life is so haunted; I think I am from Wisconsin in the USA; but there's always someone popping there face through my flames and acting like they own me and I owe them something; changing my name and holding me to oppressive injustice.*

*In fact to be honest bro, I saw prysmhead last night walking on the roof and then the metal spiral staircase started to tilt forwards; and I thought, 'great, I'm going to drop and die', but I'm a big Command Soldier so I take it in my stride; but these perpetrators breaking through the existential material; of the continuum and into my mind; need to go away.*

*It's something to do with 'Umbrella', I uncovered a lost haunt of Umbrella Corporation known as The Ministry of Lost Souls; what seems like lifetimes ago yet only a few years on the calendar and I'm tired of the wind-up attacks; by enemy assailants. I'll never find my way back home.*

*Hope this fills the gap bro.â*

Itâs becoming clear to me that the person that bought this isnât well. Iâll offer to refund 50% of the sale price so they just pay my initial asking price. I feel bad for the guy. I work with people with psychosis and delusions every day at work, and it seems like this person needs help. Not a whole lot I can do, but I feel obligated to share this since itâs so bizarre.

\---

**EDIT:** Got another email:

*âThanks bro; that is really thoughtful of you.*

*It is kind of a dark place that I've been left in yet I guess it's a dark time in the world.*

*I'm doing okay; I guess I just never could've fathomed as a teenager, ten years ago; that all the myths I skipped through and aced in school would come back to haunt me.*

*I've been locked in the UK's mental health system for 8 years now and it's a total nightmare; so there's not really anyone to reach out to because one wrong word and they just take you away.*

*I am a theologian-anthropological writer, musician and film-maker; but it seems that the industry is so cut-throat and one-sided that nothing I do will ever break through.*

*Again, thanks for caring bro, appreciate that.â*

Check your listings/campaigns. eBay customer service is saying they had not heard of this issue but it is, so far, a 100% glitch across every account I've reached out to about campaigns that ended on December 31st.",5,10,2019-01-06,EBAY,0.0386410728096962,0.9317025542259216,0.0296564269810915

Ebay,New stance on sending to a new address?,"Hey all,

So this week, a buyer messaged me the old ""can you ship to this address instead?"" As always, I basically said I can cancel the sale and they can repurchase with the new address if they wish.

This time, however, I also got a message from eBay customer service (yes, it is actually from them, not some scam message made by the buyer) telling me the buyer contacted them and asking me to change the address.

Being this is the opposite of what eBay reps told me in the past, I called eBay THREE TIMES and talked to three different reps. All told me that if you have a message from the buyer asking to change the address, you are covered under ebay buyer protection if you have tracking showing delivered to the NEW zip code.

Now I still didn't ship to the new address, because none of the reps had anything to say about what might happen if the buyer opened a case with PayPal. I found it really crappy of eBay to encourage me to send it to a random address the buyer messaged me, knowing full well that if the address isn't PayPal confirmed, I could be screwed. It seems like eBay has changed their position on this, unless I happened to get three reps that all had the same answer.",15,3,2019-01-06,EBAY,0.08020929992198944,0.892650306224823,0.02714044786989689
Ebay,eBay trying to force us to communicate with a buyer.,"We have been on eBay for 3 or 4 years at this point, but we have recently seen a new behavior that has been problematic. When we run a sale we always have the occasional customer who says ""can I have it for 20% off the sales price"" and we respond with ""Sorry, we cannot do that and do not accept offers.. etc etc"". Sometimes we get a customer who refuses to take no as an answer and they continue to send offers so we ignore those emails because we are not going to waste our time with customers like that. The issue we are running into now is that we have had a couple of customers call eBay and state we are not responding to them. Instead of reviewing the message history eBay seems to be siding with them and sending us a message saying that the buyer is waiting for a response and we need to communicate with them to resolve the issue. They have not bought anything from us and we have made our stance clear. We don't accept offers for a reason and eBay should not try and force us into communicating with them after we have given them a firm answer. I responded to one of the service requests asking eBay what the policy is for this situation. I also stated we have already replied to this customer and that we do not accept best offer. I will let everyone know what eBay says if they respond. In the interim we decided to block the users in question to prevent any further issues.

Ebay,"Ebays ""Smart offer"" is trash so spam their tech support making them fix it","Ebay in their infinite wisdom has a fun new program called ""Smart offer"" whereby it decides arbitrarily that your auctions are too expensive despite them being the lowest in the market and repeatedly enables the ""make an offer"" feature. Interestingly enough, this feature only is enabled on my best selling items, and scaling at that. my best selling item which has sold dozens of units sold in less then 30 days receives a new ""make an offer""update every 6 hours or so, but my auctions that either haven't sold, or sold a single unit do not have any ""make an offer"" enabled. 

This feature is ridiculous in its premise, ridiculous in its execution and ridiculous from a pr standpoint. The initial offer minimum is 1/2 the price of the buy it now, yet there are very very few markets on eBay that have anything resembling a 100% profit margin i would imagine, when you take the fees into consideration its absolutely ludicrous. eBay support staff's suggestion? Enable this asinine feature but set the auto-decline to anything less then 1 penny under the buy it now.

What a great idea, lets piss off every single customer by making it auto decline every offer after the system says ""hey this person is open to offers."" there is no outcome where this moronic system is a benefit rather then a PR nightmare for any seller on eBay. 

But, like all benevolent corporations, they clearly know better then everybody and all I get told is how great this is, and how this will increase sales on my best selling items by trying to force me to sell my product below cost... for... reasons, AND SCIENCE!  So the only way to correct moronic behavior like this is to annoy them into compliance. 

&amp;#x200B;

IF you have this issue, join me in calling eBay every single time they enable this garbage on one of your auctions and make their staff go through every single auction you have removing the ""make best offer"" feature. Eventually if it annoys them enough they will do away with this garbage and those who have the margins to accept offers can do so when setting up their auctions, and those who don't want the feature can continue to not select it when setting their auction.",35,49,2019-01-07,EBAY,0.04246323183178902,0.9221670627593994,0.03536975011229515
Ebay,How can I stop losing money on calculated shipping?,"New to this sub, apologies if this is a clichÃ© topic.

I've been selling household items on eBay for years, and even though I now pre-pack my items, weigh them, and measure the package at home when I post the item, I still consistently come up short on shipping costs using eBay's Calculated Shipping (based on buyer's location) with UPS.

It seems like eBay's algorithm just isn't in sync with what UPS actually charges. My measurements and weights are accurate (I round up on inches and pounds), but when the auction closes and I go to ""Print a Label"" (I always do home-printed labels now to avoid mark-ups as UPS franchised shipping centers), it always costs at least $3-$7+ more for shipping than what eBay calculated and charges the buyer.

And since eBay automatically prompts for a payment and many buyers send payment immediately, it feels like bad form to go back to the buyer to ask for a few bucks more to cover 100% of the shippingâit's not their fault eBay gets it wrong.

Before I did my own packing and weighing/measuring, I had a few items that were so badly off that I actually lost money on the item.

I know UPS relatively recently changed the way they charge for shipping costs (now heavily based on the physical size of the package), but I would imagine eBay's partnership with them would have kept pace with that change.

In the last few sales I've done, I've ended up including a $4-$5 ""Handling Cost"" to help offset the inevitable difference, so I'll see how that works out.

Any other advice for actually getting accurate Calculated Shipping from eBay that will carry over to UPS's Print a Label system?

Thanks!

Ebay,Help on how to resolve buyer scam,"1. Buyer bought a 2014 Mac Mini for $425 which included shipping.
2. The buyer payed via PayPal.
3. I shipped the item via USPS with insurance and signature delivery.
4. The delivery signature matches the first initial last name of the buyer.

This is where the scam starts:

1. The buyer opens an item not as described. They claimed it was not the Mac Mini that was listed.
2. I did not feel I had any recourse as I listed the item details based from the serial number search that Apple said. I also know the details since I had the bill of sale.
3. The buyer ships the item back and in the box is a series of stainless steal(a little bit of humor) plates.

This where I feel I might be out of luck. The return shipping weight is the exact same as my delivery weight. The buyer was very slick as the box was even padded so the plates did not shake around and the weight is exact.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have any recourse in this other than reporting the serial number of the Mac stolen so they can never take it to the store for repair?

Ebay,Seller metric ding - mistake?,"So I did a quick search and it seems like there is a lot to digest. While I kinda have an idea already, wondering if anyone had any similar experience  


. I have a virtually flawless metric score, top rated and powerseller status.  


I had up for sale a listing for an air vent for a Mercedes. The listing was 110% accurate. Good pictures. The color is ""dark gray"". I put dark gray. I know sometimes manufactures have slight variations in color options from year to year. Potential buyer asks if he thinks it will match his car. I took more pictures, did some research, and I suspected it would, but made a deal with him that if it doesn't match, he can return it AT HIS EXPENSE.  


I was quite confident based on the back and forth that it actually was a match. Of course, he gets it and says it doesn't match and it's too dark. Okay whatever man. I instructed him to request a return through his purchase history. He did, I was on my phone and clicked accept return. When I went to my computer to look at the info, I saw he wrote ""Item not as described or doesn't match pictures"". I was livid. The system also made me pay for the label. So I instructed him to cancel. Once a request is canceled, it cannot be reopened. I figure ebay can help, so I called and got a lady who understood. I told her I just want my fees back and no ding. I'll gladly accept return. She said that the buyer can call and reopen the case, but it reopens the same case and the reason will still be the same and it will be on my metrics.   


Basically, I know my score is high enough that this most likely won't make a difference, but it still gets me angry. She said metrics cannot be undone. Anyone know if a canceled return request will show up on your metrics? It's too early to see anything posted as this just happened an hour ago.

Ebay,Buyer being a jerk with counter offers,"I got a lowball offer this morning for a heavy fax machine I had listed for a couple months. The buyerâs comment: âshipping is way too high.â (I ship from Hawaii.) While I am eager to get rid of it, I donât want to just give it away for free. So I responded politely and professionally and said âI feel bad about the shipping but thatâs just because Iâm located in Hawaii. Iâm still willing to give you $10 off to help offset this but thatâs the lowest I can go.â

My counter offer was still lower than the current trending price so I was sure he was going to accept. To my surprise, he counter offers with the exact same original lowball offer, no comments or anything. (As if him being pushy would make me reconsider my profit margins and rethink my entire business model....)

Iâm no idiot on eBay and this was immediately a red flag. I blocked buyer and declined offer right away.

My question: would you do what I did? Or continue to play the counter offer game with this guy and keep going back and forth?

My concern is this buyer would later claim a small defect or something and request a partial refund to get to his original lowball offer, so I immediately blocked and declined.",44,29,2019-01-10,EBAY,0.30375584959983826,0.6643338203430176,0.031910382211208344

Ebay,Mini-Rant - Buyers who leave negs,"I've been selling on eBay for 20 years. It has not been a walk in the park but there are indeed elements to the process that are enjoyable. 

I just added the 3 buyers who have left me negs over the past year to my blocked bidder list. In each case, as I revisited them, there was a loophole (as there are many when it comes to ""Seller Protection"" on eBay) which preclude the feedback removal. A loophole that allowed the buyer to leave inaccurate, emotional feedback. No matter how extreme the case may be, I will never again call eBay for feedback removal to hear ""Well, that's how the buyer felt."" 

Here's just one example of how ""Seller Protection"" is an urban myth. 

I mistakenly sent a similar item to someone. A sweater by the same designer as the sweater they ordered, same color, which turns out was already sold. The first email I received was FULL of abuse, swearing, etc. I apologized profusely and of course offered to pay for  return shipping, offered a discount on any item in my store, etc. Literally, this buyer asked me to pay him to drive to the post office to post the return shipment, along with continued swearing and accusations. 

I called eBay and reported him digitally multiple times. The emails were violent. Each time, of course, was told case would be reviewed, etc., etc. I was also told if he left a neg it would be removed. They agreed over and over this is not the kind of member eBay wants. 

He opened a return case via PayPal instead of eBay. I accepted the return and processed it immediately upon receipt, though I have to say I was a bit nervous opening the package, considering his communications. 

He then left a horrible neg, saying I was extorting him, sent the wrong item on purpose, etc. Seriously, who would send a wrong item on purpose? It's a SWEATER! Why would I go to that trouble? I called eBay and they said bc the case was opened via PayPal they would not remove the neg. I spent an hour on the phone with them. It was truly amazing to me that this documented, abusive buyer would be allowed to continue to not only buy, but sell on eBay. 

Anyway. It's hard not to take this personally as I know we all need to do. It's hurtful when you try your hardest. 

Just needed to vent.

Ebay,Ebay REALLY doesn't want you to leave a negative when a seller cancels a sale.,"I know everyone thinks buyers are so much protected by ebay, but as an HONEST buyer, I have seen ebay trend more and more toward penalty free cancellations for sellers.

A couple of years ago they removed the requirement for buyers to agree to cancellations, allowing sellers to cancel without the buyers consent. 

Then they even started refunding sellers their FVF's when they canceled. So no financial incentive for a seller to honor a sale if they are unhappy with winning bid.

Then they started hiding the ""leave feedback"" button when sellers canceled.

Then they started hiding the sellers reason for canceling, because so many sellers were lying and choosing ""buyer asked to cancel"".

Now they have taken it one step further and when a seller cancels they completely remove the item from your purchase history as if it never existed and you had never paid for it.

I have had so many sellers cancelling paid auctions lately, it is getting ridiculous. I know they get a ""defect"" for doing so, but unless there is a monetary penalty, it seems sellers are more than willing to cancel and get all their fees back if they don't like the final price of an auction. Really frustrating as a buyer. Now we have to jump through hoops to even leave a negative which is about the only power we have left as buyers. The only repercussion to hopefully make a seller honor an auction.

It seems ebay just wants to protect their image instead of legitimately encouraging honest feedback. And they seem to be encouraging penalty free cancellations more than ever.",30,7,2019-01-11,EBAY,0.12320083379745483,0.8438677787780762,0.03293132409453392

Ebay,New Seller With Some Questions,"Hello:

I recently started selling on eBay. I have been doing pretty well so far, but there are a lot of mistakes I'm probably making and things that I'm unsure about. Answers to any of the following questions would be greatly appreciated:

1. What is an effective method for pricing an item? I typically start at a price considerably lower than my competitors (who have far more feedback/history than I do), and if it hasn't sold in a couple days and I've accumulated watchers, I reduce the price by $5 or so. Am I being impatient here? Should I stand firm ?
2. Tying in with #1, is it possible that I could establish a reputation for always reducing my prices, and cause buyers to pick up on this trend? (Thus, causing them to wait until I lower the price)
3. A main competitor is selling the item I sell at $260. He/she has multiple sales daily, and hundreds overall. I sell it at $210-$220 (and also offering many more features), because I feel that if I priced it at $260 it would never sell. The ones I've set at $230 did not sell. Should I stick with this lower price until I become more established?
4. This is a big one. I NEVER get feedback. I don't mean to blow my own horn, but I go to great lengths to offer quick, thorough and helpful customer service, I send every buyer a personalized thank you message after purchase, I package my items with great care, but yet still - the only people who leave me feedback are sellers. I have left feedback for every one of my buyers and sellers. How can I increase my feedback rate?
5. I Boost every item I can. This comes out to be $12-$13 per sale that eBay takes, but it has led to many sales. What are your thoughts on boosting? EDIT TO ADD: Are there any estimates on how effective boosting is?

Thank you in advance for any help on these issues!",8,3,2019-01-11,EBAY,0.06065716594457626,0.8938713669776917,0.04547152295708656

Ebay,think i'm being scammed... sold a camera and buyer received a dress instead,"Hope someone can help me on this. I've never had this on ebay before and i'm unsure of what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sold a camera on Ebay in December for \~Â£250. I packaged it up well and posted it with tracked shipping and it all arrived with the buyer fine. 

On christmas day I get a message from the buyer showing that instead of a camera inside the package there is a dress. The package had been really damaged and I could see it had been opened and then resealed at the bottom. At first I thought the package must have been intercepted in the postal service and I got straight on to the courier to try and fix this and see if the camera had been stolen during transport from me to buyer. 

However, I now have reason to believe that the buyer is scamming me. The courier assured me that if they had delivered the parcel in the state it was, they would have put a 'parcel damaged' sticker on it and they also do not think the dress that is pictured would fit in the box(though i'm not sure if i agree with this...)

There are other things I find fishy about the buyer: they have 3370 all positive feedback since august 2013, in the last month they have had 126 positive. Most accounts I see have at least some negative reviews. They also didn't open the package for 6 days after it was delivered, they told me it was because it was a christmas present, but I think if you had bought a fairly expensive camera and the parcel it came in was damaged, then you would want to check that everything was ok? I can see from their account that they buy other camera equipment, so i find it funny that they would wait to open it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss of what is the best way to proceed now, I have so far been very polite to the buyer. They've just opened a returns request and obviously I am reticent to return the money if they have been able to make off with my camera and also get the full payment back. I can fight against them but i'm unsure how to do this and if i can make my case. 

&amp;#x200B;

Could this account be fake? with reviews botted? or do you think the buyer is telling the truth?

Ebay,Got scammed on ebay.. TWICE!,"I attempted to sell an iPhone X to a person in Albania (red flag right there) and they wanted me to reduce the value on the customs shipping label so he wouldn't have to pay high taxes once he received it. I initially agreed and he paid. 

I had second thoughts on it and wrote him saying it's illegal to do that and I will refund him the money. Unfortunately, my PayPal had my old bank account with a zero balance and could not take funds out of my account. PayPal advised me to wait until the refund process is over then add my new account and pay him directly from my updated acct. I did this and the funds were taken out of my account. 

A week later he writes to PayPal/eBay saying he never received the funds because the eCheck was declined even though it already came out of my bank acct. So PayPal gave him the money and put my PayPal in the negative for $750 asking me to add funds to bring it to zero. I contacted eBay and uploaded transaction ID screenshots to show I paid him back. They closed the account in my favor.

The buyer appealed the case he got his money once again. I had to call eBay once again and upload the same documents again plus my bank account showing I paid him. 

How many times can this scammer keep appealing this?!?!?

Ebay,Scammed into negative feedback,"Sooo, I've probably dug myself into a hole I can't get out of, but I figured I'd ask here since you guys on reddit are always so helpful

A couple months ago I sold a blacklisted iPhone on eBay. Once the buyer received the phone, they replied with pictures indicating scratches and dents in the phone that *were not there* before the phone was shipped. The buyer was attempting to get a partial refund, claiming that I didn't describe the item properly. I attempted to explain that my description clearly described the phone being sold ""as is"", and advised the buyer to carefully inspect the pictures and contact me with any questions or requests. He was not happy with me for denying the refund, and left negative feedback claiming my dishonesty. 

As far as I can tell, this person was trying to scam me out of a partial refund by fabricating damage, and then got upset with their plan failing and left negative feedback. I didn't think much about it (besides getting a bit pissed off) until recently, because now I find it significantly harder to sell anything since my 49 100% positive reviews dropped to 48 %85 positive. Unfortunately, I'm not sure there's much I can do considering how long ago this was, and that I don't really have a way to prove that the damage was faked (didn't take the greatest pictures for the listing).

Thoughts on how I could possibly get this settled? Or do I just have to start over? :(",4,4,2019-01-13,EBAY,0.15297693014144897,0.8135042786598206,0.033518772572278976

Ebay,"How to deal with a nagging, unethical buyer?","I'm a small-time seller on eBay, just selling extra closet items in my free time. I've been doing this since 2005 and have a 100% rating from over 500 buyers/sellers.

I've had some unusual messages, but never a loony buyer. On 1/4, a Friday afternoon, this buyer purchased a beauty product, which is listed as a hazardous material in the shipment rules (think aerosols). I shipped it on 1/5, Saturday afternoon, despite my noted 2-day handling time. The item was shipped using a ground service, as stated in my listing, since it's not allowed in the air. 

Following 1/7, I got 3-4 messages daily from her about where her item is. It was only Monday, and the post office doesn't always scan over the weekend, so I told her that the estimated delivery date was 1/12 and to lmk if the product doesn't arrive by then. It didn't matter, as she continued to email me daily, even when the scan finally showed up. By the way, she also had a 100% rating from about 400 buyers/sellers.

Her item was delivered on 1/10, earlier than expected, yet she insisted I refund her the $8 shipping cost because other sellers sent her unrelated items, like shoes and sports gear, faster than that. It honestly annoyed me to no end because her order arrived before the estimated date, but she was an obsessive shipping nut, so I thought a refund would appease her and finally get her out of my life. I refunded the $8 and thought that was the end of that. 

Today, she messages saying that she wants to return the item because she had used it all weekend and did not like the smell! I state clearly in my listing that I cannot accept returns on opened products. I cannot resell a used beauty product! She has opened a case with eBay. I'm worried that eBay will take her side, even though there is documented evidence of all of this on their system. I'm looking at a loss of over $100, including shipping. What should I do?

UPDATE 1: Thanks to everyone for the great advice. I did initially fight her on the shipping refund. I've also had good experiences with refunding shipping for actual delayed shipments, so I figured this would be enough to get her off my case since she only griped about shipping up until that point. 

UPDATE 2: I spoke to eBay. The 1st rep kept talking in circles to avoid taking action, so I calmly asked for a supervisor, who was more understanding and took 10 minutes to read through all the messages. The breakthrough was the message confirming she broke the seal and used the product. The supervisor still tried to convince me to let her return the item but I was stern and told him that eBay's policy clearly states, *""Items must be returned in the same condition in which they were received. Buyers may be liable for loss in value of the item if it's returned in a different condition.""* Then I asked him what the value of a used beauty product was and the answer was 0; thus, a 100% loss in value and no point in returning. Case closed in my favor. Thanks again to everyone who commented.",5,24,2019-01-14,EBAY,0.05318792536854744,0.9059881567955017,0.040823936462402344
Ebay,"Bought phone, describes as perfect itâs not, seller wonât accept return","Bought a phone just before Christmas as a gift for a family member, turned it on quickly to do a quick check and put it back in the box until early January when I met with the family member and gave it to them. Since then the family member has had huge issues with quick battery depletion, took it into a shop and without opening it they say itâs the U2 Tristar chip on the board. This makes sense as the battery health is 84%. Its an expensive repair. The family member gave it back to me as itâs basically unusable. 

I emailed the seller asking to return it and they say no, that I have had it too long and could have done anything to it and told me to sell it on if I donât like it. I couldnât sell it on in its current state without taking a huge loss because I wouldnât lie about the condition of the phone. 

Iâve messaged the seller and told them they have 3 choices, accept the return, pay for the repair or Iâll have to open a dispute with eBay.

Ebay,"Iâm being scammed, please help!","US seller -&gt; US Buyer
 
Iâve been a seller on eBay for over 10 years with a 100% track record. I sell collectible cards and have had 0 issues until the end of 2018. A person with a new account (created in August) won the auction (1,000+)I had in November. He claimed the card was fake but would not provide me proof (I tried working with him asking for picture comparisons, talking to a local professional, etc). He was short with conversation and unwilling to do anything about. He simply wanted a return. The vibe I got from the back and forth was either scam or buyers remorse so I declined to accept the return and the case was escalated. 


Long story short eBay favored the buyer and had me pay for the return since the card was âfraudulentâ. I send the label and go through all the proper channels. The day comes where the buyer should have shipped the card back but there was no tracking update. A few hours later the case is closed. The buyer would not be getting a refund and nothing more was to be done. Great! The buyer decided to keep the card, now worries. Right? Wrong! 


He claims to have shipped the item but the post office hadnât updated the info. I told him not a big deal we will sort it out when it gets here and get his refund back. The package arrives, I sign for it, but, itâs much bigger than a single trading card. I immediately begin recording the opening process and Sure enough, inside is a completely different product. I messaged the seller to inform him of the mix up. He claims it was a mistake, but also mentions the item that he sent (acknowledging and admitting to the mistake without me telling him what it is) within the message. 


I talk to eBay and they state nothing needs to be done and case is closed, but I should continue to work with the seller to fix the mix up. I explain to the buyer that I would be happy to fix the transaction providing he send the correct product. Everything is good.. Right? Wrong again guys.


After several weeks I get an email from PayPal stating that a claim from the buyer has been opened and I now need to provide documentation to help with their investigation. I called ebay again hoping they could provide a single document of all the correspondence between eBay, myself, and the buyer. They tell me I need to print out each individual email (sent AND received) . 


Finally my question(s) to any of you. Has anyone experienced a similar situation where you won the eBay case but still have to deal with PayPal? How likely is it that they side with the buyer? eBay didnât need any evidence from him which scares me about PayPal. Also, is there a better way to print all my messages?",10,7,2019-01-14,EBAY,0.037144456058740616,0.9222345948219299,0.040620990097522736
Ebay,Odd Item Not Received scenario,"Someone purchased three small items for $40 in mid-November, sent via flat rate priority mail envelope. Two days later, USPS scans package as delivered.

I live on the other side of the country. I mailed it to the address that came up in ebay shipping. So I respond in the case with the tracking information that clearly says it was delivered. So far 10 days have passed and the case is still waiting on the buyer to respond.

Today in the mail, I get their package back stating return to sender, unclaimed, unable to forward. How do I handle this without messing with the eBay transaction?

Ebay,Advise dealing with a harassing ebay buyer,"A guy sent me an ebay message last Tuesday with a offer to buy several of my items for one low bulk price.  None of my items have any best-offer, but he sent me a message anyways.  His offer was ridiculously low, after postage, fees from ebay/paypal, I'd make a buck and change in total on 4 items.

He sent me the offer last Tuesday close to midnight my time, I didn't respond until mid-day Thursday saying I was not interested.  A few minutes after I respond, he messages me again, and again, and again, 3x saying that I won't get a better offer from anyone else, I need to be wise and take his offer....

Friday, more messages, Saturday more messages, Sunday more messages and now Monday I have 2 new ones and it's only midday.

So Sunday I put him in my block bidder list, and today (Monday) he's messaging me why I did that, and that he will contact ebay immediately if I don't unblock him.

Anyhow, I'm at the point where I'm starting to worry this guy may be crazy.  Judging by his messaging times middle of the night, early morning, evening, I just don't think he sleeps.  Snooping around his feedback, I deduct he buys cheap Chinese crap alot based on what the sellers that leave him feedback sell.  He rarely leaves feedback to any seller, but when he does, it ranges from positive to negative to neutral.  Interesting note, the positive feedback he leaves always appears to be random letters (i.e.: asdasfkldfjlksdglkzfd), not actual words (is this guy the zodiac???), but for neutral and negative feedback he leaves sentences IN ALL CAPS

Ebay,I have a customer who buys rare Lego sets and opens them.,"I got some amazing deals on brand new, but rather old, collectible sets. I got bored with them fast, and hit money trouble, so I decided to sell them. One buyer came around a few times, buying only one set at a time.

Another odd thing he did was critique my methods of shipping. He would message me after every buy, then after every package he got. He was just offering constructive criticism, which I appreciate. 

Now the very, very weird part. One of his first messages, he critiqued the fact the (white) pieces were discoloured and frayed. Which is expected when the pieces have been flying around in a container for nearly 20 years. But why buy new if you'll just open it?

I had the same sets as the new ones, but they were loose. I told him several times he could buy those instead and save a bunch of money. He just ignored that part. He purchased three different sets from me, all three I had 100% complete in other listings.

Ebay,As a New User I am the Constant Target of Foreign Scammers Using Reshipping Addresses in the US - and I'm Winning,"I have only been on ebay for around 3 months now.

One of my first transactions was for a busted iPhone 6. Only $50. I actually posted about it here.

The buyer was based in Russia and using an American reshipping address. If you don't know what that is, it's an American business similar to a post office box where the customer is assigned an account identifier (""73HD9225""). Then any mail received at that address with that number in the address is reshipped/forwarded to a secondary address. It is not in and of itself a scam; there are practical reasons for having such a thing, but the service is RIFE with fraud by foreign eBayers trying to get around sellers like myself who don't ship internationally.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have discovered is there are clearly scammers who seek out tech items for sale by new and potentially naive eBay sellers, especially if there is an ""offer"" function on a listing. They put in an offer that's reasonable, and win the auction. They pay, and then the item is shipped to the American address and then reshipped to the secondary address. It is almost always in Russia/Ukraine or Africa (Nigeria especially); sometimes China.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the package arrives - or sometimes before (I'll get to that) - they open up a claim/request saying the item was not as received. They MIGHT simply message you outside of a claim and say something like ""I got this item but there is some slight damage that makes the condition different than you're listing. I paid you $300, if you will refund me $75 I will accept it and avoid a claim."" This is more of the long game, but it does net them a profit in the end. But more often than not they will say ""I got your package and the item is not inside at all/something else was in the package"" and file a claim requesting a refund.

With the iphone I mentioned above, the seller claimed there was a CD inside instead. They uploaded photos of the alleged CD. They opened up a case with only a few days left in the month long window to do so. This is because of course it took nearly a month for the package to be forwarded to them in Russia.

AFTER the buyer opened that claim, I started researching the situation. The first thing I noticed was that despite providing a Delaware address, their profile said the user was registered in Russia. I then googled the address provided and came up with countless accusations of ebay fraud relating to this address, and those many posts taught me what a reshipping address even is.

Ultimately I called eBay and reported my findings, and they very quickly investigated the user and closed their account, which caused me some grief because the request/case hadn't been closed yet and they couldn't manually close it in my favor when the person who filed had a suspended account. After 30 days the request was automatically closed, and I got my money back.

Well. Since that incident, over the last 3 months this has happened to me two more times, in almost identical scenarios.In both cases they were low end laptops, newer models but cheap. In both cases the buyer used an American reshipping address. In the first of these two, I really should have checked to see where the buyer was registered from before accepting the ""best offer"", and I also didn't notice that familiar string of letters/numbers in the address. I shipped out the laptop, it was delivered ASAP, paypal released my funds, and then two days later I got photos of literally garbage from the trash can saying that was what had been shipped. The buyer had asked the reshipping company (a different one) to open the package before forwarding it, so it hadn't even reached him in the Ukraine yet. The buyer opened a claim and ebay initially sided in their favor. I researched the address like last time, called ebay and started an appeal. This time I was armed with a ton of information including their Ukraine registration address, google links to other complaints of fraud from this address, and most importantly the fact that the mailing OUT weight on the package did not align with the weight of the garbage on display in the photos. eBay reversed their decision and sided in my favor.

It's important to note: eBay's rules say a buyer is not entitled to a money back guarantee if a third party address is involved in your transaction. You can read about that here: [https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy?id=4210#eligibility](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy/ebay-money-back-guarantee-policy?id=4210#eligibility)

&amp;#x200B;

Well. Cut to about two weeks ago. Another inexpensive laptop\* listed, another best offer received. This time I looked at the person's ebay profile before agreeing. Located in: Nigeria. (Since this began the address has been changed to Mongolia.) But shipping to an address in Illinois. With once again that familiar string of random characters/numbers in the address. I googled the address. Nothing came up associating it with a reshipping company, but in fact it came up as a laundromat. I googled the person's name, found their Facebook page, it showed them living in Mongolia with recent photos; the name on the Facebook page was slightly different in spelling than the eBay listing.

I thought to myself, self, this may be stupid, but let's see how this plays out. I packaged up the laptop and had my housemate literally film me doing it, taping it up, affixing the postage label and then walking it four blocks up the street to the post office to drop it off with no opportunity for it to have been somehow changed up before shipping. I paid for one day shipping and required signature for delivery. I affixed a huge page to the box that read ""Please note that if this package is being forwarded to an address in a foreign country, it may constitute mail fraud to open this package if you are not the addressee shown on the mailing label.""

Sure enough, it arrived 2 days later. Paypal released my funds which I quickly deposited. The signature accepting the package was for a different name than the buyer. The next day the buyer opened a request claiming that the package contained some kind of small wooden box and not a laptop. I immediately messaged the person within the claim on ebay itself saying How did you manage to even receive the package so quickly? I know you are using an American forwarding address but are actually located in Nigeria (which I thought was the case based on the info at the time.) He responded back saying that this was his American business address and he was not in Nigeria (technically true since he is in Mongolia as it turns out) and that a colleague had opened the package for him before forwarding it.

I called ebay right away armed with all of this evidence, the most damning of which is his confession that he had the package shipped to an address other than his own with someone else accepting it. It took the eBay representative less than 2 minutes to close the request in my favor and release my funds. For the past 5 days the buyer has been sending me 5-10 ebay messages a day insisting that they are not in another country, but when I ask them to send me back the alleged item that was in the box they say they cannot/do not have the box. When I tell them they should go to the police and file a fraud claim, they say they cannot, but continue to send a chain of messages begging me to send them the laptop. ""Please send me the laptop."" ""Please I cannot have this empty box."" Also, their messages all come in when it is like 1-3AM American time, but middle of the day in MONGOLIA ... I do have to say in this case it may be possible that the buyer may be a victim to the reshipping place, but sadly that is still not my problem.

&amp;#x200B;

The bottom line is this scam - whether perpetuated by buyers or the actual people who run the reshipping companies (or both) - seems to be increasingly common. There are surely far less aware and less willing-to-investigate new sellers out there who aren't as savvy as I am in defending themselves against it. Some ebayers will tell you the best way to avoid it is not selling expensive things on ebay, which isn't really a reasonable thing to say. There's nothing wrong with ebay in principle as long as you don't go in naively (like I originally did) and you take reasonable measures to protect yourself.

Ebay,"Is anyone else sick of Ebay activating ""Best offers"" automatically?","I've been getting back in the Ebay selling game and have been listing items that are very reasonably priced and usually are the cheapest out of most other sellers' listings. I usually sell after about a week or two on certain items since they're not in high demand, but God forbid it take that long to sell something. I'm just getting really annoyed with having to go back and revise each listing to disable the ""Best Offer"" option that Ebay keeps enabling. If I wanted offers on or wanted to change my mind and turn them on, I can do so, I'm a big boy. It's just pissing me off because it's MY listing! Yes I'm using Ebay as a medium for conducting my sales, but in the end,  I should be the one to decide what price point I want to try selling my item for and if I'm firm on that price, so be it.

I bought an electronic item on ebay that arrived broken (a plastic piece literally missing that renders it useless).

Regardless, this is a seller with 600+ items and active listings.

I opened a return request and included photos and a few days later I just get a notification that the seller declined my return request. Oddly, it does have the sellers address at the bottom of the e-mail, should I just mail it back?

Ebay,"Bought something from China in September; shipping window ended a few days ago. Item has not arrived. Opened INR, seller saying item was delivered back in October.","Hi guys, bit of a weird twist on an Item Not Received case. Will try to keep details succinct to avoid needing a TLDR.

Back on September 26, I bought a robot vacuum from a Seller on Ebay. Order 'shipped' a couple days later, saying the delivery window was sometime between late November and January 14th. (It was free economy shipping)  


That time frame has come and past, and I have not received my item. I live in an apartment building; I have religiously checked almost every day, both the building's office where packages sometimes get delivered, and my mailbox for any delivery attempt notices. Nothing, for the entire time.

I've messaged the seller a couple times over the last few months, letting them know I have not received my item. They kept saying to wait until the end of the shipping window, which is fair.

Anyways, that time has come and gone. So the day after the shipping window ended, I opened an Item Not Received case against the seller. They responded with 'tracking information', which is nothing more than what would show up when a package is delivered: "" 2018-10-30 13:59 AJAX,ON, Delivered to your community mailbox, parcel locker or apt./condo mailbox"". No actual tracking number, just that sentence added as 'tracking information.'  


I'm now suspicious that he's a scammer. I've had a lot of packages delivered to my building, and this is the only one that has mysteriously been delivered but apparently turned into a ghost.

His information also says it was 'delivered to my mailbox,' but my mailbox can barely fit envelopes in it. Everything else that has been delivered has been to 'the office/concierge'. 

He also has yet to provide actual apparent tracking information to prove his claim.

I also find it dubious that it says it was delivered back in October, when the shipping window didn't even OPEN until late November.

Ebay,eBay does have some seller protection,"I sold a $300 item to someone in CA. The buyer opened a return saying he purchased my item by mistake and he shipped back an empty box. My item was 6 pounds but the empty box he sent back was shipped with first class mail. I expected this to be an easy win for me since you can't send back a 6 pound item with first class mail, however when I called, eBay said they don't look at that information (why? I don't know). They said the only hope was that this buyer had previous complaints from other sellers for doing the same thing and there was a ""pattern"" of this behavior. 

After looking through the buyer's account the ebay rep said he saw my report that the buyer returned an empty box but that I was the only one for this account. That was proof that my report actually went through and was on the buyer's account. Since this was a low feedback account he saw that this buyer had many other accounts that were linked to him. He said he would send all the information to the trust and safety team and they would investigate his other accounts and get back to me. After a few hours they called me back and said his other accounts showed a pattern of bad behavior and they removed all buyer protection from this user and found in my favor.

He said from past experiences buyers like this always open chargebacks when things don't go their way and I probably won't be protected from that.

My point is if you have a buyer that scams you, **make sure you report them**. It may not help your case, but it will give future sellers more protection. eBay does keep track of all reports you give, and there is some seller protection from abusive buyers.",24,84,2019-01-17,EBAY,0.09158691018819809,0.8788750767707825,0.029537983238697052
Ebay,Think I may be getting scammed as a seller of $1900 Macbook Pro,"Hey all

soo I've been a eBay member 13 years and never had a bad experience.. until now :( So recently upgraded from my 2017 Macbook Pro 13"" to the 2018 model. Loving the upgrade and my work really benefits from two having the two extra CPU cores in the new model.

Anyways so I was needing to sell my older model to cover the expense of the upgrade. I decided to use eBay to do so. It was bough from a buyer in Texas for $1900. It's a good deal as equiv refurbished spec machine with Apple Care goes for $2648 from [Apple.com](https://Apple.com) store and had a lot of offers coming in. It's it excellent condition, bar the faintest scratch on the trackpad, which I disclosed to the buyer.

He paid upfront and I specifically listed it as ""no refunds"" because I knew it was 1) a good deal 2) excellent condition 3) came with Apple Care for extra peace of mind. It's the kind of machine I'd want to buy if the roles were reversed.

I shipped it meticulously cleaned and packaged in double boxed in the original Apple packaging. Both the inner white box and the outer brown box. Also sent it free 2-day shipping via Fedex.

The MBP was delivered on time, but as soon as he received the machine he issued a refund request stating it had a large crack in the trackpad and claiming it was dirty!! (what on earth??)

He send 4 pictures in grainy low light conditions and only 1 of the pictures shows the supposed crack.

The 'dirty' part seems to be styrofoam sprinkled over it. Which again is strange since the packaging doesn't contain styrofoam. The crack also appear to have a weird blotch or smudge in the middle of it. Keep this in mind as we'll come back to this point.

Anyways so I'm freaking out and so I asked for him to video call so I could verify these wild claims. He declined (ok fair enough some buyers might find that intimidating), then I asked him to submit a video (which is much harder to fake) and he kept dodging and eventually refused. Then I asked him to at the very least send more photos of the 'cracked trackpad'. He sent 2 more photos but again only 1 image had showed the crack. This time however, the crack was 'smudged' in two places!

I'm terrified if I accept return I'm gonna be out a lot of money and get back another machine or empty box with stones in it or something, given the shadyness going on.

Uploaded all the images sent by the buyer. [https://imgur.com/a/QRbF11U](https://imgur.com/a/QRbF11U) ( chronological order)

Images I took before shipping: [https://imgur.com/a/2d7YMEB](https://imgur.com/a/2d7YMEB)

What do you guys think? What should I do.. freaking out bigtime here as it's a \*lot\* of money on the line. stressing all night and can't sleep. no-one should have to deal with this.. I feel sick to my stomach :(

\-- UPDATE 1 -- (Jan 17 9:49 EST)

Just spoke with eBay again little while ago and pointed out the inconsistencies in the photo's. The agent was courteous but also firm that it would be best to accept the return despite the sketchy photos.

One possible angle is maybe the buyer really does have buyers remorse but also perhaps doesn't want to pay for the return shipping, so are claiming damage (in this instance the Seller pays).

Another possibility that others have mentioned, is that they were hoping for a discount (ie partial refund).

So at this point I'm a little unsure whether to offer the buyer say $100 off, or to rather just accept the return and hope what arrives back is my machine.

\-- UPDATE 2 -- (Jan 18 8:20 EST)

PLOT TWIST. The buyer has now given more pictures and a video and the crack definitely now looks real. Yes I know it's hard to believe. It must have just been a freak accident or something during shipping. It still makes no sense, but the crack is real. He took a picture at the Apple store.

Ebay,Vendor on Ebay keeps 'selling' me products I didn't order,"Hi:

&amp;#x200B;

I've had an interesting happening. I got a notice from an ebay vendor that the item I had purchased was ready for delivery, for an item that I have never seen before. I asked to cancel transaction, and within a couple of days they refunded the purchase price. Then a couple of weeks later the same thing happened, with the same vendor.

&amp;#x200B;

A little while ago I purchased a Nintendo 3DS game and received the game case with no game in it. But I knew that this was just a mistake. (Kinda long story, I'll post it after my main point for those who are interested)

So I messaged the seller and let them know that I received it empty. No claim opened, no bad feedback, I literally just let him know and asked if he knew where it was.

Maybe 5 minutes after I sent the message, the seller sends me an all-caps message screaming about how I'm a scammer, I'm ruining eBay, he's closing his bank/PayPal account, and how he's going to leave the website because of me. He even left me a positive feedback that said I was a scammer.

The crazy response annoyed me, so I just opened up a claim and I ended up getting my refund.

Yesterday the seller messaged me (this was almost two months after I bought the item, by the way) and apologized profusely because he found the game in his son's 3DS.

&amp;#x200B;

**Moral of the story**: Unfortunately, the internet is only getting worse for fraud and theft. It's easy to get jaded and suspect the worst from everybody. Yes, there are people out there who are dishonest, but that's not *always* the case. Of course you should do everything you can in your power to protect yourself. Just be wary of jumping to conclusions.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I bought a 3DS game and only received the game case. Seller thought I was trying to scam him and apologized months later after finding it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Side story of why I trusted him:** I knew this was an accident because I just trusted this seller. You could tell it was just an old guy. After I bought it, he sent a message thanking me for buying it and told me that he was a veteran and that the payment was helping support his family. He was supposed to ship it within 2 business days, but he still hadn't shipped it almost 2 weeks after I paid. So I messaged him and asked if he had a tracking number and he went on a little tangent about how he is so forgetful at his age and apologized. He was selling random home items and my gut just told me he was telling the truth. He was very bad at typing and just seemed genuine.

Ebay,Empty Box claim from buyer,"I am a seller. I sold a brand new box of automotive tape rolls ($100) to a buyer which was packaged very nicely in a box, sealed and taped up. I shipped out the box via USPS priority mail, and 3 days later, I got a message from the buyer saying the words that anyone would dread to hear - ""I received your package today and it was empty. How can I get the item I ordered?"".
Crap.
My first thought was ""hmm, it's pretty rare for that to ever actually happen. You hear some horror stories, but surely this cannot be the case..""

At this point, most people would be panicking, posting on social media, endlessly calling eBay, accusing the buyer asking for live video feed, dozens of pictures, a sworn affidavit and whatever crazy overreactions you can come up with..

Instead, I messaged the buyer and said ""I am terribly sorry to hear about the package, please allow me to work with you on getting this corrected for you. Would you prefer a refund, or a replacement to be shipped out to you? Also, it would help me a great deal if you could send me a picture of the box so that I can contact the post office with this information to help file a claim. I'll make sure you get a refund or replacement no matter what and you don't have to worry about the insurance claim, I will take care of that on my end since it's my responsibility.""

Buyer: ""Okay, a replacement would be great""
Buyer: provided 3 pictures of the box showing the side of the box totally blown out/ripped open and had stamps all over it saying ""contents missing"".

Me: thinking to myself, damn.. a legit empty box. I didn't really believe it would happen, but it did..

Me: ""Thanks for the pictures. I will send out the replacement first thing tomorrow.""

Me: in the mean time, I submitted an insurance claim with USPS.

Buyer got the replacement just fine, thanked me for the quick resolution, and gave me a great feedback. About 2 weeks later, I got a check from USPS in the mail for $90 since it was already insured with priority mail.

We'll...that's really it. Sorry for the bland story. No police, no endless calls to eBay to complain, no threats, no explosions. Just a crappy situation that turned out great by doing what any good seller should do. Take care of your buyers, believe in the good, and insure your package if you can't afford to take the loss. It's not the buyer's fault. It's not eBay's fault. I was the seller. My obligation is to get the item to my buyers on time and in the condition described. The buyer didn't pay for excuses.

Ebay,"Thoughts on leaving negative, neutral, or positive feedback on an item I returned?","I recently ordered an item on eBay. Paid right away and the seller shipped it out reasonably quickly. I get the item, and they sent me what appeared to be the wrong thing. I sent the seller a message asking if he could confirm my suspicion. I waited 2 days and didn't get a response. I checked the seller's other listings and confirmed I received the wrong item, and I messaged him again. Waited another full day and still no response. I initiated a return and shipped the item back the next day. I received my refund 2 days after the item was delivered. So, I got my money back, but I'm not super satisfied. I ended up having to order it on Amazon since this seller is the only person on eBay selling this item.

I sell the occasional (for parts &amp; not working item)

The other day I sold something, that was as is (for parts &amp; not working), no returns. It was clearly damaged, and sold for less than 10% of retail value. $3000+ machine sold for $250.


Buyer starts case today claiming ""arrived damaged""... Buyer says they can't repair it through manufacturer, as it was previously damaged upon arrival to manufacturer.. They blamed me for this, but this isn't information I was privy to.


eBay (via Twitter) says they won't do anything right now, as buyer claimed it was damaged. Anyway, I've fought many of these in the past, but eBay keeps changing. What have you all experienced lately? Do I have a good chance?

Ebay,Listing Items Separately AND In A Bundle?,"Hello. I have a bunch of old video games I want to list on eBay. I am torn between listing them one by one, or altogether as a bundle.

Is it against eBay policy to list them as a bundle AND list them separately? Please note that the moment an individual game sold, I would remove the listing for the bundle, and vice versa. 

If somehow the bundle and a game sold within seconds of one another, I would buy a brand new copy of whichever individual game sold and send it to the buyer.

Ebay,Help! eBay still havenât refunded me my Â£650 after 1 month,"Hi Reddit, so just a little background on this: Iâve had my eBay account since 2003, back when you paid for stuff with cheques instead of PayPal. Anyway, Iâve bought 100âs of items and sold 100âs of items throughout the years with very little issue and have over 2,000 feedback on my account. 

However, I purchased a designer jacket in early December, from a top rated seller who claimed it was 100% authentic. I paid Â£650. 

When I received the jacket, it was clear it was a counterfeit. I sent pictures of everything to the manufacturer and they e-mailed me back confirming it was counterfeit and I should pursue a refund. 

I called eBay, sent them the e-mails from the manufacturer, and they told me since I had proof it was counterfeit that I should not risk sending the item back, and that eBay will personally refund me. They sent me a form to fill in to ensure I would destroy the item upon receiving a refund. 

That was on 18th Dec, itâs now 20th Jan, Iâve since called eBay a further 6 times and on 3 of those occasions the escalation team PROMISED me I would receive my refund within 48 hours, I still have nothing.

Anyway, I accepted a return on an item. This item was a vintage software set that required an older operating system to use--as I specified. Homeboy first shows that he's going to be a problem by trying to demand that I meet him in person as he lives in the same state. I reminded him that the listing said no in-person meetups and that all items would be shipped via regular mail. He then gets the item, immediately tells me it doesn't work as he can't figure out how to use it. I instruct him to start a return and then accept the return; he waits \*seven days\* so he can leave me negative feedback (as I am a Top-Rated Seller) and then waits till the eleventh hour to ship the item back to me.

Of course, as a seller, I can only leave a ""sellers beware"" comment as a positive for him. (Not trying to be passive aggressive but I felt others should be warned.)

Ebay,Power seller sends wrong item; goes nuts when I SNAD; screenshots save the day,"This douchey seller I bought from with over 15,000, 100% feedbacks sent me a different, damaged item, cost less than $15. When I messaged them they accused me of switching it with a different item and lying. I guess because of their power seller status, an eBay rep called me within 10 minutes, and was going through my purchases saying that as I'd bought similar items recently, I must have got confused over the items! Um, no. Theirs came with a business card and was distinctive.

They told me to start a SNAD, within 5 minutes the seller asked eBay to step in.

Then I decided to search the seller's sold listings for similar items...and boom! There was the item I'd been sent, listed as sold in October with the exact same title as the one I'd bought. I guess someone either returned it or was themselves sent the wrong thing. I took screenshots, copy&amp;pasted the item number. I couldn't add anything to the dispute so I just sent it to the seller. Boy did they change their tune once they'd been found out!

Now they say I can keep the item and get a refund from eBay. I hate the item so I'll just send it back anyway as it's useless to me!

Ebay,"Sold a very expensive bag, buyer claims it's fake after &gt; 2 months. Buyer filed a chargeback with their bank. I provided all evidence of authenticity, but PayPal/bank sided with the buyer. Now worried buyer may screw me over even further if I accept the return.","----- ****UPDATED AT THE END OF POST**** - - - - - 

Context: been a seller (small time, don't do this as a profession) at eBay for about 4 years. Never had any issues with buyers. I don't sell fake or bad items, and am very careful with following the required steps, process and channels for making sales.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, sold a very expensive bag (\~$4500 USD). Out of nowhere, the buyer, more than 2 months later, initiated a CHARGEBACK for the purchase, claiming the bag was fake. This was shocking because I actually bought this bag from the flagship store of this brand in Chicago. This claim was obviously bull shit. 

The buyer DID NOT reach to me,ebay or PayPal and instead directly reached out to the bank. This to me was a major red flag 

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out she used some third party authenticity company to get some document saying that the bag is fake. Again - that's impossible because all the receipts and authenticity proofs are there, and the fact that I bought this from the brand's store itself. When I reached out to this authenticity company that claimed the bag is fake, and I provided all evidence, seems like the buyer did not give enough evidence and gave bad/hazy pictures. The company told me to ask the buyer to submit the info again with ALL information (clear pics, receipts, authenticity card) so that they conclusively say its real. And, surprise surprise, the buyer refuses to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

In talking to this buyer, I discovered that this person was buying this expensive item along with some friends, and the friends seemed to have backed out and now she can't afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, PayPal (or the bank of this buyer) sided with the buyer and I'm basically stuck.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my PayPal account is negative $4500. As I understand it, To make matters worse because this was filed as a chargeback, **IF** the buyer sends me back the bag damaged or is missing items, PayPal will apparently NOT protect me as the seller, given they do not protect the seller if a chargeback was filed (is this true?). PayPal recommended I submit this case to [ic3.gov](https://ic3.gov) (internet crime complaint?).

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, as I understand it, eBay cannot protect me either because this dispute was not opened through eBay, it was filed through the buyer's bank as a chargeback. Needless to say, the bank of the buyer has sided with this buyer, and I am not protected by eBay or PayPal for this item given it was filed as a chargeback. Again - I am not even sure if this is the right info (Just doesn't sound right to me), but this is what I have been told by the folks on the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

So my Questions are:

1. Is there any way I can win this thing? What options do I have?

I am not a scammer or a liar, but this buyer is clearly up to no good. I have all the proof of authenticity, and how this buyer is being devious.

&amp;#x200B;

2. More importantly, **IF** I decide to end this to avoid heartache and stress, **how can I protect myself from this buyer who is clearly being devious?** What **IF** the buyer sends back this item damaged, or sends a fake bag back, or worse yet, nothing at all (empty box). How do I protect myself as this is a very expensive item? Am I actually not protected from eBay or PayPal or this bank?

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I don't mind taking back the bag, but given that the buyer is devious, **I want to protect myself from this worst-case scenario.**

&amp;#x200B;

Any other advice you can give me? I am obviously very stressed about this, and would prefer that the buyer is punished for this and pays for the purchase. But a part of me is scared because as a seller I'm being screwed and I don't wanna lose the bag and be out $4500.

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE help me with this. Appreciate any guidance or advice.

&amp;#x200B;

----ââ--------- updates below 

***UPDATE1*** : after getting all the great advice from you all, I did the following:

1. Reached out to PayPal to reopen the case, they did. Results still pending. 

The general feedback I got here and from PayPal is that in charge back cases, the buyer is usually favored as PayPal can't do much. Best situation to be in is just resolving it with the buyer as the there is a lot of money involved and an expensive bag on the line. 

2. Next, I reached out to the buyer and we exchanged multiple emails. I honestly outlined everything that had happened, and that I fear that the buyer may be scamming me. I also outlined legal options I had. Turns out the buyer was willing to work with me to resolve the case. She Stuck to the story of ""buying it with friends"" and felt that she was misled by authentication company. But regardless, felt that she was being scammed as well. Was very reassuring that she wasn't going to scam and is happy to send the bag back. Exchanged a couple of emails on this topic, and ended up agreeing that she should start the return process throguh official channels. Told the buyer that I will be documenting the receiving (video of receiving and opening the bag) of the bag in case there is foul play. And if there is foul play, would engage lawyers/ police. The buyer even sent her direct line (##) and said to call her as soon as I receive the bag. Buyer Also sent a lot of explanation aorund how she's not trying to scam and that she has the bag in the same condition as she received it. 

3. Wrote to PayPal executive office, eBay support and PayPal support. Either haven't heard back or they haven't been helpful. 

4. Reached out to the ""authentication"" company and gave more proof of purchase and authenticity. Haven't heard back, but will be following up with them again. 

I understand that I have the option of proving this to be a case of  buyers remorse, but honestly, because of the system of eBay, PayPal, and banks, along with the buyer getting the ""authentication"" from that stupid authentication company, there is a big chance the buyer wins this and then i have to put in a lot of effort (police, lawyers, travel) to get my money or bag back. I know I would get my money or bag back eventually, but who knows how long that takes. It's too high of a risk to not give this bag return a shot. I chose not to take the hard road and exercise the option of at least getting the bag back. If I get it back, well and good. If not, I'll have to engage the law and I have to fight

In summary: buyer has said that they will return the real bag, in original condition. PayPal and eBay have not been helpful. I'm awaiting the shipment of the bag and receiving it. Will keep you all updated! 

Thanks for all your support!! I was in bad shape will I started hear from everyone.

Ebay,"I don't understand the motivation behind people who bid on something you're selling, win the auction, and then just completely ghost you.","Like, I completely understand if someone is the winning bid and then messages you immediately after saying they can no longer purchase the item (because they accidentally made a typo on how much money they wanted to bid, etc.). Shit happens. BUT, when they become the winning bid, and then don't message you at all for days on end UNTIL you open an unpaid item case and then they request a cancellation, you're opening a can of worms by choice. 

Had you just messaged me a day earlier when I was sending you my invoices and payment reminders, we would have been able to cancel it and had no further issue. Now that you waited until the UIC was open, we now can't cancel it until it is closed automatically, which takes about 4 days according to eBay support.

I don't understand the motivation behind people who do this. What are they gaining out of it? To me, they're not only not gaining anything, but they are actually inconveniencing themselves by making something easy now way more complicated than it was meant to be.

Ebay in less than 1 sec reviewed and processed the complaint in favor of the buyer. 

I wrote them an email explaining how this was clearly a case of buyers remorse. I also sent a few picture of the non-opened product to prove that the claim was false.

Ebay,Buyer on my item has feedback stating he switched out working item for faulty item which is making me feel uncomfortable.,"I'm selling a brand new item in the box. He purchased and paid immediately. As usual I scan through their feedback and I noticed that a person has accused the buyer of switching out faulty product for a working one and returning it. This is making me very uncomfortable about dealing with this person as I know eBay isn't exactly fair towards sellers when it comes to these situations and almost always sides with the buyer. I'd be pretty pissed if he did this to me, And I don't like seeing this type of feedback in someones account.

Ebay,"received an item that isn't as described, is it reasonable to ask for a partial refund for what this will cost me rather than what it's worth on amazon?","hey, sorry for the jumbled title i really tried to clean it up  
anyway, i got a laptop recently from ebay in the US, seller listed it having a ""960 pro"" NVMe but turns out it has a ""960 evo"" instead, which is cheaper, i believe the seller made a mistake since i asked him for the drive's stats before buying and he sent me a photo, but when i rechecked it now turns out it's listed as 960 evo in there, but i didn't notice before.  
anyway, what i was planning to do is sell this drive outside of the USA in my home country, which will probably net me ~$200, but since it turned out to be a 960 evo i don't think i'll be able to sell it for more than ~$120-130, and so losing me $70-80.  
but on amazon the difference between them(new) is smaller at $40.  
so now im not sure, this mistake by the seller will cost me ~$80, but the price difference in the US is $40, is it reasonable to ask for a $70-80 partial refund since that is what it will cost me, or should i ask for a $40 one instead?

Ebay,New Ebay Account Suspended - Concerned About ~$300 Purchase,"Hi Reddit! I've been a long time lurker, but I'm extremely concerned about my money and I need help. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am a watch enthusiast, especially mechanical wrist watches and I was looking to get myself another one. I had decided on a Seiko SRPA21 ""Turtle"" PADI Edition. Usually all of my purchases come from Amazon, but I've been hearing about people getting the SRPA21 for close to $200 online. Amazon's prices were around $330, but I looked on Ebay and saw that all of them were $20-$50 below $300. Naturally these prices appealed to me and as a first time buyer on Ebay, I began to do some research. I told my friend about this and he offered to buy me around $250 worth in Ebay gift cards (I had bought him PC games/PC Components before). So I had my Ebay gift cards and was set on buying my watch along with another spring bar tool and link removing hammer and punch. I made my purchase two days ago using the gift card and Paypal and thought it was done. But two days later, today, I received an email saying that my account was suspended, I thought this was a fake message at first, so to make sure I tried to login to my Ebay account and I saw that my Ebay account was actually suspended.

I wasn't sure what I did so I spent an hour finding out what I could be suspended for as there's not really a reason stated for my suspension. I found some conflicting information on having multiple accounts and I remembered that I accidentally used my little sibling's email to setup an account, but realized my error and made a new account with my personal email. On the other account the most I've done is link my address and Paypal as well as put the same watch that I bought on my personal account in my cart. That is all that I have done. On the account with my personal email, all I have done is link my address and Paypal, bought the watch, spring bar tool, and link removing punch and hammer. I am really concerned, $300 might not be a lot to some people, but for me college education is expensive and I don't have much left after to enjoy myself.

A few hours after he paid, he wanted an invoice from me via Paypal. It's need a bit weird, please help! I have several questions:

1. Why does he need a invoice? Isn't invoice suppose to REQUEST payment from buyer? He already paid though. And he has an the information on ebay
2. Why does he want a invoice via Paypal?
3. Is invoice acting like a receipt there?
4. he ""Paid"" me, but the money is held by ebay, does this count as he paid? I just dont want him to say oh you gave me a receipt, a proof of payment, and then withdraw the money before 21 days
5. Paypal doesn't show his email. I need his email to send him a electronic invoice. Should I ask him via ebay messenger what his personal email is? Is there a way to get his email on ebay or paypal?

Ebay,Item shipped to wrong address,"I purchased a package for $159 on eBay on December 30. After the tracking was uploaded, I noticed that the package was coming from Germany when it was listed as coming from Portland, OR and the seller was marked as ""based in the United States"". Whatever, I didn't think too much of it. Then the item was marked as delivered on January 14, and I didn't receive anything. I decided to contact my local post office to get more info. They told me that the package with the tracking number the seller gave me was delivered to an address on the other side of town (they gave me the exact address) and that it was a ""small packet"" (as it said on the tracking info page). This was confirmed by the man in the office as well as by mailman himself. I contacted the seller to verify the address and tracking number, but all he said was that the package was delivered and nothing more. Again, I asked the seller to verify the address and tracking number, but he didn't respond. I waited until 1 week after the item was marked as delivered, then officially opened a case with eBay for not receiving the item. This got him to respond, and he said that he contacted the carrier and confirmed that the package was delivered. I still had nothing. Two days later, eBay closed the case stating that the seller was able to provide tracking that confirmed the package was delivered to my address. Four other people have reported the same problem with this seller in the past month through negative feedback (he had 1 positive seller review when we all bought our items). What can I do from here? 

Edit: I contacted eBay and they seemed quite willing to help. They told me to get an Intranet Report from my local post office to verify that the package was delivered to the wrong address and after I upload it they will take the funds from the seller and return them to me.

Ebay,Do I send this jersey this customer paid for?,"So this customer offered a low amount for a jersey. I declined and then I messaged them it was too low.

He messaged me saying he needed that jersey for this date and wanted me to accept. I said I couldn't.

The next day it was purchased at full price by someone with zero feedback. Created just the same day. Similar names, and the guy's real name is in the original messager's screen name. I'm thinking about messaging him and calling him on his bluff.

I'm 99% sure it's the same person. Not sure what's going on but do I ship out the item and risk whatever he's going to do? Probably say it was damaged. Is there any way I can cancel and not get a negative feedback?

Ebay,What feedback does this warrant?,"So I bought a computer docking station and power cord off eBay for $21.20 ($7.70 + $13.50 shipping). The guy shipped the items (weighing 2 lbs) to me in an unpadded paper manila envelope, which arrived all torn up with a USPS ""I'm sorry"" plastic wrapper and apology letter. Anyways, the power cord's plastic shielding was separated from the power block with two exposed wires sticking out (see photo in link below). After blowing up the photo from his original listing (see photo above), you can just barely see the same exposed wires, which means it wasn't damaged by USPS. This is obviously not safe and should have been disclosed in his listing's description (it wasn't) and he probably should have just thrown it away and not resold on eBay. (see photo from his listing and what I received https://imgur.com/a/9neYHlY)

Based off all I've learned in this sub, I asked him for a full refund, and also a prepaid return shipping label unless he wanted me to just dispose of it. Told him I'd even package it properly this time :) Seller responds with ""Sorry to hear that. It was pictured in the listing and worked when i sent. You paid $7 so $5 refund seems reasonable.

Ebay,Is my TRS worth it?,"Hello! I'm a TRS who mainly deals with electronics. In my situation, a lot of people return things for stupid reasons (like  having issues getting it to work with their machine, or it isn't compatible with their machine). This caused my return rate to be a bit higher than average. I'm not a volume seller, most my items are between $50 - $200, so I maybe get around 500 transactions a year. I don't offer free 30 day returns or next day shipping to qualify for the final fee discount.

To lower my return rate, I recently started selling some low cost cables ($3), magic cards, and shipping them via usps mail(55 cents). I obviously can't add tracking on these, since the shipping cost would cost more than what the item is worth. I've sold quite a few of these so far, and it's brought down my return rate a bit. Only issue is, since I don't have tracking #s for these (people always get their item no matter what, and I haven't had anyone claim that they haven't. If they do I will refund them fully immediately), my tracking number rate is going below 95%, causing me to become above standard.

My question is, is it even worth for me to be a TRS? I can actually see myself making a little bit extra a month shipping these out, and some people buy in bulk. I have a ton of these laying around my workshop, so I stand to make quite a bit if I sell them all. If my tracking upload rate goes below, let's say 80%, would it ever put me below standard? Does it reduce my visibility if I go to above standard?

Anyone in a similar situation?

Ebay,Poor experience with shutl via ebay UK,"Sold a for parts iphone a couple weeks ago, decided to go with this new shutl service ebay are pushing as it's through Hermes who I've personally had no problem with in the last two years of using them. However, the parcel gets lost in their regional depot. 

I wait weeks and decide to refund the buyer and make a claim. Initially I went straight to hermes to claim as it was their warehouse but apparently because it was booked through shutl they have their own claims form. Shutl's claim form however is a poor google docs form with hardly any information and I was never contacted back. After emailing them, they have become unresponsive to my emails. I tried to find a phone number (which doesn't exist) and even a link to a live chat so I can work this out in real time, but there's nothing!?

Now I get that shutl is probably used by many and does probably work, but I wouldn't take the risk anymore in case something goes wrong. If something goes wrong, you're left in the lurch as shutl are useless and go quiet. Book direct through Hermes so at least if something goes wrong you can make a claim with them who actually follow up pretty well. Pathetic service and I'm left out of pocket for their mistake.

Ebay,Store options and what they entail (number of products; manager tools),"Hey there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting out on Ebay in the next week and the idea of a store seems intriguing. I've done my research and it seems that having lots of products is the way to go, but I only have 1 - t-shirts. I have 1 designed t-shirt available in 3 different colours; an original, branded product (I'm starting small, about a 2,500 euro investment). I'm asking a question I probably know the answer, but is this enough to warrant even the cheapest, basic store?

&amp;#x200B;

The other question, and maybe the most important, is the manager tools that interest me. I like the idea of running sales and promotions, and one of the promotions I'd like to have is Buy One, Get 20 Percent Off. Are specific promotions like this possible, and if so, are they available with every store, or the higher-priced ones? Hopefully, if I can get a cheap store with all of the manager tools (even if I'm selling only t-shirts), I might go for it if the promotions can drag in customers.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much in advance.

Getting ready to move from Virginia to Oklahoma and trying to figure out what to do with my bins. The problem is that I haven't been motivated to sell much the past six months and my bins have been sitting and collecting dust...wondering if its worth the effort to bring my stuff with me.

Sounds like it will cost me at least $1,000 to arrange a way to transport my bins via uHaul, moving van etc. I feel a bit ridiculous paying this much to bring my bins with me, when I've hardly touched them or listed anything for over 6 months.

Maybe this is a sign that it's time to move on from my reselling days? 

Has anyone else made a cross country move with inventory in tow? If so, was it worth the expense/effort involved to do so?

I messaged them two days ago asking for an update, No response. I messaged them again yesterday, offering to reimburse them to ship it back to me, No response.

Ebay,Is this legal? (Australia),"EDIT: Managed to get a refund, seller didn't seem to understand what I was saying and kept saying ""will check dear"" after every bloody message until I requested the refund, even when I kept saying the misleading stuff is illegal in Australia. Seller also hid their feedback after the ordeal but before so I took a look and found 13 other negative responses, similar experiences to what I had. Seller drop shipping from China but listings stating they're located in Australia and providing false tracking numbers.

  
So I ordered something from ebay (gba sp shell for a repair) and was given a tracking number on the 13th of january for aus post. Tracking never updated and only said that the shipping information was received from aus post. Ring them and they say they'll investigate. Fast forward to a week later and I ring again as I haven't received updates in the time frame they gave me and this rep said the tracking indicates they haven't received the package and advises I contact the seller. I'm currently awaiting a response from the seller BUT after I responded, I noticed that the seller changed the listing from an Australian one (I always have urgent stuff as Australia only, like this one specifically so it arrives quickly). I was given an estimated shipping time of 1/01-24/01. While typing this, I found another page with a new delivery estimate for February and the actual listing estimates it for March.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, what I want to know is: is it illegal to falsify the item location as it deceives the customer/buyer and also provide false tracking details?
