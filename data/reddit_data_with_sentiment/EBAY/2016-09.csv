Ebay,Clothing sellers how do you handle returns?,"I'm pretty new to selling clothing on eBay. Before I sold mostly cosmetics and have been dipping my toe into the world of apparel sales over the past month.

So far several buyer have opened ""items not as described"" return cases because the item is to big/small thus not giving me the option to deny the return. My options are to pay return shipping with full refund or let them keep the item and still refund them. How do you sellers handle this?

Ebay,Active Content Ban means no video. Unless it's HTML5. Here's how to do that.,"Hi Everyone, this community has been pretty great and yesterday I was faced with an issue. I couldn't post an item due to a youtube iframe being embedded. It was absolutely necessary. eBay did suggest using the html5 &lt;video&gt; tag but really did NOT explain anything other than that. 

Here's my take on it:
    
    &lt;video controls="""" autoplay muted&gt; 
        &lt;source src=""SOURCEURL"" type=""video/mp4""&gt;
    &lt;/video&gt;
To embed a google drive video, publicly share the video and then make the source as follows:

If you have any suggestions for other video hosting options, or any relevant info please comment it here and I will update the main post to make this a little more comprehensive! A little note on the code above: If you want it to NOT autoplay, just take that word out. Same with muted.

Ebay,"Seller store location, item location, and actual address on item received all different?","Back on August 14 I purchased something from a seller. The item said it was located in Portland, OR. I purchased based on that fact, as pretty much every other seller selling this item was in China. 

The seller messaged me the next day on the 15th saying the item won't be delivered until the 20th of September.  I immediately checked their store which said they were located in the United Kingdom. I asked why it would take that long, as the item said it was coming from Portland and their store says UK. They said it was a ""manufacturer delay"" but it would be shipped from Portland.

Fast forward to August 17th and I am notified my item has shipped. The service is listed as ""UPS Ground"" and my tracking number starts with LT and ends in CN. I have worked USPS and UPS shipping for a small business before and immediately knew my item was not only not coming by UPS but was being sent from China. I figured that the seller just put the tracking number he was given from the ""manufacturer"" so I would be able to see about the time it would get to him and then forwarded to me.

It went from Shanghai to New York in about 10 days. I first thought, it's weird it went to NY and not California which is closer to Portland? However I have seen packages go literally around the world before getting to where they need to go so I just figured that was the route.

Then, I get a notification on August 31 that the item was in Nashville (I live in Tennessee). That is when I knew the seller was in China all along. I got my package today. It is in fact from China, shipped by China Post. 

I know that you can report sellers for incorrect item location, but this is such a confusing situation I don't know where to begin to report the seller. The item page is still available with the same item number but the total price has changed. There's also a notification across the top of the page saying ""The listing below has been updated by the seller, but you can see the item you purchased."" The description says nothing about coming from China, just that they deliver to the ""lower 48 only"" and it can take up to 3-10 business days.

This is the first time I've come across this and really the first time I've had a really bad eBay experience, so hopefully someone can help. Thanks in advance!",9,2,2016-09-02,EBAY,0.051934923976659775,0.911217987537384,0.03684712573885918

So this goes to show that we are indeed dealing with a bug of some kind

-------------
 I don't have any warnings or negative feedback, I'm not banned or suspended and the more I read about the issue the more I realize how hopeless it is.
I can't and don't want to call ebay nor do I want them calling me, I don't want to talk to customer support as I feel uncomfortable doing so with a foreign country because I'm afraid I might get charged long distance even if they call me, I don't know, I've heard of stuff like that happening.

However from what I keep reading even calling ebay doesn't resolve the issue, accounts just stay stuck on this message unable to purchase anything for months on end.

My paypal and ebay accounts are both just fine, there's no reason for this to have happened whatsoever yet it happened out of the blue, just like that and there's no solution in sight.

When I try to buy something all I get is a page that says

""Something went wrong. Please try to check out again.""

Ebay,"Seller cancels with no explanation, never contacts me about it, then makes me look like a jerk on my feedback page. Wait, what?","So I make the opening bid on a like $5 item from [SELLER]. Several days later I win the auction for $0.99 + s/h. I pay right away, make a mental note that I'll get a package soon, and push it to the back of my mind.

Five days later I get a message from eBay informing me that [SELLER] canceled my order (out of stock or other reason) and issued a full refund. No message or anything from [SELLER]. 

Unexpected, but no big deal. I got the refund before I even knew it was canceled, which, I mean, I'm no worse off than I was last week. So with that, I consider the matter settled, and I promptly forget about it.

Until a few days later...

Open up eBay. Receive new positive feedback. Oh, it's from [SELLER]. It says, and I quote,

&gt;&gt; Bad buyer do not sell too

I... u wot m8?

Check my messages; nothing from [SELLER]. Double-check auction listing for special ""terms and conditions"" I may have overlooked... nothing. I send a (genuinely) polite message to [SELLER] explaining my confusion and asking if I've done wrong by them in some way. 

Several days pass. To this day, not a single peep from [SELLER]. You know, aside from unilaterally canceling my order and gaslighting me over it on my feedback page, I mean.

So is there anything I can do about that feedback? It's not that big of a deal in any realistic sense, but it's just the principle of the thing that I can't let go. Like, if I was *anything* less than *literally 100% blameless* here, I'd be able to accept it and move on. But this is too absurd. I genuinely don't care that the sale got canceled, I just don't deserve crappy feedback for it, you know?

**Update:** I'm pretty sure I found the smoking gun. I had researched this person before posting to see if I could find more info, but I came up empty because it's a very common word. Just noticed I missed the little ""changed user ID"" icon. Checked it, googled old name, bingo! Found almost 100 community posts. (It didn't occur to me to check the forum because I've never used it, I forgot it exists, and it doesn't help that there's no direct link on profile pages.) So anyway, right in their most recent posts, I see this (reworded so nobody is identified):

&gt;&gt; So now I'm opening random cases and doing crap purely to upset people. My intention is to get as many people to quit eBay as possible. I tried doing this by the book and being a good seller, but people have scammed me and eBay won't even hear my side of the story. So they're gonna get all the BS I can dish out.

I'd say I finally have my answer. It was just so weird because believe it or not, this is actually my very first negative feedback experience on eBay, and I always figured my first time would be some sort of ""we'll just agree to disagree"" kind of thing where the other person at least has a point.

What gets me is that this person has more positive feedback in their 6-month history than I do in my 14 years! Granted I only sell a few items a month, but still. This actually seems like a completely reasonable person up until about a month ago. Weird.

**Long story short, thank you very much to everybody who suggested I call up eBay and have them remove the crap feedback.** Even after looking all through their help and resolution center stuff, I did not realize calling them up was even a possibility. That was the first time I've used a ""help"" feature on something since the nineties. It was an excellent reminder about how garbage that kind of stuff is.

Ebay,Info needed on a sold item,"Hi there

Ok so some months ago my partner and I brought a buggy set and iso fix for our new in bound baby that was due. 

After the baby came and using the car we have and car seat we decided we didn't need the Iso fix,  so put it up on eBay to sell and try recoup some money we paid for it as it was past the return period to the manufacture. 

It was unused and in the box,  put it on eBay and sold it. I myself checked that everything was inside the box and took it to the post office and sent it off. 

Over 2 months later we have now received a email from the person whom brought it claiming it has 2 cracks in it and want their money back. 

Now let me reiterate this ISOFIX was brand new and in perfect condition when I sent it,  so how on earth can this buyer now try claim 2 months later that it's broken and they want their money back. 

Please can any one advise me on this?

Ebay,Refusing Delivery,"I purchased a used electronic item, that has a no return policy, 3 weeks ago and had an estimated delivery for 2-3 days after the purchase date. The seller is located 30 minutes away from where I am. The item did not show as shipped on eBay, nor did the seller update me with the tracking number. I messaged the seller after the estimated delivery day and asked if I could get more info as to where the item was and if I could get the tracking number. After four days the seller responded back with an excuse saying that the item was sent back to him and that he had gone ahead and re-sent the item. Again he provided me with no tracking number and did not update the ebay page. I then messaged him the same day that he told me this if I could get the tracking number. He did not respond. 

After another week I escalated the situation through eBay and asked for my money back. The seller responded the next day, by sending the item and finally updating the eBay page with the tracking number saying that the item again was sent back, but he had sent it. 

I've never had any problems getting any item delivered through my many other purchases through eBay. My address is verified so this shouldn't be a problem.

Ebay,Any experiences with USPS Dead Mail/Recovery center?,"So a lawn mower part I mailed out on the 25th got a case opened on ebay against me. The tracking information said it departed my post office and was sent to the dead mail/ mail recovery center. Never having this issue with many transactions prior I am little confused how to proceed. I called the USPS service line and they told the package was scanned at a post office in Maryland (several states away where the package is supposed to go) and from there was sent to the mail recovery center. 

With it being labor day weekend I know it will be till at least Tuesday till I can sort it out. The Ebay case requires my action by by the 7th. My questions are the following

1.What is the recovery process like after I open an online case with USPS?

2.How long does it take for them to get it sorted in your experience? Online it says up to 60 days.

3. When filling out the USPS case it wants me to ask if I should have it sent to the Adressee or myself. Would the best course of action just be to cancel the order on ebay and have the USPS send it back to me if they recover it.

4. If I do cancel the order with the buyer and refund, am I liable to receive negative feedback?

Ebay,"Buyer is claiming Ebay won't let her send a picture of a supposedly damaged item, is there any truth to this?","I got a message today from someone saying that the glasses case I sold them arrived today in dented condition, and they specifically said they believe my packing was to blame (item was inside a padded bubble mailer.) I told them that I've shipped over a hundred different items in BMs and have never had an issue, and that if she sent me a picture of both the damaged item, and the mailer (should she happen to have it) that I could offer a partial refund. 

So several hours later, she sends me a message saying that when she tries to upload the picture, ebay says she can't send it. I've sent pics to sellers before (when I was a buyer and item showed up with a piece missing) so I know it's possible to send pictures. I'm just double checking that maybe I have an increased privacy setting that could forbid me from getting pictures - before I write her off as a scammer.

Also, I did check her feedback and the transaction immediately prior says ""issue w/ shipping"" so I am wondering if this person has discovered that she can scam sellers. She hasn't threatened me with bad feedback, and my most recent message to her was asking whether or not she had talked to USPS about the damage, because again, a glasses case should have been remotely safe inside a padded bubble mailer.",17,4,2016-09-04,EBAY,0.07289766520261765,0.8972312808036804,0.029871094971895218

Ebay,First time selling and its a car. I'm wondering if I've got my bases covered...,"I really hope this is an ok question to ask here.

I have a car thats worth about 13K-17k and I've been having trouble selling it. The issue is, I have to sell it before my SO and I move which is very soon. Ive tried every free avenue for selling it  (Facebook, CL in mine and neighboring cities, classic car dealers and classic car forums...) I wanted to avoid selling on Ebay only because its foreign land to me and since this would be a large transaction, it kinda scared me to have to do it. Well now its coming down to the wire and on top of nothing else working out for me, I got a offer emailed to me from Ebay saying that if I sell my car through them they'll waive the fee as long as I use it within a week of receiving it.

Being the frugal freak I am, I decided why the heck not and typed up an ad. I chose to do an auction style ad and I put a reserve price on it (which I'm starting to now learn may have been a mistake). I chose a 3 day auction and asked for a $500 deposit within 24hrs of the winning bid and the balance within 3 days. I researched around to see what type of fine print other sellers put on their ads and then added my version of it to mine to hopefully help in protecting me from buyers who aren't serious or who want to back out last minute. 

Basically saying stuff like: 

* If you bid then you're 100% happy with the condition of the vehicle and committing to buy. 
* I'm not responsible for your interpretation of what the condition of the car is. 
* No warranty.
* I'm not responsible for any repairs after you buy.

etc etc, basically those things but not in those words. Now I noticed I had a lot of bidders at first but then on the second day it's like crickets chirping. I still have views and watchers but apparently that can sometimes not be a reliable indicator for bids. I started to get nervous and then lowered the reserve price down to the highest bid amount and still nothing. My questions are:

Did putting a reserve on the ad mess up my chances of selling it at the value price? Should I add a ""Buy it Now"" option or is it even possible now? What suggestions do you have for other ways that I can protect myself during this process? Thanks in advance :)",6,2,2016-09-04,EBAY,0.028096171095967293,0.9216268658638,0.0502769760787487

Ebay,"Buyer Leaves Neutral Feedback for ""Slow Shipping"". Question","Hello all, I am a feedback whore and I have 100% feedback and strive to resolve any issues that come my way and so I am a little disappointed at this neutral feedback I received today that states the following ""Slow shipping. Would not buy from again"". I'm looking at the history of the order and the buyer paid on 7/20/16, I shipped the item out that same day. The tracking first updated on 7/22/16 and was in New Jersey, when the buyer is in Nebraska (and I'm shipping from NC). The package then heads back south to Virginia, and then goes to Nebraska. I'm guessing USPS screwed up. Anyhow, the buyer received the package exactly a week later on 7/27/16. I politely asked the buyer to consider revising the feedback and told him precisely everything I've stated so far. If he doesn't respond, do you guys think I could go to eBay and ask them to remove it since it still was delivered in a timely manner? I am looking at the same listing that he purchased and the max delivery time is 8 days so I think I'm in the clear on this one. What do you guys think? I haven't had great experiences with eBay and seller support, I feel like they are on the buyers side most of the time. Amazon is a godsend in this regard.

Edit: I got a response from the buyer. Here's what he said (sigh):

""I left a neutral feedback because it took a week to get the package. I thought that was excessive. I've ordered numerous times from Nashville and always received them in 2 days with 1st class mail. Whether it was the post office fault or not, 7 days is unacceptable for me. A neutral feedback does not harm your rating and they arrived in good working condition. I will just do my business elsewhere. Thanks.""",16,8,2016-09-05,EBAY,0.032949600368738174,0.9211560487747192,0.045894354581832886

Does it even work like that? I am not stupid and will make sure everything goes through ebay/paypal - I'm just not sure if there needs to be an official return request made.

* Email address
* IP address (no problem, since I'm tethered through my smartphone and Sprint changes my IP every so often.)
* Hard drive &amp; NIC card MAC address (this computer's new as of May 2015)

From what I gather you are supposed to stick within the 30-day rule for when the listing ends to the time the item ships. While I understand that, I've seen sold items as presales 6-months out or more. Is this common practice or will your listing get pulled?

One item I have will be released in Jan or Feb, so I wanted to list it around the holidays for obvious reasons. I've only seen one sold at all in a presale within the last 60 days, and that was months ago.

For the payment you can send paypal payment request(invoice) to my paypal email which i have sent to you before(email omitted),or you can send your paypal email through ebay/invoice so that i can make payment into your paypal account today,Thank you.

Between the broken english, the new account, and the requests to invoice through directly through paypal has me worried. Am I being paranoid or should I avoid this buyer? Also, what fees (in any) do I have to pay if I do cancel it and can i get them refunded?

&gt; * New other: A new, unused item with absolutely no signs of wear. The item may be missing the original packaging, or in the original packaging but not sealed. The item may be a factory second or a new, unused item with defects. See the seller’s listing for full details and description of any imperfections.

The buyer submitted a return request for it because they said it ""wasn't new, wasn't unopened"", ""doesn't match description or photos"", ""missing protective cover"" and has ""signs of being installed"". As I said before, it's under ""New other"", not ""New"", and I never opened the GPU packaging seal; if anyone's responsible for defects it would be the manufacturer.

I had not inspected the graphics card firsthand for defects, lest it would be considered opened and I could void its warranty. I even talked about how the box was missing objects like a drivers CD and manual. I also provided pictures of the box open and closed in my listing to prove that it was not the box that was unopened, but it was the graphics card's large foil packaging that was unopened.

They've also tried to imply I haven't been willing to help, but in conversation with them, I've twice made it clear that there should be a free warranty on the GPU that they can register to get a free full replacement for the device. They haven't responded since, but the return request still remains.

**TL;DR**

I made sure the listing was under ""No returns"", but I've still received this return request, so I don't know what this means for me. Even though I have proof of my claims and followed Ebay's rules appropriately, I don't know who to talk to or how to defend my case when the only options it shows are [these](http://imgur.com/a/FnUki). The Paypal funds I received are on hold now. How can I get this resolved?

Am I somehow legally obligated to give them a return/partially refund them, even though I've met all of the recommended criteria to avoid such an outcome? Does ""No returns"" mean absolutely nothing, that I'll be forced to comply? Or should I just wait for the deadline to end, and the dispute will just disappear?",13,2,2016-09-07,EBAY,0.18873248994350433,0.7870087027549744,0.024258797988295555

Ebay,PayPal/eBay holding funds,"So I was bored this morning and logged into PayPal through the iPhone app. (I usually use the desktop website on my pc.). I noticed it showed a payment had been put on hold.... Since August 11th.  Mind you all, I log in to PayPal on my computer sometimes several times a day and this now pending payment had never shown up on the main summary page.  

The payment in question was a GSP sale.  The buyer had opened a case on August 10, saying they received an empty box.  I called eBay and they immediately closed the case in my favor and released my funds that had been put on hold. However, apparently, the next day they put the money back on hold.  eBay never contacted me, PayPal never alerted me.  I had several hundred dollars just missing with no action by either company.  I get lots of transactions in and out and never noticed the money went back out. (My fault). 

I called PayPal who conferenced called eBay and they released my funds back to me.  Neither had an explanation of why the funds were put back on hold or why I wasn't contacted or if the funds would have ever been released back to me. PayPal blamed eBay, eBay said sometimes funds can take 48 hours to be release.  Wtf? She didn't even answer the question I asked her.  I just wanted my money back at this point, I didn't have time for BS explanations so I didn't question further.

Ebay,I'm within my rights to return and get a refund right?,"Just looking for some reassurance (a TL;DR at the bottom if you cba with the main bit)

I bought some trainers on August 16th, they were sold as a size 10 and brand new, with no indication they were anything but genuine. I received them, for anyone familiar with Nike shoe boxes, the size in big numbers is the US Size with the UK Size in smaller font, so these were actually a size 9, no good for me. I thought 'no biggie, I'll sell them on as a size 9, they look alright' so i gave feedback and sold them on.
The guy i sell them to instantly raises a return request for them not being authentic, and sends pictures of badly placed lace holes, poor gluing and says the barcodes on the box are for different type of trainer. I ask the person I bought them off if she has proof of purchase, she says she bought them from a friend as their son didn't want them. Red Flag. So i accept the return, get them back and give a refund. 

I've now opened a return with the original seller and she appears to be somewhat vexed that i am trying to return them, and has offered a 60% refund which will still leave her out of pocket apparently. She now says that she will leave it for ebay to get involved.

So my argument is that they are the wrong size as what was listed, and are fake. Her argument is that I've taken too long to do this, have already left her feedback (just the word 'awesome' which i leave on everything) and that I should have raised this when I first received them.  

This is 23 days after purchase, should have said that originally.

Any ideas what will ebay decide?

Ebay,[Discussion]Ebay Coupons WTFFFF,"Ok lets back track a little, i sold my phone on ebay a few weeks ago and Ebay had this guaranteed price thing so even if the bidding didn't get to their guaranteed price they would refund me the difference in a coupon so i agreed.

""Hi Mr. _____!

When your Nexus 6P A1 (Latest Model) - 64GB - Frost (Unlocked) Smartphone WITH ACCESSORIES sold on eBay, it didn't reach our guaranteed price of $414.00. To make things right, we've covered the rest with a coupon code. Just enter the following code at checkout:

So i go to use the coupon but the total was only 19.99 i was gonna use the rest of the money later anyway, 19.99 should rightfully come off the coupon but when i went to make another purchase the next day the coupon gave me an error. I called ebay and what they basically told me is that i can only use the coupon once regardless of the amount that was left on it WTFFFFF. Anyway the guy said as  courtesy i will submit a request for you to receive another coupon via email within the next 2-3 hours. that was 24 hours ago and when i called again the rep told me there was no request sent in for the rest of the money.  

I wouldnt even fight this if it said in the email that i could only use it once but it didn't and im not gonna lose out on almost 58 dollars  for ebays B.S policy about coupons.

Ebay,Likely hood I lose this case? Plus just general venting,"So I sold my iPhone 6 plus on ebay, it is a unlocked iPhone that I previously used on T-Mobile.  While I was cleaning it off to take pictures for the posting I noticed a small scratch on the screen so I of course put that on the listing but it was the only scratch on the phone.  

A Buyer purchases my phone and I ship it on its merry way... I get a message the day he receives it telling me that the phone is not unlocked.  He goes on to say that he took it to his cell provider and they could not activate it. I ask what provider he has, because my immediate thought is that if its Verizon or Sprint maybe it won't work? However he replies ""US Cellular"".  I simply go to their website, go to FAQs, go to iphone and read item 9.

**Can I use an iPhone from another wireless carrier on the U.S. Cellular network?
No, these devices are incompatible with the U.S. Cellular network. However, you can trade-in your existing iPhone for an iPhone that is compatible with the U.S. Cellular network. See your nearest U.S. Cellular store for trade-in program details.**

So obviously the fact that this Buyer did not know he was unable to use my phone with his provider is not my issue.  But today I noticed that he request a return and states that there are multiple scratches on my device (which I promise there was not) as well as my phone is not unlocked.  I have proof of the phone being unlocked and the pictures on the listing do not show that many shots of the screen but the buyer never once mentioned scratches until he is requesting a return.  He also does not mention anywhere that US Cellular will not use iphones from other carriers in his request. 

I really don't want to accept the return, pay for it to be shipped back, then lose money now that the new iPhone is available for pre-order not to mention that my phone screen looks damaged now that I see pics from the seller.  I'm going to fight this as hard as I can, as I've sold many electronics with no issue, but I have a good feeling I will still lose.  Thoughts? Appreciate the ability to at least vent about this!

EDIT: Buyer is also mentioning a 250 dollar cost to unlock the phone.  Again the phone is already unlocked, so I'm not sure where or who he is getting that number from.

Ebay,"Item hasn't arrived, seller has lots of feedback lately with ""did not send"" issues","Back on the 25th of August I ordered a 1000 watt inverter from a seller supposedly based in Australia. It was supposed to have been delivered between Monday, Aug 29, 2016 - Monday, Sep 5, 2016. I needed it to send overseas for a small project to help bring electricity to a small village in a third world country. The date I needed it for was today. Needless to say, it has not arrived.

Back on September 2nd I contacted the seller and asked why it wasn't marked as dispatched. Their reply was:

We are sorry for the delay dispatch. We did send the item to post office, but it was sent back due to some reasons. And we will arrange a replacement to you. could you please tell us if you still need it? if not, we will issue a refund for you. 

So I replied that I needed it URGENTLY and asked for it to be re-sent, thinking that they were posting it from within Australia and that they would just re-send my item. On last Tuesday I finally get a message asking me to be patient as they were sending it from their warehouse.

Now looking at their recent feedback there has been heaps of negative feedback over the last month reporting items never received. It is also apparent the seller is sending items from China, Not Australia as stated. If I had known this item was being sent from China I would have never ordered it because I know the delivery times take far longer than from Australia where I live.

The seller is refusing to refund my money saying I requested a re-delivery. The item is now useless to me, as it could not be dispatched with my team to provide power to that village (we had to buy one in a shop at 3 times the price).

Ebay,Buyer threatens slander if I don't replace damaged item.,"This past week I sent out a set of (common) collectible boxed toys (I actually sent out 30+ sets of this same set, all packaged the same) and received a negative feedback regarding how awful my selling and shipping practices are. My feedback is very good and 1 negative doesn't even change my %, but it got to me anyway. I am awesome at taking care of my customers and will bend over backwards to make them happy, but the abrasiveness of this guys language and the fact he left the feedback without giving me a chance to make it right, it just irked me, But I've  dealt with this kind of junk enough to let it roll. He then sent a message demanding replacements, saying the items showed up with holes in the boxes (which tells me that it was at least partly a USPS handling problem as I only sell brand new and ship packed in USPS branded boxes) and how ridiculous it is that I would ship him these in this condition. At this point I am not going out of my way for him since I know the feedback will stick and he is quite the dick. I ask him to open a return case and I can get him a refund or replacement. It takes him 24 hours to open the case and in that time I have sold the last 3 sets of these in stock, so a replacement is off the table. I let him know I was so sorry, am sold out and I am happy to accept the return for a full refund. He proceeds to let me know he will destroy me on social media and will not rest until the entire toy community hears of what an awful business I run.


Jesus Christ. Who in the world has the time and energy to commit to such brooding and scheming? 

I respond again with the options (keep or return for full refund) and he tells me I need to make this right and get him replacements or he will go through with his ""slanderous"" intentions.

I had decided to let it go and move on until he wrote the word slander. Now I feel like he has gone too far and I should do something. 


TL;DR- buyer is a dick about item arriving  damaged, leaves neg and threatens slander.

Ebay,ebay checkout problem,"I recently had an odd ebay checkout problem I thought I would run by you all.

Preface this by saying that I've been buying and selling daily on ebay since 2000, so I have a great understanding of how things normally work.

I tried to buy an item being sold for $1200 plus $80 shipping. This was a fixed priced listing. Clicking ""buy it now"" took me directly to checkout, so the seller had it listed as ""immediate payment required"". 

Each time I tried to checkout, the system would try to process my credit card payment for a few seconds, then give me an error. ""This payment option is not available. Here are your options. Select a different payment method. Contact paypal customer service to resolve this issue.""

I tried putting my credit card number directly into the ebay checkout system. I tried two different credit cards, both of which I've used before on ebay and both of which had funds available.

I also tried the paypal option on the ebay checkout page...and since I had a small amount of funds sitting in paypal, this meant that it combined the paypal balance with my credit card. And I tried it this way, again using two different credit cards, neither way would work. 

During this time I check my credit card accounts online, and one of them calls me because my card was flagged for possible fraud. Turns out that each attempt I made to checkout DID ping my card for the correct amount. Then instantly the charge was refunded back onto my card account.  So on each card I had 2 or 3 charges for $1140-1280, each with an instant credit just under it. So I judged that my cards were not the problem, and the one card had it's fraud hold lifted by the bank.

So I have ebay CS call me. Phone rings, I pick up, nothing on the other line, eventually the system puts me back on hold and after a few minutes I hang up and go to the computer to have ebay CS call me again. Later they do, and I talk to a clueless foreigner. She says they have been having some payment processing problems recently. She thinks there is a ""glitch"" in the system due to my paypal account being linked to my ebay account, and she has me try several methods/locations to unlink my paypal account, then try the purchase again. This simply has the affect of making me log in to paypal again during checkout, but does nothing to resolve the checkout issue. At one point she asks me to set up automatic payments for my ebay seller account, which I refused to do. After a while, she says we've exhausted the ""ebay procedures"" and suggests that I talk to paypal.

Paypal gives me a knowledgeable US lady who says that though there have been some technical issues recently, there have been none relating to this. I tell her about what me and the ebay lady went through and she says none of that has anything to do with the problem at all. She suspects that the ""risk department"" may be declining the transaction due to the high value. She comes back on the line and says they've ""made some adjustments"" and that I should try checkout again. Doesn't work. Repeat this process 3 times. Still won't work. She says it doesn't look like paypal is interfering with the checkout, because if it were, the charges would never even be passed to my credit cards at all, the process would be halted inside paypal itself. She ""creates a ticket"" and says they will continue to investigate and will contact me when they've figured out a workaround.

She suggests in the meantime that I try to get the seller to sell me the item directly, and that I then try to pay for the item via paypal, but outside of ebay. I laugh and tell her that ebay would crucify me if I tried that, the only way to contact the seller is via ebay messaging which is monitored and words such as ""paypal invoice"" or email addresses will flag the conversation immediately, and that I am not looking to forfeit my ebay seller account over this. She asks why I don't just buy the item, then contact the seller off of ebay once I get access to their email, and ask for a direct paypal purchase, then manually go back into ebay and ""mark as payment sent"". I have to explain to her about ebay ""immediate payment required"" and then she finally understands why my hands are tied. 

So the paypal rep says she will send the seller a message directly to their email account for me explaining the issue and asking the seller to contact me. I finally get into contact with the seller directly, he says I can try to send him paypal directly for the purchase. I go to paypal and the payment goes through immediately without issue. So the checkout issue had to be on ebay's side. 

Not surprisingly, no one from paypal or ebay has ever contacted me and I guess as far as they know I am still trying to complete ebay checkout.",0,4,2016-09-10,EBAY,0.07271114736795425,0.8860530853271484,0.04123579803854227

Ebay,"Ebay Buyer claims item not as described, wants partial refund, case already closed without response from me... HELP!","I need some help.

I recently sold a PS2 harddrive on ebay described as Used, but the buyer opened up a case against me saying ""item not as described"" and wants a partial refund.

The case was closed without giving me a chance to respond at all, nor did I receive any notifications about it through email or my eBay phone app. ( Case was opened on 9/9/16, closed 9/9/16) 

He said that the item has been used before - which is false, I was never able to use the hard drive because it required another adapter piece, which I have never owned. It was never plugged in or powered on.

I can't respond to the case at all except for giving him a FULL REFUND even though he requested a partial refund in the case message.

He says he uploaded pictures of the problem but I do not see any pictures upload.

What should I do? Ebay sent me a message saying I need to pay for return shipping, but there is no way for me to do this. It only lets me give him a full refund. They expect me to pay for the return shipping, and for a full refund? The item is worth $33 and the shipping is $7-$8.

This hasn't even been escalated to Paypal yet. It only shows up on eBay. 

I have sent the buyer a message trying to get some clarity on the situation. I asked him if he would like a partial or full refund, because if it is a partial refund, I will be escalating this further with eBay, because he made a mistake in the case opening. 

I also asked him for the pictures of the hard drive. I'll know if it's the right one because I marked it specifically in a hidden spot with a sharpie marker.

I recently sold a watch to a guy who claimed that it arrived broken. He sent a picture of the watch with one of the function pushers fallen off. I apologized assuming something happened in shipping and accepted a return. 

He sent me a package containing a broken watch that was NOT  the one I sent him..the serial numbers don't match and this one was all scratched up. I called ebay, they say nothing they can do, I can try to ""appeal"" only after giving his money back.

Ebay said I had to refund by Aug 30. I let the clock run out, and they have still yet to ""force"" a refund. The $$ is still in my paypal. Can anyone tell me whats going on? Does he need to escalate it manually or something? How long will the case be in this ""limbo"" before ebay steps in, and do I have any way to get it dropped if nothing happens?

but then i click the listing and the prices change.  I still see 6.51 CAD as the item price but the shipping cost now shows as 20.20 CAD and no its not because of the ripoff import charges...that shows up on its own as 0.00 because the item price is below 20 i believe.

Choose return item and it made a case. Took photos measuring the suit and commenting it doesn’t match the item listing description for measurements.

He doesn’t mention anything about the incorrect sizes of the suits. Do I just call EBay or just wait for the 7 days for EBay to step in.

Look at the time it was delivered. That silicon inturn shorted out the charging port. You made it completely impossible to open with out destroying the screen and L.C.D. not mention all the parts are useless. That is not as described because you knew that it was not repairable.

Ebay,Selling to a first time eBuyer: scam or just a spaz?,"So I'm selling an old 5-era model iPhone that has been water damaged to where it will not power on. I have no use for it, so might as well give it up to a fixer who might. I had it auctioned for a few days, no buyers, lowered the price a tad, and someone hit Buy It Now. Exciting right?

Well I go to look at the seller info, and it's someone with a Zero rating. Turns out it's because they just joined today. I am no newb-discriminater - we all start somewhere - but it seemed a little fishy, cell phones are in black market business, never know what's up.

So I inquire to the buyer, just to confirm they're a real person.

*""Hello, welcome to eBay!*
*I want to confirm that this is the exact address you would like the item to be delivered:*
*(redacted)*
*6929 179th*
*(redacted)*
*Let me know, and I will have it shipped your way tomorrow morning""*

Turns out, as I was typing that message up, they had sent a **cancellation request** just two minutes prior.

Then 3 minutes AFTER my message sent, they respond:

*""Ignore the cancel, 6929, 179th st is the correct address, I appreciate it!""*

Which, by the way, is the original address in question, no correction. So now I'm extra confused. I respond curiously:

*""Okay, was there an issue you had with the item or was it just a mistake?""*

I guess that then miffed them? Because they replied to that:

**""Just cancel it, personal reasons, and im not sure if i can really fix the water damage. Sorry for wasting your time!""**

Did they have some odd intent with their purchase? Not know their way around eBay yet? Were they just real spazzy? Or was I just too irritating with all the questions and they didn't want to do business with me?

I googled first time buyers, and found someone else had a similar situation:

*""I am nervous because this buyer purchased a phone at the buy it now price an has a ""0"" feedback.  He sent an e-check which I am waiting to clear, but has sent me 2 questions as to whether t will work with his service.

Ebay,Buyer wants a retrurn.. now item not coming in the mail..,"Okay so ive been selling video games and such on ebay for a couple of months though, 100% feedback. Just recently I got hit with a ""Not as described"" complaint, even though I listed the item as a used electronic as-is.

So I did just that, issued the return and paid for the return label. The buyer was very happy and issued me positive feedback.. But he went to ship it out, a day later I get a message ""your item has been returned / delivered!"" except, I didnt receive anything. When I look at the tracking #, the package went all around and was returned to sender because of a package mishap.. However, according to ebay the return has been delivered and I have 2 days to do something before ebay issues an automatic refund. 

What should I do??? I don't want to issue a refund without seeing and making sure this person is returning the same item I sent him.

Ebay,"Okay, what the hell is up with PayPal?","I'm having a few issues with PayPal and I'd really appreciate it if someone could give me insight. I have two problems...

- Problem #1: sold some items on eBay between August 30-31. Two game consoles. One was about $100, the other about $200. I sold the $100 console AFTER the $200 console, yet I received the funds from the cheaper console a week ago... I am still waiting on the $200 pending in my PayPal account. Even more strange, on eBay there was no ""Estimated Funds Availability"" for this transaction like there was for the $100 item. It has now been over two weeks and I've yet to get my money. What exactly is going on?

- Problem #2: I have a PayPal credit account with a balance. I paid off about 1/3 of the balance, and then a day later, the available credit matched the amount I had paid. Then, I made a small $25 purchase on eBay, and now for the last 5 days my available credit is listed as ""$0"".

Ebay,Revenge Negative Feedbacks,"**Story:**

I recently purchased a BIN item from a seller, but was later cancelled because it turns out he also had the same item on the auction and decided to just sell the item to the person who won the auction, even though the auction price was less than the BIN. So, I left a negative feedback.

A day later, he purchases the cheapest item that I have up for sale and his messages imply that he probably will leave a negative feedback against me. (I have since added to my blacklist). 

Turns out, he is upset that the feedback I left him is a ""lie"". I told him I would change the feedback, but he says he doesn't want to and keeps ranting about the fact I made a ""lie"". As if people on the internet never lie or people are never misinformed.

Message 2: https://i.gyazo.com/46cbdfd79f95a827984a8cc407b9be62.png

**Thoughts:**

Just want general thoughts on these situations. I've been using eBay for 6 years and this is the first time I've come across a situation like this. Usually, I have been able to resolve issues.

I also want to note that I contacted eBay and they said I can take a strike against my account and just cancel the transaction (which will still allow him to leave a negative feedback), or I can ship him the item with ""benefit of the doubt"" and see what he does. I asked the eBay rep about revenge feedbacks, but they said they couldn't do anything about it (especially if they just leave a negative feedback saying ""seller doesn't communicate""). I'm not sure if that is true or not.


edit: This was the message he sent me after I asked a question about the item he was originally selling (apparently he got mad about it): https://i.gyazo.com/775605d56869bf939aa25eafe9c34430.png",17,6,2016-09-14,EBAY,0.08150380849838257,0.8855868577957153,0.0329093337059021

Ebay,How to protect myself from Bait and Switch scam by a buyer,"Essentially the buyer buys an item from a seller. The buyer also purchases (for almost nothing) the exact same item which is broken. Claims the seller sold a broken item to them, and gets their money back and also gets to keep the working item the seller sold.

In my case, Im ABOUT to send a PS3 to my buyer, in which I received the PayPal payment pending my shipment. My item was listed with a ""No Return Policy"", but apparently Ebay overrides it if the item is proven to be broken (or in this case scammed to be broken by the buyer)

If I take a bunch of photos of my PS3, working and in good condition for my own records BEFORE I ship it with proof of the serial number of the PS3 I sold, can I win a Bait and Switch accusation? Any other advice would be great. 

Im not really sure if my buyer is trying to pull this, I just am skeptical because I know it does happen. Just want to play it safe so I dont sell my PS3 for nothing.

Ebay,Item not as described claim,"We listed a collectible out of print video game on eBay as ""like new"" condition,  my husband is a collector and incredibly picky about these things.   We took high res photos of the front and back of the case as well as the inside of the case.     Buyer was asking questions before we shipped out the items,  wanting to make sure that the item was in great condition.   So we double and triple checked the item prior to shipping it,  looked at it closely for any flaws that we may have missed,  there were none.   Item was well packed and shipped to the buyer with tracking.

Buyer received the item but claims that it is not in good condition.   He sent us a blurry cell phone pic where the item is intact but other than that it's hard to see anything else.  He claims there are some tiny little dents in the packaging.   We asked him if the packaging was damaged in shipping (in which case we'd file with postal insurance) but he says the packaging was fine.  Buyer claims that we damaged the item between taking the photos and putting the item in the packaging.   

I'm not sure what we can do in this case,  eBay seems heavily biased towards ""the customer is always right"".   From what I can tell,  we will be required to pay for the original shipping,  plus shipping the item back.      I've read conflicting reports,  this has not yet been escalated to a claim,  so if we were to just deal with it with the buyer,  if we agree to the refund,  we can wait to receive the item before refunding?   That way we can make sure that we receive the correct (collectible) game back and that it is in the correct condition?   If we wait until it's escalated to a claim,  I think at that point the refund is automatically granted to the buyer and then we have to just deal with appeals?  

Is it reasonable for the customer to be this picky about the quality?  I mean if there are any dents in this game they would be microscopic and unviewable with the naked eye,  we saw NO dents when we shipped this item out.

Ebay,"Seller claims to have combined shipping for multiple orders but did not, Ebay resolved my claim in their favor because they provided the tracking number and confirmed delivery.","**tl;dr**

I made 3 separate orders for 4 items from a seller and made a note if it were easier they could combine shipping. I only received one item, but assumed they did not see my note to combine shipping. After I saw all 4 items were marked as delivered, I contacted the store to ask if there was a issue with fulfillment or shipping and they claim there was not. They ask for a photo of the shipping label i received and not the products delivered. I tell them i discarded the packaging right when i received the item (3 weeks prior to me contacting them)

There is a back and forth, they immediately become aggressive, and made claims of having evidence they refuse to produce. I filed a claim with eBay and ebay ruled in their favor for the first item because the seller produced a tracking number and confirmation of deliver. I have 3 more cases open that I cannot ask eBay to step in until Sept 19th.

What can I do now for the next 3 claims to prove to eBay just because a tracking number and confirmation of delivery can be provided does not mean my order was in the packaged received? 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
**The Full Story:**

I made 3 orders. I made the first order for 1 item before deciding to order 3 more items. My phone was giving me issues combining the orders so i made a note in the following 2 orders (1 order with 1 item, 1 order with 2 items) that if it were more convenient for the seller, they could combine shipping. 

I received the first order alone and did not assume anything was wrong until 2-3 weeks later when i noticed i was receiving notifications to review all 4 items. I contacted the seller to ask if there was an error in fulfillment or possibly shipping and the seller claims no error was made, all 3 orders were fulfilled and all 4 items were packaged together as well as a single shipping label was proof of this. They ask for a photo of the packing slip i had received my single item in 3 weeks prior, and i let them know i discarded it but have the item. Theres a back and forth of messaging before the seller becomes irate they then:

1. Claim to have messaged me prior to fulfilling my order to confirm combining shipping was no problem, then messaged me after fulfilling my order that a combined shipment has been sent out. No such messages were sent and when i asked for them they ignored me 3 times before responding a single tracking number was confirmation enough. (That was not how they originally claimed they confirmed they would be combining shipping)

2. They threatened to review security footage of my order being fulfilled, then claimed they had video proof my order was fulfilled correctly, then threatened to send the footage to eBay. I said that was fine but i would like a link to the footage and requested it clearly show the items being packaged and my information on the packing slip being applied to the shipment because without that it could be any random footage of any order being fulfilled. They have so far  refused to provide any footage to me and as far as i know to ebay.

3. The seller began to demand i describe the packing slip/box i had received my order in 3 weeks prior.  I informed them i was ordering a lot when i originally ordered the items from them so the packaging was either orange or white, they then said I was incorrect because they shipped everything in a box….??? It is possible it was a white box, but could they provide any proof (waiting on that footage). And whatever the packaging was shipped in, it still does not change the fact it only contained the first order.  ON top of that, how does a description of the shipping help them because the only way I could guess correctly was if they sent the orders correctly/i received my orders which I had not. Even if i was lying about the package not containing all 4 items, i would be able to describe the packaging right if i had ever received the one they claim to have sent. 

After I was able to ask for ebay to step in for my original claim, they ruled today in the sellers favor because they provided a tracking number and delivery confirmation. That is fine, i did receive one item from them but I am now concerned for the 2 other orders of 3 items that amounts to just over $30 of product. How can i prove to eBay these items were never sent when the seller is providing shipping information from a single fulfilled order?

Ebay,Who would win this dispute?,"Sold a small vintage glass ashtray for 60 bucks.

Packaged it very carefully, big bubble wrap multiple layers, mini box in a bigger reinforced box no way it would break.

I apologized told him it was insured and asked for pictures of the ashtray, packaging, and broken chunk.

He sends back a photo of the ashtray with a tiny broken piece of the ridge of the base missing, and no broken off pieces.

I compared his photo to my original listing, I took multiple photos from multiple angles very good pictures, I see the exact same damage clearly in my photos even though I never noticed it before, it is really that small.

Ebay,"""What's the lowest price you'll take?""","Hi all,
Perhaps it's just the type of items I sell, but has anyone else noticed a HUGE uptick in the number of potential buyers sending a message that says ""What is the lowest price you will take?"" All of my listings are ""buy it now"" with immediate payment required, no option for ""best offer.""  My prices are very reasonable and despite only having about 100 to 150 items listed at a time, I EASILY get this message 3-4 times a day.

First of all, I am not going to haggle myself down to my lowest possible price lol.  I can't help but wonder though if I would be likely to sell items more quickly if I raised the prices and added a ""best offer"" option just so these people feel like they are saving something.  Almost invariably, however, if I offer the person 5 or 10 bucks off, they never message me back anyway- they are clearly trying to get an already well-priced item for near free.

Anyway, anyone else noticing this?  Thoughts on raising prices and adding a best offer option?  Or should I just keep saying ""Sorry, my buy it now price is the best I can do""",54,14,2016-09-18,EBAY,0.03571990504860878,0.9168234467506409,0.04745672270655632

Ebay,Seller won't refund shipping...,"Hi guys,

Just wanted to get some advice regarding a phone I returned to the seller.

When I received the phone (a Nexus 5), the front camera was missing (and the screen was falling off). 

They had not described either of these things in the original listing.

We set up a return, and they received the phone. However, they are saying the front camera works fine (the one they sent me definitely wasn't; the entire front camera module was missing) and that because of this, they will only refund the item's price and not the shipping I paid.

I did not take any photos/videos of the device when I got it, but even so, shouldn't they refund the entire amount I paid, since they acknowledge the screen was falling off?

Ebay,"Fairly new to ebay, have issue with hateful buyer","Hello, I have been on ebay for years, just started selling a few years ago.  Stopped for a bit, now back to selling.

I sold a pair of pre-owned jeans on ebay last week.  I posted about 8 photos of the jeans showing about every aspect of their wear, and included a brief description that included the brand, size, measurements, etc.  I gave no written description of the condition of the jeans.

Buyer purchased the jeans via auction, paid promptly, I mailed out the next day and left positive feedback for the transaction.  Last night the buyer left me negative feedback calling me a low-life, and advised no one to purchase from me because I was ""untrustworthy"", and that I sold ""damaged"" items without revealing it to you.

She also sent me an e-mail again calling me names, and demanded a full refund of the item.  She said the back of the jeans were coming apart.  Not at all true!  I checked the photos to see what the heck she was talking about and there was a decorative thread that had come loose on the jeans.  I have another pair of the same exact jeans and they have two seams down the back, one is white that is purely decorative.  A stitch had come loose in one spot.  Very easy fix, and was clearly shown in the photos.  I explained as such, she admitted the damage was in the photos, but she can't see very well and relied on the description.  Again, there was nothing disclosed in the description about the wear or condition.

She made threats to me, she apparently knows someone high-up in ebay, blah blah blah.  She has really rattled me and now I really don't want to sell anything else.  I told her I would refund her money, but not the shipping, since the condition is clearly shown in the photos.

Am I in the wrong?  Paypal has put a hold on her funds and the shipping costs as well.  I am willing to resolve this issue, but she is just a nasty, hateful person.

Ebay,Video Game Keyword Ordering in Listing Title,"I'm fairly new to the eBay game and selling video games in general, but I do know that which keywords you use and in what order you use them in your title are important for maximizing relevant views. For those of you that do sell video games I'm interested to know where some of you put the word ""Complete"" or ""CIB"" in your titles? For instance, would you have your titled constructed as:

&amp;nbsp;

Metal Slug Anthology Complete (Sony Playstation 2)

&amp;nbsp;

Or:

&amp;nbsp;

Metal Slug Anthology (Sony Playstation 2) Complete

&amp;nbsp;

Or something else entirely? The general rule of thumb (from what I've read anyway) is to put your most important keywords toward the front, but I feel as though this may not apply for all listings. For example, if you have a long game title, might it be better to put it after the parenthesis so that a buyer does not skim over it? 
And how about for factory sealed titles? I tend to do the following:

Ebay,'Item not as described',"What to do, what to do? 

Sold a pretty expensive item (a computer audio interface). I actually hardly used it but I'm moving country and figured it would lighten my load to sell it. Total price was about £400. 
He received the item and immediately opened a dispute with PayPal claiming the interface doesn't work but would accept a 'partial refund' for the full amount (!???!!). 
I know it worked when I sent it, I even covered myself by shipping with insurance up to £500, which actually cost more than I charged him for the shipping, which I told him.

Lastly in order to receive support for the device, you have to register it with the manufacturer. I had already done so, but contacted them to ask if I could de-register and the new owner could register with full warranty etc. They responded that was fine and I saved the email conversation with the very helpful support staff. 

The buyer is claiming he is unable to register his device and get support with the manufacturer because I am the registered owner, which is simply not true and have the emails to back it up.

Ebay,Need some help with this situation I'm in....,"I edited this, hope this is easier to read. Sorry for the babbling last night, I was frustrated to say the least. This is also my first post on Reddit so please forgive me if I make a mistake (or several). 

Need some help. I'll try to make this as quick as possible. 

Basically, I sell cosmetics online though a couple websites, eBay being one of them. I don't usually use eBay but I chose to list a few items recently for various unrelated reasons. I usually sell brand new items (yuck, used cosmetics!) but I do have a couple things that aren't brand new; in this situation,  I listed one of the items which was a 
Limited edition MAC pigments that is worth quite a bit of money and is extremely popular so therefor different amounts are sold online all the time, new or used, they are still very popular. This particular shade was one that gets sold in 1/8 tsp samples- and I've seen them go for as much as $60 (just for a little scoop of this pigment.... read: Eyeshadow). 

Anyway, The jar I had was 3/4 full- I dumped a portion of it into another jar after I bought it and it has been sitting untouched in my vanity ever since which, of course,  I explained thoroughly in my listing. 

I started the auction low &amp; put the Buy It Now at $79. I included photos of the jar and a detailed description of its contents. It was bought immediately. The buyer requested that I ship it ASAP (because they ""needed it for a work event"") so  I rushed to the post office that day and paid for overnight shipping- even though the listing said 2-3 days. 

So, A few days later, I get a nasty email from the buyer that said ""what's this?! I bought a product that was supposed to be BRAND NEW IN BOX!"". I replied and told them that the ad had clearly said it was used. He was going on and on about how it was supposed to be a gift for his sister and he couldn't give her that, etc. I'm not sure if that's relevant but I did think it was odd that his stories weren't matching up. (Does that indictate that he is a scammer or just pissed off?) 

The guy sent me a picture of the jar which- surprise surprise- it is now much different then what I had shipped him. It now looks to be about 10% full. The guy opened a claim with PayPal initially stating it was not as described- but once I pointed out that it stated this in the ad, he is saying that the problem is not that it's used but that it's not 3/4 full. 

He has been sending me dozens of nasty emails all in broken English. I have explained to him that normally I wouldn't have a problem accepting a return but since there is significantly less in the jar, I can't take it back, because I have no idea what I would be getting back in return.

Needless to say, he hasn't been cooperative or even civil at all. I don't know how to handle this. I'm aware that PayPal will probably side with him but so far i haven't gotten an answer from them. For now, they have frozen the funds in my Account. 

I need someone's opinion on this. I have sold hundreds of items online and have excellent feedback for every single sale I've done and I would NEVER rip someone off or scam anyone. My reputation is worth a lot more then this measly $80. But I don't know what to do in this situation. I'm pretty sure I need to just Chalk it up as lesson learned and forget it....but that obviously sucks and it's just plain wrong!

 Should I try to dispute it? Do I even have a chance to win this? As cheesy as this may sound, it's already a lose
Lose for me. I've never had an unhappy customer and having this guy harass me constantly is so not worth it. 


I should also note, that he left a horrid rating on my

I would like to sell something that I doubt I'll be able to sell for more than $1. However, it's heavy, so I calculate the shipping will be about $45. Does this mean that eBay's fee to sell this item will be $4.92, i.e., I should expect to make a profit of negative $3.92 for selling this item on eBay? And if the buyer decides to use PayPal, I can expect my ""profits"" to be even less?

Am I reading that correctly?

Ebay,"Looking for advice as a new Ebay seller, issue with Buyer","I'm pretty bummed out right now :( Paypal screwed me over in the past (nearly 7 years ago) and I never used them until recently since I started selling items on Ebay. I gave them a 2nd chance, but now they are screwing me again.

I sold a very expensive sink on ebay, sold for about $700+. The item was brand new in the box, never touched or opened! On the Ebay listing I specified I did not do refunds as I don't really want to mess around with that. I sell my items typically 20% cheaper than other listings, so I felt the no refunds aspect is justified for the price reduction, imo.

Anyhow 5 weeks later, the guy I sold it to claims it was already used, and damaged. He also says it looks like someone tried to cover up the damage. This is not possible at all since I never opened the brand new item. To me it seems very likely he messed up trying to install the unit and is now pointing fingers at me. I declined the refund through ebay but now he opened a claim with Paypal. And Paypal takes his side a day later. They say he has to ship the item back and they will auto bill be $700+!

The dispute is closed and shut... What am I to do? This isn't right, especially if he's the one who damaged the item and now I have to pay for it?!

**Edit: The first time Paypal screwed me - I completed some Health Information Technology program back in 2009. There was a certification test you can take for it, so I bought a study guide online for that specific test. It was a total scam. The seller took my money and never sent me anything what-so-ever. Everytime I'd call or email I'd never get a reply. I told paypal and they claimed they got a hold of the seller and the seller told them he did send me the ""product"". I never got the study guide and Paypal took the seller's side and I got robbed. I immediately stopped using Paypal after that happened. They had lost my trust. Now I decided to give them another chance as of 4 months ago, and they are already screwing me once again. :(**

**Edit 2** - Called eBay yesterday they said on their end the eBay case was closed in my favor.  This is due to me specifying no refunds and also because it had been over a month which is over eBay's Buyer Protection Plan.  They also said they shouldn't have been able to open another case with Paypal as per policy it was already closed at Ebay.

I also spoke to Paypal after and it was a terrible experience.  The lady just seemed to give me short answers and seemed to want to get me off the phone; didn't seem to care at all. (not like I was yelling or anything, I was very polite and calm considering how mad I was inside). Anyhow she said they are seperate company from Ebay and they have a 6 month buy protection plan and that's why the Paypal case was in their favor.  She mentioned that I have to file an appeal once the item comes back to me, assuming the item comes back different from the original condition.  She said that was my only option.",17,8,2016-09-22,EBAY,0.10891307890415192,0.8603407740592957,0.030746135860681534
Ebay,"Received ""item shipped""-notification through eBay, when I checked the tracking information it stated item had been delivered the day before - never saw a package anywhere.","title pretty much sums it up. got the ""item has shipped""-notification through ebay, on a Wednesday, and when I checked the USPS tracking # it stated the package had been delivered on Tuesday morning.

In short, what's happening here? Did the package get delivered overnight, too fast for the tracking info to register through eBay and reach me? When I messaged the seller on Thursday, he said he hadn't shipped it until Wednesday - why wouldn't he know? Is this some sort of odd scam attempt?

Ebay,"Auction my SNES games, or high fixed price relisted over and over until sold?","When searching for Final Fantasy 7-9 on eBay, I see that most of the mass video game sellers do not use auction-style sales. Instead, they have a fixed price that is higher than I think most people would be willing to pay, and it seems they are relisting over and over until they eventually sell.

I guess they are doing this because eventually someone will come along and be willing to pay a lot because there are no currently open auctions for that item? And maybe old games don't have enough potential buyers to justify an auction?

But when I sold my 3DS recently, eBay offered me a sale price guarantee if I used their recommended settings, which did not include a buy-it-now price. This leads me to believe that auction style is more profitable. But maybe that is only for certain types of (high-volume?) items.

Ebay,"Trouble with a seller, could use some advice.","Hi guys, I've got a problem and would like some guidance on how to best go about dealing with it. I'm rush-typing on mobile before I leave for work so I apologize in advance for the wall of text non-formatting (edit: fixed). 

Ordered an item on the 13th. Had to communicate with the seller regarding an update on shipping, he said on the 15th that it would be out the door by the next day. Cool, no problem. 

The 18th rolls around, I get a message saying he's cancelling the sale, PayPal took a lot of money from him and he can't afford shipping (that I actually overpaid for, it doesn't cost $50 to ship a guitar from TX to PA.), he's in the middle of deleting his accounts on both eBay and PayPal, and I should receive the refund within 3-5 days but he doesn't think I'll see it yet because it was a Sunday. I ask if he's initiated through eBay regardless, no answer. I ask again the next day, no answer. I contact paypal, no record of refund in progress, same on ebay's end. 

On the 20th, I saw he initiated the refund as discussed, still with no more message communication. The problem is, today, I receive an email saying the return was declined from his bank and they'd wait another 3 business days to try again. Maybe it's just bad circumstances, but I smell scammer. 

Ebay's useless help system still thinks it ""might be on its way"" until the 29th, even with the cancellation now initiated. If it keeps declining through PayPal, do I just wait it out on ebay's end or is there a way to accelerate the process? If there's anything else that might help here as well, I'm all ears.

EDIT: One thing I forgot to add. The seller feedback was 99.1% with over 1200 successful sales, so I had no indication that this might go south.

The seller is a big seller with mostly positive but some negative or neutral reviews already. Still, they sent a very polite request that I change the feedback to positive as apparently neutral is ""the same as negative"" and there may be negative consequences for them.

Ebay,"Ebay really needs to allow an equivalent of the ""requires immediate payment"" option for auctions - even if it means putting off some potential bidders","Another day, another winning bidder seemingly disappearing off the face of the earth after winning the auction.

I really wish we could set up auctions that have a more strict payment deadline. I have almost zero problems when putting items up for sale at a fixed price - the buyers click ""buy it now"", and usually make the payment in less than 30 seconds after that. It's hassle free and everybody wins... so what is it about auctions exactly that has the winning bidders feeling like they can just turn up in the last 2 minutes, snipe the winning bid, and then just get up and go about their day as if nothing happened?

If you are manually engaged in last minute bidding on your PC or your phone, during the normal waking hours of your country, I see very little excuse for not completing the payment right then and there. Winning an auction should not be a free reservation service.

I would see nothing wrong with ebay giving us the option to set a customisable ""payment deadline"", that automatically cancels the the order after the time expires, possibly leaving a strike on the buyer's account just as would happen in the case of unpaid ""buy it now"" items. The system should then automatically make a second chance offer to the second highest bidder, apply the same payment deadline, and failing that, restart the auction without absorbing any fees.

Obviously it would be wise for the seller to set up their payment deadlines sensibly, i.e. to provide a more relaxed deadline for auctions ending late at night, or for auctions open to international bidders that rely more on automatic bidding. But it should be at the seller's discretion, and if they want payment within say, 20 minutes for auctions being held exclusively in their own country during normal hours, then that option should be available.

BTW I am writing this after setting up fairly strict filters for who can bid on my auctions. Unfortunately it seems that even ebayers with  a solid reputation are still tempted to let a completed auction languish in limbo from time to time, so I really think there should be more ways to incentivise quick payment beyond what we have now.",13,27,2016-09-24,EBAY,0.06495457142591476,0.907816469669342,0.02722894214093685

Ebay,HELP Please!!! Dealing with an overly Aggressive seller :(,"I really need help or advice with a situation- I will spare you the details but I have a seller that has been harassing me for well over a week- insulting me, insulting my ebay store, calling me names etc (yes seriously)


I purchased an item and it just went south real fast after I paid for it.  The seller is contacting me via ebay messages and my personal phone multiple times a day (yes if you didn't know ebay will give your number to a buyer/seller you are having issues with- oh the joys of fine print) i received well over 17 messages in 24 hours.. and its now a week later if that gives you any idea of my hell.. on the 2nd day - I sent a message asking the seller to contact me no further on the matter or I will contact ebay. The seller continued to  be belligerent so I contacted ebay- ebay advised me to have no further contact and they will send this to management/supervisor for investigation. Today alone I have had 5 messages all of them very rude and belittling. so needless to say I am disappointed in ebay that they are allowing this seller to continue harassing me. What can I do? Will ebay even do anything if I call back again? I can't close my account because I sell - I added the buyer to my list of blocked bidders in case they tried to do anything vengeful in that realm. I blocked their number from being able to call me. But I am still left with the harassing messages that pop in all day...

Ebay,Potential buyers asking me to use competing site. I have a few questions.,"I'll try to be brief and concise but it's kind of a complicated situation... 

So I have an item listed that received two inquiries today. 

The first was from an account with somewhere around 1800 feedback and had a storefront sounding name. No biggie but the seller asked if I would cancel and relist my item on a third party website. I won't list it here but it promises no fees and only five percent or so per sale.. Something like that...I just ignored it because I have never heard of the site and whatever you think of ebay it's the site I use... I'm protected, you're protected, yada yada. 

I then around the same time received a message from another person that had only 18 feedback... All positive... Seemed like a stay at home mom kind of account. Asked normal questions like does the item come with this and that... To which I responded and added some pictures for clarity. Then the person asked if I would perhaps be willing to cancel and relist on same website as above. 

Now I'm kind of getting suspicious and decide I'm just going to block and ignore both accounts because while I doubt they're going to scam me I just don't feel right about the whole thing. 

Well sometime later the item sold. To someone with a brand new account. Same real name as the first guy that messaged me. 

I decided to poke around and found that the account belongs to do same guy that runs said third party website. I did a whois lookup on the site. I didn't feel right about the whole situation and ended up calling ebay and explained the whole thing and they said I can cancel and refund and relist. Which I did. 
It appears that all three accounts are from the same area/person/household. 

I'm now just wondering if I over reacted or would you all have done the same thing? 

I did receive a message from the buyer asking why I canceled. I haven't responded. I'm just wondering maybe I should make contact and explain why? The accounts seem to be all in order. No negatives and the first account with several thousand feedback had left only a few negative feedback on some stuff but nothing malicious sounding. 

I'm just mostly worried that the person created a new account to circumvent me blocking the other accounts and may try to jerk me around when I send the item. 

Anyway I'm just putting my feelers out and maybe looking for some feedback. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",8,10,2016-09-26,EBAY,0.05967837572097778,0.9095994234085083,0.030722234398126602

Ebay,Struggling to sell a phone due to fake bidders,"I'm struggling to sell my iPhone 6s on eBay. Last week I had it listed and had about 16 bids from people, then a few mins before the end of the sale someone had bid £5 more with no feedback. I knew instantly I wouldn't get paid by them from my previous experience on eBay. So after going to unpaid case route I then offered the second chance offer to someone with 300+ feedback, they didn't want it because they had already won another auction.

So I relist the phone, for three days this time. Winning bidder get's it for £144 less than the first time around. But they have a lot of good feedback and I just want to sell it now. Got a message from buyer this morning that they can't pay for the phone, can we do a cancellation.

So not sure what I can do, if I relist this what's stopping the same thing from keep happening, and I'm probably going to loose loads of money on a phone that's in perfect condition, also there genuine bidders that are also loosing out from this.

My selling settings are listed as tight as they can be, although you can't block 0 feedback new bidders for some strange reason.",3,3,2016-09-26,EBAY,0.10095011442899704,0.8634949922561646,0.03555482253432274
Ebay,I Just Sold A Game. And I Got Scammed.,"Quick story: I sold a The Division XBL Key last Friday, and then I got a message telling me that 'unauthorized user of buyer or bidder account' - and that the money's been automatically pulled off my PayPal account. Unfortunately, I've sent the key to the 'buyer' the instant I got the 'item sold' notifcation.

Okay, first of all, let me state that I *just* learnt the hard way that eBay doesn't really allow for keys to be sold over there - so I'm fully aware that I'm at fault in this situation.

But I still have the physical key card in my hands - perhaps it's a good idea to send it physically to the address specified by the 'item sold' e-mail? IIRC I didn't specify that I'd mail the physical card, though.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!",15,3,2016-09-26,EBAY,0.04094511643052101,0.911702036857605,0.04735281690955162

Ebay,"Weird return, buyer screwed up scam attempt.","I had a bunch of older digital camera that I dumped on eBay. Some were just camera plus battery, some with original box and cables.  All were tested to work (power on, recognizes SD card, takes picture that doesn't look like potato quality, etc) One buyer bought one of my camera, and on same day he receives it, he opened SNAD claim it didn't work. No message, no explanation of what didn't work. I assumed he didn't RTFM and couldn't figure out why a shiny new 256GB SD card didn't work in the old pre-SDXC era camera or something.

The camera just arrived today and when I opened it, I found 2 cameras of same model in the box. One with the serial number matching listing picture and camera box was in pieces and the other camera worked.  I guess the buyer may have tried to scam me by buying my working camera, switched shell with his dead camera because serial number label aren't easy to remove, then returned the dead one to me but somehow missed his ""repaired"" camera in the camera box and sent both back to me.

I should just quietly refund him, blacklist him, move the camera gut back to the original shell so it can go with box with matching original serial number to relist and sell, and laugh at the buyer who is probably still looking for his ""repaired"" camera.

Ah well, I can still sell that working camera for about the same price as 3 weeks ago. And the average price of non-working camera is around $10-$15 so when that sells, it'd cover the shipping I spent to the first buyer and the return shipping I was required to cover.

Ebay,Local post office ends up losing me TRS,"tl;dr: Ebay policy sucks and my local post office has screwed me because of it.

After cutting way back on trying to sell stuff over the summer, life slowed down and I got things listed again.  There must have been a change at how my local post office deals with first class packages. 

In the spring I would drop things off after work using the lobby drop box.  The  service counter is closed by the time I get there.  Things were scanned in around 7pm.  There was another scan when it left and then 2 more at the local hub as it got checked in and checked out for the trip to the delivery ends regional hub.  

The last couple weeks if I dropped things off there is no local scans or scans at the regional hub.  The first scans have been popping up at the receiving end.  This leads to missing the check-in scan deadline from Ebay.  I have gotten dinged on not having tracking confirmed on a package that was dropped off at the post office 30 minutes after I had received payment.  I have had feed back of ""wow fast hipping!!"" and Ebay has tagged it as not confirmed because the local post office did not scan it.  All shipping labels are done through Ebay so all tracking is loaded instantly.  I now have fallen below the 90%+ ""validated by shipper"" required for TRS.

My solution for now is to not ship things fast.  If my carrier picks up packages from my front porch they get scanned in .  No longer will I try to get things out quick.  Everything will go out carrier pickup adding a day to the shipping times.  I use to drop things off after the service desk was closed but was able to get the item moving same day using the drop box.  I will now give a lower level of service to my buyers, have less stress on my self to get thing packed and shipped; and Ebay will reward me for doing it.

What should I do to get rid of the negative balance in my paypal account?  
  
**edit1:** I contacted eBay and they looked at the return request comments and decided to side with me. The customer service representative told me I will receive an email in the next 48 hours with the closed case details and that my paypal balance would return to a non-negative balance. Before the buyer opened the return case, he/she left me positive feedback stating the item worked.  
  
Now I will wait for my paypal balance to revert back to normal for this to be over with.  
  
**edit2:** Ebay sided with me. My negative paypal balance was reverted. Thanks for the help guys!",6,3,2016-09-30,EBAY,0.07309097796678543,0.8838797807693481,0.04302923008799553
Ebay,seller sent me a redbox game,"I bought Gran Turismo 6 video game and the damn seller sent me a redbox copy of the game. It has an annoying sticker barcode in the middle. Now, I'm especially livid because I needed a normal copy because this game has atrocious updates so now Idk if its the disc or if I'm doing something incorrect with the updates. This guy is one of those warehouse sellers. lots of good feedback. So why not right? Wrong . I learned my lesson today to not buy games from big top feedback sellers that DON'T INCLUDE A PICTURE of items. Should I even message him since I'm more than likely trading in the game( game wont update blame Sony) for just a dollar less at Gamestop?",12,3,2016-09-30,EBAY,0.14171147346496582,0.8150225281715393,0.04326595738530159
Ebay,Can someone explain this?,"https://imgur.com/a/LnCBJ

eBay tells me I am highest bidder on this item.

Though when I got to the bid history I see there was someone at $35.. apparently before me?

Am I actually the highest bidder? Or can eBay be wrong?",3,2,2016-09-30,EBAY,0.03215401619672775,0.9075831770896912,0.0602627731859684

Ebay,"Selling iPhone, winner is international, haven't been paid yet, can I refuse the transaction?","Long story short, I never use eBay and didn't realize you needed to explicitly set it so you don't have buyers from other countries. The winner of my iPhone auction is from another country in Eurasia. Not really wanting to go through the trouble of international shipping especially with all the scams I hear about. Haven't been paid yet. Can I just refuse the transaction and award it to someone else who bid?",3,2,2016-09-30,EBAY,0.028845053166151047,0.9289376735687256,0.04221731051802635
Ebay,Was I mislead?,"Title was something like ""4 cups 4 bowls"" of a particular set with a price of $20. 

I thought this was inclusive of all. Turns out in the description you need to specify (I see no where to specify) if you want the cups or the bowls, and that the cups were already sold.

There was a quantity request at the top of the page that could be one(1) or two(2). I figured this meant there were two sets of four cups and four bowls.  

Admittedly I am an ebay novice, so am I just an ebay scrub who didn't read closely enough or was I mislead.
