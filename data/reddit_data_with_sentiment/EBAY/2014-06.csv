Ebay,Buyer's confirmed address is a sports arena,"I just made a fairly large sale over eBay, the buyer had a good amount of positive feedback and he paid instantly. However, there is a slight problem, after looking up the address it came up as a MLB stadium and then after a quick Google search the buyer's name came up as a player for a player that plays in that very same arena. I'm not sure what I should do now, should I send the package and risk it being lost or should I just refund the buyer. I was planning on shipping with signature confirmation, so if I did ship to an arena there would be nobody there to sign for it and I would have to pay for return postage. Could anybody help?

**TL;DR**: Buyer is a supposed MLB player and his confirmed address is a MLB arena. I haven't shipped the item and I don't know what I should do at this point. Any help would be appreciated. 

**EDIT** I contacted the buyer and he says that there are people at the park all the time collecting packages for the players, so I went ahead and sent out his package.",13,10,2014-06-01,EBAY,0.08706487715244293,0.8649128675460815,0.04802233353257179
Ebay,How to respond to negative feedback?,"Until today I had a 100% feedback rating as a seller. Just got my first negative response which has brought my rating down to 98.5%. 

The buyer has accused me of lying about the condition of items I sell (i.e. claiming that my brand new items are actually pre-used) because they don't come wrapped in sealed plastic. All of my listings make it clear that the items wont have plastic film on them - that's just the way they come.

How can I respond to this?

On other users' selling pages I can see that they have been able to leave comments in response to negative feedback they have received... but I can't figure out how to respond to feedback left on my own page. There doesn't seem to be an option to leave a comment.",16,6,2014-06-01,EBAY,0.3707776665687561,0.6038807034492493,0.025341689586639404
Ebay,new fees for certain categories are frustrating,"Recently, I've been selling some single trading cards that I have extra, for an affordable price. Now with eBay changing the insertion fees to 30 cents (on ebay.ca) for fixed prices, I'm feeling a little annoyed.
It's not like I was making huge profits, but I did like to have BINs going until I felt like cancelling them - which honestly would be rare. Having an insertion fee and then paying a % on top of that seems to make it not worth my time.
I realize that if I go over the 50 free insertion fees, that I'd have to pay anyhow, so that's not my concern. I don't want to have to renew the auctions after 7 days if they don't sell for what my price is. Has anyone else had issues with the new insertion fees?",21,6,2014-06-01,EBAY,0.030251314863562584,0.9337198138237,0.03602888807654381
Ebay,Just made my first sale...unfortunately.,"I decided to start selling items on ebay as I had a lot of magic: the gathering cards that I wasn't using.  
Okay, so I managed to actually sell quite a bit, but then I noticed ebay sent the money to my paypal account automatically.  In the email I received it said funds were sent to *myemail* paypal.   Now, that wouldn't be a problem if I could remember the password to that paypal address or even the answers I gave to the security questions (the actual answers don't seem to be working).  
I decided to try and cancel the transaction and create a new paypal account and link it to my ebay.  It's at this point that I realized my paypal account was not linked to my ebay account...so why did the funds get sent there in the first place?  
Long story short, I have no idea why ebay did what it did, but I hope my solution will work.  
The question being, will linking my new papal account to my ebay account make the payments from what I sell go towards the new paypal account? OR will it still send it to the paypal I made when I first opened the ebay account?",4,3,2014-06-01,EBAY,0.02115623839199543,0.9347102046012878,0.04413352161645889
Ebay,So is selling game keys allowed on ebay?,"This: http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/downloadable.html is telling me no, but bunch of sellers on ebay that sell hundreds of items per month and deliver them via email, and different forum messages discussing this question say yes.

**Note:** Assuming, of course, that the seller can legally sell the item e.g. they're not stolen, bought for private use only etc.

____

I've sold about dozen items so far without any issues, and before doing any bulk purchases I'd like some clarification on this.

Also from what I understand if I mail the key via post I should be bit more covered as a seller- but seeing how that's not a concern (the profits will outweigh rare refund) should I still do it?

I'm thinking of contacting ebay directly and asking but I have items listed and I don't want to risk them being taken down for just asking a question, at least not until they're sold and money is in my bank account. So if I get clear answer here that'll be great - otherwise I'll contact ebay.

(I've searched this sub but most thread discuss the risk of chargebacks and not really the question I'm asking)

**Edit/Solved:** Heard back from ebay and it's generally allowed, the only thing that could cause issues is the shipping i.e. the email delivery *could* be considered violation of the digital downloads policy, however they also told me that all my sales are OK and acceptable soo... yeah if you have same question that's what I've been told, so decide for yourself whether or not to do it.",6,3,2014-06-01,EBAY,0.08962327241897583,0.8884980082511902,0.02187875099480152

Ebay,Seller sent money via paypal trying to cancel,"I bought a ticket to a music festival the other day. When I bought it the ""newly listed"" tag was still there but I'm not sure how long the listing was up for. The listing was an auction with a buy it now at about face, and considering the fact that tickets were sold out and going for a bit more on stubhub I decided to jump on the buy it now option. The seller is at a 92 with perfect feedback. He sent me a message today saying the following:


""I refunded your money on PayPal - as I sold these tickets on StubHub at the same time as you bought them, and since stub hub automatically ships them electronically I had to give them to those buyers.""


Now I have a couple of issues with this whole situation.


1. He didnt cancel the sale through ebay but just sent me money on paypal. Since there are paypal fees I received less money than I had sent him (by about $10). I also have the money as a paypal balance and a bill on my credit card rather than my original purchase just being cancelled.


2. Why the hell did the seller list the same tickets on stubhub and on ebay? That's just asking for trouble and to me is the sign of a really bad seller.


3. I kind of think that the seller didn't realize he could get more money for the ticket and at first just wanted to recoup what he paid for them so he listed the buy it now at around face price. When I bought it so quickly he probably realized the mistake he made and is trying to get out of it. 


Since he didn't cancel the transaction on ebay I see that I can still leave feedback. At this point I want to leave bad feedback, but I plan on talking with the seller some more before taking that course of action. I'd like to know what my possible options are in this scenario though before discussing it further with the seller.

Ebay,Pretty sure this is a case of Feedback Extortion?!,"So I've been selling on ebay on and off for the past 14 years, and I got my first Negative feedback the other day!

In his Negative feedback the reason was ""ONLY WORKS SOMETIMES, BUYER CHANGED RETURN POLICY AFTER AUCTION ENDED""

After I messaged him asking why he didn't contact me in order to resolve the issue, before leaving negative feedback, he replied with this:

I am possitive that when I bid on the item I read the shipping and return and it said 14 day return. when I played the system and it wasn't 100% functional I went back to look at it and it said no returns. should have taken a screenshot of the return policy so I could prove I was right. will retract negative if I get refund. sorry if there's was any misunderstanding with this. maybe next time write down no returns in the description.  this is not the first time it has happened to me.

So basically he's asking for a refund, before he will retract his negative feedback? That's what it seems to me..

He never gave me the chance to make anything right, he could have opened an item not as described case correct? The item in question is a super Nintendo console.. if he said it was broken I would have gladly sent him a replacement console, but he won't even reply telling me what the actual problem is, whether it's my games, his own personal non cleaned games, the system itself, etc,etc.

Ebay,WERE GOIN' GAMBLING: Escalated Not As Described Case Against Buyer To Avoid Defect,"Today I received an item not as described case (very rare for me) for a $500 item from a buyer who...

1. Stated several issues that he had with the purchase that were mentioned multiple times in the subtitle, condition, and description fields of the listing.

2. Demanded a full refund. 

3. Admitted that he did not read the description of the listing. Also kind of gave it away that he didn't look at the pics either.

I'm not sure why this gentlemen did not go through the standard return process. There is kind of a grey area between cases and returns. Why can a buyer open an IAD case if they can just return it? With negative feedback, you can call eBay and have them remove it if it contains an issue that was mentioned in your item description. What about cases? Are we supposed to just lay down and take the defect if the buyer didn't read the description? I researched and could not find a benchmark. I do see this happening more in the future, so I called eBay support and escalated it.

I've never escalated a case before so if I lose this I will be well-under the 0.3% margin that eBay allows. What do you guys think? Smart move or a stupid one?

I also talked to a Paypal representative who summarized the translation but I ended up just using Google Translate to figure out what the heck he was actually saying. I am trying to be more than helpful but as a casual eBay seller who's had no problems before, I feel like eBay/Paypal is ultimately going to side with the buyer (who's account is a month old) and make me end up reselling this (again). Frustrating. Oh also the fact that Paypal took my money back the second it was filed. As if I didn't have my credit card or bank account linked. Is there anything I can do besides help the buyer try to fix this? Is it my fault that iOS's Touch ID sucks?

Tl;dr: Buyer with 1 month old account disputes as ""item not as described"" for Touch ID on iPhone not working, will probably contest this as a hardware problem, while my money is at Paypal's whim.",7,6,2014-06-05,EBAY,0.06308311223983765,0.9079696536064148,0.028947245329618454
Ebay,"WWYD? Seller promised refund if I revised feedback, I revised feedback but no refund.","I brought a really inexpensive item from China. It arrived and was junk, not what I was expecting.

Seller sends me a second message asking to change feedback for full refund. I respond telling seller he has to send me a feedback revision request along with the link on how to do it. I get the feedback revision request, change it to positive. Send seller message asking about refund, seller claims feedback hasn't been changed.

Ebay,Buyer claims shrink wrapped software had no serial number. Am I at a disadvantage as a seller?,"Last week I sold software that was shrink wrapped to a buyer.  I offered a 14 day return policy, but stated that the shrink wrap must still be sealed.  The buyer sent me a message claiming that there was no serial number in the case.  Just as an aside, I bought two copies of the software and sold my extra one.  The copy I kept and used had the serial number on an insert within the case.  

He has admitted through ebay messages that he received the item and it was shrink wrapped and he opened it.  He has thrown around the term ""illegal software"", but I do have my receipt for the software from a reputable company and pictures of the shrink wrapped software.  

He opened up a case and is returning the software to me.  I called eBay and they told me to appeal the case once I get the item back.  I know eBay heavily favors the buyer, but do I have any chance of winning this appeal?  All in all, if I lose it's really not a big deal to me.  I'm out $65 and have my first negative, but I'm okay with that.  What really gets me is that I've been an upfront and honest buyer and seller on eBay and this will really make me have to rethink using eBay in the future.

For what it's worth, the buyer had 0% feedback in the last 12 months, but does have a feedback score of 52 (last feedback was Jan 2013).  I only have 100 or so sales, but I have a 168 rating with 4.9/5.0 for Description and 5.0/5.0 on everything else with 100% positive feedback (no neutral feedback).",6,5,2014-06-05,EBAY,0.041180551052093506,0.9096803069114685,0.049139123409986496
Ebay,Selling Account got Restricted - Please Help,"Several days ago, with no warning, my eBay seller's account got a restriction placed onto it indefinitely/permanently. A representative I spoke to said this cannot be appealed. Having pleaded with eBay's customer service on the phone to no avail, I am now turning to the reddit community for guidance. Is there a way for me to save my account? I will detail everything I think is relevant about my account and the conversations I have had with eBay below. I will try to be as concise as possible, although I expect it will be long nonetheless and so I thank you for your patience in advance.

My store:
I have just graduated college and I have been selling on eBay over the past few years. Never full time - total sales at around $7,000 - and I have achieved power seller status for the first time over the past few months.
- Total feedback: 456 with 98.9% positive.
- 196 selling transactions over the past 12 months
- Top rated performance in all areas except for 'Item as described' --&gt; Item as Described is at Below Standard performance for both the May 20 evaluation and the upcoming June 20 evaluation. As of the last evaluation (when the decision to restrict my account was made) I was at a defect rate of 7.73% (15/194). Minimum standard is 5%. Though I have only ever received 2 negative feedbacks, the customer representative I spoke with said that in this area in particular I have received more low stars.

Disputed Feedback:
- In the case of one of my two negative feedbacks, it was left as I was resolving a problem with the buyer. Eventually the issue was resolved and I asked her to change the feedback. She agreed, and asked that I complete the feedback change request form. I didn't know how that worked at the time, so I called eBay's customer service for help. The representative I spoke to said it looked like the feedback did need to get changed, but that he needed to first speak with his manager. He said that he would call back within ten minutes. It's been months now and I never heard back from them. I tried calling again today, and neither the representative nor his manager were sympathetic to my case, as it's now been well over 90 days since the feedback was left. That I called and my case didn't get the attention it was promised is documented, and admitted to by the representatives. It seems obvious to me that eBay's mistake in their customer service makes it so that they have a responsibility to change the feedback even after the 90 days mark has massed.

Other information:
- The first person I spoke to noted to me that even if I got both of my negative feedbacks changed, I will still have a score that is just below the minimum threshold required.
- After leaving them positive feedbacks, I have sent messages to everyone who has purchased something from me but hadn't left feedback asking them to please do so.


So what should I do? The first representative told me that the restriction is called 'indefinite' because eBay reevaluates its standards every now and then and sometimes invites sellers back. I'm not otherwise employed, and need to start selling online again immediately. I'm aware that I can open another store, but I'm rather attached to this one and would like to know whether I have a chance to save it. Can anyone offer advice? I will happily provide any information I neglected to include in my original post.",16,4,2014-06-05,EBAY,0.07967394590377808,0.8901327848434448,0.030193205922842026

Ebay,"Wording a request to remove Negative feedback without it being considered ""extortion""?","A recent post regarding the revision or removal of Negative feedback here really caught my attention.

For the past, I don't know, 14 years or so this has been something we've done at our store in an attempt to get rid of completely undeserved and often buyer-scam type of Negative feedbacks. We know if we've made a mistake, and there have been plenty of feedback we've had removed over the years just by simply offering a refund.

Some buyers know all about this and use it to play the game. Ex: We sold a 100% completely tested and working like-new Nintendo DS system. Not even hours after receiving it the buyer left a quick, simple Negative feedback saying ""dosnt work"".

I sent a message apologizing that she had issues with the item and offered a full refund if she would kindly revise or remove the feedback. She already knew the name form and said ""Send Feedback Revision Request and I will"". By the way, I took a look into her Feedback Left for Others: TONS of Negative feedback left, and even more Positive feedback with a little ""revised on [date]"" note underneath. Looks like someone goes on eBay to get free shit!

Anyway, she refused to revise the feedback unless she received the full refund first, stating ""AS I SAID, when i see refund i'll revise"". We sent a full refund and notified her when we did. The Negative feedback never went away. I messaged her about it. She said ""i already did it"" and that's the last I heard from her.

I called eBay and spoke to a representative about the situation. She looked into our message exchange and told us that she saw that we had an agreement to do this and that we had held up our end. She actually removed that feedback for us.

But according to the eBay rules (http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/feedback-extortion.html), we technically were using feedback extortion, were we not? We'd like to still be able to offer refunds in exchange for feedback revision. We occasionally receive Negative Feedback when we actually messed up and deserve if the buyer thinks so. Others we really do not feel we need to have on our feedback profile, as they are 100% bullshit.

Any suggestions on how to word a message asking for revision or removal for refund?",10,4,2014-06-06,EBAY,0.25370270013809204,0.7177354693412781,0.02856181189417839

The seller also defined their idea of ""condition"" as:
"" Excellent - Looks and plays perfectly.
Good - In excellent playing condition, but may have damaged artwork or packaging.""

Now the box came did come damaged to a point where most would consider it more than ""minor shelf wear"" but secondly it did not contain the items listed in the photo.

My questions are do they need to provide the photographed items? Do they need to specifically state what would not be included in the photograph? And does eBay consider the listed damage as opinion based?

Ebay,Do not escalate Item As Described cases against a buyer.,"I just wanted to make an updated post here. I'll sum up the events. I assure you my summation is complete and not exxagerated - this is not a rant, but more of a scientific observation. 

1. Buyer bought an item from me and opened an INAD case against me upon receipt. 

2. Buyer's issue was that the item did not come in the retail box. This was stated by me in the subtitle of the listing, in the item condition field, and in the item description field (twice, once in the first sentence in bold and underlined text and once towards the end of the listing.) The category selection was ""New Other"" which is specifically for new items that do not include the retail box.

3. Buyer says in case ""It is my fault for not reading but I feel that it should be included at this fair price."" 

4. I allow returns and stated initially that I would accept the return. 

5. I called eBay and spoke with a rep who would be handling the case if I escalated. I informed him that I would gladly issue a refund upon receipt, I did not want this to count as a defect and wanted to escalate to avoid it. While he did not directly advise me to escalate, he said things like ""It is not your fault if he did not read the item, this is not your problem."" ""If we find in your favor we will still ask the buyer to return the item but it will not count against you."" ""Since he did not provide any picture evidence it is not your problem."" 

7. After getting a positive impression from him I took the gamble and escalated the case.

8. The case was found in favor of the buyer. 


I will be appealing the decision once I receive the item and refund the buyer but I do not expect to win. Should I have waited to escalate until the buyer returned the item? Yes. But, my logical opinion is that this was as clear cut an incompetent buyer defect as it could get. Let me just say, if any case is winnable by the seller based on buyer incompetence, it would be this one. 

My advice is to not escalate Item As Described cases against buyers, just take the defect.",1,1,2014-06-07,EBAY,0.03956715762615204,0.9282892942428589,0.032143484801054

Ebay,Pricing your items,"(cross-posted from r/flipping)

Pricing question for you guys... I want your opinions as a buyer/seller, experienced based or not. Let's say I have an item I want to list. Looks like the average selling price for something comparative is $20. But some very similar or equal-ish items can go for $15, or maybe even $25.
Do you do price to sell, aggressively? Say, $24.99 BIN/OBO?
When you DO decide on a price, do any of you use any sort of pricing psychology (forgive me I don't know the actual term for this) say 24.99 vs 23.50, 24.47, 25, etc. If you DO use some sort of psychology, where did you learn that? I am interested in that aspect, what drives customers to buy, the appeal of certain numbers, etc.

Ebay,Had an amusing email exchange with a dissatisfied eBay buyer. I thought I'd share.,"It was amusing because the amount of money in dispute was 26 cents.  I live and sell in Ohio and, like all legitimate businesses in Ohio, I am required to collect and remit sales tax on all sales to buyers in the state of Ohio.  I sold an item for $2.69 with a shipping charge of $4.00.  He emails me after receiving the item.

&gt; Dear Sir,
&gt;The sales tax on $2.69 of sales in [city] is not 46 cents. I don't pay tax on a postage charge and neither do you. The tax should be 20 cents.

And I reply:

&gt;Dear [redacted],
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for contacting us regarding this matter. In the state of Ohio, where we both live, sales tax IS collected on any shipping or delivery charges. That tax, like all sales tax collected, is then remitted to the state, not the post office.
&gt;
&gt;Please read this document from the Ohio Department of Taxation:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.tax.ohio.gov/sales_and_use/information_releases/st200702.aspx
&gt;
&gt;Here is the relevant section quoted:
&gt;
&gt;(iv) On and after August 1, 2003, delivery charges. As used in this division, ""delivery charges"" means charges by the vendor for preparation and delivery to a location designated by the consumer of tangible personal property or a service, including transportation, shipping, postage, handling, crating, and packing.  Accordingly, the “delivery charges” referred to in this section of the Ohio Revised Code are specifically included as part of the “price” of a sale and are not a separately enumerated taxable service for sales and use tax purposes.

Ebay,"Seller running a scam, what should I do?","edit:

**Wanna make some fast money on ebay? Here's how!**


I won an auction on ebay for two nail polishes and some cuticle serum. The listing was for ""Julep Nail Polish and Beauty Lot * Unopened Pretty Spring and Summer Colors !"" It looked like the Boho Glam welcome box that is given to new subscribers to the Julep monthly nail beauty boxes. 

I assumed it belonged to someone that just didn't want it and was selling it on ebay. What actually happened is the person was selling an item that they didn't even own. They went to the Julep website and opened a new account with an email that they created that included my name and used my name and address that they got from ebay. When I look at the sellers feedback it appears they have done this 50+ times since March! 

I actually called the Julep company when I received the box thinking they must have sent me another box in error. The shipping label on the box I received is directly from the company and when compared to a box I actually paid for the labels are the same. When I called the company the email they told me was associated with the account was an email that I did not recognize and the last four digits of the credit card used to open the account were also not known to me so they cancelled the account. 

Should I contact the seller first or ebay or paypal? I would like my money back from this but I would also like to know if what this person is doing is allowed. I certainly hope it isn't permitted!",8,1,2014-06-08,EBAY,0.031147301197052002,0.934634268283844,0.0342184379696846

Ebay,Questions concerning Local pickup and separate auction with non-payment.,"Hi all, I recently sold an item with local pick up and the item sold for $250, they buyer immediately paid with paypal, but I wanted to know if it would be okay to message the buyer and ask them to pay with cash in person instead to protect myself for charge back (refunding the paypal payment prior to meeting of course)?

My second question is a buyer with low feedback bid and won an auction and shortly before the auction ended they sent me a message through ebay that I didn't see until after the auction had ended stating, ""disregard previous message and bid, sorry"". Should I cancel the transaction, or should I make a nonpayment complaint? I'm partially worried that this buyer will end up paying as soon as the complaint is made, then make a bogus complaint afterward and do a charge back.

Finally ended up selling the item for about $100, which I am satisfied with, but wondering if this is a common occurrence or if I should do anything?

Ebay,Sellers cheating the best match search rank system by adding 100+ watchers to a new listing?,"So I'm watching my competitors store and have noticed something, mass watchers are on their new recent products.

Ebay,Looking for advice on a buyer asking for a refund on an item because it shipped 2 days later than estimate.,"Last week I sold a used backpack; it was purchased by a user with 100% positive feedback, and he paid almost immediately. I've never missed a shipping date before, but I had some personal issues over the weekend (the auction ended on a Thursday) and was unable to ship until Monday (Saturday was the date that it was listed to ship by.) Monday came, I shipped, provided tracking info, and apologized to the buyer. 

Come Wednesday, the buyer sent me a short message asking for a refund, no reason. When I inquired as to why, he said that he was expecting to have the bag by Wednesday the 10th (the estimated delivery date on the original auction) and was leaving on a business trip for a month, and so nobody would be there to pick up the item.

I replied that no refunds were offered on the listing, nor did he ever reach out to me asking for the shipping to be expedited. The item is still on its way currently, however is not slated to arrive until Monday, the 16th. Granted I slipped up a bit on shipping, the delivery estimate is still just an estimate. He is insisting now that his brother is going to ship the item back to me since *""I deal with eBay a lot I usually get my shipments on date listed sometimes sooner thanks anyways""*

Is this guy way over the line requesting a refund just because the item is going to be a few days late? Would ebay be likely to rule in my favor if he offered me negative feedback for refusing him a refund?",10,1,2014-06-12,EBAY,0.0585080049932003,0.8945984840393066,0.04689348116517067
Ebay,Advice sought regards a miss listing. (UK),"Hello eBay experts.

A colleague of mine has a listed an item as a BIN. But forgot to include the fact that VAT would need to be paid. (Very bespoke bit of equipment so definitely a business to business transaction)

Rather foolishly he accepted an offer without remembering the VAT. But informed the buyer before any money or goods had changed hands. Offered to cancel the sale then and there upon realising the mistake.

The buyers are now raging about it and demand the item for the original price. 

On top of this the sellers came to our office and demanded to record that we wouldn't sell the item to them.

Really struggling to know where we stand?

Ebay,"Seller didn't return item, refund given. WTF","So, I sold an old Ipod I have on ebay.  Worked fine.  Used it the day before to make sure it worked.  Synced it with Itunes to make sure it worked.  It did.  So, worked fine before sending. 
Shortly after receiving the item, I receive an email stating the buyer opened a case against me.  Didn't work.  She wanted a refund.  BUT, she also wanted me to pay return shipping.  It was stated in my listing that the buyer pays return shipping.  This went on and on, back and forth.  I kept telling her I would give her a refund but not return shipping.  3 days later, ebay sides in her favor.  That's fine.  However, they give her the money back before she even sends me the ipod.  
Now, here's the kicker.  My account was suspended in this time.  Why?  Only the ebay gods know(but that's a different story).  I called ebay to ask them about this, and since my account was suspended, I don't fall under the Buyer Guarantee. So ebay doesn't care that she stole my Ipod?  Nice.
So, I have since contacted the BBB about this issue.
Next, I emailed the buyer asking to send my Ipod back.  Haven't received a response.  So my question is, should I call the police in her area?  Will they be able to help?  I have a feeling she had it fixed and sold it.  She is a top rated seller and that's what she does.  Should I contact the police?

On the third relist someone bid, but promptly messaged me and said it was a mistake and she wanted me to cancel it. I'd rather cancel it than deal with an unpaying buyer so I did so and she accepted the cancel ticket, canceling the auction.

I'm sure she was just trying to be nice to me but I wonder if that may have factored into my current issue.)

The type of shipping I use is Expedited Shipping (USPS Priority Mail Flat Rate Envelope), because that is what the box is. I start it as an auction for .99 and have a buy it now price of $5. Yet, only one person bids on it, and recently I just sold 3 of them for $3 -_________-

I'm just unsure of what to do? Is it worth having an auction for? If I have this certain USPS box, does that mean I can't use a different type of shipping? All I want is $5, and I want to reduce the shipping price, if possible. I'm sorry I sound dumb but I just worry I'm going to mess something up if I don't get clarification. I am just really unsure of what to do to actually get money for these items and any help is appreciated.",8,2,2014-06-16,EBAY,0.08096296340227127,0.8808836936950684,0.0381532683968544

Today someone left me a negative feedback (my only) on an item saying that it was ""very dirty"" and ""clearly worn."" The item was stark white and came new with tags, and the listing had 10 pictures of the hat from every angle. I contacted the buyer telling him I was extremely sorry and offered a full refund and to pay for return shipping, and he replied with an extremely rude and harassing message. I checked his feedback left for others and he seems to be buying similar hats on this account and then reselling them on another. This way when he goes to resell the hat other people selling them have lower scores. I've modified my listings so that only people with &gt;5 feedback can bid but is there anything else I can do?

I asked that he mail it back, and I would give him a full refund plus his shipping price.  He wanted a label in advance, and refused to send back until he got the label.

Because we are at an impasse, and the buyer had opened a case, he advanced his case and requested customer service issue a determination on the case.  They refunded all his money, and now, I am out 59.99 and a small pasta maker.

Ebay,Need honest opinions on opened case. (Buyer),"I'm not sure how to open so here it goes:

  I recently paid for a Smite Convention 2013 Kali skin under the impression that it would be the physical original card. I was only interested if it was the card and not just the code because I like to collect items since I'm materialistic. The description, which was in bold and underlined, the seller had was 
""You are bidding on an actual card. With A code on it.""
http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NDcxWDc5Nw==/z/faUAAOSwBvNTnSlh/$_57.JPG?set_id=2
Checking around, most sellers state that the code will only be emailed. And if they did not state it I asked if they would be mailing the card itself. 


  I buy from the seller with this in mind, he emails me the code saying this is to be written on your card and asks me if I still want the card to be mailed. I think it strange he would ask about the card and I say yes, but was cautious and waiting to receive the card in the mail. It comes in the mail and is a green index paper card with the code written on it. I questioned about it, he apologizes if I misunderstood and says,
""as it says in my description it is a card with the code written on it."" 
I explain what his description said and he replies,
""as the picture also shows its not a picture of a pax card i have gotten rid of all of them."" He had sold 79 of ~100.

  After more talk I ask if I could get a refund stating I had not used the code and asked if there was some sort of mutual compromise. Says no, his listing was clear and could sure if it was used or not or whether I would use it upon being refunded. I stop to think then decide to make a case as I felt that I was mislead and decided to see how ebay rule it as.


  I click the respond to case elaborating my side, but I'm not sure if that was the right place as which he then responds and we go back and forth. I state how is description differed and he reiterated each time that """"The code was written on a card just as the description stated. Just another buyer who has purchased a one time use item who used the item and now wants to get his money back.""


  At this point I had attached a screenshot with my account showing I have not used the code, since there is really no way we can check without using it and is the only legitimate way to show it. I have not used the code in any way at all, really hoping this would be resolved.
He asks ""Here is a simple question. Did you or did you not receive your code written on the index card that you try to make out as a piece of paper."" I respond that technically it is a thicker piece of paper and it was not clear of what I would receive.
Then out of nowhere, he lashes out throwing accusations and ad hominem:

""1. You in fact clearly received the index card with the code one it just as stated and are clearly trying to jade the truth by calling it something else. 2. I do not have time for your childish games. My listing was correct as was the picture. 3. Please escalate this for i will not be responding for your redundant waste of time. 4. Please for the sake of ebay do not buy one time use codes in listings and try to open falses cases against people its a true cancer to the ebay community. 5. As For i am concerned this case should be closed as should your account for trying to tarnish good sellers with rubbish false cases, just because you think you don't need to pay for items.""


  I'm really at a loss, I tried to be reasonable but this really seems uncalled for. This is the only case I've opened beside a missing item that was resolved peacefully. I tried to work it out and then explain how the description conveys the item. I've paid for codes before and made it known to him though he ends with that last remark -_-.",8,2,2014-06-17,EBAY,0.05052316188812256,0.920676052570343,0.028800848871469498

Ebay,"Hey Ebay, I resent being pestered constantly by customers who want a lower price due to the ""make an offer"" option, even when it's not present.","So I've been a seller for well over a decade.  Daily, we get people asking questions, and that is normal but now, all the time we get asked to lower our price or end an auction early.  We don't usually use the ""make an offer"" option.  I'm glad it helps others, but we dislike it intensely.  Sometimes multiple times a day, people email asking to lower the price on something.  I didn't know ebay turned into a BARTERING SYSTEM.  Hours each month are spent politely declining people in email replies.  You know what happens if you ignore them?  Well, this weekend because we were extremely busy we ignored someones repeated requests for a lower price.  When we got back to him to decline, he was self righteous and demanded to know why it took us 3x to reply, really it was because we were very busy with life... but that's our problem, right?  We had no make an offer option on the item, and had just made the ad days prior, and we weren't interested in adjusting our price.  Because of that, he bought the item and is now demanding a full refund while holding the item hostage, just to be an asshole.

Ebay,My account was used to list an item without my permission. Ebay customer service won't believe me.,"I have an old ebay account that I don't use very often. Recently, I noticed that the account was hacked. I noticed that the password and email on the account were changed by someone else from an IP address that I don't recognize. I contacted ebay, and was able to change the email address and the password back.

However, while my account was used by someone else, an item was listed on my account, and the listed was completed after I had regained control of the account. Clearly, I don't have this item to sell, so I contacted customer service again. They keep claiming, however, that the listing was made using my computer (which is ridiculous; before changing my password, I had never access the account using my current computer, which is pretty new). They won't tell me how they know it's my computer. I even told them that I don't recognize the IP address, and they still don't believe me.

So what do I do now? There's a fee charge that's on the ebay account going to a credit card that I don't own.

Now my only option appears to be to delete the account, but then I can never create a new one with my usual email address. A quick google of the name used to create the account (""123123123 123123123"") returned [this article](http://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/blog/blog.pl?/comments/2014/6/1403112295.html) explaining that many other people have been observing the same problem. I'm not sure what the motivation is... perhaps they have set security hints and are hoping that I will one day link a paypal account or something?

I had a look on e-bay soon after they sold out, and there was an Ebayuser1234 was selling 3 of these bears at $80 buy it now price. I bought and paid on: 11/06/14. 

Ebayuser1234 is no longer selling the other 2. Megaebayuser1234 is now selling 3 of these bears, with the exact same photographs as Ebayuser1234 with a $200 buy it now price. 

Ebayuser1234 still has not sent the item (as per e-bay's little sent icon). She contacted me on the 17th of June, 

&gt; hey, 
there have been a lot of items being stolen or 'going missing' from our local australia post depot or in transit so if you don't get your item 2 weeks after payment, please let me know.
thank you

Sometimes this happens, I understand - but it brought up a red flag for me since it hasn't been listed as sent. I immediately (and politely) responded requesting the tracking number. No reply. I messaged her this morning asking again if the item has been sent and for the tracking number.

I feel like Ebayuser1234 realized that she can get more money out of this item, is using a 2nd account (or friend/husband/wife) to sell them and probably won't send me my bear. 

Sorry if this post seemed cold, I tried to explain my situation clearly. I'm a little upset because I really want this bear, they sell in stores for $35 and 'scalpers' have snatched them up, selling them for ludicrous amounts on e-bay. I feel like $80 is reasonable for such a valued bear, but now I feel like I'm being played/possibly scammed. How long should I wait before I open a dispute? I really just want my bear!

Ebay,Buyer is attempt to extort personal information and free merchandise via an INAD claim.,"The buyer claims the package was opened and retaped and there was only one used shoe. Before this he'd sent me several aggressive/vague letters (which I didn't read until today, Friday-- shipped on Wednesday) wanting special shipping accommodations to ""keep the smell in.""

He attached photos but the package was taped with AirTran and I'm not sure that has anything to do with USPS Flat Rate. There was no, ""Item damaged"" sticker.

It was clear from his past buying history and weird questions (on the listing) that he wasn't buying the shoes to wear them, he was buying them for some adult purpose. I didn't want to cancel an auction for the fact, and it's really none of my business. I took this into consideration and offered to refund half the price and he said he would consider it if I answered personal questions about this shoe (and others)--the age, sex and ""looks"" of the person who wore it. He sent this via the messaging system on the ITEM in question. He asked this in regards to three of my currently listed items. When I asked him why he needed this information, he said it was because he would going to decide which item he liked best and then have me ship *that* to him instead of having me refund the first item. I called him out on this and requested him to forward the case to ebay for judgment. Even if it's not in my favor, I'm not going to play this game. 

My question is that regardless if he got the item or not, this is clearly an extortion attempt.  If I choose not to respond to the case and it is escalated to ebay, will they take into account ALL correspondences? (On the item messaging system AND the case report?) Is breaking the TOS in a case dispute reasons to *not* grand the dispute in favor of the buyer?

Also, how do I address the fact he filed a claim with USPS?! I purchased the insurance, not him. Why is he getting the check?

I really have no idea if he got the item and is lying or if he didn't get the item and saw an opportunity here. He's a new buyer with less than ten ratings.

These items sometimes get bidded up to 35 or 40 bucks and the seller completes the auction. Sometimes, the auction ends up with me being the highest bidder at ~15, and the auction just gets cancelled/pulled. 

I presume that the seller is just cancelling 'low value' winners and re-listing the same item until they go for whatever they feel is 'enough'. I dunno if it's against ToS or anything but it certainly feels wrong to me.

Ebay,Seller adds (shipping?) charge to product after I commit to buy that seems unreasonable given the size of the product. What can I do?,"So I'm sure this is one of the cases where the buyer (ie, me) is also to blame, but I was hoping for some good advice about the best course of action. Story goes like this; I recently decided to buy a small item for about 32.59£, but wanted it shipped from the UK, to Norway where I spend my summer holidays. Seller hasn't listed for any international shipping, so I  use the ""contact the seller to request an exception by requesting total"", writing a short mail asking if it's possible. At this point I had to *commit to buy* the item before Ebay would send off the e-mail, but didn't think much of it (obviously my own fault right there). A day later I receive the invoice asking me to pay. The seller has added Royal Mail International Shipping for about 4.20£, which is all good, **but** also topped it off with a 36.69£ charge! No explanation is given, no email or anything. Hastily I sent of an email through the Ebay system asking what exactly this charge was for, but it's 2 days later now and I still haven't heard anything back from the seller. Meanwhile Ebay keeps reminding me that I have to pay up soon. The item in question is the size of a small box; it can readily fit into any medium sized letter and only weights 0.3LB

So I know, I'm obviously stupid for having committed to buy an item without seeing the full price. I should have sent a message first separately before proceeding. But I had no idea that the seller then could go ahead and provide what seems like a fairly arbitrary number which I have to pay as well, especially when he/she has already listed what the actual shipping costs through RM.

I imagine that they increased their maximum bid, but then why would that show up on the counter as a bid? Wouldn't that alert the seller that the buyer is willing to pay more? The seller could artificially jack up the price with shill bids if that was the case.

Ebay,Do many of you sell on Amazon as well as eBay? I just started on Amazon and I'm liking it somewhat.,"Everything I sell either has little or no cost to me, so what I've done is listed all of my low traffic items on Amazon as they just stay listed until they sell, without having to set a recurring listing.

For now I'm keeping my higher priced, high traffic items on eBay simply to get the money faster, and the cheaper stuff on Amazon. I do have a couple higher priced items on Amazon just to see how fast/if they sell.

Ebay,Ever get a really cool eBay customer?,"Here is my story:

I sell clothing on eBay,  been doing it a few months  and I'm usually very good at inspecting my items before purchasing and listing.  But this time I fail to see a pretty decent sized hole in the armpit of a shirt that I have listed.  Of course the shirt sells and as I'm packing it that's when I notice the hole.  So being the good seller I am, I message the buyer and tell him that the shirt is damaged and that I am sorry,  and then refund their money.

They then send me this:


Dear PsychoFonz,

thank you very much for being a great seller.....I hv you on my save list and also you hv some great items...again thank you

- COOLDUDE


So I'm like cool, crisis averted.  We cancel the sale and all is good.  A few days later he buys another shirt from me and guess what,  as I'm packing it I notice its damaged also.  At this point I'm feeling like a major league idiot and after a few trips to the local stores and some google-fu,  I realize I can't find another shirt just like it as a replacement.  So I send him a message telling him that I'm sorry, but that shirt is damaged and I offer him a free shirt from my store as an apology.  He responds with this:


Dear PsychoFonz,

thank you ....I will see your store
I been looking at it for awhile you hv very good items that love to buy
and thank you again also thank gaving me a free shirt $15 and under and free shipping. .....my girlfriend like that shirt but its ok I understand Lol
thank you again I messages you today of what I want fro your store

- CoolDude


So he ends up picking a shirt and this time its all good and I send it out to him for free and he loves it.  Long Story short,  he's bought two more shirts from me since then.  And each time he messages me and tells me how awesome the shirt is.

Ebay,Buyer asking for item that wasn't included in the listing.,"I sold a Wii Rock Band Bundle that included a Drumset, Microphone, 2 Wii Guitars (one Les Paul that works with the Wiimote, One Stratocaster that requires a dongle to sync), and 2 Rock Band games. I stated in my listing that the bundle did not include the dongle and that all the pieces ahd only been tested to turn on, they had not been tested in game play.

Today, I got a message from the buyer that they got everything and it was all in good condition but they can't sync the Stratocaster guitar because they're missing the dongle. They've asked me to send the dongle but, problem is, I don't have a dongle. If I did I would've included it and priced the bundle higher in the first place.

As I see it I have three options:

A) Tell the buyer tough luck, the listing stated that it didn't include the dongle.

B) Tell the buyer that I don't have a dongle but they can return the set at their expense if they want.

C) Tell the buyer that I don't have a dongle but even though the listing didn't include the dongle I sympathize with them and out of the kindness of my heart will offer them a partial refund equal to half the price of a dongle on ebay.

My questions for the experts here are: What do you all think my best course of action is and how should I word my reply to the buyer? I don't want to come off callous nor do I want to totally bend over for the buyer since I stated in the listing that the dongle wasn't included.

Thanks for all of your help.

This is what I sent them:

&gt;I'm happy to hear that everything arrived to you in good condition. Unfortunately, I do not have a dongle for the Stratocaster which is why I stated in the listing that the bundle did not include the dongle.

Ebay,"""Fraudulent"" account","&lt;rant&gt;

About a week ago, someone used my email address to open a fraudulent eBay account.  I dug around, trying to verify if the emails were actually coming from eBay, but I couldn't find enough information online to do that at the time.  I've since reset the password on the account, so I'm sure the emails did come from eBay.

There was never a verification email.  If my email account had been compromised (which I'm reasonably certain it hasn't been), I would have still received notifications if I'd gotten a verification email.  Even if the user of the fraudulent account had accessed my account to verify the email address and then deleted the email, I would still have the notifications that I'd received it.

As near as I can tell, the user didn't do much with the account.  I got a few offers from eBay. ""$5 off makes everything better,"" for instance. But nothing about auctions, at all.  A couple days ago, the account was closed by eBay for being ""fraudulent"".  No kidding.  The email notified me that I wouldn't be able to register a new account.

So, yesterday I started trying to contact eBay.  Every avenue I found in the ""Contact Us"" section ended in a prompt to sign in, or create a new account.  I've reset the password on the account, and voila! There's no way I've been able to find to actually contact anyone at eBay about this.  Not without a phone.

Ebay,Is this legit?,"Hi all,

I'm looking to buy new in ear headphones, and one of my favorites were JBL J33. Their price at JBL site is 45e, and on eBay the price varies from $45 to $90. Most common is 60 -70 dollars.

Today I saw a new offer for $30 with included FREE UPS Worldwide Express.  Is this legit? It seems such a low price and on top of that free international shipping. 

Link to the offer is: http://www.ebay.com/itm/JBL-J33-In-Ear-only-Headphones-White-/221470490096?

I would be very thankful if someone can write me an opinion.

[I asked here two weeks ago about shipping price etc](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/27ui07/international_shipping_questions/), and thanks for all of you, tomorrow I'm going to pick my power bank :D 
Ordered for $40 + $25 for shipping to Serbia + $10 local taxes..

Thanks to ebay subreddit, I understood back then shipping costs etc. I would order these headphones for $30, but when I saw that it comes with free shipping it made me wonder.

Thanks again! :)

-- Edit:

I contacted seller that day, he never replied.  Two days later they are sold.

Ebay,"Seller may have reposted item that I bought through Buy It Now, what's my next step? More detail inside.","So I recently purchased a pair of shoes on eBay through a seller with a solid eBay reputation and lots of positive feedback. Immediately upon purchase, I notified them that because I use my debit card for paypal it would take 2-4 business days to process (I don't get this, it takes 2-4 days to process through individual sellers, and goes through instantly with wholesalers, but I digress) , to which they responded in a timely manner that would be fine and they would ship when payment cleared. A couple days later I noticed a little note under the purchase history that the item had been relisted at a %10 mark up using the same pictures as the one I bought. Once payment went through, the next day I sent a message to clarify the money had been sent to their account to which I haven't received a response and the reposted item is still on auction. I realize it's totally possible this seller may have multiple of the same item and I don't wanna rush to judgement and open a case on this, but something seems a little shady here. Any suggestions where to go from here?",5,4,2014-06-27,EBAY,0.033681511878967285,0.9230785965919495,0.04323984682559967

Ebay,BIN needs to be at least 30% of the starting price? Since when?,"I've been fortunate enough to have a friend who wants me to sell some extra inventory/seconds for a well-known jewelry brand on eBay.  I just started listing the items as of yesterday.  Prior, I'd sold a bass amp and maybe one other thing.

However, I don't remember BIN having to be at least 30% of the item's starting price!  My original plan was to offer an item starting at 30% off, with a BIN option for 15% off.  Still a good deal with the free shipping, considering everything is in pristine condition, and he said to start the bidding at around the 20-25% off range.  That way, even if someone just wanted to bid, I wouldn't lose my ass if they were the only bidder, yet they could also get a good deal if someone else wanted the item, and it is a faster moving of the inventory I have.  At 50%, though, I am going to have a hard time justifying these sales if there is a solitary buyer for each auction when one of the primary goals is to move the inventory at a relatively fast pace.

So I'm torn.  Do I chance it and potentially screw myself, my friend, and his company by selling at an absurdly low discount, hoping people are impatient?  Or do I set a fixed price that might not be particularly attractive to prospective buyers?  The items are highly collectible in a niche market, and command a pretty significant sticker price ($300-$1,600 each), so I know the market it there (in fact, one of my problems is that it is pretty saturated, so offering a good price is perhaps more important than it otherwise would be.

Any suggestions?  Better yet, any work arounds to this policy?",11,3,2014-06-27,EBAY,0.020273640751838684,0.879205584526062,0.1005207896232605

Ebay,Stand your ground and never volunteer to issue a refund on an item that hasn't bee returned.,"So, I am a computer guy at a local store, and I sell hundreds of iPads, laptops, and other electronics. I sold a laptop to a person, and I shipped it to Miami, Florida. This laptop was in pristine condition, and I had just factory restored it and physically cleaned it. Honestly, if I had had the box, I could have played it off as new. I had the booklets and restore CD too.

So, a week after the tracking info says Delivered, I get a message. This guy wants a refund because a hinge is broken. I was suspicious because I personally checked it, and I put double layer of bubble packaging around the corners, and even put more padding in the box because the buyer had said, ""please pack box to prevent from shock and damage."" 

However, I wanted this guy to be happy, so I told them to just ship it back and I will refund the money. I even said that I would pay return shipping. They responded and said that they couldn't because they are in the Dominican Republic. **WHAT?!** Yes, he had gotten the laptop, and left for the DR. He said that shipping costs would be crazy, and that he had already had it repaired in the DR, so it would be most convenient to just issue a refund. 

I told him that I can't issue a refund at all until the item is in my hands. I offered to issue a refund plus shipping up to the price that I initially paid for shipping (I had already gave him free shipping). He refused, saying that he wouldn't return it, and that I was being a bad seller. I told him that I would personally like to check the laptop because I had packed it so well and had cleaned it so well that if there was any defect that I would have noticed it.

He threatened to contact Ebay to report me. I simply said, ""My return policy states that I can't issue a refund unless I have all original contents returned to me.""

I never heard from him again. Sometimes, eBay will side with the buyer, but always always insist that the item be returned before you issue a refund. I have had many customers try this, and it is a very common and easy way for buyers to get free things.

Ebay,Yet another customer wants a refund without returning the item. And what is it? Under arm deodorant! Used now!,"Let me be clear I'm just relaying this story, I'm not looking for advice especially from those that think I should just refund to make the customer happy. 

I bought a case of Dove brand deodorant, 4-packs for the cheap at Sam's Club on closeout. Pretty popular selling for $12.95. With free shipping (Priority cause it's 1.3 pounds) and fees, I net a mere $5 profit, but it's easy work. Something I never would have expected is a buyer complaining that the deodorant didn't work for them, they're ""out the money"" and want a refund, but of course do not want to return the stuff because (and I quote) ""I can't pay for the shipping as I can't afford to because it was not my fault that i have received an item that does not work"". Uh-Huh. They claim that ""At first it was working great but after half an hour it would start wearing out. I have reapply couple of times and yet it was still wearing out. I just couldn't wear it anymore"". They of course want to work it out ""amicably"", and if I don't, they will go to eBay. To put their way "" I tried to sort this out with you. but if you want eBay to take care of it, I'll be more than happy to go their way.""

I don't know why they just don't say exactly what they mean ""I want to keep your item, I want a full refund or I'll give you negative feedback"". Funny too that this person has a new account, seems well versed in the process though, even if the English leaves some to be desired. I called eBay and they told me that a product sold new then used doesn't qualify for a refund, but I'm not sure if he was stating a fact, or just talking. I do expect a negative feedback on this, hopefully eBay will see it as buyer's remorse. 

I don't see a lot of this type of problem, but I see here others have. Why do so many people try something, feel they've been slighted, want a refund and DO NOT think they should return it?",17,11,2014-06-28,EBAY,0.06585437059402466,0.90185546875,0.032290179282426834

Ebay,Ebay buyer protection question on broken product,"Hey guys, I have a question about buyer protection. 

I am in the business of buying and selling turntables. I have done it multiple times before, however, I am new to it on eBay. I recently bought a turntable on ebay that was listed as ""works perfectly,"" but did not come with a cartridge or stylus (the part that touches the record to play). When I got the turntable, the power cable was stripped and the table turns off if the cable is bent the wrong way. This is only not functional but not safe.The table also has sticky power button that doesn't work, a speed selector that doesn't work and a tonearm lifter that doesn't work properly. On top of all of this, I put a working cartridge on the player it won't play. These are not things that break in shipping, they were obviously problems that were not tested prior to shipping.

At any rate, I filed for the buyer protection and the seller wants me to pay to ship the product from the NE to california. The cost of shipping alone will run me half of what I spent on it. I would end up losing 50USD on the whole transaction due to a seller not being honest in the description. My question is, what can I do now? Are there any options or am I out 50USD?

Do i need to cancel the order  and refund and make them check out again or just cancel the payment?",2,2,2014-06-30,EBAY,0.27843019366264343,0.7018983960151672,0.019671479240059853

Ebay,Seller broke an item that I was buying. How do I go about being refunded?,"I just started on ebay today, and I bid on a Roxio game recorder. I ended up being the only bidder and won roughly half an hour ago with a $90 bid. I checked my email a minute ago and saw a message from the sender that he sent four hours ago, a few hours after I bid originally, saying that he accidentally broke the recorder and not to buy it. I didn't see this until after I won it, so now how do I go about getting my $90 back?",0,1,2014-06-30,EBAY,0.09244607388973236,0.8603112697601318,0.047242630273103714
Ebay,Tracking number is weird,"Hi, I am new to this subreddit. 

I ordered a bicycle frame and the seller sent me a tracking number to track my item. He says that he shipped it; however, when I check the tracking number, nothing comes up. Everything is N/A. It says...

Package Location: N/A
Delivery Message: N/A
Last Scanned Date: N/A

Also, the shipping is by FedEx. I'm a bit new to eBay and all the shipping... and I'm worried if I am being scammed. Is this normal or should I be concerned. Also, its been less than 24 hrs since the seller shipped the item.

Thank you!",2,1,2014-06-30,EBAY,0.0335296131670475,0.9236944913864136,0.04277591034770012
Ebay,I was left neg feedback. We resolved the issue. Is there a way to remove the neg. feedback,I was left negative feedback for selling a mini fountain.

Ebay,Is there somewhere I can get feedback on my first ebay posts?,"I posted my first ebay auction today, and from a little googling beforehand have learned that there is more strategy to making a successful sale than it seems on the surface. Is there somewhere I can post ebay links, not for spamming, but to get some feedback on content / intro rate / shipping etc that would make my placement more or less successful?",5,1,2014-06-30,EBAY,0.02320796437561512,0.8848965764045715,0.0918954387307167
Ebay,"No record of purchase on ebay, but billmelater still has pending transcations. Help!","So I attempted to purchase a cellphone on ebay using bill me later, but at the last page for confirmation, I got an error message saying that my request could not be completed. So... I gave it another go. Same message. Now, I see that my Bill me later account has two pending transactions for $232, but I have no confirmation emails from ebay saying I actually made the purchase, not does it show up in my purchase history. Will the money be credited back to my account? Since I don't have any confirmation emails from ebay saying I made the purchase, that's grounds for cancelling my pending transactions, right? I only got a confirmation from Bill Me Later, but that doesn't solve my problems because I wouldn't be getting anything if Ebay didn't confirm it anyways. Any feedback here would be appreciated.

TL;DR: got an error message at final checkout screen, got charged twice, no ebay purchase history nor confirmation email from them.",0,0,2014-06-30,EBAY,0.212914377450943,0.761067807674408,0.026017768308520317
