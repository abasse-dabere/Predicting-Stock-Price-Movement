Ebay,I need some selling advice regarding reselling a self-refurbished iPhone.,"So i'm a fairly new seller on eBay, and I have had, so far, what I would consider to be moderate success.  

I found a local craigslist ad for an iPhone 3g for $20.  Long story short, unbeknownst to me, it was water damaged.

After taking it apart/testing it, it appears that after all is said and done, the main board is absolutely fine, but both the battery and LCD screen need to be fixed.  I checked the IMEI, and it is clean.  

Here is my question.  As long as I fully disclose what ""refurbished"" means in this context, will I have any problems selling it?  The water damage sensors will be red, but that will be nothing more than evidence that at one point, the sensors detected water.  Outside of that, it will be a perfectly working iPhone 3g.  

Am I missing anything?  Suggestions?  Thoughts?",4,0,2013-06-01,EBAY,0.04790348932147026,0.8979570865631104,0.054139409214258194
Ebay,"Seller took over a week to ship an item and overcharged shipping, what do I do?","I purchased a record May 20th, and didn't hear from the seller for a while. He said he had midterms then he was going away for the weekend and he would ship it out on Monday. That Monday was Memorial Day. I messaged him on Tuesday, didn't answer until I sent another more strongly worded message on Thursday. 

He said he was in the hospital and then ""bed ridden"" following his weekend. He apologized and said it would be sent that day with a bonus record. Today I received a message that it was sent, but he did not provide a tracking number and the item hasn't been marked as shipped.

I paid over ten dollars for expedited shipping as that was the only option. This seller also has a 80% feedback rating. I feel bad for the guy being in the hospital but he should have sent it before his trip, or sent me a message while he was bedridden.

So what is the proper procedure? Do I give him a positive, neutral, or negative feedback? Do I just give him 1 star in the shipping and communications category?",18,0,2013-06-01,EBAY,0.05594582483172417,0.913888692855835,0.0301655400544405
Ebay,Need advice with proper communication / Refund,"So I bought 2 pairs of jeans from a 2nd hand stockist. I thought that they had lots of good feedback after just reading the description, but I didn't look for a detailed view with revealed 100s of negative feedback in the past month... I'm waffling, fast forward. When I got the jeans, they were both the wrong size.

I pressed the contact the seller button on eBay and followed the instructions, clicking that I wanted a refund and filled in my notes in the box provided. It opened a case and I was emailed by the automated eBay reply.

It's been 2 days since I did that and the seller has contacted me with direct, separate emails for both items saying ""Hi, I'm namehere, I placed your order and wanted to know if everything was ok"" ""The fastest way to get answers from us is to email ebay@company.gg"" ""If everything was good, please rate us 5 stars"".

I've paraphrased that, but it seems they're ignoring my case and wanting them to email directly. Is this fishy? I shouldn't even bother with that, right because there'll be no record of it? Am I likely to claim this back with a dispute? What are they doing?

Ebay,"Sold a (mostly) brand new, unopened rare videogame collectable box set, but buyer opened a case against me and eBay ruled in their favor. If the item comes back unsealed or ruined, what can I do?","I recently sold a pretty unusual item - a complete-in-box copy of the Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete game set for Playstation 1. These box sets are highly sought after by many videogame collectors (like me), so finding a set where the disc-case was still sealed with the original factory seal is extremely unusual.

I listed the set on eBay with 12 photos and an exceedingly clear description, in which I stated that the box had some wear (which I detailed) and that the CD case was obviously shrink-wrapped but the (highly important) Sony factory seal was still entirely intact.

After they received the game, the buyer immediately contacted me to complain that the set was ""obviously resealed"" and that the outer box was trashed, both of which are false. After some (civil) back-and-forth, I encouraged the buyer to open a case with eBay, and they promptly sided with the buyer despite this being a (to my mind) obvious case of ""buyer's remorse.""

My two principal questions:

* If the game comes back trashed and/or unsealed (thus devaluing it significantly), what can I do? I have tons of pics showing the condition I shipped it in, but who would I even complain to?
* To me, the most frustrating thing about this whole experience is that as best I can tell, *I did everything right and eBay still ruled against me.* Even worse, I have no line of communication with whoever at eBay ruled against me, so I can't even request that they state where I went wrong with my listing! 

I'm so frustrated and turned off from selling on eBay again, and I don't have any guidance. Here's the item # if you're curious: 161026377476

Ebay,Am I missing something here...?,"So: on Friday I won an auction for a bike with a bid of £170 (~$250). I'm arranging collection of the boxed-up bike myself via a courier. I haven't made payment yet as the seller messaged to say he was having paypal issues -

""hi paypal promise, solve my problem in 1day.haha!we are will be see, but that not problem if my paypal account will be unsettled i've got my son paypal account.""

I replied to say I'd like to arrange pickup by the end of this week, and got back:

"" hi if my paypal account not will be reinstate very soon don't worry just send courier and pay late anyway we are will be solve this problem. your bike are ready for pick up any time.""

So he seems to be willing to send the bike off to me before receiving payment which is what has aroused my suspicion - but if it is a scam I can't see what he stands to gain! Is he just very trusting and I'm a horrible cynic? (i do plan to pay him of course!)

Ebay,PayPal wants a copy of my SSN.,"First off sorry if this has been posted about already, I did a search in this sub and found nothing, though Reddit's search engine sucks, so I'm not sure.

So about a month ago I log onto the PayPal website and am met with a page that says they require additional information.  They are requesting a copy of my social security number, photo ID and a utility bill (for proof of address).  

It said that if I don't upload these and get them reviewed my account would continue to be limited.  I go to see what limits are on my account and it says I can't add money to my PayPal from my bank account.  I can do everything else except add money from my bank account, which is fine, wasn't planning on doing that at all.  So I  ignore the request for additional information, it asks every time I log in.  PayPal has also been sending me reminder emails.

I've been selling items, buying items, withdrawing funds from my PayPal balance to my bank, everything has been smooth.  Then I get another email that says ""Final Reminder"" in the subject line.  I read it closely this time and notice it says:  ""If we don't hear from you soon, we may limit what you can do with your account until the issue is resolved.""

Now what I'm wondering is besides not being able to add money, will PayPal eventually suspend my account altogether?  Is it possible?  Has this happened to anyone else?  Maybe I'm paranoid, but I'm just assuming the worst because all the crappy stories I've heard about PayPal.

EDIT: I caved in and uploaded my info, a copy of my SSN card, DL and a bank statement, with an extra phone call everything was straightened out, thanks for the replies everybody.",25,6,2013-06-06,EBAY,0.07767245173454285,0.9002239108085632,0.022103600203990936
Ebay,"Am I screwed? First dispute as a seller, clearly buyers remorse.","I sold an HTC Media Link on ebay. (Small HDMI device that allows you to send videos from your phone to the TV).  I sold it for half of the retail value as I got it for free and wanted to get rid of it.

Fast forward a week, the buyer is asking for a refund.  He said in his original request that his phone didn't work with it.  After I politely told him that I did not offer refunds, and that the listing clearly stated that, he put in a dispute.  We've communicated back and forth, and he's changed his story from ""it doesn't work with my phone"" to ""it doesn't work.""  Luckily the messages capture both of these stories.

From poking around this sub it seems like buyers are sided with more often than sellers.  The item is not defective as I had used it once or twice before selling it (the listing was for a USED item, also). I believe that this buyer purchased it thinking it would work with his phone and wants to return it because it's not compatible.

Ebay,"Just venting, but tell me your experiences with customers.","So, today I just looked at my eBay and noticed that my last customer gave me a neutral marking. :/ This actually made me sad, so I went to check what it said. Turns out the glitter I sent to them had broken during transportation. However, they never contacted me or anything. I have extremely lenient rules, because I hate screwing people over, it's almost like that person was too lazy to go through with any of it. 

I have simple return policies which I send on a sheet of paper to remind my customers. Basically I give them 14 days to get a refund or an exchange and 20 days for just an exchange. But like I said this person didn't go through any motion, even contacting me and left me a neutral. I know I should be grateful it was not a neg. But I feel that with even being too nice, it just sucks that one person had to ruin it slightly for me. 

I feel like this will discourage other people from buying my makeup. I would be ok with neutral had she asked and I fixed it and she said something along the lines of ""Product was broken and glitter was everywhere when I opened the package, but the seller was helpful and fixed it"" I would be so much happier. :/

Ebay,So ebay basically told me to go away and come back in two weeks!,"I can't believe it.  I worked for like 30 minutes on a listing and then at the end, the ebay system said I reached a limit and wouldn't let me post it.

They actually said something about how I wouldn't be able to answer customer questions correctly if I sold more than 5 over the course of 30 days!  

The whole thing just baffles me.  I guess ebay would prefer it if I sold crappy no-name bags or something.  For me, this is just supposed to be a fun hobby and not a real business but, even so, a 5 item limit is ludicrous.

Ebay,Is this a scam? treadmills for £20,"**edit: the seller is ""No longer a registered user"". Obvious scammer is obvious**

He's selling treadmills which are usually worth 500+ euros for around 20 GBP. 

Surely this is some sort of scam. I just don't understand how exactly he's trying to scam buyers.
I went through his feedback, it's all positive. The purchasers seem to be real individuals. The products are listed in the correct category, there's a ''buy now'' button. 

I wanted to click ''buy now'', because, you know, 20 GBP - fuck it. But could it be some kind of phishing scam?

Ebay,"[UPDATE] Ugh, buyer is trying to scam me. Now have to deal with Paypal. Thoughts?","About three weeks ago, I posted this thread:

[Ugh, buyer is trying to scam me. Now have to deal with Paypal. Thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/1exxxs/ugh_buyer_is_trying_to_scam_me_now_have_to_deal/)

In short, an international buyer used a forwarding service (I don't ship internationally), and immediately filed a SNAD dispute with Paypal when the tracking showed the forwarder had received the package. He then bought a watch for $6.99 from another Ebay seller and had it shipped to me, uploading the tracking number for the watch to Paypal as confirmation of his ""return.""

At that time, I called Paypal and had the first representative agree with me that the timing was fishy (the ""return"" was shipped back the same day from California that it was delivered in Florida, right?) and promised me that not only would the buyer not get his money back, but the close would be closed within 24 hours.

Nope.

A few days later, Paypal emails me to let me know the case had been closed against me. I immediately called and spent another half hour on the phone with another representative, who could only open an appeal for me. Ok, fine. I submitted my affidavit, photographs, and other documents in support of my claim. Paypal subsequently offered me a 75% refund, and I was supposed to respond within 3 days whether I accepted the offer or not. I immediately called again; this time the rep promised that she would look into why I was only offered 75% and she would call me back, and suspend the time for response. 

Nope. That was last Friday.

Lo and behold, I logged in today and discovered the appeal had been closed and Paypal had not refunded anything. No notice, nothing. The log indicated they had sent me an email on 6/10, but I checked spam, junk, trash, everywhere, and had not received a single thing. I called them again, furious, and spent another 45 minutes on the phone with them today. I had them review the call logs (which showed how many times I had called), I had them review the documents I had submitted on appeal, and I had them escalate to a supervisor. After all of this, they have FINALLY agreed to refund 100% of the transaction and have provided me confirmation of the refund as well as contact information for the individuals involved today. 

This has been the most frustrating ordeal. If my work had not been so busy the past few weeks I would have been able to stay on them. What I've learned for the future:

1. CALL THEM EVERY DAY! Despite what they promise, they will not call you back! Get names for everyone you speak to, as well as employee ID numbers. Get confirmation numbers for everything.

2. GET IT DONE BEFORE APPEAL! I am lucky that this may work out for me, but the son of a bitch buyer got away with his refund and my phone. If it had been resolved in my favor prior to the appeal (which had been promised to me by a representative, remember?) the buyer wouldn't have gotten his money back.

3. ESCALATE! If I had pushed at the beginning, I might have saved myself from grief. This really goes hand-in-hand with #1 above, but if I had called back and insisted that the resolution be pushed through that day, and spoken to a supervisor with the authority to do it, things would be different.

Anyway, still have to see the refund come through, but I am hopeful.",4,11,2013-06-13,EBAY,0.05225186422467232,0.9104721546173096,0.03727598860859871

Ebay,Advice - Used Android phone turns out to be slightly broken?,"Sometimes when I attempt to unlock the phone the back-light comes on, but the **lock screen doesn't appear**, and I can't access the phone until I let it lock itself again, after which I try again to unlock the phone and the lock screen appears as it should do.

This is very frustrating when I need to check the time, or look up a map, or whenever I need to use the phone quickly as I have to wait 30 seconds for the phone to lock again before the lock screen will appear as it should do, after trying to unlock the phone a second time.

Is this phone sufficiently faulty to ask for a **refund?** On the listing it said that the phone was in ""**perfect working order**"", which is certainly not correct. 

I am worried that if I post it to the seller, when he receives it he may not think it is actually broken or is not able to reproduce the issue if he only tries a couple of times. The phone only seems to malfunction in the aforementioned way ~15% of the time I try to unlock it, but when it does happen it is *extremely* irritating.

Ebay,How rational are online buyers?,"I always sell my items fixed price, slightly cheaper (including postage) than the cheapest other fixed price listing, hoping that buyers are at least smart enough to sort their search from the cheapest to the most expensive. Yet everybody I know personally doesn't seem to rationally seek out the best price. As an example of buyer irrationality, I have a friend who is an avid collector of anime and manga. He once paid $250+ for a single out of print manga volume on Amazon which - if he was smart - he could have got for a mere $12 on AbeBooks. Another example: When a hardcover Zelda art book was released earlier this year it rocketed near the top of Amazon's best sellers. I found it for like $35 including postage on The Book Depository but sorted by completed listings on eBay and saw that ten or so copies were selling every day for about $70.",2,0,2013-06-14,EBAY,0.026534972712397575,0.9142011404037476,0.059263892471790314

Ebay,TIL: How to properly respond to an item not described case.,"I sold an item last week, and received an item not as described case from the buyer today. I had no other contact from them before that point. The original item and shipping was $118. The case was requesting a refund of $30. I responded immediately, approving the $30 refund. When I went to ship my other items and checked paypal, I realized ebay took the entire $118 out of my account. I called, and ebay said that once you offer any refund, they automatically take the entire amount including shipping out of your paypal, until the buyer approves your refund approval (!!??). Even if it was a $1000 item, and they were requesting $10, the entire $1000 still gets a hold. The representative said the only way to avoid that, is to do a basic text response to the case, and offer the refund in the text, then go to paypal and manually refund it. She said ebay only takes the entire amount if you formally offer any sort of refund through the case. It still doesn't make any sense, but it could save sellers some headaches if they know beforehand.",16,1,2013-06-17,EBAY,0.04210461303591728,0.918975293636322,0.03892006352543831
Ebay,Shipping rates to Israel from US.,"Hello,

I'm from Israel, and I've started bidding on a used PC video card. The seller is in California, United States. Ebay says shipping would cost $40. Isn't that too expensive? 
Ive checked the size of the item in amazon, and it is:

Product Dimensions: 9.5 x 2.9 x 11.8 inches ; 3 pounds

Shipping Weight: 3.4 pounds

This is the size of the box. The seller sells without the original packaging, so it should be even smaller.

Ive checked how much it would cost me to send this item to the US, and its about $10. I understand shipping rates are different in each country, but is international shipping really that expensive in the US?

Even if shipping boxes is expensive, I think it should be possible to send it in a parcel.

If its indeed possible to ship the item for less, how do I ask for a different shipping price?

Thank you.",13,1,2013-06-17,EBAY,0.025779051706194878,0.9209972620010376,0.053223706781864166

Ebay,E-bay and PayPal hefty fee question,"So, recently I sold an iPhone 5 on e-bay. The fixed price was $495 with free shipping but I accepted an offer of $480. After the buyer made the payment e-bay charged me a $48 Final Value Fee and PayPal another $20. That is roughly $70 less than what I sold the item from. I thought e-bay lowered their Final Value Fee to compete with Amazon but I still got charged a hefty 10%. PayPal's fee were supposed to be 2.9% + $.30 which in my case equals to $14.22, but I got charged $20. Does anybody know why are the fees so much?

UPDATE: The package made to the domestic address which happens to be a re-shipper. USPS says that it was delivered to the address at around noon today. If the re-shipper doesn't screw up and if the buyer is honest I should not have a problem, but if any of the the two entity don't do the right thing I will be in trouble because the money is pending for 21 days. Also, when the buyer finalized the payment, I got an e-mail from PayPal with the address and name of buyer. I used that exact address to ship that package. I later checked PayPal and after some digging I realized that on their's website the shipping address has an extra code-like phrase next to the buyer's name. It began with two letters and followed by 5 digit of numbers. This was nowhere to be seen in the e-mail from PayPal that commanded me to ship the package ""Now."" The inconsistency by PayPal is upsetting. This transaction still has quite a bit of potential for turning disastrous. Anyways, thanks to all for their input. I will put another update in the future regarding the pending fund. 

UPDATE 2: The pending fund on PayPal cleared through. I have the money now.

Ebay,Need advice on case I submitted.,"I won an auction for what was described as ring with a  ""Natural Alexandrite"" stone that came with an ""Appraisal"".  Well when I received the ring the appraisal was obviously a fake, so I took it to a local jeweler to get the ring checked out and they confirmed it was a lab created gem not ""natural"" as stated in the auction.  So I opened up a case for a refund and everything was going smoothly.  Seller actually bought the ring some time back on eBay and never had it checked out.  So they told me to ship it back and they would make sure it wasn't tampered with and refund me my $450.  I shipped the ring back to the seller, put the tracking # in the case and now I haven't heard back from the seller since I shipped it on 6/14.  I sent another message on 6/17 when the USPS tracking shows it was delivered asking the seller to confirm that they've received the ring back.  I still haven't heard back.

The buyer paid on Jun 10, 2013.
The item is damaged
Additional information:
""This item is packaged in a cardboard digipak. You shipped the item in a padded mailer. The digipak was totally and completely crushed. I cannot display this item in my collection with the good ones now. I can't believe you would ship like that. Please consider discounting for this error on your part.""
The buyer requested:
A replacement item***

Now, I had never even heard of a digipack mailer, and I always send games and dvd's in a bubble mailer and they have all arrived fine. Either way, it seems that the damage is consistent with what I described in the listing. Also, I did note that the item should not be bought if the buyer wanted a mint condition item, so why would the buyer expect a bent and crushed item to look good on display with his/her other items? Further, the buyer requests a ""replacement item"", but in their message they request a discount. I am not sure how I should respond to this buyer, and would appreciate some help. My ideal outcome would be for ebay to side with me, but since I don't think that will happen, I would like to just refund them, get the item back, and sell it to someone else with pictures and even more details.

Ebay,"I reported a great seller on ebay by accident, will he get in trouble?","I bought an audio component from a seller and it broke within a few months so he sent me another one free of charge. That broke again so I asked him recently to give me another item (better designed but does same thing. if it breaks I can replace the part myself) for a good price. The item costs $40 + $15 shipping but he decided to give it to me for $25 shipped. What he did is send me an email with a picture of his paypal email in text and told me to pay him there ans give him my address again, which I did. Now by mistake I clicked on the ""Do these photos violate eBay policies?"" link by accident and got a message that said this seller has been reported.

Ebay,Questions From a Brand New Seller,"I am about to make my first listing and I hope I can get some help. I've done a few hours of research and still feel nervous and confused. Not only am I oblivious to eBay, but I'm oblivious to mailing. I would hopefully like to change that though with some hands on experience.

I am selling a Magic: The Gathering card to test the waters. I have not made the listing yet but here are my concerns thus far:

1. How do I send it? I'm planning on selling this card for a $1 (which is about a dollar or so less than average) but I'm sure the buyer will still want it to arrive in mint condition. If I plan on selling this without charging for shipping, what options do I have that will not make me go in the negatives? I was thinking of using a normal white envelope as that is all I have, and then put the card in the envelope, with a protective card holder on the card. Will that be enough to ensure the card will more than likely arrive at the destination unbent?

2. This is going to seem like a very ignorant question but I am not very smart. I have never mailed anything in my LIFE. As far as I know, you go to the post office to weigh your package, pay the fee, and then they ship it. Is this how it works for eBay sellers? And in my case, as for an envelope, if I put it in the mailbox for the mailman to pick up (I guess that is a thing in the USA, no need to go to post office!), what would I put my delivery as? Under my package option in my listing, it says ""Service"" and is followed by a bunch of UPS and Fed Ex options. What would I pick for simply putting a letter in my mailbox to be delivered?

3. Last question that I can't figure out, I measured my envelope to be 9.5 inch length and 4.5 inch width, but I have no idea what to put for the depth. How do I find the depth of an envelope?

Any help and tips would be greatly appreciated. I love you all! LOVE!",4,3,2013-06-19,EBAY,0.02159811183810234,0.9169711470603943,0.06143074855208397

Ebay,Question about shipping (might have made a mistake...new),"So I listed some items, playing cards, only valued from $0.99 to $9.99, but most (5/7) being &lt;$2.00.  I was planning to ship them in envelopes using regular First Class mail.  It's going to cost me ~$1.00 each so that's what I set the shipping cost at.


I just realized that I can't get confirmation/tracking on that though.  Upgrading to parcel would be $2.00 or more, which is silly for such a cheap item.  My concern is, can I still ship them the way I was intending?  Does Ebay require some sort of confirmation that I sent the item once I sell it?  I would hate to sell a $2.00 card just to pay at least that much in shipping.  I'm panicking here thinking that I made some mistake...I can't really afford to ship them at a loss.",7,5,2013-06-20,EBAY,0.04524431377649307,0.9171594381332397,0.03759625926613808
Ebay,Sold a broken 4th gen Ipod touch for parts on an as is sale. Now I have a case open against me.,"I'll try to explain this as best as I can. On the 16th I sold a 4th gen Ipod touch. It was broken at the time of sale and was held together with tape. I listed it as an as is sale in description and said no returns in the return option.

Here is the exact description:
&gt;Selling this broken Ipod touch. This is the 4th gen model and has 8gb of memory. The screen does not display anything but everything else seems fine. It connects to the computer with no issue (I factory reset it). Not sure of what gone on inside this ipod, it appears to be held together with tape.

&gt;As is sale because of its condition.

&gt;This is for the Ipod only.

Well the buyer received it on the 19th and complained that there was damage on the inside of it. (Should have been obvious the screen is smashed I made sure to show photos). He also claims the item was ""fake"". 

Basically I responded to the case politely and calmly talking about what he said and how I made sure to list it as correctly as possible and sent that to him. I'm just worried that if Ebay makes me refund him and he returns the item that it will be damaged even more than how it started as.

Ebay,Question regarding Buy It Now.,"Hi! Just had a question on how this works.

I put my item up and someone bought it via Buy It Now. They hadn't paid after several days, and I emailed them in regards to when they were going to send their payment. They replied and said they no longer wanted the item. 

I submitted one of the Unpaid Item reports or whatever, but I'm unsure as to how this resolves. Someone explain it like I'm five?",9,0,2013-06-23,EBAY,0.05756006017327309,0.9061827659606934,0.03625718131661415
Ebay,This is why Ebay is such a nightmare to try and use....,"TV repair shop buys internal video card for a TV.  Installs it in TV, it worked (they admitted this in email).  45 FORTY FIVE days later the customer comes back to them saying it is now bad.

They are now filing a case that I should refund them.

They sold an item to a third party AND tested it...  after a month and a half they want me to be responsible for what that third party did to the card.  Now after 48 hours I get the joy of calling Ebay and getting a non-English speaking person and trying to explain to them the story or they are going to default rule in his favor like they always do.

I swear there are so few courteous buyers even left on Ebay it is hardly worth it.  If you aren't getting conned you are getting scammed, and if you aren't getting scammed someone is trying to make you responsible for their business.  If someone isn't trying to make you responsible then they are lying and trying to force a partial refund.

Already lost ALL my discounts due to liars and scammers because I refuse to give partial refunds.  Lost my ""rating"" for 6 months because Ebay uses a bullshit system that says 2 liars are more important than 164 people telling the truth.

Okay, maybe I can message the seller and work something out.

Nope. Won't let me message them. There are no bids on the item but I can't even get into contact with the seller.

Isn't that great for both me and the seller? They want to sell a product that no one is bidding on. Ebay is blocking people from bidding on it AND blocking people from even contacting them.

Essentially there are two people who want to make a transaction and ebay is standing in the middle holding them apart.

This usually indicates that both accounts belong to the same person. Registering new accounts or using other existing accounts to avoid buying and selling restrictions, limits, or other policy consequences is not allowed. At this time, your ""x"" account is suspended.

I haven't connected my account with any other.  eBay support says that for a link to take place, you have to accept or invite another account.  I didn't even know this was possible, and this definitely never occured.
 
They said the account is permantly suspended, and they have no information regarding the case because this is something their system automatically does.
 
The only way for the account to be re-instated is for the restricted account to call and clear my name.  I have no idea who the restricted account belongs to or how to contact them (obviously).
 
The worst part is, they said even if I create a new account the system will detect it is mine and suspend that one too.  They said I can pretty much never use eBay every again, and that there are plenty of ""other sites"" on the internet I can purchase from.
 
WTF!  I can never use eBay EVER AGAIN because their system decided I'm some kind of criminal???  What are my options here?  What am I supposed to do?

Ebay,Is this legal?,"Hi guys,

I have a question that I cant find the answer to anywhere, and eBay is impossible to contact directly.

Basically I have seen lately a lot of expensive items that have an extremely low price. The description then says to send an email to some gmail address in order to get pre-approved for bidding. Sending an email will result in a reply with a text along the lines of ""there is no more bidding on this item, but you can buy it now for xxx"". I don't get why they just set a bid-it-now price or a reserve. My guess would be that they set a low price in order to get high on the search result lists.

A related example is [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Tektronix-TDS694C-Digital-Oscilloscope-3GHz-10-GSa-s-/390617104481), which basically says that you are only able to buy it if you pay 2500 USD.

Ebay,First time seller. Selling my gaming laptop. I have no idea what I'm doing.,"Hey guys,

So my auction is about to end and I'm restoring my laptop as we speak and put it in its box that it came with. What should I do to make sure I don't get scammed or something goes wrong?

After the auction ends, can someone please take me through step-by-step on what happens next and what I should do?

Can I buy a box big enough to ship it through USPS for a 17"" gaming laptop?

Ebay,What to do about my unresponsive buyer?,"I'm currently selling a camera on eBay I had an issue where I provided an incorrect Paypal email to the buyer. I admit it was my fault and I called up Paypal and they advised me to communicate with the buyer and ask them to cancel the transaction and ask for their email to send a direct money request. 

I inform the buyer of this problem with the necessary information to complete the process. I don't receive a response to the email so I wait a couple of days before I shoot another email. With no luck I contact eBay and they inform me to make a request through the website for the buyers personal details. I do this and then the next morning the buyer contacts me informing me that they had been on holidays. I say that's fine and then provide them with the relevant information to complete the transaction and cancel the previous Paypal payment if it is still pending. A week passes and I don't receive a response. I contact eBay again and they advise me to make a request to cancel the transaction through the resolution centre. Due to the buyer being unresponsive I do what they instruct me to do and then after 4 days I receive an email saying that the cancellation has been denied by the buyer. I then provide them with another email in regards to purchasing the product and I still don't receive a response.

It's been a week and now I'm in the situation where I am going to be charged with the final value fee without the ability to get a credit on it to relist the item in the future. I don't know what to do to. This is my second item I've posted to sell on eBay and I've never had any problems on the website until now.

I've contacted eBay again and I'm hoping for a response really soon over this. I was wondering if any redditors on here have been in a similar situation like mine and have you been able relist the item with the final value fee being credited?",2,4,2013-06-29,EBAY,0.08568402379751205,0.8927790522575378,0.021536996588110924

Ebay,Haggling a price on eBay,"Hey all. There is an item that I saw for 200 dollars on a Buy It Now. The item wasn't in great condition and would require a 20 dollar repair so I messaged the buyer and asked if they would sell it to me for 180 dollars. They said yes and then asked me to send them the money via PayPal. 

Is this allowed? I do not believe that I would be protected by eBay/PayPal if anything went wrong with the item if we exchanged the money outside of an eBay purchase. So I am also asking, how could we go about doing this sale on eBay with the new price, but also retain all of eBay's policies and buyer/seller protection? Just trying to do this the right way.

Ebay,"So, I didn't offer free shipping, but it seems as though ebay volunteered that for me?","I'm so confused. I'm pretty new to ebaying, and my first batch of sales (we're moving, so selling a lot of random things) went smoothly, but I recently just sold a dollhouse for $10.51 and chose the default shipping (which should have been about $5.80) but when I go to print the shipping label it says their shipping cost is free and mine will be about $7.48! I NEVER offer free shipping, so I'm confused as to how this happened. 

On another quite large item, it's also saying free shipping to the buyer and $17 to me! I'm quite upset about this, and I seem to be having a hard time getting to Ebay customer support.
