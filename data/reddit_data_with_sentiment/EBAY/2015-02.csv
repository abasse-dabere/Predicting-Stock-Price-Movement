Ebay,How can people sell items in the US for $1.99 when it costs $1.93 to ship items less than 3 oz via the USPS?,Not to mention ebay and paypal fees..,13,7,2015-02-01,EBAY,0.02635270170867443,0.9341187477111816,0.039528489112854004
Ebay,Experience with eBay Valet service.,"I recently switched cell carriers and had an iPhone 4S and iPhone 5C to sell from the old carrier. My eBay profile is from 2000 and has 127 Positive feedback, but hasn't been active in many years. Knowing the amount of cell phone scamming that goes on, I didn't think I could get all that much for these 2 iPhones selling them myself since I have no feedback from the past several years. So I decided to go the route of using the Valet program, since they specifically say it's good for selling electronics, including smartphones. I shipped my items to Liberty Store in Indiana; one of the 2 Valets they have available to list items. They received them a few days later and they were being ""evaluated"" for a few days. As expected, I was happy. Then I get an email saying the valet listed them and in the same minute I got a second email saying they were sold. The iPhone 4S had a Buy It Now price of $50.50 and the iPhone 5C was buy it now $85.50. These 2 phones were in pristine condition; Liberty store even listed them separately as ""Cherished by its previous owner"". When I look at the buyer, of course the buyer id is masked, but what is visible matches on both with the same zero (0!) feedback. I'm pissed at this point as it looks like I had been scammed. Why in the world would they list these items so low? They should have had a much higher Buy it now or been done auction style. So I called eBay Valet services and they reach out to Liberty Store. Liberty admitted to the mistake and they decided that they'd credit me the difference, less the 30% commission, between what it sold for and the average selling price. I disagreed to this, because I think they would have sold for much higher had they had the chance. I couldn't get the phones back because they had already shipped; supposedly. Anyhow, stuck between and rock and a hard place, I accepted the average selling price, less the commission. The average selling price was $94 for the iPhone 4S and 5C was $180. I'll never use the eBay Valet service again. Old feedback is better than no feedback. Lesson learned. Don't trust eBay valet.",5,6,2015-02-01,EBAY,0.03134845942258835,0.9258390069007874,0.04281250014901161

Ebay,Just got scammed out of Â£145,"I've been using eBay for 13 years and this is the first time I've been scammed for this much value. Basically I sent a working GPU to the scammer who claims it's faulty, I know it's not but offer a refund, it takes 3 weeks for him to send the card back but what do you know? Something went wrong with the delivery and now it's being returned to sender, I waited in all day and Royal Mail didn't attempt a delivery so he obviously did something to the package to ensure it couldn't be delivered. Fast forward to today and I get an email from eBay saying they refunded his money (I didn't even know he'd put in a claim) so he now has his money back and in around 2 weeks Royal Mail will return my card to him.

I don't know how these people can live with themselves, I'm not a company with insurance I'm just a guy who needed that money to get by.

Ebay,"Auction winner bid on multiple of same item, now does not want to buy mine","Like the title says, a bidder won my auction for $350, but in the meantime won another auction for the same item, supposedly at a lesser price. She messaged me saying that she will be unable to purchase mine because her money has already been spent on the other auction. 

I'm new to eBay, so is there anything I can do to make the buyer pay? I told the buyer she has two options: (1) pay for the item as per the legally binding contract she entered when she bid, or (2) if she does not pay, I will issue a non payment dispute and a strike will go on her account. It just seems like eBay will only give her a slap on the wrist for being dumb and bidding on multiple of the same item. I'm afraid now, with the trend of current prices, there's no way I would get $350 for my item.",8,3,2015-02-01,EBAY,0.04654522240161896,0.9173216819763184,0.036133117973804474

Ebay,"Unpaid Item Case Question: If buyer pays by E-check on day 4, can you still close case and get your FVF back instead of waiting for check to clear?","This is an interesting problem that I have not encountered before.

Doofus purchases item on Sun Jan 25 after playing the offer/counteroffer game since Sat. Early Mon morning, I send email to everyone who purchased but haven't paid, advising them that due to the massive snowstorm expected in the North East the next couple days, payment is required by 3 EST Monday to go out that day.  Otherwise, packages may not go out until Thursday. Minutes later, Doofus replies saying 'I am in no rush to get the package. You can send it out at the end of the week.' I immediately respond, saying my preference is to get it out that day and ask if he can post payment that day.  Hear nothing from him the rest of the day, I send out remaining packages.

Wake up Tues to Snowmageddon and a message from Doofus 'Sorry, I did not see this email.  I can pay you after the storm, I don't get paid until Friday anyway'.  Now I am starting to get annoyed.  So I replied with 'Under my terms and conditions, an unpaid item case is opened after 3 days of non-payment, so a case will be opened tomorrow. It is nothing to worry about and will close automatically after payment is received.'

Never hear back from him. Open a case Thurs morning (forgot to open it Wed), wait the four days, and before I can close the case this morning and get my FVF back, he pays.  However, it is an eCheck and it says I have to wait 3-5 days for it to clear. Strangely, the case did not close automatically like it usually does upon payment and if I go into the Resolution Center, I still have the option to 'Receive Fee Credit'.

So can I still close it, get my FVF back and relist the item? Does a case stay open until an eCheck clears and the funds are actually in my account? Honestly, the dude pissed me off and I would prefer to just cancel the transaction like it never happened and relist the item. Already nervous on a neg/nuetral and I've already been waiting 8 days and will have to wait 3-5 more, I would rather just get on with my life.

In advanced listing settings, I checked off every country I would not ship to, leaving only North America. Why is option even available if a buyer from China can bid on it anyway?

Not sure where to go from here. It was a $400 item by the way, and a collectible, not an electronic. Please if anyone knows how to handle a situation like this, let me know. Will eBay side with me? Should I try to send it to China and just tack on extra shipping in the invoice?

I sold a buyer a perfectly working item, which he then broke and filed an INAD. I messaged him and asked him what was wrong and he said the item worked once and then stopped.

Now eBay says theres nothing I can do, because he never actually admitted it was broken, even though he admitted that it worked once and then stopped. The CS rep told me that even if I provide proof that due to the damage it has there's no way he could've used it, they will still side with the buyer.
They said the best I could do is report the buyer for misusing returns and eat my losses as cost doing business.

Ebay,"Potential scam, need advice.","Hey Everyone, 

I did a search and found a few situations that were similar but mine seems a bit unique. 
I posted an auction and a few hours before the auction ends a person placed a bid and they were the only bidder. The item is a low cost item $6.95(most scams I saw were high dollar items). Probably 6 hours after the auction ended I get an invoice request from the buyer. 
""I have purchased the following from you on eBay. Please send me an invoice with the total amount that I owe you."" ""please advise if delivery can take place Monday - Friday 9:00 - 15:30 as i need delivery at my workplace, please advise what the fee will be for delivery?"" They provide me with their email address, and shipping address, which is the same for ebay's address they have for them, which is in South Africa. This is my first auction in close to 8 years. So I was unaware of all the boxes that needs to be checked. I just checked the one on the auction that says ships to us only.
So I responded saying ""I appreciate your winning bid. However the auction stated in the shipping section, that it will only be shipped to the United States. Could you please provide me with a valid United States address so that I can provide you with a price?""
Their response was ""I only have a SA address."".  
They have never asked for my paypal information like in most scams, and my item is a low ticket item. So this is what has me puzzled. 
They created their account the same day the auction ended(2/3).
I only have a 25 rating.(I saw on one of the post they go after people with low ratings)

Ebay,I closed my return request and can't reopen it,"Background: I bought a PS Vita used on eBay. Seller put ""LATEST MODEL"" in the title. It is not the latest model (it's actually the earliest model). I opened up a return request. I then figured out that the device is severely water damaged as well, and the seller did not disclose that at all. I would never have even bid on it had I known it was water damaged.

Once I found the water damage, I closed my return request with the intent of opening a new one with information about how the device is even more not-as-described. I can't open a new return request, ebay won't let me. Apparently you only get one return request.

Am I just stuck with this device now, even though the seller withheld vital information about the Vita's condition AND mislabeled the device as the latest model?

edit: In addition to all this, the seller left me bad feedback: ""Terrible buyer!!! BEWARE buys electronics and takes what he needs then returns!!"" I don't even know what the hell it means. I paid the instant the auction closed and have been nothing but patient through all of this.

Ebay,"eBay buyer filed a false ""Item Significantly Not As Described"" and after two semi long phone calls, I won. Kinda","I still get to take back the return, because I accept returns. But I do not have to pay for return shipping, nor do I get a defect. The buyer is also flagged for filing a false claim. The only real ""trick"" here and reason for my post is to just say ""be persistent"". My first call to eBay resulted in someone sounding foreign who barely listened to my comments. I stopped at least four times to 5 seconds of silence and then asking ""Hello?"" only to get back the same policy quoting about how if an item is SNAD, the seller pays for return shipping. I know that. I then asked to speak to a Supervisor and of course one is not available, but one can call you. Take this route. Do it as soon as you sense the support rep you're talking to is not going to do a damn thing. I wasted 15 minutes. One did call me back about 5 hours later, and a half hour later they were convinced my listing was correct and fair, and the buyer just had buyer's remorse. I'm not going to say it was easy.

If you made it this far you might be interested in more info. The item sold isn't important, it was a group lot of 12 cheaply made plastic items painted 3 colors and just bagged up, $25 shipped. Because of the way they are packaged, they have a lot of marks &amp; scuffs. I started with hundreds of them and now down to 96. I've never had a complaint. My description clearly states they have marks and scuff on each and every one. 

The first clue the buyer was a problem was when they wanted a cheaper price. I said no. You know, what's the best you can do question. They bought anyway, and I shipped the same day and they opened a claim the day they received it. They claimed there was ""red paint all over all of them"" and demanded ""you send me a return shipping label and send me another batch that don t have red and blue paint on them."" They also said they would file a claim with Amazon (this is eBay dear), and then the old give me money tactic: ""You state they had ""scuff"" marks. I am fine with that. I'm not fine with red paint everywhere, all over the white body. That is not as described. Several even have red paint on their faces. It's either return them all and replace them--you pay for shipping--or you take 50% off what I paid, as these are unacceptable. Thank you."". She also said in another comment that her husband was disappointed. You bought them, not your hubby. And I think they've done this before.

ANYWAY, the SECOND eBay rep took this all in to account and looked at my descriptions and pictures and decided I was not at fault. Unfortunately the buyer still gets to send them back shipped for free, eBay said they would cover that. The apparently didn't have a way to change a claim to Seller pays return shipping to buyer pays. 

I hope this trend doesn't get worse, though I'm afraid it will. It's not about the money, it's the point of the matter. And as sellers *like me* decide it's not worth it, eBay will become the Amazon it wants to be.",7,24,2015-02-05,EBAY,0.11584886908531189,0.8599336743354797,0.024217531085014343

Ebay,Return Request: Buyer Not Responding,"I had a return request on Sunday for an item I sold recently.  The buyer says it does not work.  It did work perfectly when I shipped it off, but I'm not discounting shipping damage to it.

The buyer has not responded.  I sent another message yesterday, asking the buyer the same questions, and have not gotten a response as of the time of this post.

Today, we can both request that eBay ""step in and help"".  I have no problem taking a return and paying return shipping if the item is genuinely not working, but the buyer won't offer any sort of explanation beyond ""it's doesn't work"".  The item does have a bit of a concealed battery compartment, so it would be easy to not realize it takes batteries (even though I did specify it took batteries in the listing, and that batteries were not included).  I'm guessing this is either a buyer's remorse return, or the buyer was not aware that she needed to use batteries with the item - which case, the buyer should be covering return shipping and I should not get a defect.

Ebay,Seller Beware! A scam you should watch for if you're selling on eBay.,"So here's the deal. I was selling something on eBay and during my listing process I chose to add a ""Buy It Now"" option for $500 with the ability to ""Make Offer"". So a day passes and I get an offer! Awesome! Or so I thought. When you get an offer you have to either accept or deny the offer. I was going to accept his offer, but something wasn't right. He had offered me the full $500. This didn't make sense to me. There's a buy it now option for $500 and you're sending me an offer for $500....hmm. So being suspicious I didn't accept or deny. Then, not even 2 minutes later I get an email from eBay saying a user has requested my information. What the hell? I opened the email and the user that requested my information was the same user that made an offer (when a user requests your information, you also receive theirs). I messaged the user and told him to use the ""Buy It Now"" option if he's willing to pay the $500 I'm asking. No reply, and no purchases made. About 2 hours go by and I get super suspicious and look at the user's profile, absolutely zero feedback. I reread the email about the user information request and it said he had created the account THAT morning. Maybe he made an account just to buy my item? That's what I kept asking myself. So I messaged him yet again saying ""I'm curious as to why you requested my user information?"". Some time went by and what do you know, I get a text from the douchebag, asking for my paypal email so he can send me funds. The area code he texted from wasn't even the same area code in his user information that was exchanged with me. I reported the user to eBay and they said they were familiar with this type of scam and they investigating his account. I'm extremely upset with a eBay. The fact that they allow a brand new user to make a user information request towards you, while having ZERO feedback is absolutely idiotic. They get your name, phone number, city, and state which is plenty of information to find out where you live exactly. You should not be able to request anyone's information without having some sort of feedback and or at least a proven record of buying and selling. Otherwise, there is no need to request user information. I don't think I will be selling on eBay anymore unless they fix this loophole and better protect my privacy. I feel like Craigslist is safer at this point. 

Note: By clicking ""Make Offer"", you have not bought anything if the user doesn't accept. But in doing this, you are now interacting and involved with that seller about the item and are now able to run a ""User Information Request"". 


**TL;DR**: Don't add a ""Make Offer"" button to your listings.

Ebay,"USPS lost a priority mail package, claim under review, buyer wants a refund","Hi there,

I sold a bluetooth speaker for a bit over $100 10 days ago. I used priority mail, and the tracking number shows that it had two hops with USPS before there is no more information. It has stayed that way for a long time now. I filed a claim at USPS, in hopes of either an insurance payout or them just finding the package and shipping it on.

Meanwhile, somewhat understandably, my buyer is getting upset, even though they understand that I didn't really do anything wrong... They want a refund. I'm happy to front the money, issue the refund, and then get my insurance payment from USPS. However, as the claim is in process, I'm concerned that I could refund the buyer and then the package gets found, and the buyer still receives it. Now they have their money back and the product in hand.

Ebay,"Seller sent wrong size item, then claimed the return wasn't the same product he sent?!?","I recently purchased a tracksuit off eBay, I asked the seller beforehand if I would be able to return it if it arrived and didn't fit, he agreed.

When I received the item, it was definitely too small. We had previously agreed that he would send me an ""XL"" size, however I noticed the label had some black marker pen over it, which meant I was unsure if it was truly an XL size. I then contacted the seller about a return to which he agreed, also stating that his address was different to the one listed on eBay, so I should send to that address. I sent the item off with signed for delivery (I have proof of this) and waited a few days... (Please note as I did not pay for postage through ebay the item is still held in the return stage, I am not sure how to rectify this?)

About 4 days had passed and no message from the seller regarding the return, then I decide to ask if he had received my item, to which I get a reply where the seller actually accused me of sending back a different size tracksuit to him?!?

I explained that this was a ridiculous accusation as all I truly want is a tracksuit that fits. I have absolutely no reason to scam, especially as a buyer purchasing something in good faith. I even mentioned opening an ebay case against him to show that I was willing to fight this (lol). He replied with ""Yes I will start it up my self, I knew what I sent out, as I didn't have any small track suits left"", however no case has been opened, nothing has been resolved.

At this point I just literally want my money back, as I don't even have the initial small tracksuit, so my question is, how can I go about this? I cant see the option to open a case against him on eBay, so should I call Paypal and ask them to reverse the payment or something?

Ebay,Beware eBay Promotions. eBay will do everything in their power to screw you. Sell on Craigslist instead!,"A cautionary tale for anyone thinking of selling something on eBay, especially if they think they'll qualify for any of the scam promotions eBay runs:

I recently sold an HTC One M8 in near perfect condition on eBay. Rather than list it at what I considered a fair starting price, I listed it at a much lower price, at eBay's suggestion, in order to qualify for a ""Sell Your Smartphone"" promotion they were running (http://pages.ebay.com/ebayforthewin/offertermsemail.html) 

The gist of the promotion was to list the phone with eBay's suggested starting price, and if it the phone doesn't ultimately sell for the ""trending"" price, eBay will give you a credit for the difference. 

My phone sold for nearly $100 less than the trending price. I waited patiently for 7-10 business days to receive my credit. Then I got impatient and called customer service. And called. And called. 

The first time I was told I'd receive my coupon within a few days. 

The second time I was abandoned on hold for over an hour. 

The third time I was told my listing didn't qualify because I made a very slight revision to the listing (and only because I got an email FROM EBAY with recommendations to improve my listing!). Nowhere in the Terms and Conditions does it forbid revisions. I'm still contending this disqualification.

Ultimately, I have a feeling eBay is going to screw me out of nearly $100 just because they can. Stories like this one are rampant, but I just want to call attention to it so other people don't also get screwed by eBay. 

If you have something to sell, skip ebay's exorbitant fees and infuriating shakedowns, and sell it on Craigslist!

Update: After another excruciating call with customer service, I asked to speak to a supervisor. After waiting for a good 20 minutes, they said the supervisor was finishing up another call and would call me back within five minutes, even going so far as to take down my phone number.

[Final update](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2wl3tf/final_update_ebay_buyer_claims_they_received_a/)

So, I just got off the phone with customer service again after the buyer started a return and said that I would have to pay for return shipping. When I created my listing I said that I would accept returns for 14 days (stupidly), so the lady on the phone said that I must accept the return, and if I get back something that is different from what I sent (which I obviously will), I can file a claim about that. At this point I feel like I'm screwed and will just have to eat almost $1,400. Does anyone have experience with these types of situations? How has eBay been when a buyer sends back something that is completely different from what you sent out?

EDIT: I've been going through all my communications with the buyer and he claims to have won this lot at a Mecum Auto Auction:

https://www.mecum.com/lot-detail.cfm?lot_id=FL0115-203489

Would there be any way to verify this? He also claimed that he has lots of his ""exotic car collection"" stored in Arizona, and I just realized that his cell phone number comes from Arizona, so that bit would seem to line up, but it is more than likely just a fabrication to make himself seem more credible.

Ebay,Sigh. I'm so mad.,"I bought an all in one desktop PC from someone.  It arrived not as described, as there is a defective headphone jack.  I did some Googling, and found that this is a pretty common issue with this particular PC, and that it's an expensive repair.  

I requested return/refund and opened a case, the seller obviously denies that anything was wrong with it.  I had to wait until I could get eBay to step in.  Seller offered a partial refund of 5 dollars which was a joke, and I declined it.  I asked eBay to step in, they told me I am going to need to take it to an authorized service center and get a written quote on the repair.  Kind of annoying, but oh well.  I pack it up in the original packing it was shipped to me in, and take it to authorized service center.  Upon taking it out of the box at service center, I discover the screen is cracked in the bottom right.  Before packing it up, I took a few pictures of it, so I quickly pulled out my phone to see if the crack was already there and I didn't notice it.  There was no crack in the photos, so sometime between packing it up, driving 5 miles down the road, and them taking it out of the box, the screen cracked.  Dammit to hell.

So... How is this going to work out for me?  I'm looking at this two ways.  Yeah, for whatever reason, I'm responsible for the fact the screen cracked, even though I have no idea whatsoever on how it happened over the course of 30 minutes, especially packed in the original foam packing.  On the other hand, it has nothing to do with the fact that the seller sent me a defective PC to begin with, and none of this would have happened if they just didn't try to pass their issues onto someone else.

Blah.

Oh, I should add, that by doing some Google-fu with their eBay username, turns out it's the same name they used for other things, and I found a post they made on a message board about a month ago trying to troubleshoot the headphone jack issue.  So they most definitely knew it was messed up before they listed it on eBay as ""Working great"".",14,4,2015-02-09,EBAY,0.29214367270469666,0.682074248790741,0.02578209899365902

Ebay,"eBay: ""A buyer can return you a brick and you will still have to refund them via the returns system""","I had a rather concerning conversation with a rep yesterday where I was calling to report a buyer who bought an item (home arcade stick) from me and then returned it with parts stripped from it and also had taken it apart and put it back together wrong.

images: http://imgur.com/a/HoHoC

What it came down to what that no matter what the buyer had sent me back, I had zero recourse and they kept using the phrase ""cost of doing business on eBay"" as if that's acceptable. The buyer was on a 6 month old account with 2 feedback (1 was mine). The rep said that if I had refused the package that they would have forced a refund, if I ask eBay to step in and help that a refund would be forced. I specifically asked if the buyer had sent me a brick with a tracking number on it if that would still count as a return, the answer was YES and that eBay simply had ""no protection in place for sellers in this situation"". Now I've sold thousands of items across many services and even Amazon will allow a 50% restocking fee for items sent back damaged or missing parts. eBay for years has had this issue with returns.

So in short, be willing to part with your cash if someone wants to strip peices they need off of your items and then send them back to you. Also, be willing to part with the cash to pay the return shipping too! In the end, I messaged the buyer and said that if I have to issue a refund that I'm contacting their local authorities and reporting the incident, if they didn't want that, that they needed to close the return request and I would send them the stick they bought back.",19,14,2015-02-10,EBAY,0.08101719617843628,0.887625515460968,0.03135722130537033

I thought it was strange that the buyer paid by eCheck. The buyer had 4 feedback, 100%. PayPal said to hold off shipping until payment cleared (obviously with a check- eyes roll). I emailed the buyer and told him I would have to wait until payment cleared. It cleared, money transferred to my account, so I shipped item. Left positive feedback, he left me positive feedback.

Ebay,Help keeping track of inventory AND numbers,"So I've done a lot of searching on here as well as on /r/flipping and I'm completely lost.

I'm looking for a program or a spreadsheet template that will help me keep track of sales, expenses and inventory.

I've been using bookkeeping.godaddy.com, however it does not have any inventory option.

Im just looking for the easiest way of finding out the total profit I'm making on an item by deducting the item cost as well as fees and shipping from the final sale price.
I would like to know how much I have made per item, as well as total numbers.

I'm sure people have given suggestions here, however I couldn't find any clear simple solution, just a bunch of people showing off their spreadsheets...

Ebay,Transferring money from my current paypal account to one that is linked to a previously owned semi-banned ebay account,"OK, so this is a little complicated.

.

So I am an American currently live in South Korea. I've selling video games on ebay for a few years. Long story short, I had my sales privileges taken away from listing some unlicensed games. NOT bootleg games, for those who may want to jump down my throats :P

.

Fast forward a few months and I ended up moving apartments. I was able to open a new account under my wife's name since we had a new home address and new computer. So nothing would be traceable to the old account.
Now I have been able to log in to both accounts on the same computer and have had no issues (it's been about 9 months since I opened this new account). By issues I mean ebay hasn't sent me any OMG YOUR ACCOUNTS ARE LINKED messages. I HAVE NOT signed into my old ebay account since my seller privileges were taken away. If I wanted to, I could still log into that old account since they did not ban me from making purchases.

.

Now the question is, is there any way that I can send money from this new paypal account to my old one? The new address is linked to my wife's bank account which is in Korea, but I want to be able to send some of the money from ebay back to my savings account in the USA. My worry is that ebay will link the two accounts and ban me again. But I am also thinking that since I've never logged into ebay with the old account, that they wont be able to really link me. I guess it all depends on if paypal automatically shares any of this info with ebay.


.


I know I could send it to her account and then to a transfer to my American account, but the remittance fees would be much higher. Any solutions to this problem? Thanks!

Ebay,Tips for selling portable electronics for a first-time seller?,"So, with the new Sony ZX2 Walkman coming out, I'm looking to sell my old devices. 

I'm looking to sell:

* Walkman ZX1 with case ($500)
* Walkman A17 with official case ($300)
* Cowon X9 ($150)

The prices I've listed are what I initially intended to list as Buy it Now, but would it be better to just post it as an auction instead?

Also, the ZX1 and X9 have minor but noticeable damages on them from being dropped. The case for A17 also shows some sign of wear and tear from regular usage. Would I be fine as long as I explicitly state that the device shows minor damage, along with appropriate pictures? What other information should I post?

I have the original boxes for ZX1 and A17, but they are both imported from Japan, so there could be some complications with manufacture warranties. Is that something I should be concerned about? 

As for the shipping the item itself, I know that the tracking number is a must. But is there anything else I need to be aware of? Would requiring a signature on delivery a bit of overkill?

Lastly, the cases for ZX1 and A17 are selling for about $50 on ebay by themselves. Would you say that the prices I'm asking for are reasonable?",11,3,2015-02-10,EBAY,0.04211631417274475,0.9214572906494141,0.036426350474357605

I checked my PayPal and haven't received any payment whatsoever, so I am definitely not sending anything.  I then realized that I have never purchased anything on eBay and had to ask for someone's PayPal address to complete payment.

Ebay,Am I entitled to a refund? (Australian),"I purchased a ""samsung"" micro sd card off ebay, for $75, for 128gb it seemed a bit too good to be true but i took a risk since it said it posted from Australia, it turns out he imported them from China which immediately pricked my suspicion.

I received my card and it was fine, I was unable to transfer all of my data at one time from card to card which was the first alert and so i did it in batches which eventually worked. I tested the card with the SD insight app and showed the card to be invalid ie. fake. I proceeded to find that my files (music and such) was inaccessible and unreadable and eventually the whole sd card wouldn't allow me to access it. After multiple reformats and different chunk allocations and the use of another more reliable program the same issues came up every time. 

I have confirmed a return with the seller who didn't accept returns but he took it in anyway and told me the sd card was ""functional"" which to me sounds like he didn't do very much and offered an exchange but frankly I think if one card is fake they all most likely will suffer the same software issues.

Ebay,How can my buyers protect themselves from mail theft if I don't require signature confirmation?,"I sent out an item worth ~$25, and I got an angry email from the buyer because, despite the package being marked as delivered, it wasn't on their porch and I guess it got stolen (or they were lying, which would be petty). 

I don't want to include signature confirmation on these items. But I don't want unhappy buyers with stolen packages, either! So how can I advise my buyers to protect themselves from mail theft if I'm not requiring their signature?

Would it work for them to leave a note on their door instructing the delivery driver to leave it in the post office for pickup, or something?

Ebay,Advice for a first time seller? (urgent),"I sold my first item just the other day. It was a diamond ring, and the buyer has been sketchy from the beginning. I am not sure how to proceed.

2. He texted me with a very generic text, with a few spelling errors. From further communication, I can tell English is not his native language. He also mentioned the gift was for his cousin. I'm not one to judge, but who buys a $1600 diamond ring for their cousin?

3. This is the first item he has purchased on eBay.

4. This is my biggest issue. He wants it shipped to his cousin in Nigeria. He has paid me through PayPal, but the money is pending until I provide shipping proof.

I don't know how this all works. I just don't want to get screwed. Any advice?

Edit: Haha thanks. I was almost positive it was a scam, i was just hoping I was wrong. Further update, I looked closer at the email confirmation from PayPal as suggested, and it was not from PayPal.

Is it worth my time to report the buyer to eBay?

Ebay,Buyer is claiming the package I sent did not contain all the items and is requesting a return. I'm not sure what to do,"A buyer purchased a surround sound system from me on Ebay. I packaged all the items in a single package and shipped via USPS.  The receipt indicates that the package as I left it at USPS to be shipped weighed 40lbs, 7.2oz.

She received the package yesterday and immediately emailed me saying the package did not contain the speakers or remote for the system but did contain the blu-ray player and subwoofer. Also, she said the package only weighed 12 lbs. She followed up with pictures of the package. It was the exact box I had sent the items in. The postage was visible in the picture and it clearly says $62.15 on it, which matches the price on my receipt, which indicates the weight of the package noted on my receipt is correct. The tracking number is also on my receipt which I provided to her after it had shipped. This should all clearly prove that the package I sent contained all the items. I told her I would contact USPS to see if it was any possibility that they tampered with the package (in case it was too heavy or something), as that is the only possibility at this point for the items going missing. I contacted USPS Customer service, the mail recovery center, and the buyer's local branch. They all advised that if the package had been tampered with, it would be marked as such. No markings were on the package. No items were found in the recovery center, and the buyer's local delivery manager said the package had not been tampered with. I am 100% sure she is trying to simply keep the components of the system she needs (the speakers more than likely) while getting a full refund and returning the components she doesn't want. 



I filed a report with Ebay with all this information stating that she is misusing the buyer protection program by falsely stating that items are missing. However, I have not replied to her request for a refund. My only option in terms of denying her refund are to send her a message. If I do so, I know she will open a case and Ebay will step in to help. 

There's also an option to wait until Feb 18th, when Ebay will step in regardless. So, my questions are:

Should I respond with a message stating that I am denying her request to refund?

Or should I remain silent until the 18th?

Or should I open a case against the buyer? Is that possible?

The buyer has 100% positive feedback over 778 transactions; I have 100% positive feedback over 4. If this does go to a case and Ebay steps in, will my lack of transactions negatively effect me even with the overwhelming evidence I have that she is attempting to scam me?

Ebay,Have I just lost $800?,"Well, the story goes like this:

On december 31st (last year), I bought an iPhone 6 from an ebay seller in USA. After a couple of days of ignoring me, he finally shipped the device on January 6th. The item finally arrived to my country in Europe on the 15th of January and it went straight to my customs office.

As the customs office saw what's in the package, they wanted to charge me an additional $330 of import taxes, which I naturally refused to pay as the iPhone would end up costing me well over $1000. So as I refused to accept the item, naturally they told me they can ship it back to the seller. After explaining the situation to the seller, the item was sent back to him to the address it came from.

The phone went out (in the same condition it arrived, brand new and sealed) and it arrived to USA on 21st of January and somehow it got stuck in an USPS sorting facility in Chicago on January 23. The tracking info says ""We attempted to deliver your item at 11:59 am on January 23, 2015 in CHICAGO, IL 60601 and a notice was left because an authorized recipient was not available.""

Judging from the last update provided by USPS, the phone somehow got stuck in Chicago, IL and is waiting for somebody to pick it up. Which is sort of weird, because the seller is located in Florida and there's no way he can get to Chicago and pick up the phone.

Since I'm located in Europe, I cannot get in touch with USPS (tried calling them several times, no luck). Told the seller to call them, he claims they told him that since I am the sender of the package I can only tell them to deliver the phone to his address. Since I cannot get in touch with them, we've a hit a wall and nothing has change in over two weeks now.

As the 45 days for opening a dispute on eBay was closing in, I was forced to open a case with paypal and explained them the situation. After two days of wait, the case was escalated and I was told I need to provide evidence of shipping the item back and a signature confirmation of the seller when he receives the item back in order to get a full refund. Since I am unable to get USPS to redirect the package to the seller's address, does this mean I will lose my money and the phone?

Any tips would be really helpful, as my hands are tied and I cannot do anything to get this whole mess sorted out.

Thanks and sorry for the long read.

Ebay,"Seller only sent half of the items - opened case, looking for advice","I buy a lot of ram, I'm a well known user of /r/hardwareswap especially for my ram obsession. 

A few days ago, I saw some nice Crucial ram on Ebay, so I made an offer. Seller had two 2x4gb sets, asking a ludicrous $80 per set (It's $70 on Newegg). Most ram sells at $50 per set. I offered $40 per set, for both sets. He countered $80 for one set, his Buy It Now price. I countered $40/set again, [clearly stating it was for both sets](http://i.imgur.com/6f0rv1D.png) and he accepted. 

My offer was very, very cleary $40/set for two sets, totaling $80 for 4x4gb of ram. 

A week later, the ram arrived. [Scratched](http://i.imgur.com/aGk02Ft.jpg), and only two, not four, sticks.

I asked him to send the other set, he told me to pay another $80 for the other two, which he had already relisted. (you would think the fact that ebay took down his listing for selling all items would have clued him that I bought all four sticks). 

At this point, I [opened a case (read bottom to top)](http://i.imgur.com/KrgCY5T.png). 

After a tiring mess trying to deal with him, he offered me a half refund, which I said worked. He then immediately [insulted me](http://i.imgur.com/2vmCNMf.png), both in the private messages and the case messages. 

Highlights of our interactions - 

* His listing was for $80/set, so I have to pay that (even though he accepted my $40/set offer)

* Office depot has the ram for $120, so I should be glad to only pay $80. Despite it being $72 on Newegg. 

* I have to pay the full $80 because [he has to make a profit](http://i.imgur.com/47XuiOK.png)

* The cosmetic damage to the ram (which was listed as [New](http://i.imgur.com/XHlQeJQ.png)) doesn't matter because [it has a warranty](http://i.imgur.com/w3Npdi5.png) on it.  

* When caught saying he overclocked the ""new"" ram he tried to say he did it to another set. 

* He tried to claim that my offer of $40 per set was actually [$40 per stick](http://i.imgur.com/AcBMfqX.png), despite the fact that the listing was clearly [two sticks per ""item"".](http://i.imgur.com/XHlQeJQ.png)

* Continually talking about how good the ram is (it really isn't that great, I have six 8gb sticks of it already) and ignoring the fact that he accepted my $40/set offer. 

**What should I do at this point?** I was willing to take the $40 refund and call it quits... before he insulted me. The scratches on the set he did send is actually really annoying, since they're both on the same side and thereby cannot be hidden.",12,5,2015-02-15,EBAY,0.0991639494895935,0.8709869980812073,0.029849018901586533

What should I do? I am unfamiliar with other expedited shipping services that don't require a signature. Is there another service (non-USPS) that I should use or should I just ship it with the mandatory signature confirmation from USPS and hope it doesn't get returned to me or force the buyer to pick it up from the post office if someone isn't there to sign for it?

I told him I would ask a refund 2weeks later if I still had not gotten it. I did not receive it after being quite late. I asked for a refund in pm and he said he would give it to me. So I started the process to get the refund through ebay. I got the refund + I got money sent on my account for the same amount of money by the seller.
I bought an item for 31$ and now I have twice that in my paypal.
One of them was given through the refund button on ebay and the other one was money sent by him. 
The seller is from China, has like 3k+ feedbacks but he does not seem to speak proper english so it is really hard for me to understand what he means and what he is doing.

I have sent an email to PP and no answer. I told him that I received the money twice and he answered me this:

Hello my dear friend, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, project delays, you open the case, good for my shop, I have to give you a full refund, and hope you receive the package, please payment okay again? Thank you and best wishes

Ebay,Appropriate DSR Question,"Good Afternoon! I am looking for guidance on what sort of *DSR* I should leave for some recent eBay purchases.

Backstory: 

Last Monday morning, I bought almost 100 different items. All purchases were from different eBay sellers located in the US (like I am). I won't go into why I bought all these items or what the items are--as that is a whole number story and not relevant.

Problem:

There are around 15 items (that I can confirm with **absolute** certainty) which were not shipped out within the time-frame listed by the sellers. While none of the sellers waited more than 4 business days *after* their listed time-frame; I feel that a less than 5 star rating for ""shipping time"" would be fair. My question is, am I correct in thinking that **AND** how much less than 5 stars would be acceptable?

Further Details:

As a seller, I want to be a considerate/reasonable buyer and give the sellers the benefit of the doubt. For example, if a seller messages me to say they are running a few days behind, I would be understanding and still rate them 5 stars. I would not even care if they had a ""good"" excuse or not. However, not one of the 15 sellers messaged me. I also checked to make sure that the sellers were not in a location which is having extreme weather. After all, if there is a snow storm a seller may not be able to get to the post office. Plus, a really bad storm might knock out electricity and/or the internet and explain the lack of communication. But, all of the sellers were located in the southwest which is not experiencing any weather problems. 

I also checked to make sure none of the sellers had/have vacation settings turned on as many people (hopefully not me) can miss that. In addition, I reviewed the listings to make sure they didn't mention anything about their handling time-frame. Of course, sellers *should* list the correct handling time in the their shipping policy. But if they said something different in their listing, I would go with whichever is longest. Finally, I would completely forgive all tardiness if the seller upgraded my shipping to adjust for the delay. For example, if a seller was two business days late, but used 2 day UPS instead of ground (that I paid for). I would give 5 stars because they took some responsibility for their delay and made adjustments so that I would not be impacted. 

Conclusion:

For the 15 transactions I am talking about, I could not find any mitigating factors or explanation for the delay in shipping. I think that a reduction of one star for every full business day the seller was late in shipping my purchase would be reasonable. In addition, there were two purchases where I paid extra for expedited shipping and the sellers were late shipping my purchase. I think that 2 stars per day would be a reasonable deduction in those cases. Since I went out of my way to pay for a faster shipping method, I think a seller has more responsibility to ensure they handle the transaction correctly. 

 **However** before I leave any DSR for the shipping, I plan on contacting the sellers and letting them know I am disappointed with the delay in shipping. I am not going to be demanding or asking for a partial refund. If they apologize and give a good reason (like my pet/brother/wife/etc died) I will give back one star. I won't be giving back more than a star for an apology and good reason because I think they should have told me without my message. If they offer a discount I will accept and give 5 stars. I'm not fishing for a discount, but if a seller wants to, I am more than happy to stay quiet for a discount. After all, none of the delays were *sooo* terrible that I think eBay buyers *need* to know. I plan on messaging them today and waiting until Sunday night for a response. 

**Please note** I have taken great care to make sure the 15 transactions I discussed above *are not* cases which merely **APPEAR** to be sellers shipping things out late. I know that carrier/post office/tracking issues can often make packages look like the seller shipped late. In addition, I want to make clear that I made all these purchases Monday morning--before noon. 

I am looking for your thoughts and feedbacks regarding my situation. If you want more details regarding an aspect of my question, I will try and let you know. I try and be fair, but I think getting other people's opinions ensures I am as impartial as possible.

Ebay,I just got paid $450 for an item I don't own and have never listed!,"What the hell is going on? My husband and I each have separate eBay accounts. A buyer from Japan for one of his higher end vintage clothing items has bid, won, and paid for an auction ending yesterday. The money showed up in my PayPal account and eBay is instructing me to ship the item. The buyer has sent messages to me through my eBay account.

None of this is technically a problem, since I know what the item is and all the money is going to the same place eventually, but I do not like this intermingling of accounts! What if dude across the street can get into my account? Does this mean our bank accounts are intermingled? Are our PayPal accounts meshed?

Ebay,"So I bought some phone cases to sell as an experiment and it failed, how would one start doing something like this?","So I bought some phone cases from china to sell on eBay as an experiment to see if I could turn a very small profit or at least break even and reap some feedback.

As you may have guessed it failed because my listing was no where near the top and with something like phone cases people will only go down a couple of listings before choosing one.

So, hypothetically if I wanted to start again and be successful what would be the requirements, it seems like a chicken and egg situation sales &gt; feedback &gt; sales

Ebay,[FINAL UPDATE] eBay buyer claims they received a box full of junk instead of the PS4 I sent. What can I do?,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/2v4jxr/ebay_buyer_claims_they_received_a_box_full_of/)

Well, we lost guys. I got the box of junk back, weighed it, took pictures of it, and sent all of this to eBay with an explanation as to how this is clearly a scam. After that, I received this from eBay:

&gt;I am writing you today regarding the PS4 (221675321768) that you sold on our site. I understand that the Buyer claims they received trash, which has been returned to you. I know this must be an upsetting transaction to try to resolve. I noticed you have been a eBay member since February of 2009 with a great account. We appreciate your business over the past 6 years. Allow me to explain the current status of your case.

&gt;After reviewing the case details I have asked the Buyer to provide additional documentation. I have put the case on hold until 02/22 to allow time to get the documentation. This is usually enough time for the Buyer to respond, but if more time is needed the Buyer will let me know by the end of the hold.

&gt;The Buyer will need to provide a Police Incident Report. When a package arrives empty or with an entirely different item, it can be the result of theft, a shipping issue, or an oversight. The Police Incident Report will help document the problem.

&gt;If the documentation is provided, I'll review it carefully before making a decision. You'll be notified of the outcome both with email and in the Resolution Center. If we have not received this information by 02/22 we'll assume a resolution has been reached and the case will be closed without a refund.

&gt;I'll be in contact within 48 hours after the hold ends.

The buyer then attempted to file one (his police department wouldn't even file one because they told him it's a civil matter), his customer service rep called his police department and verified that he tried to, and then I got this back from him:

&gt;I'm contacting you today regarding the PS4 (221675321768) that you recently sold. I would appreciate you responding to this email with your photo proof you would like to provide.

&gt;I have spoken with the Chicago police department and the Buyer did attempt to file a report. They would not file a report as this is a civil matter. We ask that you please refund the buyer for the full purchase price plus original shipping.

&gt;We've extended the case until 02/20 to allow you to do so.

&gt;We appreciate your understanding that a refund initiated by a seller creates a better buyer experience.

I responded with this:

&gt;At what point can I appeal this case? I called customer support last night to try to, but the automated system told me that I couldn't because the case was on hold. Do I have to wait until you've refunded him?

&gt;This makes absolutely no sense to me. I sent a PS4 to ***, and now he gets it for free? You mentioned that I've been a seller with eBay for 6 years with a great account, but that doesn't seem to amount to anything here. You guys get almost $1,000 a month from me in fees and I have 100% positive feedback, with multiple sales over $2,000 that went perfectly. Why would I all of a sudden decide to scam someone for $1,300? I also filed an incident report with the police, and two other reports. Why is the buyer automatically favored after ""attempting"" to file a report with his police department?

&gt;I know you may be restricted by eBay policy here, but it just seems like they make it way too easy for people like this to steal from their sellers.

&gt;In conclusion, the main purpose of this message is to find out if and when I can appeal this case. Please let me know.

And after two days, I got this reply:

&gt;I understand you are wanting to appeal the claim once it is closed. eBay is not able to cover our Sellers in these situations. Any appeal on this claim would have to be denied as the Buyer claims they did not receive the PS4.

&gt;I know with is a very upsetting situation to you ***. You have to hold the customer responsible outside of eBay.

I just called customer service to confirm this, and they said the same thing. Nothing I can do except ""try to hold him accountable outside of eBay"". Yeah, thanks. Needless to say, I cancelled all of my listings for the Magic card sets I've been selling, and will not be doing any more business with eBay.

Thanks again, everyone, for all your ideas/suggestions/support through all this. Take this as a lesson: Don't sell anything on eBay that you aren't willing to give away for free. I mean, how much easier could it be?

A special thanks goes out to /u/wattap for being willing to help me through this. I just wish this story had a better ending.",77,44,2015-02-20,EBAY,0.07863189280033112,0.889762818813324,0.03160526603460312
Ebay,Sold a vintage 8 panel slag glass lamp shade.,"Two weeks later buyer texts my cell phone with a picture of it broken. I tell that all communication must be via eBay messaging.

Buyer insists on returning the lamp shade.

I request photos of the damage including the packaging.

After back and forth with the buyer as he has trouble attaching the photos, I finally receive photos of the damage.

I offer a partial refund to cover the damage as the buyer can have this repaired locally.

Buyer claims that the damage occurred due to improper packaging on my part, which may be true. Damage appears to me as if the lamp shade was dropped. Lamp shade was sent in a 2"" thick Styrofoam lined heavy duty box. Buyer refused to send pictures of the packaging.

Upon receiving the photos I messaged him with my return address. I file a USPS shipping damage claim using the photos. USPS mailed me a check for $50. I am out $45. As far as I am concerned the lamp shade has a value to me as $45.

About a week later, buyer charged back the purchase. PayPal is now holding my funds. There is a minimum thirty day wait for PayPal's chargeback resolution centers response. Buyers credit card company has a maximum of 75 days to decide the dispute. It is likely that the buyer will prevail as an INAD or Shipping Damage claim will win the dispute.

Because of the rarity and value I want the lamp shade returned so I can fix it and resell it, recouping my loss and potentially making a profit.

Buyer is now refusing to communicate. I have asked for a tracking number.

What options do I have at this point? How would you recommend I move forward at this point.",3,5,2015-02-20,EBAY,0.11616528779268265,0.8518898487091064,0.03194483742117882
Ebay,"Won an item that had free postage; order was cancelled due to the postage being ""too high"". I suspect dodgy behaviour...","Hey all. For the first time in a long while, I've noticed some dodgy goings-on at eBay Australia and I wanted to confide in you guys about it, since I'm pretty sure that what is happening is just not on at all.

So, I placed a bid on a VHS tape that I'd been after for a while; it was listed with a 99c starting price and free postage. I put a max bid of $30 on it, since I really wanted it, but ended up winning the auction for just $2.25. I was ecstatic, though due to the low price, I realised that the free postage option may have been checked by accident (or, at least, that the seller might try to claim this to attempt to recoup some additional funds), though by this time I had already paid. I will note that I would have been more than willing to pay for the postage had the seller requested I do so.

Anyway, instead of messaging me about it, he just cancels the order outright and refunds my payment. I contacted him following this and his brief reply to me stated that the order had been cancelled because the postage was âtoo highâ; I had previously mentioned to him (in my first message) that I would happily cover the postage costs and took the time to restate this, also indicating that I would have appreciated some form of communication on his behalf before resorting to cancelling the order.

He then replied an hour or two later, dodging my question completely and only stating that he was âoverwhelmed at the timeâ; he, once again, made no reference to the cost of postage, despite my prompting him. I then almost immediately proceeded to attempt (for the third time) to get a postage cost out of him, though it's been a good few hours since and I'm yet to receive a follow up response.

I strongly suspect that he was disappointed that the tape didn't sell for more and cancelled the order as a result, which is totally uncool and (if I'm not mistaken) against eBay's policies. However, since I didn't technically purchase the item, I am seemingly unable to leave any kind of feedback and, as such, the seller remains totally off the hook. What can I do if this situation remains unresolved? Should I contact eBay about this? This really should not be allowed to happen, though since I am unable to leave either negative or neutral feedback on the matter, I am generally incapable of bringing this activity to other users' attention.",14,5,2015-02-20,EBAY,0.059298448264598846,0.9118605256080627,0.028841059654951096
Ebay,Frequent no-paying bidders on Playstation 4,"I've been trying to sell a new Playstation 4.  I keep getting bidders with low feedback winning the auctions and not paying.  One of the bidders even sniped the bid with 30 seconds to go and e-mailed me 30 seconds later saying nevermind.  I contacted another seller and he says the same thing has happened to him 5 times.

What exactly is happening here?  My guess is it's fake ebay accounts made up by other PS4 sellers attempting to inflate the cost of PS4's to make theirs look like a more enticing deal.

I have been going through and deleting bids of sellers with less than 5 feedback, but since many bids come in the last minute of sale, I don't think this will be very successful.

I think my next step will be to post it BIN and require immediate payment.  However, my fear is now that the buyer will do that and then just retract his bid (possibly even after I've mailed it)

Ebay,Confused why buyers are often asking for some kind of custom invoice,"I work online retail for a shop that lists on eBay. It's not our main focus but we know we should tap into it, and we have been listing for years with a nearly 20,000 feedback score now. I personally handle most of our eBay sales and questions so should be the most knowledgeable about the process, yet I am constantly stumped by one thing. 

Occasionally we get sent messages from potential buyers who tell us a list of items they want and ask us to send them an invoice, presumably so they can save time adding it to basket and having to request a total from seller. They do not add anything to their basket or ""commit to buy"" at this point though, so we're not able to simply combine the items for them. Nothing exists in eBay for their username.

Since I didn't see how this was possible to do on eBay, I always assumed they simply wanted a PayPal money request sent to them for the total cost of the items (outside of eBay, and against eBay policy) but we have no way of even knowing what their email address it to even consider doing that. They have never volunteered this information with their invoice requests.

The most confusing thing is that these people tend to have eBay feedback scores in the hundreds, so are presumably experienced buyers. I just don't understand what kind of invoices they may have been sent in the past (under the same circumstances - nothing in their basket) from other sellers to warrant asking this of us with such confidence.

Ebay,When to leave negative feedback?,"What would you say your guys views on Negative feedback is? I am thinking of leaving negative for something I bought

I sell around 20 things on eBay a month, all computer/server related and I always make sure to test every item and list it in great detail. I have had probably 3 returns. 1 was a guy who dropped the item and claimed it was like that, a second was a guy trying to scam me, and the third was a guy saying an item didnt work, but he admitted he was unsure if it was compatible. I tested it and resold it

I recently bought some ECC Server RAM, and the listing claimed that it was ""100% Tested""

Upon getting the item, it was questionably packaged and the item clearly had issues, when running a memtest it would just fail and reboot, and the system did not boot properly. I know with 100% certainty that its the item at fault, and not me or my equipment as I have the exact same memory in the system, and its on the Qualified hardware list. I also tested it in multiple machines

This was clearly not tested, so should I leave negative feedback? It has wasted 2 weeks of my time and I wasted about 4 hours of man time investigating the issue 

I messaged them and opened a ""Return"" asking how they tested the item, as it clearly never worked. All they did was give me a shipping label, no response or apology at all. 

I feel like they just list everything as tested and hope it doesn't come back

Ebay,"10yr Account. 1200+ 100% positive feedback. One bad month (stolen packages, a few broken ones.) Seller rating drops to below average. Suddenly, paypal holds and fear of account closure. What do I do?!","The title kind of explains it all but to elaborate without TL:DRing:

I have a 10 year old ebay account with 100% positive feedback, over 1200 ratings, mostly sales. This past month I had five outgoing packages stolen from my porch and had to cancel those sales and do refunds. I also had a few packages with fragile items arrive damaged (thanks USPS.)

Because of this suddenly my seller rating has dropped to below standard, and as a result my paypal account now has limitations (21 day hold on funds.) I can live with this. It's inconvenient but I ship quickly so they should be released fairly quickly.

However someone has told me that I should be worried because having an account with below standard rating puts it at risk for complete closure without warning. I'm further told that ebay will not even CONSIDER reversing that if it happens, and that there's nothing I can do to prevent it.

Is this for real? Will eBay seriously shut down a pristine account over several incidents that were out of my control? Would contacting ebay and explaining what happened to a representative behoove me, or would that just draw more attention to my account and make it worse?

Frequently, I see auctions with a final price 2x or more the going price. This auctions frequently have 2 bidders with 0 feedback that drive up the price at the end. Here is an [example](http://imgur.com/rfXBq8d.png). I presume these are just shill bidders that the seller uses when their auction isn't going well in the last 24 hr, but this behavior seems really prevalent for something so ridiculously obvious.

Ebay,"Potentially getting screwed by an eBay seller, what should I do here?","Here's whats going on. I of course missed out on the Batman Arkham Knight Batmobile edition ($200 in store) and its sold out everywhere so I've been monitoring ebay everyday. I find a BIN listing for the PS4 version, for $199, free shipping and guaranteed delivery by release date otherwise you get a refund. Now here is where things get VERY FISHY.

Me being impulsive, I bought the damn thing right away without doing too much homework on the guy besides looking at his feedback. This guy has been a member since november of 2014 with feedback of 98.7%, and 75 feedback. He has about 45 seller feedbacks, mostly from selling POKEMON CARDS (another fishy detail). When I first found the listing for the game, the auction said he had over 10 Batmobile editions for sale, and had another listing for the XB1 edition with more then 10 available. He also had two more listings of another hard to find special edition for another game that I forgot which ended quickly. The listings have all ended with everything sold, and now he has no listings currently running as of now (another fishy detail).

He says in the auction description that he is a ""distributor"" and that he ""receives games a month before the release date,"" and promises that I would receive the game two weeks before the release date (another fishy detail). He says he accepts all returns but you might have to pay a BS 20% restocking fee, which is also another fishy point. 

Heres the fishiest point of all. In the auction, he states that ""you will receive a confirmation letter by mail, to confirm the address where the listed game will arrive."" I got the letter a few days ago (along with a positive feedback) and it had a tracking number attached to it, with an ebay shipping label. Turns out that tracking number corresponded to the auction listing, and now it says ""the item was delivered"" on my ebay page.... which is a good way for this guy to cover for his tracks if he was a scammer. By showing ebay and paypal proof that SOMETHING was shipped, he could use that to beat the system. I feel like emailing this guy right now demanding my money back...nothing feels right about this at all. I've preordered things on ebay before but this just smells like a scam to me. 

The question is, even if I do wait until june (release day) and nothing shows, is it too late to file a claim with ebay/paypal to get my money back? I knew it seemed too good to be true but if I really did fall for a scam, I need to act ASAP.

Ebay,Item Not Received - trying to find the balance between giving the seller the benefit of the doubt and making sure I'm not being scammed.,"This was my first semi-expensive eBay purchase, and this is my first time posting here. 

I bought an iPad on 2/12. The estimated delivery date was 2/20. On 2/18, I hadn't heard anything from the seller, so I messaged him asking when he was planning on shipping the item. His response was ""this week or next, it is snow in my state."" Great. 

He sent me this a little while later: ""I TRY MY BEST THIS WEEK OKAY.IF NOT THEN NEXT . THANK YOU""

I said that I was hoping to have the iPad on/around the 20th, and if he wasn't able to ship it by the 24th, I'd rather just cancel the order and get a refund. He sent me a message on Monday saying that he shipped it, and gave me a tracking number. 

The tracking number is invalid. (I tried copy-pasting it to the tracking pages for UPS, USPS, FedEx, and DHL, and it's definitely not a tracking number associated with any of those services). I sent him a message asking if he could double-check the number, and he said ""I send it yesterday."" 

What's my next step? Do I keep waiting in the hopes that the guy is honest-but-incompetent, or do I open an Item Not Received case now?

**TL;DR:** Bought an item on the 12th, estimated delivery date was the 20th, seller claims he shipped it on Monday and gave me an invalid tracking number, and I don't know what to do.

**UPDATE:** I contacted the seller and told him that his tracking number was still showing up as invalid on UPS's site two days after he allegedly sent it. His response: ""I already sent it and I lost I lost the tracking number. I can't find it I send it on Monday."" Poor thing, trapped in the snow and conveniently losing his fake-ass tracking number.

Ebay,INR ridiculousness by Ebay,"Customer opened a case against me for item not received. I told them to wait a few days and if it still didn't arrive, I would refund them the money. Few days pass, item didn't arrive, so I refunded them. A couple days later, they message me to tell me that the item arrived and they want to pay me. Perfect.
I called ebay yesterday to get this case removed from my dashboard since the item arrived. The rep from the escalation team said that they can't because it didn't arrive in the specified shipping time. Yes, ebay considers that item ""not received"" because it didn't get delivered within the specified shipping time. The rep also mentioned that if the item isn't delivered within the estimated delivery date, that it is also considered ""not received"". 
After they told me this, I basically ripped them a new one. They forcefully inject this estimated delivery date into my listings and then use that as a point of reference in case some trigger happy fool decides to open an INR case too early. I was in shock. 

I ship from overseas, so it could take anywhere up to 21 business days, even longer. I specify that in my listings. When I created my shipping policies, they have standard economy international shipping, and that indicated 11-23 business days, I cannot choose longer.

I opened a return case hoping to return it and the seller refused to respond. I escalated it to eBay customer support, and they simply decided in the seller's favor. Giving me no option to return the item?

Ebay,Global top rated seller useless?,"I recently got a top rated and power seller badges without actually going for them and thought 'cool, fancy badge and lower fees'. However I noticed the fees were still the same and dug around my seller dashboard. Apparently I am Above standard in the US and top rated globally. 

The reason is because my shipping company is not supported on ebay so it counts as if I ship without tracking. It doesn't affect global rating but will never let me become top rated in the US. 

So is the badge the only benefit I am going to get in this case?",1,5,2015-02-25,EBAY,0.03787067160010338,0.7181426882743835,0.24398663640022278
Ebay,Fellow Job-seekers &amp; eBay Resellers: Do you bring up eBay on your resume or in interviews?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, so if not then I apologize and will gladly post it elsewhere if you tell me where exactly that is, lol. But I am wondering if anyone else here is also doing eBay while looking for a job and if you include anything related to eBay on your resume or bring it up during interviews? I am interviewing for some positions that involve customer service and business skills and do think my customer service and related experience on eBay are relevant and transferable (though these jobs are not for eBay and are for corporate environments), but I'm a new seller and not exactly raking in lots of money yet, though I think I've done well for someone who is brand new. 

There is also a stigma about eBay sellers still, like some of the people I have told about my business assume I'm desperately foraging through dumpsters or selling random trinkets around the house (no, I buy low and resell at a profit). Maybe I'm grasping at straws too much here but I spend a lot of time doing stuff for my eBay business and just wish I could somehow professionally bring up those skills if they'll at all help me to get a job. I'm just not sure if it's better to ""hide"" that I spend a lot of my time on eBay, as it is a substantial portion of my work (I also have other part-time jobs) but I fear employers will laugh me out of the office if I attempt to bring up my little side business.

so i decided to buy him a replacement, it is now on the way to him but earlier the buyer messaged me saying he wants to return the item because he have been waiting patiently for the strap.....lets hear it again....waiting for the STRAP. 
the cost of returning the item will cost more than buying a new strap plus also the fact that i have purchased a replacement which is on the way to him.

he said he is going to open a ""not as describe case""  tonight....

Ebay,Clothing purchase issue,"So I bought a suit on ebay and I'm not sure how I should handle my situation. The listing was very brief. It only had one, unhelpful picture and a short description. The description said ""Used once, nice suit, EUC"" and the listing had the size and material details in the item specifications box. When I got the suit, I noticed that the trousers had been improperly hemmed. They had been hemmed carelessly and in a way that visibly damaged the pant legs. I took the pants to my tailor to get his thoughts. He confirmed that the hemming was done poorly and that the pant legs were damaged. He also said that there wasn't any way for him to hide or repair the damage.
Now, the damage is not extremely visible or in a area people are going to be looking at. But it is certainly visible enough that it can be seen at a distance and it doesn't look good.

Ebay,UPDATE: Seller rating dropped due to defects from cancellations on stolen packages. Ebay promises to remove defects.,"EDIT - Additional update 3 days later. The defects were NOT removed, and I called ebay back to find out why. This new representative told me they couldn't be removed because the cancellations were initiated by me and not by the seller. This is not information the first rep didn't know, so this is bullshit.

I was asked to update on my situation, which was posted here:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/2wqd5i/10yr_account_1200_100_positive_feedback_one_bad/

I called ebay today and I explained the situation to them. Only only hold for about 25 minutes for the estimated 4 minute wait time, by the way. ;)

My primary points of interest were:

* Account has 100% positive feedback for 10 years, including the last month.
* The cancellations were due to packages being stolen off of my porch while waiting for pickup, which was out of my control.
* I would be unable to use hundreds of dollars of pending funds in my paypal account to pay my ebay seller fees.

The woman spent time looking at the defects and SHOCKINGLY she agreed to remove them!

She said that it was obviously a one-time situation, and that since it was out of my control I shouldn't be penalized. She said I should expect my seller rating to be adjusted within 48 hours, and for the actual defects to disappear from my account by next Thursday's report.

I assume that after that happens I will have to call paypal and ask them to manually release the funds that are currently on hold, and direct them to the fact that the seller rating is back up to Above Standard. I doubt they will automatically be released once the change takes place.

I admit I am in complete shock over this turn of events. I didn't for a second think my call would be successful. Then again I guess I won't now for absolutely sure for another 48 hours.",6,4,2015-02-26,EBAY,0.3443310558795929,0.6339815258979797,0.021687429398298264

Ebay,How to prevent against scams as a first time seller?,"I've recently moved home and had some electrical stuff I no longer need so I decided to sell it on eBay. I successfully sold 2 old laptops for a total of $460 to 2 different buyers both located in different states.

After being paid (which PayPal are still holding) I packaged both laptops and sent them off the next day. A couple of days later I get this message from 1 of the buyers:

""hi,just to let you know when my son opened his birthday gift it was damaged. we are very unhappy about this and he is very upset please refund or pay for repair"":

When I got this message I was really surprised because I made sure the package was really secure by packaging the laptop in its original box, wrapping layers of bubble wrap around the box, then placing that box into a bigger box that was packed with foam pellets.

Here was my original reply to the buyer:

""Hey [name]! I'm really sorry about that, can you send me a picture of the damage so I can take a look at it myself to see what could have caused it?

Thanks, [My name].""

A day after sending him that reply he sends me this:

""hi. we got this repaired. the screen was smashed so can you pay $60 to cover my cost or please refund. thanks.""

So right now I don't know what to do and feel like I've been pushed into a corner. I sold the laptop to him for $140 so after eBay, PayPal and UPS have taken their fee's I'm only left with $90, if I have to give him $60 I'd have sold the laptop for less than 30 bucks.

The other buyer is also claiming I did not include the battery to the laptop (which I'm 100% positive that I did) and he also wants money to buy a new battery otherwise he will file a dispute.

How should I deal with this? If I have to issue refunds I stand to lose over $100 so I would like to sort this out before it gets to that stage. It just seems to me that because I'm a new seller I'm being targeted by buyers who know they will probably get their money back from PayPal.",2,3,2015-02-27,EBAY,0.03719879314303398,0.9102882742881775,0.052512917667627335

Ebay,[Help] I sold a pair of shoes I have never worn. Buyer insists it has been worn and is shipping it back. Should I just refund it and call it a day? I feel there is nothing else I can do.,"Title pretty much sums it up. I bought some shoes a couple years ago brand new, unused from another seller on eBay. I just wanted to display it and not wear it. Years go by and I decide then I recently decide to sell it because I need funds. 

I find a buyer. The buyer pays. I ship it out. Then the buyer says 'Do you think I would not notice?' and describes the damages. He also mentions something about tracking not updating (Probably not relevant, maybe just wants me to feel worse)

Well, I'm new to selling but I've successfully sold 6 other pairs of used shoes and 4 other gadgets before this problematic buyer. Now I don't know what to do.

Should I just accept the return and refund his money? I have never worn the shoes before and I always thought they were never worn. But the damages he mentioned were minute signs of wear. So I may have actually not seen it.

Also does this mean I'll get a negative on my feedback if he returns it? That's a bummer.

It may even be a scam and the buyer is going to return some beater shoes. I guess its the risk in selling.

Sorry, long post. Just a little confused and dazed.

EDIT 1: I Googled the buyers name and address. There was a NikeTalk thread about the buyer receiving shoes and then reporting suspicious activity. I'm worried

EDIT 2: I called Ebay support to see what I should do. They said go through with the return. The buyer must start a return through ebay. Or a return ticket or something. I forget. 

EDIT 3: I told the buyer to do that return ticket thing through ebay, but they said Ebay isn't issuing the refund. I am. Doesn't he still have to press Return Item on Ebay? Or is it because I clicked 'No Returns Accepted' it's not showing up on the buyers side. 

EDIT 4: We are just handling the return over ebay messages. I am waiting for the shoes, and once it arrives I will cancel the order and issue the refund.

Thank you everyone who helped.

Ebay,Question about buyers ability to request money back,"So I sold my iPod to somebody in Michigan recently for $55. I packed it up, but while I was doing so, I noticed that the home button was being a little finicky, as it does sometimes, especially when it gets cold. I added a note on my packing slip the issue with the home button, that it was a temporary issue and to not worry about it.  I then shipped it, and it arrived a few days later. 

Now, I get an email from the buyer, saying that if they knew the button wasn't working properly, they wouldn't have bought it or have paid as much as they did. They said that if they did not receive a response soon, they would have to request a refund. So I sent them an email back offering a discount on the purchase price.

Here are my questions:

-What do they mean by requesting a refund? I said no returns on my listing. 

-Can they get their money back from me?

-How do I fix this problem? I want them to be happy, but I really can't accept returns on this item. Is the discount I am offering actually an option?

Ebay,Would you have blocked this guy like I have?,"I just want to make sure I'm not overreacting.   
  
So I get this user who messages me with 20 questions about my listing.  So I do my usual quick background check on a potential buyer that messages me and I see this guy has 500 feedback.  I was slightly relieved until I saw he hasn't sold anything for over a year.  
  
Three of his recent feedbacks were negs and from how he responded he was either an ass or stupid.  One if his responses to an inr neg was ""have USPS paper work that item was mailed out, deal with the USPS not me"".  Another neg a buyer left him because he won the auction and never heard from the seller about the local pick up, his response was ""bid page stated first person that pays me gets the tickets.............."";  yeah... that's not how auctions work.  
  
I blocked him for those feedback alone and then I really felt justified when I read some of the feedback he left for others.  First, he leaves waaay more negative feedback than I'm comfortable with.  Every page has at least 1, but mostly 2 - 4 negs he left.  One said he got a refund and he still left a neg, the sellers response was that he bent over backwards to satisfy this guy and he still left a neg.  Other negs are either very nitpicky or he didn't contact the sellers for resolution.  
  
So what do you guys think, am I over reacting or am I dodging a bullet here?  I think the amount of negs he's leaving along given the time period is enough justification for me.  If you have that many problems with other people, the issue is usually you, not the rest of the world.
