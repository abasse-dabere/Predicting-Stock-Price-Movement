Ebay,"My buyer isn't reaching out to me, even after I messaged him. What should I do?","I sold an item a day ago, my buyer specifically said I should message him through his email with my paypal link and the complete info on the item (couldn't fit all the pictures without paying, I guess that's what he meant).

I messaged him through his email twice, and through an invoice on eBay, and I have still yet to receive an answer.

I don't mind waiting a bit to see if he answers, but in a case where he does not, can I put my item back to sell? And also, should the buyer really ask for my paypal? Isn't he supposed to pay through eBay?",6,7,2016-05-01,EBAY,0.03196781501173973,0.9218092560768127,0.04622291401028633
Ebay,Picture help,"Hello everyone,

I am curious how you all make your pictures with such high light saturation ( I realize the easy answer is get more light, I'm more looking for specifics). I have been told using the flash is bad. I tried using a shop light but I end up with light lines on my products. Do you all have any tips to help a relatively new ebayer make his pictures better. I use an IPhone 6+ for my pictures and I'm not really interested in purchasing a dedicated camera for putting pictures on eBay. Any tips anyone has would be greatly appreciated.

Ebay,Removing sellers positive false/angry feedback?,"Yes you read that right. With eBay only allowing sellers to leave buyers (me) positive feedback, the seller left me positive feedback which read:

- won an item and paid for it
- seller is with ebays GSP and doesn't recognize the address 
- seller cancels my transaction &gt; i get refund 
- seller contacts me and says he can ship it if i paypal gift him the payment &gt; i decline as i would have no buyer coverage

Ebay,"Package I sent out four days ago says ""in transit,"" but still in same town.

I mailed three small packages on Thursday. Two of them have money available in paypal soon, but the 3rd still has the availability set to almost two weeks from now. So, I checked the tracking, and sure enough, the package hasn't even left town yet.

Ebay,Someone bidding from a region I don't ship to.,"I had a bidder message me today asking if I could ship to his zipcode through USPS Priority Mail instead of UPS Ground. I looked up his zip code and it's in Hawaii.

Not only do I have my account set to not ship to Hawaii, but I also have my buyer restrictions set to not accept bids from people in regions I don't ship to. So how is this guy bidding? 

What bothers me is that he's bidding competitively with my other top bidder. If he wins, what the hell do I do? I messaged him back saying that I wasn't sure what's going on, but his bids should not have been accepted in the first place because of the restrictions I have set in place. I explained things to him nicely, so hopefully he accepts my answer and stops bidding.

If I cancel his bids will it affect the bids of the other bidder? It has only been these 2 going back and forth. I think if I was going back and forth with one bidder for hours, and all the sudden that person's bids all went away, I'd wonder if it was actually the seller with another account trying to get my bid higher, or something else fishy going on.

Ebay,Need advice about a problem with delivery,"So I sold a video game on April 10th and I sent it out the same day. A few days later, I checked the tracking and it said that the package was ""Undeliverable as Addressed"". I then messaged the buyer asking him if he had experienced this with his address before, and he responded by saying ""I recently moved and forgot to change my address on eBay."" At this point I was a little annoyed but did not respond as I was waiting for the item to be returned before I give him the option of paying for shipping (I listed it with free shipping but since it was his fault I was going to charge him to reship) or offer him a full refund.

After a week, the item still hadn't been returned. I called USPS customer service and they opened a case. Later that day, I received a call from the investigator telling me that the post office that was unable to deliver the package was not answering the phone. I tell them to just keep me updated. The next day, I get another phone call saying that they have emailed that post office and the investigator has yet to get a reply. They also said that the package it still there and has not been lost or prepared to be sent back. It's just sitting there.

I'm confused about what to do. Should I offer the refund now, and wait for the problem to resolve without the customer? I did send them an email notifying them that I was trying to figure out what was going on. My problem is that originally, it was the buyer's fault for giving me the wrong address.

Ebay,Is there a worthwhile e-mail contact regarding appeals and collections?,"As a seller I lost an appeal despite an item arriving with signature confirmation. In short, I had to ship from PA to HI and unfortunately the delivery was delayed by USPS and arrived late. While in transit the buyer opened a not received case.

Within 24 hours of the case being opened I uploaded the tracking information. Buyer also had tracking prior which showed the item was in transit.

Ebay still ruled in favor of the buyer and charged me the price of the item to issue him a refund. The very next day the item arrived and again I even had signature confirmation along with the tracking. That day I filed an appeal as the tracking showed proof of delivery and confirmation. I still lost the appeal and still owe the money. Now I'm out the item and money.

First time I call ebay I spoke to someone who barely spoke English and didn't understand what was going on. 2nd call they tell me to contact the buyer. I did and of course he won't return my call. 3rd call they tell me to contact PayPal, passing blame now and PayPal unsurprisingly says they have nothing to do with it. Final call, they tell me it's too late to do anything. The woman told me she couldn't pull up the tracking information, but I'm still able to access it.

I'm wondering if there's an e-mail I could use to submit all of the documentation I have and hopefully speak with someone higher up. It makes no sense for me to have to pay this and have my account suspended when I did everything within guidelines.

Ebay,[x-post from /r/paypal] eBay Buyer has requested a refund due to a false claim,"I sold a laptop on eBay that had use on the top and bottom. I stated accurately that the top and bottom had scratches and made no mention of anything else. There was also a lock on the MEBX system which I did not remember the password to so I sold it ""As-is"". 


The buyer is now requested a refund due to ""light scratches"" on the screen claiming he would not have bought the item if he had known about them. Thing is, there is nothing on the screen. I have [not-so-great photo proof of it](http://imgur.com/a/olOqH), but it is a shot of the entire screen while the buyer's photos are tiny close-ups shown [here](http://imgur.com/a/wIr5j). I know for a fact that there were no scratches like that or else I would have taken a closer picture of the screen to show them. I didn't think of taking close-ups to show that there weren't.


I've replied to the return request with the photo proof but I've heard enough PayPal horror stories with them siding with the buyer and I'm worries. Anything I can do the help my case? Or am I basically screwed?

EDIT: I'm seeing online that the best course of action at this point would be to either accept the return (but I will have to pay return shipping?) or offer a partial refund. What should I do?

Ebay,"Hidden charges, do they charge non store, sellers an extra dollar for a 3 day auction? (Newbie here)","I had listed a few 3 day auctions in my recent listings, just wanted to get the things out the door cause I had done it that way in the past. So then I find out my account has been charged for $15 for all those listings; some items were re listed. So I called for explanation and the lady refers me to one of this page with their guidelines 

if you scroll half way down it says:

""Auction style listings (all durations)""
Free""

But if you go to the bottom of that table (3/4 down the page) it says: 

""use of 1 or 3 day listings.....$1""

So the lady on the phone is trying to tell me that the $1 policy is a new policy that changed recently. I told her this is BS the top of the page says any duration is free. So she credited me with $15, took that off my charges. my questions: 

1) is this really a new policy or is she trying to BS me/
2) Are there any other likely hidden fee charges that i am likely to encounter?

Like I said she was nice enuf to take the charges off, so thanks ebay. I am mainly putting this out there to warn other people",23,1,2016-05-04,EBAY,0.023456290364265442,0.9234011173248291,0.053142596036195755

Ebay,Sellers: Who has made the switch from no returns to offering returns? Would you tell me about your experience?,"When we started selling on eBay a year ago, we fully expected it to be backup to our physical location and more of an afterthought than anything.  Back then, we didn't sell enough to warrant offering returns, discount on fees or not.

Since then, eBay has kind of blown up for us.  We've gone from ~5 items a week to 30-50 a day (42 this morning, w00t!).  We got to looking at our return rate and realized that it's actually pretty low.  The amount we would save with the 20% discount on fees MORE than covers what returns we did have, and since most of them had to lie to force it through, the items we received back were resellable - granted, at a slightly lower value and minus shipping, but that brings our losses from returns even lower.

This got us to thinking - how many more returns would we receive if we allowed them?  We're under 2% now, and I know it'd go up, but how significantly?  On the other hand, how much will it increase sales?  Plus, the ability to collect restocking fees and not have to pay return postage every time adds to our profits.

I'm completely aware of the usual variables, YMMV with different products/sale styles/regions, but anybody who could share their experience with this decision (positive or negative) would have my appreciation.  This is like the summer job that turned into a career, and it's funding my nursing school so it's pretty important to us!

Thoughts:
I initially didn't like it but after using it today for a few hours I think it's much faster and cut out a lot of uploading photos time. I really like that it will save my last item description which makes for easier bulk listing. I also like that you can save item description templates, I just am not sure on whether there is a limit to those yet or not. 

One thing I don't like is the general look and feel of it but I think it will grow on me and the amount of time I am saving already will make for a much better eBay experience.

Ebay,My eBay scammer was arrested....,"Hello everyone.  I've been reading this sub since February, I came across it after I was scammed for a ~$xxx item..

I won't give too much detail since the case is still open, but I'll say it was an electronic item, and the buyer wanted to return it because he claimed he ""ordered the wrong item"".  Without hesitation I approved the return.  But after doing so, I started looking at his feedback and noticed he'd had many 'problems' with transactions in the 1.5 years he's been on eBay.

So, as expected, he returned an identical but non functional item which had a different serial number.  I posted photos to the 'return item' eBay conversation and kindly asked (without making accusations) to send the correct unit back for a refund.  Not much longer after that, eBay processed his full refund and closed the case.  Also as expected, I didn't get anywhere with customer service over the phone.  They processed the refund because the USPS tracking showed the box was delivered.

So, I filed a report with USPS Mail Fraud, and also the IC3 site.  After that, I called my local (small town) police department and they took a report.  I provided detailed photos showing the difference between the items.

I provided the USPS, IC3, and police report #'s to eBay hoping they would look in to the case again, they simply said 'keep calling the buyer and see what you can work out'.  Ugh.  

A couple weeks later, my local PD followed up to see if I got anywhere with eBay.  (No where)  At that point he considered this a loss (theft), so he forwarded the case information to the local (small town) PD where the buyer lives.

A couple days later, a detective called me to say he had received the case, and we talked on the phone a bit to verify some details.  I also provided link to high resolution photos of the items, and a video of me unboxing the return item.  He said he'd look into it.

Two days later, he emailed me to say that he executed a search warrant at the scammers home, located my item, and that he will be charging the person with theft.  I can get my item back after the case is closed.   OMG!

So, just thought I would post my story in case there are others out there wondering what to do.  If the buyer were in a big city, I doubt the police would have taken it that far.  I was actually quite surprised.  To be a fly on the wall in his house when that all went down......

I've been a seller since 1998, but not as a store just personal items.  I still sell items, but now I attach tamper proof labels that are numbered.  They are clearly shown in the listing and I have specific instructions on returns.  (Not that it matters to the big time scammers, but maybe it's at least somewhat of a deterrent)

**UPDATE 5/8/16:**  Thanks for the feedback so far.  I promise to give an update after the case is concluded.  There is a pre-trial conference about 2 weeks out.  According to the online docket for the case, he's not represented by an attorney, at least not yet.  This will likely end up resulting in a pre-trial deferment, based on how other similar theft cases concluded in his county.  Once things are wrapped up I'll request copies of the probable cause affidavit, return on search warrant, etc, and post them here.  (With identifying information redacted to comply with the doxxing / no personal information rule.)

**UPDATE 5/25/16:**  Not much of an update besides that he has retained an attorney, who appeared on his behalf yesterday.  Next appearance is on June 27th and I'll provide another update.  

&gt;On May 23, 2016, Attorney XXX appeared and indicated his intention to file written appearance for and on behalf of Defendant.

By that I mean that there is the original price in a foreign currency, and there is the converted value in USD when you view the listing, but if you view the item in your watch list it will take the already converted USD total from the listing, treat that as the original price, then convert again into USD and show the result of the second conversion.  For instance, if an item is $30 GBP, right now it's roughly $43 USD.  Add that item to your watch list and it will show as roughly $62 USD.  Hover over that price and it will say Starting Bid GBP: $43 - the already once-converted price.

I'm mentioning it here because it can effect how people choose to bid on items on their watch list.  In the example I used, the price is off by nearly 50% as a result, so it's certainly worth knowing about.",2,2,2016-05-06,EBAY,0.034049589186906815,0.9197877645492554,0.046162668615579605

Ebay,Item Suddenly Returned to Seller - What recourse do I have in terms of shipping fees?,"So I sold an item and shipped it by printing a USPS shipping label through eBay. Buyer's address was confirmed and I didn't edit it at all.

When it got to the buyer's local post office, it suddenly stated returned to sender. From contacting USPS, they said that the system just says the address was undeliverable. However, I asked for them to investigate the exact reason why as the tracking never updated stating they needed a address update or anything like that.

Anyways, now that it's coming back to me, is there anything I can do to get my shipping fees back? 

In addition, I will be contacting that USPS office where it was last marked as return to sender in the hopes that someone there might recall why it was returned.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Edit: I suspect the buyer requested them to return it or refused delivery as the buyer contacted me saying he wanted to cancel it right after I shipped it.

Ebay,"Unsure what to do, help?","I'll keep this as short as I can, may fail.

Ok, so I bought an expensive-ish item in England, the seller didn't communicate with me until today when I asked if he had shipped it yet. Thing is, he's posted it 10 days after payment, amd he's using eBays' global shipping service which is notorius for taking up to twice as long to arrive as regular post. This would mean my items may not get here until 6 weeks after payment, which is well past the month you have to claim an item hasnt been sent and file a refund claim. And I cant leave feedback after a month either. He has 100% feedback, but I'm a bit suss that hes trying to screw me, duebto the poor communication. He claims he was away, but unless he was in the jungle he would have been able to flick me a message. Should I claim my item hasnt been received if it hasn't arrived by the claim cutoff, or trust this guy? 

Also my info on refund claims and such may be dated, I haven't used eBay much these last few years. I don't wanna screw this guy out of a decent chunk of change, but at the same time I'm worried that I'm going to get screwed myself.

Ebay,(UK) Hermes.,"I won a jumper and the item was sent to me by seller through Hermes. The item was not received but Hermes has on file that the item has delivered to the customer with a signature. I definitely did not sign for the item and there's no one else to have signed for it. 

This is the second time something like this has happened with Hermes. About two months ago they left an item which I had won sitting on my front door step (so they say). The item was not on my front porch when I returned home that day the parcel was not  on my doorstep (surprise, surprise). 
The seller would not cooperate and when I filed a complaint Ebay found against me because, well, Hermes had shown the item had been delivered.

Ebay,Is it appropriate to leave a negative feedback??,"First post was removed due to my throwaway being new so here I am on my only other account used for porn.

I bought this laptop on ebay and received it 2 days ago It was advertised to have the Adobe cs6 suite installed along with Microsoft office.

The issue is that the software was pirated, they left a folder containing the crack files for adobe and a program to active office sitting on the desktop. Normally I would be fine with this as whatever its just software I realy dont need/want.


The real problem comes today when I started the laptop this morning and as was greeted with an updating screen. After the update completes the laptop is no longer activated and refuses to activate. I was fine with pirated software but a pirated OS is kinda at the point where I'm annoyed at the seller.
I would normally try to contact the seller but my 3 attempts asking for a proper working shipping number were met with silence so I doubt he would respond now.

Ebay,"Buyer files INAD, I accept and let them keep item. Item was then resold. Can I do anything?","Long story short, last month a buyer messages me asking if they could buy two high end ladies Blazers for a discount together. I agreed and gave her a good deal. $1200 Blazers that don't resell well, so she got both for $90 including shipping (they were listed at $45 and $55 plus shipping).

Somehow my account settings changed to allow automatic returns. Buyer got both Blazers and initiated INAD. It was auto accepted, and I've never denied one because it's a lost cause. Buyer claims damage that I know wasn't there, rendering it unsellable to me if I had her send it back. So I let her keep it, and gave a full refund. 6 hours later, she did the same thing on the second item.

It's a month later, and earlier today I was browsing sold listings on the same brand... And I randomly see one of the Blazers I sold to her. Saw it was being shipped from the same tiny town the buyer lived in, very similar username. No way it's a coincidence, despite same location and username, it's not a well known brand and there aren't ANY Blazers similar to mine active or sold, let alone same size.

I've realized that I need to stop allowing buyers to keep the item in the case of a return, even when they claim damage that would make the item garbage for me. But in this case, it's clear the buyer used a side account, bought my item and intentionally scammed me for a refund knowing it would cost too much for return shipping.

I know it's unlikely, but is there anything I can do? She sold the item that I gave a full refund on ($45) and resold it the other day for $150, listed as being in mint condition. Clearly she lied about the damage. It's not so much about the money, but the idea that she sells in such high volume on her selling account and surely I'm not the only person she's done this to. Is there any point in contacting ebay, or should I just let it go?

Ebay,Possible to become a distributor of branded products?,"So in short,

Started selling my old stuff. Did well. But I wanted consistent inventory. Started online arbitrage. It sucks because everyone sources the same product, only thing I can change is price. Price War pretty much ends and had to liquidate everything. Started importing from China. Ends up there are tons of direct from factory China selling on eBay and Amazon. So that option is dead as well. Way back in the past I tried to become a distributor of a legit brand like Sony. Panasonic, but I realized they want to see a physical storefront. The second you say EBay and Amazon, they cut you off.

Ebay,Selling to competitors - yay or nay?,"Just had one of my mid-range competitors (there are a few that up them in the ranking, but not by much) send me offers on a large number of my items - 25 of this, 10 of that, etc.  The offers are reasonable (although I will likely haggle on a couple of them), probably $300-400 total.  The first offer was made on the competitors selling account, then was retracted and all of the offers came in on what I am guessing is their buying account.  I too have a buying account that is separate from my selling account, so that's not unusual.

Question is: if this guy is truly out to sabotage me in some way (I'm not saying they are, I'm not saying they aren't), how seriously does eBay take these issues?  Are they as lax as everyone else?  I think it's kind of strange that after a year of selling the same products, they're suddenly buying up my stock the day after I switch to offering returns.  Maybe I'm paranoid.

EDIT: I had sent a message asking about the switch in accounts, trying to open a dialogue with them.

Ebay,Should I trust this seller?,"Hello, /r/ebay.

I recently bought a Macbook Pro from a seller with 99.5% feedback. The Macbook was $1500 retail, but the seller was selling it for $1199 brand new. I bought it Monday, May 2nd and the seller stated in the description she can only ship on Fridays. Friday, May 6th came and she didn't ship, so I contacted her and she said her plane landed late, as she is a business traveller. She stated she would ship Monday priority mail. Monday came and I didn't receive any tracking information or item marked as shipped, so I contacted her again and she said she did ship. 

This made me worry, so I went a little deeper into her feedback only to find her trying to selling the same Macbook Pro in the past couple of months. The feedback left for these were positive and neutral, stating ""Feedback left in error. Feel confident to buy from"" and ""Seller was responsive to communication"", respectively. 

Looking at her other items for sale they didn't specify they had to be shipped on Fridays. She has two items in the past year that were never received from the buyer. She responded to this feedback stating she did ship.

I still have until May 16th to receive the item before I can open a case that I never did receive it. Should I worry or am I overanalyzing this?",2,7,2016-05-10,EBAY,0.08874945342540741,0.861492931842804,0.049757588654756546

So far it's been a week or 5 business days and not only has the tracking not been updated since it had been delivered, the cards haven't shown up. It's not that far because they're return from Florida to New Hampshire.

A few notes - USPS says the delivery was denied, I am a moron and did not add insurance (yes I am an idiot to answer your question), USPS says they don't have any additional info on the return shipment, and my questions is that how the hell would the buyer know that the cards were damaged if he denied the shipment because the package was damaged?

Ebay,"Sold two identical smartphones to the same guy, but I made a mistake on my shipping label and had to void it, now ebay acts like there are two packages for the seller and I'm paranoid","Sorry for the dumb questions.


Basically, title says it all. I thought I had a regional box but I didn't after all and had to void the original label. When I bought a new label it just added another tracking number on to the order so when I go check my order details it shows one phone shipping with one tracking number, and the other phone with the other tracking number. This is really frustrating because there's no way to remove the voided label. 


I've had bad luck in the past so I'm worried the buyer could take advantage of this and say they got one device.. far fetched but they have 0 feedback which bugged me from the start. Also, my first label was double the weight of the second because I was lazy and didn't need to be precise as the price was the same, but since I picked a different method the second time around I had to put in the exact weight.


I think my assumptions are a bit over the top, but can anyone give me some peace of mind. If, hypothetically, this seller was out to screw me, could he use my mistake against me? Is there any way to prove that both phones are in the one box and not two separate boxes like ebay says?

Ebay,I've listed a digital item on eBay. The current only bidder is has a buyer score of 0. Should I be worried?,"First off, I know eBay doesn't support transfers of digital goods. In that sense I'm aware I'm basically fully responsible for this transaction and can't depend on eBay should it escalate.

What I am selling is a *very* loaded European account for a popular online game. I estimate it to be worth â¬200 dollars at least, possibly â¬300. However the current highest bidder is based in Mexico, has a buyer score of 0, and seems to have made a collection of listings similar to mine when I go to his profile.

Now it's possible to transfer accounts if they pay a fee to the game company, so in that sense him being from Mexico isn't a dealbreaking red flag. It's everything else combined with that (two month old account, following similar listings, 0 buyer score) that have got my spidey senses tingling. 

Should I be worried? Can I decline selling the account to this person if he ends up winning the auction? I really don't want to take any chances with buyers like these.

Ebay,"Buyer was incommunicado regarding return, ebay ruled in my favor. Item arrived hours later.","[I posted about this this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/4j6uju/buyer_initiated_a_return_how_long_do_they_have_to/) and, following your guys' excellent advice, contacted ebay. They sent me the buyer's phone number, which I called to no answer, and called ebay again. They checked in their system and found that they saw no evidence the buyer had printed the shipping label I'd sent, and so they ruled in my favor and closed the case; I no longer have the issue refund button even available to me, at least not where I'm used to seeing it.

And of course a few hours later the return miraculously appears in the mail. Now I'm unsure what to do. Do I call ebay and ask them to reopen the return so I can issue the refund? I *want* to say ""tough luck, should have been more prompt or at least in-communication regarding delays"" regarding it all and not bother with it, but I imagine the buyer may be able to open a case via PayPal or something, I'm not sure. Regardless, I just want this buyer out of my life, this process has been dragging on for six+ weeks now.  I figure if I just *send* her a refund without going through ebay, there will be no proof and I may have to double-refund her down the line if she's as unscrupulous as she is slow. What is my best course of action?

**TL;DR** Buyer took a month to return an item, didn't communicate at all in the process (including phone call), didn't print the label I sent through ebay so that the item could be confirmed as shipped. Ebay ruled in my favor and closed the case, then the item arrived. Do I refund her, 
#and if so, how?


Edited to add: A lot of people are talking about ""the right thing"" ethically. I don't care either way, TBH. Ethically you don't sit on an item for weeks, then report a problem, then take weeks to actually ship it, then not communicate about the delays. It's rude to the other person who has been prompt and courteous and specifically asked you to be prompt in return.

But I also don't care enough to stiff someone on principle, so I'd happily give the refund, but the point is that even if I did go with the refund, I don't know how to do it, so unless the little man on my shoulder can walk me through that process, please be sure to include information that will actually help me do this ""right"" thing you speak of without being double charged, which is my worry that I spoke of in the original post.",10,9,2016-05-14,EBAY,0.06107538193464279,0.9135807156562805,0.025343913584947586

I couldn't remember my password so about 3 days ago I reset it then I put the item on my watch list until the last day (today) where I went to try and make a bid.

I keep having wrong items sent or other mistakes happen,  it's due to the increase in shipments and the fact I'm not used to the volume. 

So I purchased a separate desk area so now I have a spot to do all my shipping,  before I was doing everything on a tiny desk (very cluttered). 

Does anybody have a method for handling large volume shipments which works good for them?

Ebay,"Trying to sell a laptop, scams are coming in non-stop","I sold approximately $10,000 worth of equipment on eBay several years ago over a long stretch and had a very high rating, however I haven't sold anything in about 5 years, and when I went to log in my account was gone and now I'm forced to start back at zero with a new account. I'm trying to sell my wifes laptop, and the first time I had several people message me directly offering to buy it for a check or asking me directly for my paypal account. I know better than to fall for these scams, and just ignored them, but I wasn't expecting the auction to end the way it did. This is a 2011 MacBook Pro which should sell for $450-600 based on other auctions I've seen. At the last minute two bidders drove the price up to $2600. I had no idea what to think, until about 5 hours after the auction ended, I received a message from the buyer saying they had made a mistake, but they would still pay me $1000 and would send the check directly to me, I only needed to provide my paypal account and cell phone number....

I have to mail in proof via actual mail, because the post office apparently can't handle digital information.

I have to ask, would you please close the case and then reopen it when I have been refunded so that I may refund you?

Ebay,Dealing with a deceitful buyer,"I sold an expensive piece of electronics a month ago.  I listed the item as no-returns and made it very clear in the description that the manufacturer is responsible because the item was brand-new and still sealed, I'm not running an eBay store.

I also have text messages from the jerk saying things like ""The ball's in my court now, pay me $1000 or I'll take it all when eBay sides with me"" trying to extort money from me.

eBay doesn't want to see any of my evidence, nor take my 10+ years of 100% positive feedback into account.

Ebay,Opening a case after leaving positive feedback,"I'm mostly a buyer on eBay and have 100% positive feedback.  I purchased a book that was listed for $2 after getting approved for $1 offer, $4 shipping.  The seller approved the offer within minutes. 
Days later it still hasn't shipped and the item has been listed with next day shipping so I asked when they thought it would ship out and they told me their mom just died and it had shipped the week before (it had only been a few days).  Seller later told me it had shipped, updated it with a tracking number that didn't work.

USPS sucks a lot of the time so I assumed this was true. The item DID arrive a couple of days ago and it was still within a reasonable time and the book is readable so I left positive feedback.  I don't know why I left it so quickly since I usually wait until I've actually used the item.  **My problem/question** is that the book has no dust jacket, is separated from the spine, the spine is squished, and there are red markings from a bookmark inside but it was listed as ""very good.""  I just bought it based on the two pictures which showed none of this (except no dust jacket) and the price which I still consider to be reasonable.

Ebay,"Sold phone, Buyer Claims IMEI is Blacklisted (It's not)","Hey there,

So a little while ago I sold a cell phone on ebay. The phone was purchased full retail price and so it wasn't tied to any EIP contract or any of that stuff.

Three or so weeks after the sale, the guy opens a return request and says

""Dear seller, I am very disappointed with this item. Since I have receive the item, I am not able to make a call, I found out that the item is blacklisted and is not able to work. I would like to return item for a full refund.""

I made sure to save the IMEI # before I sent the phone, so I took the IMEI and checked it on several IMEI sites as well as calling T-Mobile (which is what kind of phone it was) and none of them say that it's blacklisted.

I'm thinking two things, either he assumed the device was unlocked when he bought it, or he's attempting to scam me.

From this point, I replied to him that I checked to ensure the IMEI wasn't blacklisted and posted a picture of the IMEI being checked on swappa's IMEI checker.

What else can I do to protect myself? Is this likely to go in the buyer's favor even if it's clear he's full of it? 

**Update**: I decided to let e-Bay decide the result of the case. I posted a picture of Swappa's IMEI checker showing the IMEI as well as a T-Mobile live chat log showing the IMEI wasn't blocked as well as a picture of the phone's box with the IMEI showing.

They decided in my favor and rejected the return.",7,5,2016-05-18,EBAY,0.06495963782072067,0.9085878133773804,0.026452552527189255

""The return is not a problem; however because there is nothing wrong with the device and the issue is with your network, there is a 15% restock fee to cover all my expenses and shipping costs, and you are responsible for the return shipping costs back to me.

Ebay,$0.40 charge for an item I listed and didn't sell from 4 years ago?,"As the title says, I got an email from ebay telling me first that my account might be being used fraudulently. For reference, I have not used my ebay account for many years(over 4 at this point). As precaution I changed my password anyway since it was linked to my paypal.

Decided to check my account summary and saw that I had a charge of 40 cents on my account. The last time I listed an item on Ebay was 4 years ago, and that item did not sell. However it was not a scheduled listing, and it does not even show up in my currently listed items, but rather only in my history, stating that it was put up for sale in Jan 2012.

Maybe there is something I missed, but my recent transactions are empty, yet I still have the random 40 cent charge.

Ebay,"Duplicate order by mistake, seller won't cancel.

Ebay,Help!! Newbie seller and unwanted/suspicious international buyer.,"I just ""sold"" my first item on ebay.  The listing said 

""Item location: XXX, United States
Shipping to: United States
Excludes: Alaska/Hawaii, US Protectorates, APO/FPO, PO Box""

I assumed this was enough to limit me to US buyers.

The ""buyer"" is a brand new account, based in Turkey.  The sale notification included a U.S. zip code.  I assume they really want it shipped to Turkey or it's a scam.  (If they're in the US, why would their *brand new* account say Turkey.)

I used a cancel button (one of they choices said ""problem with the buyer's address"") and it said something like ""You've agreed to cancel the order, the buyer has 10 days to agree.""  I used the cancel button without contacting the buyer.

Now I have an email that says ""If the buyer paid for this order, you should refund the order total and any shipping costs. Weâll ask the buyer to confirm they received the refund.""

What do I do?  Do I contact the buyer now?  Am I too suspicious?  Is it OK if it's a US ship address?  I was going to require a signature with shipping.  It's about $900 worth of electronics.

Ebay,"I just got robbed, and eBay is all Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯.

About 2 weeks after delivery of said lot BadDad opens a case on eBay, claiming ""the item is broken/defective"". Despite my requests for more information, BadDad does not respond. eBay ultimately rules in favor of the buyer, BadDad, who then prints off a return label and mails it to me on a small, empty envelope (via USPS tracking, nonetheless). 

Last week later I discovered that eBay has taken $215 (sale + s/h) from my account to ""reimburse"" BadDad. When I called eBay and reported the situation, they tell me there is nothing they can do.

The only thing I can think of is related accounts. There is one related account that is able to sell $2 million a month, and it says that this flagged account may be directly affecting your limit.

Ebay,Do front-end loaded titles work in eBay?.,"Hello /r/Ebay ,

I currently work for a company that does a lot of eBay work (80,000+ Sales, 50,000+ Positive feedback). I have the task of creating the eBay listings and essentially the optimising of listings for cassini and the eBay SERPS.

I have an SEO Background but was wondering if front-loading titles worked as it does with google titles for Cassini. 

Heres an example:

Brand - Model - main features - extra features

SAMSUNG UE60JU6000 Smart 4k 60"" LED TV with Freeview HD

(this is an example if cassini favours this layout)

or

Brand(Only if a searched make) - main features - extra features - model

Samsung 60"" 4K Smart LED TV with Freeview HD - UE60JU6000

(this is the order of ""searched keywords"")

I had read some places that cassini does favour the first layout offering the make and model at the start although I have not confirmed this.

Can any of you guys shed any light on this?.

Ebay,Suggestions on how to handle INAD claim,"Greetings!

I have been an eBay seller for over two years and have sold a few dozen items but so far with relatively little issue.  

Recently, I posted an auction for a men's dress shirt from a French manufacturer.  The shirt is listed as a size ""Medium"" on the tag and was listed as such in the auction.  In the item description, I provided exact measurements and a disclaimer that international sizes do not always line up with American sizes, and a suggestion that the buyer should only purchase if they are comfortable with the measurements provided in the item description and that refunds for fit would not be acceptable.

The buyer of the auction filed a ""item not as described"" refund claim last Sunday, indicating that it does not fit.  His/her words in the claim are that the item was listed as a ""Medium"" but that the item I sent does not fit and is a ""Small"".

I do not have a picture of the tag which indicates the size, but I know what size it was since it was my original purchase and I wear a ""Medium"".

I have not had to deal with this type of claim before so I don't know what happens exactly.  I am definitely not refunding the buyer's money outright or offering a partial refund.  If I accept the return, it appears I have to pay the shipping cost.

Do I have any chance of fighting this, given that my description was provided with complete sizing information?  I feel that it is the buyer's mistake purchasing something that does not fit when I provided full detail of sizing.

It's to the point where I'd rather fight it than lose the shipping cost that I'd have to pay, since I don't feel I'm at fault.",8,3,2016-05-25,EBAY,0.0416414737701416,0.9223212003707886,0.03603736683726311

____________________________________________________________________Original Message_________
Honestly I just want to scream sometimes. 

This buyer first off - got this high end razor system for CHEAP. 
Then buyer uses the product (brand new sealed) for 20 days.
Then buyer files a ""defective"" return request because ""he does not like it""
..... of course avoiding our 10% restocking fee on USED brand new products (which will now just have to be thrown away gross)
and can't even be bothered to at least pay return shipping.

Buyer reported - buyer name and scam posted up on badbuyer.com

Anger still here. 

Seriously.... eBay sucks at protecting the seller. Even when the buyer admits on eBay several times they are NOT following the rules. 

Its a joke. 

But hey - that is what long drawn out returns are for I guess. Sure buddy I will just quickly refund you without returning the item.....

Ebay,"Discussion I had with a friend, looking for others opinions","What's up guys? So a few days ago my friend and I was discussing EBay and how the auctions work. I had noticed that people had been bidding on items several days before the listing would end, which coming from someone who frequently buys on EBay, seemed to make little or no sense. If I see an item I want, I'll simply just Watch it, and then put the maximum I'm willing to pay right before the auction ends. 

Both my friend and I couldn't seem to understand why people would be bidding high amount of money days before an auction ends,  so what're your buying strategies?

Ebay,Blacklisted (lost/stolen) Amazon Echo,"This may be a long shot, but I recently purchased an amazon echo on eBay from a seller who listed it as ""parts/as-is."" He was not able to register it to his amazon account and neither could I. I found out by calling Amazon that Amazon has it listed as lost/stolen. I have contacted the seller and he told me he purchased it form another seller, who in turn purchased it from Craigslist.

I guess my question is, what would be my course of action with this? I have already contacted eBay and Amazon regarding this issue and they both told me that I should go to the police and file out a report in order to get my money back. OR find the original owner and have them tell amazon that it actually isn't lost/stolen.

Has anyone else gone through this that can shed some light?

Ebay,Seller said he would give me a full refund and later says he misspoke about it.,"I ordered an audio interface from this seller. It worked fine at first but then within an hour it makes intermittent buzzing noises. I contacted the seller and said that it was no problem and that he would send me a return label the next day.

Ebay,Chinese seller... should i ask ebay to step in?,"so this is following up on https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/4jq5wx/offered_4_refund_on_15_item/

just some more info, the item costed originally, i think 28 USD (i am no longer sure because of reasons i will soon explain, also this is a 2 piece set)

i was sent the wrong size for part of the order, and sent the seller a message about it, was offered a $4 refund, or i guess a full refund (if only i personally paid international shipping to china)... wasnt really happy with the offer, so i opened a INAD case as recommended in my previous post, and they upped their offer to an $8 refund (not even a 30% refund, or about 60% refund on half the order if you assume the other half is fine)..

i have sent them more messages saying that if they don't give me a reasonable refund, that i will ask ebay to step in... so now, my window to escalate the case ends on the 30th, and i dont think i am getting responses from the seller anymore...

as for not knowing the exact price anymore, for some reason, the item doesn't appear in my purchase history anymore (although a smaller item i purchased with it is still there), so i cant tell what i paid for it now...

i would feel kinda bad, because i get these chinese sellers are usually on pretty thin margins, and etc, etc... what do you guys think, would i win a case if i put this through ebays resolution process?

Ebay,"Item was returned to seller because of ""incorrect number"", ebay ended up ruling in their favor and I won't be given a refund. What can I do?","This has been a long ordeal that's now based more on principle than anything. I've lived at this address for 15 years, receive items daily (and so far about 30 times this year alone from ebay), this is the first shipping issue I've ever had.

The tracking stated that ""no such number"" existed that was printed on the shipping label. USPS then returned it to one of their facilities. This is when I appealed with ebay who then ruled in the seller's favor. I contacted USPS and they tried send the package out again, but same thing ""no such number"". This was about 2 months ago.

The item was finally returned to the sender 2 weeks ago, I tried contact the seller to see what the issue was, whether or not the label was damaged or if they misprint my address. No response.

It's since been more than 30 days after my first appeal, so I believe that I can no longer resubmit another appeal. I just want to know what I can do next?

Again, I've lived here for 15 years and this is the first issue I've ever encountered with receiving any item.

Anyway, I already got the payment redaction email from PayPal, but I was thinking of going ahead and shipping the card anyway so that I have a tracking number and can file a seller protection claim. I mean, I sold him the card, not the code. Right? 

Maybe after I ship I can start a communication with the seller. More than likely he's using a fake address, right? So the letter should be returned to me. Except I don't put a return address on the envelope so it can't. And if he isn't there to receive it he won't be there to ship it back. If he doesn't ship it back then it wasn't a valid refund.

Ebay,Auction automatically revert to 7 days when listing,"Hello everyone,

I have been having a minor annoyance occurs when I am specifying the time period that I want for my listings. For auctions on more expensive items I like to do 10 days and for most BIN I do 30 days but will occasionally do less. My issue is that when I am trying to change the duration when I am initially listing an item I click on it and the page immediately refreshes to the previous amount of time. I have to click in the drop down box my desired duration 3-7 times in order for it to actually stay that way. This may sound trivial but with many listings it can be quite a waste of time.

Ebay,What's the best sob story a buyer has given you to try and get an item cheaper?,"I recently sold my sons modded iPhone. It was immaculate, and had been coloured by modmyi into a gorgeous two tone metallic purple and peacock blue.

Will had it listed for a very reasonable Â£200 or best offer.

I received an offer that night of Â£50, which I just laughed at and clicked decline.

I immediately got an eBay message from the guy, asking me to accept, as it was for his eight year old daughters birthday, and it was all he could afford.

I replied, ""Sorry, no. It's worth what I am asking, and I am selling for my son""

He replied right back saying  ""please let me have it, purple is her favourite colour, and she is next to me crying because she can't have it!""

I was getting fed up now, and just replied - ""no""

He then sent me a very rude reply the gist of it being that he hoped he never became an awful person like me, who cared about nothing about a poor child's feelings, but only about making money!

He was right..when I sell on eBay, making money is my main concern!

Ebay,"Do most non-auction Buy-It-Now sellers not stay current with the ""Sold Listings""?","Of course I haven't done an exhaustive survey ... but just anecdotally, it seems to me that the typical non-auction Buy-It-Now seller is a little out of touch with price trends established in ""Sold Listings"".

The usual case, I find, is for non-auction Buy-It-Now prices to be around three to five times greater than corresponding ""Sold Listings"" averages.  Even more striking: I believe the typical non-auction Buy-It-Now seller requests two or three times more money per item than anyone in recent eBay history ever paid for the item.  Maybe this at least partially explains why eBay is clogged with non-auction Buy-It-Now offers--?

Ebay,"Buyer claims item isn't working, fishy questions","I sold an Android cellphone to a buyer from Eastern Europe who had an ""agent"" pick up the phone in New Jersey. He paid, and the package was signed for in New Jersey and had shipping insurance and a tracking number on its way there.

A few days later, he's claiming the item does not work. I know for a fact it did before I sent it, and I had recorded a video just in case to prove it. I really doubt it was damaged by USPS. He then asks if I had any videos with the IMEI in it... I think this was him vetting my evidence...

Unfortunately, while I have the IMEI, I don't have it in the video, since my video was just showing the phone worked and not going through setup of the device. Additionally, if the phone wasn't working, why would he want the IMEI- he wouldn't be able to view it to compare anyway!

I told him I would accept a return if he wanted to return it, but he seems to want to hold on to the ""defective"" device, and was saying he'd check the cost of ""repairing"" it. I have a feeling he'll end up opening a dispute and attempt to keep the phone, and might send me a different (or damaged) phone as a return. Or get me to pay him for ""repairs"" some how.

Is there anything I can do with my USPS shipping insurance, since he's claiming the phone was damaged? I really doubt it was/is. What if he returns a different phone- what are my options then?",6,3,2016-05-30,EBAY,0.12250661849975586,0.8383921980857849,0.03910119831562042

Ebay,"Half-successful neutral feedback removal attempt for international buyer complaining about ""postage"" cost after receiving item.","My ""Buy it Now"" listing with calculated shipping on a 10 lb box, charged buyer exact cost, plus a $3 handling fee.  They complain in my feedback today that they bought a similar item from someone else, and paid ""half"" what they paid me for postage.

I did some easy detective work, and found the other item they bought.  It sold at about 35% of the price of my item, was incorrectly listed with ""1st Class International Package"" (for an item that weighs at least 8 lbs) and it was shipped through GSP.  So right there, the customs tax would have been much higher for the buyer on my item, and the postage would be more because it was correctly sent Priority Mail International, and would not have been subsidized or somehow ""fixed"" at the GSP hub.

In the past, I've had 3 of these complaints just outright wiped from my record, with a 3 minute phone call.  Not today.  I called in and they removed the feedback comment, but insisted on leaving the neutral mark on my account.  Even after I explain that the newbie buyer obviously doesn't understand that customs taxes related to item value are not postage, the other seller made an error and someone in the chain has ""eaten"" the overage, and the buyer is likely complaining about this as ""postage""...I am shut down and told that because buyer said ""postage was high"" in the comment, and didn't specifically mention ""taxes were high"", they won't wipe the rating completely.   The rep was an American male with a booming voice, that clearly understood my complaint, so he understands the nuances of English and exactly what happened, unlike the overseas phone people, but still he would not budge.  

Fair?  Probably not.  He was nice and personable, but the way they stick to these scripts and ""policy"" at all costs just insults my intelligence.

So after my Sherlock Holmes into the other seller, I conclude:  It looks like GSP is broken and/or subsidizing amateur seller listing mistakes with package weights and/or service level.  So the uneducated buyer of a seller-fulfilled international package appears to pay ""double"" if the order of events plays out this way.  So now I get to stare at an unearned Neutral rating for 12 months, for no reason.  Go eBay.

For those that use buyer requirements, you may consider adding Norway to your list of blocked countries.  For me, out of 3 recent transactions, 2 were problems.

I have a buyer that I believe either has buyer's remorse or just didn't read the description closely enough.

Despite my listing stating No refunds would be offered, I was willing to offer a partial refund of the purchase price minus my shipping fees to them (which were quite high).

I heard nothing back for 3 days and now just got a Refund Request w/ the reason being ""Wrong Item Sent"".
