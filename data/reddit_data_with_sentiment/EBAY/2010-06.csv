Ebay,"Help. Bought a ""new unused still in wrapper"" copy of Adobe Photoshop CS4, only to find that the license key has been revoked.","Yes, I feel like an idiot. I figure I owe you guys an ""I told you so"" moment so go ahead.


Moving on, I paid a good amount of money for Adobe CS4 (I want to learn, so dropping a grand for CS5 makes no sense to me). The item arrived in Adobe packaged with the plastic wrapper still intact, but 15 minutes after installing I get a pop-up while inside Photoshop saying the license key that I used (which was on my DVD case) has been revoked. Am I screwed out of ~250 bucks here?
