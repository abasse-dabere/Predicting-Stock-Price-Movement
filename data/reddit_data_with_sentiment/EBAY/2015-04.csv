Ebay,eBay/Paypal bug opens window to fraudulent transactions,"On Friday, I had a buyer purchase an item from me with a shipping address to Portland, Oregon. The value of this item was greater than US$1,000. The item was listed via buy-it-now with immediate payment required. The item was delivered on Monday.

Yesterday (Tuesday), Paypal opened a case because the Paypal account used for the purchase had been stolen. It was only then that I noticed that the address indicated on the Paypal transaction details page was in the U.K. In contrast, the address provided on the eBay Order Details page was an Oregon address.

I had to spend 3 - 4 hours on the phone with several eBay and Paypal representatives; none of them had seen something like this before since eBay and Paypal systems are generally integrated and designed to prevent the Paypal shipping address being inconsistent with the eBay shipping address. 

Ultimately the representative covered me under Paypal's seller protection policy since he recognized that I did everything I was supposed to do. He also forwarded the issue to the manager of his supervisors.

However, until the bug is fixed, I encourage everyone to verify that the address on their eBay order details page matches the address indicated on the Paypal payment for their high-value sales.

Edit: Some images may provide more clarity. [This](http://i.imgur.com/snf2XDo.jpg) is the paypal page for the transaction. [This](http://i.imgur.com/d9Hc1l8.jpg) is the eBay Order Details page for the same transaction.",10,8,2015-04-01,EBAY,0.04904429242014885,0.9263769388198853,0.02457880601286888

I said yes, that's what I would prefer. So now he's escalated the case saying that I want a refund and didn't send everything back *and* that the laptop works fine.

I can't find any way to contact ebay. It just shows a message saying they will make a decision and let me know. How can I contact ebay?

I have been in touch with the seller and got the following response:
-------------
Im glad you messaged me, because I was about to message you. I want you to be aware of a problem that I have run into sending the package. You paid for shipping, $20 or so, which should cover the shipping cost. However, the way paypal or UPS is set up is that I initially pay for shipping, and then your payment reimburses me once it is shipped. That's all good, except paypal says that I need money in my account to pay for the shipping. I have put money in, but it says that it will take 3-4 days to process and be in my account..... I hope that you can see my frustration! So I want you to know that I am not trying to cheat you or provide bad service! Right now paypal is making me want to snap my computer in half! Anyway, once the money is officially in my account I can then ""buy"" the shipping label and get the table sent off asap. Unfortunately this probably means that I won't be able to send it until Monday. I sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. I will keep you updated with any news and message you once it is sent.

Ebay,A question about the $500 seller limit...,"Greetings...a question about seller limits that I can't seem to find on eBay or Google.  For Monthly Selling Limits, eBay states, ""You can sell up to 5 items or up to $500.00 per month, whichever comes first.""  In previous months, when listing up to 5 items, in my Selling overview, eBay deducts whatever I list the 5 items for from the 500.  For example, if I list 3 books, 2 books at 100 dollars and 1 at 300 dollars (didn't know there would be math), my 500 dollars is ""used up"" for the month...

The question is this.  Is the 500 dollars a cap before selling only?  In other words, If I list 2 books for 250 each, totaling 500 for the month, will eBay allow the sale for both if when the auction ends, each reach say, 400 each, which would take me over 500?

Aswell when i opened the bottle it wa sseverly liquedy and didnt even dry.. I will aldo be contacti g limecrime becaus eur selling there knock off products... Can u please tell me hiw we are gonna fix this problem??


Just by how she wrote this, I knew I was screwed.

I send her the original packing slip, a screenshot of the paypal transaction with the invoice matching the original packing slip.

She sends me this:

Please fix this problem i have 4 other producs that i bought and i really need this one it doesnt work its severly liquidy and the box seal was broken and even looked liked it was not even full


I tell her liquid products are never full to the brim cause you need space to push the product on the ground.

Shen then says product is leaking. I asked for photo, she sends me photo of box that has a broken seal (duh, she opened it, how does she even know its leaking if she hasnt opened it) then a selfie saying product is not as described/defective. now shes even wearing it! 

at this point, I had it with her, and was snarky and said that even though the color washes her out, its buyer remorse and not defectiveness (she even called me out for reselling it higher than in stores, the color is Cashmere which is sold out everywhere and I was selling it at the lowest price which I guess attracted bottom feeders), 

she then opens up a case saying I used discrimination on her for her race (she's Latina) and she says that I told her the color only looks good on white girls (I NEVER SAID THAT). At this point, I am fucking MAD as hell. I know I let her win by being snarky I admit (its so hard to have ""customer service"" with someone who writes ghetto and has every excuse cause she wants 100% refund and to keep product, so I had to send her a photo of myself just to be like ""BITCH, WE ARE OF THE SAME RACE, DO NOT USE THE MINORITY CARD HERE"" (I DID NOT write that). I should have never send her a photo of myself but I really hate when people claim discrimination when they were not being discriminated against.

Ebay,Seller is taking a long time dispatching my item.

I bought this last Tuesday night and it said it would be delivered on Saturday (yesterday). On Friday I emailed the seller because i hadn't received an email confirming that the Launch Box had been dispatched and the seller said he had a family emergency and hadn't found the time to send it and that he'd send it within the next 2 days. He didn't do that. Its 3 days later and he still hasn't sent it and i emailed him this morning asking about it and he hasn't replied.

I'm just looking for the best way to deal with this without pissing him off by emailing him too much or being rude (because I'm starting to get quite pissed off with him) and cancelling the order because i got it for a good price, second hand Launch boxes are quite rare to find on eBay and i just want my Goddamn vaporiser.

Ebay,[Help] My husband bought something with free shipping. Now the seller is asking him to chip in for shipping...?!,"Good morning, everyone.

So my husband bid on and won an auction for an item that came with free shipping. Today, he received a message stating the following:

**""Hello _____, It's going to cost me $7.55 to send this to you. Would you be willing to chip in a couple extra bucks to cover this? You will get this regardless but I had to ask.""**

The seller isn't allowed to do this, correct? I've been on eBay for what seems like forever, and I have never encountered a situation like this. It just puts us in a weird situation, and my husband is very uncomfortable.

He is worried that he will get negative feedback as a buyer if he does not give her money for shipping. I told him that if she wanted money for shipping, she would have had to include that in the auction.

I guess my questions are -- this is not allowed by eBay, correct? Is there any sort of ""statute"" that we can cite when we respond, nicely, saying sorry, but we can't do that? And if the seller does give him negative feedback, is this a situation that calls for eBay being able to remove the negative feedback?

What would you all recommend we do? Thanks in advance!

Both ebay and PayPal will do nothing to compensate me because there was never any processed payment from the buyer. I've talked to several reps.

Ebay,Advise dealing with harassing ebayer,"Looking for advise on dealing with an ebayer that is harrasing me and my listings.

I am selling a broken camcorder for parts/repair.
I listed it for dirt cheap (25$ with free shipping)  I just plan on covering shipping, packing material, gas, and ebay/paypal fees.  In the end I will make less than 10 bucks profit.  I just dont want to see it end up in a landfill if maybe someone can use it for something.

So this buyer started with an email Monday, asking me to do a series of test on this camcorder.
By series I mean he wanted me do go through a list of procedures in a row and tell him the results.  Do this and then what happens, then while holding this button do this and what happens......
And then he ended the message, when you do those tests and tell me the result, I have other questions I'll ask you to address before I decide on buying.

I just emailed him back that this was not worth my time to do all this since I am selling it for parts/repair and do not anticipate making any profit.

Well that ticked him off.  He's been emailing me multiple times that I'm trying to pull a scam.  He's going to report me to ebay for being a scammer.  He said my pictures are very out of focus and that I'm trying to hide what I'm really selling.  (They are not out of focus by the way)
He also said my camcorder may be stolen property and he's going to report me for handling stolen merchandise.

I've been getting a constant barrage since yesterday.

I have been calm and polite throughout and have asked him to stop emailing me.  I think he sensed weakness, because that's when he really accelerated his # of messages.  This morning he sent a message through all 15 of my items that I have listed on ebay.  He's saying stuff like the picture is out of focus.  On another one he wrote, the description doesn't match what you're selling.  

What do I do?  This guy is a total weirdo!

I have stopped responding to his messages, but now on the MY EBAY page, all the stuff I have for sale has a red banner next to it saying PENDING QUESTION

If I dont answer, will this affect my listing placements on ebay search??

Ebay,"I was the Buyer, and PayPal scammed the Seller.","I finally decided to give eBay a shot despite hearing all these horror stories. Let me tell you, these stories are not fabricated, not one bit. 

I opened the account around 3 PM (Eastern Time), and only had Bitcoins. After finding out that the Internet doesn't readily accept them yet, I bought some giftcards via Gyft to pay for my item. All went well on that end, and I hit the redemption button, checked out on eBay, paid, got tracking, and was happy.


Fast forward to this morning. I got an e-mail from PayPal stating my account was permanently limited. Permanent, mind you I am a new customer. The e-mail said there was suspcious activity on a card on my account ---- I never linked a card. Maybe phising right? Logged into PayPal, and loandbehold, there was the limitation.


It gets worst. They reversed the payment to the seller. Not only did this poor guy just lose $160, but I don't have the courage to contact him and ask him to cancel his shipment since he'd incur a $11.50 + postal fees from USPS. I also don't want it to seem like I was a fraudulent buyer, since I put down all my information (real), and I'm sure sellers share it elsewhere, in some kind of database.


What do I do? I called PayPal and of course nothing came of it; they wouldn't even discuss why it was refunded. I don't want to sit on this money forever, I just need a way to pay this guy, before he cancels the thing. I really want my item this Friday, but I doubt anyone would let that go through. Even further, he doesn't check his e-mails (so it seems).

Ebay,"Can't find item that was shipped, UPS says I signed for it but I 100% did not, what should I do?","TL;DR: Bought item, never got shipping number/information.  Can't find item, seller then sends shipping number and UPS tracking information says I signed for it... while I was out of town.  No idea where the item is, UPS and eBay said they will open up a claim where the seller can resend item or refund the money, but I don't think that is fair.  Should I lose $300 or should he lose $300?

Hi everyone, here is the long story.

I am rebuilding a car and have been ordering a ton of parts, but I have been sending them to my dad's business (garage/gas station) while I live a couple hundred miles away.  So I order this particular item back in January and finally went back home to do some work a couple of weeks ago but could not find this item.  Looked high and low, easily found the other 17 packages because they were all in the same room, but cannot find this item.

So I look through my email and I never got a shipping number for this item.  I look in my eBay account and there is no record of it in my purchase history.  I look in my PayPal account and it says I paid for it and has a link for the eBay item in my ""order details"", a page which I cannot find on it's own except through this link.  On this ""order details"" page under shipping information it just says estimated delivery of January 15 - January 23 but no shipping or shipper information.

So I contact the seller and he says he shipped it and two days later gave me a shipping number.  The shipping number says that someone with my name signed for it on January 16, but I was hours away that day.  I looked through some other emails and saw another item I got from a different website was delivered that day and that item was in the pile of boxes, so where is this particular eBay item?

I called eBay and they said ""this is weird, I don't see a record of that purchase"", and then said they would put me through to PayPal to file a claim.  Well 20 minutes on hold I hung up and called UPS and UPS said they will call the sender and get some information.  They said his options would be to resend the item, which he can't because it's a used 50 year old part, or refund my money, which I don't think is fair to him because I believe he sent it, especially considering he has a 99.7% positive feedback from almost 9000 reviews.

I guess I'm asking what would you do?  Should I eat the $302 or should I get a refund from the seller when it doesn't seem to be his mistake?

Ebay,Advice on a SNAD seller who is barely communicating and seems to be dragging their feet on the return.,"I have not opened a case yet. Here is the timeline:

**3/22**- Contact seller about two items to insure they are  complimentary/compatible and inquire about combined shipping. Seller sells many like items so you want to make sure you get two that go together.  Seller responds and says they are and he will throw the smaller item in the box with the big item 

**3/23** - I purchase two items from seller which  cost about the same for a total of $300 and pay $50 shipping.

**3/27** - Receive items but do not inspect until after the weekend on 3/30 when I realize the big item is significantly not as described.

**3/30** - Contact seller about the SNAD item but receive no response.

**4/1** - Resend email after waiting 2 days with no response and add the part about how I'm not getting a response.

**4/1** - receive this response ""i will resend the correct wand and send a fedex label"". 

**4/2** - My reply ""Awesome, thank you. If there is a way to email me the FedEx label I will expedite the return."" no response. I have a job coming up that I need the items for so I am attempting to speed up the process. 

**4/6**- Because I have the job coming up I send a message to the seller asking if I should repurchase the items and just deal with the return/cancel order when he receives the original items back. I'm now not sure the smaller item actually goes with the bigger item so I ask this also.

**4/8** - Today - I have still received no response except the one from 4/2.

I have not opened a case yet because the seller has been a member since 2003 with +1500 sales and a %100 feedback score.  I am tired of the lack of communication and am thinking I should open a SNAD case for the bigger item ($50 shipping he has to pay for) and return the smaller item (listing states 30 day return) in a different package at my expense.
I need these items in the mail yesterday for my job next week and have found them elsewhere.
Any advice? I have never returned an item, do I need to open a case for the smaller item also? Should I wait a few more days?",4,3,2015-04-08,EBAY,0.05377186834812164,0.9132290482521057,0.03299909457564354

8 days later he leaves a message saying that it stopped working 4 minutes after using it 'for the first time' and demands a refund.

Ebay,"Maybe I'm missing something, about the GSP","Hey all,

Speaking as a buyer.

Given the choice between two sellers of the same product, one who ships via USPS and one via courier (fedex/ups/dhl), I'd always pick USPS. Mainly because I'm not home when couriers visit, and at least in my city, it's extremely tricky to leave them instructions and/or pick it up at the depot (I dont have a car). USPS prevents so many headaches in my case.



But now it seems these days many sellers prefer to use the global shipping program. In some cases, for certain kinds of goods, it's the only option. I feel when I'm buying something with the GSP, I'm playing russian roulette, or flipping a coin. Where I don't have the choice anymore between no-worry canpost/usps, and a headache-inducing time-wasting courier. The lack of clear choice is problematic, in my case.

GPU's depreciate in value very quickly, so Its highly unlikely I would be able to sell it for the value I originally recieved last month.

Can I refuse to pay for it, after it was returned to me via a fraudulant resolution claim?

If not, could I make the claim that the value of the item has depreciated in value since the original sale, and therefore reduce the amount ebay is demanding I pay them?

Or should i just suck it up and repay? I feel like a victim of fraud, despite having the card returned to me.

Ebay,"Buyer left positive comment but negative feedback, eBay can do nothing. So frustrating.","A buyer bought two items from me recently, left a positive feedback comment for each but the feedback was negative.

I contacted the (new &lt;10 feedback) buyer but have received no response (I think English is not their first language judging by the country (Israel) so maybe they had trouble understanding or have just plain ignored it).

Contacted eBay chat, the guy said 'Yes, I can see that it was left negative as a mistake.. I'll get the team to email you.'

They mail, look into it, say 'you'll have to contact the seller as the shipping time DSR had an issue.'

I point out that even now, we're well within the stated delivery times, so that makes zero sense. How can a DSR for shipping be low if it's been delivered in the stated times?

Also, my DSR stars haven't changed like they would with a low rating (with a low number of overall ratings for DSR as a relatively new seller myself they would drop from full I'm sure) so I can't see how this could be an issue either.

Then it was tracking, the eBay rep said they just noticed the tracking details were not updated (as with any tracking number I put in, not sure what eBays problem with tracking is).

In any case I sent a mail with the tracking number and a link to the post website where they can see it was tracked and sent.

But.. nothing.

""I understand that this might not by the response that you are expecting but I trust that I've professionally communicated things clearly and wish you all the best on your future trading here on eBay.""

Communicated what?

I sent a tracked package, the feedback comment was positive, the items have clearly arrived within time, a low DSR for shipping time obviously is unfounded if today we're still within the shipping period.. what the hell?!

It's so frustrating, it's only two negative but on a clean and small record they make a huge dent, especially as I was about to make Top Seller this week after months of work. It's unbelievable.

Is there anything I can do?


EDIT: After all morning talking to people, turns out the buyer left a low DSR for shipping time. Positive comment, negative feedback for shipping time.

The item arrived within the time stated, tracking shows this, but apparently the buyer is entitled to an opinion and Ebay cannot step in to change this. The buyers opinion trumps facts somehow. Maybe they use a different calender in Israel, I dunno.

So even though it makes no sense whatsoever, and the shipping time clearly wasn't bad, there is nothing I can do except ask the buyer to reconsider (except they won't respond to messages).

I read about sellers being screwed all the time, guess it was only a matter of time until I experienced it myself.

Ebay,Am I getting scammed?,"I bid on a watch and was outbid.

Then I got an email from the seller saying that the buyer was from Israel and complaining about the shipping charges ($55). The item description clearly stated that international shipping could be as much as $100.  The seller wants to know if I am willing to buy the watch if the winner backs out.

I looked at the winning bidders history and noticed **he has bought from this same seller two other times**, this would be the third out of a total of seventeen purchases. Is the seller just using a shill to get to my maximum price?

Should I report this?

**UPDATE**:  I started to report the seller and looked at my inbox and there was a message from him apologising and explaining that the buyer had, after all, paid.  I was wrong in my assumptions but it sure looked kind of funny.",9,5,2015-04-11,EBAY,0.07827796041965485,0.8557402491569519,0.06598173081874847

Ebay,Listing on eBay is too good to be true. How safe am I if I pull the trigger on it?,"Ok so, I've stumbled upon this listing that has a BIN for 90$, but the item retails for 300$. Here are some things to consider:

* I've reread the description multiple times, there isn't any misdirection or deception (i.e. listing is actually just for the box). The description is just a copy paste of what you'd find on a major retailer's page for this item.
* Seller has 25 feedback, but all of it is from buying. Ebay member since 2003. 
* Seller has 8 available, and 2 are sold.

I really want to pull the trigger on this, and although I'm no ebay expert, I believe I'm covered by their buyer protection right? Like I have nothing to lose here? I mean I wouldn't be opposed to buying this even if the seller obtained them through questionable means. 

All of this boils down to the following: How safe am I if I decide to buy it? If I'm 100% guaranteed to get my money back after finding out it's a scam, I wouldn't be opposed to making the purchase.",11,2,2015-04-11,EBAY,0.026200640946626663,0.9191772937774658,0.05462207272648811
Ebay,Ethical Question: Starting to resell on ebay with a friend. Is it a conflict of interest to also sell things on my own?,"By buddy and I plan on shopping garage sales and thrift shops when he moves out here and decided to sell some stuff on ebay for some extra cash (I've been doing it on my own for a little while now). We want to resell things together and create a ""fund"" for helping family, some savings, beer money etc. Any money we pool together for our side ""business"" goes to that fund and we decide together what to do with it. The problem is, I still want to sell things on the side. I feel if I'm shopping by myself and come across something I can resell for profit, I should be able to do that and keep the profits for myself. My friend is convinced that its a conflict of interest. He believes that anything I find in the reselling market must go to the ""business"" and if I find a good deal I should split the profits with him, even if I choose to use my own money. I feel this is a strange position to take considering 1. This is just a part time gig for some extra cash. I'm not looking to create a ""business"". 2. If I purchase something with my money, it becomes my property, which means I can do whatever I want with it, including selling it for a profit. Since this is reselling, the ""conflict of interest"" rules wouldn't apply in the same way would they? 
I'm looking for honest feedback. Thank you!",10,2,2015-04-11,EBAY,0.02173498459160328,0.9274937510490417,0.05077124759554863

I would like to get reimbursed for the broken one. Half the price of everything. Sorry about this but a broken bottle does me no good whatsoever. Please respond, let me know how I can e-mail you those pictures.""

In my listing, I write:

""2 antique / vintage miniature perfume bottles. I am unsure of their age, but I suspect they were made in the 30s or 40s at the latest. Both are around 2.75"" tall.

One is in perfect condition. The other has a crack on the side, and a small chip on the bottle. I'm unsure as to whether or not it would hold any liquid. It's still quite beautiful regardless. There is a small spot on rust on the cap (pictured).

The caps are likely silver plate.

There is a bit of grime / residue on the inside of the bottles, but nothing too serious. The dabbers still have a very nice scent.""

The defects should be visible from the photos, assuming the description was read.

I offer returns, so there is no case, however, I am worried she is going to leave me negative feedback. Here is the whole story:

Buyer buys a wig from me and asks for additional photographs, which I take and send to her. She also asks about shipping time, and I state that my units are made-to-order (I don't have stock; I put the order in w/ my manufacturer when my customers order.) My listing states that they are manufactured-to-order. Exact listing says:

""I now purchase all of my wigs from a manufacturer based near New York. I order the wigs unbranded as not to run into any licensing issues with the units. Retail prices are based on the most expensive prices I have seen similar units for. Before the Local Beauty Supply Store in my home town had to close, they would sell similar units for about the same as I have listed, +/- $20. Even wigs in the retailing $100s are still relatively inexpensive if the unit is lace front and heat resistant.""

I sell the wigs unbranded and state in the listing that I remove the tags from the wigs to protect my supplier's identity. One of the photographs shows the wig on top of the packaging from the supplier I bought it from. Ebayer responds that it is a 'beautiful' wig.

Today, the wig got shipped in, and I got a return request for INAD because she is claiming that I bought it from a Beauty Supply store in my local area (I have the order information from my manufacturer on record to disprove this). There is no evidence supporting this. Her claim says:

""Wig, was suppose to be handmade this wig was bought from a beauty supply store in Seller s home town and sold to me double the price! As, the photos show the seller emailed me the box in the background the wig actually comes from this is far from a Handmade wig!! I am a requesting a refund immediately thanks a bunch! Seller s message to me as follows : Dear kpar8834, The wig you ordered has a 5 business day handling time as it is made-to-order, as stated in the original listing. As such, tracking will be purchased and uploaded before or on Wednesday. - wantable-wigs ""

If my listing stated obviously that the item is not handmade and that it is ordered from a manufacturer, will I have any basis in removing negative feedback or rejecting the return if it relates to this specific issue? I have been a long stalker of this thread and would appreciate some help!",5,7,2015-04-14,EBAY,0.11016279458999634,0.8660247325897217,0.02381245605647564
Ebay,FedEx Ground: Question about signature requirements.,"Hey folks, for those who use FedEx often (I do not) I have a question. 

I am not sure, but I think my FedEx Ground delivery driver has an attitude.  I ordered a vintage laptop on eBay for $28 (which included shipping) and the seller for some reason put direct signature required for the delivery and sent it off FedEx Ground.  

Today I get a door tag for the missed delivery, and this is what it looked like [link](http://imgur.com/tMeVv54). The bottom perforated piece where you would ordinarily sign and put it back on your door was ripped off, and I found it on the ground against the wall.  

I'm confused, is it normal for them to do that?  I feel like in the past, I've just signed the bottom, stuck it back on the door the next day when I go to work, and it's there on my porch when I get home.  I called FedEx and the guy kind of stonewalled me, and said that yes, i'd absolutely have to be there for the delivery.  

I have a big problem with this.  I work, and the FedEx Ground lady comes any time between 10AM and 2PM!  I can't guarantee I'll be there.  I can try to take a long lunch and hope that I catch her, but  I'm kind of pissed.  

Am I wrong?  Is it normal for them to be so insistent upon somebody actually being home to sign for the delivery and not allow you to sign the signature slip at the bottom so that they just leave it?

Wednesday I'm headed out of state for five days, so basically tomorrow's my last shot.  I can't do a hold at location either, because that's an hour away and I don't have a car.  

Thanks for any tips or words of wisdom.  It's entirely possible that I'm misunderstanding something about FedEx's policy here.  It's frustrating that they (the ebay seller, not FedEx) put this kind of signature requirement on a $28 item!",13,6,2015-04-14,EBAY,0.06865639984607697,0.9011613130569458,0.03018222749233246
Ebay,I need some advice on a computer I just sold.,"I made a listing on eBay today for a gaming laptop with a $600 buy it now option. It sold within 6 hours. I'm glad it sold quickly, but I have a few reservations. Although I received payment, the eBay name for the user shows a completely different name from their PayPal name. The last names don't even match. They did however pay using the eBay/PayPal option so I'm not sure how big of deal it is.

Also, the eBay account was created 3 days ago on the 10th and as such, they have 0 feedback. I'm always weary of selling to people with no feedback.

Anyways, all that aside, I've decided to ship the item tomorrow. Before I do, I'm going to do the following:
 
- Document every aspect of the fully-functional computer with pictures and videos (I'll include the serial # in these)
- Document how I'm packaging the computer for shipping
- Definitely get USPS insurance for the full $600.

What do you guys think? Should I ship at all? If so, am I taking the right steps, or is there anything more I can do? Thanks for your help guys!",5,5,2015-04-14,EBAY,0.02575208805501461,0.9232577085494995,0.05099017173051834
Ebay,Advice please - Looking to dropship on a small scale but not a powerseller,"Hi

I have an ebay rating of 89 at present. I'm a small time seller of various items. 

I found a small niche in electronics and plan to dropship from a Chinese supplier. Having done the calculations I believe I can come out with a £10-£15 profit after fees per item but I'd only be looking at sales of at best 5-10 units per week maybe.

Also I've looked at the prices of the current top sellers of the same items and I can certainly compete and undercut on their prices but obviously my listing isn't going to be anywhere near theirs in terms of listing results unless filtered by price.

Just looking for some advice...

* I've seen offers to set up professional looking ebay templates for sales on places like fiverr which look decent, would this be a good idea? I'd like my page to look as professional as possible but unsure about the best way to go about it

*In regards to shipping, would it be better to factor in the cost of shipping from my supplier to the overall ebay listing price so that I can list the items on ebay as 'FREE SHIPPING'?

But then I may have to limit the sales to the Uk and Europe (im Uk based) in order to fulfil this.

Would appreciate any other advice on getting started.

Thanks.",3,4,2015-04-14,EBAY,0.01789391227066517,0.8871632814407349,0.09494276344776154

Ebay,International selling restrictions. (Question),"So I tried making a listing on ebay and was hit with this message.

To sell internationally, you need to:
Have an eBay account in good standing.
Have a PayPal account and be PayPal Verified.
Have at least 10 Feedback points earned as a seller.
Have had your first successful sale more than 90 days ago.
Meet the selling requirements of the sites where you want your listings to appear.

So I have a question about this.

I live in Japan and the Japanese ebay site seems more like an information portal as Ebay has partnered with another company who has an auction site to sell.

One of the conditions to life the international restriction is to have 10 sale feedbacks from your country. As I cant post to Ebay Japan I have a little question about this.

Does this mean I cant make local sales or does it mean if I open an ebay.com account I can only sell to US customers. Or is ebay going based on my geo location information from the IP and telling me to make 10 sales in Japan?",2,3,2015-04-15,EBAY,0.018909068778157234,0.932634174823761,0.04845680296421051

Ebay,Delivery confirmed by suspected fake courier,"My item was 'despatched' on 4/4/15 by a user with no previous ebay history.

Today (17/4/15) I received a tracking number for 'Fastlikejet'. Their website says my item was delivered 9/4/15 but I'm sure this is not the case.

I have opened a 'did not receive item' ticket on Ebay. Apparently I now have to wait 8 days before this can be escalated.

I can't find any evidence online to suggest Fastlikejet is a legitimate courier. 

I'd like suggestions on whether you agree with this assessment of Fastlikejet, and to ask whether there's any way to escalate this with Ebay if sure this company doesn't exist rather than wait 8 days for the seller to cover their tracks.

If the seller goes dark, can I still get a refund through Paypal (assuming the courier is fake and the parcel never arrives)?

Ebay,Compromised Paypal Account,"I would post this on the Paypal subreddit, but it seems to be dead there, and it is somewhat eBay related.

So I got a few emails a few hours ago saying that there were purchases made from my Paypal account. I did not make these purchases, nor did I authorize them.

I quickly signed in, changed my password and other security info, and disputed the transactions.

Ebay,getting (possibly) scammed by someone,"Hi

The SD card reader on my phone broke so I decided to sell it on ebay. The description of the sale was very clear that the SD card reader was broken and that was the reason for the sale.Other than that perfect condition.

Got a really good price for it anyway and many bids. A lot of the bids seeming to come from people who could fix it and sell it on.

Anyway I packaged it with great care, threw in a few bonus accessories and awaited my five star review in keeping with my 100% record.

Disappointed not to hear anything after a week i thought he'd have been delighted with the speed of delivery, quality of packaging and extra free items.

After 3 weeks he contacts me to say he has just opened the package and that the phone doesnt work at all. I suspect he tried and failed to fix the SD reader, and broke the phone but who knows. I used the phone every day, and charged it before i sent it. It was 100%

After a few back and forths it went to arbirtration, and ebay took his side! WTF! So he is sending me back a broken phone and ebay have given him a refund and now want the money from me

Anything I can do? Who waits 3 weeks to open a package! Totally gutted, was a top of the range phone. Seems like its wide open for abuse.

Ebay,Should I Refund/Send a Replacement for this Buyer?,"I had a buyer message me saying that the item I sent him stopped working in an hour of use.

Ebay,Ebay Store vs. Ink Frog,"I recently checked out Ink Frog for listing items and I like it much more than Turbo Lister.  It's faster and has an easy to use interface.

Ebay,Buyers can be great too!,"This subreddit sees alot of negativity about sellers getting ripped off and strong armed by buyer which inevitably leads to them losing out either in time or in most cases in money. But I'd like to mention those understanding buyers they are 100% fantastic when things go wrong. 

I sent out a couple of sales in the same day and got them mixed up so they got the wrong items. Once the first buyer sent me a message letting me know they got the wrong item he was happy to return it and have it refunded (plus return postage costs). They even left good feedback and I quote ""I'll leave you good feedback to pretend it didn't happen"". These are the best kind of buyers that act like humans and appreciate mistakes can be made. So to all of you buyers out there, thank you for understanding when things go tits-up.

Ebay,Risktaking on Postage,"I am faced with the situation of rising postage charges in the UK impacting my ability to sell profitably and am faced with the choice between two postal providers for my low value items (less than £20):

* Hermes through Parcel2Go: £2.34 for a tracked, but no signature service. The tracking shows proof of delivery and should provide enough evidence if an item not received case is opened, I believe? However, if it is 'damaged or lost' in transit there is no insurance coverage by Parcel2Go themselves.
* Royal Mail 2nd Class: £2.80 for an untracked standard small parcel - there's no tracking but they have £20 compensation for loss or damage. Obviously I can't claim under seller protection here, but can claim from Royal Mail.

I tend to offer free postage on the basic level and in the past offered Hermes/2nd Class Royal Mail/1st Class Royal Mail as my options, since Hermes charge a fee for some remote areas while other customers don't want to use them.

What do you think about the no insurance service, given that I do get tracking and the lower price benefit? Both have been equally reliable for me in the past but I haven't used Hermes/Parcel2Go since they stopped offering included insurance. 

*Edit: Also Hermes sometimes deliver to porches or other 'safe places' and this shows in the tracking. Would this affect my ability to claim on eBay?*",20,3,2015-04-18,EBAY,0.03134461119771004,0.918428897857666,0.050226498395204544
Ebay,Buyer issues with hand painted item,"I make custom painted items (think 40k) and sell some of them on ebay to make money to buy more and keep my hobby going

I've sold a few with no issues but have had a few where the person bids or offers and then doesn't pay. I open unpaid item cases so it's just an annoyance but now I'm dealing with one who's taking it a step further

He put offers on two similar items with a lower price on one than the other. I went ahead and accepted both seeing the second one as a discount for buying two.

So he messages me saying he didn't expect me to accept so soon and he'll pay the next day or so when he gets paid. I say that's fine and if he does it by Friday morning I can ship before the weekend. I have them boxed and ready to ship.

Then he doesn't pay and I remind him. He gets back to me with excuses about not being able to afford both and (of course) can only afford the cheaper one. The one that's only cheaper because he was buying both. He paid for that one so I figured I should at least uphold my end even if he didn't uphold his. But then he asks for pictures claiming the ones in the auction are blurry (they're not). I maybe should have opened the package but instead told him it's already set to ship (and honestly don't even know what new angles I could have taken). I'm seeing warning flags at this point

So sure enough he got my item and he messages me saying he's not satisfied. He cites small imperfections (which clearly show in the pictures and are from being a small hand painted item) and that the box is not sealed (when the listing clearly states the item ships in its open box).

I'm just waiting for him to claim I should give him a full refund including shipping or for him to open a case against me (his unpaid item case is now closed for the other item at least)

He has an account with like 5 feedback but it's all positive. Somehow. That's part of why I accepted his offers.

I haven't dealt with this before. What can I expect if he opens a case?  Should I be contacting ebay now to cut this off at the pass? Or what should I be doing? 

(I've also learned to not do auctions or best offers anymore due to crap like this. Buy it now only from now on.)",4,3,2015-04-18,EBAY,0.02947685867547989,0.9091072678565979,0.06141586974263191

Ebay,[PSA] Be wary of buyers asking to change the shipping address.,"I had my Paypal hacked on Friday, and multiple eBay purchases were made through it. I messaged the sellers to warn them and I was told that right after they purchased the item, they got a message from the buyer/scammer saying that they put in the wrong address and want to change it. They will usually use some excuse like ""I want to send it directly to my brother as a present"" or ""I just moved recently and forgot to update my address"", or something along those lines.

I Have also had 2 of these requests from my own sales in the past 24 hours alone.

It seems that there may have been some sort of Paypal breach, or something, because there seems to be a lot of these cases going around.

Just as a general reminder, it is always good practice to change your passwords often to avoid situations like these.

EDIT: It could be it is actually legit. If that is the case, it is still advisable to get the buyer to agree to cancel the transaction and purchase it again with the correct address. This way you will be covered by the seller protection and be able to avoid a lot of headache if there are any issues.",2,10,2015-04-19,EBAY,0.10073728114366531,0.8683692812919617,0.03089340403676033
Ebay,In the middle of a weird situation involving ebay and amazon. Not sure what to do.,"I have a really confusing situation going on right now and I'm not sure what to do. This is what happened:

I bought an item off of Amazon from a third party seller and received the item with no consequence.

Later, I received an iPhone in the mail that I never ordered, never paid for, but was addressed to me. The packing label is from eBay and has a username that does not match my eBay username.  

Then after that, I got an email from my Amazon seller. They accidentally sent me an iPhone that was supposed to be for their daughter. They're asking me to please return it to them. The address they put to return it to doesn't match the address on the package, different name, state and everything.

I was able to use the item # from the packing label to find the sender of the package. I contacted them and let them know I received an iPhone that I did not order. They said that my name was on the shipping label from eBay, and that when they asked the buyer why the name on the shipping label was different they said they were buying it for a friend. (There is no way any friend of mine would send me an iPhone over eBay.)

I have an idea of what happened, but it seems kind of convoluted. All I know is I got an iPhone I never bought, and now have two different people asking me to ship it to them. I really don't know what to do and wish that I had never gotten involved in this mess. All this just from buying something on Amazon.

Advice needed please!!!

Edit: Not sure if this was wise, but I contacted the Amazon seller who was requesting the iPhone be returned to them. I said I wanted to help them, but that I didn't understand why the addresses didn't match or how they accidentally sent me an iPhone. They replied saying that they bought it from the eBay seller for someone else, but somehow my info was accidentally put onto the shipping label from my recent transaction with them. They said to avoid further complications I could just return it to the eBay seller. I kind of feel like they were trying to scam on eBay and realized that they weren't going to get the iPhone from me easily so gave up on it. But I also wonder if I am overly suspicious. Anyway, I am going to return it to the eBay seller. Thanks to everyone who gave advice!",20,9,2015-04-19,EBAY,0.049563657492399216,0.9215661883354187,0.028870122507214546

Ebay,When to leave negative feedback?,"I recently purchased an item from a fairly new user on ebay and the whole experience has just been horrendous his description specifically stated ""no reserve, no time wasters"" so naturally I proceeded to pay promptly for a fast and easy transaction only to find out the seller doesn't have PayPal which wasn't stated in the description or anywhere else.

Luckily I live close enough to collect so the seller contacted me I agreed that coming to collect the item was okay and asked when would be best. After that it was 4 days until the seller responded, after I had gotten in touch with eBay Help seller then gave me a day and time but no address and continued to not respond eBay provided me with his phone number which he answered once and has proceeded to ignore after the first call again after getting in touch with eBay he responded and I will be collecting the item later today hopefully.

 Anyway my question is am I entitled to leave negative feedback directed at the seller if everything is okay with the item? Because as of now I would never buy of this seller again and I would advice others to avoid.

Ebay,Seller possibly over selling stock and refunding the lowest ended auctions?,"So on 3/4 I purchased an item as a ""preorder"" of sorts. In the item it stated that it would ship no later than 3/25. I knew all that going into it, and was fine with it.  Honestly I bought this as a little surprise to my future self knowing I'd likely forget I purchased it. That's beside the point I think.

Fast forward to this week and I get a refund for the amount of the auction + shipping. $26 in total. Not a large amount and I probably shouldn't get my feathers ruffled.. but I did.

What struck me as odd is that the refund just showed up one day. No message attached to it or anything.. just a refund. So I message the seller and ask what happened etc. No response for a bit so I start digging through their feedback to see how many of these items he sold in that same timeframe. They sold 3 or 4 of them. Only one person has left feedback for their items and of course it's a positive. That item (the same as mine, different auction) sold for $44 after shipping. The feedback left is ""A++++++++ 5 stars thank you"". With that- I assume the buyer got their item and are happy. Note- though, their item ended on 3/5. Mine ended on 3/4.

I message the seller again, this time bringing up the feedback that was left by the other buyer. Seller claims the manufactuer ""lost the shipment"" and seller sent out a message to everyone. I don't have a message to my email or my eBay.

Ebay,Samsung S6 Edge Scam,"I've been following the sales of the Samsung S6 Edge on eBay for the past few weeks, and yesterday suddenly one popped up for £409 (for a 128GB Brand new and Unlocked version). The description of the item said to contact ""*********@gmail.com"" (not sure if I'm allowed to post the email) for the terms of sale.

Naturally it seemed way too suspicious but the seller had 5024 feedbacks at 100%. I contacted him via email and what he wanted for the sale was my eBay username, Billing name and shipping address. He said that he will then issue an invoice through eBay. He avoided the questions of how he got the phone and why he was selling it so cheaply. After 3 replies he stopped responding.

Now, the weird thing is that that seller was only selling wedding invitation cards (hundreds), and the samsung was the only odd sale it had on. The sale then disappeared and an hour or so later appeared again, but from a completely different ebayer, this time with 4837 feedbacks. The description was exactly the same and pointed to the same email address, but the seller information was completely different. Later the same day I found the exact same thing again from a seller with 6977 feedbacks, but for £500 as opposed to £409 (but still with same conditions and email in the description).

As I understand this was one person who managed to gain access to different accounts and was posting the bait deal. And after he would get paid he would ditch the account and the buyer (once realising he didn't get the item) would take up the issue with the seller who wouldn't even have known that their account was used to make this sale. 

Any suggestions on what can be done about this? Is there a way to properly report it? It seems like a big issue considering the person managed to hack high level accounts with no clear connection between them.",1,3,2015-04-20,EBAY,0.08899989724159241,0.8808618783950806,0.0301381666213274
Ebay,Is posting a smartphone IMEI/MEID number bad idea?,"Hey I was wondering if it's a bad idea to post the IMEI/MEID number either in a picture or text in the body of the auction for a smartphone? I have a T-mobile Galaxy S2 listed with the numbers shown in the pics and I did it at first as a BIN/ BO. I kept getting really lowball offers (at least IMO) considering that other phones in better condition were selling in the 120 range and I had my phone for 100 BIN. Lowest was 50 and the highest was 65. I told all 3 or 4 offers that I would take 75 and then they would walk. One of the buyers mentioned something about it being only good for parts but his txt-speak or general poor english made it difficult to fully understand what he meant. The BIN listing had around 300 views, maybe 1 watcher and the 3 or 4 offers but ended without a sale. I now have it as a auction starting at 49.99 and have one bidder, 5 watchers and ~120 views after a 3 days. I thought that there would be more action on it than there is. Now I'm second guessing having the IMEI/MEID numbers shown. I did it so a potential buyer would be able to verify that the numbers are clean on their own and not have to blindly trust my word. I have rad a few threads that seem to go back and forth on whether or not to post the numbers. Something about being able to clone a blacklisted phone using a clean number. Is this crap true? Did I screw myself on this one due to ignorance.

Ebay,"Sold a keyboard, got a chargeback but PayPal denied them the chargeback. Now sitting at post office. What now?","I sold this mechanical keyboard on ebay last week some time, $175 was the total price. The day after I ship it, the buyer tries to do a chargeback  (""Unauthorized access to account"") but PayPal immediately denied it to them, saying they could find no evidence of such.  I shipped with signature confirmation, but nobody was apparently there to sign for it, so it got sent to the post office to wait.

I'm assuming they will just wait out the 15 day waiting period before it's sent back, and then get a refund from me. But I'm still a little curious/worried.. Are there other options they could try to use to do a chargeback?  Or could they screw me over some way or another?  I mean, the buyer messaged me quite a bit after buying it, seemingly excited about buying it and asking when it would ship and all that.  So there's at least evidence that the person using that account planned on buying it.  But I don't know how eBay works in this sort of situation.

There's also the possibility they'll just go get it and request a return/refund. I've never had that happen before; do they need to have a reason for returning it or can they just specify any reason (or none at all)?

I worry a bit about them possibly taking the package and claiming it was empty (though I have a receipt with the particular weight/etc on it from when I shipped it at the post office), but I just don't know what to expect now.  Anybody else been in this sort of situation?

Ebay,Received purchase but different from photo that was shown in sale.,"Just wanted to ask everyone's opinion over something I just purchased on ebay.  It only cost $1.79 so I feel stupid asking. 

Purchased some ribbon roses from a seller. Photograph they have shows various colors in the lot, all very pretty and exactly what I was looking for to use.  I received totally different colors, not at all pretty so I left a good review regardless but said in the comment field 'great quality, but colors not as depicted"". No where on the item for sale did it say the colors would be different.  

I received an email from the seller admitting they ran out of stock of most colors and sent me what they had left in stock. Would I like a refund or replacement?  I said no to refund but said I appreciated a replacement as the colors I received I wouldn't use. 

Today I get a message from seller saying I have 24 hours to change the review to excellent then they will send me the replacement purchase. 

I feel I am being bullied and sort of threatened. Change it or you don't get it type of thing. 

I am wrong? Should I change the review?  I feel it's so much bullshit for something that cost $1.79, but it's the principle that is pissing me off.

Ebay,"Your defects CAN be removed, despite what an eBay customer service representative may have told you.","1 hour and 3 minutes.. and 4 eBay customer service representatives later.. I finally got (another) defect removed.

This time, a buyer left positive feedback with the message, and I quote, ""Item as described and shipped quickly! Thank you!"". But for whatever reason, she left me low DSR for item as described, and the transaction was marked as ""defective"". Putting eBay's flawed rating/defect system aside, that's just total bullshit on the buyer's part. This is the third time this has happened to me.

So I begin the defect removal process with eBay. The first 3 representatives (all women) are completely unsympathetic and tell me there is nothing they can do, even though I explain to them that i've had 2 defects for the EXACT same reason removed in the past due to the buyer's positive comment contradicting their low DSR review. The fourth rep was male; Indian. With a little bit of sweet-talking, and a few compliments, he granted my defect removal within 4 minutes.

tl;dr: If you get a defect, fight it. If it gets denied, re-appeal it. If eBay wants to have shitty policies in play, then I say it's time we put their customer support team to work.

Ebay,"eBay is asking my buyer to return items to me after I shipped them the wrong items, received them back, then shipped the correct items.","The buyer simply wanted the correct items. They ordered 5 brand new, consumable items from me in a listing that has since been removed, and I initially sent the wrong variety to them. 

The buyer opened a case and we figured out together that I shipped the wrong variety (brown instead of red). I told the buyer to simply send the incorrect brown items back to me and not only will I provide them with the correct red items, I will reimburse them $30 of their $99.95 order (free shipping, cost ~$10 to ship back to me) to cover their return shipping costs and as a gesture of good will.

The buyer returned the brown items and I immediately shipped the correct red items. They were delivered and I haven't heard anything from the buyer. Fast forward one month and I'm getting emails from eBay regarding the open case and I ask the buyer if there's a way that they can let eBay know that they sent back the incorrect items and received the correct ones so that I may issue them the $30 refund. My funds are being held this entire time and my only option is to approve a full refund, not a partial refund.

I still don't hear anything back from the buyer after a week, so I escalate the ""dispute"" to eBay so that they can close it and I can give the buyer their extra $30. I even tell eBay, ""The original payment was $99.95 and the buyer should receive $30 back."" eBay asks for the tracking information for the second shipment and I give it to them. 5 days goes by and now I get an email saying, ""This case has been decided in the buyer's favor.""

""The buyer has been asked to return the item to you. Once tracking shows the item has been delivered to you, the buyer will be issued a full refund. Also, if the buyer uses an eBay provided shipping label to return the item, you will be required to pay for such shipping and will see this charge on your invoice in accordance with our policies. These charges vary.""

The buyer got the items they wanted and eBay is getting in the way of me giving them $30 back. The items the buyer bought are most likely consumed by now and there's no way for the buyer to even return the items to me unless they buy brand new ones to return to me. What is going to happen if:

Ebay,Should I refund buyer difference in shipping cost?,"I was getting confused on why eBay was charging the buyer much higher than the shipping cost I was paying to ship the buyer's item.  At first I thought eBay's shipping calculator had a bug.

So the shipping cost the buyer paid was $24.95.  Shipping cost for me was supposed to be $15.27.
However, when I created the listing, the dimensions of my package was off by an inch on two sides so the cost that the buyer should have paid was $20.05.  I paid $12.99.

Ebay,"Sold a Laptop computer, buyer requested a return, sent back a different (lesser) computer","Now that this has happened to me, I am realizing that this is a common occurrence.

I recently sold a Macbook on ebay. The buyer requested a return, claiming that the Apple Store told him that the GPU was faulty. It sounded suspicious to me, but I accepted the return (but I haven't refunded the money yet).

I received the return computer, and it is VERY clearly a different computer from the one I initially sent. Several dents that were clearly document in my listing pictures were gone and the serial number on the home screen is different than the one from the computer I sent. The only thing about the computer that is the same is the bottom. It appears that the buyer swapped the bottom of the computer with the bottom of a lesser, defective computer and sent that back to me. I know this because the serial number on the bottom is the one from my original computer, but it does not match the serial number on the screen on the computer that was returned to me. 

I have contacted ebay and explained the situation. I have also filed a police report and an IC3. I have a plethora of pictures and videos documenting the differences between the items, as well as a witness who can attest to both the condition of the item that was mailed and the one returned. The witness would be willing to sign an affidavit.

Where do I stand? I informed the buyer that I will not be refunding him, and he has obviously denied everything and painted himself as a victim (trying to get back to work, I'm hurting his family, etc). Unfortunately, he has quite a bit more feedback than me. 

Is there anything else I can do to prevent myself from getting completely screwed over? It sounds like eBay almost always sides with the buyer in these cases.

Ebay,ebay's new fee schedule may very well kill my business,"my husband and i sell trading cards on ebay for a living. up to this point our selling model has been to list 100-150 cards a week, all auction-style. this not only ensures that all of our items end at the same time, allowing us to package and ship en masse, it allows for the occasional bidding war boosting an item's price higher than we would otherwise expect. we even signed up for an ebay store to get the 500 free listings a month, and so far it has been somewhat beneficial.

we just found out that ebay is dramatically changing the fees for ebay stores to the point that we may not be able to sustain a business at all. it sounds like now you only get a certain number of free listings IF your items sells, at which point ebay refunds the listing fee - problem is, we have no idea which cards will sell on a week-to-week basis. we have a few loss-leaders that we list at a penny for visibility reasons, but they never get bid up to the point of profitability and the rest, who knows what someone will decide to buy in any given week. i've seen cards get relisted for months on end, no one buys at $10, and then one week suddenly there's a bidding war and it sells for $25. we simply cannot afford to pay listing fees for items that don't sell every single week - the final value and paypal fees alone are eating up a substantial chunk of our profit. but we can't move to a different site because when buyers are looking for this type of item, they look on ebay almost exclusively. are there any other options that would continue to support our current selling model on ebay? between this, and ebay's psychotic seller standards, it really seems like ebay just wants its sellers to be robots that dump millions of dollars a month into their laps.",29,5,2015-04-23,EBAY,0.05134200677275658,0.9102697372436523,0.03838823735713959

Ebay,IAmA former PayPal employee and moderator of /r/eBay. AMA,"Short and sweet:

I worked for PayPal from March 2011 to December 2013. During my time there, I took phone calls in the Fraud/Limitations segment for about a year and the remainder was in the Compliance Department where I conducted investigations and submitted reports to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). I dealt heavily with eBay transactions as most of PayPal payments were from eBay auctions. 

I signed an NDA as part of my resignation but that has since expired. Even with that said, I will not divulge personal identifiable information (PII) or expose company secrets that I may be privy to. Just because my NDA has expired, doesn't mean the reign of lawyers can't crash down on me.

I'm posting this for a family member as I don't use ebay myself anymore.

An item was purchased via buy it now with a shipping rate quoted of 
$20, everything was immediately paid for via Paypal.

The next morning the buyer received a message from the seller saying there had been a mistake in the shipping cost and that it would be ""significantly higher"", and requested that the buyer call them to ""make arrangements"". The buyer did not immediately reply or contact them.

A few hours later the buyer receives a message on ebay informing them the seller has cancelled the sale due to ""item out of stock or can't fulfil the order for some other reason"".

After logging into their ebay account for them, it looks like it's impossible to leave ANY sort of feedback on this transaction. It shows up as an 'Unpaid Item' and there is no option to leave feedback for the transaction from the drop down menu. 

My understanding was there isn't much else we can do except leave negative feedback - but we cannot even do that. I was under the impression the sale could only be cancelled if the buyer accepts the request? There was no such request - just a message it had been cancelled.

Ebay,Looking for clarification about eBay Store subscriptions and FVFs on high value items.,"I was looking into subscribing to a store a while ago but lost interest in what seemed like a losing proposition based on my frequency of sales and the minimal FVF savings (I only list in Jewelry &amp; Watches). 

When eBay applied the last fee update, they removed the max $250 FVF cap and increased it to a $750 cap, which completely screwed me as a majority of my items are &gt;$2500. 

For kicks and giggles I decided to look into the store subscriptions again today, and it looks like store subscribers have that $250 cap reinstated while non-subscribers still get hit with up to $750. 

Can any store subscribers that sell high value items confirm this for me? Only saving 1% on FVFs didn't make it worth the subscription price for me before, but if this lower cap is indeed included with a Store one or two sales will make it pay for itself for the whole year.

Ebay,Seller provided fake return address to avoid a refund.,"I received an item that broke in transit and the seller refused to let me return the item. I opened a case and it was closed in my favor, allowing me to return the item for a refund. The seller got ugly when the case was closed and he sent me a vulgar, abusive message.

I looked up the address the seller gave me, and it was a fake address in a different town and zip code than the seller's real address (I have the real address on file from previous communications).

eBay says that they will refund me once my item shows as delivered. What should I do to get my refund?

I'm afraid if I send it to the fake address, it will show up as an undelivered and my refund will not happen. Should I mail it to the Post Office in the town of the return address so that I can have valid proof of tracking and delivery in that zip code?
Or would eBay still accept it if I sent it to his real address, even if it's not the one given.
Or should I just call eBay? I already called them once today to report the seller for his abusive messages, I'm not sure if I should call them again.

I would really appreciate anyone's insight on this.",11,3,2015-04-27,EBAY,0.07829606533050537,0.8874804377555847,0.034223463386297226

Ebay,Very confused about how to ship items,"i've been reading and trying to grasp the process of shipping an item, packaging it, printing labels, and sending, but im having a tough time understanding exactly how. this is my first time selling on ebay so please help me figure this out for shipping this and future items.

for example...

i just listed my item on ebay: two brand new basketball shorts. NOW, for the SHIPPING OPTION i picked ""CHARGE ACTUAL COST.""

i dont have a scale so i estimated that the package is 3-4 lbs for both shorts combined.

im not sure what to put for the LENGTH x WIDTH x HEIGHT. it defaulted as 7 x 4  x 4 inches. And the TYPE as PACKAGE or THICK ENVELOPE.

Now for SERVICE, it was default USPS PRIORITY MAIL and I left it at that. The estimated cost is $7.55-18.65. 

and i picked NO INTL. SHIPPING.

I understand that you can order free boxes from USPS if you choose priority mail, correct? how do i know which box to pick? the item is listed at 7 x 4 x 4 and there is no box that has those exact dimensions. The bigger the box the more the postage costs, right?

When i end up selling the item i also understand that ebay gives me the option to print the label directly from the ebay page. once i figure out which box size to use i just tape the label onto the box and schedule a pick up from usps and then im done, correct?

Sorry if this is too basic but ive been researching alot and since this is my first time selling, i hope i can get some insight in how to do this correctly. Thank you very much in advance !",16,2,2015-04-27,EBAY,0.020198162645101547,0.9258655905723572,0.05393628776073456

They said the buyer would have to provide evidence like documentation from Nike that proves they are fake.  After the case was decided my brother called and Ebay told him that the buyer provided evidence but can't tell him what it was. So, I looked at the Nike.com page about fakes and it says, ""Nike isn't able to respond to specific questions about product authenticity."", so that proves he didn't get evidence. Then I  called them about this and told them Nike doesn't provide evidence, so they told me they automatically sided with him and he didn't need to provide evidence.

* I called Ebay and they said the reason he could do this is he registered his account with a US Ship-to address during the auction, but then changed it after winning the auction.
* The rep led me to another menu in Ebay Site Preferences where you can specifically exclude countries, so supposedly, I am no double-protected.  It never occurred to me I'd have to go to this extra step.

Ebay,1st time a buyer has requested a return/refund.,"Hi there!  First time poster here.  Hoping some of you might be able to shed some light on a situation I just went through.


I have been selling casually on eBay for the past 5 years or so.  Have rarely ever ran into any problems with buyers.  On 4/3/2015, I sold a brand-new, factory-sealed copy of NBA 2K15 for the PS4.  I did not offer returns on the listing.  I shipped it at the post office in an official bubble mailer that I purchased @ USPS.  Package was delivered on 4/8/2015.

Shortly after delivery, I received positive feedback from the buyer that read, ""great deal"".

Yesterday evening (4/28/2015), I received an e-mail alert stating the buyer was requesting a return for reasons as follows:

""Return reason: It's defective or doesn't work.
Comments: The game is not working at all.  I need a replacement or a refund.""

I called eBay customer service last night before bed, and the CSR basically told me that due to the circumstances, the fact that they already gave me positive feedback, and the fact that they are filing for a refund nearly a month later, that I am not required and should not provide a refund or return for the item.


I messaged the buyer the following in response this morning:

*""Hello,

Thank you for contacting me about this item.  This item was sold on 4/3/2015 and reportedly delivered on 4/8/2015.  You had previously left positive feedback regarding this item.

As explained in the listing, this item was brand-new and factory-sealed.  The sealed game was shipped in-box in a USPS-official bubble mailer to avoid damage in transit.  There should be no defects.  The listing also states that seller does not offer refunds.

eBay customer service has already been contacted, and they have informed me that I am not required to provide a refund or replacement.  Thank you.""*

Ebay,Being cheated on Ebay right now... Can anyone help me?,"Backstory: Sold an item for $200 through global shipping program. Buyer claims key items are missing and wants to return. I say, no, I included everything, if you truly didn't receive the item then it was carrier tampering, and since it went through GSP, it's your responsibility to file a claim with them. I am not going to accept a return and refund and lose those expensive items. He conceded that it was not my fault. I told him to file a claim with the carrier several times and he ignores me. He opens a case. Then I get message from support saying: ""I understand that your buyer has opened a case because the item they received is not as described. I'm more than happy to assist you in resolving this case.

 

After reviewing the details of the case, I see that you are required to pay for the shipping charges associated with returning this item. We want you to be successful as a seller on eBay, so as part of an effort to build trust and engagement with potential buyers, we made a change in September 2014 which requires sellers to pay for return shipping any time an item is not as described. This will create a retail-like returns experience that will ultimately drive more sales for you as a seller.

 

To allow you and your buyer to find a return shipping solution that is satisfactory for you both, we have put this case on hold for 5 days.

 

The options we recommend are to send your buyer a prepaid return shipping label or to send your buyer money through PayPal to cover the cost of return shipping. You can also issue a full refund to the buyer without requiring a return, which will close the case; this can be done from the Resolution Center.

 

There are several benefits to you resolving this case on your own:

    You'll provide a better buyer experience, which may result in better Feedback and detailed seller ratings.
    This won't count as a “case closed without seller resolution” towards your seller performance standards.
    PayPal funds for the sale, which are placed on hold when a case is opened, will be released and applied to the refund.
    Your eBay and PayPal fees will be automatically credited to your account when you issue a refund.
    If you haven't resolved this issue before the hold is released, eBay will be forced to take the following actions:
    We'll close the case in the buyer's favor and will not require them to return the item. 
    We'll count this as a “case closed without seller resolution” towards your seller performance standards.
    We'll refund the buyer and then seek reimbursement from you.
    You won't be eligible to receive a credit for eBay and PayPal fees.

 

I’m confident this email explains the importance of working with your buyer to resolve the issue of return shipping costs.

SO am sending a reply to this message saying:  ""Hello. I included all items in the package. I did everything I was supposed to. Buyer claims pieces are missing so that means one of two things. 1) He is lying. 2) Carrier tampering. Buyer conceded that the item arrived in box. I sent my items in priority padded envelope which can be proven by looking at my shipping label. I sent the items through global shipping program which means someone indeed opened and transferred the items. Buyer agreed with me that this is carrier tampering. Buyer agreed that it is not my fault. I instructed him that he needs to file a claim through the proper channels. I told him 3 times and he has not shown any indication that he has tried. He should have closed the case. Not force me to refund money. I am an individual, not a business. If I am forced to refund or ""reimburse"" then I am getting the short end of the stick. I am being cheated. Again, this went through the global shipping program which means that I am not responsible for items undelivered. It states clearly in the policy. I have read it several times. So, you should either re-instruct the non-compliant buyer to file his claims with the carriers, or Ebay, the BILLION dollar company can refund him, not me, the poor man. Please explain how I could have handled this differently to prevent the item being stolen by the carrier. Thank you very much.""

Any suggestions will be appreciated, thanks",3,4,2015-04-30,EBAY,0.016827747225761414,0.8817107081413269,0.10146155953407288
Ebay,Need opinions on this ebay claim I'm dealing with.,So I sold something to a person and I get a message from the buyer a month later saying that he checked the tracking and when he went to his mailbox (lives in an apartment) he said the mailman wasn't his usual mailman and says it was delivered to the wrong box and whoever received it kept it. He also says he was on the phone with both ebay and usps trying to resolve the issue but couldn't get to a solution and wanted to see what I could do on my side. I was able to get a insurance cheque on how much I claimed the items value but I wanted a second opinion on this. How do I know the buyer isn't lying about not receiving the item. My tracking says delivered. How do I know if he already has the shoes and wants his money back as well :/,4,3,2015-04-30,EBAY,0.04217730462551117,0.9154698848724365,0.04235278069972992
Ebay,"Help &amp; Advice on ""Shipping Low Value"" Items without tracking.",The cost price of some of my items vary btwn 25 cents to 99 cents &amp; i would sell them for btwn 75 cents &amp; $ 1.50. I do not want to provide tracking as it will not be worth it. What will be the shipping costs from 1 oz to 13 oz as all my items weigh less than 13 oz. Is there any table i can look into.

Ebay,I'm now below standard because I'm an idiot. Is there any recourse I can take?,"Back in December I screwed up and handed my wife a stack of items to ship out.  Consequently they never arrived, no tracking (no receipt, she didn't think it was important to keep), so I got a bunch of INR cases opened.  I apologized and offered refunds but pleaded with the buyers to wait a bit in case they showed up.

I finally relented and agreed to refunds.  My mistake was not pushing the button for the refund itself (I was hoping magically things would simply show up and I wouldn't lose my shirt).  Ebay closed the cases, refunded them and in one fell swoop, I got selling limits added and strikes set against me.

Seems to me, that now I'm effed for a whole year from the incident until the 4 bad transactions don't keep adding to my defect rate (as the year moves on, my rate goes up due to fewer sales because I'm being penalized).

What can I do to not suck for a whole year?  Is there anything I can prove/request?",7,2,2015-04-30,EBAY,0.19173738360404968,0.7700278759002686,0.03823471814393997

Ebay,Returning an item on eBay issue,"Hello

I purchased a rare trading card on eBay and the seller did not package this card in any reasonable manner. The standard for shipping cards usually includes mailing it enclosed in a soft plastic sleeve to protect the cards surface from scratches and a hard plastic sleeve to protect the card from bends and creases. 

Long story short, the seller sends the card in a bubble envelope with the card wrapped around A4 paper with the soft sleeve from Russia to Canada and the card arrived with a huge crease on it.

The seller offered a refund when I return the card except this is where the problem begins.

As far as I am aware, the cheapest shipping method to ship this card back to Russia is going to cost substantially more than the card itself is worth. eBay insists that I send this with tracking and said that it would be the seller's responsibility to refund me the cost of postage. 

I have a feeling that what might happen is that if I return the card, it will be difficult to reclaim the shipping fees from the seller since they will be understandably very unhappy because it makes no economic sense to do so.

I am at a loss as to what to do here. The eBay representative would not tell me anything useful and insisted on following her script. She would consistently refer to me as the seller and refer to USPS, I would interrupt her and say I am located in Canada, and that I am the buyer, she would then start her script again from the top ignoring what I said until I gave up.

I have initiated a return request and linked the seller to Canada Posts shipping rates and warned the seller that shipping is more than the item is worth.

What should I expect to happen from here?

P.S.
Maybe I am just using CanadaPost incorrectly? The cheapest option I can find that will allow me to ship to Russia with tracking is going to cost nearly 100 dollars on an item worth about 60.",4,2,2015-04-30,EBAY,0.024908356368541718,0.9203838109970093,0.054707881063222885
