Ebay,PSA: If a guaranteed delivery item arrives late for any reason eBay will give you a $5 voucher with a few clicks.,"For those that aren't aware. 

https://imgur.com/a/IzCDHZj

If an item is late go to order details -&gt; report delivery issue -&gt; $5 voucher. 

Since the post office is really backed up this time of year a lot of guaranteed delivery items are arriving late. I have already gotten $25 in credits since thanksgiving. There is no limit to the amount of credits and you can use multiple at once.

Until 2019 eBay will give a $5 credit for any reason. In 2019 I think only if it's not the seller's fault. 


edit: it has to be **GUARANTEED delivery only** from sellers that offer that. It is not the estimated delivery. When you search you can filter for guaranteed delivery items or it will say ""Guaranteed by"" on the listing.",24,37,2018-12-01,EBAY,0.0757061243057251,0.8990666270256042,0.025227230042219162
Ebay,Bought a lightly used Nike Windbreaker for my son- and it smells like stale cigarettes. Just curious if it’s something I should complain about or suck it up and forget it?,"UPDATE BELOW:

As title says- it was only $20, and its clearly meant for a small adolescent size kid.(My sons 13, and it will probably barely fit him for long.)  But what bothers me is how much it reeked of stale cigarettes. I’m washing it now so hopefully it can help dilute the smell- but my question to everyone here- would you complain to the buyer or ebay? It never did say “smoke free home” and I’ve never complained like this and not sure its worth it- but wasn’t sure if I’m wrong? I’ve had my account since 2005, and have only bought items, never sold- so not sure if its worth the argument? I’m sure washing it means I cant return it, even though it was used, but again just curious what everyone thinks? Other than the smell- its in great condition for used. But if I can’t get the smell out I’m definitely not giving it to him. 

UPDATE:
Just received this message- 
“Hello, 
I am sorry you are not pleased. I issued you a full refund. If the item eventually represents value to you send me the appropriate amount back. “

I’m gonna be honest with him- if smells better I’ll pay, if not- I’ll at least return it. 

He does have a 100% rating- with over 8500 items sold, so I’m glad i didnt jump the gun —cry, complain and leave a bad feedback. 

Thanks for all the input though!",36,28,2018-12-01,EBAY,0.04912734031677246,0.8997060060501099,0.05116667598485947

Ebay,"eBay item sold. New random username; Buyer name doesn't match paypal shipment name, etc.","Hi Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I sold a Nintendo Switch today.  The buyer has zero feedback and it's a new username (literally REMOVED) as of today so the user obviously has zero feedback.  The buyer's name via eBay and the PayPal name are totally different (not necessary a red flag).  She paid promptly via PayPal and they have a confirmed address.  However, that confirmed address in NY also seems to be the address of a Duane Reade pharmacy.  I checked Street View in GMaps and there are no apartments at this address.  My sale is Seller Protection eligible via PayPal.  Should I worry or just ship?  Should I add Signature Confirmation?  I was already planning on insuring it.  Thoughts?

Ebay,Well thank goodness I don't have 100% feedback any more.,"Of the years I've sold on eBay, I'd say we had 100% feedback for about 5 months total... and basically 99.9% the rest of the time. There's always one.

Most recently regained 100% in September, and it's been a nonstop onslaught of scam/feedback extortion since. I've had more 'partial refund' requests in the last 2 months than I can recall ever before.

Most are very careful to strongly imply a neg, but avoid feedback extortion overtly - a sure sign they 'know what they're doing' IMHO. Apparently the phrase that ""slides under the bar"" with eBay these days is ""I wanted to reach out to you before leaving feedback."" It must be out there somewhere on the ""how to scam sellers"" boards 'cuz about 2/3 of them used it nearly word-for-word.

That 100% is like a flame to a moth!

My response is always ""Oh my goodness, I'm sorry to hear that, you're welcome to return it for a full refund."" Most go away, but one of 'em has made good on the threat: We're back to 99.9%... with our standard one negative feedback among thousands. And from a dude with a history of negs... I'd have blocked him in a second if I'd had a way to do that or ""look him over' before doing business. Sigh.

I could -maybe- even have it removed. His feedback text says ""didn't work"" but in his messages to me he clearly says it DOES work. 

But I don't think I'm even gonna try. Let the moths move on to someone else with 100% to ""protect"".

I have, however, ditched the Global Shipping Program. GSP sales are maybe 10% of my revenue, and I hate to give that up. But they're 90% of my ""problem buyers"" and I've had enough.",21,36,2018-12-02,EBAY,0.06355401128530502,0.9003483057022095,0.036097656935453415

I am resisting the temptation to stoop down to their level and am maintaining my nice ""customer service"" attitude in the hopes of not getting a negative, but it's hard sometimes. REALLY hard.

Ebay,"Ukrainian buyer used Jersey reshipper. Claims I mailed box of trash, not a laptop. Filed a return. eBay wants me to file police report to proceed. Police refuse to take one or talk to eBay. Now what?","I sold a $400 laptop about a week ago. It shipped to a New Jersey address. About a day after confirmed delivery, the buyer opened a return request, claimed the box was filled with garbage (literally) and demanded a refund.

I allowed them to return the box - which I guess was a huge mistake. Indeed I was shipped back a box filled with garbage.

I then opened up the transaction to look a little closer. It turns out the buyer is in the Ukraine, and the address they had me ship to (NOT the address registered to the ebay account) is, when googled, a reshipping company in America that is associated with hundreds of reports of fraud. Most are nearly identical to my situation: a person in Ukraine or Russia who claims an item is not as described or never received. In many cases people report that it turns out the ebay account used was hacked/stolen.

The ebay account in question was opened in 2011 but has only 4 feedback, with no real recent activity, which lends itself to the idea that it was probably stolen or hacked. The name of the account is also a real person's name, very different from the name of the buyer (not the real names, but like the ebay account is named ""Jerry_Smith123"" but the package went to ""Vladamir Brovslakskow"".)

So, thinking I have an open and shut case here, I called ebay to ask them to investigate the buyer (who has already left me negative feedback, by the way.) The first person I talk to puts me on hold to investigate the issue, spends about 5 minutes doing that, and comes back and says she absolutely agrees that it is a clear cut and dry case of fraud that should be easy to resolve. She says she needs to put me through to a different department (I don't remember what it was, but it was NOT Trust &amp; Safety).

The woman in that department also puts me on hold to investigate. Then she comes back and says that because I accepted the return, if I am claiming what was returned to me is not what I mailed out, I will have to file a police report to continue a more in-depth investigation that can take up to 10 days.

So I'm thinking...are you serious? It's so cut and dry! And she says she agrees that it is very obviously fraud, and that the buyer is not entitled to a claim because claims are void if you use a third party shipping company, but because I already accepted the return, the only way to proceed is with a police report.

So the next day I went in to the police station to file a report. It took forever, and I finally sat down with a detective. After explaining the situation he said there is really nothing that they can do. He says because the person in question is located in a foreign country, it would be handled by the FBI or even Interpol, but that they would not be taking a report.

So I call eBay again, and the new rep says if that is the case, I need to call eBay while I am at the station and then ask the officer to speak to the eBay representative while I have them on the phone. So I went back to the station, and I was allowed to see the same detective. I told him this and he said no. Flat out, he said he's not going to do it.

So what in the hell am I supposed to do at this point?",21,11,2018-12-02,EBAY,0.14608819782733917,0.8305912017822266,0.023320626467466354
Ebay,"Help - Selling book, realized condition is worse after someone used ""buy it now""","I sold a 10-volume set of Hardcover books via ""buy it now"". I had described the set as very good condition. However, after the sale, I inspected more closely and found pencil marks on some pages, names written on the inside covers of a few books, one inside-cover illustration is scribbled on in pen, discoloration on the outside page edges (the books are from the 1950s so maybe this is normal). The point is the set is not really very good condition. I think it would be considered good condition by eBay's guidelines.

The buyer already paid. What should I do? Should I message them with pictures and tell them they can cancel, or offer them a reduced price? Should I just cancel the sale? I don't want to just ship it. I think the buyer would not be satisfied.

Edit: Thanks for the help. I told the buyer what happened and told them to let me know whether they still want the item or want to cancel the transaction. I included photos of the defects. The buyer chose to cancel the transaction. I canceled the sale through my Sold listings page and marked the cancellation as ""buyer wants to cancel"". The cancellation status page let me issue a refund after the buyer confirmed the cancellation.

I believe marking the cancellation as buyer-initiated prevents eBay from dinging me and prevents the buyer from leaving negative or neutral feedback.",11,10,2018-12-02,EBAY,0.11291762441396713,0.8531862497329712,0.03389616310596466

Ebay,Ebay tales involving real-estate,"I've been buying up a bit of land here and there, a few dwellings here and there and have done so mostly with eBay this year.

I've found the experience to be both smooth and bumpy, it depends on the seller and other paperwork.

As a warning eBay doesn't provide a money back guarantee with it's real estate sales, but I've found most of the sellers to be honest and quick enough about the paperwork and such.

This year during the summer, I picked up an apartment and a house in Europe, the house which has a mortgage, and that was fairly easy to do it went quite smoothly.

During my vacation, I attempted to buy a house in the US, this house was fraudulently portrayed as being in move in condition, it wasn't. Had to file fraud related paperwork with the real estate authorities within two states for that.

After vacation, I bought three properties, land only in the US, which widely varies in terms of time to process paperwork, but I've received two of them whole and healthy. I'm still waiting on another, but that should arrive within the next few weeks. It's taken from 1 to 3 months all on all for the deed process.

Ebay,"Dispute raised around faulty goods, a refund is given by ebay. What to do with goods?","My father purchased an exercise machine off via ebay auction and collected it in person the same day. After setting it up straight away the item would switch off after less than a minute of running. After a bit of digging it's a common fault with the unit, that degrades through several steps before reaching the failure point it is at now (so it's not likely this is something that developed in transit) and the belief is the seller knew about this. 

He immediately contacted the seller, who basically said tough luck. There were several emails back and forth, with the seller becoming quite hostile and not willing to accept a return or refund. 

A dispute was raised with ebay and after some further back and forth, ebay found in favour of my Father. They gave the seller to a certain day organise a return and refund, which they completely ignored. After which ebay refunded my Father the full amount (which I'm guessing they automatically took or will seek from the seller via collections). 

Several days later my father got an email from the seller requesting that he return the item to the previous address, and the seller would personally give him the refund in cash, although he was already awarded this through ebay.

He doesn't want to return the item.

A) The seller has been openly hostile in communication, so he does not feel safe returning to the seller or having the seller come to his address.

B) He believes the seller will refuse to give him the money in cash, but claim otherwise.

C) ebay has given no guidance on what to do with the item, so he believes he is in his right to dispose of it.

D) He believes if he returns it, the seller will just try to scam someone on another website.  

He's tried to get advice from ebay, but the case has now been closed and can't be re-opened. 

Just wondering what is the best option here? He's got his money back and still has the faulty goods.

Ebay,"What kind of shipment delays should I expect, or have others seen themselves, because of the Canada Post strikes?","Hello, I recently bought a cell phone from the US on Ebay, and I've been wondering if anyone knows what I can expect after my package leaves Erlanger. I know that any arrival estimate Ebay or any tracking sites give me has a massive asterisk next to it because of the Canada Post strikes, so it would be nice if they could be avoided altogether, but I don't think this is the case. Is it guaranteed that Canada Post will resume shipment after my package gets to the border, or could it be handled by UPS, Purolator, etc.?

Mostly what I'd like to know is have people been getting their packages smoothly since the strikes started, or should I expect to not receive my package any time soon? I know Canada Post themselves have said international parcels may take up to March 2019 to be delivered, but I know that this probably depends on what hub your package gets to (like I've heard Vancouver is massively backlogged but Toronto has a much higher capacity for processing shipments, and I live in the GTA). I've been watching tracking updates like a hawk, and it's spent almost four business days in Erlanger without any updates, so I'm worried that Global Shipping Centre is holding it so as to not contribute to the shipping backlog. Could this be true?

Thanks a lot.

Ebay,Seller lied about accidentally breaking a vintage cologne I bought at a great price and is now selling it again,"I bought a vintage bottle of cologne for $70. By the batch code, I realized that it was an absolute steal, so I was thrilled. A couple minutes later, the seller emails me saying that their worker dropped and shattered the bottle, and even provided a picture of it shattered on the ground. Seemed a bit suspicious at the time, but there was nothing I could do.

Fast forward to a month later, and the same exact cologne was listed for $300. I was/am pretty pissed off. I don't blame someone for wanting to make more profit, but the lying part of it is pretty weak...I'm wondering if I should contact ebay to complain?

Ebay,eBay Fails To Review 31 Day Return Claim. Buyer Wins With Insufficient Evidence. Seller Appeal Ignored.,"Been a seller on eBay for 15+ years. Absolutely disgusted with eBay's handling of a recent return claim:

&amp;#x200B;

Buyer was claiming an Asus Graphics Card (GTX 1080 Ti) was running too hot.

Buyer uploaded a screenshot of a chat session they had with an Asus representative. The representative stated that the temps of 75-80 degrees were normal for this type of graphics card.

Buyer still makes claim.

The buyer uploaded a video to YouTube showing conflicting results with the card now reaching temps up to 91 degrees! This can be done easily with any overclocking software, such as MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision. You can disable/slow down the cooling fans, overclock, increase voltage, or even set a temperature limit.)

They provided no footage of the software configuration before stress testing the GPU...

I made all of this clear to eBay through my response to the claim.

eBay ignored me and ordered the item to be returned before the claim was decided. They told me I could appeal the claim when the item arrives, if I lose the claim... ?? (Not sure I really understand the process there.)

Item arrived (at my cost), but not faulty at all.

I appealed.

I provided a video showing the returned item working as it should, without any fault whatsoever. I also provided evidence from supplier showing temps were normal and card is not faulty.

No communication from eBay or buyer.

&amp;#x200B;

31 days holding my money, 5 days to respond to appeal and I get this:

eBay: ""We understand how frustrating it is that the item's condition changed but, unfortunately, we didn't receive proof that the buyer caused the issue.""

Excuse me? The item's condition changed? ... WHAT ISSUE ??

Ebay,Customer is claiming fraud because item hasn't arrived,"Hi all,
I shipped a perfume via USPS ground a few days ago and provided tracking, and it's expected to arrive the 5th. Now the customer messaged me and was upset that the item hadn't left the state yet (california to minnesota) so I did a partial refund through paypal to cover the shipping cost because its taking so long. Today they message me thinking they're being scammed because the package still hasn't left California and how could it possibly arrive to them tomorrow. They think I somehow treated the package as a return to sender and it's going back to me, which it isn't. I offered to refund them if the item still hasn't arrived by the 6th, and now they've opened up a buyer dispute, saying they're doing it as a precaution so they don't get scammed during the holidays. Will this affect my Ebay account negatively? I've had my account for twelve years and this is the first time its happened.

Ebay,Seller refuse to refund and asking for lawyer...,"Update: not gonna waste people time to read this post, but this is more like a precaution post to new eBay buyers who may face similar situation and panic in the future.


Ihave bought a ps4 pro from a new seller (probably just a one time seller with no selling record but just as buyer) on 22 Nov 2018 on ebay australia. I immediately paid through paypal (debit card). The seller then pm-ed me and asked if I'm ready to pay by bank transfer or paypal. I told him, I've already paid through paypal and asked him to accept the payment. He then just send me a link to his paypal probably expecting me to transfer to his other paypal account. I replied again saying I have already paid to him through ebay paypal and asked him to accept it, I won't transfer money to another paypal account.

&amp;#x200B;

He then accepts the payment in paypal and instantly marked the item as shipped in ebay. But then, he messaged me and said he will send the item after paypal payment is cleared in 1-5 business day. I said okay, send me a tracking number later. Few days went by, I ask him if the payment has cleared and if he has posted the item (I asked this on 28 Nov), he then replied he sent it on 27 Nov. So I asked him, please provide me a tracking number as I won't be at home next week, I need my friend to be ready for the delivery. he didn't reply.

&amp;#x200B;

Since he marked as shipped on 22 Nov, ebay estimated the delivery to be 28-29 Nov. But till today, 5 December, it's still not arrived. I went to Australia post website and check the estimated delivery since I know where the package comes from, by right if he posted on 27 Nov, I should get it around 3-4 December since it's domestic post. I messaged the seller to ask for update on the delivery or provide me a tracking number, else I will file INR by this friday if item still not here. He then said he posted over a week ago, and asked me go ahead file a case. I replied to him, if he posted it, why can't he provide me a tracking info? He did not reply!

&amp;#x200B;

So I filed INR case today asking for refund, since he refuse to provide me any tracking number. He then message me back with a solution and said this

""I sent it over a week ago I have no idea what a traffic number is I refuse to refund something I sent i will see my lawyer"".

I was like, WTF? is he trolling with me? traffic number? Does this guy even know how ebay works??

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I will just wait and ask for ebay to step in on 11 Dec. Any thoughts on this or advice is much appreciated.",30,22,2018-12-05,EBAY,0.04441915825009346,0.9163475036621094,0.03923337906599045

Ebay,"Purchased A Macbook, But Condition Not As Described- Should I File INAD Even Though Seller Offers Full Refund?","Edit: Opened an INAD case. Thanks for the help.

Edit 2: Decided against INAD. Did more reading up on it just before I was going to open a case, and learned that I could file a return for item not matching description or photos. I am not trying to screw the seller over, although I don’t think the seller is a reputable one and lied in the description listing. I simply want to ensure that I don’t get screwed over and get my full refund as I have already purchased a replacement MacBook from a different seller.

Edit 3: I’m stupid and INAD is the same as filing a return for item not matching description. Not going to go this route. I will take a lot of pictures before packing up the laptop and will use the sellers provided return label. If shit hits the fan, I’ll have eBay step in. Going to put my trust this seller will do right and provide a full refund. I will leave a neutral review for this seller though.

Hey y'all, so I bought a refurbished Macbook ($600) from a 4.5 star seller (89 sales). Laptop was advertised to be in 9/10 condition, but the laptop I received definitely was not in great condition. It had scratches all over the bottom and screen, a couple dents on the corner, missing rubber feet, and pits on the screen. 

I contact the seller to inform them of the condition of the laptop. They ask for pictures, which I provide, and then they proceed to offer a partial refund or a full refund- full refund will be contingent on their inspection of the laptop once received. I accept the full refund offer and they send over a return label. 

This is where I'm not sure how to proceed. An INAD case not been open with Ebay, but should I open one to further protect myself? I initially thought I would just slap on the return label and ship off the laptop, receiving my full refund once they complete their inspection of the laptop, but there's a little notion inside my head that's telling me to open an INAD case.

Apologies if this a no-brainer, but I haven't had to return an item before. Thanks for any insight.",20,8,2018-12-06,EBAY,0.05933545529842377,0.900972306728363,0.03969228267669678

Ebay,why doesn't eBay just require bidders to have a balance to cover their bid before they place one?,"I just tried selling something on eBay for the first time in several years, and it seems like there's a fairly obvious loophole that scammers are exploiting, so I wonder why eBay doesn't fix it.

 The exploit is that if you have listed an item to sell, a scammer can create a brand-new account and place a ""bid"" that they have no intention of paying, but in the message that goes with the bid, they send their phone number and email address (which is against eBay's rules). They urge you to contact them outside eBay's system so that they can arrange ""payment"" (which they will try to do by some fraudulent means). So even if you accept their bid, they still won't pay, and once you realize this, you have to cancel and start over.

But, the obvious fix for this is to require bidders to front the money before placing the bid. eBay is integrated with Paypal, so if you use Paypal to bid, require your Paypal account to have that balance before you bid the amount. Or, if you want to use a credit card, require bidders to fund their eBay account with a credit card so that they have a high enough balance for any bids they want to place. And then if your bid is accepted, eBay debits that money from your account and holds it for the seller. This would eliminate all of the bids where the seller has no intention of paying, while still enabling all of the legit ones. 

This seems so easy that I'm wondering if there is some reason that this fix still hasn't been implemented after 23 years, some reason that would be obvious to frequent eBay users?  Am I missing something?",25,3,2018-12-06,EBAY,0.06483304500579834,0.9056556224822998,0.029511310160160065

It is vintage so a receipt isn't around any more. If the buyer wanted a refund within the usual return window, I would have gladly obliged. But now, it's been over a year. I don't know the condition of the bag any more. I don't know if maybe they're swapping it out for a fake one. It doesn't seem fair that they contact me and want a refund after they get their usage of the bag and maybe grew tired of it.

Ebay,Buyer wants to return an item for missing parts/items that I NEVER said came with the item?,"Long story...

I sold my first item on eBay last week. It was a Fujifilm camera. I listed it as used and in my description, I wrote that there is “some cosmetic damage on the body and scratches on the screen, as shown in the photos” on my listing. I also listed what it came with, which was a strap, lens cap, lens hood, 2 batteries and a charger with a cable. I even took a photo of all of it to show interested buyers what’s included. And then I put the shutter count and specs, whatever. So this guy buys it and pays right away, then he pressures me to send it the next day. Before I packaged it up at the Post Office, I took photos of the process. Everything that I listed and were in the photos, I took pictures of while wrapping it up and putting it in a box. I even took a picture of the label once the lady taped it on the package. So he received the package 4 days ago and he thanked me for the fast shipping. I thought everything went fine. Then yesterday he requested for a return. He claims there were missing items/parts. This is his message: “Hi there, I d like to return the camera to you please. I did not realize that it did not come in the original packaging, it is also missing the original strap, USB cable and instruction manuals. There is also a fair bit more wear and tear on the body than I could tell from the photos.“

Again, I listed everything it came with in the description. I NEVER mentioned an original Fujifilm strap, USB cable, instruction manuals and original packaging. I also took photos of the camera in EVERY angle so they can see the flaws it has in all the photos. When I told him that, he said this: “I realize that, however your listing did not explicitly state what was not included from the original packaging so it was implied that it may very well ship with the box and remaining items. The description should have outlined the missing items such as the box, Fujifilm strap, USB cable and instruction manuals. I think it is best that we resolve this matter between ourselves”.

I’ve NEVER seen an eBay listing where they listed items that DIDN’T come with the item. I always see listings that state what it does come with, for example “comes with original box”, etc.

It took me awhile to make my first sale and it’s stressful that this is happening to me. He didn’t respond back yet after I sent him eBay’s description of a used item. But the funds I got from selling this camera are on-hold again on PayPal so I think he’s still going to try to proceed. Is there anything I can do?",6,12,2018-12-08,EBAY,0.03858007863163948,0.9276472330093384,0.033772699534893036

Ebay,So the SD card I posted about earlier apparently is a fake. There's a video out there claiming it is and the packaging matches the fake one. Seller says its legit. What do I do now?,"I made a Reddit post earlier asking if I got a fraudulent product, and I tried posting a video I found and a bot killed the post because it thought it was an advertisement so I'm posting a new one.

Anyways, it should be the first video titled ""400GB SanDisk Ultra MicroSDXC - Fake or Genuine?""

https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=Ni8MXJLPAoqVjwTKw4XwDg&amp;q=sandisk+400gb+fake

I have 2 SD cards, one I ordered from one seller, and another from someone else. 
The first one reported 390gb when plugged in. I kept adding files and the card would stop in the middle and tell me there's an error. The next time I plugged it back in, it would force me to format the card.
I've done this like 6 times, same thing every time.

I ran disk part on it, and it did nothing.

Second card reported 366gb. That's not 400gb but when googling 366gb, I have threads confirming that's the proper size because of GB to Gb advertisement that SD card companies are allow3d to shirk.

All files transferred fine. About 128 capacity used so far. Works great. Transfer speeds were around 50-100mbps as advertised.


The one with the card that doesn't work had sketchy packaging like the one in the video. No ""400gb"" logo on the top right. The backdrop image of the phone is positioned slightly different with the phones home button being blocked by the casing for the sd and adapter. And most of all THE PHONE IMAGE IS PIXELATED AND LOW RES almost ad if the image was downloaded and edited in.

The fonttypes are different on the packages as well. Some of the logos on the back are different. The upc is different.

So if there's a video already complaining about the product being fake, and it's reporting wrong capacity and not working, I must have a fake.

I have a problem though, the card snapped in half when I was trying to clean the pins as I was getting desparate to make it work. Great, so now I can't return it if it's damaged, but it was a fake product to begin with?

Is there anything I can do? I was literally scammed 100 dollars for something that is probably what, 10 dollars?",18,4,2018-12-08,EBAY,0.10647240281105042,0.8672609329223633,0.026266664266586304

Ebay,Stolen 8k worth device and eBay made refund to a buyer,"Hi everyone,

Need community help, because eBay showed to us zero support.  
 

I sold to a buyer equipment worth more than 8k, it was brand new electronic device. He negotiated price a little bit, we agreed, he paid and I shipped equipment via DHL express to USA. Normal procedure. Buyer had positive reviews  100+. Nothing suspicious.

Client received equipment, there was a small problem with activation, but we solved it asap. After few weeks I received message, that buyer is not satisfied with product, it does not work, does not power on, smell bad.  
 

I tried everything to understand what is wrong with a tool, offered warranty, but he was insisted to return it and asked for refund.  
 

Smell bad, does not power on. That’s it.  
 

He opened a case, I send to him DHL labels to send equipment back.  
 

Received equipment back destroyed. From first look there was missing parts and burned main connector on the outside of equipment. I opened in ebay a case “received item in different condition”. I made a list what is wrong with the item, I made photos. All this information was sent to ebay.  
 

Everything was ignored. Ebay approved a refund for a client. Spoke with eBay via phone for 1 hour with 7 different people, they said they can do nothing. All this information does not matter, buyer wrote it does not work.  
 

Buyer responded about missing parts: I do not know, everything is in the box.  
 

Sent an item which is worth 8k to manufacturer to investigate where was a problem and why it burned.  
 

And here when interesting part starts:

Manufacturer responded, that inside of equipment there is different parts, whole microchip is changed to another. It was dissembled. Only case is the same, everything inside of device is changed to an old burned exactly same item. They found old microchip’s serial number and they tracked this item was bought from them 1 year ago. Received from manufacturer official statement.  
 

So buyer is a thief.

I made a call to eBay, spoke half an hour with 3 different people. They can do nothing, I said I have a lot of proofs, but it doesn’t matter, because client must write to me a message and brag about how he stole everything and only then they can change decision about refund. They look only messages from buyer. Apparently buyer does not respond and as a criminal does not admit he made a crime. J  
   
 

Stolen equipment, left with impossible to repair burned device and  -8k in the bank.  
 

What should I do now?  
 

I wrote to police. Paypal is empy. I blocked my Credit-card and not made a refund.

Ebay,Beware of scammers: -600 in bank now because I tried to do the right thing.,"Yesterday I listed my iPhone X on eBay for a buy it now of 700 dollars.   
5 Hours later it was sold and the money was pending in my eBay acct. I was over the moon.   


I went to work, and looked up the buyers address and found out it was a scam address used for fraudulent purchases. So I canceled the listing. Thought PayPal would just refund the pending funds in my acct to him.   


I was wrong.  


Turns out the guy who purchased my item used a hacked paypal account. The person who actually owns said PayPal acct filed a claim through PayPal for an Unauthorized Purchase. PayPal in their infinite wisdom releases the funds into my PayPal instead of refunding him like I told them to. So when the refund processed it pulled from my bank acct instead of the PayPal balance. Now my acct is overdrafted until Friday...all during the holiday season.   


When I called PayPal they said there is nothing they can do.

Ebay,Do NOT let a buyer pay with paypal if locally picking up.,"I should've known, but I made the mistake of trusting people.

I had a guy come by to pick up a $260 VW car part on Halloween (10/31/18) that was listed as local pickup only. We had messages leading up to when we'd be meeting up and me giving him my address and everything. I marked it as shipped right after he sent payment and left him positive feedback. He didn't leave me any.

His first message after picking up the item was ""can I pay when I pick it up?"" which means that he was only going to pay when he picked it up. He paid through paypal upon pickup after asking if it'd be okay. I got the notification that he had paid (and he bought a second VW part while he was here in a second payment that he did not file a claim for). Turns out he paid through the Paypal app, not through eBay - which was another thing that he used to scam me. 

Anyway, Saturday December 8th (more than a month later) rolls around and I wake up to an email saying a chargeback has been filed. I submit all of our messages to Paypal showing that we had scheduled a pickup time at my home and transaction info showing that the money was sent at the time we were scheduled to meet, and the message showing that he wanted to pay when he picked it up. Even showed that he bought a second item a few minutes later and didn't file a claim for that.

Contacted the buyer via eBay. He ignored it.

Today Paypal emailed me to say I didn't prove that he picked it up. Buyer reported on eBay for abusing buyer protection policies, but I know that'll lead to nothing. 

I have the buyer's home address and he's not all that far away, but I know paying a visit would only open a can of worms.

Lesson learned. Do NOT, under any circumstance, accept a PayPal payment for an item that's picked up.",43,68,2018-12-12,EBAY,0.039130862802267075,0.9264801740646362,0.03438897058367729

Ebay,Random question about payments and PayPal holds,"Hi all,

I'm a pretty infrequent seller/buyer on eBay, so when I sell something, the payment is on a PayPal hold for a few days until the shipment goes through.  Yesterday, I sold 3 items, with two of those items being purchased by a single buyer.  His funds were made available to me immediately, while the funds from the other buyer of the third item are on hold until at least 12/25 (probably sooner, since I ship Priority Mail).

Both of the buyers have very high ratings, and I'm the odd one out with how few transactions I've done, so I'm curious as to why Buyer A's money came through instantly while Buyer B's money is in limbo.

2) Will the seller be notified that I have filed?",8,5,2018-12-12,EBAY,0.29874032735824585,0.6769694089889526,0.024290334433317184
Ebay,high number of user interface bugs,"As a very infrequent user of eBay trying to sell some unopened electronics, it seems like there is a very high number of bugs in the user interface, compared to similarly high-profile websites like Google or Hotmail.  I wonder if regular eBay users have the same impression, and if people just develop muscle memory around avoiding the pitfalls with the UI.  (I was trying to sell something while also accepting ""offers"" other than the Buy It Now price, which attracted fraudulent offers from accounts that were later deleted, so it's possible that some of the bugs only manifest themselves when you have bids on your items from accounts that were shut down, and maybe regular sellers who only use Buy It Now don't encounter these bugs.)

A partial list of the UI bugs I've encountered:

\- Under ""Selling Reminders"", all my counts are off by 1: ""I need to leave feedback for 2 items""; ""I am awaiting payment for 2 items""; ""Buyers have requested their payment total on 1 item"", but if I click through to each of those reminders, the list is 1 less than the number displayed (so the ""Buyers have requested their payment total on 1 item"" links to an empty list).  I assume this is because one of the ""winning bidders"" got their account shut down.  However, when you're using ""Selling Reminders"" as an *actual* to-do list (presumably what it's for), it's aggravating to have items in it that you can't remove.  (The actual tabs have the correct totals for ""Awaiting payment"", ""Awaiting feedback"" etc.: [https://imgur.com/a/PxQgDhJ](https://imgur.com/a/PxQgDhJ) )

\- For the item to I sold to the user who was later deleted, under ""More actions"" I can pick ""Relist item"", but after I submit the ""Relist item"" form, I get the error message:   
"" It looks like there's a problem with this listing. This item cannot be accessed because the listing has been deleted, is a Half.com listing, or you are not the seller.""   
[https://imgur.com/a/VeuJ4Et](https://imgur.com/a/VeuJ4Et)   
where none of those things are true.  (The listing wasn't deleted; the item was sold and then the *user* was deleted.  And in any case, if eBay can't re-list this listing, it should have displayed that limitation when I picked the option to re-list it, instead of waiting for me to fill out the form and submit it!)

\- Under ""More actions"", I can pick ""Sell similar"" and fill out the form, and I get the same error:   
[https://imgur.com/a/2Pao1Pm](https://imgur.com/a/2Pao1Pm)

\- As I mentioned, even when you get an ""offer"" that flagrantly violates the rules (containing email and telephone contact number information), there is no option to report the user:   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/a3t8im/does\_ebay\_not\_have\_an\_option\_to\_report\_a\_user/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/a3t8im/does_ebay_not_have_an_option_to_report_a_user/)   
Considering that this option is easy to find on Facebook, Reddit, and virtually every other site where you interact with other users, it should be present on the one site where the *majority* of messages I'm getting are from scammers.

\- Related, it should be easy for eBay to filter out email addresses and phone numbers from the text of offer messages.  (AirBnB and other sites do this if you try to send contact information in order to make a deal outside the system.)  A friend said eBay used to do this; well it's not working any more.

\- For the sale before that (also cancelled when I realized the buyer was a scammer), it shows up in my list of ""requests and cases"":   
[https://imgur.com/a/gp9cmZu](https://imgur.com/a/gp9cmZu)   
but if I click ""View purchased item"", I get directed to another page which eventually fails and redirects me to an error page on eBay's site (not a browser error) saying ""Page Not Responding"":   
[https://imgur.com/a/2m8vCGp](https://imgur.com/a/2m8vCGp)   
(This happens every time, even when the rest of eBay is working fine; this is a bug, not a temporary network error.)

\- The 1 item that does show up on my ""Leave feedback"" page is the sale where the buyer's user account was deleted.  But then if I do click the ""Leave Feedback"" button, it takes me to a blank page:

Ebay,Shop Airlines America fails at math.,"A lot of people have bad things to say about this company, but we've sold to them many times without issue. Today after many many orders they open the return request.

We sell electronic components. And we generally sell them in lots. A manufacturers tube of chips normally come in quantities of 18 25 or 50. This particular device we listed lots of 20 and the manufacturers tube comes with 50.  normally customers only order 1 lot of 20 which we cut the tube down to size. 

They ordered five lots of 20. So we simply cut two tubes in half and send it to them. We cut them in half so they could fit in the bubble envelopes. They sent pictures saying they were supposed to receive five lots and showed the four tubes with 25 pieces each. I may not be a calculus wizard but four tubes of 25 equal 100. Which is the same as five tubes of 20 pieces.

Their own pictures damn them but who knows I'll probably get an eBay rep who's just as bad at math . I'm not going to give them a partial refund, unless absolutely necessary.

Ebay,Why would a fraudulent order be sent to my house from my account?,"It seems my  ebay account was hacked/broken into last night and someone purchased an iphone.  All went well as far as a refund.  We contacted ebay and they are issuing us a refund back through paypay.  We were lucky to catch it very early, within hours and change all our passwords. They did a good job trying to hide it putting it in a hidden section of ebay orders I did not know existed.  I guess that is to keep presents to family members hidden when used correctly.  Luckily I had an email alert me to the purchase. The odd thing is that the iphone was being sent to our house overnighted.  I do not understand why they would send the item to my house and not another location.  I mean, what are the chances the hacker lives near me and was going to sit outside the house all day waiting on a fedex truck to show up.  Even though it seems at this point to be resolved I am curious if anyone has any idea whey the would send it to my house, is there some purpose or is this just someone's idea of a joke.

Ebay,"My ""Free Priority Shipping"" promo doesn't show up in search or on my listings (except for a small box at the top) - am I just wasting my money?","Normally I charge for all shipping and have Media Mail as the primary.

Ebay,Return on eBay,"Hi  


I ordered a musical instrument a couple of weeks ago. It hadn't arrived, so I contacted him through eBay saying I wanted a refund. He marked it as dispatched, adding a tracking number that didn't work.  
The seller sent a message saying the shop that he dropped the parcel off at had ""left it in the wrong pile"" so it hadn't been collected, and promising it would be sent that day. I told him I couldn't wait, and that I'd have to buy the instrument locally. I asked for prepaid returns label if he'd returned it.

He sent a message at nearly midnight last night, saying he's going to refund me by cheque as I went through eBay and the option to refund ""isn't in his Paypal account anymore"".

My instinct is to not contact him further until it's time to escalate (21st December), then go straight to eBay support. Or should I contact him and say I expect the refund to go back through Paypal? 

I like to think the best of people and I don't like the idea of yanking money from someone's bank account just before Christmas, but I don't think this person is being straight with me.

Despite that, I still didn't feel comfortable accepting a check and he sent me a scathing message in return basically saying I'm an amateur seller for not accepting checks and I don't have enough experience on ebay to understand how it works

I sold an Apple Watch (Buy it Now)  and the buyer only has 1 feedback (positive) but nothing else, Member Since 2018. I have already printed out the shipping label and packaged the watch before realizing This. I am concerned about shipping to them (don't want to be out 400.00). I thought I had limitations on my auction to prevent low feedback buyers but no way to verify that now. 

I sent the 1 feedback Buyer several messages but they still haven’t replied. Should I be worried ?? My guy instinct is telling me Don’t do it. 
 

Is there any more ways to protect yourself if buyer claims:



1. You shipped something else?

2. Item not as described?


It is marked as “ Seller protection
Eligible “ on PayPal.
 

I am definitely shipping this insured with signature upon delivery and tracking, any other tips would be appreciated.

Ebay,How should I handle this? I don't want to be scammed.,"So I purchased a Blackberry playbook 32gb for $33.75 

&amp;#x200B;

the buyer has 4 reviews, 3 of which come from him as a buyer rather than a seller.

&amp;#x200B;

my item was expected to arrive 12/13. A box arrived on 12/13. I opened it up, and it was a Gameboy Color(kiwi), and 3 games(1 Pokemon game, and 2 army men 3d games)

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately wrote the buyer and informed him that I think he sent me the wrong package by mistake, and informed him of what i recieved. He didn't write me back, so on 12/14 I opened up an ""Item not received"" dispute. for the comments for the seller I included the following:

""Hello... I received a package yesterday containing a game boy color and 3 games. Not the playbook that I purchased. I assume you placed the wrong labels on the wrong box. I dont mind sending you the game boy back. Ideally I would like to get the playbook that I purchased. But if you can't send it. I would like a refund so I could purchase another one""

&amp;#x200B;

He responded and wrote me the following:

"" Omg I am so sorry That was a return of mine. If you send it back I can send you the tablet. Sorry""

&amp;#x200B;

\-------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My thought process is this:  

I can understand placing the wrong label on the wrong box. it's happened to me a few times. but if he misplaced the labels, why is the tablet still in his possession? if he thought it was a box he planned to return, why didn't he return it? Also I'm not about to just return the gameboy without being provided a shipping label, or some compensation for the postage. I paid for my item, and the shipping for my item. I shouldn't be required to pay for postage to someone elses item. Also Right now according to tracking a package was delivered to my address.... Granted Ebay is generally good about favoring the buyer but I've always been told you need to protect yourself before leaving yourself open to getting scammed.

How long can I have a case open? What if I send him back his gameboy, a week goes by... he sends me out another box filled with junk.... it takes a week to arrive and by that time ebay closes their case? I get stuck with junk, a closed case?

&amp;#x200B;

Currently as it sits I don't think he is trying to scam me, but I'm not about to leave myself open to it. at the end of the day it was his mistake so i feel if anyone should take any risks, it should be him. Also I feel like I've got enough value in the gameboy that if he doesn't want to offer a refund, or send me my item, i could Potentially sell off what he sent me, and recover just enough money after shipping + ebay fees to get my $33 back.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How should I respond to his message? what advice do you give me? should I just wait for ebay to close the case, and make sure it goes in my favor. that way I get refunded and then can ask him for shipping/postage to resend him his package?

Ebay,Returning Item with damage that was not described,"Basically a seller did not accurately describe the damage of the phone.

When I received the ""item"" it was literally shipped in a bundle of newspapers and that is it. So this damage might have been in transit but the seller seems to think I am scamming her.

The listing pictures were very angled and showed a crack in the top right of the screen. The description mentioned this crack. However the pictures never showed the LCD damage(not cracked glass but since the phone was bent so hard I guess the LCD inside cracked) on the top left. Also the phone was really bent out of shape. Neither of which was mentioned in the listing.

She used ""as is"" and ""no returns"" but her listing says it accepts returns for 30 days so I opened a return. Now she keeps messaging me... She keeps messaging me about it and I just want it to stop. Can I block her and still do the return?

&amp;#x200B;

Responses I got from her....

First I tell her about the damages I found upon opening the ""package"" and she says

&gt;Ok, so what do you want to do?

At this point it seems she knew about the damage all along... I say I could do $40 off and keep the item or just return it but I guess knowing what a partial refund is and replying to her question is a eBay violation....

&gt;The fact that you know what a partial refund and ask for one when a item is sold “as is for parts or repair” is already a eBay violation and will definitely be reported to eBay and then on top of that you wanted $40 back? Yeah right, any how I sent you your money back and e.mailed you the return label link.

In regards to me opening her newspaper bundle and finding damage that was not described...

&gt;You opened it right away because I saw you only got it about an hour ago so I could tell you were looking for any little issues about it.

What else do people do when they receive things in the mail?!? She then proceeds to directly send me the original amount I paid on PayPal as a separate payment as Goods and Services and said to ship to her address. I thought was out of the norm. I refunded her money and told her that I would just make a eBay return case as her listing accepts returns for 30 days apparently.

Ebay,How to win a Ridiculous case with Paypal / Ebay for a return item from scam buyer?,"Like many fellow ebay sellers out there, I am now hit with the unfortunate event from a scam buyer who abused the ebay / Paypal system.

I had a buyer with 0 feedback purchased an expensive coat ( &gt; 500 pounds) from me back in October, where one month after the purchase by mid/end of November she suddenly filed an 'Item Not Described' case against me out of the blue. She claims the lining was damaged. I check all my items VERY VERY carefully before shipping and knew that she was bluffing, but had asked her to send pictures of the 'damaged lining' anyways just so I can investigate.

After constantly badgering her for photos , she finally sent the photos in which shows no damage of the lining at all. Just as I was about to reply her one day later, she closed the case herself. ( Probably she realized that the item is not damaged and she has no way of winning? i don't know.)

So this is just the beginning of my nightmare. So 2 weeks later, the buyer changed her strategy and filed an 'item not described' case on paypal. I provided long documentation of the item and the pictures that the buyer sent to me, which of course paypal took no notice and decided in buyer's favor and ruled that the buyer has to return the item to get a refund. 

So I received an email 2 days later with an update on the case - the buyer has uploaded the tracking number which only shows that the item was dropped off at a shipping facility. Load and Behold - the second the tracking number is updated, the buyer is immediately refunded the full amount with the case closed!! ( without the item even anywhere close to leaving her post office). 

The item was supposed to arrive the past Monday, which never arrived. I waited for a few more days and no sign of return package. I called up Fedex and turns out that the package does not have my name as the recepient, and due to data protection laws, they could not also give me the shipping address of the package given that I am not the recepient. Called up Paypal Multiple times, explained the situation and they just insisted that there us a 'valid' tracking number and kept ruling the case closed in buyer's favor ( without even physically clicking into the link that says that the item was not delivered and is still held at sorting facility). I was also met by 'multiple' threats from paypal customer service reps in 'recovering the refund' while I insisted that it should still be an open case given that there is no sign of the return item.

One Paypal rep was so aggressive ( he mentioned that I was 'lucky' that he didn't put me infinitely on the line. Paypal had also not refunded me the paypal fees for the transaction that they refunded the buyer, where the agent threatened that he would only refund the 'paypal fees' from the refund if I pay the balance now, which combined with his aggressive tone really could make a good case of blackmailing.) I actually broke down crying from his aggressiveness and the stress in dealing with them.

So my question is, what should I do in order to appeal this case to paypal? I know it is against paypal policy already for them to refund the customer immediately on uploading a tracking number ( i was told over the phone that it was done by an agent, which I can imagine was the result of the agent giving in to the constant badgering of the buyer. More signs that the buyer is a scammer.)

Should I also bring this up to ebay as well, since this is an item sold through ebay? What can I do to win this case??

Ebay,INAD - Am I being too picky?,"Just trying to spot check myself if its my own negligence or a seller.  If its mine I'm fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was surfing ebay on my phone which is a nasty and expensive habit at times.  There is a bag that I've had my eye on for years which I decided to pop into search.  I found a preowned that was about 40% off retail and looking in great condition.  No mentioned of anything in the description hat I saw so I bid on it.  When it arrives it was most definitely not in like-new condition which was the impress I had from the picture.  So I went back to the post and realized he used a stock image from the manufacturer as the main pic and subsequent pics which I didn't think to check at the time do show a more ""used"" bag.  I msg'd him and explained about the situation probably 3 or 4 days ago and I've received no response back. 

  
Am I over reacting?  Usually when I put my own items for sale I don't ever use a stock photo unless the item is actually new.",7,5,2018-12-17,EBAY,0.03431444615125656,0.9323525428771973,0.033333051949739456

Ebay,"Two separate buyers: ""Please note the new delivery date and complete checkout."" error","On 12/2 I had a buyer buy an item of mine, paying the optional extra $8 for priority shipping, then messaged me this:

&gt;I just purchased this item, but I had to use the USPS Priority shipping option. Every time I tried to purchase the item using the Free Shipping (USPS First Class) option, the eBay website would generate an error message stating **""Please note the new delivery date and complete checkout.""** It would not allow me to complete the purchase until I selected the $8 shipping option.

&gt;If possible, I would prefer to use the free shipping option, especially seeing as how the item delivery estimate was nearly identical. Please let me know if this is an option.

Strange, right?

Then last week, 12/10, I put up a ""reserved"" listing for someone who had me locate an item for them. He wanted it shipped as priority so I made that the only shipping option.

He too had the ""Please note the new delivery date and complete checkout."" error. I changed listing to free media mail, then it let him buy.

Has anyone else's buyers mentioned this to you lately? That's 2/6 sales I've made this month that have been affected where a buyer could not complete checkout. I wonder if it's affecting my sales, since most of what I sell, a few others are also sold from others, so if it's not working for me someone could just buy it from the competitor for an extra dollar.

I inquired to eBay and they suggested I have the buyers reach out to them, aka a useless dead end...

Seems like they're not the only ones, either.

Ebay,Slow shipping...worried about negative feedback,"Hello!

I am a very casual eBay seller (1-2 times a year, usually offloading used electronics when I buy myself upgrades). I sold a laptop that had a broken screen - very clearly stated in the listing and etc. Someone bought it and I shipped 2 hours after they paid during the same day (which was on Friday, Dec. 14). I printed my shipping label from eBay for USPS 2 Day Priority.

It is now Wednesday, 12/19 and the package is still ""in transit"" per tracking. It didn't even appear to move anywhere until Monday, 12/17. On Monday night, the buyer was messaging me wanting to know why it wasn't there yet. I sent him the tracking number so that he can keep himself updated. I also said that it is the busiest week of the year for USPS so outside of mailing the item 2 hours after payment, there is literally nothing I can do to get it there faster. I'm hoping this wasn't supposed to be a Christmas gift since it has a broken screen but you never know. Also- the tracking info is horribly vague. All it says is ""in transit"" and it does not say if it is even in a location that is halfway there or something!

Other than being slammed with Christmas mail, is there any reason why this could be moving so slowly? I am in Cleveland, OH and the buyer is in Brooklyn, NY. To my knowledge there have been no major snowstorms or other weather events that could throw in additional delays in the last few days.

I am really worried about negative feedback in spite of all this. Is there anything else I can do to mitigate the situation? Even worse is, I'm traveling Dec. 20-28th and my plans did **not** include having to check eBay messages and deal with this, if the item doesn't get there or even just takes forever. :/",3,7,2018-12-19,EBAY,0.12090123444795609,0.8538515567779541,0.025247247889637947

Ebay,You(seller) Winning against irate buyer,"I recently had an interaction with a buyer went something like this

&amp;#x200B;

Return request started( I offer 30 day returns no problem there )

Couple days later buyer messages asking nicely for address, I respond that the best way to do a return is through ebay, They then demanded I supply the address because they could not do so. I gave them the address hoping that would be the end of it  


After a couple days(day 6 after return request started) they finally got the item out to me and paid 11$ and the item cost just over 11$, They contacted ebay and ebay told him to contact me about shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

I tell them that is unusual pricing that is why its best to use ebay label but send me receipt images so I can see how I can help.

&amp;#x200B;

This point they had left me positive(yes positive by mistake) feedback, but with negative comments about size and returns

&amp;#x200B;

They send me receipts and said they will change my feedback if I help them out and sorry for being a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

I look at the receipts and message them back, ""typically this item is 3$ to ship via USPS, Ups is not good for small items shipping, I can help you out and I am willing to pay about half of the shipping plus original cost of the item once item returns. I also mention that the size is stated as medium large which basically means between those sizes and the item itself doesn't have an actual size.

### 1. Thanks. 2. I explained the situation regarding my inability to produce a printed shipping label. At no time until now did u mention this detailed and necessary process. 3. Your listening on eBay specifically states it's medium large (see attachment) there is absolutely no mention of this being an adjustable garment in any manner nor is it such.4. Your feedback on eBay will remain.

&amp;#x200B;

Immediately after I message him

""Now you know, Happy Holidays""

Immediately after He message me

This is't over smart ass

(Sends me a google image that says ""TIPp: Sellers is responsible for your return shipping, if they do not provide a label or way to print a label they must cover the cost of shipping if proof of shipping cost is provided"")

&amp;#x200B;

I tell them please do not call me names its not necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

Next day they messaged me again with about 3/4 paragraphs at once, I roughly skimmed it, basically they said I lied to them and that I don't know the policy, they are allowed to do return it that way and I must pay shipping. Ebay will contact me and they are much more polite than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

They have felt like they won and will not only get there original 11$ back but also the ridiculous 11$ they wasted on return shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

I contact ebay because the person has not uploaded tracking information directly to the return request(mistake) or followed ebay return request deadlines(mistake), He used profanity toward me(policy violation) and extorted my feedback(policy violation). 

&amp;#x200B;

They closed the return request, I do not have to refund them anything even if the item returns, and I filed a complaint against the buyer for profanity, and blocked the buyer. The feedback has been removed even tho it was positive it had negative comments.

&amp;#x200B;

Feels good, basically the moral is be as nice and helpful as possible, contact ebay when your not sure, and once the customer has broken any policy, immediately cut ties and contact ebay. Sellers are here to help, but we are not your slaves.

For the record a 11$ item and paying 11$ return shipping is not a big deal, 95% of the time I just give them a refund because that is customer service.

Ebay,Should I leave negative feedback if seller cancels order after payment.,"Hello everyone. This is my first time posting here. Looking for advice. I found a listing for a toy that I wanted to purchase for my daughter for Christmas. The listing wasn't an auction but a ""Buy it Now"" with an option to make an offer. The listing also specified free shipping anywhere in the US (I'm closer to the west coast and he is closer to the east coast.) I made an offer that was a little on the low end. The seller made a counter saying he wouldn't sell for that price because the shipping would cost him to much. I countered again and the seller accepted. I paid right away and went on with my day. The next morning I found that the seller had cancelled the item and left me a message saying the shipping was going to cost too much. 

Should I leave the seller negative feedback? I feel pretty salty about the whole transaction. I feel like he shouldn't offer items for sale with free shipping if he can't afford to ship the item.

Ebay,Did I just get hit by the perfect buyer scam?,"So I sold a very nice, well maintained item on eBay and a buyer is currently scamming me with essentially no way to fix this in sight. They're claiming the item arrived damaged and they're attempting to send me an item back with a different serial number (there is another thing that is different on the item too).

1. Sent the item.
2. Got a claim that item was ""damaged during shipping.""
3. eBay claim is opened with 4 days to answer.
4. Get pictures of the item, and realize it is not the item I sent, but a damaged item instead.
5. Realize I have a picture of the serial number, it does not match the picture he sent.
6. Call eBay and realize they do not have any western phone operators, it's impossible to describe what is happening.
7. Finally get someone who can possibly help and they more or less state that he ""has to send the item back first""
8. Call the police and they say it's a civil matter and won't do anything except ""call to scare him maybe.""
9. Call me back and say the guy is actually amiable, just waiting to ""get his money back"" and send it back.
10. Literally 3 police I've talked to don't seem to even be able to comprehend this is a scam. They keep saying this is civil even though this is certainly some crime, especially given the value (shipment exceeds $1000).

The serial number is affixed by paper since it was repaired at some point, and now I expect them to either rip it off or alter it, but still, is this for real?

Can you really just wild west this and buy and return anything and the police do nothing? Is the only reason people don't do this to get rich morals?

This dude just made a solid, solid, solid $650+ and I'm sure it isn't his first rodeo.

As far as I'm concerned, the photo he sent and the one that I have before sending it should be good enough, and yet this doesn't seem important at all. I am at a loss of words to understand at this point why everyone isn't making $500 a day on this scam.

Surely this must be illegal and I must be dealing with Chief Wiggim himself.

Ebay,Got someone else's package,"Was sent to my house by address.

&amp;#x200B;

Called UPS twice and they said they are sending someone today to come pickup the mis-delivered package and I told them I'd leave it outside if I wasn't home.  But no one has came.  Package is still here and no activity picked up by my doorbell camera.

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure where it's suppose to be sent, most of the places around here are gated communities.  Says it's coming from AT&amp;T but has an ebay sticker on the box.  Was overnighted so it looks expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Did have one of my packages sent to someone else and they called me (my phone number was on the package) and I went to pick it up.  But this package just has all 9's as the phone number.

&amp;#x200B;

Ebay,"eBay invoicing 10% ""Final Value Fee"" for transaction that was cancelled due to fraudulent buyer","I tried selling a set of Beats headphones on eBay.  The offer that I ""accepted"" was for $310, but then the seller started sending me their email and phone number and asking me to complete the transaction outside of eBay (against their rules, obviously), so I reported their account and submitted a cancellation request for the transaction.  The user's account got closed and the transaction no longer shows up anywhere in my seller activity.  (Which seems like a UI bug -- even cancelled transactions ought to show up *somewhere*.)

Except, then I got an invoice for eBay for $31 for the 10% ""Final Value Fee"".  I called up eBay and the lady on the phone said that the cancellation request was still unresolved in the Resolution Center, but the other party had never responded (obviously, since eBay had closed their account), so following her directions, I went to the Resolution Center and closed the case.  Except, after closing the case, the webpage said: ""You will not receive a Final Value Fee credit"":

[https://imgur.com/a/UJlNVY3](https://imgur.com/a/UJlNVY3)

I saw that and said, hey, wait a minute, so the lady on the phone took a few more minutes and processed the Final Value Fee refund manually.  I said, great, but how come that didn't happen automatically if the transaction was cancelled?  She said that in order to get a credit, you have to submit an ""Unpaid item dispute"".  If you merely submit a ""cancellation request"", that cancels the transaction, but it doesn't refund your fee, even if the other party's account was closed and they never submitted payment.

But, hang on.  If you're the seller and you realize someone is a fraudulent buyer, clicking ""cancel transaction"" is the most intuitive option.  Is eBay saying it's my fault (and they weren't going to refund my money unless I'd asked) that out of the multiple *types* of cancellation requests, I clicked ""cancel request"" instead of something else?  And in any case, since legitimate payments go through the eBay system anyway, eBay can *see* that the buyer never sent me any money, so it would seems they'd have no grounds for charging their 10% commission if they know the payment didn't happen.

In my case, of course I noticed what was going on because this was my only sale.  But a high-volume seller might not notice eBay charging them a 10% commission for some of their sales for which they never received payment.

Previously I'd complained that eBay lets bidders submit ""bids"" without adding any type of payment method to their account, and that there were a high number of bugs in the UI, but those complaints would fall more under the category of ""lame"".  However, if eBay is ""invoicing"" peope for their 10% commission on transactions that are cancelled and permanently closed without the seller receiving any payment, that seems legally actionable.  (And at this point, the bugs in the UI *do* become legally relevant, to the extent that they make it hard for users to figure out what's going on.)  Is there any particular reason why a lawyer shouldn't bring a class action suit against them for all the amounts that they ""invoiced"" to sellers, for sales that were cancelled due to fraudulent activity but eBay didn't give the user a Final Value Fee credit?",4,8,2018-12-20,EBAY,0.1774807870388031,0.8002936840057373,0.02222556620836258

Ebay,Can a buyer leave negative feedback after losing an INR case?,"Buyer bought a part for a 2011 Jaguar XF. Item description clearly stated in bold red font that it was damaged and was AS IS for parts or repair, and it sold for 20% of the price that it would have if it were fully functional. Unfortunately, I forgot to change the listing to no returns, but that's largely irrelevant at this point.

Item shipped same day.  Delivered three days later. Six days after shipping, INR case is opened and immediately closed in my favor, since tracking showed delivered. I got a bunch of nasty messages, and that was that. Several days later, I get the expected message ""This is broken, I want to return it"".  Funny, a couple days ago it never showed up in your mailbox.

If they hadn't tried to screw me over on the INR case, I'd be more inclined to help them. As it stands though, I feel no obligation to the buyer. They've tried getting a free part already, and now they've admitted that they didn't read the listing. Most recent message was ""This is a part for a 72 year old woman on fixed income who needs to get to her doctors appointment. You do what you want"". Ok, why is a 72 year old woman on fixed income who's going to go broke over a $75 part driving a newish Jaguar, and why are you trying to guilt trip me?

It genuinely feels like they either deliberately damaged it or they sent back an item that they previously owned because it was damaged and kept the one I sent. Would filing an appeal get me anywhere or am I SOL?

Ebay,"A long and curious Ebay transaction story with possible fraud, maybe? Help?","TLDR: super long detailed story about a possible scam attempt. 

I was selling a ring for about $1100.  A lady in the Bahamas starts asking me for discounts on it back in the summer.  She really wants it for her mom but she really needs it for less money.  I’m willing to sell for $1000, she wants it for $900.  When Ebay offers their one day only coupons I would resend the $1000 offer and tell her to use the coupon for the additional $100 off.  The haggling goes on for months with her continued interest but no commitment to buy.   At some point during this process her messages switch from saying she’s in the Bahamas and now say she’s in Florida. 

So come November, she’s interested again.  Now she needs to get it for her mom in time for Christmas.  We finally agree on a price, I send an offer, she accepts.  She doesn’t pay.  I open an unpaid item case, she finally pays.  The Ebay/PayPal account is associated with one name.  The package is being sent to a different name in Florida, at a business address, and her email address looks like a first initial, second initial, and a third different last name.   I go ahead and ship as everything is verified (though so suspicious) with insurance and signature as the package is worth over $750.  Before I ship it I say to myself “this package is definitely getting lost.”

Now things get weird(Er).  I keep an eye on the tracking.  The postal carrier tries to deliver on a Friday to the business address in Florida during business hours.  It shows a delivery attempt and then “item held at post office at customers request.”   I’ve never seen a business use a hold like this.  I let it slide for a while.  

A week or two goes by and the package is still “on hold.”  My mistake, I decide to poke and prod about it.  I ask the buyer to go pick up her package.  She says she’s in the Bahamas, she can’t get it.   I tell her it’s signature confirmation required, someone has to go pick it up.  She admits it’s going to a business.  I tell her to schedule a redelivery then.  She refuses to do either and just wants me to get the package.  She tells me she’ll just have it sent back to me, I tell her to just try and get it.  I ask her how she was planning on getting a package with signature from another country she’s not in, she assures me she’s just on vacation but doesn’t answer any specifics.  I ask her who all the different names are and if anyone can help, more silence.   Is she the buyer, the receiving name, neither, both?  Nothing. 

So she opens an item not received case and I open an investigation with the usps just in case something did actually go wrong.  The Ebay case gets closed in my favor as it’s her responsibility to pick up the package from to post office.  Then some super frazzled woman calls me from the post office saying the package isn’t exactly where she thought it would be so sure, it’s lost.  I try to ask her about a business using a vacation hold and what could have happened here.  She was calling on like a Saturday at nearly 6pm her time, she did not care, I don’t believe she actually looked for the package, she didn’t want to talk to me, she wanted to go home.  I found out no more information.   I’ve tried calling that post office again since but they just the line ring and ring. 

So I’m free to open an insurance claim now.  It’s pending.  However, the woman hasn’t contacted me since the Ebay case has closed.  She has other ways to go about getting the money back but I don’t necessarily want to contact her first again.   I don’t want to tell her how to win the money back from me before I even get the item or insurance payment back. I absolutely can’t figure out what happened here.  I don’t know what to do if the USPS pays me out.   I still feel like if I refund her she’s going to go the Post office and pick up the package.  This whole transaction has felt like a fraud that I couldn’t quite figure out since her first messages and location changes. 

What do you think happened here?  What are my obligations?  What would you do?  What was her scam if there was any?  Did she have a way of making sure that package wouldn’t be delivered?  Does she have it?   Is it still going to turn up?  What do you guys think?  

For clarity:  the address didn’t look like a freight forwarder but I guess it could have been.  The address possibly looks like a travel agency for a resorts company.",16,4,2018-12-23,EBAY,0.05022834986448288,0.9181391596794128,0.03163251653313637

Ebay,eBay needs to give Sellers more power,"Am I missing something?  I’ve been selling for years and it drives me nuts what some buyers try to pull or scam.  Why can’t sellers leave negative reviews?  

For example I sold this beautiful Encased football card, mint condition and I go over and beyond with packaging.  The buyer receives the item and messages me that there is a scratch on the case and would like $20 credited (items sold for around $100 and considered good deal). I told him to send me pictures and he never did.  I called him out as politely as one can per eBay messages.  He filed a return thinking I’d give into the $20 credit (at this point I’m more than happy to take item back because I can sell it for more which I’m sure buyer knows). I let the return ride and eBay sends him label, he never returned and case was closed.  Now, I’m sure he’s doing this to others and why can’t I put or rate my transaction with this buyer (you only can leave positive feedback which is a joke).  

Am I missing something where seller can leave negative feedback?  You think eBay would protect its sellers more considering the amount of money they make off us (sellers).

She was supposed to send the item back by Dec 21, but after going back and forth with the buyer, asking questions, asking for her to post pictures, etc, she went radio silent and stopped replying on Dec 18.

You should wait until you get the item back before you refund the buyer. Please ensure that you issue the refund within 2 business days of the item being delivered. If the buyer doesn't send the item back by Dec 21 we may close this return.

Ebay,"Bought ebay item as NEW and was clearly Open-box New, of unsure details. Unsure how to handle.","I recently purchased a Dyson stick vacuum on ebay, specifically filtering my listings for ""New"", and the item has clearly been opened already on arrival.  The Dyson box arrived w/o a shipping box, it was shipped as the Dyson box itself with a label stuck right on it, a little dinged from shipping but otherwise okay.  Maybe it was already dinged before shipping.  The edges were taped up with clear shipping tape, and the original small plastic seals were already broken.  It had been opened previously.  Now shipped to me like this.  My wife opened it already to inspect the contents, which were inside some plastic, but nothing was sealed/resealed. It was kind of chaoticly assorted inside It could have  been easily reboxed.  It did not get the sense that it was simply opened and closed.   We haven't used it yet.

The item was listed as ""New"", not ""New (other)"" The Ebay item did not specifically show picture of exact item, just stock photos of the item.  Listing was essentially: ""Dyson Absolute Brand new in box"" . Which I realize now could be a very vague way of saying, ""New (other)"", ""Item has been previously opened"", perhaps with details of why.  Maybe it was a store display model?  Maybe someone bought it, opened it, and changed their mind right away?  Maybe it was used for a month?  I really can't say.  The contents of the vacuum

The purchase price was the lowest of the New items, but was comparable to others.  Maybe $5 cheaper.  Bed Bath Beyond with 20% coupon is the same price, for a real new item.  I went with ebay because I had a small credit to use.

So I'm a little perturbed over this, but not sure best way to proceed. This was meant to be a holiday gift and xmas already arrived.  I haven't contacted the seller yet, but am not even sure how this is usually handled.  Force the seller to take it back, even thought it is listed as ""no returns""?  File a Paypal claim?  Request a discount?  It would cost about $15-$20 to ship likely, who pays that?   Part of me really wants to keep it and move on (because its easiest), but part of me feels cheated, and distrusting of the items quality.

Ebay,Please help me avoid being scammed for my item and $400,"Edit/repost to remove swearing (-_-) / 

This is a long story thank you in advance for reading.

Background on my seller profile, 5 year seller with 100% positive feedback. Very high dollar electronics / clothes sold in the past with positive feedback. Hundreds of items bought.

Heres the story, bought a used ipad pro 10.5 2017 on ebay for $500 about 6 months ago. Great deal vs buying retail and decided to get the new 2018 ipad pro through att installment plan and sell the old one. Listed the 10.5 2017 for buy it now $430. Case and screen protector on it the entire time of my ownership. Not even a hairline scratch anywhere on it. Item condition scammer in california pays nearly instantly after the listing was posted and brought the items “pre-owned” or used condition into question and threatened a refund case as i was about to ship. Canceled the order and sent the guy a full refund(Burned for 35-40$ ebay invoice that month).

2-3 months later after studying anti-scammer videos on youtube, i re-list the ipad for $399. Lots of views and watchers and it sells within the same afternoon. I’m praying that there wont be any more scammers on my items and i package the ipad up with super overkill bubble wrap and cushioning and take pictures of everything going in the parcel before sealing/shipping.I hand the Fedex store clerk my iphone so there wont be address errors. I messed up by glancing too carelessly at the “are you sure this is right” address summary on the credit card machine at checkout. I add the tracking number to ebay, transfer the money to my bank to pay bills and forget about it.

5-7 days later the ipad is back on my front porch when i get home from work (busiest street in town by 3 bus stops and a shopping plaza, thanks Fedex) soaked and soggy from the rain. If i didn’t have 4 years of shipping job experience i wouldn’t have double plastic bagged and taped the iPad before sealing , thankfully i did. There was a return to sender label on the box and i notice that the Fedex clerk typod’ the guys street address by one number, causing it to bounce back to me. 

I apologize to the buyer for the delays, inspect and repackage the item in a new box, pay for shipping again on my own dime, diligently checking the address and update the tracking number. About 7 days later the buyer opens a case for item not received when the tracking showed it was delivered 2 days earlier. They lose the case and receive no refund as tracking showed delivery. Now its about 5 days later and the scammer magically found the box and they open a return /refund request for “item not in listing condition”. No pictures of any damage or what items are missing so far.

I feel like i should have nothing to fear, but i’ll be damned if some scammer keeps my iPad and my money by exploiting some grey area loophole in ebay’s terms of service. They don’t know I have pictures of every item included in the package (iPad itself, installed screen protector, flip cover case, extra screen protector and charger with cord) before i padded it and sealed the box. Im here to ask from ebay veterans what the best course of action is....

The photo of the iPad itself shows the foam bag it’s in and bubble wrap wrapped around it;and other photos show the individual other items clearly. What is to stop this person from breaking it in half on the corner of a coffee table , sending pictures of the open box with stuff missing etc? I need the ebay vets opinion.

Ebay,Do you have to pay ebay fees when it’s cash on collection?,"About a year ago, I sold a phone cash on collection. Buyer paid me cash upon picking it up. About 2 days later, I received a message from eBay saying seller fees weren’t paid? 

The buyer and myself were messaging back and fourth (he didn’t actually select cash on collection on the listing), so I gave him an address 2mins away from me because I didn’t think he was serious as he was coming from a place about a 2 hour drive from me for a £150 phone.

Turns out he did, and I went to meet him and he paid cash and all went good (he did negotiate the price to £135 but went good), ended the listing after that was done.

My 1st question is, how did ebay know that the sale went through if it was just between messages? 

2nd question: if buyer selects the “pickup” option and if you have the listing as “Buy it Now” would it pay through PayPal or would they just win the listing if they select the pickup option?

Many of the questions indicated that they are aware that there are dissatisfied sellers. This is an opportunity to express yourself.

Something needs to change, and this is a good opportunity to express your desire to make that happen. I doubt this survey will accomplish much in the short-term, but if enough people express their dissatisfaction, it might be enough to get the ball rolling later on down the line.

I want to fight this. I don't see an issue to escalate.
The case says please respond by dec 31 or we may approve it for you.

Is there anyway I can at least get out of paying for the return postage.

I know it doesn't mean much, but I also don't accept returns on this item.  



EDIT:
Ebay is now open for calls, so i called them.  
They gave me some interesting information.  
Apparently the buyer has already lost their Ebay money back guarantee status.  
Interestingly I cannot tell, looking at their account it looks normal (over a year old, 26  positive feedback 100%)  
The ebay rep sounded american.  
He told me that I can just ignore the return, even to archive it.  
He said it will not be possible for either me or the buyer to escalate the claim.  
He also checked to see if the payment was held, he said it was not.
He said that ebay is going against buyer like this more recently (gods, i hope so!)
Call waiting was about 20 min, +5 min talking to the rep.

His information did make me happy, but given my experiences with ebay i am a little skeptical.  
I'm concerned that the buyer merely is not able to escalate the issue yet, and that the rep could not see that.

Ebay,"Buyer saying giant backpack is missing from package, box has small external damage.","I'm an infrequent eBay seller. I sold an Osprey Porter 46 backpack a few weeks ago. I shipped the backpack on December 13th enclosed in the official osprey plastic bag and placed it in the original shipping box. 

The box arrived at their post office on December 16th with a notice for them to pick it up. They finally picked it up today (December 26th) and are claiming that the box is damaged and the backpack is not inside. 

I asked them to send a picture of the damage. The picture shows a rip in the box, but nothing big enough for the backpack to have fallen out. I can see a bit of the osprey bag inside the box, but the picture is too dark to see it clearly. 

I noticed the tape is completely ripped off the top of the box so I asked about it. They said they had already opened it and the only thing that was in it was the osprey bag. 

I'm sensing a scam here. I worry that eBay will side with the buyer because there is external damage to the box. They did not receive anything from the post office noting the damage. It doesn't make sense why only the bag would be in the box since the backpack was in the bag and the bag's flap was taped shut.

What are my options? Do I call the post office, eBay, both? I did not purchase insurance (I sold the bag for $110, it cost $32 to ship USPS ground, insurance in addition to that would have made the sale not worth it). 

Edit: I decided to get ahead of it and called eBay. They closed the case siding with me since the buyer did receive the package. They told me to contact USPS and there should be notice of an empty box if that was the case upon arrival. eBay did say the buyer can appeal the decision and a refund could be granted as a courtesy. This worries me since there is nothing I can do from here unless USPS can back me up. If this is a scammer, I don't see the benefit of them working hard to push this through by requesting an appeal, I feel like they are just trying to scare me into a refund. Meanwhile, I'm spending my night on hold forever with the post office like a chump to make sure I have a solid case against them.

Edit2: This buyer is a persistent piece of work. Per the helpful comments here, I told them to contact the post office and they're still wanting a refund because ""the post office can't give me my money back"". I told them they can file a theft claim with the post office. As of now, they're refusing and claiming it's my responsibility to put insurance on the package and because I didn't, I should issue a refund. 

Edit3: eBay call 2 was a success. They said that the buyer must file a police report since they're reporting a missing package (doubtful they will actually do this). If eBay accepts the report, they will issue a refund, not me. That's really all I care about at this point. They said just let it go and the buyer will contact them when the dispute timer runs out. They have documentation of my phone call, so they have my side before the buyer can get their bs story in.",21,6,2018-12-26,EBAY,0.0912371277809143,0.8768712282180786,0.031891606748104095

Ebay,Seller deducting $240 from return because package was open...,"Hi all,

Recently I purchased and received a $1200 new laptop from a reputable seller but the item was slightly off. They sent me a slightly lower spec model when I paid for the higher spec model, and so I asked to return the item for my money back. They accepted my return and gave me a shipping label, and I packaged the laptop back up exactly how I received it. The laptop was probably out of its original packaging for maybe 5 hours. They received my return and partially refunded me only $960. They deducted $240 and their reasoning was because the “package was opened”. Isn’t that a bit ridiculous? Obviously the package would be open, otherwise I wouldn’t know that you sent me the wrong damn model! Anyway I asked eBay to step in saying I’d like a full refund. Will I have a chance of winning? They’re a very large and reputable seller so I’m afraid I won’t. 

Thanks

Ebay,"Advertised priority, but sent media","So I bought a print for a gift to my wife on 12/17. Listing shows it would be sent Priority Mail for $8.50. I get a tracking and next day I pull it up and shows an estimated delivery of 12/24, and that it’s media mail.

Of course it’s not here yet. Some how it went from Calif to Florida instead of my state (which is on west coast). I had msgd him asking why it was sent media instead of priority. He responds that it was sent priority, it’s a postal mistake and that it’s my fault it’s in Florida. Wtf?! I have printed proof from USPS clerk at post office, he dismisses it.

Anyways, he refuses to refund me any postage or show proof of the shipping method, other than a screen shot of the shipping info page from the listing. USPS now says item is lost, damaged label. Since it was sent media, it’s not insured. He said he doesn’t buy insurance unless requested and denies priority has insurance automatically.

I finally opened a case, to which he insulted me, and I then left neg feedback. To which he says “I'm not sure why you left that negative feedback once I drop an item at the post office it's literally out of my control I was about to refund you for the whole item and let you keep it as soon as it showed up but since you couldn't be patient with the USPS and you decided you needed to leave negative feedback whatever that accomplished is you not get any money back” That’s verbatim.

There is much more that made me laugh, but this seller somehow has over 5000 feedback and acts like this.

Am I in the right that I’ve taken these steps?

**update**

Item arrived today, damaged. It shows it was sent media mail. I responded to the case with the info and damaged packaging. It was not opened as I’m waiting for my wife to get home and decide if she wants to refuse delivery and return it.

Ebay,"Can I troll a seller for putting up ""fake"" prices?","Friends,

&amp;#x200B;

I find a lot of sellers on eBay and Amazon like to put up many options at different price points on one product listing. Lower priced options make buyers click through to the item to see if the low price includes what they want. It doesn't - sometimes the option is a quarter of the quantity advertised in the title, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

In this case I'm buying a cable on eBay. The cable comes up as a price range $x - $3x dollars, a pretty wide range, and comes in a hundred options that all price out to $3x once you select everything. (And it's quite deceptive because if \*any\* option is unselected, the item's page shows not a range but simply the overall minimum price, $x, even though you can't get any of the options you already selected at $x.) Finally I went through and found the one options combo that truly is sold at $x, quite buried, and I think it will work fine for me!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the fun part: The low priced option has only 1 quantity remaining. I bought it, and the listing changed to a flat price of $3x. After some time the seller noticed and increased the available quantity back to 1, setting their fake price game up again. Now, I wouldn't mind having a few spare cables. Anything wrong if every couple days I knock out the misleading price by buying their one cheap cable?",29,23,2018-12-29,EBAY,0.05702528730034828,0.9009035229682922,0.04207127168774605

Ebay,Not sure what to do about the item I just purchased. Please help!,"Hey all,

I apologize that this post is so long. I've been on eBay for a few years now and have been lucky enough to have mostly positive transactions, so I've never been in a situation like this - any and all help would really be appreciated!

I recently purchased a Tria 4x laser hair removal device in the hopes of replacing my old one.

The device was listed as being new with an open box. I was able to buy it at a very discounted price of $230 (the Tria is regularly $449). The seller does not accept returns.

I received the device in the mail the other day and as soon as I opened it, I could tell that something was off. It already has scratch marks and other small signs of wear and tear, and the label covering the base is dirty. I was kind of annoyed, but since I'd gotten such a discount, I figured I could live with it if the device was otherwise unused.

So I went to Tria's website to activate my device (there are a few small steps you have to take to ""unlock"" the Tria before you can use it). I was having trouble with the activation, even though I was entering the information correctly. I then realized that the device had already been activated.

I was pretty upset at this point (all signs seemed to point to the Tria having been used), but I managed to keep my cool when I messaged the seller to ask.

He explained that he hadn't known much about the device and had assumed he needed to activate it in order to make sure it worked. He had also done two test zaps (one on the lowest setting and one on the highest) to confirm that it worked.

That made sense, but it didn't explain the scratches. I asked him about those as well. He said that the place he got it from guarantees that all of its items are unused (unless otherwise noted) and are either shelf pulls or unused displays. He also offered to send a little money back to ease my mind (though he didn't specify how much).

Am I being petty? Should I just accept the partial refund? Should I request a full refund? Assuming the seller is telling the truth, the device is still technically new (I guess?) - but if it had been accurately described in the listing, I definitely wouldn't have bought it.

\*mine was a Mother needed the item asap so she contacted me BEFORE purchasing and negotiated a price for next day delivery which I was more than happy to do, posted it , I got amazing feedback and she messaged me saying thank you and she passed on my name to her friends low and behold that weekend I got similar requests from different ppl saying their friend had passed on my ebay name. They all left good feedback. At the time I was pretty new so this boosted my self confidence, feedback stats and profits big time!",23,16,2018-12-30,EBAY,0.07328501343727112,0.8662206530570984,0.060494326055049896

Ebay,question about bidding,"1. if i bid 30$ on an item (max bid), can someone just bid like 29.50$ and make me have to pay 30$ or will he have to bid higher than me in the maximum bid to be able to win the product?
2. if i bid 100$ on a 10$ item and i win it by the end, will i have to pay my maximum bid or will i have to pay just 0.50 cents above the last highest bid?

Ebay,"When people ask, ""is this a scam?"" eBay rant","Whenever I see that title on a post, I always say in my head, ""yes"".  9.5 times out of 10, I'm right and it is a scam when I open and read the post.  Why can't buyers use some sense?  Why can't things like this be made into a sticky?  I've messaged mods before asking to use some of these as examples an warnings so that 40 people/day stop asking and to get the word out.  It's so problematic yet, \*crickets\*.

You are not getting a Nintendo switch, PS4, the latest XBOX, an iPad, or iPhone brand new for $65, $80, $100, or $120.

You are not getting a gaming chair from China for $10 and free shipping.

Not every 0 feedback buyer on a guest account is a scammer.

Stop feeding the scammers, and think before you buy.  To the geniuses saying, ""well, I buy it because I may just end up getting it one day because it just might be legit"", you're even worse because you're aware of the situation and justifying 2 different sets of bad behavior.  Have fun getting your buying privileges revoked because you open too many cases.",69,55,2018-12-31,EBAY,0.040440142154693604,0.9212880730628967,0.038271740078926086
