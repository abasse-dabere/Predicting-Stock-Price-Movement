Ebay,Seller with Multiple Accounts?,"I was wondering if any advantage to being a eBay seller with multiple accounts.

Ebay,How to deal with unwarranted Negative feedback?,"Ok, so here's the deal:  I won an authentic NBA jersey at a benefit, had no use for it and sold it on Ebay.  I listed the size on the tags had 4 pictures of the thing as well as a picture of the size tag.  Auction ended , and I shipped the jersey out.  Three weeks later I get neg. feedback stating that the jersey is too small.  his ""proof"" is he has another jersey the same size and it doesn't fit the same.


As far as i can tell that's not my fault. I mean if I bought something on ebay that was ""my size"" and it didn't fit I don't think I would blame the seller.  I listed as accurately as possible and shipped quickly. 

I'm fairly new to selling and want to know how to combat this.

Ebay,"Sent a touchpad, never got paid. What to do?","Hi everyone. I've never been in this situation before so I don't know what to do. I sold a touchpad on ebay on Halloween. The buyer made a payment about four days later. I ended up sending the touchpad something like five days after the auction. However, the buyer retracted his payment via ebay buyer protection two weeks later. He claimed he never received the touchpad. I didn't get tracking info or insurance. Next time I will, but for the purpose of this story, I didn't.

Anyway, I ask him his phone number so I can call him, and he tells me he doesn't speak english. He can't write a coherent email either. So, there is no hope for communication. Ebay can't help and neither can paypal. All I want to do is call him to make sure he didn't steal my touchpad.

What should I do? Other than, make a mental note to get insurance and tracking info on my next transaction. Is there any way I can get his phone number he registered with on paypal or ebay? All I really want is peace of mind on this transaction and I don't really think it's right or businesslike for him to say, ""sorry, i don't speak english, leave me alone.""",14,6,2012-01-06,EBAY,0.055018141865730286,0.9200636148452759,0.024918321520090103
Ebay,Any other buyers ever had a problem with old shipping addresses intermittently reappearing?,"My wife is having an ongoing dispute with Paypal / eBay where they are saying that she is selecting old addresses for the shipping address of her purchases. We ""caught it in the act"" this morning on a new purchase where it randomly selected her father's address (definitely not her default address) but both eBay and Paypal are saying that it is not a problem with her selection.

So my questions are - has anyone else had this issue before with Paypal / eBay? And, if so, has either of these fine organisations ever accepted responsibility?

Ebay,"Seller didn't respond to two emails over 4 days, found better offer.","So recently I bid on a iPhone 3GS and won it for $120.  After bidding I noticed that it's location is from ""Fast Shipping USA, United Sates"" that seemed odd to me plus the fact that the seller didn't use his own photograph but a default one from google.

Here's the series of events and I can go into detail if requested.  I am being as unbiased as possible.

* 1/7/12 - She contacts me: ""I received the dolls today and as I looked at them I noticed that the USA one is missing most of the paint on its nose.The Japan one has a signs of wear on the face.The Englad one has a light streak on the face and I have three other ones that look like they were not just open but signs of wear. I am not happy on the purchase I made because these items are not as described.""    
* 1/7/12 - I respond: ""I am incredibly sorry to hear that.  I assure you I opened each figure, took the photo and then placed them back in the boxes.  I can give you the $8 to ship them back to me and when I receive them I can give you a refund.""    
* 1/7/12 - Her: ""I would like to either get a parcial refund and the USA figure exchanged or possibly if you have those figures in stock exchanged with shipping included. Thank you for understanding!""    
* 1/7/12 - Me: ""Sure.  I do not have another USA figure, but I can forward you the $4 for shipping to return the doll and when it arrives send you the additional $2.50.""    
* 1/8/12 - Her: ""f you can provide me with $ to ship them back. At the end I want my $24.99+$8.00 It would not be fair for me to lose on anything because they were not as described!""    
* 1/8/12 - Me: ""So you no longer want a partial refund?  You want to ship all of the figures back?  I'm sending you the $8 to ship them back now.""    
* 1/8/12 - I Paypal her $8 to ship the figures back.    
* 1/8/12 - A couple hours after I send her the shipping money, she opens a ""case"" on ebay and paypal takes my money.  Here's the additional info she added: """"I received the items. It stated it comes with boxes, the boxes are all destroyed as well as several figures with signs of use. This items were not as described very disatisfied contacted seller and did not come to an agreement.""    
* 1/14/12 - I've waited almost a week and the figures do not arrive.  I send the buyer a message inquiring about when she shipped the figures back: ""When did you ship the figures?  Do you know when I can expect to receive them?  Thanks,""    
* 1/15/12 - Ebay sends a message saying: ""The buyer has asked eBay Customer Support to review this case and make a final decision.""    
* 1/15/12 - A couple hours later Ebay sends me a message saying ""eBay opened a case because of an issue with an item purchased from you. We reviewed the case and have decided to issue the buyer a full refund of $32.99. The refund includes the purchase price plus original shipping. The hold on this PayPal transaction has been removed.""    
* 1/15/12 - ""can you please tell me when i can expect the figures back? you have been fully refunded plus the money to ship them back. you have not been responding to my messages which makes me think the worst.""

Ebay,Some buyers amaze me,"So here's my story.

A month ago I decided to sell an xbox on ebay. Someone purchased it on the December 18th and received it on the 22nd. Weeks go by and yesterday I receive a message from the buyer saying that they have been using the xbox for the past 3 weeks and that it broke yesterday so they want a full refund. I tell them that the item arrived in working condition and that it is not my responsibility that they broke it. The buyer replies saying that I KNEW that it would break in three weeks time and that is why I decided to sell it. I call them out on how ridiculous that is so they try saying that the xbox that they received was not as described because they received a refurbished one and not a used one like the listing stated (i sent them my used xbox, not a refurbished one) because the serial on the back of the xbox and the one found in settings do not match. I call them out on how this is a blatant lie. They admit to lying and once again insist that I give them a refund because it is my fault that the xbox broke and that these things usually come with a 30 days warranty. I tell them that no where in my listing did I offer a warranty and that the listing stated no returns unless if the product arrived damaged, which in this case did not happen. They reply once again saying that the customer is always right and that it is my fault the xbox broke and that if I did not grant a refund they would leave me negative feedback. I once again decline stating that it is not my responsibility since it broke from their use. 

A few hours pass by and I receive a message saying that it is the kid's mother speaking. She goes on to say that she knows that it is not my fault that the xbox broke but she feels like I should do something to make this right and once again asks for a refund and if I don't she will report me to ebay. At this point I check my feedback and she has left me negative feedback saying: ""This clown sold me a an Xbox that broke after weeks of use. Won't give refund!""

At this point I decide to contact Ebay Customer Support to explain the situation. The representative goes through the messages that were exchanged between myself and the buyer. After a few minutes of being on hold the representative tells me that I am in no way responsible for the item breaking and that I do not have to give the buyer a refund. She also removes the negative feedback saying that the buyer was guilty of feedback extortion and that their ebay account would be banned. I go to sleep last night thinking everything was settled.

I wake up this morning to an email from PayPal notifying me that the buyer has opened a dispute and has escalated it. In the claim the buyer states: that they received an xbox with internal damage, that I knew about it and that I refuse to give them a refund. 

Paypal gives me a chance to give my side of the story. Now my paypal has a negative balance because of this and I have to wait for PayPal to resolve the case.


**TL;DR: I sell an Xbox on ebay. A month later buyer contacts me saying that they broke the xbox and that they want a refund. They claim that I knew all along that it would break after around a month of use. Leave me negative feedback. I contact ebay customer support and am told that I am not responsible for giving the buyer a refund since it broke in their hands, they also remove the negative feedback because of feedback extortion. i wake up today to find that the buyer has opened and escalated a dispute on PayPal claiming that the Xbox arrived already damaged. Give my side of the story and now I wait for PayPal to make a decision on the case.**",0,3,2012-01-18,EBAY,0.14313949644565582,0.8310258984565735,0.02583465538918972

Ebay,"eBay, PayPal, and credit card charge backs. Worst headache ever.","I sold my Alienware m11x laptop on eBay on 11/20/11 and it was paid for on 11/22/11. Nearly two months later I get two emails saying the laptop has a bad hard drive and he will be contacting PayPal.

The hard drive is NOT bad. I wiped it right before sending as a security measure. The OS disc from Dell was included, however, and this person can install Windows 7 from it.

My listing never said ""No OS installed"" but it didn't say ""OS installed and ready to go!"" either. I always wipe the HD before selling computers and I always wipe them when purchasing before installing an OS. Fact is, the laptop is in like new condition as stated. I sent everything I listed, and the OS is there for them to install at anytime. I also listed that this is a Netbook, which has NO DVD/CD drive.

I have offered to help him and offered to pay shipping and I will install for him. Unfortunately, he speaks broken English and I think that is a barrier holding us back.

It's past the 45 day PayPal claim period so he can't file a claim with them but he can file a charge back with whatever credit card he used. In my conversation with PayPal, they made it seem like it was possible for him to get a refund AND keep the laptop(in worst case scenario). Wtf? 

Also, the guy had it for nearly 2 months before saying anything. In that 2 months the value of the laptop has gone down and if I have to resell after all this nonsense I would loose money. It's also been in a strangers hands and it will not be in the same, near perfect condition I sent it in.

I called my credit card provider, Capital One, and they reassured me a little. While I don't know if this guy paid with Capital One, it gave me an idea of the policies for these companies. They said they don't just give a refund for everything and in listening to my case said that PayPal(with ""evidence"", ie emails) would be able to make a strong case on my behalf. 

The Capital One guy made PayPal seem like a ""brickwall"" when it came to defending merchant charge backs but I've heard differently. Hell, PayPal themselves didn't even speak that highly of themselves. Either way, the conversation with this guy from Capital One is the only thing keeping me somewhat calm.

Anyone have any advice or gone through something similar? This is driving me crazy.",18,5,2012-01-19,EBAY,0.047164928168058395,0.9176438450813293,0.035191234201192856

Ebay,"I don't know what to do, buyer and I both made mistakes, but now I am out $100+ in potential profit, should I take action?","So I was selling two Disney tickets that expire 1/19 (aka yesterday) So back in December I sold them on eBay, I have done this a few times and every time it has gone smoothly, always with an auction. So here is what happened


12/24 - sold 2 tickets for $100 buy-it-now, before any bids, minutes after I listed it. I put in the description that you would have to call Disney to find the blackout dates, because I didn't want to be caught in a storm of misinformation that ends with the buyer being told at the Disney gates that their tickets are black outed, because as a middleman Disney told me the wrong thing. Buyer tells me they cannot find out information on them. Send email to Disney
12/26 after unreturned emails from Disney I call, they tell me no blackout dates. I tell buyer and ask if I can ship them.
12/28 buyer says ship them, and that they need them on 12/31 because that is when they leave.
12/28 sent them (I've never had a package take more than 3 days to get anywhere)
12/31 buyer leaves, says their family will mail them back and want a refund. I agree, After we seem to agree Buyer takes out case on me (with every option, they said the product was not as described, that it was unusable...) , freezes assets, 
1/3 tickets arrive told that they are being sent back
1/4 ebay reviews case, tells us to work it out first.
1/19 Undelivered overnight note arrived from USPS, meaning that they had to have been sent at earliest 1/17 (two weeks after they arrived to them.)
1/20 buyer told me he overnighted them and wanted a refund NOW.


TLDR!

So here is what happened on the fault side


Me: didn't send it with a guarantee to be there on time and arrived late
Buyer: held onto them for more than 2 weeks causing me not to have time to resell them.

Ebay,MC019 eBay Listing Removed: Trademark Breach,"Hello,

I sell jewellery on ebay. One of the fads recently has been ""shamballa bracelets"" I dont know if you know about them but if you dont please google, you will probably recognise them.

Fwiw I sell various designs of this metal, onyx , rhinestone etc and it's sort of generally agreed ""shamballa bracelet"" is the correct term to use. I've been selling them for 4-5 months as have other people and if you look on ebay you will find thousands of listings. I am actually currently listing about 10 of these myself. For the sake of the arguement we will say I have broken the trademark.

Here is the surprise, just now I've had 1 of my listings pulled because of this MC019 and it doesn't make any sense as I have many others listed as does everyone else which obviously all break the trademark if this one does. In fact fwiw lots of people use ""tresor paris"" in their listings when I do not which is another trademark infringement I would imagine.

If you look on this link http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=m570.l2736&amp;_nkw=metal+shamballa
This is the exact bracelet I had removed (metal) and I have others still listed. 

I would have thought it was another member reporting me because they didn't like the competition but I received this email message. So it clearly is not right?



Questions about the specific violation should be addressed to Shamballa Jewels ApS 

Their attorney or whoever is involved is a company named ""nixonpeadbody"" who I googled and seem very legitimate.

Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR
Item is removed yet I have 10~ other very very similar listings
Thousands of similar listings remain from Chinese sellers, UK sellers, USA sellers etc
WHY!?!?


QuickEdit : I can contact the company that did this to me but at this current time im not going to do so as I think it might adversely affect my other listings and make me more of a victim. 

Edit 2: If any USA redditors could comment on this I would appreciate it as I think this was my only listing which shipped this product to USA &amp; Canada where as my other products I hadn't started doing this yet.  From my basic research it seems nobody lists this as ""shamballa bracelet"" in the USA where as rest of the world its completely standard?",4,2,2012-01-25,EBAY,0.06443286687135696,0.9125182628631592,0.0230488833039999

Ebay,Has any seller had ebay force you to accept a bogus return from a buyer?,"I'll try to make this as easy as possible.

-Sold a genuine prada purse on ebay with certificate of authenticity.

-Buyer claims its fake,requests return

-I say its real, tell him to look at certificate of authenticity.

-Buyer escalates case

-Ebay finds in his favor after only 2 hours.  



So ebay is forcing me to accept a return for a genuine item.  Ebay didn't even spend any time researching my claims that the COA was real.  Since there is no money in my paypal account, my balance immediately turned negative after their ""ruling.""

Can I refuse to accept this return?  I mean how can ebay MAKE me give the money back?  There's no money in my paypal account.  They certainly cannot take money from my bank account without my permission (can they?)

What happens if the purse is not in the same condition as when I sent it?  Like what if its dirty and stuff?  I really dont want the purse sent back to me at all.


I am so mad at ebay for not looking into the case more.  I don't want to cooperate with the refund.  What will happen if I don't cooperate?  The only things I can think of that ebay will do are 1) try to take money from either my paypal account or my bank account which is linked to paypal. 2) Try and charge my charge card which is linked to my ebay account.  Both of these options seem illegal for ebay to do without my permission, but I think they will still try.


I know ebay/paypal will probably cancel my account if I don't cooperate, but I am so mad at ebay.  Has anyone ever had ebay force them to accept a return they knew was unjust?



tl;dr..... I sold an authentic purse on ebay with certificate of authenticity, buyer says its fake, ebay is forcing me to accept return without investigating the case



*FOLLOW UP*

Ebay dropped the case.  The buyer tried to use a fake tracking number to prove the item was shipped back to me.  Since I did not sign for the return, and I assume the buyer was not responding, ebay decided to drop the case and return my negative balance to 0.  This whole thing was a pain in the ass though.  Had to call ebay and wait on hold several times.  Also could not sell anything or use paypal for a whole month while this dispute was going on.",20,9,2012-01-30,EBAY,0.28753477334976196,0.6902164816856384,0.022248728200793266
