Ebay,ebay shipping options...I'm losing my mind!,"I've been doing a lot of research online on various websites, forums, ebay support, Canada Post etc...and I feel like I'm going to lose it. When I list an item these are the shipping options I am presented with for domestic, US and International. http://i.imgur.com/QYFGduw.png

How on earth am I supposed to know the difference between what a Light Packet is vs a Small Packet, vs a USA Letter vs etc...etc... Most of my items I just want to put into a bubble mailer and send them off as cheaply as possible. On top of that, when I choose international shipping it still lists all the USA options...why does it even do that? 

I'm just not sure what qualifies as a letter or a packet or a light packet or a small packet. I don't want to choose the wrong one and then end up paying extra shipping out of pocket because the dimensions of my package are bigger than the shipping option I chose.

Ebay,"Buyer returning a (small) item as defective, need to vent and need some advice.","Sold an item, turned out to not work with the buyers equipment. Item does actually work fine. 

My fault for not knowing it would work with their system, and I'm fine with that. 

Asked the buyer to select ""wrong size"" to hopefully avoid the detect. They of course ignored it, then waited the maximum amount of time to send the item back after getting the label issued. 

Kicker is, they sent it back without the mounting screws. I asked eBay about it, got transferred quite a few times and I was advised to just refund them then appeal the defect. 

I asked the buyer about it, they claimed it didn't come with them. Pictures in the auction you can kind of see it, and I have pictures taken during the shipping process showing the screws in the package (blister pack).

So yeah. I'm kinda being a jerk I guess not immediately refunding. But I don't totally appreciate being lied to. I mean, seriously, fess up and say sorry and you'll throw them in a envelope. 

Thoughts? Deadline for the refund is Thursday (lol, 16 minutes!).

Ebay,"Crazy scam - dozens of unauthorized purchases, now items actually being sent to my house (without being paid for)?","Just wanted to see if this has happened to anyone. 


I have an ebay account, rarely use it.  Yesterday I checked my email for the first time all week and had over 20 emails saying ""Please pay for (item)"" with things ranging from iPhones to macbooks to PS4s.  I logged into my eBay account and noted most of these listings had been removed or the sales cancelled. I noticed an older message, from the day before, saying my email address had been changed (but it hadn't). 


So I changed my password, logged out, forgot about it.  Today, 8 more emails asking me to pay for stuff. And when I get home from work, an iPhone in my mailbox!  

I called eBay customer support and talked to two people who I swear to god had to be really convincing androids, but not actually humans, with weird speech patterns and inconsistencies in answering my questions.  They advised me to reset my password. One of them verified my identity by asking weirdly personal questions (from a public database she said), about things like vehicles I had owned, places I had lived, and my father's age.  They also recommended I just take this iPhone back to the post office and tell them to return it to the sender.  I noted that the seller in question has only had his account since Tuesday, and that he has 0 feedback.  So this whole thing seems sketchy. Worst thing is, I have another notification that some other bs item has been shipped (another iPhone, no less).

Ebay,What should I do about this buyers issue?,"So I sold an LCD watch with a popular wrestler on it.  Sealed in original packaging, the batteries were working but it's a good 6 years old so I mentioned that they might die by the time the buyer gets it.  I sold the watch last week Friday night and the buyer got it yesterday.  They sent me this message today:

""Hello! 

I appreciate the fast shipping, however the watch does not work. When it arrived, it had no power at all. After paying $6.50 to have the battery replaced, the power is back on, but the buttons do not respond. I can get them to respond occasionally, but it would take me over an hour just to set the time &amp; date. How would you like to proceed?""

The watch was sold via best offer and I accepted an offer of $19 free shipping when my asking price was $24.  I feel bad that the watch doesn't function to the guys satisfaction but it's not really my fault and for all I know whoever replaced the battery messed it up or he could just be picky and the buttons are fine.

Ebay,Frustration with known problem buyer - what can I do?,"So I sold a lot recently, and lo and behold it was to a girl who's a known problem in that particular fandom/community. Notably, for harassing sellers. 
  
The auction ended two days ago. Since then, she has complained about the shipping price - unfortunately, I have never gotten an accurate amount from ebay's shipping calculator, so I requested in the listing that international buyers message me for a quote. She didn't do that. She requested I send her a picture of the receipt once I send it out - no problem, I assure her.  
Just got another message from her asking if the total was with the three items taken out that she requested. Again, what. Worried I may have missed something, I combed through both my email and messages on ebay. Nothing. I politely tell her I received no such request, and regardless everything comes together as-is. Note, she still hasn't sent payment, she's still trying to haggle with me, claiming she sent the request when she requested the invoice, but no. Nothing, all she requested was that I send a total. She's trying to backtrack because that was before she realized how much shipping was.  
While she's claiming that she will still pay the closing price even if I take those items out, personally I'm not crazy about the idea because it means I will still be stuck with those three items.   

Because she hasn't sent me money yet, can I do anything? Is it worth the hassle of trying to report her for unreasonable demands, or should I wait before jumping the gun here?",10,10,2015-10-02,EBAY,0.1011030524969101,0.8737776279449463,0.025119343772530556

Ebay,My son bought something using his grandpa's e-Bay account.,"My parents take my son to piano lessons and then he stays at their house until we pick him up Thursday nights. They allow him to use the laptop. My son is high-functioning autistic. He is very, very good with technology but has no concepts of work or money. When I say good with technology, I mean obsessed with technology. Its all he talks about. And his latest fascination is the XBox 360. Tonight he apparently googled the XBox 360 on Grandpa's laptop, and found two very nice ones on eBay while Grampy's account happened to be signed in. He Bought it Now on one of them for a hundred bucks and he bid $$$$ on the other. I don't know why $$$$ because the bid before that wasn't anywhere in the ballpark, I think he was just reading the validation error and realizing the number in that box had to be higher than whatever wasn't working right now. My girlfriend text me all this when she went to pick him up. 

My dad has sent a message to the sellers but I told him he needed to be on the phone with eBay support telling them someone else had purchased that from his account. Called and told Mom the same. Neither seemed worried. I pointed out that he might want to make sure his paypal account isn't connected via ACH or linked directly to a debit or credit card, but mom was convinced the credit card company wouldn't let a purchase for $$$$ go through.

So are they right? Is it a relatively simple matter to get a winning bid or a Buy it Now transaction voided? Or am I going to be selling a truck to pay off an XBox 360?

Ebay,PayPal / eBay Issues (10/4/2015) - Payments not showing up in PayPal,"Just a word of warning, this has happened with 3 buyers today and myself on a buying account.  Something is screwed up with PayPal right now and they aren't recording all payments.  It is not affecting every payment, but you might want to check your recent sales!

In all 4 cases that I've been involved with today, the following is true:

1) The eBay checkout completes as if everything went fine.  
2) PayPal shows no indication of the payment.  
3) The buyer's have confirmed (in 3 cases, 4th hasn't responded) that the pending charge is visible on their online bank/card statement.  
4) On the buying side, the status randomly changes where the paid icon is sometimes dim and sometimes lit up like it has been paid.  
5) On the selling side for my store, the payments show up as received.  

So far phone support hasn't been able to help other than telling me it ""should be fixed"" within 24-48 hours.

**EDIT:** 4 hours since first encountering the problems, the item I bought showed up on PayPal's end and the seller confirmed it appeared on their end as well.  On my selling account (which is a separate ebay and PayPal account), I've had another order show up with the same problem (and 2 without problems), and none of the previous instances have been fixed yet.

**EDIT #2:**  It looks like the payments are slowly showing up on PayPal, with a 2-3 hour delay.  So far everything has now shown up except for 2 orders from the last 2 hours, while all the previous ones that had issues are now showing up properly.

Ebay,Should I leave neutral/negative feedback?,"I've never left bad feedback before, always opting to just not leave feedback if I was a little chuffed with a transaction. But this is the first transaction I've had which has just pissed me off.

**Here's how it runs down:**

* **September 3rd**: Order brand new Amazon Fire phone with Prime, listing says it is SEALED in all caps many times.
* **September 12**: Phone arrives. Is *not* sealed and doesn't power on. Contact the seller and get back a message that they are out of office until September 16th for some Jewish holiday. Oh well, nothing I can do about that.

* **September 16th**: Finally receive word from them. Communication is very slow, often with a whole day between responses.

* **September 21st**: Finally able to get a return shipping label and send the phone back. Make it clear that I want a replacement (I got a good price and really wanted Prime).

* **September 24th**: Get a message saying that a replacement will be sent.

* **October 4th**: Haven't received any more messages from the seller, but I have now received a refund through PayPal.

So I received a phone that wasn't in the described condition, didn't power on, communication was very slow, and my money was tied up for over a month. They said they would send me a replacement and then instead gave me a refund.

Is this enough frustrating shit to warrant a neutral/negative feedback? I sell a lot on eBay and know that negative feedback should be a last resort, so I'm *very* wary about giving negative, but I feel like neutral may be warranted.",4,1,2015-10-04,EBAY,0.09148208051919937,0.8766130208969116,0.03190487623214722

Ebay,Question about the Global Shipping Program,"I'm just trying to see if I understand the Global Shipping Program and/or international shipping correctly.

A month ago I sold a 1980s G.I. Joe vehicle. I didn't realize the buyer was in Germany until he paid. I freaked out a little because I haven't sold anything internationally in years, and I vaguely remembered setting up my account to not sell to buyers outside the United States because of the general hassle: customs forms, lack of tracking, etc. But the sale was (somehow) oriented through the GSP, which seemed easy enough, so I sent it onto eBay's GSP processing location in Kentucky, and it arrived in Germany a week later. No problem.

But it's weird. It seems like all my current auctions are different. Some specify that they can be shipped to the US only, others have a list of countries that are included and excluded. But I didn't set up the auctions differently from each other, so I'm not sure where these international-shipping discrepancies are coming from. I ask because I have an auction tonight where the high bidder is located in South Africa. The GSP shipping option is checked (and can't be unchecked) when I go to the edit-listing page, but the edit-listing page also specifies that I don't ship to several countries, Africa included.

Here's a visual: http://imgur.com/f2uw8u0

It's my understanding that unless you opt out of the GSP in your account settings, international buyers can still bid on/buy your items, thus overriding your selling restrictions. Is that the case?",6,8,2015-10-05,EBAY,0.037659112364053726,0.9213443398475647,0.04099654033780098

Ebay,"Important question about being safe, please help","Hi everyone, I'm thinking whether or not I should buy an item from a person... This is what I was told:

The transaction is safe and secure for both of us:

- I will set up the transaction with eBay;
- eBay will send you and invoice which you will have to pay it in maximum 48 hours using your online Bank account or an
local Bank office
( bank transfer not payment by paypal )
- eBay will receive and hold the money into a secured account until you receive and inspect the product;
- If the product will be as described, you will inform eBay and they will transfer me the money within 2 business days.
- If the product will not be as described, you will have 14 days to return it on my expense and you will get a full refund
from eBay.
Please notice that the money will be sent to eBay and not to me and will be hold by eBay until you receive the package.

Now, based on what I've been told this looks incredibly secure since I can INSPECT the product as well... But it almost sounds too good to be true; is this legit?

Ebay,"Bought $2200+ laser cutter with 2 year warranty, seller wont fix or partial refund, and I cant mail back. What to do?","Long story short, I bought a cheapish laser cutter on ebay on August 24th, knowing full well it wouldnt be perfect out of the box .... however:

1. The glass on top you cant see through its so damaged
2. The control system only works half the time. 
3. The water cooling system is faulty and missing parts. 
4. 1 usb port is broken, the other you have to take apart the machine to access
5. the cutting area is 10%+ smaller then advertised (which is actually a big problem since most my patterns now are too big)
6. The air compressor and fillers sold are so weak, they are useless.

I only bought it from this seller because it says:
1. From Ontario California (2 hours from me)
2. 2 year warranty
3. Free return shipping
4. Satisfaction Guarantee or money back. 

All that to say, I have now sent 5 messages and 2 phone calls to CS to take advantage of the warranty or a partial refund for at least the cost of the Control system being replaced so I can use it. Ebay and paypal both are willing to give me a full refund, however I would have to send it back, which I will do if need me. Problem is that I would have to rent a truck, find a way to repackage it, drive an hour away to the closest place that will accept a package of this size and weight (500lbs, 3'x5'ish) ... which all would cost me $300+ and a days work. Sucks, but I will do it if I have too. (ebay provided me a shipping label, but USPS wont honor it because of the weight of the item)

What I really want is them just to at least pay for 1 of the new parts it needs, a new control system, which is $450+labor. Which they wont because ... ""my dear customer,the money 450USD is too much for us ,could you please just reduce a little ? we really want to help you to fit this matter,is that okay ? do you know 450usd = 2790RMB,it is almost my salary of one month."" and ""we will not let you have any loss, now ,may i ask you ,what do you think ? we will respect your choice ,.is that okay ? we really understand your feeling ."" and Cos the National Day during 1/10 to 7/10 in China, we do not work during that time, so we can not reply to you soon.""

Yea, the seller that I thought was in California is actually in China (I shouldnt have been surprised). 

Ebay and paypal have both suggested that I wait until after the 13th to see if they will honor the Warranty before I ""escalate the claim"". Not sure what that means. Biggest problem is that I need this machine to work before the holiday season (its for my shop), and its already been over a month. I could purchase what it needs myself, but I have already put over $500 into fixes and work arounds for the other faulty parts of this machine, I just dont have the capital.

Ebay,eBay being eBay. At their finest.,"1000+ feedback, zero negs until yesterday. I saw I received a neg on a cheap item, so the first thing I did was search my messages for  any communication from the buyer. Nothing. Then I wrote the buyer a message apologizing that they were not satisfied and telling them that I would gladly give them a full refund and they could keep the item. And told them in the future, please message or call me and I would rectify whatever their problem was. 

I haven't heard anything back from the buyer yet, but I called eBay to see if I could get it removed. At some point in the conversation the rep let it slip that the buyer messaged us 3 weeks ago wanting to return the item. The problem is I never received that message. The eBay rep even confirmed that the message never went through to us even though they could see it. 

So now I'm stuck with a neg, an unhappy customer &amp; eBay will do absolutely nothing about it.

Ebay,How should I handle this refund request / how screwed am I?,"Canada seller. USA buyer bought an expensive vintage silver bracelet from me.

Ebay,"I bought a motherboard on ebay, listed as tested and working. Motherboard does NOT function, seller rejected return and paypal claim got closed.","I bought a motherboard on ebay on 9/23 and received and installed it on 9/24.   Immediately experienced system instability and random shutdowns (instant shutdowns, as if the power got yanked).  I communicated with the seller about the issues I was having, and the two of us went through a great deal of troubleshooting to try and find the source.   I figured it was the motherboard, as the entire system was functioning perfectly fine up until this point. In an effort to do my due diligence, I went through the process of systematically eliminating systems components until the very last item left was the motherboard.   Every single component in the system had been swapped out one by one for another until only the motherboard remained.   All of the other components I tried, were from other currently working systems.   At no point during all of this, did the seller acknowledge that the motherboard may be bad, he is simply confused but slightly sympathetic.

At this point, it's safe to say I got a bad motherboard.   Seller indicated he was confused about why it wouldn't run for me, but that I should open a return.   On 9/28, I opened a return and he immediately rejected the return, claiming that I simply had buyers remorse, or that I purchased the wrong size motherboard (ATX), and that I should simply sell it myself.

On 9/28 I opened a paypal dispute and immediately escalated it to a claim - Paypal never contacted me, but the claim history shows they emailed the seller twice and called him once.  Today, on 10/7, Paypal shows the claim as closed, with the notes: ""After careful consideration, we're unable to decide this claim in your favor at this time.""

So now I'm out $124 for a motherboard that I cannot resell because *I* believe it's broken, and the Seller still has my money.   I cannot dispute this transaction with my payment processor, because I did not use a credit card for it (debit card).


Also:  
-In his correspondence, seller claims to be an avid overclocker.
-In his correspondence, seller claims to have purchased insurance on this item.
-Seller has over 600 positive ratings on ebay, with 0 negatives (100% rating).
-I have ~~screenshots~~ *copies* of all correspondence with the seller (through eBay's messaging system), and while he does not say that he knows it has a problem, I find it very suspicious that he talks a lot about his experience overclocking AND that he purchased insurance for this auction..  Maybe I'm reading too far into that.
-I was not overclocking my cpu or ram on this motherboard - the seller was suggesting that I was based on his experience and some temperatures I referenced.

Is there anything I can do about this or am I completely out of luck here?   This is so frustrating.   I spent 12+ hours working on my computer and it's still down and I'm even farther behind on getting it fixed.

Suggestions?

**UPDATE**
So after reading replies, I decided to take a closer look at the return and found out I had selected ""Wrong Size"" as the reason..   The idiot is me.

Ebay,Not sure if scam or eBay noob.,"I am selling my iPad mini 2. I was asking $200 for it. It didn't sell today so it automatically got relisted. When it did about an hour later I get an offer for $240 and this weird note.

I would also like to know if the item is in good condition and would like to pay today.""

Her first email: 
""This dryer is very weak.... Meaning it does not blow strong.... You did not clarify in your description the strength of the blower.... Please let's arrange for return or for substantial refund.""  

Now she said she is going to dispute because even though it works, the horsepower is not as high as she would like.  
Another email: , I'm terrible sorry to disagree.... Under description you wrote...and I quote: ""used only a few times."" 

That is not a characterization of anything. And furthermore someone asked you about horsepower and you gave a vague answer. I'm starting the dispute process today...so we are all doing it in a safe environment! Thank you

This was my email to her:

As far as I can tell, the AFTD-1 only comes in one strength: 1.17 HP. The company does make other dryers that are stronger, but the model number is all the information needed to ascertain the strength. As the model number was clearly listed in the item description, the item was described""

Ebay,I just can't seem to understand seller fees.,"Hey guys. So, I've been selling for a few months now, but I still haven't been able to figure out seller fees (most notably insertion fees). I started off selling customized toys (in the $20-$70 range, few sales a month), and now most of my sales come from collectible/trading cards ($2-$15, 100+ sales a month).

I've read the section regarding fees over many times, but for whatever reason it just doesn't click. I keep seeing ""insertion fees"" mentioned. This is a fee for listing an item, right? Is this only applicable to certain listings? Or to certain sellers?

Whenever I have listed/revised an item, I've always seen ""Fee: $o.oo"" or ""Free."" I thought maybe it was because I was selling so few items (I read somewhere that the first 100 in a month are free?), but this month my limit got bumped up to 200 listings per month, and despite having already maxed that 200 limit, I'm still not seeing any fees.

As far as ""eBay's cut,"" I think I understand that a little bit better. Basically they get 10% of any sale, yeah? Except it's not taken out right away. I'm usually charged about 10% of my monthly sales around the middle of every month. At least, that's what I assuming is going on.

So could someone please help me figure out the whole insertion fee thing, and exactly how much is being deducted from sales? I'm a stay at home dad, and because of personal reasons I don't really have access to the family funds, but I've been doin' this eBay thing on the side to help better learn to manage finances, but I want to make sure I'm not eating a loss from fees or anything.

Ebay,Seller threatening and harassing me after filing claim. How should I handle it?,"So I ordered an item from the seller. It was listed as within 1 day handling time, but over a week later, the shipping info listed it as not having been shipped. After the expected arrival date came and went with it still being ""label created,"" I contacted the seller, and he said he didn't have time to look into it. I contacted FedEx, and they said they hadn't received the item, so I waited a bit longer and finally filed an item not received claim, figuring I could close it if I received the item.

The seller immediately flips out and throws a huge tantrum in the claim messaging. Suddenly he has time. He sends multiple messages on the claim page repeatedly swearing me out, insulting me, and physically threatening me. Even after he repeatedly raged out, I've been professional and reasonable with him, plainly explaining my position. Finally, around two weeks later, the item is scanned near his home town *after* he told me he would be driving several states over to pick it up in person.

So it looks like the package is incoming, but the guy's nuts. It's obvious the handling time was way misrepresented. I needed the item at least some time around the expected date and didn't have it. He's still threatening and insulting me on the claim page. I can't find any way to specifically report him for it, and it seems like it's not actually against the rules because it's member-to-member. The date that eBay gives in which they would intervene was extended, and it looks like I will receive the package a few weeks after ordering it. I don't even want to open it, because I don't trust this guy, but I can't find any solution through eBay. 

Should I leave the item not arrived claim open for a record of communication between us? Could I call eBay over it? Do I have recourse, or should I just forget about it? My main thing is I don't trust a package by him, but he has a no return policy.",6,6,2015-10-12,EBAY,0.06017723307013512,0.911528468132019,0.028294282034039497
Ebay,"Item not delivered, tracking says 'Moved, Left no Address', but I sent another item to same address the day before with no issue","Buyer purchased an item on October 2nd and I sent the package Priority the next morning.  Buyer opens an INR on the 10th, asking me if the item has been returned to me because tracking says 'Undeliverable as Addressed'. I check the tracking and sure enough I see 'Undeliverable as Addressed' followed by 'Moved, Left no Address'.  Which is very strange, as this is a repeat customer who last purchased from me literally the day before on Oct 1st.  The first item reached it's destination without incident, however the second item, sent the very next day, could not be delivered because USPS thinks he moved and left no forwarding address within 24 hours of receiving the first package.

So I messaged the buyer and told him that I had not received the item back, but will gladly refund in full (if no longer interested) or resend the item once I receive it back. The buyer is being cool about it and still wants the item, so he is going to contact USPS tomorrow and let me know what they say. I just do not want to send the item again and risk having it returned for a second time.

My question is: When I resend the item, do I have to pay for shipping again? Or is there some sort of claim I can file with USPS? Clearly (to me anyway) the USPS is at fault for not delivering the package.  The address is correct and confirmed, the person I sent it to can confirm that they did not move or change their address and as proof, USPS delivered a package to the exact same person at that exact same address just the day before.

Any ideas?",9,6,2015-10-12,EBAY,0.033043742179870605,0.9268990755081177,0.04005718231201172
Ebay,I won a refund case but money was taken out of my paypal to refund the buyer anyways.,"Buyer tried to get a refund on a product that they damaged 2 weeks after receiving. Ebay saw that they left good feedback on the item as soon as they received it so they sided with me on the case and closed it without giving the buyer the refund. 

An hour later, money gets pulled straight out of my bank account to refund the buyer. I called ebay and asked what was up. I went through 2 call reps before the third one (supposedly in the correct department) told me that he saw that the case was closed in my favor and I needed my money returned to me. He said my request would be added to a list of similar requests and that it would need to be taken care of manually by him, but that it would be taken care of within 5 days. 

So they told me it would be resolved. But without thinking, I asked for no confirmation of this and simply thanked him before ending the call. He also told me before hanging up that if it doesn't get resolved, he would be forced to call me back to get it done and that I had no reason to call back, and that I just had to wait. 

Does this seem fishy to anyone? Should I call back tomorrow and ask for some sort of documentation that my money will be returned to me? I'm kind of worried at this point. 

UPDATE: just called ebay. got a US call rep immediately. I asked her to check up on what I was told yesterday and she said that there was indeed a note on my account stating that my account was in the process of getting a refund. She said it was a manual process in the sense that the representative i spoke to yesterday needed to write an email to paypal detailing the fix.

Ebay,Ebay &amp; Paypal Claim question,"Hey /r/ebay

So quick summary. I bought a fairly expensive soccer ball off eBay. I get it mid week, pump it up to check for deformities, seems fine.  I brought it out to my game on Sunday and reinflated it (not unusual as these balls are known to lose quite a bit of air within a few days) at the field. 30 minutes into the game, the ball had lost so much air that it was unplayable. I contacted the seller to try to get a refund but he won't refund it because it's used. I filed a claim with eBay to only see eBay rule for the seller for the same reason. 

I tried to appeal and the eBay CSR said that I may consider filing a case with Paypal. My thinking is that how am I to know a ball won't hold air until I actually use it? By the time I've used it, I can no longer return it for defects. Is it even worth filing a complaint via Paypal or should I just suck it up, chunk the ball and use this up to a learning experience on eBay? 

Edit : Forgot that the ball was listed as "" CONDITION : BRAND NEW. ORIGINAL. 100% AUTHENTIC"" 

Edit 2 : eBay appeals ruled in my favor. They agreed that a new ball should hold air and finding out it can't hold air is something that you find out after using it.",19,5,2015-10-12,EBAY,0.029335148632526398,0.9203211069107056,0.05034378170967102

Ebay,Items purchased were damaged &amp; overpaid for shipping.,"Ok so I left feedback way earlier than I should- I was just so excited that the package came 2 days early. Dumb move, because the package smelled overwhelmingly like stale smoke. Upon inspecting the items, I found that each vinyl figure (there are 14) has a very strong cigarette smell. 

These items are highly collectible (Littlest Pet Shop) and I buy them with the intent to resell, or give to my daughters to play with. I'm not sure how or whether I will be able to get rid of the smell, as I'm afraid that most treatments I know of might damage the vinyl or paint. They were described as ""some might have some scuff marks... most are in like new condition."" 

Is there anything I can do, even though I already left positive feedback? I might be able to get the smell down enough for my daughters, but they won't have the value that they should have- is there a way to ask for a partial refund?

Also, and I probably wouldn't have even noticed this if it hadn't been for the smoke damage, they charged me almost double what they actually paid for postage. 

I don't want to seem nit-picky, but I wouldn't have paid what I did for these, had I known about the smoke damage. What can I do?

EDIT: It turns out that I *was* overcharged for shipping- the listing said that it would be expedited/priority shipping and that's what I was charged for. However the seller shipped standard instead of priority at almost half the cost. 

EDIT 2: I did end up contacting the seller instead of filing a claim &amp; didn't mention the shipping charges. I asked if they'd consider a partial refund. If they agree, case closed. If they counter by offering a full refund &amp; agree to pay for the return postage, case closed.

Ebay,"Worst purchase experience of my life, and feedback automatically removed. Could I reinstate?","So I bought an item, item wasn't shipped until after I filed an INR claim days after arrival date. In the claim, seller harasses and threatens me for days. I escalate, ebay sees the item was received right on the escalation date, so case is closed, and my feedback is automatically removed. I call ebay, they see his days-long tantrum, apologize profusely on his behalf, and begin the return process.

I decide to open the package to check and find on top of everything else, the ""new in box with manual"" item has absolutely no box, is scuffed and scratched from heavy use, and poorly packed. Of course the seller is using the return messaging to harass and threaten some more. So anyway, I posted pictures, and I expect ebay to back my return.

Ebay,Am I being scammed?,"I put an iPhone 5 with a cracked screen up for sale because I've had my new phone for a while now and could use the extra cash as a college student. Yesterday I got a notification that someone had bid on the item at the minimum price ($95), which I don't find suspicious. The user has 17 positive ratings.

Early this afternoon, someone with 115 ratings bids for $100. Cool. The buy it now price sat at $125.

Then, out of nowhere, a user with 22 ratings bids for $500, and lastly a user with 3 ratings bids for $510.

This is obviously a scam, right? I'm totally a novice when it comes to eBay but there's no way someone is actually paying $510 for an iPhone 5 with a cracked screen, especially if the buy it now price was $125. I'm guessing they'd want it shipped and then cancel the payment?

Ebay,"Buyer contacted me AFTER winning 2 auctions, requested combined postage for 2 items, then wasn't happy with the new p&amp;p price I provided - now wants to cancel purchase.","I'm only an occasional eBay seller, and recently listed a few items of clothing as I'm having a clear out.  The same person bid on and won 2 of my items, and then contacted me AFTER bidding had ended to request that I combine the postage for the 2 items.

I'd like to make it clear at this point that I hadn't mentioned anything about being able to combine postage on my listings, and from googling this earlier today, I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) that the seller is not obligated to combine postage.  A lot of the posts I read stated that buyers should contact the seller BEFORE bidding if they wish to request combined postage where a listing doesn't state this is provided, otherwise their bid is an agreement to pay as per the prices on the listing - the terms of sale as displayed.

However, as a gesture of goodwill, I looked into how much more it would cost me to send the 2 items in one bulkier, heavier parcel on the Royal Mail website.  I then sent an invoice for this new postage cost - I chose the cheapest option available, which was less than the p&amp;p I'd listed for the 2 items combined, and didn't include any charges for the actual packaging materials I would be using - purely the postage alone.

The buyer then responded, and requested that I only charge the p&amp;p for one item.  I explained that combining the two items into one parcel would make the parcel bulkier/weigh more, and that this had a knock on effect on the pricing of the parcel, and I therefore couldn't charge less than the invoice I'd sent.  I also pointed out that, as my listing did not mention any options to combine postage, I was under no obligation to do so, and was doing so as a gesture of goodwill (I didn't point out that the buyer should have contacted me BEFORE bidding, or that she shouldn't have bid at all if she didn't agree with the advertised p&amp;p charges...)

The buyer has now responded saying ""I'm a seller too, I know how much postage costs"", and says she wants to cancel her purchases.  What I'm now concerned about is (a) how to go about allowing the purchases to be cancelled without taking any hit on my fees, and (b) whether she will be able to leave a negative feedback on my seller account - even though, in my opinion, she's in the wrong since in bidding on my items without contacting me first, she entered a legally binding contract to pay for the item as listed (including the p&amp;p listed).

Can anyone advise me on the best way to proceed with this?  I only sell things every now and then when I'm having a clear out, and have never had any problems before.

Also, sorry for the essay...",13,5,2015-10-15,EBAY,0.06409738212823868,0.905915379524231,0.029987288638949394
Ebay,"Sold video card on ebay. Buyer claims it is defective, demands partial refund, threatens PayPal claim, refuses my offer of free tech support and full refund assuming he returns the card to me. How should I handle this?","I sold a video card on ebay for $64. The buyer (w/6 positive feedback) bid on it even though my auction stated buyers with 10 feedback minimum. The buyer also paid not until after four days and a reminder (auction details stated payment must be made within three days). I tried to be nice and give him the benefit of the doubt and sold him the card anyway. 

Now he claims the card is defective and does not work properly in his PC. He demands a partial refund of first $25 and now $30 so he can take it to a tech store to have it fixed (which doesn't make any sense). 

I first denied his claim since I know I sent him a working card and my auction details were 100% truthful, plus the sale was 'as is' anyway. 

He came back and threatened to escalate it with ebay and then PayPal if I didn't pay up. However, if I gave him the partial refund he would post positive feedback and close the issue. 

I decided to try taking the high road. I responded to him I will offer him free tech support to help him diagnose the issue, and asked him to send me his computer specs and details of the actual problem. If we cannot make it work, I offered him a full refund of the purchase price after he returns the card to me in the exact same condition as he received it. 

Next thing I know, I get an email from PayPal because he opened a claim with them asking yet again for a partial refund of $30. I denied it and responded that again, I am willing to provide free tech support and refund the money if he returns it. 

Now waiting for a response. 

What is going on here? This reeks like a scam to me because no tech store in the world can fix a defective video card for $30 and he is not responding to my offer to help or refund after he returns the card. 

How should I handle this? What will ebay and PayPal do if he ignores my offer for help and continues with his claims? Is there an actual arbitration of sorts where I can make my case and show I'm willing to do the right thing? Or is this whole thing automated and he can either blackmail me into the refund to make him go away or get his entire purchase money back from PayPal if he (falsely) claims I did not respond or cooperate and I am then screwed out of both the card and my money? What protection do I have as a seller from potential scams like this?

She said she is able to go to the shop who manufactures it, get a certificate of proof that it's a replica, and then she will use this to complain to ebay. She said this is her only option unless I give her a full refund.

Ebay,Is the USPS really sucking for anyone else? Worse than usual? Looking for advice.,"I just pulled 30 packages back into my house after not being picked up today and am wondering what recourse I have.  (Yes, they were scheduled )

I used to have problems with getting packages picked up (as in my mailman matter-of-factly telling me that the post office was not far and I was more than welcome to take my packages there myself...) I then just started taking them in to their back dock and ringing the bell so I didn't have to deal with the POS mailman. After a while they started ignoring me and I would be waiting on the dock for 20+ minutes for them to come to the door.  I spoke to management and was assured that pickup requests would not be a problem so I went back to scheduling them. 

I am now dealing with missed pickups 3-4 times a month.  One of the first times they blamed it on me not having the boxes out early enough.  I showed them the online form that stated pickup was between 3 and 5. A couple days later the form's verbage changed so now I have to have my pickup outside before 9am, just in case.  They still don't typically pickup until 4 or 5, but I have to have the items ready for their convenience and they still don't pickup a few times a month. (I am scheduling pickups around 5 days a week).

The last time it happened I emailed (it was after hours) and got a very generic response that took no responsibility.  My mail woman apologized up and down, saying they are moving routes around and we don't have a set person right now,  but that is not my problem. I have spoken yo the supervisor and he assured me each time that it would not happen again,  yet here I am.

What else can I do? Am I at the mercy of their poor service? I cannot go stand in line with 30 packages, and I shouldn't have to anyway. They advertise the service and it should be able to be used at the customer's convenience,  not theirs.

On May 4th I opened a case asking the seller about the product. He replied the same day informing me that the product was a pre-order item, that the manufacturer was having manufacturing issues, but that they would have the product available by the end of that month.

Just to be on the safe side, on May 19th I opened a Buyer Protection Case, but had till June 3rd to escalate the case or eBay would close it.

On June 4th the seller contacted me, told me the item was released and ready to ship, and asked me to close the Buyer Protection Case. I told him I would, and then received an email from eBay informing me that they automatically closed the case because I never escalated it. 

In mid-August I again asked about the product, but never received a response.

Here's where I panic and (possibly?) commit the cardinal sin of selling on eBay according to a ton of community threads, and I immediately move to cancel it out. NO MONEY HAS BEEN EXCHANGED when I did this. Afterwards, because hindsight is 20/20, I start reading all the posts saying that people who cancel open themselves up to request denials, stick me with (the $95 worth of) final value fees I apparently now have, etc.

I wake up this morning to find that my cancel request is ignored and instead I have another message in semi-broken English asking for my Paypal info again so I can be ""paid immediately"", and also asking me for my personal phone number. 

I've reported the buyer for trying to circumvent eBay with the transaction and also for trying to get personal info out of me. I've called eBay CS twice and both times they've said I can relist immediately (not happening, I'm spooked enough) and that all I seemingly have to do is wait for the cancellation to run its course. I can apparently also call to remove anything negative if I have to. But this seems to run counter to all the things I'm seeing about cancel request denials, etc.

So, keeping in mind that in the eyes of the eBay community I'm apparently a total mouth-breathing idiot that screwed himself over...:

Is there any way I can expedite the closure of this? Or am I stuck panicking for 10 days in the fear that I'll get my request denied and get held payment-hostage by a scammer with no intent to pay for XX MORE days, and get stuck with $95 in value fees too?

Is the ""no big deal"" vibe I'm getting from CS because they're clowns, or because I moved quickly before getting payment even entered the equation?

If I DO end up with a request denial, what are my obligations at that point? Do I just contest (or pay) the Final Value Fees and problem solved?

Again, no money changed hands. I'm not sure how eBay is saying they're ""waiting for a confirmation from buyer of refund"", but there's no money to even give back. 

I'm sure as hell not giving the camera up at this point, and I have no desire to even sell it anymore, so the prospect of negative feedback or whatever doesn't bother me. Almost every time I/my family has tried to use eBay in recent memory, it's ended in scammer drama, so I just want out at this point. 

Thanks for putting up with this wall of text.",4,3,2015-10-17,EBAY,0.09285211563110352,0.8844150900840759,0.022732863202691078
Ebay,Is it normal to be a bit worried about purchasing from a new(er) seller?,"Today I purchased an item from a user who has 3 total sales with 3 positive feedback..but due to lack of information after my payment I just feel odd. I purchased 3 other items today..all auction and the other 3 sellers had expected dates off arrival and whatnot. And over 1000 positive feedback. Im not necessarily new to ebay. This is my personal account..before hand my father would make purchases on his account. Also the item which I won went only about a dollar or two over what the starting bid was. Is it normal for newer sellers to just ditch out..make a new account and try again? Maybe I'm overthinking things, but I've just wondered if anyone else has experienced this or had the buying from new seller jitters. Note the seller has had an account a little over a year. And he had placed 4 otger individual items on ebay all around the same time which ended today. I suppose Im also wondering if there's sellers who just use it everyonce in awhile or this could be a potential scam.",3,2,2015-10-17,EBAY,0.029787078499794006,0.9237194657325745,0.04649341106414795
Ebay,Guitar damaged during shipping,"Hi Guys,

I bought a guitar on ebay, unfortunately it arrived yesterday with a big crack at the headstock/scarf joint area of the neck. I have contacted the buyer and he says he paid for it to be packed and shipped by an authorized 3rd party UPS shipper that is not the UPS store. However, I think he may be lying because the box was used from guitar center and it was packed with only shredded paper, no bubble wrap at all. It was packed in a hard case and surrounded by shredded paper in a used box. He says he will contact the company that shipped it because he had it insured. I have provided pictures and responded to all of his messages, but I can already tell that he is going to be dragging his heels the whole way if UPS doesn't settle this.

He already has my money, what is my recourse here? How do these situations usually work out for the buyer (I paid through paypal, but stupidly used my bank account instead of my credit card). Should I open up a case with ebay?

If UPS shows up at my house or the seller demands me to return the item, should I wait until getting my money back give the guitar away? I was going to offer to have it repaired and let him eat the cost for the repair, but I'm afraid it would look like I am trying to scam him.

Ebay,"Just made an account yesterday, and it's been combined with someone else's?","I'm having a really weird problem. I made an account yesterday, updated all the personal info, linked paypal, and had everything good to go. I get back on a few moments ago and I see on the drop down menu, that my last name is wrong, I have a feedback score of 36, but my username/ID is correct. My first thought is that I've been hacked somehow. I proceed to my account settings, and the username/ID is now different, but only one character off from what I had made mine during setup, and has the same feedback score. I look at personal information section, and I can see this guy's full name and address. His email and phone had been asterisked out, but that's how it showed mine during setup, so I'm assuming I can see this person's actual account info.

Yet when I click on ""Activity"" and ""Messages"" tabs, my username is correct and my feedback is zero, like it should be. So being genuinely confused and concerned, I go to unlink my paypal, (or his, who knows at this point) and it takes me to a login screen, which I assume it does for every account change; I log in, and now the ""Account"" tab is reading my correct username, and the paypal section is unlinked. Having thought it was fixed, I close out my browser, relaunch, go to ebay (I had saved login), hover over name for drop down menu, and it's still a combination of both of our accounts.

Ebay,"Weird eBay situation, looking for your opinions and guidance.","So last week a potential buyer sent me an offer on an item.  I then responded with a counteroffer and didn't hear back from them.  Then eBay notified me a few days later that the same person that sent me the offer bought the doll but had not paid yet.  The buyer then messaged me a day later and said that she received an invoice for the full price instead of my counteroffer.

When I looked into it, it looks like the offer expired but the item's best offer was accepted but eBay did in fact charge her full price.  I'm guessing maybe they had the counteroffer up on their screen for a few days, it expired, but they accepted it anyways?  I don't really know.  

So then I messaged the lady and said that I would send her an updated invoice.  Come to find out, you can't change the price for the item on an invoice, just the shipping.

I then went to call the lady by the phone number that is under her address.  The number is not in service.  So then I Googled her address and it shows some article about abandoned properties and her address is one of them.

Ebay,"Odd situation, what are my rights?","Hi there, I've found myself in an odd situation this week that doesn't sit right with me, so I'd love to know what I should do.

I won an auction for a rare book last week ($299, +10 s&amp;h), but as I was about to pay, I was sent a message telling me ""do not pay, I told my boyfriend to take this auction down last night"".
Instantly I thought this was quite poor, but I was in no position to argue.

Fast forward 8 days and I find that the original seller has relisted the item for $50 more. Understandably, I'm confused, so I message the fella saying ""our correspondence told me not to pay, yet you've relisted it. What is going on?""

The response outlined that the item belongs to the seller's boyfriend and the owner didn't want it sold for $299, rather it should have been listed for $350. 

I then got an email 10 minutes later telling me that the seller has talked to his boyfriend (the book owner), and the owner is willing to sell it to me for $330 (plus shipping).

This all seems rather shady to me, so I ask, what are my rights here? 
Should I complain to eBay?

At the end of the day, if I am told that the seller is well within his right to do this, then I'll most likely refuse purchase and purchase it from someone else (even if I have to pay a higher price).

Ebay,Electronic Board Repair Service problems,"I purchased an electronic repair service listing, I've done it before from other sellers and had no problems at all. This time, a 100% positive rating seller, sent the board  back to me after servicing with the same problems as it went out to him. I'm 100% sure the board is deffective because I have another in good working condition which I use to test the appliance before determining that the board is indeed bad. 

I contact the seller and he says that everything is checked before shipping back, and there is no returns. I do see that he has changed some parts but the board is not working. So I open a case up and ebay responds that they cannot help me because they don't offer money back benefit for ""repair service"" items.

I go back to the seller and ask him very kindly to help me out, since I did pay him but he did not complete his job as offered. He replies ""all boards are tested prior to shipping"".. Ok, I get it. 

Next I contact PayPal and even though they take their sweet time, once again, they say nothing can be done. I opened this case as ""not as described"" because the item does not work. I don't quite get how they favor the seller up to this point, but well, they do.. 

So then, I tried to do the obvious and leave a negative feedback so that the next buyer does not end up like me. 
Unbelivable as it may sound, I'm not able to leave feedback now because I opened up a case and it was decided in favor of the seller!

So, I'm out of $72 with a non working board... What can I do next?

Just to ad a happy ending, I did find a webpage where they showed me what parts and how to fix my board myself, I spent $10 and its running again!

Ebay,"Buyer wants refund on PC after 3 weeks, what are my options?","I sold my PC with monitors to a guy who lives roughly 3 miles from me. The buyer mentioned that he asked if he could do a cash in hand transaction and said he sent the message through eBay, unfortunately I never received this (assuming this is his first lie). 

After he paid, I asked him if he would like all the original packaging that came with the components for the pc and if he would prefer to do a cash in hand transaction since he didn't live that far from me. He gets annoyed that I even offer the suggestion of cash in hand because he has already paid with PayPal. After looking up his address and noticing he lives with in 10 minutes drive from me I offered to drop the PC and parts to him the next day as I would be heading out during the evening.

This is the same time I start having doubts about sending the PC and parts without tracking information assuming that he could say he never received the item and I would have no way of proving I have sent it. I message him stating that I don't feel comfortable sending everything untracked as it is over £1000 and he gets even angrier because ""it is his daughters birthday and I will ruin it"". After finalising with him that it is not my concern if I ruin is daughters birthday I would much rather protect myself from any fraudulent activities and will send it with One day shipping even though I specifically mentioned in the AD I would confirm who I would ship with because I don't have everything boxed up and ready to send and it would be two days, things become quiet.

Now the PC is is delivered on 30th September. He contacted me yesterday (18th October nearly 3 weeks!) saying that the graphic card is broken. Hold on a minute... you desperately wanted this computer for your daughters birthday and it has taken 3 weeks to notice that graphic card does not work? Furthermore he goes and ""hires"" an ""it technician who is a qualified engineer who works for major London companies"" to attempt to diagnose and fix the problem. He also now wants me to pay for his ""tech"" guy which cost him £200.

Now here comes the funny part. I personally build and repair PCs and Laptops and know how things work inside them. For any of you who don't know about hardware and how it all fits in together, the graphic card is held in place with a screw and hook latch like mechanism. By being screwed into the desktop case and locked onto the motherboard the graphic card is sturdy enough to survive bumps on the road. The customer seriously believes that ""whilst the PC was in an upright position in transit all the bumps the van has gone over it has become dislodged by bouncing up and down"". WHAT IN THE FUCK?! This makes 0 sense. The only way a graphic card is going to come out is by pressing on the clip that he has broken because it is hook-latch system and removing the screw that holds it firmly on to the desktop case and pulling it towards you. This requires a bit of effort, not some bumps in the road. There are plenty of youtube videos that show how to install and remove a graphic card, bumps in the road will have 0 effect unless the van was dropped from a plane...

He also comments saying that because I have formatted the PC I should have removed the graphic card as well. Hang on a second... I don't go inside to format the PC it's all done while the PC is turned on and since he is ""not good with computers"" why would he want me to remove a vital component of which he will struggle to put back in without breaking it as he is so incompetent?

I have offered to get him a replaced or repaired graphic card as it is still under warranty but he is not having it. He is blaming me for my poor packaging (styrofoam around PC and monitors with plastic air cushioned bubbles and empty boxes to keep everything tight and secure) that it is the reason why it broke LOL. So I've told him I don't want to talk to him any more because I believe he is harassing me as well as lying to me on how it broke. He has now opened a return case and I have told him I'm not going to accept a refund unless he accepts a replacement or repair from the manufacturer as it is still under warranty.

Also I would like to mention the graphic card and power supply unit are dusty in the pictures I provided on the listing. He has provided a picture of the graphic card and power supply and to me personally it looks like he has attempted to clean it as it looks a lot cleaner.

So what are my options here? I have offered to get him a replacement/repair but he does not want that. I also stated that this PC could not be returned on the listing. I am more then willing to give him a refund as long as the the PC comes back in the condition I sent it and the packaging it came with. As the graphic card ""doesn't work now"" (I've had no visual evidence of this btw) and because of how its been treated I personally feel I should offer him a partial refund and get the broken parts replaced (motherboard and graphic card), but I don't know if he has purposely destroyed anything else and will have to wait for it to come to me and test the parts. Another thing is he never showed me any damage on the packaging and I do not want to ask anymore because I feel he will attempt to create some damaging on the box to get away with it.

This person is not tech savvy, has been rude from the very beginning calls me childish for not showing any sympathy for his children, wanted me to deliver or him to pick up the PC without tracking information, as well as calling me a lier and unqualified to fix PCs because I couldn't remove a graphic card for him which he did not state he wanted at all. Personally I do not want to talk to him anymore because I believe he and I will not come to a solution and I have said this to him in a message and we are hoping to get this sorted out through eBay customer service.

Ebay,"Looking for guidance, buyer wants to change. .....","Hey all. I recently sold 15 large lots of collectable action figures.  Due to the number and nature of the lots I prepackaged the lots into 15 x 11 x 10 boxes and set the shipping to actual cost. I stated in the listing that I would not combine shipping. Of course someone from Oregon won 3 lots ( I'm on the East Coast ) and sent me a message complaining about the $60 shipping.  I responded that the shipping was clearly stated. They responded that large flat rate boxes (which are 12 x 12 x 5) are only 17.90 and could I combine the 3 lots into 2 boxes. I considered this and responded that to accomplish that I would have to remove all protective packaging. The buyer said that would be fine, but I don't feel good about it. My inclination is to tell the buyer this isn't acceptable and move on, offering 2nd chance offers. 

Would the trail of messages and the buyer's consent release me from liability should the items become damaged during shipping? Is it ok for me to tell the buyer so long and offer 2nd chances?",7,3,2015-10-20,EBAY,0.07789620012044907,0.8887385129928589,0.03336532786488533

Ebay,"Buyer paid. I can directly click paypal transaction, but it's not in my feed. seen this before?","Hi All,

I have sold nearly 1,000 things on eBay w/ Paypal, and I haven't seen this issue before... A buyer (with a feedback score of 174, member since 2008) purchased a videogame from me. My paypal balance shows that I got the money. However, the transaction isn't in my paypal activity feed, even if I filter down to all transactions and only the date that it was received. However, If I use the drop-down box on eBay to view the paypal transaction, it shows up just like a normal transaction, and the buyer's address is listed as verified. I contacted PayPal about this around 36 hours, and despite their automated system telling me I'd receive a response within 24 hours, i haven't heard back.

At first, my instinct was to not yet ship... and I haven't yet... but now I'm thinking it's just a PayPal glitch as the buyer has good feedback, a verified address, and the money is in my account. I just don't to want to get screwed somehow...

Ebay,Does the Android ebay app actually work for you?,"EDIT- I FIXED IT! SEE BELOW!

I know this sounds like a dumb question but I'm trying to figure out whether the new app actually works or if it's just my phone. I've reinstalled a couple times now to no avail. 

My problem is that messages and item descriptions simply don't scroll. When I open a message, can see the top half but I cannot scroll the page to read further.  It's the same for item descriptions. I can see some of the description but I cannot scroll to anything further down. I've checked this on my own listings as well as other people's listings.

Is it just me? Do you have any problems accessing messages and descriptions?

If this is the new standard and not just a bug, then I'm going to have to shorten the info on all my listings! That actually may be a good thing since I probably am writing too much as it is.

Thank you for any help.

EDIT- OK I fixed it. Whew! I saw on the eBay forums that other people have had this problem. EBay said that screen dimming apps can break webviews and that is why things don't scroll. I do have a screen dimming app but deleting it didn't solve the issue. So I checked other apps I have that may work ""on top"" of eBay.

Now I just get dozens of messages from people saying they want to buy it and that they need my PayPal email to send the money and will pay extra and a bunch of other crap trying to trick me.

Then they will say it was an accident but will still pay the full price if I do not want to lower it (they really are desperate). I am getting so frustrated and don't know how to get around this.

Ebay,Was I being scammed? Selling a motorcycle..,"I'm trying to sell my motorcycle on eBay and I feel like I'm being scammed.  We're set to meet in the morning, but I'm just going to blow it off..it doesn't feel right.

 - Buyer with 2 feedback buys my motorcycle with a fairly bogus seeming username.  Joined 5 days ago - October 15th.  Leaves me positive feedback within a few hours.
 - Almost immediately he says he can't make a deposit via PayPal (I honestly don't care if we dealt in person quickly) and to call/text him if that's an issue.
 - Says his PayPal account doesn't work because he previously had a credit card on it that got stolen...can't make deposit and to call/text.
 - I end up texting him, no response..then I message him on eBay with my number and I get a response back from a very similar number (a 6 vs. a 9) and the sale continues..  I just thought one of us messed it up.
 - It seems like the person texting and the eBay messages from there on out were different / out of sync (one saying he'd come by today, after we'd already decided morning was best).
 - The person texting says there's an issue with his eBay account and he can't access it and he doesn't know who that is...  ""That wasnt me at all"" ""I can't even get into my account right now""
 - In general, the writing style and grammar of the eBay messenger seems sketchy, but the person texting was fairly decent.

What was the end game?  Buying the bike with counterfeit bills or outright trying to rob me?  Realistically if anyone responded to my ad on craigslist none of these red flags would've come up, so the eBay angle is just really confusing to me..

Ebay,Things I've learned in 15 1/2 years of using eBay...,"* **Remember, ebay is skewed toward the buyer. As a seller you need to be extraordinarily careful.**

* People who tell you that your shipping prices are ""unreasonable"" and cite one or more examples of items they've sold as ""proof"" of this will inevitably be problematic buyers. Don't reply to their messages, [block them from bidding](http://offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?BidderBlockLogin), and move on.

* As a seller, even though you might be *technically* right in a given dispute, it's usually not worth the effort to argue the point. As a buyer you have the ability to affect the seller through refunds (including return shipping) and negative feedback. As a seller you have the ability to affect the buyer...in absolutely no way whatsoever. Consider the potential outcome for any given dispute; is it worth the return shipping cost to avoid the aggravation of an irrationally pissed off buyer and negative feedback?

* Never sell anything outside of your home country.

* Never ship anything to any address other than their registered/verified eBay/PayPal address.

* Never communicate outside of eBay's messaging system.

* Anyone who bids more than fair market value is either trying to scam you or using a shill account to overbid your item so that people will overlook it and bid on his (similar or identical) item. Cancel their bid, [block them from bidding](http://offer.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?BidderBlockLogin), and move on.

* Everything you sell should have multiple pictures. Not only does this help your sale, but it also protects you against false claims. And make sure your description matches the pictures; use the phrase ""see photo"" after describing a specific issue with your item (scratch, blemish, etc).

* Any bidder who created their account within the past few days is likely a scammer or shill. The likelihood of this is directly proportional to how desirable your item is. (Selling a used poncho? Probably not a scammer or shill. Selling an unlocked iPhone? Yeah...)

* Handle anyone with &lt;10 feedback with *extreme* skepticism. Don't immediately assume they're a scammer, but *do* assume that they have no idea what they're doing.

* Insure everything you ship for the full value of the item.

* If you're offering local pickup, arrange to meet at a police station between you and your buyer's location. Show up early, go to the desk and tell the officer why you're there. Accept cash only; no in-advance PayPal payments (otherwise buyer can claim an ""item not received"" since you can't provide a tracking number). Use your cell phone camera to video record the transaction.

* If you're doing a Buy It Now sale, enable ""immediate payment required"" — especially if you have a desirable item.

* If you're selling something that you've modified, make it CRYSTAL CLEAR in your listing exactly what the mods are and how it affects the item. Want to sell a PS3 that's now running Linux? Great. Make sure everyone knows exactly what the PS3 can and cannot do, and how it differs from a stock PS3.

* If you're selling clothes, take measurements of EVERY PART of each item. The sleeves are &lt;x&gt; long, the collar is &lt;x&gt; circumference, the legs are &lt;x&gt; long at the inseam, etc. Relying on the manufacturer's sizing info, particularly in the case of women's clothing, is a nightmare. You *will* get returns.

**EDIT: For those calling out ""bad advice"" let me remind you of the subject of this post is ""things that *I* learned"". Everyone else's experiences will vary. When 100% of my out-of-country purchases go wrong, I apply that experience to my future sales. If your experience is different then naturally you'll have different rules. These are *my* rules.**",59,35,2015-10-22,EBAY,0.06099029257893562,0.9121544361114502,0.026855237782001495

Up until this year, life as an ebay seller has been pretty easy. We never had to do any marketing or promotions, because we sell new tools, and tools sell. But sales dropped, so we started panicking. We decided that it was time to create a marketing plan for our store. We hired a ebay consultant and hired a marketing guy. We called ebay many times, and learned all the things we were doing wrong.    

&amp;nbsp;

Over the last six months, we have 'fixed' 16,000 listings. We have added item specifics, edited pictures, changed categories, changed search terms, created a new store platform, edited titles, and basically done everything recommended by ebay for peak performance. We started an instagram, twitter, and pinterest account to create marketing buzz. We started doing promotional flyers and sales. We've hit up tool websites and messaging boards, and subreddits and facebook pages. We've done it all, and more.    

&amp;nbsp;

This morning, sales were lower than ever.    

&amp;nbsp;

So, I decided to check out how we come up in ebay's search. I typed in 'carbide inserts' into ebay's search engine. We have 3,000 carbide inserts listed on ebay. There are 83,000 carbide inserts total on ebay. I'm not great at math, but I think that means 1 in 27 carbide inserts listings are ours on ebay. By that math, I think we should show up on the first 200 listings when searching for 'carbide inserts.' We don't. We don't show up on the second page of 200 listings either. We have one listing that comes up on the third page of 200 listings. In addition, one seller has seven listings in the first ten listings that come up when searching 'carbide inserts.' This seller has slightly lower ratings than us, no item specifics for his listings, and low-quality pictures.    

&amp;nbsp;

I called ebay, because I'm frustrated. I said all of what I have just wrote, and the customer service rep said there is nothing else for us to do to improve. We've done it all. We have incredible standing with ebay, we offer everything to our customers that we can, and we have edited our listings for prime optimization. But we aren't coming up in the beginning of the searches. I asked the rep, ""Have we pissed off ebay, or something?"" He said no. Of course.

&amp;nbsp;

So, /r/ebay, what am I doing wrong? Why am I not coming up in the first 500 listings from an ebay search? I've searched other terms, other brands we have, we don't come up. Can anyone offer some help as to what I might do next to save our business? 

&amp;nbsp;

Ebay,New Ebayer Shipping Question: Combining Shipping,"Hi r/ebay,


A buyer just bought 2 of my items (2 shirts) from two different auctions.

2 - Or can I ship them together in one box and provide the same tracking number for both items?

Ebay,Sketchy seller after having won the auction and paid,"Yesterday, I won an auction for a set of Jeep Grand Cherokee wheels and tires. The price was really good, and local pickup was available. Once I won the auction, I subsequently paid via PayPal and selected local pickup (hat may have been a mistake).

I then messaged the seller asking what their address was so I could go pick them up, and things got sketchy fast. He responding saying he'd like to avoid having to pay fees and would like the money in cash, and I could ""check out the wheels and tires""...even though I already bought them. I told him I already paid via paypal and would like an address where to pick them up, and he responded an hour later telling me that he was now going to charge $540 (instead of the $380 I won them for) because otherwise he was losing money.

Now this obviously is a load of BS, I'm not going to do business with someone who pulls this crap, so I contacted ebay and let them know what was going on. They could see his message history and agreed it was sketchy, but told me to contact PayPal as there was nothing ebay could do immediately.

This was late last night, so instead of trying to call Paypal, I instead message the seller and immediately ask for a refund in full, then started a PayPal dispute.

And that is where I currently sit. It's now been nearly 12 hours since and I have not heard from the seller or seen a refund. I'm tempted to file a claim with PayPal with the info I have (the ebay rep said they have all messages on file and would provide them all to PayPal).

Ebay,Canceled deal and voided shipping. Refunded buyer full amount. Now buyer won't accept item cancel notice and paypal just withdrew the entire sales and shipping price from my bank account - please help,"Sold an item on ebay for $300 plus $60 shipping (heavy).  Buyer paid via paypal.  I printed a shipping label, packaged item, scheduled a pickup. 

Buyer notifies me he wants it sent to a different address.  I said sorry, can't do that, can only ship to verified address.  He says he will update ebay, but nothing I can do at this point.  I cancel the scheduled pickup, I refund the buyer his full amount, and send an item cancelation notice - reason being there is a problem with buyers address.  

Buyer says he has confirmed it with ebay, but on my end it says still waiting for buyer to confirm.  He wants me to relist the item even though I don't have the cancelation notice.  I tell him I do not want to do that. 

So paypal refunds the full amount and even though I voided the shipping label through ebay I have to wait 21 days to get the money back for the shipping (says pending review or something).  So that happens yesterday.  

Today PayPal debits the full auction amount from my checking account tied to my paypal account.  But here is the thing...I had never transfered the money out of Paypal to my bank or any other format.  Literally guy paid, told me his problem, I refunded the next day. 

can anyone help me figure out what exactly is going on?  I called my bank and they said they can't help me at all.  Lovely, right?  I've been in contact with the buyer and he keeps saying he will sort it out with ebay and he wants the item, but I'm starting to not feel the love, so to speak.  Is he lying when he says he accepted the item cancel notice?  It has been over 36 hours since I refunded and sent the item cancel notice.  

Is there some possible way I am being scammed?  

This may be the deal that seals it for me and no more ebay.  I get screwed constantly when I buy and now get screwed on almost every time I sell something.  It's the buyers fault yet I'm the one with money tied up and getting sucked out of my bank account.  I don't even want to relist the item; I'd rather torch it at this point.

Ebay,Ebay refunds buyer without having the buyer return item.,"Long story but will keep it concise.

Late September: Buyer emails me constantly about wanting to buy a $200 item. He has to wait for his SSI payment in early October. I tell him he can bid when he gets the money.

Oct 2. He places a lower bid and I accept it. $165. Ship product.

Oct 8. He claims item has a very small defect and that he paid too much. I offer a partial refund. He says ok. 

Oct 14 He opens a return request. I ok that. I send a prepaid label. He doesn't use it.

 Oct 20 He has ebay place the case on hold requesting full refund. Case is escalated.

 Oct 20-24 I talk to 4 different ebay CSR's trying to get case closed. All can see the offers to accept the return in the messaging system. None will close the case in my favor on the phone. All 4 imply I will win the case. I am not as optimistic. I sense trouble ahead.

 Oct 25, Ebay closes case in buyers favor. No product returned plus buyer gets all his money back.

 So here I am out $175 (includes shipping) plus my item which is actually more like a $250 item. I just have had it with idiotic ebay and the scammers. I have sold here since 2002 and bought since 1997.

 Like many. My ebay days are done. I will clean up the few auctions I have left. Delete my watch history and of course, not buy here anymore. Do they get that? My accounts are small to medium. I pay $250 in fees a month on average and spend about $200 per month.

Ebay,Hundreds of views on this one specific item. How weird! Why?,"For the past few weeks I've been listing a few things (computer stuff). One of the things I listed was a portable hard drive from Other World Computing. Most of the other things I listed were getting a nominal but reasonable amount of views — anywhere from 17 to 48. But for some reason the OWC hard drive got nearly 400 views. It ultimately didn't sell, so I knocked $10 off the price and relisted it. Two days later and the relisted item already has 150 views, while my other items have between 5-20 views.

I had listed another portable hard drive (an Iomega) at the same time as the OWC. The Iomega got a ""normal"" amount of views before it was purchased with BIN.

Ebay,eBay customer service came through this morning!,"As a lot of us sellers know, getting through to customer service this week has been rough.  As a result, I had three big ol' issues to tackle this morning:

1 - Neutral feedback left because ""I didn't see that returns weren't accepted until after I purchased the item, so I'm not going to leave positive feedback.""  Huh?

2 - Neutral feedback - ""I bought the case for the G3 Vigor but thought it was for the G3.  Seller won't take return.""  Um, yeah.  That's why I don't accept returns.

3 - Return (my favorite) - Buyer messages me yesterday afternoon with a sob story about her husband being in the hospital so she was just able to try her case out today.  She states that as she was fitting it onto the waterproof tester (it's a Lifeproof) that a piece just ""fell out of the side of the case"".  The picture she sends CLEARLY shows she snapped off a piece of the case somehow (I've installed hundreds of these cases on phones in person - never managed to do this myself).  When I explain that we follow eBay's Item Condition Policy for Returns and I cannot return an item she stated she broke, she opens a return stating that the item was damaged during shipping.

The customer service rep researched each and quickly agreed to remove both feedbacks and open an escalation case and approve it for us.  NO issues.  NO arguing.  I know I probably got a good rep, but I really wanted to post this for the newer sellers that have heard nothing but bad about the system.  I can almost always get things resolved in my favor because I'm overly careful about following the rules, BUT it also seems to me that in the past month or so, eBay has really been trying to tip the balance closer to center instead of ALWAYS favoring the buyer.

Ebay,Seller suddenly added money to shipping cost after auction won,"I won a fairly low dollar item at the very top end of my bid, shipping was quoted at $4. *Immediately* after the auction ends the seller sends me an invoice which has shipping for $12. I asked him why and he said ""materials"", which to me is obvious BS. 

The item did sell below the expected end price based on prior sales, I believe the seller is trying to recoup part of that cost by screwing me out of extra shipping. 

Obviously if I just don't pay he has a ""non-paying bidder"" which which to report to ebay. What is my recourse before that happens? I don't see any options on the invoice page which would seem to help me or open any case with ebay.

The seller has all but refused to ship at the quoted price, even though I said I would be willing to accept a slower shipping speed if it helped him ship at the actual listed cost. If the original shipping had been listed at that price, no way I would have bid on it because it's an obvious case of ""excessive shipping"", and if I did bid my bid would have been $8 lower. 

EDIT: And there is no mention in the description of increased shipping cost needed for this item for any reason, it's very small and on average costs about $3 to ship. Not that putting an increased shipping amount in the description would be ok from an ebay point of view anyway

Ebay,"Buyer Pays a Week Late - I Ship Immidiately to Minamize Delays - Buyer Leaves Negative Feedback and non-reciept Disput Because, Gift Card was Not Emailed to Them.","I've been on eBay since 2005. I sold a $50 Amazon Giftcard. Unforuntately, this buyer never shows up so I second chance offer it to a few of the other bidders, and shipped it off to them. At first I had the physical item in hand and offered on the orginal listening to email as well as physically ship the card.

However, when this buyer shows up over a week late and makes payment, I don't think too much about it and ship a giftcard with 1day delievery directly via Amazon.com.

Well, a day later the buyer asks for the code via email. I tell them that due to the circumstances and lack of response to my first message that it should be at their paypal address tomorrow &amp; not to worry.

They get very upset, and leave negative feedback. 

I tried to protest it with Ebay simply explaining their own giftcard policy and the circumstances. They weren't having it because the listing said ""would email and ship phsyically."" Okay. Great. Not fantastic, but I can handle negative feedback, I'm a big girl.

What's getting me now is this user has messaged me more than onece asking me to leave them positive feedback and upon refusing to do so they have filed a non-reciept case, despite having tracking that proves the item has arrived.

IDK what to do ... something tells me I'm screwed out of $50.

Ebay,Dispute with customer regarding missing item.,"Hello fellow eBayers

I sold an item and shipped it to the confirmed PayPal address. Tracking shows delivery on Oct 6th.

Claim opened customer on Oct 23rd claiming he never received the package, we have been going back and forth since then. He informs me that he lives in Ecuador and that address is the one he uses for all packages. I received another message from him today that that address in not correct. 

Mind you all these exchanges are logged via the dispute messages. He wants me to ship out another radio. I advised him that's not gong to happen till USPS makes a final decision on the claim. 

Any help or advise helps",11,1,2015-10-30,EBAY,0.05605112761259079,0.8947885036468506,0.04916033893823624

Ebay,Is this a common scam? Feels so weird to scam this way.,"So I sold a sealed electronic item, worth about $100.  The day after the buyer gets it, she e mail my actual e mail address to tell me the item doesn't work - that she's tried toubleshooting the item, but it won't turn on.  She states that she would rather have the original receipt and get the item fixed than sending it back.  She has 0 feedback by the way.  

After several back and forth polite e mails, sometimes several times a day - I explain that I have bought several of these items, and would not be able to give her the receipt, because all the other items are in the same receipt.  I told her I would open one of the sealed items to see if it is working.  I open up one of the sealed items, and of course it's working.    

I hate that I have to give in to her, but I write to her to go ahead and send the item back to me, and that I would give her a full refund, and to send me the tracking number once she's sent it.  It's been almost a whole week now, she hasn't written back to me to say she's sent the item.  I don't get it, was she saying the item doesn't work just so she could get a receipt from me?",11,11,2015-10-31,EBAY,0.048013173043727875,0.9120208024978638,0.039965949952602386
Ebay,Buyer from my blocked country list got through. Huh?,"So I'm in the US.  I block sales to United Kingdom.  My blocked country list has clearly prevented any sales there in over 3 years...I stopped because I received way too many complaints about VAT taxes and shipping cost, was personally blamed for it, and their country has these weird no cost return entitlement nonsense rules.  I don't need sales badly enough to participate in this, so I don't.

Ebay,Ebay Sellers: What is the '1000 Free Listing' Message from Ebay?,"Hi r/ebay


At the bottom of the ""Sell' tab there is something that says along the line of 'Click the Activate Now Button and you will receive 1000 free listing.' And the message is from Ebay. 


Are there any catch or strings attached to this offer? 


Or is it as simple as clicking the button and you have more free listings?


Thanks",5,3,2015-10-31,EBAY,0.024549385532736778,0.9420766830444336,0.0333738699555397
Ebay,"Parcel never arrived, what should I do?","On the 2nd of October my mother ordered a power supply for £40 (roughly $60 US) from Ebay. The seller wasn't an individual seller but in fact Argos, meaning they'd sent the parcel through their own delivery service - which from past experiences with argos delivery, I can safely say was a mistake.

After a couple of weeks the parcel had not yet arrived, so I suggested to her that she send a message explaining this. The seller then replied saying that it had in fact been delivered, yet we could not find the parcel anywhere in our garden or porch. So we waited, thinking it was just sent to the wrong address and the neighbours would eventually hand it to us. On the 23rd, we opened a case with Ebay.

The case was then put on hold till the 24th, but my mother recieved a reply on the 29th saying that a final decision had been made and that they could not refund us because the parcel had been delivered. This, of course, is not true - or at least we cannot find it. The only way we can appeal is to have 'Written proof from the courier showing the actual address the item was delivered to.'

We're not sure how to get this evidence. How can we *prove* it was not delivered here, and show that we didn't receive it? £40 is a big loss to us and my mother doesn't have a lot of trust in online shopping as it is let alone if she loses £40. Is there any way we can solve this?",7,3,2015-10-31,EBAY,0.04737824574112892,0.9103826284408569,0.042239099740982056

Ebay,Is this a weird thing to do?,"Whenever I buy something for £50 +, I always bring out my camera and record the opening. So if there is any problems  (example - It's broken, not as described, not even there.) I have proof that it arrived that way and I didn't tamper with it.

Anyone else do this or am I just weird?",10,2,2015-10-31,EBAY,0.07013493776321411,0.8854117393493652,0.04445331171154976
Ebay,"New shopper on eBay, have question about shipping policies.","So, I ordered and paid for an unlocked cell phone eBay. One of the main selling points was that it offered free ""same day"" shipping. My phone is smashed so I am without phone until this one shows up.  I ordered it on Thursday, and now it is after business hours on Friday. 

I did receive a ""shipping notification"", but when I looked at the actual USPS tracking, I saw that it was only to have created a label and has not actually been seen by the USPS. If they manage to get it in to the USPS tomorrow (Saturday) since it is now after hours Friday that means it has actually been two day shipping (three if you go from the day I ordered it) Although the shipping was free, I paid the extra fee for priority mail.

So since they sent me the tracking number the next day (label was created), am I being unreasonable in expecting it to be actually shipped already? Does sending a tracking number but having it still sitting at the sellers place actually count as being shipped per eBay policy? I don't want to leave a bad rating if I am being unreasonable, so therefore I turn to you /r/Ebay  to help me understand proper etiquette on eBay. 

**TL;DR**: Bought an unlocked cell phone on eBay from a seller offering same day shipping. Two days later all they have done is create a label. Is this typical for eBay? Am I being unreasonable in expecting the item to have actually shipped the same day?

**Edit** to mention that I had paid up front.
**Edit** It came two days early. Thanks for the input!",8,1,2015-10-31,EBAY,0.03839153051376343,0.9072506427764893,0.05435783043503761
Ebay,eBay GSP buyer wants refund 90+ days after purchase,"So I sold some memory this July, it went abroad using the GSP. 

On October 14th, I receive this email.

I received an item that wasn't as described: BUYER sent a message about Kingston 1GB (2x 512 MB) KTD-DM600 RAMBUS RAM Memory Dell RDRAM #221805442824

&gt; Hi just noticed that these 2 ram sticks are not 2 x 512MB in fact they are 2 x 256MB ,it says 512 on both of them but i have just run BELARC ADVISOR and its saying they are 256 MB so can i send them back and have a refund.
&gt; Thank you in advance 

This was sent October 14th, the item was sold on July 15th. 91/92 days in between. The email looks like an eBay form email, but I did not see any item not as described cases in the resolution center. I also did not receive an email from eBay about an INAD case being opened against me. Because of these reasons, I have questions about the legitimacy of this request. 

Based on some advice that I received, I did not respond to this email. 

He sent the same text in another email a week later, on the 21st. This email did not have the INAD form associated with it, it looked like a normal ebay email. The next couple emails also are not in the eBay official INAD form. 

On the 23rd, he sent this email
&gt; item number xxx Kingston 1GB RAM.
&gt; These sticks are not 512s they are 256s .please forward a returns address so i can send these back to you and get a refund.

He sent this email this morning:
&gt; 
&gt; Item not as described ,was advertised as 2 x 512s and they are only 2 x 256s
&gt; i would like a refund A.S.A.P.as i paid for 2 x 512s memory sticks
&gt; 

So what should I do in a situation like this. He is way past any return period and it is too late for him to open a case. I cannot refund him with eBay, as it is too late for that, so I don't want to give him money through Paypal and have it not show up in eBay's system. 

I also have a ton of inventory that I would like to list on eBay, so I'd like to avoid selling limits. 

What would you do here?",8,1,2015-10-31,EBAY,0.05557817220687866,0.9163143038749695,0.028107579797506332
