Ebay,So I saw a dozen baking racks for $6...,"Market price for this item is $24 - what a deal! I order 2 other items to save on shipping.

The ~15000 positive feedback seller marked the order as shipped on eBay and then two days later issued a refund for the baking racks through paypal without communicating through eBay. As such I wasn't aware of this change to my order until I received the items.

Ebay,What to do with this seller?,"I purchased a laptop keyboard from a seller in China. It arrived but has a hardware issue. I contacted the seller and after following their troubleshooting steps they agree with me.

They said they can send me a new unit. However they said, ""And okay, we will resend you a replacement keyboard. But as you know now is Spring Festival holiday season in China, so the delivery time will be much longer than last time, hope you will understanding.""

This is only through messages and given I haven't dealt with this issue before it seems to me that this should be done through ebay somehow? Is this normal or am I having a fast one pulled on me?

Thank you!

Edit: Here are the results of this. I spoke to them many times but they wanted me to cancel the return so they could send me a new keyboard. They said it was ""against their company policy"" to keep returns opened long. I told them ebay doesn't care what their company policy is, and there's a money back guarantee, but that didn't sway them. I told them the closest reason to cancel a return was ""I returned a replacement item,"" which I hadn't yet, and they stopped writing me after that.

On paypal my only options are ""provide shipping info"", or ""issue refund""... so I guess I'm issuing a refund.

Watch for those zero feedback buyers...

She said I would need to work it out with the seller and have them file a claim because there is insurance on the package. 

I asked what would happen if they filed the claim, got the refund, but then didn't refund me and kept the money instead. Her response was, ""oh no, I think the seller will refund you."" I asked what if they didn't, then I would have no recourse? She basically said no because they wouldn't be able to refund me since now my issue is with the post office and no longer with eBay....

Ebay,How to deal with creepy messages from other users?,"Hey! First time post on here - I've had this issue before and just wanted some advice on the best thing to do in this situation. 

I'm a private seller and currently getting rid of loads of my nicer clothes on Ebay to help fund a trip abroad. I have great feedback and have been an on-off seller for years with no similar issues, but the last few months I keep getting numerous creepy messages from other users regarding (new with tags) bras and underwear bundles I'm selling. 

Usually these messages are along the lines of ""hey will you model this for me ;)"" or ""I'd love to see a pic of you wearing this xo"". I keep my listings as straightforward and professional as possible, no photos of me wearing any of the clothes, just the product photographed on a plain background with simple size/material/colour/style listed and nothing more, &amp; my username isn't connected to my social media at all. I could be anyone..I don't get it?! 

Last time I received one of these messages I was in the mood to troll them, so I put the bra on my head/kneecap/elbow etc to photograph until the person got annoyed and stopped messaging me. Now they're just getting annoying and there doesn't seem to be any way to report users, so they can seemingly just get away with it. Some of my hairier male friends volunteered to send photos of them wearing the bra, which was very nice of them, but I shouldn't have to resort to that to stop receiving these kinds of messages.

Any advice on what to do besides blocking the user? Is there definitely no way to report completely inappropriate messages, as surely they'll just think it's okay to do if it goes unpunished? And anything I can add to my listings to deter these kind of messages in the first place?

Ebay,Seller wrongfully opened claim against me. How do I make sure they don't get a refund?,"TITLE SHOULD SAY BUYER (NOT SELLER)

Hi all,

I've been a seller on eBay for 6 years now and have luckily never had any dissatisfied customers (with over 1,000 sales).

A new ebayer (5 feedback) recently opened a case against me claiming that my listing and title for an item (a set of vinyl decals) were misleading/deceptive and demanded a full refund claiming they were 'ripped off.' I politely went back and forth asking them what they mean etc. and it turns out they just didn't read the listing/title of the item. I politely told them I would accept their return and refund them less the original shipping (if they also paid to ship it back). I don't have my listing set to accept returns but was going to out of kindness. They continued to say I need to pay their return shipping, I'm ripping them off, etc. then left my first negative feedback. Now I don't see any point in accepting their return, as I have sold 180 sets of these same decals with rave reviews and already have negative feedback from them.

My question is: the claim is still open and I refuse to accept a return from this person. What do I need to do to make sure it doesn't automatically close and give them a refund?",5,3,2017-02-02,EBAY,0.07814603298902512,0.8824188709259033,0.039435118436813354

I called ebay shortly after posting the question above. The rep said it would come down to the buyer's wording in the feedback. If he stated the item was defective, the feedback would stand.

If he stated the feedback was left because of not paying the return shipping, it could be removed.

As expected, he left negative today. Incidentally, the comment was a mixture of both, so I had little confidence in getting it removed.

Imagine my surprise when the eBay rep completely agreed with me and removed it without any hassle or resistance whatsoever. He said part of his agreement with me is that the buyer didn't open an official case. He just messaged me for the return and I agreed to it.

Just wanted some advice. I sold a film camera on Ebay, in full working condition as described when i packed and shipped. Even told buyer to read manual for it before using it etc. They received it (this is back in early December).

A couple weeks later they said they couldn't get it to work. I troubleshooted and still nothing, said that i would accept return at the time if sent back. They waited a little while and then said they took it to camera shop to see what needs to be fixed and would keep me updated.

A month and a half later, they message me saying camera shop got back to them and couldn't find out what was wrong with it.

Ebay,eBay sided with the buyer. Buyer returned a completely different item.,"So not sure if anyone remembers my issue from a while back, but eBay ended up siding with the buyer, which is really no surprise. The buyer sent back an item, but didn't even send back the item he took pictures of for his ""proof"" of me sending him the wrong item. The buyer sent something completely different and damaged on top of that. I contacted eBay and it sounded like they were going to refund me the money they took from my account. Are they actually going to send me the money or am I going to have to keep calling them? Anyone run into a situation like this?

I did take pictures and video of me opening the box because i had a strong feeling he would do that. If he was smart he would have just sent the item he used in the pictures, but apparently he isn't that smart.

Ebay,"So an auction of mine finishes, then the buyer says that they will only pay if shipping is free, or they want me to register the item?","I'll start by saying that I've sold at least a couple of hundred items on eBay some years ago for my father under his account, and I've just started selling things under my own account recently to make a bit of money on the side.

So yesterday an auction ended for a smartwatch that I had listed, and the buyer messaged me with the above response in the topic title.  Now I've never heard of registering an item on eBay in the past, and was wondering if this was something new, or if the buyer is just trying to weasel their way out of purchasing the item.  I responded back to them by asking them what they had meant by registering the item, and my response was then met with them wanting to cancel their order.  After biting my tongue, and wanting to tell them off, I decided to just keep my cool, and agree to their request.  I'm still technically a new seller on eBay, and thus I have a restriction of a 10 item/$500 a month limit.  I also realize that I need to be on my best behaviour to have this limit removed.  What made me even more infuriated was the fact that when I went to send a second chance offer to the next highest bidder, I was cut off due to already being over my limit from other items that were currently still up for auction.  Suffice to say, I'm not too impressed right now, and I will be phoning eBay shortly to tell them about my situation.

Ebay,"Buyer requests refund almost 3 months after purchasing guitar, what would you do?","So, I sold a guitar to a buyer in Australia. It was not my first time doing this, as I've sold more than a few guitars/amps on eBay and always had a positive experience (even on overseas transactions). This time around not so much.

After first receiving the guitar the buyer emailed me saying he's content but started nitpicking small things about the used guitar (No plastic backplate which most guitar players remove to allow ease of use of tremelo, it's $6 for a replacement) and not original Tremelo bar which was how I received it and never said it was original in the listing.

So fast forward 2 months and he comes back emailing me with personal threats and insults saying I'm a lying whore because the pickups were not what I said. The pickups were EMGs and I thought they were a specific model and they turned out being a different model that look EXACTLY the same. I had no clue as I only owned the guitar for a few months and never opened it up. 

I responded in a professional manner saying I had no idea they were the other version and I apologized. I offered to send him money to replace the pickups and didn't hear from him for a month.

So now a few days ago he came back and again passive aggressively threatened my seller credibility and asked to send the pickups or else he will take things further with PayPal.

What would you do? In all fairness, the pickups on the guitar are pretty much the same price and value, they're just not the ones in the listing. Should I take the high road and send him a partial refund for the pickups even though the refund policy date is expired? Or should I let him take it further with PayPal (which has a 180 day refund policy) and possibly have to refund the guitar with the risk of it being damaged after almost 4 months of it being on the other side of the world?

Because he requested the return after eBays policy (60 days I believe?) I was able to dismiss the request after the first threatening email and him not replying for a month.",15,3,2017-02-06,EBAY,0.09872855991125107,0.8678927421569824,0.03337867185473442

Ebay,[help requested] Ebay presale: avoiding scam (international buy),"Hello dear folks of /r/ebay. I request to you to help me with my case and what chances I have about avoiding scam for an presale item:

(the story:)
So, I have bought an presale-item, furthermore a videogame (no auction) on Feb. 2nd (this month) via interntional shipping (as im living in germany, seller lives in the US) and payed with paypal - the listing is ending on March the 3rd, 12:25:56 MEZ./ March 2nd for US). After I have realised I went into an potential scam I went to search for ways of solving the problem, eventually contacting the seller for a refund on Feb. 4th 19:34 (german time)* to call for a return. It ended up with literally no progress.(I got him to say that he would ship the item on march the 3rd if it does help[which might not be very helpful as he already stated so in the description])

I'd like of you redditers now what I could do from now on if I was to be scammed (the seller had 532stars and 100%positive feedback - even on limited editions like I was buying, so I went into deal without even noticing what trap I may have run into) and how I could even turn get my money back - in other words I'd like to know a guide of how I should behave and like I already stated how to get my money back eventually.

Ebay,Seller claiming package returned?,"Hello there /r/ebay! I play a lot of the MtG trading card game and order a lot of cards off eBay. A few weeks ago I bought one that was supposed to have arrived more than 10 days ago. I messeged the seller, and we agreed to wait a few more days in case the mail got lost.

What's strange is that it's the same address I've used for all my eBay orders (well over 10) in this last month, and I haven't had a single problem at all. The card I ordered also spiked in price in the secondary market since I ordered it, and despite it being a relatively low value card, it increased by almost twice the price. 

He offered to give me a refund because he couldn't get the packaged sent due to this address issue. I've asked him to talk directly to the Post Office about the issue and for him to continue trying.

She never includes batteries and it raises the price and is corrosive if left for long periods unused which happened before so no batteries.  

The listing don't list batteries. 
 Everything is listed and photographed.
There are no claims that the watch has a battery though all watches are professionally serviced and working.

The issue is ...

the buyer claimed the watch was broken. 
Then when we asked if they had put a battery in it, they refused and became irate and testy.

She explained that she isn't a battery seller and these are vintage watches which sit in storage for decades.   She doesn't know own what battery type.
She didnt mention she already lost money on the watch which is lovely and had sentimental value (she's selling everything).

This has never been an issue before with other watches she has sold.
Also it didn't come with a battery when it was new.

They refuse to pay the apparent £5 -10 for a battery and won't state if the watch is broken as they won't test it.  
They blame her for their work schedule being to full to have time to buy batteries lol
They are very blamey.

They've asked for money for batteries and an engineer and for a return and now threatening to let eBay decide.

She'd accept it back if its tested first but by not testing it's all just suspicious.
We worry they'll send it back broken.

They believe they were mis sold the watch, as it should have a battery but we didn't list one and they didn't ask and the description said everything seen here and never claimed it was running but it was tested.

Question:

Any idea if the buyer can make eBay refund it from the seller for these reasons?

And if it comes back damaged what does she do? As this person seems spiteful. 

Please help as she is a lovely lady and very stressed.",39,3,2017-02-08,EBAY,0.051344819366931915,0.9152759313583374,0.033379312604665756
Ebay,Seller Fee Help,"I CANNOT for the life of me get a straight answer out of Ebay. Ebay says to ask collections, collections says to ask Ebay and I'm about ready to just storm off on both of them.

Ebay says they sent it to collections and therefor they cannot set up a payment plan for me to keep it out of my credit and to talk to collections. Upon calling collections they told me ebay needs to set up the payment plan themselves to avoid it from hitting my credit report.

Ebay,Advice for ebay noob when buyer requesting a refund,"I sold a laptop keyboard (with an international keyboard layout). About a week later the seller has requested a refund, in poor English they demanded a refund or replacement claiming the item is faulty.

I tested the keyboard just before sending and it worked. I've sent them a message to clarify what the problem is but have not heard anything.

I've just checked and this buyer is from a new account with 0 feedback.

I think they are a scammer. They could easily damage the keyboard and return, or send a faulty one back.

Ebay,A couple of questions,"I sold an item on Friday.  I hadn't received payment for it by Tuesday afternoon.  I opened a case and the buyer paid last night with an e-check.

Second question.  I have several items up for sale and I have a potential buyer who sent me a message with an offer.  I countered and he said he would think about it.  Eventually he said he would buy it.  I changed the total and then he changed his mind.  He sent me probably 50 messages in about 60 hours all about my auctions.  The messages started to get bizarre like he said he was going to buy the items and shoot them with a BB gun.  Various other messages like that.  I thought I blocked him, but apparently I didn't.

Ebay,"Seller has a ""no refund"" policy","Hello. I bought antivirus software from a seller. The seller then sent me a license code. When I entered the license code on the website, I was given an error code saying the license is region locked and cannot be activated. I have sent the seller a message about the issue but I noticed he has a ""no refunds"" policy. I would have never purchased this software had I known it was for a specific region. I think it sucks that the seller doesn't have a disclaimer notifying buyers that thier product only works in specific regions. Also, the item listed for sale does not have the region it can be activated listed. I am hoping eBays guarantee refund policy overrides the seller.

Ebay,INR - am I going to lose this?,"Buyer ordered item ($40) Jan 28th.

Item shipped USPS First Class Package on the next business day and shows delivered Feb 1 (in the city, state and zip on the order). 

Buyer opens INR Feb 6th. 

I call eBay, provide tracking and case closes Feb 7th. 
Later that day- buyer tells me that she will go to PO to investigate.
 
Buyer messages me today (Feb 8) that the package was forwarded and that she ""needs my help"". I looked at tracking info (screenshot included) and now there is a new scan dated Feb 8 @~12p saying ""Forwarded"".

I am pretty sure that I have lost seller protection here, even though I shipped to address on file, since the package was ""redirected"". I am unclear on this. The ""forward"" scan shows up a week after delivery (to the city, state and zip on the order). 

By the way - She called me ""dear"" :)

Can she re-open or appeal the eBay case now?
Will I lose if/when it goes to Paypal?
How can I defend this?

Ebay,Weird messages off ebay buyer,"I started selling my laptop on eBay yesterday and received a message from a buyer who had placed a bid offering to buy the item and would like to make an offer. 


When I rejected the offer stating I would like to leave the item to auction he said thank you, that he didn't even really want the item anyway because it was out of date spec anyway but he would 'do me a favour' by placing a bid to bump up to going price for other bidders. 

This seems a bit sketchy to me, and I advised him that if he didn't really want the item then he shouldn't bid. but he did anyway and now he's the leading bidder with a bid of £102 and automatic bids that will go up to god knows what. How should I deal with this?

Ebay,Buyer claiming INAD; uploaded pics identical to mine. Now opened return request. Worth fighting?,"I'm a new seller (only 22 reviews) and have had great comments so far. I listed a pair of kid's shoes and and took best offer (half of list price).  
Seller messaged the morning after receiving them and stated that ""the item had more wear than I would have thought"" and asked for a full refund of the purchase price and initial shipping, plus pay for return shipping.  I said I don't do returns but would be willing to refund the initial amount, she would have to pay for shipping.  Within the hour I received a return request and am now supposed to pay for return shipping as well.
She took pics of her own, which show the same exact things that mine did in the posting.  She also has a massive amt of negatives/INAD reviews that she's left for buyers - within the first 25 alone there are 9 that mention some version of ""not as described"" or what she expected, and 2 that she claimed arrived broken.
The shipping is 2x the cost of the shoes (item was only $3); I want to escalate it as this woman is obviously abusing the system completely, but it sounds like it never falls in the sellers favor.

Ebay,Original eBayer back selling after a 7 year break. Here are some observations and a few things that have happened in the last 90 days back --,"Well after my first go at it with eBay from 98-10 or so, I am back starting pretty much from the ground up.   My first eBay seller account had almost 5000 feedback.   When my first marriage ended, so did that account.  Over that amount of time I went from part-time seller to full-time.   During a couple of years I did over $100K worth of business.  I worked 20 hours a day back then..WHEW... It was fun for sure...Oh and my feedback was at 100% .  I had MAYBE  8-10 negatives and a few neutrals.  

So fast-forward to now.   New marriage, new wife, new account, new start!!!   I've went to starting doing a little here and there to selling full-time again....Not by choice, but it can be viewed as an opportunity ( I was hired for an awesome retire-from type of job late last year --- A school system for their already bloated IT department only to be a budget cut two weeks before passing probation) .   Over the last 90 days we've had almost 20K in sales and almost 200 transactions.   Business has been decent and steady, and climbing.   We went from all money being held in Paypal to all money available.   We are now Top Rated Plus.

Here are a few things :

The amount of scams is dramatically higher now vs. then.    I've had about 10 transactions that I've had to immediately refund.   These are the ones that the buyer will send you a message within minutes of purchasing something and asking you to change only the State, City, and Zip.  ""Oh I got it wrong, can you change please"" ....  These are hacked accounts.   I guess they can change the street address without triggering anything, but not the second address line --  I always refund, relist, and never hear anything again.   

Buyers abuse the "" Item did not work "" reason to return/refund.   I've had 7 returns and only 2 of those items were actually returned defective ---

2 items were hard drives.  Both buyers had ""HDD"" in their buyer name and shipped to same address.  Both opened SNADs .  Lost both since they never sent anything back nor did they respond to my messages.  Very good chance a competitor - Both accounts had feedback private.  It was our first hard drives we put up for sale and I'm sure it was a ""warning"" - Yes I blocked them and have the address memorized for future sales.. VERY uncool...

*3* items returned worked PERFECT after retesting ....

We received our first negative recently.   A buyer claimed the part we sold him destroyed 2 parts in his computer.   Not only did he not take us up on our offer of a full refund with a return and we  pay for return postage, he rattled off almost $200 worth of parts he said were destroyed.   I offered a return, he again refused, he stated again the price of the parts he wanted us to pay, my wife responded again that we weren't paying and she signed her name.   When he replied he called us *ssholes and said something like "" Oh cute you sign your name blank"" .... ""I hope you get *ucked *n*lly with a cactus"" and a few other choice words...

He followed up by a nice fat negative to which we replied with simple facts.   We called eBay for the extortion attempt and the language and sexual assault wish on my wife..   OF COURSE they won't remove the negative because gee he never came out and said "" If you don't pay me the extra money I will leave you a negative"" ...  And they promise to email him a ""stern"" warning on language.   Oh and the last five transactions he's left feedback for were 1 positive and 4 negatives, with other sellers commenting about abuse and demands....  eBay GROW A BRAIN - GET RID OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS.   

The amount of people that leave feedback is MUCH lower now vs. then.   I don't know if it's because we are a small seller or times are changing and people don't leave feedback like they use to.   I'd use to get feedback for about 75% of people.  Now it's about half that....  And no I don't have many customer issues that would leave people on the fence.   

Both Paypal and eBay websites are much better now vs. then.   They are faster, cleaner, and listing is pretty darn easy now.

Calling eBay and getting the ""drones"" is the worst.  I mean THE worst.

Ebay,Issue with Buyer,"I mistakingly messed up with 2 simultaneous orders by mixing up the shipping labels, I always double check but for some reason I double checked wrong, twice. Anyways Buyer #1 contacts me letting me know he received the wrong item,  all while Buyer #2 had yet to receive the wrong item as of yet so I contacted him informing him of the mixup. Instead of printing return labels back to me as it would cost more, let alone take more time to ship them back to me and then back out to them, I decided to just have them ship to each other in which they were both cool with. 

I purchased the shipping labels with each of their addresses on them and emailed them over for them to print up. A couple days pass and neither have shipped them out as of yet. I contacted Buyer #1 to see what’s going on to which after a couple of back and forth messages over a couple of days led to him essentially holding the package for ransom as hostage in fear of him never getting his item and getting screwed with having to fight with ebay to get his money back. While that is understandable as it shows that the package was delivered and no way for ebay to know whether he received the wrong item or not. I assured him that regardless if it ever comes to that but assured him that it wouldn’t as he would get his item that just in case if not that I would fully refund him and mentioned that he now has written proof for ebay with our messages that I said that I would refund him just for extra assurance. None the less, he insisted on shipping it out as soon as he saw the tracking info update for his item. I didn’t argue with him any further at that point as I just essentially told him that I didn’t care for his attitude so I said some things along the line of to act more professional/mature stop being so childish by holding someone else’s item for ransom. All while noting that I have a positive feedback of over 700+ while he has over 4000+ as he runs an ebay store so I figured there shouldn’t be any trust issues considering each others feedback. Regardless, I offered to put him into direct communication with Buyer #2 if he wanted but he didn’t seem to care or at all interested.

A couple more days pass and neither have still shipped them out so I contact Buyer #2 for an update who has been far more understanding of the entire situation than Buyer #1, but this time I took to facebook for an immediate response only to find out out he had been really sick and unable to drop it off at the post office and said he would the next day. I gave an update to the Buyer #1 letting him know to check the tracking in a day or so and why it hadn't been shipped yet. Buyer #2 stayed true to his word and ships it out, the tracking updates all of while I have been communicating all the details and everything on a daily basis with Buyer #1 in an attempt to keep him informed. Well I can only assume by this point Buyer #1 grew tiresome, weary, and skeptical after so many days of back and forth communication of not seeing the tracking update as well as being hurt by my words of being told to handle the situation maturely by not holding someone else’s belonging for ransom stopped replying to my updates in which he decides at this point he’s going to rep me with inaccurate and negative feedback stating “switched up items” which essentially alludes to as if it were intentional instead of him saying “accidentally mixed up my order” or something along the lines of that at least, after I’ve done everything in my power to rectify the situation, none the less I don’t feel it was worth the negative, but at least a neutral for any inconvenience it may have caused. So he decided he would crucify me for being human and making an honest mistake not only by doing that, but also keeping Buyer #2’s item even after seeing the updated tracking information that Buyer #2 shipped his item and has now listed Buyer #2’s higher priced item for sale in his store!!! All while Buyer #2 has been cool as a cucumber, with great patience and understanding. Regardless of trying to do everything in my power to rectify the situation, I finally received a last message from Buyer #1 two days after his decision to leave me negative feedback and after Buyer #2 shipped his item saying that as far as he’s concerned the transaction is done with and any further attempts to contact him I will be blocked. 

So quick review, he's repped with negative feedback, essentially blocked me and decided to keep Buyer #2’s higher priced item as well as his actual correct item that is currently in the mail enroute to him screwing me and Buyer #2. So now he’s basically screwed me out of money for Buyer #2’s item as well as postage cost for a 2nd label and most importantly screwed Buyer #2 over who has been so honest and understanding of the situation but even more was the fact that he was stealing from a child as the item was meant for Buyer #2's son. But what is even more frustrating is that ebay doesn’t allow buyers to leave negative feedback back as it is only allows positive which is complete and utter bullshit. Since he blocked me on ebay I have since attempted to contact him via his phone number to no response as well as 2 other associated emails of his and his facebook to no avail. So now I’ve had to communicate with Buyer #2 about the situation and have been left with no other choice but to refund him his money. 

TL;DR mixed up packages to 2 different buyers, Buyer #1 decided to keep Buyer #2's package and sell it in his store while Buyer #2 shipped Buyer #1 his item. So Buyer #1 now has 2 items and has written misleading negative feedback which I can’t counter with leaving him negative feedback for being a thief leaving me to refund Buyer #2 now.",3,1,2017-02-11,EBAY,0.1676883064210415,0.8043851852416992,0.027926499024033546
Ebay,Bought a phone from eBay. May have been scammed.,"I bought a phone from ebay. The seller listed it as an insurance replacement from the phone's carrier. I received the phone and everything worked fine. I check the imei on the carrier's website and it shows that it has an unpaid balance. I immediately contact the seller. The seller tell's me they paid off the phone's original balance, but forgot to pay off the balance on the new phone. The seller promised to pay off the phone as soon as possible. We go back and forth in messages on ebay and the sellers assures me they will pay it off. A month later and the seller still hasn't paid it off. The other day I go to the phone's carrier store and they tell me, that if the phone was originally paid off the insurance replacement, would not have a balance. I thought ebay gave 180 days return protection, but when I check the option to return the phone it just says its beyond the return limit and it may not be covered by ebays return protection. I still started a return request and sent the seller a message through ebay's resolution center. I paid with Amex credit card. What is the best option now? Should I call ebay or my credit company? Or am I screwed?",6,10,2017-02-12,EBAY,0.0384131483733654,0.932192862033844,0.029394006356596947
Ebay,People who edit eBay item descriptions with HTML. What is your technique?,"Hey guys, so I decided to fancy up some of my eBay auctions, and the eBay html editor is god awful.  So I went into sublime text editor to arrange all my html in a manageable view, got everything looking good, organized, and working.  Then I go to paste my text back into the eBay html text editor box, and BAM I just get one simple line of code, and nothing I wrote out translated back into the text box.  I tried pasting the info into a text document and then pasting it into the ebay window from there, and still nothing.

It seems to me that eBay really doesn't like spaces between lines of code, which anyone who codes or knows that is a nightmare.  So on top of tab not allowing me to indent within the eBay html text window, I also can't paste in anything with indention to make it legible for me while editing.

Does anyone have a solution for this, or any other programs that work well for doing html with eBay?  Thanks guys.

&gt;*EDIT:  Turns out I'm a dufus and was using the wrong window.  But, after further experimenting, it turns out that still can't paste directly from Sublime text editor,  don't think eBay likes all the indentations that make it easy to read while coding.  Perhaps Microsoft Word is the way to go here.

&gt;Also thought I would throw in a little tool I found while doing some description editing and brushing up on my HTML;  [This web page](https://html-cleaner.com/) allows you to convert anything you have pasted into word, into html script.  Pretty cool!  Seems to have some more features for other scripting languages as well, but this is a really good tool to learn with as well, in case you forgot how to make a table or something like that.  Also, [this webpage has a nice Hex color wheel](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) tool to figure out your hex code for a specific color you are looking for.

Ebay,I think I'm being scammed,"I'm fairly new to eBay and made a post here a few weeks ago asking for guidance after I received an offer for a product I had put up months ago which had long-since expired from auction.

Long story short, I recieved an email this morning saying part of the product had broken off and, since the part wasn't in the box, I must have decieved him and knowingly sent a broken item. The email included pictures of the broken product although I'm not entirely convinced it's the same one I sent. The email also included a link to a spare part worth roughly 1/4 of the price he paid, and he has asked me for a partial refund.

Ebay,"Buyer is requesting a refund, stating PKMN game is fake. Advice?","So I not too long ago sold a Pokemon Platinum game I bought off of Ebay from a US seller some months ago. I had no problems with it and it looked completely fine to me. My Nintendo 3DS recognized the cartridge and appeared to have no issues.

The buyer has contacted me today requesting a full refund stating the game is a fake and nothing more. I have never encountered this before and I didn't realize that fake pokemon games were an issue on the site.

Is there anyway to figure out for sure that the game I sold ended up being a fake? I am concerned that the buyer is trying to scam me and don't want to deal with any shenanigans. I took pictures of both the front and the back of the cartridge:

Any help/good advice is appreciated. Thank you.

UPDATE:
I've contacted the buyer and the buyer explained that the front sticker code doesn't match up with the first four letters on the back of the cartridge. The letters on the back of the cartridge start with ""APAE"" and the front sticker middle code is ""CPUE"".

Edit: Created a small imgur album to explain the issue with the codes: http://imgur.com/a/mEpdx

I located a verified authentic copy and saw that this indeed was the case where a legit copy would have it's code match up. It's amazing how good this fake copy was. Unfortunately, it means I have lost out on a sale. I accepted the buyer's return and will issue them a refund.

Ebay,Complete Beginners Guide to Ebay,"*I originally posted this on /flipping and have been expanding it as best I can.*

*Perhaps some people will find it helpful here.*

Wrote this to help friends/family that were interested in starting on Ebay. I tried to make it as simple as possible without total information overload. There are a bunch of different ways/methods to do things and I know mine may not be the best way every single time. 

That said I'm sure that some of you may have constructive feedback which is welcome.

**Ebay Complete Beginners Guide**

First step you need a Paypal.

While there are different ways to receive or send payment, 
Paypal remains the safest and most trusted option on Ebay. 
You can actually lose sales by not accepting Paypal.


**-Paypal sign up-**
Strongly advise having a bank account to send money into 
from Paypal.

This could be either a personal account if you are small
time and only selling a few things around the house every
once in a while OR if you are big time it would be your 
""Business"" account. 

What I mean by that is that this
bank account would NOT be used for ANYTHING except business. 
Why? Because if you are doing this full time,
this will limit your problems when doing taxes. Also it
will provide you with a much clearer picture of where you
stand with your business.

(Paypal is limited in what you can purchase in-person, unless
you decide to get a Paypal debit card, thus having a bank 
account to send money to from Paypal is important.)


Tax information. I do not advise on tax information, consult
a tax expert.


**-Sign up to Ebay-**
For convenience I use the same email signing up to Ebay as I
use with my Paypal account.
You do not need some amazing name to start with. It is very
easy to make a new Ebay account and you can have as many
Ebay accounts as you want linked to 1 Paypal account.

HOWEVER if your Ebay account gets suspended or banned, they 
will also suspend or ban your other accounts linked to your
Paypal.

**-Link your Ebay &amp; Paypal together-**
Log in to your eBay account.
Click My eBay at the top of the page.
Mouse over the Account tab, then click the PayPal Account link.
Click the Link My PayPal Account button. You will be asked to 
log in to PayPal to finish linking your accounts.


You should now have an account where you can either buy or 
sell things. Yay for you.


**Selling Limits**
First time sellers have a very low limit on both quantity
of items they can have up as well as the total value of 
those items listed. 

I believe beginner limits are ""You can list 10 items with a total
amount of $1000"". 

As you sell items they will automatically
increases your selling limits, however you can request
higher selling limits, once a month.

To see your Monthly selling limits, click ""My Ebay"" at
the top right. Scroll down, on the left click on ""Sell"" and it should
expand. Click on ""All Selling"". 

You can also see the amount of
free listings you have. Ebay automatically gives you 50 free
listings every month. If you list after using up your free
listings for that month, they will charge you a small fee.

At the bottom of the same page you can also see the promotional 
offers that Ebay has available for you. They will add new
ones every once in a while. These offers can help you save
money on selling fees and allow you to list more items for 
free.
This is a very important page and you should be checking it
anytime that you are going to relist items. Promotional
offers will not necessarily be the same across all of your 
Ebay accounts. To activate any offer just click ""Get Offer"".


**Pictures**
*Preferably use a digital camera. Could use phone/tablet 
that can take decent pictures but you may end up spending
more time that way*

Easily worth 1000 words each, you should be taking pictures
from all angles. Make sure you have good lighting and also
take pictures of any defects or problems. Your item should
be centered in the middle. In some cases where size is hard
for a buyer to judge, you should include something to scale
like a quarter or a ruler. Pictures are the first thing a 
buyer will see, so always upload good quality photos. After
taking pictures of the items you wish to list, spend some
time editing through the photos. 

Generally, I will make a 
folder for each of the items I took pictures of. Put all
of the pictures for each item to its corresponding folder.
Go through each folder and delete all of the bad pictures.
You should have a max of 12 pictures for any 1 listing.
You can have more pictures, however Ebay will charge you
extra if you go over 12 pictures. In some cases, especially
for high value items like cars/boats - it pays off to include
extra pictures.




**Listing an item**
If you are signed into your account, click ""Sell"" on the top
right. Type what you are selling into the box, and 
click ""Get Started"". 

**Category**
Based off of what you put in the box,
Ebay will show you a selection of categories that they
believe your listing would fall under. Usually your category
should be shown, but if you do not see it, search through
""Browse categories"".
Click at least 1 category. You can click up to 2 in an effort
to reach more buyers, however you will be charged extra 
money.

**Title**
This is your headline. Make sure your item is 
easily searchable with the correct wording.

**Condition**
Click and it should give you some options. Unless your item is 
""Brand new"" you will have a Condition Description box to describe
about any defects. Input any problems you have noted, as well as
where they can be seen in your pictures. This both explains
honestly to the buyer what to expect, as well as protects you
in case of fraudulent buyer activity.

**Add Photos**
Click and add your photos that you have already saved to your
computer. Make sure your first photo is your best photo as that
is going to be the first one any potential buyer will see.

**Details**
Describe your item.
Many buyers are reading impaired so even if it is redundant
I will include the same information twice.
A general example of what I write in this section is:

Name of Item

Manufacturer, Year Made

Any Defects

Anything interesting about the item.

Returns Policy. 

**Format and Price**
You can choose between Auction or Fixed price.
Generally speaking you will want to have your item listed as
Fixed price with the Best Offer option checked.

If you do not know what to price your item for, you can check
what others are selling for by searching the item on Ebay, and 
on the left under Show only, click ""Sold Listings"".
Make sure you factor in the 10%Ebay + 2.9% &amp; 30 cents Paypal fees.
As well as what your shipping is going to cost you if you are 
offering the buyer ""free"" shipping.

**Quantity**
This should be left as 1 unless you have multiples of the same
exact item in the same exact condition.

**Duration**
30 days is the longest choice which is another reason you will
want to be using Fixed Price listings. Auction listings do not
have as long a duration.

**Select how you'll be paid**
Make sure PayPal is checked, with your correct corresponding
Email address.

**Shipping**
There is no one correct way to do shipping. But this way should
give you the most leeway as a new seller.
U.S. shipping Flat: Same Cost to all buyers.
You can add in different shipping services with different times
however for simplicity choose Economy Shipping which gives you
the longest timeframe in case a package takes a while to get 
there.

Cost 0. Whatever you are charging for shipping should already
be added into the price of what you are charging.
And for Handling Time choose 2 business days. By doing this, you
should never need to rush to the post office in case something
sells. There is a downside as you will read below about 
powersellers.

More about shipping at this [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/5ris24/beginners_guide_to_cheapest_shipping/)

**Return Policy**
Make sure your returns policy is set up how you want it. 
I will also add a description of my returns policy in the details
section of any listing I make. Most of my items I accept returns
on - with the buyer paying return shipping. However for some
heavy and or big ticket items I will not accept returns and I 
will state this.

**Shipping/Handling &amp; Powersellers discount**
If you are doing this as a business and can 

""Have a minimum of 100 transactions and $3,000 in sales with US 
buyers over the past 12 months""

and 

""Maintain a positive Feedback of 98% or higher over the 
past 12 months""

and

""1 business day handling time""

and 

""a 30 day return or refund policy""

You can qualify for being a powerseller which has various 
benefits such as the 20% off Ebay final value fees.

*You sell an item and Ebay would normally charge 10% of your
your items value. So lets say you sell a $100 item, and normally
are charged $10 final value fee by Ebay, they would instead 
charge you $8 with the powerseller discount. This can add up
for those doing a large amount of business on Ebay.* 

**Sold**
If you sell an item you should receive an email notification.
You can also check your Ebay and Paypal account, to make
sure.
Paypal will hold the money until after a certain amount of time
has passed that the buyer has received the item. The amount of
time that those funds are held, will decrease for sellers
with a good reputation. 
Ebay is not going to take its 10% cut of the sale immediately, so 
make sure you do not simply withdraw or spend all of the money
in your paypal. Leave some money to pay ebay within 30 days
as well as pay for future online transactions or shipping.

**50 Free Listings Every Month**
Ayyyy why is Ebay charging me? I thought this was free. It is free
to list. Ebay will still charge you if you sell an item though. After
you use your 50 free listings you can wait till the beginning of
the next month and get another 50 or you can keep listing
more items however you will be charged .30cents for each 
new listing. Should you? It depends on how fast your items
sells. Quick sells are usually fine, but no one wants to list slow
selling items repeatedly at a cost.

**6 Free Vehicle Listings a Year**
Vehicle listings are different from your regular listings. You only 
get the 6 free a year AND if you use all 6 you will not get any
more ever.  So basically only use 5 of your 6 free listings.

Oh that's cool it only costs 30 cents to list. WRONG.
Vehicle listings cost 50$ to list after you use all of your free
listings. Do not ever use your last free vehicle listing.
You can get more free vehicle listings by just making another
account. But it is a pain to sell when you have no feedback.

**Shipping an item**
Make sure you have a box on hand that fits what you are selling.
If you are using priority shipping you can get flat-rate boxes for free
from your local Post Office however that is only* for the priority
shipping method labeled on the box. There is Priority Small, Medium, 
Large, and Envelopes, as well as regional boxes available for free. 

Also you can ship regular (NOT flatrate) priority using any regular box 
so long as its not a priority flat rate box. 

You can get free shipping supplies
at basically any store by asking the manager if they have any
boxes/packing material they were going to throw out.

Anything breakable should be secure and unable
to move around in the box.

**Paying for Shipping at the Post office**
You can pay for shipping at the post office however it will cost you
more money than other methods. Once you have paid and received
your receipt the employee should have circled your tracking number.
If they did not, and you are unsure of tracking numbers, ask the
employee to explain it to you. Then go home, log on Ebay, click
""My Ebay"" in the top right. Scroll down click ""Sold"" on the left.
The item you shipped should be shown here. Click ""More actions""
and then click the option to upload tracking. Type in the tracking
numbers you have on your receipt from the Post office.

**Printing out a label Online**
If you are paying for shipping via Ebay, at the top right click on
""My Ebay"" scroll down to Sell and click on Sold. Your item should
be shown here. Click the ""more actions"" and click on print label.
You will be shown a variety of shipping options. You will need a 
scale to weigh your item. Make sure you enter the correct weight 
for your item or the post office could reject it. For simplicity,
the options you should be checking are ""Parcel Select"" and 
""Priority Mail"" for anything over 16 oz. At or under 16 oz should 
be ""First Class Mail"". Choose whatever is cheapest so long as you
entered the correct weight for your item. (If your item is super
bulky or oddly shaped it may not apply, so you should double check)

You also have the option to add insurance for your item, which is
a good idea if you are shipping an expensive item.

**Discounts**
There are a variety of ways to get shipping discounts. For example
you can get money off by printing out your label online. You can
do this via Ebay which saves you the hassle of inputting your tracking number to confirm that you shipped the item.

**Feedback**
Having high feedback is important. When you first make your account you should buy a few things. Whatever it is you were going to buy anyways in the near future. People will leave you feedback, which will help your new account look better than one with 0 feedback.

**Ebay Store**
As a beginner you should absolutely not get a Ebay store. 

However if you plan on doing serious selling in the future on Ebay you should at least know enough about it to find out if it is right for you.

As of right now Ebay has 3 tiers of stores - Basic, Premium, and Anchor, with 2 different payment subscription plans - Monthly or Yearly.

Basic $24.95 per month or $19.95 per month with yearly

Premium $74.95 per month or $59.95 per month with yearly

Anchor $349.95 per month or $299.95 per month with yearly

Okay, why in the world would I want to pay this much money?

You will receive lower final value fees when you sell an item.

More free listings at the start of every month.

The ability to put your items/store in ""vacation mode"" which lets buyers know that you are out of town and anything they buy will not be shipped until whatever date you say you will be back in town.

For regular non store sellers if you are making more listings than you have free listings, Ebay will charge you a 0.30 cent fee for your new listing. However depending on which tier store you pay for, with the Ebay store this insertion fee is reduced to 0.25c 0.10c or 0.05c for fixed price listings. 

Auction listings are 0.25c 0.15c 0.10c.

**This below, I believe is true, because that is what I see when I search through listings, but I cannot substantiate it - so take it however you want with a grain of salt. It may just be Ebay store sellers having higher feedback &amp; sales, faster selling items, less stale listings.**

Ebay will prefer Ebay store items in their search algorithm over a regular non Ebay store seller. So if you and another seller had the exact same item and all things being equal except that they had a store and you did not, their item would appear first in a buyers search results.

Ebay,Buyer changes shipping address to international after purchase?,"Let me preface by saying I'm a newcomer to eBay. Im not full time, and I've only been at it for about 2 weeks and sold 17 listings for just over $600. 

This has happened twice to me in the last week. First, a woman bought a pair of jeans and asked them to be shipped to Canada instead of FL. I emailed her saying that the price of shipping will be higher, since eBay calculated it to ship only to FL, not internationally. She ranted and vented when I sent her an invoice for $4.00 to cover the cost... and I cancelled her sale to avoid the hassle. It was a headache. 

Someone else just purchased a heavy cardigan. Their address is in Kentucky, but it was a reference number and looked jumbled. I contacted the buyer and asked her to clarify the address - she gave me an address in Canada. Again, eBay charged her a lower rate because the sweater was supposed to be shipped within the US. I also like to buy insurance when I'm shipping internationally (to avoid the tracking # scam).  I'm about to
Message her and provide an invoice via PayPal for the remainder due.

I'm a bit frustrated with this practice. Has anyone else dealt with this issue?  How did you resolve it? Is there a way to keep this from happening in the future?",6,8,2017-02-14,EBAY,0.06641539186239243,0.9019555449485779,0.03162900730967522

I typically cancel the purchase, do a full refund and then I block them so they can't try and pull another scam on me later.

It seems like I should ship the items out, right? Can someone please help?

Ebay,Laptop I sold damaged during shipping. I had ShipCover for the entire amount sold. Should I have the seller return the laptop before or after I file a claim?,"I sold a laptop for $550 and bought ShipCover when I printed out the shipping label. I took photos immediately before sending the laptop (EXIF date stamped if that matters). 

The laptop was placed in foam wrapping and then wrapped multiple times in bubblewrap and also had airbag packaging around any loose room in the package. I would've bet I packaged it so well I could've sent 100 eggs across the country without breaking.

In any case, the buyer is claiming the laptop screen was damaged in shipping and now the computer is bluescreening repeatedly. He sent me detailed pictures and said it came out of the box like that. While I'm skeptical to believe that the damage was caused in shipping rather by him, I can only go by what he says.

I'm trying to make sure I don't shoot myself in the foot with issuing a return and filing a claim. Right now he requested a refund through ebay saying the item wasn't received as described and sent several pictures of the damage. 

I guess my questions are, are there any gotcha's I should be aware of moving forward? Should I go ahead and process the return before I hear back from ShipCover?

Ebay,Sold an item photographed next to original packaging.

My buyer failed to request it and now demands refund.,"3 total similar items were all photographed and listed this way, and 1 single buyer bid and won all 3. He admits that he did not request packaging, claims it was ""fine print"" and misleading even though the descriptions were extremely brief 3-4 lines and HALF the description was regarding the packaging. I pay for Expedited Shipping and full insurance, did not want additional expense of sending original boxes if not necessary. He has halted both eBay and PayPal. Before making this listing, I researched myself if there was any eBay policy stating all photographed items must be included in the shipment and made the description very clear and concise. The statement explaining that the original boxes must be requested by the buyer was included in the original listing and not added at a later date.

Did I violate some eBay rule? Photo from the listing and screenshot of the description included, with info identifying the item blurred to prevent buyer from being identified himself. 

I offered to send this packaging, although I'm not sure if I still have it for all 3 items. I don't really want to send them at my expense but I guess I wild if I had to, and I fear a chargeback and losing both the items and the payment if these boxes aren't still astound my house somewhere.

Ebay,eBay is frustrating me lately,"I need to vent. 

eBay is a wonderful platform for buying and selling but is hindering honest folk with many dishonest buyers and sellers. 

I buy many items from eBay. I have never had to do a return in my life. Everything works flawlessly. 

I have sold for a long time. Model cars and electronics. I get scammed left and right and eBay backs you up zero percent. 

I sold a model car for $200. I actually sold three. 2/3 made it to their destination fine and I received positive feedback. They were all new in box, as I have owned them from the store and have never opened them. The third one made it to the buyer. Then a week passes and the buyer opens a not as described case. 

I hate these not as described cases. I've lost $100's from electronics on this. I've stopped selling electronics on eBay. I thought model cars would be a tight community but apparently not. Someone has nothing better to do then to take you out $50 at a time. 

Anyways. This guy states that the item wasn't new and that I used something abrasive to clean it and scratched it up. Well his message was horribly misspelled. 

I initially stated provide pictures of the damage. If item is still in box I'll do a return. No response. A week of no response and I get an email he opened a case and not ten minutes later eBay rules in his favor. 

Now who knows if he's sending me back his damaged model or an empty box. It sucks people are so down on their lives they have to ruin yours when you're just trying to provide goods. 

I think this is my final straw for selling. Until eBay fixes their buyer is always right policy. I am out. Or if any of you have thoughts?",11,6,2017-02-15,EBAY,0.07683275640010834,0.8921768665313721,0.030990390107035637

Sold a SNES on ebay recently, all was working well and no issues or damage. 

Got a return request, saying the item is not as described as the bottom is cracked. Now it is possible the item was damaged in transit, but of course I'm wary I could be getting back a different console.

As it stands, I've asked the buyer to send me pictures of the damage including the serial number (I have the S/N to compare if it's the same one)

They haven't responded yet, but I'm worried about just letting it go.

Should I accept the return and put the onus on them to return the item, or should I wait until ebay has to step in, as they would see they haven't responded to my requests.

Ebay,Can we talk about eBay's Late Shipment Policies?,"Lately my local post office has been doing a great job of scanning in my packages however occasionally some packages won't be scanned in until they arrive near the buyers hometown which can be 1-2 days after I ship the item (this is because I don't want to wait in line at the post office and have every package scanned in, it's a waste of time in my opinion so I just drop the packages off there).

 but it didnt ship till the 10th. and it doesnt have any tracking? it wont get tracked until it reached the usps in my city i guess? its being weird. so today is the 16th, still no word on the package. i cant even tell where its coming from cause his location just says (built in the usa). im starting to feel a little scammed off thinking that it would get here by the 11-14th considering i bought one as soon as he made the listing, then this shady tracking business .

Ebay,Thinking about starting an eBay customer support service - any advice?,"I've been selling on eBay for a while now, and I noticed that a lot of my eBay seller friends have customer support problems similar to mine, even though they sell vastly different types of items. They also generally spend a lot of time and mental energy on customer support.

I figured there's gotta be a way to streamline this stuff a bit, so having a technical background, I built some basic tools (Shippo integration, some stats/reporting on the types of cases coming in, etc.) and offered to solve my friends' support cases for them for a fee.

They're pretty happy with it so far, and I'm thinking about potentially scaling up the operation and doing this for more people (which would justify building more tools). I'm wondering if you guys think this kind of service makes sense, and if so, what the particular pain points you'd like to see handled.

Ebay,PSA: Issues with return labels,"I just had a very frustrating experience. Let me try to explain what happened without venting.

Buyer asked for return.

I authorized the return and bought a label through ebay

I got an email the next day saying ""update your return address""

My zip code had a typo on it, and I was missing a phone number.

I updated the address

Next day got another email that my return address needed to be updated

Got a message that a money back guarantee case had been opened and if I didn't facilitate shipping in 5 days the buyer would get the money back and keep the item.

I called ebay. It turns out:

When the buyer attempted to print the return label, ebay detected that the address was wrong and would not give him a label

But two return labels for the same return can not be generated

So I had to buy a label outside ebay. Attach a screenshot of that label to the return case and notify the buyer to use that label.

There are a lot of issues here. But here's my primary concern:

If Ebay could detect that the return address was incorrect. Why was this check not done before I purchased the label? Why is the check done only when it's too late to correct the address for that return?",8,4,2017-02-17,EBAY,0.11011997610330582,0.8659278154373169,0.023952187970280647

Ebay,"Blocked Buyer bought item on new account, now causing issues","A few days ago I had a buyer ask to purchase an item of clothing directly via Paypal for a fraction of the list price. I do auctions and offers however this item's price was non-negotiable, so I ignored the message. After then being asked a couple nitpicking questions which I ignored as well, I checked this buyers' feedback left for others and noted several negatives left, I added this buyer to my block list right away.

The next morning I notice that exact item had sold to a brand new user in the same state with the same first letter in the username, asking the same questions.

I politely answered all questions and despite my suspicions, I mailed the item next morning. The buyer received the item in a couple of days. Same day of arrival the buyer messaged that they're 'very disappointed' and went on to mention several flaws they have noticed such as slight yellowing and loose strings from the stitching. Buyer expressed interest in keeping the item if only there was 'something we could do?' (this is likely fishing for a partial refund as I ignored the request for an off-site discount)

Without responding I called eBay and they confirmed both accounts were indeed linked and that they would ""take action"". They also let me know I was within my rights to either take the return or to decline it without fear of receiving negative feedback or losing an appeal, due to the buyer's policy violation.
I messaged back the buyer that due to circumventing my block list, there wouldn't be any action I would be taking. This morning I receive a return request under item not as described, plus an angry message from the buyer, under the impression that I have to accept it. 

According to eBay that is not the case and I'd rather not chance receiving an item back from an angry buyer.
I was thinking of calling eBay, explaining the situation and declining the request while on the phone with them. You guys have been great in the past, I was wondering if anyone has been in this situation or has some pertinent advice for me.

Ebay,Buyer wants to return item 28 days after sale which had 14 day return policy. What should I do?,"TL;DR: Sold an item. Had a 14 day return policy. 28 days later, buyer wants to return it claiming missing parts and pieces. What should I do?

I sold an item on January 13th via Buy It Now. The buyer paid on January 18th (after I opened an Unpaid Item case since it was an expensive item $1000+). I shipped it on January 19th. It was delivered and signed for on January 21st.

I have a two week (14 days) return policy on the item. It has been 28 days since then. Got an email this morning saying it was missing a piece (everything in the listing was included) and that it was the wrong version (it was not). 

I have been selling on eBay since 1999 and have 100% positive feedback. (I only sell a few things every year and do it just to get rid of old things).

Do I have to accept this return even though it has been more than 14 days since the item arrived? Will eBay / PayPal side with the buyer since it says missing parts or pieces? Wouldn't 14 days be enough for the user to determine if it is missing parts or pieces?

I don't want to accept this return, but if I have to I will. What would you do? What do you suggest I should do?

Ebay,Does eBay fault me for not uploading a tracking number?,"I'm Canadian and ship via Canada Post as it is the only post office accessible to me where I live. I usually will ship tracked, as parcels shipped within Canada are always tracked and it only adds a few extra dollars to get tracking with a shipment to the US.

I always add 5 different shipment options to my listings - Canada Post regular parcel for domestic shipments, tracked and untracked for shipments to the US, as well as tracked and untracked international. International tracked costs 40, for obvious reasons. No one wants to pay that, so my shipments always go untracked if that's the case.

Ebay,"Sold an item, buyer wanted a return saying the item doesn't function and returns item with what I believe to be something other than what I shipped","Hi r/ebay,

I shipped a fitness tracking device to a buyer after receiving payment, which was brand new and functioned perfectly before I shipped it (I had tested it).

Buyer received the device, and immediately requested a return saying it won't charge or turn on, fullstop. Barring it getting damaged in transit (which cosmetically, neither package nor device indicate such) or having been done in by cold temperature, I believe the buyer's return request to be unreasonable and their behaviour potentially fraudulent/dishonest.

Furthermore, what I believe to be the real issue here is, it seems to me that the original device I shipped has been swapped out of the wristband and replaced by an identical, dysfunctional product. I made the mistake of not noting the serial number before I shipped it, however the device returned to me fits loosely into the wristband, which raised an immediate red flag to me.

What are my options? I have only gone as far as having paid for the product's return shipping to me, and I have contacted ebay about the buyer explaining the situation.

Am I approaching this correctly? What's the best I can hope for here? Anything else I can do?

Ebay,Buyer wants to return clothing due to poor fit but my policy is 'no returns' - what to do?,"Hello! I used to sell on Ebay a lot several years ago and have recently started up selling again. I noticed some of the rules regarding returns/defects/etc have changed since then so just thought I'd ask to be sure!

I sold a pair of trousers the other day for £20 including postage. I'm a private seller, my policy is set on all listings to 'no returns', and because of bad experience in the past I always list waist, leg and rise measurements as well as 'please be sure you're buying the correct size as unfortunately I can't accept returns for poor fit' next to the measurements. The buyer messaged me today saying the trousers are too long for her and she'd like to return them. A little frustrating as I did list all measurements including leg length, and that I don't accept returns for poor fit (only for instances where it's clearly my fault for overlooking damage etc)!

I know some basic Ebay safety tips, check the feedback, avoid items with photoshoped images, read the description thoroughly, avoid prices that are too good to be true, etc, but the problem is I'm unsure what appropriate wholesale prices for silver and semi precious stones are, so beyond the obvious, I'm not sure whats too good to be true or not. The piece I'm looking at in particular are semi precious agate set in silver, priced at 32 aud, free shipping, the photos seem genuine and 925 stamps are clearly shown, but, again, that's not hard to fake, especially since the seller is in Indonesia.

Ebay,"Return requested, ipod internal and external serial numbers don't match so they claim it is not as described... can i say no and win?","I sold an ipod saying it was used, beat up, functional, as is, and no returns would be accepted. 




This return request I recieved claims that the serial number on the screen does not match the serial number on the outside case. Therefore there may be 3d party parts in the ipod which ""I am not comfortable with""






I doubt that is the case as I bought this ipod new and never sent it in, but I did not take pictures of the serial numbers at all before sending it.






The buyer is claiming the item is not as described because of the serial numbers.



In my opinion, it doesnt matter if those numbers match and our deal should be final. Also, this guy could very well be scamming me and plan to swap some parts before sending it back. 






Ebay will not tell me what their ruling will be, only that i should try to resolve this before they need to get involved. Do I have a leg to stand on?

So then the seller says that they sent a second shipment separately and that I should wait for it (I don't believe this at all). I told them that I wanted a refund for the missing bulbs asap. They sent me a refund for just one bulb so of course I messaged them back asking for a full refund.

I say yes. However, now the seller is telling me that in order to issue a refund, I have to close the case.

Ebay,I was thinking of making my program Open Source for different sales channels,"Hey guys, a quick background: I used to sell DVDs games etc on eBay, Amazon &amp; my own website but it was a dying business in a way that the effort I was putting in was only maintaining sales in a fading market.

I got out of eSales for a couple of years and have came back in the past year with a very successful eBay business in car parts. I'm a lead software developer for a large company and as I wanted to grow again onto Amazon and my own store I started to create a version 2 of my original software. I have the added advantage of knowing a sellers requirements and the software industry.

My new program has features such as:
- Product &amp; Stock maintenance
- Supports stock from multiple suppliers
- Shipping rates automatically calculated against your rates table
- Automatically listing stock in all the channels
- Pulling orders down from the channels
- Automatic email responses
- Set different pricing for different channels (e.g 9.99 on your website and 10.99 on eBay)
- My favorite feature, the ability to create listing aliases for an item, so you can sell the one item under different eBay listings that all connect back to the one stock record

I have never dealt with a requested return before. From what I gather from reading online, I should probably accept the return and give a refund, otherwise ebay may give the customer the money back anyways due to buyer protection. Can anyone confirm this? 

Anyways, my margins are slim (accepted a best offer under my asking price) and if I am able to re-sell the shirt after the return, I won't be making much profit because of having to pay for the free shipping to a buyer twice. 

Would it be frowned upon to ask the buyer to cover the return shipping cost, as well as the ~3-4 bucks it cost me to get it to them in the first place? 

In general, what's the best thing to do when a buyer requests a return?

Ebay,"Newish (two years old, 3 feedback) buyer purchased an item, but left out their apartment number and messaged it to me. If I add that in, it looks like I won't be eligible for seller protection. Where to start?","This buyer bought a ps4 game I had up for sale, and messaged me two hours later with their apartment number. I replied to them and said they would need to update their eBay and PayPal accounts with their apartment number, and then I would ship the item out. They have not replied yet.

If they don't reply, or don't want to update their address, what should I do? I haven't canceled any orders before, but I wouldn't be opposed to that. This is just a personal eBay account, but I sell most of my games on here when I'm done playing them, and have had this account for 13 years (and am proud of my feedback score), so I'd also like to avoid doing anything that would push the buyer to leave negative feedback.

Ebay,"Constantly getting hit by non-US buyers using reshippers, then trying to scam me. Newest issue: claiming a CD was sent instead of an iphone. How to handle?","In the past 6 months I've sold some high ticket items on ebay. Nothing HUGELY valuable, but a few older iphones and a laptop.

I do not sell to buyers outside of the US for obvious reasons. However it seems the new trend is for foreign buyers to use reshipping services, have an item sent to a US address and then forwarded to them in another country.

The first time this happened to me it was a $300 laptop. I got confirmation of delivery via tracking, but weeks later the person claimed the item never arrived. I spoke to someone at ebay who confirmed the item was delivered, and explained to me what had probably happened. They told me they would make it so the person could not leave feedback, and closed the claim.

The second time it happened, the person bought an iPhone 5s. They send me photos claiming the item was not in the condition described. I told them they were welcome to send it back for a refund, and they said it would cost too much to send it back and would I offer a partial refund of $X. I googled the address they had given me and sure enough it lead to a reshipping center in New Jersey, so I once again called ebay, who once again blocked the person from bidding on my items.

I then had a friend with yet another iPhone 5S which I recently listed for them. It sold, I shipped, to another New Jersey address. This time after 3 weeks the person, much like the last, messaged me claiming the item was damaged and asking straight away for a partial refund.

Knowing exactly what was going on, I flat out said that I knew full well they had the item reshipped to another country, and that they were welcome to return the phone and I would be comparing the serial number to make sure what was sent to me was what I sent out, and then I would issue a refund.

Another two weeks went by and then out of nowhere the person sent me another message saying they had made a mistake and mixed up packages, and in fact the package they got from me contained a Mary J. Blige CD, and did I make a mistake?

I don't even know how to begin to handle this. From what I've heard from people, if a buyer claimed you sent an entirely different item than what was bought, it's pretty open and shut and ebay or paypal will automatically side with the buyer.

Ebay,Someone used my account to order two pieces of camera equipment each worth £200+,"Hello all, I'm from the UK and need some help getting some money back. I tried posting on the eBay Community but to no avail unfortunately.

Last July, in the middle of the night, someone was sadly able to access my account and they managed to order two pieces of camera equipment. One was worth £275.61 and the other was for £213.99. These orders were both made on 05/07/2016. The orders were made for delivery to an address in Leicester. I live in Derby so of course never received these items. 
 
I was very shocked when I woke up to find the two confirmation emails when I checked my phone in the morning so I immediately contacted eBay who assured me that the orders had been cancelled. I also changed my password to all my accounts including my email, social media and of course this eBay account to make sure this couldn't happen again.
 
This was inconvenient as it was only a few days before I went on holiday. Later, on 15/07/2016, I was pleased to see that I was reimbursed for one of the orders and my bank account was credited with £275.61. However, I have not yet been reimbursed for the other order of £213.99. I have called eBay multiple times since then to chase this. I also received a message on 15/07/2016 from the seller regarding the order for £213.99 which worryingly indicates the order was never actually cancelled.
 
Due to me having lots of other things to think about, such as work, I've unfortunately let this linger for a while before I get round to sorting it.
 
How can I go about being reimbursed for my £213.99? I have considered writing to eBay but I worry this may take a long time to receive a response. I have also considered contacting the Police but unfortunately as this kind of crime becomes more and more common there's probably little they can do.

Ebay,Buyer claims item is fake when I know it isn't. Help me round up my ducks?,"Earlier this week I sold a health and beauty item and pretty much the moment the buyer received it they messaged me saying it was fake and asking what I intended to do about it. I am 100% confident it is NOT fake, as it was something I bought straight from the manufacturer's website. We went back and forth a little bit, with me assuring them it wasn't fake (showed pictures from the website to prove that it looked just like it should, told them I had the receipt, etc.). I of course offered a refund upon return in every reply, but the buyer said ""I don't want to have to wait to return it, I want my money NOW."" I quoted eBay policy and said they would get a full refund when I got it back.

So finally they opened a return but listed the reason as ""doesn't seem to be authentic"" and stated that they shouldn't send me back a fake item, they should destroy it instead. I am calling eBay first thing on Monday. I have my receipt and my photos. Is there anything else I should have ready by then?

Ebay,Item arrived damaged scam - for a large item,"Hi there! My brother sells auto parts and sold auto glass to a buyer who said it arrived broken. While this seems almost inevitable with auto glass, the facts are:

- He has shipped hundreds of pieces of glass without issue, his packing skills are unmatched

- The buyer was a new ebayer (signed up that day to buy the glass, zero feedback)

- My brother texted me before shipping to get my thoughts on shipping to this guy. I googled his name (which is a unique name, matching 1 person in the U.S.), and it turns out he is a career criminal with a history of scams (i.e., scammed a disabled neighbor out of her retirement fund). This guy is recently out of prison.

- I suggested to cancel the sale and refund the buyer (granted I'm not a big ebay seller but that was my instinct), but my brother wanted to roll the dice. We agreed he would take extensive pictures of the glass that included it going into the packaging, which he did.

Sure enough, today the buyer called saying the glass arrived damaged (the buyer sounded like a nut job). He said he knew the glass was broken as soon as he lifted the box because it was jingling within the box. My brother asked why he accepted the box (Fedex, he had to sign for it) and he had no answer, dancing around and asking ""what you going to do for me?""

My brother asked to send a picture but the buyer said he doesn't know how to do that through ebay, though it sounds like he might be able to text a picture. They ended the call with the buyer saying he's calling tomorrow to speak with my brother's boss (he is the boss lol).

What's the next best step? Should we ask him to return the glass (shipping is around $50)? Is there any way to force this communication via ebay instead of phone/emails? There is insurance via FedEx but I don't think FedEx should have to pay for this guy's scam. 

His pictures should be interesting. There's a factory part number label on the glass so it will be telling to see how he incorporates that into his pictures.

Sorry this went on and on - I wanted to give the facts, as I know you guys are very skilled in how to handle this! Thanks for any tips :)

Ebay,What do you guys do if you receive the wrong item and don't get a response?,"So bought two buy it now auctions from this guy.  2 items in one, and 1 item in the other.  He did comined shipping, which was cool, even though it was free shipping.  My dilema can really be best summed up in these two messages I sent him: &lt;private information omitted&gt;

Message 1:

    Hey &lt;Him&gt;,

    I received my package today, and I believe it may be missing a part. The items I ordered from you are one for the 'New

    1/2"" Carbide Cutting Wheel, SC544', item number: 230550012649. 

    You said you would combine shipping, which it appears you did, but I think you gave me two EZ lock mandrels instead of an EZ 
    lock mandrel and Carbide Cutting Wheel, in regards to item number 230550012649. It should be clear in the pictures I have 
    attached. Unless there is another package coming with the cutting wheel?

Message 2:

    New message to: &lt;Him&gt;
    Hey there... did you receive my message I previously sent stating you had gotten my oder wrongby chance? Just checking in. I     
    recieved two ez lock mandrels instead of a mandrel and carbide cutting wheel. Looking at your other auctuons, it seems this     
    could be an easy mistake as you sell two mandrels at a time on one of your auctions. You can look at my previous message for 
    picture proof. All I would like is the carbide cutting wheel, what is the next procedure for this situation to become reality?

    Thank you,
    -&lt;Me&gt;

Anyhow, it's been over two days, and I have had no response from him.  Is this something I should be worried about, is this common?  Is there a procedure I should follow?  I really just wanted the Carbide blade for dremel :(  Not to mention I can totally tell that the EZ lock Mandrel's are manufactured differently.  They are close, but there are beveled edged underneath the real one that are not on the one I received.  So is he also seems to be selling some sort of reproductions, regardless I don't care.  It's obvious he just mixed up the one auction with another one of his auctions that sells 2x mandrels.  At least that is my optimistic nature presenting itself.

Ebay,Buyer Improperly Returned an Item,"A buyer bought a coat. The coat's zipper was a little funky and I agreed to take it back and pay for the return label. All was well, he's not pissed, we're happy...BUT. He took it upon himself to just return it to me...without going through eBay's refund procedures. 

This would be okay, but he is saying he paid $16.50 for the postage. What he was supposed to do, was go through eBay refund process, and I would pay for the label and it would cost me the same it cost me to ship it to him originally (which was $10.00). 

The point is: he's not going to get $16.50 from me, because the label would have cost me $10.00 if he just did it the way he was supposed to. But since he just made a PayPal label and did not go through the eBay return process/made an undocumented return, it cost him more. 

I foresee this being a bit of a problem when I get the coat back. I told him he still had to request a refund via eBay, and he did that AFTER already sending the coat. When I click the ""Issue a refund"" button on eBay, it's only going to refund him the price of the coat, plus the original $10 shipping, PLUS another $10 for the label that he totally skipper out on using. He's going to be upset with this, but does that matter? I feel like eBay will side with me, because he took it upon himself to disregard eBay policies by returning the item outside of eBay. But, eBay has surprised me many times before and has screwed me as a seller. 

EDIT: I called eBay. They basically told me I'm not liable for giving this guy the money he wasted on his own label and that they would side with me no matter what feedback he would decide to leave. Doesn't it feel great when eBay sides with you?

Ebay,**UPDATE** Buyer claims item is fake when I know it isn't. Help me round up my ducks?,"[Link to original](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/5w44co/buyer_claims_item_is_fake_when_i_know_it_isnt/) UPDATE:  So we called this morning. Ebay is asking for a letter from the cosmetics company verifying that what we sent is authentic before they will close the case. Evidently a receipt and shipping confirmation from the company isn't enough. I sent an email to the company yesterday, but we plan to call them when business hours start tomorrow. We offered to show the ebay rep the links to the Nordstrom version (the one he was comparing ours to), and the version we had straight from the website to show the clear differences and the fact that the logo on ours was identical but that didn't matter, either. I guess we will have to try our hardest to see if the manufacturer will help us out in some way.

A couple of interesting side notes: I had assumed the buyer was a female end-user, but it is a man who resells. Not that that means he is automatically a scammer, but it does have me a little more concerned, especially in light of the fact that he was so insistent that he couldn't wait to return it and that he needed to replace it NOW. Also, he stated in one of his messages to me (but not in his return request) that he contacted the manufacturer and was told it was fake by them. I was looking at the company website again today and they do have a blurb about counterfeit products and they state that they DO NOT verify authenticity for items bought from ebay. That means he outright lied about having been told by the company it was fake. I mean, I knew he was lying because I know that it's real, but that should serve as a red flag for an outside party as well. Not holding my breath for them to listen to that or look at it if we get the chance to show them, though. 

I think that worst case scenario at this point is that the manufacturer doesn't give us anything helpful and we give up trying to prove it's real and go ahead and accept the return like we tried to do from the beginning before he threatened to destroy it. Does anyone know if will we get to keep our money if he doesn't return it? He has no proof that it is fake because it isn't. Also, I saw where we could include pictures in our response. I will include the receipt and tracking info and hope that will help us get negative feedback removed down the line.",9,18,2017-02-26,EBAY,0.041934363543987274,0.9284365177154541,0.029629036784172058

Ebay,Buyer has strongly implied they will break the product I shipped them to force a refund. How do I protect myself?,"I recently sold a monitor on eBay. In the listing it said very clearly what the price for shipping was, as well as my return policy (no returns). 

A day after I shipped the product, the buyer contacted me because they wanted a refund because they found it cheaper elsewhere. 

I politely explained that I have a no refund policy, and that I hoped they enjoy the product, which works perfectly. 

The buyer continued to message me back over and over getting more and more frustrated with this, and eventually made a strong insinuation that they were going to purposefully break my monitor to trick ebay into thinking it was a dud from the get go.

How do I protect myself in a situation like this? How do I ensure that if they decide to damage the monitor, that I'm not on the hook for their own malignant actions?

-Called USPS, they confirmed that the seller did not use the correct address or include a name on the package, total random address in the same city I live in.

-Item was returned to sender, I contacted sender thru eBay and after three attempts he got back to me and apologized and said he would resend or refund. I opted to have him resend if he included the tracking with the eBay transaction for my protection, which he did. 

-Undeliverable as addressed again, seller once again used the wrong address. 

-Opened money back guarantee claim after seller failed to return any attempts at contact, eBay then put the claim on hold because after I opened the claim the seller shipped the item again.

-Item was supposed to be delivered today. Sat by my window and watched for the mailman all day long. Regular mail came, no package. Four hours later, the tracking says ""Delivered in mailbox"". Even though I never saw the mailman return, I ran out to check it anyways. Nothing. 

-Start suspecting seller is using wrong address on purpose and shipping a bogus item in box to a random address to show that item was delivered.

-Item was over $750, and the seller did not use a ""signature required"" option as the tracking says ""left in mailbox"". Wondering if this is grounds for getting my money back, as I highly doubt USPS has accidentally marked the item as delivered when it was out for delivery all day. 

Will be calling USPS again on Monday when they're opened. I just got off the phone with eBay and they say that since my item shows as delivered on the tracking, they want me to fill out a ic3.gov stolen item report and add it to the case. I just looked over my paypal transactions, and the seller does not have a confirmed paypal address.

Ebay,"First time (trying to be) seller, and this sub already scared me into throwing in the towel.","I'm looking to sell my PS4 since I just bought (on impulse) a PS4 pro. Craigslist in my area is totally saturated with PS4s of all sort, so now I'm looking into selling it on eBay for a competitive price since mine's still in very good condition with all accessories/box ie. I still have everything, including the crappy earphone Sony included with the PS4.

After checking out this sub for a bit, I believe I already got the whole general idea down:

* Take as many pictures as possible; make note of any defect 
* Pack the item as securely as possible
* Ship with tracking number **AND** delivery confirmation
* Take pictures while packing, or even take pictures while you're dropping it off at FedEx/UPS/USPS

Nonetheless, reading through this sub keeps making me second guessing whether I should even bother with eBay. Troves of horror stories about buyers scamming left and right. Doesn't help that this will be my first time selling with a brand new account specifically for selling (already have another account that I use for buying only).

Is scamming that common on eBay? Or am I experiencing a selection bias here ie. everyone else that has zero problem selling never bother to post their story here?

In turn, the seller leaves POSITIVE feedback for me, stating ""BUYER BEWARE: Account owner claims game broken when working JUST FINE.""

Ebay,Buyer claimed item not as described - Ebay refuses to investigate appeal despite evidence,"So I sold a 3DS XL Capture Card. For the listing I took professional lit photographs on my phone, described the item exactly as it was. I took photographs of the item working and turned on I then sent them to a colleague on Whatsapp to document their date (because Whatsapp can't be edited) I also took a screenshot of the viewing software operating on the date of postage.

The buyer received the item and sent this message:
&gt; Hi
&gt; 
&gt; I got the console yesterday and i have turned it on and it is all working absolutely fine. In the auction it said there was the viewer software, but i dont have anything else but the console and the USB cable. Is there a website link you can send me to download it onto my PC?
&gt; 
&gt; Many thanks.
&gt; 


I provided him with the link and the activation key. He responded 2 days later with this

&gt; so when I plug the capture card into my pc nothing shows up (after I've installed all the drivers) so I go to device manager and nothing is showing up there, when I do manage to get it connected it comes up as an unknown device which it shouldn't be doing. 
&gt; 
&gt; I contacted katsukity and they have bounced me back to you. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a chance i can send the device back to you for a refund as I'm not confident with it? 


Apologies if this is long but this clearly shows the buyer had the item working; the usb port detected the item as unkown (which is normal for the device until you properly install the software) but it proves the usb port was working.

He opened a claim that the item was not described.

&gt; Upon researching the problem on the internet the item is know to have USB ports that come loose easily, I believe this to be the case, perhaps this happened in transit &gt; 

He provided images of the packaging; the box was in perfect condition and so was the foam that covered the device and all its ports on the inside; no dents no marks. I pointed this out to show there was no damage in transit; I provided images of Nintendos official packaging; my foam was three times thicker. I also attached my dated screenshot of the software working; and photos of the device turned on and working. 

I called Ebay in concern; who told me to just appeal the case when the item is returned (they never spoke as if the case could be decided in my favour). Ebay decided with the buyer of course; when the item arrived back to me again no denting in the box but the USB port was broken, it looked a little crooked and when plugged in did not get picked up at all. 

I called to appeal; ebay got back to me within 2 days rejecting my appeal on the grounds ""returned item as it is the same with the claim of the buyer."" I called Ebay today to say that I want to both report the buyer for abusing ebays return claims but also make a case that Ebay did not do sufficient evidence; I brought into light that upon arrival the buyer stated the item was working ""absolutely fine"" I highlighted the buyer stated ""It connects"" as an ""unkown device"" proving that the USB port was not damaged. I explained the buyer had expressed wanting a refund on the basis of not being confident rather than it being broken. I went over the packaging and how no dents in the box make it seem highly unlikely if not impossible damage occurred in transit. I even have the dated photos saved on Whatsapp to prove the date can't have been tampered with.

&gt; Item defective during first use: The first time the buyer tried to use the product, it didn't work (e.g. HDTV did not turn on).

Is one of the accepted reasons Ebay gives for researching their cases; and the buyer said on first use ""it is ALL working absolutely fine"" 

I was told because ""ebay hasn't seen the item"" there's nothing Ebay can do; that the issue is between myself and the buyer and I should contact the buyer or the local authorities. 

I obviously pointed out that the same argument could be used for not being able to step in for the return request; but Ebay took it upon themselves to investigate; that I have provided sufficient evidence that the buyer contradicted his claims and stated the item was working; and physical evidence of the item working. The manager told me that eBay regrets that they are not overturning their decision and I should take up damaging the items on the buyers side with the local authorities.

So I basically would like some advice on who I should go to next. eBay has obviously made themselves very liable here in a small claims court; I mentioned the financial burden, eBay failed to communicate to me or allow me to choose the address of returns; So I payed in fuel to go to a 2nd address to pick it up. Holding my money and reimbursing it to the buyer put me in financial peril interrupted my work as I couldn't buy an upgraded camera for my work after selling my old one. I've sold over 1k of products in the last 1 month all positive feedback; all working. 

I want to start a shop on eBay, I was told eBay that ebay ""assures"" me they are ""committed to protecting sellers as well as buyers"" but this has not been the case with this manager.


Thanks if you read all of this, sorry it was long.

**TL;DR** - Buyer bought capture card, said was working and USB picked it up as ""unknown device"" buyer expresses wanting a return because of ""not being confident"", Buyer opens a case ""Item not as described in listing"" in his description he claimed insufficient packaging resulting in a broken USB and attached photos of undamaged box and THICK foam protective layer. Ebay tells me to wait to appeal the case upon return. I attach dated photos and screenshots of item working. Ebay sides with buyer and buyer returns item. Item is now broken. Ebay refuses to investigate appeal. I speak to manager who concludes because Ebay cannot see the item Ebay can't step in.

Ebay,"Buyer: received empty box, what do?","Hi reddit,

This my first post so please be kind, I ordered a second hand (though recent) camera off Ebay last week. The seller has a 99,6% rating and over 30.000 feedback over the past 12 months, so i felt confident about the seller in general.

I paid through PayPal (with buyer's protection) and they shipped it (with tracking) a day later. The package arrived today and immediately felt this sinking feeling when i picked up the box (a co-worker accepted the package at the door), it felt way too light for a camera. I opened the box and confirmed what i secretly already knew, apart from some packing material and a random coupon the box was empty. 

What is the best cause of action here? The feedback of the seller really made me feel confident about buying there, the description was accurate and not too generic (just listing the specs and so on). So i have my doubts i am being scammed, i of course contacted the seller (through email and eBay) and filed a dispute through PayPal (which i haven't escalated yet) claiming ""Not as described"".

I know in hindsight, filming me opening the box would have taken a lot of doubt away (with the seller or PayPal) but that is just hindsight i guess...

Is there any more i can do, and how long should i wait for the seller to reply before i escalate it?
Thanks for any help, and if there is nothing more at least i can sleep a little easier tonight


ps: the last weird thing was the notice on the box stating 3.0KG which is in no way near the weight of the actual (empty) box.  So did they fake it and is this a scammer's trick or does it mean the object was stolen in transit? The box and packaging looked unopened

UPDATE:
I spoke to the seller by phone and he claims he did sent the item and no mistake was made. He urged me to file an incident report with the shipping company (DHL), which i called and they sent me the forms.
