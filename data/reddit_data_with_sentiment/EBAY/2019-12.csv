Ebay,Promoted listings + Best offer auto accept on an unpaid item can bite you. Beware!,"Today i closed and unpaid item case and got my final value fees credited back. The item sold via promoted listings. Called eBay asking if they could also credit for Ad fee. They told me they could do it, but only **one time in 12 months period**. So, where it could get nasty is. Few weeks back someone made an offer on a shirt i was selling. It was listed for 22.50$, with ""Automatically accept offers of at least"" option ticked. A buyer made a bogus offer of 2000$ and it automatically got accepted. Buyer didn't pay, I didn't send, case opened, closed, final value fees credited back. Glad it didn't sell via promoted listings in which case i would have to pay 200$ at 10% ad rate or use my **one time ad fee** credit option.

***Conclusion***

Maybe it's not such a good idea to do ""Auto accept offers of at least"" on listings that are promoted.

***Question***

Why doesn't eBay refund Ad fees on unpaid items as they do with Final value fees?

&amp;#x200B;

**\*Edit\***

Found an article that kinda gives an answer to my question. As i'm not allowed to post a direct link, here's the title for search - eBay Promoted Listing Ad Fee Not Refunded when you Cancel a Transaction

**\*Edit 2\***

So, **i guess** they do refund Ad fees automatically. Why did the eBay employee say they usually don't is not clear to me. Maybe doing it manually is a one time option in 12 months. Why didn't she state that i would be getting Ad fees credited automatically is weird and confusing to me. But, it's good news i guess. Will update once i do or don't get the credit for the listing.

**\*Edit 3\***

Yes, ad fee credits showed up next month.",24,33,2019-12-01,EBAY,0.03480102866888046,0.9339850544929504,0.031213978305459023
Ebay,Questions about selling on eBay.,"I just started selling on eBay again. I want to get rid of as many things as possible since I am moving soon. I have a few questions about how I can improve my eBay store.

* should I offer free shipping? will I get more attention?
* should I end my prices in .99 or .00? does it even make a big difference?
* Does it make any difference if I write a long description or not? 
* What about item specifics? will I get more views if I add more specifics?
* does offering a return policy help? I heard that offering a return policy helps because eBay's search engine benefits sellers with a return policy and you will get more views.

Ebay,Do people not know they're abusing media mail?,"Or am I the only one with a conscience?

I've ordered two things now, except one hasn't even shipped yet, that do have a sort of media but both have large items that come with them that are obviously not media. But both sellers are/planning to ship these media mail. I noticed it on the box of this Cinderella jewelry box that has the full Cinderella Blu Ray/DVD collection inside. Doesn't qualify but was sent media. The other thing, I won a new elf on the shelf set and this was the day before Thanksgiving and it still hasn't shipped. Not even a label. I'm a seller too so I just can't fathom how so many people do this? Maybe it's because I'm new and eventually people stop caring?

Ebay,Buyer asked for refund but has not initiated a return.,"Last week I sold a digital item code for a video game (I know, I know. I've since learned that I should have used a classified adds listing). I checked that the Paypal payment went through and sent them the code. 

The next day the buyer sent me a few fragmented messages asking for a refund. After some back and forth, the messages culminated in them saying their account was hacked and they never actually bought the item ([X]Doubt). I sent them a reply in which I commiserated with them about the hacking and attached some resources from the Ebay help pages. I then said I would be happy to help them with the refund if they started the return process for the sale.

I am fully prepared to refund the seller and forget about it, but I want to be sure I'm doing it properly. They didn't open a return request and there are no open cases in my resolution center. They also have not responded to my last message. 

So I am left with a few questions...

-Would it be unwise to refund them without them initiating a return? 

-How would I refund them without them starting a return? 

-If they don't initiate a return am I obligated to refund them?

-Is there anything to do now but wait? 

-If nothing else happens at what point can I consider this issue finished?

Ebay,Can We Take a Moment to Say Some GOOD Things About eBay changes?,"There's a lot of negative ones on here... many of which are justified... but it's not all bad. I can think of a couple of eBay changes over time that I like. 

\- Sales Tax. This was a long time coming but more and more states are charging online sales tax. eBay has made this easy for us, though, by collecting and paying it themselves. They could have easily just let us deal with filing and submitting sales tax in numerous states but they got us on this. 

\- Feedback Removal. I can think of a time when they would NEVER remove negative feedback unless it cussed or revealed personal information. It didn't matter if they lied or the shipper damaged the package or if they didn't read the description or even if you got dinged for opening up a non-payment case against a non-paying buyer. eBay would refuse to remove it. 

They've made that way easier now. Just today I was reminded of that again. A buyer that never even contacted us first left us a negative complaining about an item missing in the box. Never mind that the listing stated plainly that same item was, in fact, not included. Took a 4 minute eBay call to fix it and get it removed. 

It wasn't always like that. I'm grateful it is now.",42,29,2019-12-02,EBAY,0.04932123050093651,0.9157450199127197,0.03493371978402138
Ebay,Does anyone else who uses the Ebay App on IOS have problems with crashing when accessing camera roll??,So I’ve been dealing with this for many months now.

It’s extremely frustrating cause I end up having to type listings 2-3 times over for every other item. Does anyone else have this problem? I’ve searched so many times and have done all the things.

The USPS tracking on the website clearly says ""delivered"".  


I even emailed the customer with a screenshot and they just wrote back "" I have not received my package. ""

UPDATE: 
Post office said it was delivered and mailman remembers putting it in the mailbox. 

Buyer says they don’t care and they are going to leave a negative review unless they get it.

Ebay,Is there anyway to re-list items and keep watcher / sold count?,"Had ebay put a hold on my account. Looks like a lot of sales in a short time got my account suspended, and now they reduced my selling limits. They won't allow me to sell in my best selling category, but I can sell in every other category going forward.

Two questions:

1) I had listings in other categories that are not affected but were removed by ebay initially. These had many watchers and sold count. Can I restore these listings?

2) Some listings I had removed could be put in other categories. Is there anyway to restore these listings and then change the category before restocking them to keep sold count?

Edit: All my listings show up in both ""ended"" and ""unsold"". Looks like they cannot restore these listings, so is the best course of action to click ""relist"" under the ended section? Seemed to be what they said over the phone, but just wanted to make sure. 

Obviously, certain items I won't relist to be comply with ebay's category restrictions.

He also said the card that he used would not allow him to do a refund on it. So if I didn't send it to his new address he was going to lose the money.

Ebay,update for my post where a buyer started to threaten me with bad feedback for postal delays,"[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/e322yn/just_looking_for_advice_on_what_to_do_next_with/)

So in short, the item failed to arrive in the time specified by the postal service. Buyer threatened to affect my feedback and no amount of reasoning helped. Buyer opened a dispute requesting full refund.

&amp;#x200B;

In reply to the dispute I said I would wait till the 6th Dec and if the item didn't arrive I would refund in full. I had till the 8th to action. Didn't go down too well. Contacted ebay by phone to check I was all good doing this and they agreed.

Buyer had the item sent to a shop for click and collect. Had the idea this morning to contact the shop to see if the item had arrived and the tracking info was wrong.

Couldn't find a contact number for the shop which worked and the owner had no social media footprint (small convenience store).

Remembered I bought a used PC through classifieds off a guy in the same city where the click and collect shop was located and we still spoke from time to time. Sent him a message asking if he lived near the shop. The city is a 100 miles from me unfortunately.

He lives in a moderately large city so I was in the last chance saloon he'd be within reasonable distance. I don't know anyone else there.

Couldn't believe it when he said he lived on the same road! He ended up sending me a picture of his license as I was in total disbelief!

He ended up taking a trip to the shop and speaking with the guy who worked there (while I listened on the phone) which given the language barrier I wouldn't have had a chance over the phone.

Store guy eventually brings out the package and confirms it has arrived.

*Tracking mysteriously updates minutes later.*

Contacted ebay again by phone and they closed the dispute and said feedback for the sale would be removed (he left negative feedback but it appears to have gone). Also asked if I wanted to report the buyer for poor conduct but I didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully all goes well from here in and he doesn't decide to destroy the item and send it back claiming damage / faulty.",12,31,2019-12-03,EBAY,0.09972185641527176,0.8727803826332092,0.027497807517647743

Ebay,Shipping from US to Canada,"Hello,

I had a buyer message me over the weekend after purchasing and paying for an item asking me to ship it to an address in Canada where their profile is based, but the shipping address listed was North Dakota. 

Long story short, I offered to cancel that listing and create a new listing for them with international shipping options to Canada, they have now paid and I have some questions about the shipping process to Canada.

I want to ship the package through USPS Priority mail international, this will cost me $50. Ebay is only display the option to purchase International flat rate medium, large and international priority mail express shipping options through the site. I would prefer to pay the $50 that I saw on the USPS website calculator for International Priority Mail and not the $75 for International Priority Mail Express that Ebay is giving me the option for. 

The buyer has no preference on the shipping speed, but I have only ever printed shipping labels directly from Ebay where the tracking is included and Ebay places a hold on my funds until the item is delivered. 

What I don't understand is how this process works if I print a label through USPS. If I print the Priority Mail International label through USPS, how do I inform Ebay and the buyer that the item has been shipped? Will I still get the hold on my funds lifted when the item is delivered or will it take the full 3-4 week theoretical period?",4,5,2019-12-03,EBAY,0.02777118608355522,0.9391160607337952,0.03311276435852051

Ebay,Ebay sided with buyer despite tracking - gave a full refund. After item arrived they still drag their feet in issuing a reimbursement.,"I sold multiple numbers of 3 different items to a single buyer. It was vintage clackers and the 3 different items were various colours.

10 Green - $201.28

7 Black - $140.90

3 Red - $40.26

All 20 of the items were placed into 1 single box and readied to be shipped from Canada to UK. I gave the buyer a shipping quote for both ground shipping (about $60) and air shipping (close to $100)

They were upset that the price was so high and said ""Could you please tell me how you arrive at the cost for postage. To post a 1 kilo parcel from the uk to Canada , with tracking and 7 day delivery is £18 sterling, you have quoted almost £65""...I told them the package was much bigger than that and was weighing in at close to 2.5 kilo, so the price is a bit more. Frankly, the buyer underestimated the amount of items they bought.

All items were combined together during check out and the buyer was issued a single invoice with combined shipping with the total amount being $382.44

Invoice gets paid, item shipped August 15, 2019 and customer was given the estimated delivery of 6-8 weeks.

September 2 buyer opens an item not received case. ""Sep. 2 : The buyer didn't receive the item. Buyer wants A refund. Comments:Hi I have still not receive my item, do you have a tracking number"" Despite being provided a tracking number the moment I sent it. They played the angle of ""no tracking info""

I called up ebay customer support and they said that they can put the Buyer complaint on 10 day hold and that my appeal to the complaint was successful since I provided tracking as soon as I sent the package and they can see that the item is in transit.

Next day: Ebay charged my credit card and issued a full refund in the 3 amount increments. $201.28 - $140.90 and $40.26

I called up support again and they said that the customer should never have been even able to open a dispute so soon. They said they have an estimated delivery date of Dec 24 (I still don't know where they got that date from, but I just have to accept their word). I told them once again that Canada Post says about 60 days. So it should be arriving on or around October 15 so nothing should be able to be done until then.

Email support got back to me that I have to contact Canada Post and file a lost package insurance claim. I argued back and forth that nothing can be done until 60 days and Canada Post says I just have to wait. Them: ""Call up Canada Post and file an insurance claim"". So I filed the insurance claim and received back a form on Canada Post letterhead that said there's nothing that can be done until after 60 days as the item needs time to reach the destination and clear customs. I forwarded the letter to Ebay email support and they tell me: ""Contact Canada post and file a lost package insurance claim""

That's about the time I told them to go fuck themselves and that the entire email support centre is only useful for being used as a Nuclear Bomb Test Range. I was far from impressed.

Now I have an idea where things went wrong. Instead of every agent looking at the 3 item numbers as a single case because of the combined shipping...they looked at them as 3 separate shipments. So somehow the one item for $40.26 was sucessfully overturned and returned to me on Sept 24, but the other 2 were still outstanding.

I called up phone support and they said that this shouldn’t have happened (again!) and unfortunately there’s nothing that can be done for the other 2 amounts until the tracking shows that it’s delivered.

Fast forward to Oct 10 when Canada Post tracking updated the status and shows that “Item has arrived in foreign country. United Kingdom”

Oct 17 - “Item Successfully delivered”

I call up ebay. “See. there. There you go. It made it like I said it would. It’s 2 days later than they said, but on a 60 day shipping time 2 days over isn’t bad”

Ebay support said they have to go thru the “back end” and “appeals team” or whatever…but they’ll fully reimburse me and go after the buyer for the money. It would take 7-10 days for the money to be refunded.

A little more than 10 days later I get the refund on Oct 30 of $140.90.  But the $201.28 is still outstanding so I call again.

They tell me that “the refund was issued for that amount in British Pounds instead of Canadian dollars, so it was denied. Someone put in a £ instead of a $”….that’s all they needed for a monkey wrench to throw it right off the rails. They ten told me “It’d be 7-10 days”

10 days I call again.  “ok. I don’t know why it didn’t go through.  I’ll re-submit, but it’ll take 7-10 days”

I called again and again and again.  Still to this very day Dec 3rd…..74 days after the money was taken…. I have not received the $201.28

Ebay,"Buyer doesn't claim package at customs, whose fault? Seller or Buyer?","I shipped product out to buyer Oct.19th.  It arrived in buyer's country on Oct 25th and held at customs.  Buyer didn't know this I guess wasn't following the tracking info I gave.  Customs doesn't call the buyer even though I put the buyer's phone number on the shipping info.  So many days pass with package stuck at customs.  Buyer finally messages me Nov. 18th saying didn't receive order.
I gave the buyer customer service number to call them to get package since it's held at customs.  Buyer didn't call them.
Many days passed.  Dec.2, buyer messages me saying customs told buyer they sent the package away for destruction (buyer eventually called them probably on Dec 1 or 2).  The expiration of the hold was Nov. 25th, exactly 1 month since it arrived.

So who would be at fault here if this were to open into a case and escalated to ebay?  Would they side with buyer or with seller?

Seems like they should side with seller as the package was delivered and buyer didn't claim it at customs.  But I can't take that risk right now so I decided to just refund the buyer minus the shipping cost and buyer was cool with that.  I still feel little upset because I did everything right and buyer was just being a deadbeat not calling customs when I told buyer to call and get your package.",5,3,2019-12-04,EBAY,0.10720576345920563,0.8661660552024841,0.026628177613019943
Ebay,"""Thats just the cost of doing business""","Ive been in a battle with ebay over an item I sold  on their platform. It was returned to me once due to an issue with the item that wasn't present when I sold it. I went through the return process and then relisted it for a little less than my original asking price. I put in the ad that the item was as-is and that I would not have time to test it  ( moving across the country ). The item then sold again and i shipped it out only to have them message me weeks later saying that it was going to cost $500 to get it fixed, which is to be expected due to the already half the current market price I was offering it at. I denied the offer and he then opened a case with the moneyback guarantee program. He listed the reason as ""item is defective'. , which it was as described in the ad. eBay then to decide in his favor and let him return the item , at my cost for shipping. Item came back and was even more damaged than before. Looked like a toddler packed it AND he didn't know how to properly take some parts of the item and broke an internal part rending it even more useless. Called eBay to see if what i can do and they basically told me Im fucked. They let this asshole get away with abusing their money back guarantee.

Ebay,"This buyer seems really fishy with this return, what do you guys think?","So about 20 days ago I sold a copy of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Legacy Pro Edition brand new but not sealed thanks Gamestop. Either way the disc and codes were new as well. So I put the listing up, it sold in few days. Shipped, received, done. And two weeks after I sold it, he sent me a refund request claiming the disc didn't work and that the codes were invalid. Along with some pictures of the bottom of the disc. So either he fucked up the disc or it's just a completely different copy of the game. And the codes were definitely valid when I sent the game to him so I don't know how they wouldn't work.

I decided to check his profile to see his feedback, all positive (only has 15 tho) and turns out he also sells games. It's kind of weird how he's selling two copies of Infinite Warfare on his profile. One which looks extremely similar to my old copy (same Gamestop sticker). I'm definitely am going to decline the refund and nicely tell him to fuck off.

Ebay,I'm permanently banned from Ebay.,I called the number that was requested to me about the ban. They said I didn't complete an order back in 2006 and thats what prompted the ban. No appeal possible and I'm not allowed to make a new account with my personal information. They also said that I'm not worth the risk of retrieving my old account because of all the fake accounts they've been getting lately. I asked if they could simply check if my account was hacked. They repeated the same story and then made a closing statement. They hung up before I could ask if I could talk to anyone else. When I recollect my thoughts I'll phone back.

Ebay,"eBay keeps reminding me I need to raise my rating as a seller, but unable to list what I sell?","So about 2 months ago I had some family business going on and I was delayed in some of my shipments this caused my eBay account to take a hit in my percentage of on-time shipments xcetera.

I tried calling them and I realize you get different answers from different people but the person was basically like I need to find a genre of item that it will allow me to sell and then get my account up that way if that makes sense.

But I sell mostly used high-end sunglasses and some electronics.

Ebay,How to handle BS return requests?,I have had 2 refund requests for computer related items recently. First item was very expensive to ship. Buyer claimed item was defective but upon return there was nothing wrong with it and i ended up selling item upon relisting. But what sucked is I ended up being out over $90 in shipping to and from 1st buyer. Second time was today. A buyer requested a refund/return claiming item he bought was missing parts. I pointed out to him there are 2 versions of item he purchased and even sent him a youtube video of how to use the one he purchased. I also told him it was stated in my eBay listing there as more than one version and it was random which he would receive.  This was not good enough and he still wanted his money back. I issued a refund and told him to keep item because it would have been more in lost shipping back and forth for item than what it was worth. How do anyone else handle situations like this.

Ebay,A letter to eBay management regarding service metrics,"Hey all. I know some might think writing a letter is a bit silly but I've had really good luck with it over the years. When I first started this business Paypal shut me down for growing too fast and basically insinuated that I must be doing something illegal. I wrote a letter to management and my account manager reached out to me two days later and said that was the difference between getting the account opened or not. I also had a decent amount of luck reaching out to Amazon this way. That said, I think the new service metrics are absurd and poorly implemented and thought I'd let eBay know.  Let me know your thoughts... 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To whom it concerns,   
&gt;  
&gt;Hello eBay! I’m writing to you today to express some concerns with the relatively new service metrics system and how they are affecting niche sellers like us. I own a company that primarily sells used professional cinema cameras. Cinema cameras are by nature: complex. The cameras we sell offer virtually unlimited control over the video being taken and because of that, if you’re new to these kinds of cameras (as many of our customers are) it is easy to use them improperly without knowing that you’re doing so. The camera built into the phone in your pocket auto-focuses but the camera we're selling you may not and if you don’t know this, you might think it’s not working. This is a way of life for us. We know that the majority of items that are returned to us because they don’t work will end up working just fine when we get them. In fact, we use unique SKUs and you can see that these items are generally re-listed the same day we close the return and are never returned by their next buyer.   The original buyer simply didn’t understand a particular function. For 9 out of the 10 years we’ve been selling on eBay this has worked just fine… We have always offered at least 14 day returns regardless of reason so it was no big deal to us that the item wasn't actually broken because the customer could have returned it either way under our return policy. The only thing we’re “out” is return shipping that we had to pay because of the customer’s return reason but to be frank, even that wasn’t a big deal because it’s happened 14 times over the last 12 month period. We consider it a cost of doing business and have for 10 years. The return reason just didn’t matter that much. That is right up until the point eBay started counting “item not as described” returns/ cases against us.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now it suddenly matters very much and according to the service metrics calculator we’ll be paying an additional 5% in final value fees next month in our primary sales category. Why? Are we constantly letting customers down? No. We have stellar feedback. We are well respected in our industry. Are we actually sending out broken equipment? No. That’s not to say that some used equipment doesn’t fail. It certainly does but the vast majority of the returns we get for items that aren’t working end up not being broken at all. So what’s the issue? The issue is that we are low volume and a few errant transactions can really mess things up for us. Such is the case now. I won’t name the specifics but we’ve had at least 4 item not as received returns over the last 8 weeks that were anything but and because of that we’ll be paying eBay 5% more for what? And how do we fix it? We wait for transactions to fall off over the 12 month calendar year. The problem is that the next transaction to fall off doesn’t occur until March of 2020. And that single transaction likely won’t be enough to pull us from “very high” to “high”. But even if it did, that means that we can’t have a single additional “not as described” return in the next three months. That is simply unrealistic. And what makes it all exponentially more frustrating is what I discovered when trying to see what we’d need to do to fix this problem:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Metrics seem intentionally ambiguous**   
&gt;  
&gt;eBay tells us that we are compared against other sellers listing in our same category with similar return options and similar condition items. The problem is literals nobody can tell us if that includes sub-categories or just the photo/ camera category as a whole. It doesn’t tell us if adding sales of new accessories to get our transaction count up will have any affect or if it will affect the sellers we’re compared against and change the metric once again. Worse than this is the fact that the goal post is constantly moving. There is no number we can target to fix this. A few years ago there was a similar problem with order defects that was eventually rolled back but at least then ebay set clear and unambiguous goals that all sellers had to meet. There was no ambiguity. No guessing. No wondering what the “high” number was in November versus December. We were given clear percentage numbers that we had to hit and were shown real time updates on where we stood in relation to those numbers. Conversely, looking at the the existing service metrics page shows me a meter with two numbers: my percentage of item not as described returns is in the middle of the orange and the percentage of item not as described returns for the average seller is in the yellow. The placement of the two dots on the meter is in the middle of each color. There is no scale. There is absolutely no way for me to know what percentage of item not as described returns we need to get down to to get from “high” to “average” or “very high” to “high”. Businesses live and die by the data and you simply are not supplying it. Worse yet, next month the number will likely change. How are we expected to succeed when you don’t adequately define the metrics we are judged by and are constantly moving the goal post?  But wait, there’s more! The little data you do offer isn’t available. As of today (12/9/2019) the downloadable report for the “item not received” service metric doesn’t work and hasn’t for at least 3 weeks. That’s across various browsers. It simply doesn’t work; instead outputting an error: “We ran into a problem but we’re working on it. Please try again later”. I’ve been trying again later for 3 weeks now. How long until it works? Both the quantity and quality of the data you provide is severely lacking and for something that will end up costing some sellers a significant amount of money, this is not ok. Beyond that, not having clear and well defined goals for your sellers to reach and then charging them 50 - 90% more in fees when they fail to do so is just poor form. It’s a constant guessing game.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Agents are poorly trained**  
&gt;  
&gt;To date I have spoken to four agents about service metrics. Three of the four agents were in call centers overseas. Two of them needed me to explain to them what service metrics were before they were able to respond to my concerns. I can’t adequately express how frustrating it is to speak to a representative that doesn’t appear to understand basic ebay policies, let alone more involved policies, completely fail to understand what my concerns are or why I might be frustrated and completely lack the ability to transfer me to someone that might. It is absolutely unacceptable that your sellers have to explain policy to the the very people they rely on to answer questions about that same policy. And there is no option for escalation from there. These poorly trained agents are the first and last point of contact for a problem that has serious implications. The only option to bypass them is to continue calling in until you get someone else. That is absurd. More absurd than that is the fact that the information varies from agent to agent.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the two agents I spoke to that understood the policy without it needing to be explained to them, very clearly did not understand the nature of the policy. She suggested we just stop taking returns or that if someone returned an item and it ended up working after they claimed it didn’t that we should open up a case and deny the return. Two problems with that:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. It doesn’t solve the problem because customers can still open item not as received cases even when a buyer does not accept returns.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. We don’t have any problem accepting the returns, even if the item ends up working when it’s returned to us. We sell very complicated items and we know returns like this are a cost of doing business.   
&gt;  
&gt;3. The entire point of these service metrics is to ensure a better buyer experience. How does denying a return and asking eBay to step in offer a better buyer experience? It makes us look bad and it makes eBay look bad.   
&gt;  
&gt;The fourth representative I spoke to was the only one that explained that we could report buyers for using the wrong return reason and that this is the ONLY way a return would be reviewed and potentially removed from our metrics. Again though, this is horribly implemented. As a seller I am under the impression that reporting a buyer is a bad thing and to be quite honest, most of our customers returning items as broken genuinely believe their item isn’t working, even if it is. I’m not looking to put a flag on their account or get them in any kind of hot water. And yet this is the only official way to have these improperly categorized returns reviewed? How am I as a seller to know that? It took four agents to find that out. FOUR. That is simply not acceptable, not when the implication is that you will be receiving thousands of dollars in additional fees from us next month because of it. Beyond that, apparently if we don’t report the buyer before we close the return it is never able to be reviewed and according to the agent, the team that works these reviews is internal and can not be emailed or called. How is that the case? And again, it took four separate agents to get this information.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Metrics are easily manipulated**  
&gt;  
&gt;We can simply start selling an accessory with a historically low return rate in the photo/ camera category to get our transaction count up and dilute the current returns we have to lower our percentages but why? For one, how accurate is any system that can so easily be manipulated? But beyond that, how is us redirecting resources from our core business going to result in a better experience for eBay customers? It won't. It’s a distraction and the only beneficiary of this distraction is eBay in the form of additional fees. We went through this a few years ago with order defects. For a short time we became the number one seller of cat 5 network cables. Did that make us any better or worse at our core business? No. It just made us less vulnerable to the fluctuating metrics that affect low volume sellers so harshly. I applaud you guys for learning some lessons and implementing the 10 unique transaction rule to protect low volume sellers however I would argue that it’s too little. We’re *just* beyond this number and were well below it all year. Our service was no better then and it’s no worse now. The sample of data is just too small to be accurate.   
&gt;  
&gt;**No means of appealing the decision**  
&gt;  
&gt;There were days not very long ago where I could call seller performance and speak to a US based customer service agent that had the ability to deal with problems and if they they didn’t, they could at least reach out to someone that could. There was some nuance. Some ability to look at unique situations and try to have an understanding for them. Those days are apparently gone. Agents say they have no control over this. They have nobody to suggest that we contact. The mis-categorized returns we closed before reporting as being mis-categorized? There’s nothing that can be done about them because there is nobody to reach out to. There’s a complete unwillingness to look at any particular situation. This could be understandable if the metrics were detailed and the goal post was clearly labeled. It could be understandable if customer service agents were properly trained and didn’t freely and confidently give out inaccurate information. It could maybe be understandable if it was clear who sellers were being compared to or if the reports for service metrics didn’t chronically fail to work. Unfortunately none of that is the case and as such, sellers should have a means of appealing these metrics before they are counted against them.   
&gt;  
&gt;eBay does a lot of stuff right. It is not lost on us that the only constant is change and that in business you need to adapt. Our business has changed in many ways over the last ten years. We are constantly seeking ways to improve our performance and increase customer satisfaction and in this competitive environment I understand that eBay needs to do the same. A lot of the changes we’ve made over the years were hits but there were also misses. We acknowledge our misses and fix them. eBay, please do the same and either fix the service metrics system or eliminate it. It is disheartening that I will be paying you guys several thousand dollars more next month despite offering the same great service I’ve offered for 10 years.   
&gt;  
&gt;I’m not expecting a response to this but if we could get an agent to go over some of these old item not as described cases over the past year that are counted against us, that would be much appreciated. For the sake of other sellers that remain silent and just pay the higher fees, I hope that this is an opportunity you will afford others in the form of at the very least a much better transaction appeal/ report process.

Ebay,Seller offering a partial refund on a nonworking item and I’m in a time constraint,"I purchased a vintage toy for our daughter that was listed as working. It arrived and the smell when I open the box of cigarettes was so overwhelming (not to mention we’ve been fighting Norovirus in the house and vomiting the past couple of days anyway) that I started to gag. I said it’s OK I’ll try and clean it-no big deal, but when I went to the store I got new batteries and put them in and the tape player works but the mouth and the eyes don’t work. It’s a very expensive cassette player. I messaged the seller to see it said whoops “it worked when I listed it”, which is completely bogus.

 The problem is it is getting close to Christmas and the ones that I see listed don’t have a delivery date until after the holidays and I think it’s possible I can repair this one. I’m really pissed that it was listed as in working condition and initially I wasn’t going to say anything about the cigarettes but on top of it not working that’s just really a pain in the ass. 

I am inclined to except a partial refund but I’m wondering for how much because the seller did not say. I paid $75 for it after winning an auction no one else bid on.",10,4,2019-12-10,EBAY,0.06840027868747711,0.8980712890625,0.03352844715118408

Ebay,Three times on the same item I get no payment - a weird coincidence?,"First time posting and I did a search and didn't find anything that matched my situation so here goes:

Selling an apple watch series 3 gps on eBay and I timed it so that the auction would end on Black Friday in the US.  Worked like a charm... except that moments later I get a message from eBay saying the buyer wants to cancel.  No reason why and I was traveling so through their app there didn't appear to be any recourse.  I was bummed but whatever... cancelled it and relisted but as a 3-day auction as I just wanted to sell the watch.  Auction ends and low and behold it sells well and AGAIN the buyer cancels!!!  Both times the buyer happened to be someone with (0) or very low feedback, which I'm always leery of in general.  Super weird but okay let's try to do second offer...nothing.  So I relist it a 3rd time and geezus ....it happens AGAIN.  This time the person even contacted me and simply said ""I bid by mistake.""  And then she ghosted me.  

Have I run a streak of bad luck with this damned watch or is this becoming a thing on eBay?  I personally dislike the entire platform now as a large number of the auctions I've had in the past few years have been difficult.  Maybe it's just the stuff I'm selling (mostly tech) that's attracting the riffraff but i'm over it.

Ebay,For what reasons can a seller cancel a sale?,"I bought a bike lock the other day and the seller messaged me a few days later saying the shipping had been incorrectly calculated and that I would need to pay x amount more for them to ship it and in what way did i want to proceed. I politely told them I thought it was unfair to retroactively charge me extra and that it was their error and therefore they should take the loss not me. They then cancelled my order. The product is still live and has the same shipping cost displayed for me as it did in the first time (they haven't fixed it) but somehow they lowered the price of the item (strange). 

My question is; what are the legitimate reasons for which a seller can cancel an order? I always thought that when you clicked the ""buy it now"" button or whatever both the buyer and the seller commit to buy or sell the product respectfully. It says so when you confirm your purchase. is there some way I can contest this and get my item for the original price or is them cancelling the sale perfectly legitimate.",31,3,2019-12-12,EBAY,0.3024304509162903,0.652327835559845,0.045241717249155045

I am sending a bicycle wheel out tomorrow that I've just sold. The box that I am using is 25 x 25 x 5 inches, 3 pounds.

I've noticed when I plug slightly smaller dimensions to the ebay calculator (25x24x5) the USPS Ground price comes out to $10.60, however if I add just an inch (25x25x5) the price is suddenly $32.10... I am wondering how often these packages are measured at sorting facilities to ensure dimension accuracy and or if anyone has ever had one sent back over being an inch too big?

I would hate to have to spend an extra $21 for an additional inch of width and will cram it into a smaller box if needed, Fedex and UPS prices are almost double the $10.60 for that size.",13,3,2019-12-12,EBAY,0.023705163970589638,0.9120276570320129,0.06426717340946198

Ebay,The more you know ... sales tax and seller protection changes,"So I accidentally found out an interesting tidbit while on the phone with PayPal the other day.  

So, as with eBay, we know, you need to use signature confirmation on items that are priced at over 750.  This has been the case with PayPal as well for a while.  However! Fun little change.  If your item comes to 750 or under with eBay but above 750 with sales tax, PayPal requires signature confirmation for their seller protections  (even though eBay says you still don't for theirs).  So, there's that.  In these cases eBay will not automatically check off the signature required box on the shipping label, so make sure you don't forget!

Ebay,Funds still on holds 10 days after Buyer received item?,"Hi. A few weeks ago I sold a CPU on eBay, my first item I've sold.

I haven't paid the ""monthly invoice fee"" for last month if that matters?

Is my only option left to either wait for the 21 days or call their support number? I would GREATLY prefer not having to call them, but I'm a bit strapped for cash right now and I need my funds ASAP. I don't know what possible reason they could have to keep my money on hold still.

I sold a laptop almost two days ago. I didn't offer international shipping and I am not enrolled in GSP. A buyer in Egypt won the auction and hasn't paid. I messaged them 24 hours after the auction politely noting everything is packaged and ready to ship, just awaiting payment.

A few hours later they messaged asking for ""a few days"" to get their friend's address in the US because they (buyer) are based in Egypt. What's troubling is the zero feedback profile since 2016. They do have a known re-shipping address listed (googled the 'Print Shipping Label' address) , but again, I haven't received their payment and thus haven't done any shipping yet.

My questions are really, should I bother waiting a few more days before filing a UID? Also, they admitted that they will re-ship through a ""friend"".

Ebay,eBay's hold policy makes it very risky to sell on their platform.,"I'm a casual seller on eBay. I've sold approx. 20 items and I've got 100% positive feedback - I've also bought hundreds of things from eBay without a hiccup.   


I was advertising my PC and a Scuf Playstation controller that I don't use anymore on eBay - the PC sold for $800\~ and the controller for $200\~. I see the notification that it sold, and started to make my way to the post office to get labels done and proper packaging. When I got there, I noticed that PayPal hadn't sent me a notification indicating I've been paid, so I checked my paypal balance and noticed that the money was being held. I called eBay from my vehicle and they explained to me that because I'm a ""casual seller"" that they're holding the money on this purchase until the item is shipped. I was okay with this, because if they're releasing the funds after it's shipped than it's mostly just precautionary to make sure I actually have the items in question. They then told me that they would release the hold THREE BUSINESS DAYS AFTER DELIVERY(!!!) and only IF the BUYER had no complaints. That worried me. I called PayPal who told me they would release the funds ONE BUSINESS DAY after eBay releases them, and cautioned me that after I ship the item, it's very possible for the buyer to initiate a charge back and I could lose the funds AND MY ITEM. Now I'm super super worried. I understand protection for the buyer, but what about protection for me? Why am I expected to allow someone to use the Item's I'm selling them for THREE BUSINESS DAYS before deciding if they want to pay for them or not? I offered full refund within 30 days if the item wasn't performing at the levels specified OR if they buyer just wasn't happy with them. eBay makes it impossible for ""Casual Sellers"" or NEW SELLERS to start on their platform. You're asking me to send $1,000 worth of merchandise off to someone in another country and waiting three business days AFTER delivery (at the absolute BEST, if the customer has a complaint it could be up to 21 business days after delivery and that's IF I ever even get paid for the items)  to receive payment. That's time that the customer could be beating up my items, stripping my items for parts or doing a countless number of other things to them to absolutely make them worthless, with me having no security at all.   


This isn't right. Sellers need protection as well, and this hold policy absolutely cripples the ability for us to sell any item over $50 on this platform.",11,2,2019-12-14,EBAY,0.06747537851333618,0.905225396156311,0.027299167588353157

Ebay,Just a reminder that not everyone evil and there is hope for humanity,"Awhile back I bought an item and was waiting for it to ship but it never did. I contacted the seller to ask if he shipped the item yet and he/she responded that they didn't receive my payment. He came to the conclusion that his old PayPal was connected to his eBay account and asked if I could send the money to his current account and that I should try to cancel the payment. I couldn't cancel the payment but I sent money to his current PayPal (I was naive and trusting, I know better now.) The money I sent to his old account stayed there for quite a while and I just ignored the fact I was short that money. But recently I was checking my PayPal and found money sent to me via PayPal from his old account. He accepted the payment and sent it right back to me, he must have found his way back into his old account. This whole encounter made me feel good about humanity and I just thought I would share this here. He could have easily just taken my money but he didn't.

Ebay,What does this mean: Item delivered 'by Agent to Merchant',"I've ordered something for the first time on eBay on 7th December. I live in India and the seller is from NY. The seller shipped it through USPS First Class Mail International on the same day. The estimated delivery date was between 9-33 days after shipping, however, yesterday when I tracked the package on eBay, it was delivered on 12th December (just 5 days later) with a delivery message- Delivered by Agent to Merchant. The package location is REEDSBURG , WI. The tracking on the USPS website says the same. When I messaged the seller about this, he said that he would go to the post office and check and also that Reedsburg is likely the place where it will be forwarded to international mail from. He hasn't replied me yet, but I've started to become a little skeptical about this, or maybe it's because it's my first time on eBay.

When is the right time bring eBay in, to investigate this? I think this could be a fraud. Help me.

Ebay,This will be an unpopular opinion...,"I really like this community. You are all very helpful towards buyers and sellers, which is great!

I've noticed most people here are sellers, with the random buyer (like myself) coming in to ask the odd question, and I've also noticed that most sellers complain how unfair and biased eBay is, always leaning to the buyers side. While I don't dispute that, I have to say that imho it's the only way it can be...

As an honest buyer, if it wasn't for the certainty that if anything goes wrong I'll get my money back, I wouldn't use the platform at all! This guarantee is what makes me split most of my online shopping habits between eBay and Amazon (which also works well for returns/refunds). 
I know that this buyer protection leads to abuse from dishonest people, but (and correct me if I'm wrong) sellers can also minimize the damage by being careful and using insurance, tracked and signed postage, etc., although that might cost a share of the profits.

If eBay was more ""pro seller"" in the disputes I feel like there would be a lot of scammers taking advantage of that and in no time the platform would be wrecked because without buyers... You know...

Like I said, I think of myself as an honest person and I had to open quite a few disputes already because of not so scrupulous sellers, all of which I won. To be fair, I don't think I ever had an issue with anything I've bought from a ""professional"" seller, it seems to always happen with the casual person that randomly sells some stuff on eBay and doesn't seem to be guided by the same standards as a professional would. And this is why I think eBay needs to stand on the buyer's side, as the majority of sales seem to come from random people, a lot of them with dubious moral standards that would try to make some easy money if the opportunity would arise. 

Anyway, just wanted to get that off my chest. Thanks for being this awesome community and best of luck with the sales/purchases!!",95,65,2019-12-16,EBAY,0.07586981356143951,0.8882030844688416,0.03592713922262192

Ebay,Seller demanding more $ or they will relist auction I had won days earlier,"So last night a seller for an auction I had won emailed me saying they miscalculated the shipping and wanted an extra $15 that night or else they would cancel the auction and relist it for the ""correct"" price the next day. 


I told them that I would not accept a cancelation for this reason and wanted them to mail the items I had won as it was not my fault they had set the shipping to that price. The new price would have made it total almost $80 (the final bid before shipping was $50). Also stated that if they cancel the order for this reason I will contact eBay to have a strike set against their account. 

Today they said because of my negativity they are refunding my order and relisting it. Looked at the cancelation order and they said the reason was for ""out of stock or damaged""

I'm just wondering what are my options for reporting this seller to eBay and how I should point out to other buyers to avoid this seller. (Feedback looks like to be my only option but I'm still locked from writing a negative feedback for a few days while they are able to relist the items before people can see my message)


Sorry if my post didn't make sense. Just annoyed that I have to deal with finding new Christmas gifts and somehow get them shipped here in time.

So I can't file a paypal claim, it leads me to the eBay resolution center.  The seller then tried to cancel the order, and as of now the cancellation is pending.  My only options there are I didn't pay for the order or I did and got a refund.  Neither of which is true.

how do I approach this situation? is there a way I can buy it from them and then submit a complaint to ebay? I know its mine... I literally had this ugly coffee stain on it that ive been meaning to clean, and it's pretty evident in the pic they posted.

Ebay,"3 day selling ban for ""damaged boxes"" (rant)","So I came into a big lot of kids probiotics, sealed and unexpired. They expire in January and I started selling them in November. Because they're so close dated I've been selling them well below retail, which is around 2 boxes for the retail price of 1. I was originally selling them in a lot of 4 for the price of 1.5, but that listing was quickly taken down because the ebay prescription drug policy does not allow damaged boxes. Ok, fine I guess, [but I don't consider one creased corner of 1 box to be that damaged](https://imgur.com/GFZafLh). I had other pictures of the lot number and expiration that back up that these were not crush or ripped boxes and also not expired, maybe just some shelf wear. I asked the ebay for business facebook page for advice where the guy told me they were indeed taken down for damage and not to relist. It's clear if the box even has normal shelf wear, you can't list it? Ok. I got these cheap enough that I culled every single box that was not shelf perfect and relisted in 2 packs with a higher price. Nope, taken down again after selling one and this time a 3 day selling restriction came with it, which means my items will not show up in search for 3 days. [Here are my ""damaged"" boxes.](https://imgur.com/TZtaHEJ)

What irritates me is most people selling them are hiding behind a stock photo anyway so why am I being targeted? You can't prove they're NOT selling crushed boxes so why even allow stock photos? I can only think Culturelle themselves or a competitor don't like me selling them so cheap. It's cool they can just nuke you for ""damaged boxes"" even when they look no more damaged then retail boxes. So I guess the point of this rant is has anyone ever had this happen them and also a warning to stay away from medications, even non prescription stuff. Someone will find a way to slap you down.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Got the decision reversed, but after being told there was damage to the corners and that's why they were taken down (which is basically a lie because that's not real damage that's literally how they come out of a case) I asked what about stock photos?

Ebay,"Fellow eBay sellers, how do you go about reporting your eBay income and expenses for taxes?","First quarter taking eBay seriously. It's currently my full time income. I'm wondering how to report my activity. I know there are tax reporting softwares out there. I'm looking for both the most efficient way long-term after this quarter and how I can do it this quarter having not used any tax reporting software or having done any book keeping myself. 

For this quarter, do I just get a copy of Quicken or something like that and go through all of my expenses and sales and log each one for the past few months from my eBay history/ credit card statements, or is there an easier way rather than picking it all out one by one such as using eBay's seller hub to be able to see everything all at once and just going by those numbers? I plan on consulting a CPA soon, but I want to go in prepared on my part with everything I should have.

For the following quarters, I've heard of people using Intuit QuickBooks. I have 6 months of it free from Amazon Prime business. How does that work? Are there better time-efficient ways of tracking everything for taxes than this?

I hope this is an ok sub to ask this.

Ebay,Taxes on used items?,"As far as I know, most states do not have a tax on used items. Most states are smart enough to know when a law would be totally unenforceable. But it seems that ebay has started collecting tax on pretty much everything. Even just old used junk that states just don't collect taxes on. Yet you have to give ebay some tax money. I live in Texas, if I buy a used item from my neighbor, there's no tax due to the state. Most states are this way, if not all of them.

Ebay,No more eChecks for eBay refunds through PayPal,"We don't keep funds in PayPal any longer than need be. This usually resulted in any refunds we issued as being done via eCheck. 

Found out yesterday that is no longer an option. You now have to have funds in PayPal to cover an eBay refund when you go to issue it. 

eBay didn't know about this... took three reps before I found one that had ""heard something about people having to transfer money into PayPal to issue a refund"".  So I called PayPal and they confirmed this: Due to the divorce between eBay and PayPal, we are now expected to have funds in our PayPal account to cover a refund before we can issue one. 

I strongly suggested that PayPal and eBay make that clear to people. Also strongly urged PayPal to come up with a faster way to transfer money into an account if this is the way now.

Ebay,Should I leave negative feedback against a seller who cancelled an order because the bid wasn't high enough?,"I've searched through this section and couldn't find a response to this predicament that I'm sure other buyers have faced: Seller cancels an order as soon as the auction ends since the highest bid wasn't to the seller's satisfaction.

What happened:   
This has happened to me a few times this year, but last night, I was bidding on a watch that I already made an offer of USD 300 for, and the seller sent me a counter offer of 350 which I refused. I was in touch with the seller and he sent me more photos of the condition too. The seller did message saying he would not sell it for less than 350. Once bidding started on it, I managed to be the highest bidder at 300 (my desired price) and won the auction (I didn't do last minute bids, I had bid my highest bid 5 hours before the auction ended). 1.5 hours later after winning it, he cancels the order and eBay emails me saying ""The seller canceled this order due to the following reason: I'm out of stock or the item is damaged. You don't need to do anything else."".

Ebay,Tired of buyers threatening me with bad feedback and demanding refunds,"Just to clear this up, this is my Nan’s account, she values her feedback more than her own life in my opinion. I didn’t think it was a big deal until I started running the account for her, until recently I’ve had several buyers in the past few days threaten me with leaving bad feedback. 

Buyer 1 - I sold a COMPLETE set of Lego. Still in its box and in the sealed plastic bags, the second she bought the item she sent a message saying, “I hope all the pieces are there, I’d hate to leave negative feedback and ask for a FULL refund”. How was this necessary, I don’t understand the point of her sending this message at all?

Buyer 2 - claimed item hasn’t arrived and wanted a full refund, I told him I’d tracked it to his local sorting office using the tracking number I had provided on eBay, as he wasn’t in to sign for it. He then opened a case against me saying the item hasn’t arrived... he just needs to collect it, get this, four minutes from his chosen address. 

Buyer 3 - buyer bought something through the global shipping program, ten minutes later threatened to leave negative feedback because they’re being charged £11 customs fee. Both parties are in the EU so I don’t understand why they’re paying customs. 

Buyer 4 - buyer opened a refund request saying the item has not arrived, this item is in fact at her local sorting office as shown by the tracking number provided. I don’t want to give her a refund because I’ve sent the parcel signed for, if I refund her she’ll have the parcel AND a refund. 

I’m getting really tired of people being this way, and I know there’s no point even trying to fight it because eBay will take the buyers side. 

Does anybody have any advice on how to handle these sorts of people? Will eBay take my side with people like buyer 2 and buyer 4? I don’t want to give a refund when I know the item is at their local office, because they could get a refund and simply go pick up the parcel and have the item for free?!",10,4,2019-12-20,EBAY,0.06541013717651367,0.9003953337669373,0.034194476902484894

Ebay,International Buyer Red Flag?,"I decided to test out the new eBay sneaker promotion with no seller fees and listed a pair of shoes today.

It was purchased and paid for a couple hours later by a eBay member with over 600+ positive feedback (100% positive feedback). I thought this would be a smooth transaction but then I noticed a couple of red flags. 

My fees after PayPal processed were higher than the expected 2.9% + $.30. I contacted PayPal and they told me this is because the buyer is paying from an international method. The eBay member is based in Indonesia and his contact name on eBay is completely different from the name on the shipping address. The shipping address for the item is to a hotel in the United States. I have never shipped to a hotel before so this is strange. The address is literally phrased like:

* Buyer's First Middle Last Name (arrive on 12/26)
* Name of Hotel
* Address
* Washington DC

Ebay,eBay Return - buyer “unable” to print return label &amp; eBay has asked me to provide one instead?,"Hi there! I recently sold a winter jacket on eBay. Upon receiving the jacket, the buyer sent me a message telling me that the inner lining on the sleeve is ripped out (which I’m almost positive was NOT the case when I shipped it out - but that is besides the point) and told me I need to issue them a full refund. 
I promptly apologized for any inconvenience and urged the buyer to submit a return request &amp; send the jacket back, so I can issue the refund as soon as the item is received. It took the buyer a couple of days to respond to this message - so my original thought was that they may be trying to get a refund for the jacket, without actually sending it back. But she did eventually submit the return request, and it was automatically approved by eBay, so I’ve just been waiting to receive the return.

When I went to check on the status today, it says that the return was closed &amp; buyer opened a case against me. Called eBay and they say that the seller was unable to print a shipping label at home, so they need me to provide a pre-paid label for this buyer or send them money via PayPal, so they can purchase a return label themselves. Customer service called it a “glitch” in their system. 

Has this ever happened to anyone, what did you do? I wanted to send the buyer a pre-paid label instead of just sending them money for it, because this seems sketchy to me. What if they just never return it and keep the money for the label? 

Purchasing pre-paid shipping via USPS requires that I select a shipping date. What happens if the buyer doesn’t ship it out on the date that I purchased postage for? Would I have to continuously void and re-create labels until she can get it sent out? Does any of this make sense?

Ebay,"Buyer blatantly admits that my product is working fine, eBay still sided with them","I sold a PlayStation 4 and the buyer received it a few days ago. Today they open a case against me saying that the PlayStation 4 doesn't work with *their* controller (When I included 2 at that) and they want to return it. In the details they sent me, they straight up said ""The PlayStation itself is working fine, however it doesn't work with the extra controller I already owned. The controllers you included also work, so I don't understand why mine isn't working with it. I want to return this because the PlayStation is not working as intended"". 


I asked them what controller they're using, and after they told me I immediately realized that it's some 3rd party bullshit that isn't even made OR licensed by Sony. Regardless, eBay still sides with them because they called and told a rep (After I told them no on the return because it's THEIR product that isn't working, not mine) PlayStations should work with all PlayStation controllers and mine doesn't, therefore it's faulty. And now, on top of the $30 I paid to have the package expedited to them so it could arrive before Christmas, I have to spend another $20+ on a shipping label so they can send the product back.

Ebay,Sent a question to a seller and was immediately blocked. I want to know what I did wrong so I can improve on being a better buyer.,"So earlier this month I was looking at buying some arcade flyers from a seller in America (I'm in the UK for context) and I sent them a question as follows:

""Hi there. Interested in some of your flyers but was wondering how you mark the value of items through customs?

Do you mark the items in USD or do you mark them in the currency of the country the items are going to?""

I asked this as one item I was interested in was about £14.90 converted from USD, but the conversion rates had at the time been quite unstable and I wanted to know if I would have the risk of paying extra on the item through import charges or not, as anything £15 or over is subject to an £8 handling fee and import charge. If the seller marked in £ I would not be charged however if they marked in $ I would have the risk of being faced with about £12 extra in import charges due to fluctuating conversion rates at the time.

Looking for some advice on what I did wrong here, self reflection is kinda hard for me so having someone else point out my mistakes would be great to help me improve.

Ebay,Buyer leaves bad feedback after no pay for 12 days.,"A buyer, and i use the term loosely after they never paid left negative feedback for me.  Mind you I have 600+ 100% reviews since 2001 and have done over $200k in sales.

I had a sense early this user was an issue, they sent an offer of less than 30% my asking price which I declined, they immediately sent an offer for half my asking price.  Declined that offer again, no reply I didn’t want to be rude.  At the last second the user popped up in the auction activity stealing the bid from 2 other users.  Mind you this was the week before Christmas so I could use the funds and the other users may have been gifting the item.  

A day goes by no response from buyer/user so I sent a second invoice, and stated “the item is all packed up and ready to ship upon payment confirmation.  Time is tight but Holiday delivery may still be possible at no additional costs.”

2 days go by and I send a similar message but relate that all shipping guarantees are off with the busy season.  Still no reply or communications from the user/buyer.  I have an automatic feature that starts a no pay dispute after 10 days.  I logged in this morning to see if they had paid, they had not.  They even took the time to leave the only negative feedback in my 18 years on eBay.  Saying I was “slow to ship and a bad seller”? 

Regardless after 20 minutes navigating eBays atrocious user menus and completing a no pay report, having to submit for fee refunds and generally jump through hoops.  The feedback was removed seeing that the buyer(?) never bought the item.  
That being said, I have spent easily 2 hours of my time undoing what a buyer did, there should be no way that a buyer can tie up a seller having never paid yet.  Let alone have access to leave feedback without ever completing a transaction.

Ebay,What’s your craziest story of a buyer showing up at your door? This is mine.,"Back when I first registered as a business seller, eBay had to display a business address I used because under EU law you have to. I was renting a mail box at the time so I used that address instead of my house address (Yes technically I was breaking the rules but I was not putting my house address online).

Anyway, one day I receive a message via eBay from someone asking to view a watch I was selling. I did not want to meet them so I told them I didn’t have the correct insurance -which was true- so they could not view it in person. 

The mail box address was something like “mailbox 13, storage center, industrial estate”. It was clearly just a mail box and not a business premises. Well I get home from work the next day, log into eBay and I have a message from the same person saying they have driven down to the mail box to be told by staff I’m not there. At this point I blocked them and ignored their messages.

This has we wondering who is the craziest/most annoying person that has ever shown up at your house without permission thinking they can view your eBay items?",26,29,2019-12-27,EBAY,0.06743154674768448,0.90621018409729,0.0263583455234766

Ebay,UK seller didn’t mention they were dispatching from France...,"I bought an item from a seller located in the UK, whose profile said they dispatch by Royal Mail First Class within 2 working days of receiving payment. (I am in the UK so this was a reasonably safe bet even with Xmas delays.)

I paid for the item (lightweight silk dress) immediately, at noon on the 17th. Postage charge seemed pretty exorbitant (£9.50, at least twice as much as usual) but I really wanted the item and hoped to get it before Xmas. They said they would send it on the Friday (20th) with a tracked and recorded service.

On the 19th they messaged me asking for my phone number and saying they would send “as soon as” they had it.

eBay’s tracking finally shows the dress as dispatched on the 23rd as Colissimo from France. It was put in the system to be sent to the UK on the 24th. It’s still in France waiting for transit to the UK.

According to Colissimo tracking the official delivery date is today but the most probable delivery date is 6-10 Jan.

Messaged the seller and said sorry, they are at their holiday home in France and didn’t realize I wanted it before Xmas.

Now of course if I had been hell bent on getting it before Xmas I would have put “time is of the essence” but that is not my main point here. I didn’t realize they were sending it from France as they never indicated anything such on their profile, and it’s not clear whether strike action is affecting this or not. Furthermore they kept saying they were about to send it on the 19th or 20th and then didn’t do so until the 23rd. 

tl:dr seller charged unusually high postage fee, dragged out the dispatch date, and didn’t mention they were sending from abroad.

Do I have any recourse here given that the system does show the item as shipped?",14,5,2019-12-28,EBAY,0.07538959383964539,0.8919642567634583,0.032646115869283676

Ebay,I won an eBay chargeback!,"[https://imgur.com/3d4PU87](https://imgur.com/3d4PU87)

I've heard so many horror stories of people saying you can't do jack and the buyer's credit card CO will side with them 99.9% of the time. But it looks like I was either lucky or just did all the right things.

**Back story:**

Buyer purchased item from me and messaged me saying it arrived damaged and didn't work right, but he wasn't interested in returning it and asked for a partial refund. I partial refunded him $15 and he happily accepted. The next day he messaged me again asking for more and threatened me with negative feedback. I told him he can return the item free for a refund, to which he just told me off and said to forget about it.

A week later I get an email saying this buyer opened a chargeback with his financial institution. I asked a lot of people here and on the PayPal sub about chargebacks and they all basically said I was screwed.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I did:**

I called PayPal and was lucky enough to get the best representative in the world who legitimately sympathized with me and recommended I take screenshots of the eBay messages and file an IC3 report on [IC3.gov](https://IC3.gov), and then upload that to PayPal so they can send it to the buyer's credit card company. I did just that, and another rep emailed me saying ""I provided far more information than most sellers do."" Now, three months later, I get this email saying I won the chargeback and got my money back. Also, the Buyer's account was banned from eBay.

Something feels off about thus and could use some advice on how I should approach this  situation.",8,3,2019-12-31,EBAY,0.026340598240494728,0.9119647145271301,0.06169473007321358
