Ebay,Buyer Threatened Negative Feedback - Would It Count as Feedback Extortion?,"I know a lot of you have mentioned as soon as a buyer threatens to leave negative feedback in their message, you've been protected from said feedback if it happened.

We sold a pre-owned crossbow. I've sold them for years and though I don't use them myself, over time I've learned what to look for regarding wear and tear and how to take the best photos / write the best description. Buyer receives it and sends this message:

falling apart-- junk-- taped everywhere scope bent string shot-- quiver falls off-- what r u going to do to make this right so no bad feedback/ return--- send a dozen bolts with broadheads

The bow absolutely was not and is not in this condition. That's just ridiculous. I'm used to crap like this, however usually the buyer is sneaky and doesn't mention feedback. This time I'm actually not sure if this already qualifies as feedback extortion or not. Thoughts?

I'm going to give him the usual courteous response: ""You may certainly return the bow for a full refund"". We always gladly accept returns if the customer is unsatisfied. If he's not shitty we might even reimburse him for return shipping (I realize we'll be forced to by eBay soon). 

My instinct is to just do what I was going to do - offer the return for a full refund and see where it goes from there. If he leaves negative feedback for us not just giving him a full refund without return (likely what he's going to ask for) does it look like we have a shot at feedback extortion with his statement? Thanks.


**UPDATE: Ok, I just had to add this part. I couldn't help but laugh out loud when I sent my response and got his next reply.**

My response to his initial message:

&gt;Good evening,

&gt;We are sorry to hear that you are unhappy with the bow. Please note that in our description we did address the issue of the duct tape and quiver, as well as showed it in our photos.

&gt;We will absolutely accept a return for a full refund. Since you have stated that there are many issues with the bow, we will offer to cover the cost of return shipping and provide a label to you via e-mail or we can mail a physical copy to you. Please let us know which you would prefer.

&gt;We apologize again for the inconvenience. Thank you for contacting us and giving us the opportunity to work with you.

His reply:

&gt;what a shit answer. all you had to do to rectify the crap you sold was to offer a few arrows. You have 14 hrs till fry time on ebay",9,9,2014-09-01,EBAY,0.08344221860170364,0.8881666660308838,0.028391119092702866
Ebay,"eBay banned me from selling, advice would be appreciated.","I recently broke up with my girlfriend (nearly 2 months ago). We lived together and ran an eBay business together that was okay.

After the break up, I wanted nothing more to do with the business. Everything was handed over, I let her deal with it, and went on my merry way happier than I have been for a while.

Anyway, I come to eBay, I enjoy using it, it's fun and I have a few collectibles of my own that I want to sell and get money back for, so I open a new account. All is smooth.

I head over to the selling page, spend a few minutes setting up the listing and BOOM. ""Sorry you have been restricted to 0 listings per month due to the associated account [one of ex girlfriends accounts] having issues""

So I contact ebay and ask what the deal is. They say there is an issue with [exes account] and that I am restricted because our accounts are linked.

I ask how this link can be severed as we have in real life... It cannot be severed apparently.

I ask what the issues are with this associated account, so I may take steps to try and resolve them. ""We cannot say due to privacy issues.""



So now I'm stuck. I want to use eBay fully, I have no other accounts, but can't because eBay says I once went out with a girl who has an ebay account herself...

Help?



EDIT: 2/9/14 - *PERSISTENCE PAYS*

After contacting them several times, they have changed their minds, or I have for the first time spoken to a sensible representative. She understood the situation, and allowed me to list items, but only a limited number of 5 this first month (which is all I need for now really!)

Ebay,Is asking for feedback always a bad idea?,"I'm in the process of getting my ebay business off the ground, and so far I'm at 17 feedback, 100% positive.

Obviously, I can't expect everyone to leave feedback, but there's one buyer who won an auction of mine for a rare piece of art -- it sold for a sizeable chunk of change. 

He communicated with me via message, thanked me for the positive experience and for packing the art so well and shipping it so promptly. We exchanged another message afterwards, because he was curious if I would be selling any more art any time soon.

Anyway, he never left feedback. I imagine his positive feedback in particular would be valuable, because potential bidders could see that I've delivered good service when selling very expensive items as well.

Should I politely request that he leave feedback? I haven't asked because I'm still a new user and paranoid about receiving negatives. Is it too risky to ask for feedback? Is it considered rude? Should I just be content that the transaction went swimmingly and drop it? I'm almost positive he just forgot and would leave positive feedback, but obviously there's no way to be sure.

Getting to the point, just yesterday, I messaged him through eBay asking what the material was, just so I would know what to expect. He responded, but said he wanted to ""continue the question in private email"".

Ebay,Buyer opened a case because my tablet was making her computer slow... And won.,"Quick recap of events:

* Buyer buys my used Wacom Intuos 3. Has a fault along the top, that I discuss at length with the buyer, and she is happy with it.
* Ship my tablet to her at £12, with the buyer paying £6.
* Buyer complains that the tablet is too slow, I tell her that is no fault of the tablet, and can only be her computer. Try to help her optimise her computer for free.
* Buyer then suddenly says there's deep, deep scratches on the tablet.
* Any scratches, if existent, would be on the protective, 1mm thick replaceable plastic protective cover.
* I tested out the tablet before shipping and drew pictures.
* Buyer refuses to listen to any advice, opens up a case and wins instantly.

I have no money in my bank, so this'll send me £100 into my overdraft, depending on what card ebay steals my money from, this can cost me £10 for every day I'm not in the black.

So I'm paying out my bum hole because a buyer's computer was too slow.


What are my options here? Ebay gives no option to appeal their decision to automatically appease the buyer. I was thinking I'd just call up my bank (Lloyds TSB) and ask them to reverse the charges, since I never agreed to them.

At this point, I don't care if my Ebay account gets deleted, I never want to sell or buy on there and support them and their Paypal again.

Any help would be super appreciated. Thanks!",20,12,2014-09-02,EBAY,0.033189572393894196,0.923024594783783,0.04378579184412956

Dear ussiya_eybexns (my email),

We've noticed you've exceeded your monthly selling limits. Because of this, your most recently listed unsold items have been removed and all associated fees have been credited to your account. Selling limits are put in place to help you establish a positive selling history and provide excellent service to your customers.

The removed listings will be available in your ""Unsold Items"" section in My eBay. You can relist these items by adjusting your current inventory. 


Afterwards, I sort of panic and rush to close my account. However, I forgot to remove all of my personal information (address, phone number, credit card number) from my account before I closed it. Has this happened to anyone else? Should I be worried?

tl;dr I'm a noob at eBay and some weird things happened

Ebay,New phone I bought on eBay for $600 in May became blacklisted due to non payment today,"I bought a Sealed Brand New T-Mobile Galaxy S5 on ebay on May 6th 2014, everything was working fine until today, when all of a sudden I realized I don't have service, so I tried toggling airplane mode and rebooting the phone, and nothing worked, so I called T-Mobile and they said that the person who sold me the phone, financed it, and stopped paying so they blocked the phone.
Now it's too late to open a case on ebay or Paypal since its 4 months after my purchase, and I tried looking up his account to see if anyone else had the same problem as me, but his account does not exist anymore...

Ebay,"As a seller, I am appalled by eBay's seller protection, maybe you can relate... (x-post r/eBaySucks)","I believe this post belongs here. I am not trying to make this a rant but a story in which I would like to have known what I, as a seller, could have done differently, which is my question to this subreddit. I revised the original removing vulgarity and I am not posting any information on the buyer.

So, about 3 months ago, I sold 2 tennis rackets on eBay for $50 a pop and sent to the buyer in a jiffy and all was good in life. He got 2 tennis rackets and I got money for my old school discontinued TI radicals (may their new master treat them well). Anyway, I described the rackets to be 4 1/2 grip size but apparently one of them was smaller. It was my error and he opened an eBay resolution case in which I gladly accepted the resolution. Now from this point, I waited to receive the tennis rackets and eBay noted ""Do not pay the buyer until you have received the item"", which I followed. I received just ONE of the two tennis rackets back within the week and contacted eBay about it. By now though, eBay without my permission, issued the full refund back to the buyer through PayPal. The representative I spoke to told me that the buyer will probably send the 2nd racket back in another shipment, so I waited. Another week passed and I contacted eBay as well as the seller to determine why I hadn't received the 2nd racket yet. The buyer wasn't responding. And eBay said they could do nothing since the refund was already issued. I spoke to their appeals department about some type of seller protection but they could do nothing either. They just reiterated that since the refund went through, they could not legally take the money back from the buyer. So here I am, down $50 because some douchebag in the middle of nowhere and decided to send me 1 racket back and get away with it. I called eBay back a few more times but to no avail, they repeated they could do nothing especially since the buyer was not responding. I found the buyer's phone number but he never picked up. So, in conclusion, screw that buyer and eBay's seller protection system. I should be the one manually refunding that douchebag back instead of pulling money directly from me just because there was tracking information from the buyer. I might as well have bought Albert, Texas for $2.5m (it's true look it up) and sent a bag of poo back to the seller and woopdeedoo get a full refund and own my own city in Texas. In conclusion, screw the buyer and screw eBay's crappy customer rep support (I have had good experiences too but eff this one). **How could I as a seller have done anything different in this situation?**

As a seller, I always leave feedback immediately after I ship the item, and as you would suspect the majority of my buyers don't bother to leave feedback after they receive their item.  Though some would say ""no news is good news"", but feedback plays an important role in our businesses.

On the AirB&amp;B system I noticed that in order for feedback to be shown in their profile, both parties must submit a review.  That way, if you do your job by leaving honest feedback about the other party, they will not benefit from that goodwill unless they themselves write a review.

Has anyone ever seen any mention of a system like this for eBay?  It drives me nuts when I check a buyer's feedback left for others section and there is nothing, while they are enjoying a buyer reputation with hundreds of positive responses.

Ebay,Being Forced to Upgrade from a Personal to a Business Account (eBay UK),"I'm getting married in 8 weeks and am currently selling off a large collection of records I've spent the last 20 or so years collecting (no hang ups on doing this - it's just been sat in a cupboard for the last 5 years). For the last 6 months I've been selling it off 10-15 records a week with everything made going into a savings account that's intended to be a mortgage deposit for when me and my fiancée start looking to buy our own home.


However, yesterday I received an email from eBay telling me that I must upgrade my private eBay account to a business eBay account. The message said that if I didn't upgrade to a business account by September 11th then I will no longer be allowed to sell!


My worry is that I'm not selling as a business. I'm selling a collection purely to save up for a future and I'm a little worried that if I moved to a business account Mr. Taxman is going to think I'm doing this professionally and slap a big tax bill on me. 


I've spoken to eBay and they said that it's because I've hit a private seller threshold and gave the impression that the business account is set purely for frequent sellers and gives a few added benefits. They told me that no details are passed onto HMRC for eBay accounts registered as a business.


""You don't have to be a business to have a business account"".


What do you guys think? I can't really see an option.

Ebay,Ebay account suspended with no email notification or valid reason. Can anyone help?,"I logged into my account, trying to buy something, but found out it was suspended. I called Ebay twice, and was told both times that I've violated the ""daily deal"" policy. 

However: 

1) I have NEVER purchased anything from ""daily deal"", which is verified by the two people I spoke with on the phone;

2) I have not received any email notification from Ebay to tell me my account got suspended (I checked my inbox on Ebay website), which is also verified by the people I spoke to. 

1st time when i called - the person on the phone was equally surprised and confused, and promised to investigate and call back in 48 hrs (which didn't happen)

2nd time when I called - the person on the phone said it was a permanent decision and was just repeating the same thing without giving a solid reason (violating ""daily deal"" policy by not buying anything from daily deal?!!!); Demanded to speak to a supervisor after 45 min... Supervisor was confused about the situation and said she would investigate and respond in 48 hrs. Still, no call back/email from Ebay. 


Has similar thing happened to anyone else? I am not a regular Ebay user (~20 transactions in 6 yrs, mostly purchase). Any suggestion what to do? Thank you so much! 





UPDATE: 

I just did a third call and got the ""real reason"" of my account suspension (but no less confusing):

My current account got suspended because they just linked my current account with my old account (several years ago). The old account was blocked NOT because of any activity, NOT because of any personal information, but because of the account itself. I have no idea what it means, and they are not allowed to provide any further information. I was ensured I did nothing wrong, nothing illegal, but I will never be able to use Ebay.

Here is some additional information for those that are interested: - My old account had ~10 transactions, and 9 of them were purchases; - I created this current account when I found out i couldn't log into my old account (should have tried to figure out why then... apparently because it was blocked) - I still have not received any email notification from Ebay. The last representative mentioned they were not allowed to write me anything...

I don't care that much about using Ebay since I don't use it often, but I really wanted an answer, and felt frustrated and angry that I had to try very hard to squeeze any word out of them (if my account is the problem, shouldn't I at least know why?!)",8,3,2014-09-05,EBAY,0.32465866208076477,0.6525004506111145,0.022840874269604683
Ebay,Is it worth it to open an unpaid item case?,"Here's the deal. Sold a collectible mug recently on ebay. Towards the end, there's a bit of a bidding war. The person who wins the auction is new, and has 0 feedback. I currently have approximately 30 feedback at 100% (and this early in the game I'd really like to keep it at 100%). 



They won the auction on 9/2 (3 days ago). They still haven't paid, and this morning I get this message (verbatim):



""I apologize, I found a larger mug for a cheaper price shortly after I discovered I won this item. Please sell to second highest bidder or relist this item. I am sorry for any inconvenience.""



My gut tells me to open an unpaid item case. Yes, they're a relatively new user, but they are obviously aware of how bidding works, and just don't care. Sending a message 3 days later? Come on. The content of the message is just insulting to me. Just make up an excuse, for all I care. Had they said ""sorry, I just realized my account is overdrawn and I can't pay, I'm so sorry, please don't open an unpaid item case, you can relist it if you need to!"" Then I would've been like ""no prob! Yer all good!"" But the message they DID send might as well have said ""I know I agreed to pay for your item, but I decided afterwards that it wasn't very cool and it wasn't cheap enough""



For all I know, they could' ve done this in the past, and slipped through my strict bidding requirements because other sellers didn't open a case.



Here's my fear: I open an unpaid item case, the buyer pays, then leaves negative feedback. How likely is it? Should I just let it go? I don't actually care about the money, it's easy to relist, it's just the principle that bugs me so much. And I want to spare other sellers from having to deal with a fickle user who thinks it's fine to just not pay.



But I also reaaaally don't want negative feedback.

I'm selling an item that is so far up to $350 but could go far past that, and I'm a little worried that because of the price and/or worldwide shipping, I might get screwed over by a buyer saying they either didn't receive the item, or saying it 'didn't work' so they could get their money back and resell it.

Ebay,Need an Opinion,"So I sold a pair of shoes like 3-4 weeks ago. I just had a buyer open a case against me stating that ""I know I purchased these used and that you provided pictures but after 3 weeks of wearing them the soles have come apart."" Going so far as as to state ""these shoes had either defective soles which wasn't listed or the soles had separated and were reglued for sale""

I didn't mention the glue cause I bought them used myself and they were like that when I got them. (after looking at the pictures I took I can see what appears to be glue around the soles.) 

They of course want a full refund and I don't think I'm against that yet even though it will end up being a nice chunk I'll be missing.

So what are my best options? 

0.refund her in full no questions asked and be out the $ and hope they don't leave bad feedback 

2. Ask her to provide proof of this problem and provided she does give her a full refund

3. ask that they send the item back (even damaged) and give a full refund

4. offer a partial refund since they were able to get 3 weeks of use out of them and of course are at this point useless to me and hope they don't give bad feedback.

5. tell them they shouldn't expect perfect shoes when buying used which they state that they knew and looked at all the pictures (which i also instructed them to do in the listing) and let ebay decided who wins the case.

What do you guys think? I don't think my ebay can take another negative but I also don't want to let this person just walk away with my shoes and my $.

Do you guys think I can win my case or am I screwed and should just refund her no questions asked?",0,1,2014-09-06,EBAY,0.06404419243335724,0.9071434736251831,0.028812309727072716

I call up ebay support today and after hour and a half of holds and transfers i get told.  ""since the item was not delivered within the estimated shipping time you are receiving a defect""

I go did you read the message stating it was the post offices fault?  she goes yes she did but i am still receiving a defect.

Ebay,What the chance I would win in this situation? And could I have done more in my listing?,"Before I begin, just want to say I'm pretty much going to cave to their demands because I can't afford any neg or hits against my account since I have little feedback and I'm currently spotless as far as my perfomance goes.  The price it paid for the item is so little I'm not to worried about losing money.
  
Pretty much I sold a metronome I bought from a yard sale.  It was in decent condition.  Explained that there are significant scratches and wear on the sides but it works well.  I failed to mention there was no cover for the device mainly because I didn't know they had covers.  Yet I took plenty of pictures of the product and it's clear there was no cover to it.  
  
He messaged me literally 15 mins ago saying he's not happy I didn't mention it came with a cover.  He even says I took plenty of pictures but I as the seller I should have mentioned the missing cover.  Half of me agrees that I should have probably done some research before listing and saw it was supposed to have a cover.  Then again, I just listed something as-is from a yard sale.  Anyway, I messaged him back, apologized and asked him what he thinks a fair price is and will refund whatever he asks.  I'm sure he's not a scammer because he has a ton of positive feedback.  Even a buyer can't get that much positive while being a scammer.  
  
That all said, I turn to you more experienced sellers for some advice and thoughts on this issue so I can learn from this experience.  Should I have done more in my listing?  If I were to hypothetically fight this, what are my chances of winning?  
  
EDIT:  Resolution so far.  He messaged me and asked for about half off the price.  I gave it to him considering I'm still making money on the transaction as whole and I was initially prepared to take a full hit.  So far, no neg and no case has showed up.

To top it off, whether customers are happy or not, closed or not by yourself, no matter what happens as long as a case has OPENED, the seller is punished. I think the real message is THIS: 

*Once a stupid customer opens a meaningless case, eBay wants us to 100% ignore them and have nothing to do with them, and treat all other customers with 100% priority and not 1% less, since the outcome is the same whether they are happy or not after a case is closed -- that is, the seller is PUNISHED, black+white*

There is really only 3 words to say in regards to this.. and that is:

WHAT THE F#$! ????

And that is all. Thoughts, comments, warm fuzzy feelings here, come one come all, misery loves company.. tell us your story. Cry with us. Ask WHY with us..... 

Anyone know of a giant petition or something floating around the internet about this?",18,26,2014-09-10,EBAY,0.044978734105825424,0.9239266514778137,0.031094608828425407

Ebay,"Seriously, how is ebay not doing anything about this powerseller?","So I'm sure many of you saw on the daily deal a person selling rayban wayfarers and aviators for $69.99.  I bought a pair of wayfarers on friday without second guessing.  I figured end of the summer so the person is just liquidating their inventory.

The person provided me with a tracking number the next day which still hasn't been updated.  Sent an email asking whats up since I need them for this weekend, but still no response back.

Decided to take  a look at his feedback and lots of complaints saying he is selling fake raybans.  

How is ebay not investigating them and or getting rayban involved?

Ebay,Thank you /r/Ebay for for your insight; it has prompted me to never sell anything on eBay,"I started collecting and modifying Nintendo GameBoys over the past couple years and it has become a lasting hobby of mine.  I decided to consider selling some of the custom GameBoys I've been building; not to start a business or to make lots of money, but to offset the costs of my hobby, share my work, and give me a reason to continue to practice my electrical work which has always been an interest of mine.

I've been an eBay **buyer** for 7+ years and always considered it as the primary medium for selling my custom builds or to downsize my collection if need be.  That is, until subscribing to /r/Ebay.  I understand that the nature of soliciting feedback through a forum like Reddit is going to garner more negative experiences than positive, but I can't believe the abundance of poor practices, poor seller support, and overall miserable situations that eBay puts sellers through.

Instead, I've taken alternative approaches by creating a subreddit to sell my GameBoys and of course leveraging Craigslist.  So far, I've had great experiences and nothing but satisfaction and gratitude from buyers.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see any reason as a small-time seller to consider eBay as a viable medium, especially when the items are as personal and sentimental to me as these custom GameBoys that I've put hours of work into.",5,2,2014-09-10,EBAY,0.04901712387800217,0.9148039817810059,0.03617892786860466

Ebay,Alternative to PayPal that's not sketchy?,"Hi --
I heard you can change merchant services instead of use PayPal. I'm sick of PayPal and their BS, so I want to change.

At first, I thought Merchant Services Inc, claiming they can be used with ebay (and maybe they can), but they seem SUPER SHADY.... all the fees look so plain and simple, but in the fine print, they charge you annually for a ""security fee"" without saying how much it is. I contacted customer support and asked , ""Oh, it's $129"". WHAT?! 

And then they charge double (way more than PayPal fees) for ""non-normal cards"". I contacted CS again since the security fee only showing in fine print, and the price only by contacting CS, I decided to ask about this as well. ""Corporate cards, international cards, and reward cards"". Oh ok, sounds normal--wait--REWARD cards? Please define.... ""Any card that rewards users with something"". In other words, 80% of the cards out there! Heck, even my DEBIT cards have rewards on them! That's most all transactions!!

I actually used them retail in 2007, so I am starting to wonder if I actually looked closely at my statements.. ugh.

&lt;/Vent&gt;

All signs that I've seen point toward this being against Ebay policy, though I'm not sure. Every item this guy is selling has this addendum, though he has 100% feedback, and a lot of it.

Ebay,Local Seller Keeps Cancelling Auctions,"Hi there.. Rather odd thing happening for me.. 

I live in a relatively small town of 16,000 people, and I like to collect video games.. so naturally, when looking on eBay, I'll sort by 'closest distance'.. I found a seller in my town so I messaged him saying hello, and spoke with him for a bit, and I asked if Local Pickup would be an option to avoid shipping costs... He said, 'ohh I don't know, im a private person, etc.' So, I figure fuck it, I'll bid anyways and if I win, I win.  This was about 3-4 months ago, and I ended up in the lead of one of his auctions, then all of a sudden, I get an email from eBay saying my bid was cancelled..' Fast forward to today, I check my email, and I get another saying the bid was cancelled. It was a factory sealed Gameboy game and the bid was at .99 which I was leading.. 

I do not understand why this seller will not sell to me! I honestly don't care that he's a ""private person"" and doesn't want to meet.. I'll gladly accept the package if he mails it.. 

What can I do about this? He has stuff I need/want but it seems when I am in the lead, the item gets cancelled magically.",18,7,2014-09-11,EBAY,0.26902732253074646,0.7083413004875183,0.022631457075476646
Ebay,Buyers that open claims and never respond?,"So i've had this happen twice with eBay as a seller, people who open claims about INAD and I communicate with them trying to work the situation out and never hear from them again.

Never heard of again. No bad feedback left for me, don't think they are an often ebay buyer since they only have 6 feedbacks. Same situation happened two months back when someone claimed they got broken items, and when i asked for pictures to file a USPS claim, never heard from. Same thing, only had 3 feedbacks.

To me this is very annoying since they count as defects- and eBay isn't ruling for my side or theirs, but because the claim was filed it is still counted against me, when in reality people are just being shady buyers trying to claim things as broken and not as they want them to be when yes, they are as described.",7,7,2014-09-11,EBAY,0.215432271361351,0.7532337307929993,0.031334031373262405

Ebay,Buyer won case that i thought was in my favor. Need advice.,"Just went through a paypal case and i'm wondering how i lost. Sold a PSU to someone and they issue was with USPS, not me.  
  

Timeline:  
- He payed for it last Sunday and left a note asked if i could mail it out as soon as possible so he could have it next week. Next week would mean the week we're in right now, correct?  
- Monday was a holiday  
- Tuesday, I drop the package off at the post office (USPS priority prepaid online through paypal)  
- Wednesday he politely asks why the tracking doesnt show anything. I tell him to be patient, sometimes they're a little slow at updating. I've actually seen packages not show any tracking until they arrive at their destination.  
- Thursday morning he asks the same and I give him the same response. and tell him I'll contact USPS to see what's up.  
- Thursday night, he totally changes his tone and accuses me of not shipping it. I tell him i'll open a case with USPS tomorrow.  
- Friday same pissed off messages calling me a liar, saying USPS priority mail usually takes less than 3 days ""why is it taking so long?"". Also saying he needed the item right now how I'm a bad seller and I refuse to help him. He also says he doesn't want it anymore. I tell him he can refuse it and he'll get a refund.  
- I also opened a case with USPS about the package and like magic the tracking starting to show up, in a totally different state nowhere near the destination. This didnt help.  
- He opens a case on Paypal Friday night saying package wasn't received.  
  
Fast forward to this Tuesday and the package is delivered and refused. So I'm thinking, ""cool, I'll win this case and refund the guy and we'll move on our way."" Nope, they close the case in his favor and give him a full refund before the package gets back to me. I got the package back but I'm still out final value fees and shipping.

The ring is silver with black diamonds. How do Australian Customs actually know how much it's worth?

**Update (8:45AM EDT)**:  Still down.

There's not much to report, unfortunately, save that it doesn't appear to be down for everyone.  (If you refresh ""Is it down right now?"" several times, it will probably vacillate between telling you ""Yes"" and ""It's just you"".  This doesn't mean it ISN'T down, only that a request went through/managed to ping it/or some such).

There's plenty of speculation and people being paranoid about h@xx0rz, et cetera, whatever...

[Some folks in this UK forum are having a bit of a chat about it](http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/forums/1/tech-helproom/4493135/checking--is-ebay-down-again/?ob=datea&amp;pn=2).  It's not a particularly enlightening conversation, but mildly interesting.

Now, I've just checked on my phone, and it appears to be working fine there.  I'm not particularly tech savvy nor aware of what might cause such issues, so I'll refrain from speculation.

[This is eBay's Twitter](https://twitter.com/ebayinc).  It's supposed to be their official news feed, but who knows whether or not they'll put it to use.  Currently, there's nothing there.

Ebay,What just happened here?,"I bid on a beautiful dress that was listed with several others just alike (but different colors) at 64.97 as the starting bid. I bid 70.34 yesterday, and the auction was supposed to close today. (After ebay was back up and running!) I was the sole bidder, and was watching five minutes before the auction was to close, when I suddenly get a message saying the auction was cancelled due to an error in the listing. 

My instinct is that the seller simply closed the sale because they wanted a better price for it, but that would be unfair/unethical. Is there a way to discover if the seller does this often? They have good ratings, nearly 20,000. However, if this is a regular practice, buyers would gave no means of recourse.

Ebay,Well after 4 years of selling I received my first negative feedback. Reason to believe there was malicious intent. Do I have a shot at getting it removed?,"I'm on mobile so I will try and make this quick but I just received my first negative feedback and I strongly believe it is either a competitors alternate account or a friend. 

Long story short about 2 1/2 weeks ago I received a nasty message from a competitor who went on to rant and rave about how I was breaking all sorts of eBay policies and that they were going to report me (hint: I wasn't). I ignored the message and went about my day. Not more than 2 days later I sold an item to a buyer who conveniently happened to live in the same city as my competitor. I immediately suspected foul play but had no idea if I could do anything at that point. To throw up even more red flags, the product that I sell is only available in my state and the company HQ is located in the competitors city. So there would literally be no reason for someone to buy the item I am selling. I'm not sure why I didn't act on it given those circumstances alone.  I sent the item out the same day and started the waiting game.  

Yesterday, 14 days after the sale I relieved a negative feedback from the buyer with no prior communication stating ""Only one item sent, not 12 as pictured.""  It was a $3 sale and in my listing I state each purchase is for one item. Due to the type of product I sell the stock picture is a variety display of the items that I sell. My competitors also have the same set up. Is there anything I can do to have the negative removed or did I just get screwed by a flawed system?

Ebay,Need advice on an item I sold - Probably going to get a negative rating but need help on how to get it removed when it does happen.,"I sold an item - a type of car DVD player.  I'm positive it worked; I tested it myself before I shipped it out.

Now, the person opened a case and is all pissed off at me, saying I deliberately sent him something that didn't work.  I told him that I'm positive it worked, as I tested it.  I also told him that I would be more than willing to 100% refund, plus his cost of postage, once he sends back.

This is where it gets interesting.  He's refusing to send it back.  He simply wants a refund, or another item.  I know he's probably going to give me a negative rating (regardless of whether he sends the item back).  What type of language does he need to say in the email messages, back and forth, for me to successfully get this idiot's (future) negative feedback removed?  [I.e. how can I successfully bait him into saying something really egregious ?]

And to top it off, he talks in this odd, gangbanger-type style, like he's trying to do the hand-gesture intimidation thing while he communicates.

Here's the exchange so far:

#1 - [him] ""listen I waited 10 days for something that don't even work ,the item have pry marks on the side of the case, like somebody opened it .cause you sent me a defective item im not paying shipping back to you.ps I just received this item about an hr ago. either you send me a functional unit or I want my money back. I feel like I was deceived. thank you. ""

#2 [me] ""I'm sorry you couldn't get the item to work. Personally, though, I have multiple pictures of the item so I know there are no ""pry marks"" as you called them. Furthermore, I personally tested the item with several DVD's I have (I do this for every DVD player I get) and I know the item was fully functional when I shipped it out. However, if the item is not working for you, I'll give you a full refund, but only upon getting the item back from you IN THE SAME CONDITION (unit must be functional, as it was functional when I sent it). I'll reimburse you for postage, too, but only upon receiving the item back. Please let me know how you want to proceed. Thank you, [my name]

#3 [me] [This is the entry where I requested he mail it back first to get the full refund from me]

#4 [him] ""if he sends the carrier to p/u this pcs of junk ,cause im not paying one red cent to send it back. its not my fault this item is not as described it don't work , this tv is unresponsive ,you press a button and nothing happens it was not new .I mean I rarely complain , or rarely have issues, my record proves that.""

#5 [me] [last response, as of now] ""I'll need you to send it back to me before I can issue a refund. I test ALL my electronic equipment before I send it out, and it was working. How exactly is it not working ? And I said I would give you a full refund, plus the cost of shipping that you incur (you'll need to send it to me via Fed Ex Ground, like I sent it to you - that is the best rate shipping). Why would you not send it back under those circumstances ?""

I managed to get speaking to one of their customer care people, who tried to tell me all sorts of crap about how best match works and how that I wasnt meeting the criteria. They tried telling me that my price was too high ( it wasnt, I used Terapeak to identify the ideal price range, and search by price, most of my products in the mid price range), that other sellers were powersellers ( only one of them was). In the end they couldnt give me any real reason why other sellers who don't make the effort show ahead of a seller who plays by ebays rules. Their only suggestion was that I open an ebay business account, but they said that they could not guarantee that it would improve my products search position.


It seems ebay is making sellers ( even casual sellers) jump through hoops so that they can give the appearance of competing with Amazon. All things being equal a seller who makes every effort to meet ebay's requirements should have a better position in their search results than a seller that doesnt.

Ebay,When is the best time to call eBay customer service?,"I need to do some defect removal and would prefer to speak with someone who speaks English and understands where I am coming from.

*The best time is definitely not 11:30amEST.  29 minutes and counting and not a sign of anyone answering the phone at eBay!

*12:30pmEST, still nobody answering. Send food and water.

*12:50- Someone answered! He could not help me out at all, but ""noted""  the defects I was trying to have removed, telling me that they are ""triaging "" all of their defect calls. After 30 minutes with him I am on hold again. 

        So basically if you call regarding a defect, they will determine how urgent they find it to be and will help you out      
        based on their assessment of it's urgency/importance.

*25 minutes into a 12 minute wait time. Geez. 

*A rep picked up, asked me to let him look over the case # for a minute, so we sat in silence for 6 minutes. He now put me back on hold while he reviews each defect in question. (Though the first guy did just that). Back on hold 2 hours 15 minutes into the call. Nothing resolved as of yet.

*15 minutes later- ""I'm still looking into, just wanted to let you know"". Well I flippin hope so!
Back on hold.

*3 hours and 7 minutes into the call: 2 defects removed and I have escalated it to whoever is next in line above the rep.

*27 minutes later ""Haven't forgotten about you, I am transferring you now"". What!?

             Defects unable to be removed:


             1. Item purchased on a Friday night, shipped Monday morning. USPS documented delivery attempted on Thursday and a
              notice left (I do not have signature required, so am not sure why this happened). Item not delivered until 17 days
              later. Rating of 1 received on shipping.

            2. Buyer opens case and claims I sent him the wrong figure but likes it better and wants to keep it. I could not respond
             or offer him anything as he closed the case because he was happy. Inventory shows he received correct item. Defect remains.

           3. neutral feedback left stating ""Awesome Seller, Fast Shipping"" and also a 1star rating on shipping time. Can't be  
            removed because eBay can not assume what the buyer was thinking when he left FB. Shipping time was within my listed shipping handling
            time, but can not be removed because it ""did not meet the buyers expectation"", even though I set the expectation in the listing of how

             send him another one with the 2nd item he just(conveniently) purchased. He leaves a neg and I report him for extortion and 
             get the neg removed. He leaves neutral FB for the 2nd item and it can not be removed because it is the customers opinion
             on how the transaction went.

           5. International buyer messaged through eBay and requested to have item value marked lower. I declined and he left a neg. 
            eBay could not find the message because it was over 90 days old. I gave them the message ID, but the rep said that the 
            feedback was how the buyer thought the transaction went and it was not removable.

            6. Item purchased and shipped next day to Australia. Item Not Received case opened over a month later. Tracking shows the 
             item has been bouncing around Australia for 3 weeks. Item received 6 days after case was opened.



*3:30- I am pretty calm, but had to raise my voice over the rep this was escalated to. He is just reading a script over top of me and now I am back on hold while he looks into a defect.


*He had to consult with the rest of the flock to see if his opinion was right. It was.

*4:05- 4 1/2 hours+ after phone call was placed and still only 2 defects removed. #4 is being""sent to the back office group for review"" which should happen within 72 hours and I will not be notified. #1 ""brought up a good point"" and the rep will ""bubble it up"" at the next meeting and, rest assured, will stay on top of it if anything changes. #6 ~~could~~ should be removed but too much time has passed to do so, but ""Yes, It still affects your overall score.""

Ebay,My idea on how sellers can warn others about bad buyers through feedback (and get away with it),"Everyone knows that sellers can only provide positive feedback to buyers. Ebay also gets pretty upset if you leave positive feedback that's actually negative. For example, ebay would slap you on the wrists pretty hard if you wrote ""This person will not pay you."" as feedback for the buyer.

My solution to this basically boils down to a secret phrase. It's a phrase that sellers would leave as feedback to buyers that are bad/scammy. The phrase could be something like: **!!!~Great-Buyer~!!!**

This looks like normal positive feedback to most people. More importantly, it looks that way to Ebay themselves. To sellers that are in on this phrase, it's a secret warning that this person is a bad buyer. The great thing about this is that Ebay can't punish you for doing it because you've got plausible deniability on your side.",4,2,2014-09-17,EBAY,0.22088216245174408,0.7430599927902222,0.036057788878679276

Ebay,Looks like USPS sent package to the wrong house. Can I win a INR case on ebay?,"Last month I sold a small item that I shipped through First Class mail with tracking. I pretty sure I printed it out with no changes to the address or name because I like to keep sellers protection, and shipped it within 1 business day. A little over a month later the customer opens a case (today) and is wondering where is his package and requested tracking. I check tracking and it is delivered in his state and zip code but says STERLING, VA 20166 instead of DULLES, VA 20166. Googling those two shows they share the same zip code and are the same place?

It's possible it was shipped to the wrong house, or it actually went to the right house and he missed the package somewhere?

Item is only 6 dollars.

How should I go about this so I don't get dinged? I think I'll be issuing a refund or just say it was delivered, but wanted to hear what you guys think the final outcome will be (will I win or not, get dinged or not?) before I respond. thanks

Ebay,Going to start using the manual block list more and also going to utilize buyer black list.,"It may not be much, but I'm going to do everything I can to protect my assets.  I've been under utilizing my blocklist since I started selling and I'm going to start throwing problem buyers on it.  Scammers blocked, idiots blocked, issues that are my fault but buyer is highly unreasonable are blocked.  Chances are, any buyer that opens a case against me will be blocked.  Particularly bad buyers will be submitted to the [blacklist.](http://www.ebayblacklist.co/)  
  
That brings me to my next item, the blacklist.  It has around 2000 usernames on the list and that's probably a drop in the bucket compared to the actual number of bad buyers on the site but every little bit helps.  I know what you're thinking, how can you verify the names on the list are actually bad?  You can't really; I've perused the list and checked some of the accounts.  Some are new accounts, accounts with little feedback and the like; but a few are actually very likely bad buyers with the usually idiot feedback (""Item needs to be returned"" without contacting seller ect).  That alone is worth it for me.

Ebay,Just had 5 defects removed,"Thought you guys might like to know currently what is being removed and for what reason.  This is my experience. It seems to change every time I call. 

1.  The customer gave me the wrong house #.  Packaged returned as no such address. INR Case opened. Case closed in my favor.  Customer mentioned the street # in messages so the ebay rep could tell it wasn't matching the ebay address. 

2. Customer opened INAD case 53 days after purchase.   Ebay closed in my favor because it is out of the 45 day buyer protection period.

3. Customer opened INR case while item was in transit. I tried to have ebay close the case in my favor once delivered, but the customer closed it the minute it was delivered.  The first time I called they said there was nothing they could do. Second time I called they said they would remove the defect. 

4. Customer didn't want the item. They ordered the wrong item, but in their mind I shipped them the wrong item. (complex parts)  They contacted me directly through phone.  I issued a paypal refund and did not open a case because I thought maybe they wouldn't agree to a ""customer ordered item by mistake"" cancelation.  So according to the ebay rep any paypal refund without opening a case counts as a ran out of stock defect.  This was on my report, but I have done more than one of these and they were not on my report.  So maybe the best thing to do to avoid one of these is to just send a payment instead of a refund.  The rep said if I canceled it for ""other reason""  and the buyer accepted it would not count as a defect.  We'll see. 

5. Customer opened INAD case.  I pointed out that they had ordered the wrong model. Customer agreed. I still processed a refund.  Ebay removed this defect, even though I was under the impression that even if the customer made the error they could still request a refund and any refund is a defect.  Maybe I am wrong or maybe the rep screwed up. 

This is pretty good considering a little over a month ago they were not removing defects for any reason. 

Sucks that it wasted an hour of my time.  

I asked about the ""requests"" vs ""cases"" and she didn't really give me a clear answer. She kind of said they count as a defect, but kind of said they don't unless they escalade to a case, so I am unclear about this.",10,3,2014-09-18,EBAY,0.14753727614879608,0.8222034573554993,0.03025929071009159

Ebay,Weird situation I've run in to. Is it a scam?,"The other day I sold a graphing calculator to an eBay user who we'll refer to as User 1. I printed a shipping label through eBay and sent it to him. Today, I received a message from a different user, who we'll call User 2. He claims to have received the calculator despite never ordering it. I have never dealt with User 2 on eBay.

At this point I was very confused, so I checked User 1's seller protection address on the PayPal transaction. The name (and I'm assuming the whole address) on the seller protected address is User 2's, which is a different name than User 1 has on the actual PayPal account.

Ebay,Do I issue the refund?,"So I've only recently started selling things on Ebay and so far I've had 5 star reviews. I recently sold a pair of my wife's boots and now that they have arrived the buyer wants a refund. They said in their case: 

&gt; ""these boots are worn a lot,the seller says they have been worn a couple of times and that is not true. they look bad and I want my money back""

I put in original description that they had only been worn once, which they had been. I'm afraid that they just didn't get what they expected they would get. 

So do I issue the refund? I paid $15 for the shipping, just to make sure that they didn't get folded/creased in transit. I'm not against issuing the refund, I just want to make sure it's the best decision before I go through with it.

Ebay,"Just started selling, First Buyer wants a refund 30 days later.","My first sell was a cellphone motherboard(Used but Working), Listed Carrier, all specs, etc. 

I shipped, money went through, thought everything was fine until yesterday. I logged in to paypal to add funds and my account was sitting in the negatives. I had transferred the money to my bank to pay for my tuition at school, leaving ~$3 in there.

So I checked ebay and the buyer opened a Item not as described case stating that I shipped it 'Ridiculously' which had damaged the item. I disassembled the motherboard and shipped it in an anti static case, in a bubble wrapped envelope. The same way I shipped phone motherboards before. Never having issues. 

I noted no refunds/returns in my listing. I will refund upon return if that's what I really *have* to do but I am hesitant because the  buyer waited 30 days, no contacting me via messages. Only leaving a false bad review. 

I also know the buyer is a seller and owns a shop where he resells. So my thinking was he couldn't resell it. 

I have pictures leading up to the sell of it turning on and functioning. I tested the motherboard out before shipping.

Ebay,Bought a phone on Ebay and just ran into problems with the seller.,"So I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and was very excited. However, it had an issue with overheating. We're talking uncomfortable temperatures when holding it and all my friends who have the same have never experienced that. With that came an unusually short battery life. 

I asked the sellers and they said to send the item back, which I did. A few days later, I received the item back again, thus wasting my £8 on delivery. 

Here's the interesting part, they claim that the phone I sent back wasn't the same one. They say the ""serial number"" was different than to the one on the invoice. Furthermore, they claim there's a dent which didn't exist before. I literally kept the phone in the case at all times and it hasn't left the house. I've been accused of being a scammer by the seller and a criminal. He's used vile language. 

I want my money back and to return him the phone, I also want the money he wasted in delivery, if possible. How do I go about claiming my money or using the Ebay or PayPal Buyer Protection? I feel nervous for some odd reason and helpless because I have no means of proving that he's a liar and being manipulative. I haven't done any wrong and I would appreciate any help.

Ebay,Is this an example of feedback extortion?,"I'm a U.S. seller, sold an item to a U.S. buyer. She received the item and immediately wrote to me claiming INAD and demanding a partial refund while she keeps the item. 

(Not only am I certain she is lying about it being INAD -- but doing a little digging I found another seller she had bought a similar item from recently. That seller told me this same buyer tried the exact same thing with her.)

Anyway, I responded to the buyer that I do not offer partial refunds, but would be happy to give a full refund upon receipt of the item in its original condition. This set off a flurry of hostile messages (through the eBay message system) from the buyer, promising to leave me great feedback if I will simply offer a partial refund because even though she claims to not be satisfied with the item, she does not want to bother with returning it.

So my question is, is promising to leave good feedback if you cave in to the buyer's demand the same thing as feedback extortion? Technically she is not threatening to leave negative feedback, but IMO the veiled threat is obvious.",9,17,2014-09-21,EBAY,0.07476481050252914,0.8896348476409912,0.035600386559963226

Ebay decides in my favor on the case - and I block the username and move on

NOW a month later message received from different username claiming to be her husband: 

MSG 1: ""My wife bought this coin changer from you for my birthday. I was excited to get it but when I put coins in it and tried it, it didn't work. We tried many times and it looks great but it's not working. Please take this back or send one that works. My wife is upset and I am disappointed but told her you would make things right. Please help!! Thank you in advance."" 

MY RESPONSE: ""Ok which coin changer? I need the item number or title of the listing - I sell many items on ebay. Thanks""

MSG 2: RESPONDS WITH ITEM TITLE AND NUMBER

MY RESPONSE: ""So first of all your wife (the purchaser) told me she never received it and demanded a refund and opened a case against me AND left me negative feedback, when the item was delivered in fact proven by tracking and now your confirming this - and the case was decided in my favor - and now your saying its broken because your first scam to try and get your money back was unsuccessful so your trying a second time? This item was also tested out and even used by me at flea markets. I'm sorry there is nothing I can do."" 
-(IMMEDIATELY BLOCKED THIS GUYS USERNAME AFTER THIS MESSAGE)

MSG 3: ""As I stated I got this as a gift from my wife and it never worked. I am not asking for my money back I am asking for an exchange for one that works. If your wife committed a crime should you be found guilty? I told her it was not your fault. Look this is not about your problem you might have with another customer it's very black and white. You sold us a product that does not work. Trust me when I say this. I make a much better friend then an enemy.
All I am guilty of is opening up my birthday present to find it doesn't work. I am not and I repeat I am not asking for her money back. I just want one that works. It may have worked for you and for that I am eternally grateful that your experience with it was so amazing but it never worked for me.
Again let me repeat myself. I am just asking for one that works if you wanna play judge and jury for something my wife did let me be 100% clear. I have not and never will accept responsibility for someone else's actions. How dare you accuse me of things I have not done. So you could take care of this or you can start world war three as I stated I make a much better friend then an enemy. I will defend myself when I am falsely accused and called a liar. Now please man up and handle this or you and I are going to get to know one another very very well.""

So now what? they live halfway across the country so I don't think im in any physical danger - but people are crazy - they have my address from the return address postage label on the package that she claims she never received. I'm more scared of them creating accts or getting other users to harm my ebay account in which i cant afford any malicious activity on my account. 

UPDATE: 

heres the message I wake up to this morning after already reporting him: 

""Your answer didn't make sense. But then your lack of caring and understanding in this matter lack sense as well . I will not accept your utter hate for my wife as your reason for refusing to do what is right. Grow a backbone and own up to this. You knew this coin changer didn't work and yet you sold it to her. EBay may have rules but common sense needs to take the front seat sometimes. To hide behind there vague return policy thus protecting your defective product is something I refuse to accept. I have NOTHING to lose in proceeding with this manor in whatever steps I must take legally to seek justice. It is you my friend who has far more to lose than I. Justice will prevail.
As I stated to you in the past I make a much better friend then an enemy. All you had to do was to accept your responsibility for sending what you knew and know is a defective item, then make it right . But you have chosen to hide behind their vague return policy. So be it. As I said you and I are going to get to know one another very well. I have not heard you apologize for calling me a liar and with no remorse on your part. I am left with the knowing that you are handling this ( was a small problem ) the way you are because of your hatred for my wife. Again, this has nothing to do with her and everything to do with your defective and non working item you sold to her as a gift to me and your inability to accept responsibility once caught and confronted . When your intimidation toward my wife and I failed you went to plan B.
I can only guess you must be in pretty bad financial straits in order to take our money in a deceitful way like this but in the long run your hatred will cost you far more in time, reputation and money.
As I said I will not rest until all legal means have been exhausted. This is no longer about a coin changer it's about people feeling safe when ordering on Ebay by scrupulous sellers like yourself. FOX news likes this story. Think of it as free advertising"" 

UPDATE 2: NEW MSG FROM USER: 

heres the latest update / next message received: ""Okay sweetie! You have had your fun ripping us off. But now it's my turn to have fun. I didn't want it to come to this but you begged for it. First I am going to send out a major blast on Facebook not to buy anything from you. We have a magazine with over 75,000 readers. We'll start there because it's only going to take a minute to do. As their trusted editor, I will inform them even if you have the only 2 items of it's kind in the world and it's only $1.00. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. It will come broken and they will call you a liar and not give you your money back or exchange the item. But baby love that's not where the fun starts. Oh no no no. The next step is in the works. Now, honey bun; it's my turn to screw you without buying you a drink first. You have run out of options. But mine are only starting to come alive. I know what we are about to go through won't make you happy at all but, you can at least appreciate my inventiveness and maybe the next time you will treat the customer better. But if all works out, you will not get another chance to rape another customer. HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT MY WIFE LIKE THAT! YOU SPINLESS LITTLE CREEP!!! Gosh.

Ebay,"No-win situation on ""item not as described"" case.","Hello all,

I am posting here as an attempt to get some advice. I have been backed into a no-win situation by a seller in Singapore and eBay themselves.

I ordered my item on 9/4. after 3-4 days my item had not shipped, I messaged the seller asking when I could expect them to ship my item. They apologized as they had a recent break for a national holiday and said my package would be right off as soon as ""we test the item"", which was listed as brand new, unopened. By the 8th day after I bought the item it was at last shipped and on its way.

An item gets to me in good time no problem, but once the box is opened the real problem starts. I ordered the model ""U65GT"" and got instead a much older, less RAM, less memory, less EVERYTHING model known as the ""U59GT"". The seal is broken, the wall adapter isn't even in the box with the tablet. Cue the rage as I have spent $220 for an unopened item and got an opened item that is sold for around $150 on eBay. These people said themselves they have laid eyes on my item, and still no one noticed that I was being sent an inferior version of what I bought.

I open a case with the seller and explain everything. I refuse to pay for return shipping for the wrong item, and I want the item I paid for. Seller responds within 20 minutes 3 times in 15 minutes asking me to ""please send pictures"" and ""we are sorry"" while I snap photos of the evidence. They even requested a video to be uploaded to Youtube (??). They get my pictures, the seller says ""I will talk to my boss"" and ""we will get you a replacement"".

24 hours later I hear back, ""we need you to send the wrong item first"". I explain that again I will not pay shipping as I was never supposed to have this item, and tell them I want a return shipping label and the correct tablet sent to me first. I express concern of this not happening within the 30 days ebay gives you to escalate the case, and inform them this all needs to be done before then. 24 hours later (note the significant slow down in responses compared to when I first opened the case) they say ""we can't send you replacement until we get wrong tablet back"" and they reveal to me that they have a WAREHOUSE IN THE USA (wut?) and that a replacement would not take long to get to me if sent from there. They also readily tell me that I can just get a refund with ebay, almost as to say they really don't care either way.

Unhappy with their solution I give ebay a call. First time I tell the whole story to the rep after being on hold for 15 min (estimated wait time, 2 min!) she tells me if they have a warehouse in the US ebay can cover the shipping. She transfers me to the escalation team where I wait 10 more min, then suddenly get a busy tone and am disconnected and have to start all over. Second call (estimated wait time, 2 min!) I wait for 18 min and just tell the rep that I was being transferred to the escalation team, she transfers me. I get someone in escalations, finally! I wait for her to read over the case and then informs me ""we cannot cover shipping for international transactions."" WHAT?! I tell her that was not what I was told in my first call, and point out again the seller saying they have a warehouse located in the US and ask if we can send it there. She said ebay can cover the shipping if we can get the address from the seller and onto the sellers account. But ultimately, in order to get a refund the wrong item has to be back in the hands of the seller before it can be done. She told me she would message the seller requesting the address for the USA warehouse and for them to put that address on their account so a shipping label can be made.

So now its nearing the last week of September, I made my call to ebay on Friday so I expect to not hear anything from anyone until the week begins. I expect also that the seller is going to say ""oops we lied about that warehouse"" or make some other excuse to not reveal the location, stating ""it has to be sent to us in Singapore"" which will take some two weeks alone for it to get there. Expecting the worst case I just looked up how much it is to ship this thing back to Singapore. From USPS and DHL its going to be $85 to $99... Almost. $100.

I am beside myself over all of this. Even if I keep the item and sell it I am still taking a loss. Every scenario that these people have put me in has me out almost $100 and it is not okay.

Is there anything left that I can do? Do I just accept that I've been scammed and ebay is just gonna throw their hands up and not help? Is a chargeback (bank card, used as credit card on my PP) even an option after this much time, and if I do that will paypal fee/ban me?

I appreciate any attempts to advise.

TL;DR, bought item, took forever to ship, got sent completely different item marketed at $70 less in value, now pinned in a corner by ebay and seller that puts me out almost $100 no matter what.

**UPDATE** 
Called ebay back after seeing no correspondence between ebay and the seller and no update to my case. Informed the seller of my intent to return the item for a refund, the seller revealed that of course their USA warehouse cannot receive items (also, the ""USA warehouse"" was out of stock and back in stock with my tablet within 2 days and 5 more messages from the seller). The rep I spoke with tonight found this case to have been drawn out for too long and that the seller should have sent me that label a while back, and advised me to escalate it to get a return shipping label. They did not try and say that my transaction was not covered by the TOS update making it the seller's responsibility for return shipping. I am satisfied as I feel like this mess is finally coming to a close 10 days later.

Ebay,Negative feedback because the buyer wanted the item shipped to a different address,"Sold a T shirt and the buyer messaged me to send it to another address because the one listed was an old address. I responded the same day asking her to correct the address on ebay and paypal with instructions on how to do it. I explained that I was not protected if I send it to anywhere other then the address on the account.

A day later no response. Sent another message. Next day still no response. Called ebay. they told me to cancel the transaction and refund the money. This had to be a mutual agreement (I'm not real familiar with the different types) so the buyer could agree or disagree. 

Six days later the seller gets back to me and said she just figured out how to check her messages because she is new to ebay, although the account was created in 2007, but she only had a feedback of 5 . She told me she changed it but when I went to the print screen for the label the ""old"" address shows up!

I message her back showing her the address was still the old one. I ask her to call ebay so they could help her and also told her that I had refunded her money but would still like to sell to her if she would correct and repay. Here's wher I made a mistake. I relisted thinking I had to do that so she could repurchase and I told her that in the message. 

The next day I realized that I probably shouldn't have done that and I unlisted it, or so I thought! I sent her a message and told her what happened and again ask her to pay. A little while later I see the shirt has sold, but not to her. S#!*. Called ebay and explained what happened, they suggested it was best to send to the buyer that paid and let the chips fall where they may.

I messaged the original buyer and explained what happened and apologized. She ask if I had refunded her money??? Yes, a week ago!!!

I thought she understood until a few days later when I got the negative feedback. ""seller reposted item for sell, seller refunded my money."" Absolutely correct but, do I have an argument to have this removed?

TL/DR: Sold item. Please send to another address. Can't do please fix. Buyer doesn't have a clue how to use ebay or check email. Accidentally resold. F@%! me! $5.00 profit + 1 negative feedback, woo hoo!!!

Ebay,Ebay just F%$# me over with a sale i did a month ago by siding with an abusive buyer and a liar.,"So i posted my old Iphone 5 to sell for how ever much it sold for i didn't really care how much i get for it. i clearly stated that it is worn and it can be used for spare parts it comes with no charger and that the reception is weak to non-functional. and posted all the appropriate pictures that shows all the scratches and the bumps . it ended up selling for 180 British sterling . fast forward a month later, and i get these abusive emails through eBay accusing me of being a liar , and that the phone does not work (it worked fine the only issue with the device was the reception which i stated , when it came to using it as an iPod or just to browse the internet or use apps , the phone was absolutely fine) so the buyer opened a case on it  as well as sending me 2 abusive emails , i called eBay i told them the situation and what happened and about the abusive emails , and they asked me to open a case against him etc. they message me today to tell me that they will side with the buyer, when i researched the buyers history , there was another issue with another seller selling an iphone 5 as the buyer had done the same issues with him , being abusive as well on his review .

am i being unreasonable to being upset with ebay here ? this is just ridiculous , (also please not the buyer posted pictures of the same angles of the phone that i had posted only the backside looked alot more scratched than the picture i took , and i did no editing on my pictures (why would i that would be stupid) )",3,4,2014-09-22,EBAY,0.11208581924438477,0.8507535457611084,0.037160590291023254

I understand things happen, but I waited on this guy for additional time and then he comes back and cancels the order. I could have ordered it and had it in hand. Maybe I'm just disappointed in how it was handled, but listing an item that you don't have in stock doesn't seem like a responsible seller.

Ebay,Buyers on ebay disgust me.,"I sold a Nintendo 3ds on ebay.  A full 2 weeks after receiving the item, the buyer claims it has a defect.  The screen is yellowing.  His proof was a picture of the screen in camera mode which indeed looked yellow.  

So I offer to have him send the item back for a full refund.  Got the item today and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  I tested all functions for over an hour.  

What he did was he took a picture, yellowed it photoshop, uploaded it to the SD card and displayed it on the screen to make the screen seem yellow.  I know because he failed to delete the picture when he sent it back and it's still saved on the system.

Now basically I'm out my shipping cost and he's wasted 3 weeks of my time.  Oh and he stole the protective carrying case that I sent with the system.",16,17,2014-09-26,EBAY,0.08014177531003952,0.8780743479728699,0.04178386926651001
Ebay,Yet another way eBay's setup can rig your Seller Performance rating,"I just got off the phone with eBay in an attempt to remove some undeserved defects. I got one out of four removed. Woohoo!

One **was** able to be removed because it was an Item Not Received case and we had proof of delivery. Awesome!

One was **not** able to be removed because it was an Item Not Received case but because we issued a full refund to the buyer for the $15 item when they threw a fit, it automatically closed the case. The item was delivered just a day later. eBay says because we closed the case the defect cannot be removed. Meh, OK I guess.

One was **not** able to be removed because it was a situation in which we did not ship to the buyer's country. Though our listing stated this and our auction settings showed we did not ship outside of the US, he was still able to purchase. eBay has told me in the past this sometimes happens and buyers ""slip by"". I guess our was globally set up for the Global Shipping Program at the time so this was technically our mistake (despite the buyer asking us to cancel and having no issue with the situation). All right, we'll accept that.

One was **not** able to be removed because we issued a full refund to someone who returned an item they didn't want. They did not send us a message in the message system and they did not open a case. They no longer wanted the item, returned it to us with a note inside the package stating this, and we issued a refund when we received it. But because we issued the refund prior to sending a Cancel Purchase request, it counts as a defect.

**Wait, WHAT?!**

When you are attempting to Cancel a Purchase as a Seller, the page INSTRUCTS you to issue a refund to the buyer first. You are not supposed to send that Cancel Purchase Request until you've issued a full refund to the buyer according to that page. The representative told me that you will receive a defect unless that Cancel Purchase Request is sent first.

In case you have never had a buyer purchase (pay for) an item and needed to go through the Cancel Sale process, this is the final screen you see before you open the case against the buyer:  http://imgur.com/ZSKvOV0.

eBay CLEARLY tells you ""Before you cancel a transaction... Send a refund"" and even say they advise buyers to not accept a cancellation until they receive the refund. And sure enough, looking at our report, every single sale we cancelled because the buyer REQUESTED IT after they paid for it (don't want it anymore, found it cheaper, my son's dog bid on this item I DO NOT WANT IT) we had a defect. Why is this not fixed IMMEDIATELY?! Seems like a great way to help get those Top Rated Seller's perks taken away. 

Has anyone else fallen into this trap? If you sell over 100 items weekly and have a lot of transactions, be sure to download your defect report and take a look at any of your cancelled sale defects. Make SURE they all check out. As a side note, keep up with your Item Not Received defects as well. This is right up there with Buyers wanting to simply send a message to a Seller and clicking ""Contact Seller"" which presents them with four options, all of which open a case against the Seller (and giving them a defect automatically). THEN an option at the bottom that says ""Other"" which allows you to directly message the Seller.

When I pointed out this huge flaw to the representative I of course got the ""Yes we are aware of the issue and are working on a way to get that sorted out."" Oh, ok. Considering how often buyers cancel even after they pay, have buyer's remorse, or return / cancel at NO fault of a seller there should *probably* be a way to follow eBay's rules and not receive a defect.",14,12,2014-09-26,EBAY,0.0691753402352333,0.8976439237594604,0.03318073973059654

Ebay,Retract winning bid? Seems unfair,"Basically I really wanted this Item, however the seller did not list the shipping fees so I assumed it would be just the default overseas shipping price. To make sure I messed him four times over the time span of a week before the bid is over. 

I really wanted this item so to my mistake I placed the highest bid. He still hasn't replied to my message and ONLY after I've won the bid he messages me the shipping price at a ridiculous amount of $140 (From US to Aus) which is worth more than the item itself...

From the fishiness of this I doubt the seller would agree to mutually retract the bid, so I was wondering what options I would be left with as I really am against paying for this.",6,5,2014-09-26,EBAY,0.1278248131275177,0.8077337145805359,0.06444147229194641
Ebay,"I thought buyer was asking for a refund, so I obliged and he then left a negative.","Item scheduled to ship this month (a preorder that was accurately described). Buyer gets weekly emails from me keeping him up to date,  though he is continually messaging me for more status updates.  High maintenance buyer, not a problem. 

Item arrives in stock in large b&amp;m store yesterday as well as my distributor and my shipment is marked as being processed,  so a couple days until it ships to me. 

Buyer messages saying  ""these are on shelves,  why don't I have mine? "".

I have been through this before and can sense he is worried or upset so I explain that they should be here soon and why some stores may have them before I do and  I will continue to keep him updated, it won't be long now...

He messages right back saying ""Alright I am about to have to get a refund.""

It is not uncommon for someone to cancel a preorder once an item hits a b&amp;m store, as they see their chance to get it in their hand asap, and I am very understanding and quick to hand out a refund of they ask,  so I send a refund and a cancelation request and he fires back cursing at me saying I'm scamming him. I let him know I read his message as wanting a refund,  apologize if I misunderstood him and let him know  he can purchase it again if he would like and  then he negs me with ""these people do horrible business"".

Say what you want about preorders, eBay allows them and has rules specifically for them. I have done this enough to know that if a buyer is annoyed and asks for a refund, my window to get that to him before a case is opened is very small.

Ebay,I'm almost ready to dive into selling. Are there certain items I should hold until I've learned the ropes?,,3,3,2014-09-29,EBAY,0.03546103462576866,0.8836639523506165,0.08087503165006638
Ebay,Is there anything I can do?,"I recently sold an item on ebay which was near brand new, but had one minor imperfection on the outer frame of a Galaxy S4 LCD. I sold it as a used item grade A. Two weeks after the item sold, the buyer contacted me saying it wasn't in as good of condition as he thought it was and that it wouldn't work for him. Even though the post said no returns, I thought I'd be nice and I told him to send it back and I'd issue a full refund. When I received the item back, the outer glass was cracked in several spots and the bottom LCD was destroyed. I told him because he attempted to install the item and damaged it, I couldn't issue a refund. He promptly opened a case with ebay and within 24 hours they issued him a full refund without contacting me at all... 

I got completely shafted for doing nothing wrong by using ebay's services as they were intended to be used. I tried calling ebay to talk to someone about it, but after sitting on hold for an hour I gave up and hung up the phone. What does a seller do in this situation, and how do I prevent this from happening in the future?",5,2,2014-09-29,EBAY,0.12149548530578613,0.8499404788017273,0.028564024716615677
Ebay,Seller stealing from multiple buyers.,"A little over a week ago I bought an Xbox One from a seller on eBay who had 100% positive feedback and seemed like a loyal trustable seller based off of their feedback I had read from other customers. After I made the payment to that seller, I recieved immediate feedback from them stating I was a great buyer. I waited two days for a shipping confirmation and never recieved one, so I sent the seller two messages on eBay asking when I should expect to recieve my item. I checked PayPal to confirm that the payment had been fully processed just to make sure they had already recieved their money, which they did. 
	
I waited a full day for a response, and never got one, so I sent an email to the email adress the seller provided on their paypal/eBay account asking what was going on , waited another day for a response, and still never heard anything back. I decided to open a dispute and escalate it to a claim against the seller on PayPal the same day I emailed them due to their lack of response just to play it safe in case the purchase was a scam. A few days after that I recieved a notification on eBay stating that the item I bought had shipped, but the shipping number was unable to be tracked. I waited an additional two days to see if I could track the package, and still have no information on if the package has actually shipped or if the seller is lying. 
	
Today I found out that the seller has in fact been accepting buyers payments and not shipping their items, which is obviously stealing. I went to take a look at their feedback page and there are now eight negative feedback ratings on their account. The day I bought it there were none. So within a week they've been lying and stealing from multiple eBay buyers based on their feedback they gave the seller. Several of the buyers stated that they payed the buyer and never received the item they purchased which is what I am currently experiencing. 
	
I left the seller a strongy negative feedback rating which closes the case on the purchase aparently. Am I still going to be able to get my money back being that I opened a claim on PayPal (which is a copletey seperate company than ebay) many days in advance? I also opened a case on eBay the same day I made the claim on PayPal. Even though I closed the case on eBay does that mean it is a done deal? I refuse to believe that eBay would let this seller walk away with all of this money they have stolen from their buyers. The fact that I just lost $400 makes me sick to my stomach. I have plenty of evidence that proves they took my money.
	 
Any help or advice is greatly apreciated. It would really be comforting to know that eBay and PayPal aren't going to walk away from this without helping me get my stolen money back.

Ebay,Aspect Ratio of item image in Ebay Mobile,"So when I search something in eBay mobile all the item images have a landscape aspect ratio, versus the desktop site which has a 1x1 aspect ratio for the images. 

Does anyone know the exact aspect ratio for these images?

Ebay,"USPS scanned package ""Delivered"" rather than ""Accepted""! Has this ever happened to anyone?","I shipped an order yesterday via USPS. As a routine part of doing business I check my tracking on a daily basis.   When one shipment was scanned, it appears that USPS marked it ""Delivered"" rather than ""Accepted"". I have never encountered this before. I have emailed USPS and am waiting for a reply. I feel I need to contact the customer and explain the situation but should I wait until I hear back from USPS  first? What would you recommend?

Update - After seeing so many comments on packages not updating, I called USPS. The package apparently was delivered today - but the tracking never updated along the way. The USPS customer service rep was super helpful and opened a case for me to provide a way to have Confirmation in the event the buyer were to say they didn't receive it.",13,8,2014-09-30,EBAY,0.04222330078482628,0.9189310073852539,0.038845647126436234

Ebay,Am I being scammed?,"I'm new to selling, and my auction just completed last night. The buyer has messaged me saying that his credit card had been charged, and that funds would be available to me after my item was delivered. Ebay has marked it as still awaiting payment. I arranged for shipping and messaged the seller that I would ship once I received confirmation that he paid, and he insists again that funds will be available after delivery. This smells a little funny to me. What are my options?",8,7,2014-09-30,EBAY,0.043812237679958344,0.9074915051460266,0.048696305602788925
Ebay,Moneypak question,"So I briefly looked in to these.  Seems just like a prepaid card that you can add money on to.  My question is that a buyer for one of my auctions only feedback is selling 3 of these cards, one was loaded with $200 and sold for $350 another for $330.  So two questions a.) why are they worth more than what is on them and b.) if they arent, should I be on a look out for a scam.

   (0)  Accept the return
    You'll pay for return shipping and can send our return label or send your own. Wait to get the item back before you refund the buyer.
   (0) Refund the buyer
    The buyer will keep the item, and you can fully refund the buyer to close this request.
   (0) Offer a partial refund

Ebay,Best way to appeal USPS online claim?,"I've done USPS domestic claims before, but never online. USPS denied my claim for an insured/sig confirmed package, saying that they would not accept the proof of value I submitted. I sent in a screenshot of the eBay order transaction.

I just want to be absolutely sure to do the correct thing because if they reject it I cannot appeal again.
