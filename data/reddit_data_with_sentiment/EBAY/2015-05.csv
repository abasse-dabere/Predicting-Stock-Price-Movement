Hi, i left an open dispute because the tracking both on ebay and usps is saying that the package was delivered to me but i did not received any package! it's the first time for me that a package its marked as delivered and i did not received it.

I tell him a in a message that i can't accept this return based on the reasoning for the return and that nothing is wrong with it. Didn't hear anything back since then. A few days later i ask on here what i should do ect. A user points out that's a clear break of policy and rules of the INAD, and links me ebay rules on their site and suggests i reply to case with it. After I do that I've gotten no word from eBay or the buyer since the 17th of April. Now that all of that is out of the way my question is, if ebay steps in i would almost indefinitely lose the case since ebay sides with the buyer correct? And I've heard if the buyer and seller don't respond for 10 days the case is thrown out..? Not sure what to do and need some help lol

Posted a few hours ago asking how long it takes for ebay to throw out a case, since he hadn't responded to me since the case was opened  was told a few weeks and to wait it out. About 30 minutes ago i receive a message from the guy saying this

 ""No the package was sent to Mollie dindorf the name and address you had sent to me. Whoever she is has the iPod and I want my $90 we are also filing a claim with eBay and paypal""  

I have no idea who this person is or what he's talking about. But i find it suspicious that it took him a 3 weeks to say anything back, then claims he never had it at all which is contradictory to his original reason for wanting to return it since he'd have to have it in his hands to know whether or not it would work a certain way. And the tracking + shipping label were created directly from eBay and matched with his paypal address so I'm not sure where this Mollie person is coming from. Any advice? I've never been in a situation like this.",7,3,2015-05-04,EBAY,0.08706993609666824,0.883291482925415,0.029638590291142464
Ebay,Question regarding postage stamps and printing labels online,"I have a bunch of $5.60 priority postage stamps. I ship a lot of flat rate envelopes. I am wondering if I can print the label online but not pay and just affix the stamp? I know the envelope cost $5.05 online, but the discount I get on the stamps is more than the extra $.55 I'd be paying so I don't care.

Otherwise, would I be correct to assume I can bring the package in to a post office location and pay them $0.15 and one $5.60 stamp to ship a flat rate envelope ($5.75 in store)?

Are there any other solutions I'm not thinking of?

Ebay,Where are all those views coming from?,"Yesterday I posted two items on ebay using the shareware tool [GarageSale](http://www.iwascoding.com/GarageSale/).

Ebay,"Buyer refuses to pick up item from post office, files ""Item not received"" case against me.","Just wondering how you deals with problems like that? 

Guy from UK bought an item from me in mid March, and later discovered that he had to pay import taxes. Trying to be nice, and avoiding a huge hassle, I agreed that I'd partially refund him to cover some part of the import. We were fine after that, and the last time I heard from him he had arranged with the post office to pick up the item...this was six weeks ago. 


Last night, the day before claims window closes, he opens a INR case against me. Apparently he never bothered to collect it from the post office, as it's still being held there (Thank god for that, at least it's not lost!). 
He simply asked me if I had gotten it in return, or if I had insured it , which I have at full value (500$). 
I uploaded the tracking number, have all the papers, all messages and emails between us.  

I'll potentially have to shell out 50$ in return shipping. And on top of that, I sent him 60$ as partial refund for the import taxes and VAT, and I originally paid 50$ in shipping. In total I'll be 160$ in the red on this deal if he wins...it's infuriating.  

What would you do? This is the reason I hate dealing with people online, too many jerks treating used sales as a 45-day (now 180) free returns store.",8,14,2015-05-05,EBAY,0.08894979953765869,0.8829953670501709,0.028054771944880486
Ebay,ELI5 New eBay listing / insertion fees,"Apologies in advance if this is wordy, I don't know how to quite ask this. 

I do not have an eBay store. I would only list items if there was a free listing offer or use the 100 free I was given a month. 
I never paid to list an item. 

Now. I am only given 20 free listings a month. If I want to list anything more I will have to pay the insertion fee only if the item does not sell? If it sells, I get that back. 
Before, I was able to have more flexibility with my listings, because 100. But now if I list anything past the 20 free, I have to be careful and be certain that the item will sell just so I don't have to pay that fee? Its more of a risk for me. I have to be more conservative with the 20 free I am given a month because its not as huge of a loss if those items don't sell.

Ebay,"ebay allowed some kid to ruin a brand new motorcycle helmet and return it to me, no investigation at all","I made the stupid mistake of selling something expensive on ebay, a brand new Arai motorcycle helmet originally worth $530, but since it was last year's model and had sat for a while, I sold it for $350.

Some kid bought it, was so eager to get it he offered to drive 3 hours to my house to get it rather than wait, but that didn't work out so I overnighted it to him.  Two weeks later I get a message saying he found some damage, and that it ""doesn't fit right"", accusing me of selling something ""severely used"".  
I rejected the return and ebay allowed him to return it anyway, and automatically refunded him out of my account.

Not only did it have a couple light scratches on it, and the pads were stretched out as if from heavy use, but the kid discarded secure packaging material (further proof he had been using it a while) and just dropped it in a box of loose packing peanuts.  A $500 helmet dropped in packing peanuts.  I even have a porch camera shot of the UPS guy throwing the box over my gate (I always have packages sent to my office but ebay just told him to send it to my billing address).

When I appealed the case ebay's response was ""You should factor these kind of losses into your business model"", and that was that.
Besides telling everyone I know about this in hopes of protecting my friends from this kind of behavior, is there anything I can do as far as communicating with ebay?  

UPDATE: my griping and complaining forinally got someone from higher up to call me directly.  They gave me half credit for the loss of value on my helmet.  It seems pretty fair to me since I do have the helmet and someone would likely pay half for what's basically still new helmet.  I can buy new pads for it and recover the cost in the sale price.  So ebay came through in the end I suppose.  I just wish they put a little more effort into researching this in the first place instead of handing me a form response without checking my side of the story.",4,5,2015-05-05,EBAY,0.04089365154504776,0.9197056889533997,0.039400652050971985
Ebay,"Sold a car to overseas buyer, Car was never picked up and ended up destroyed in a fire. Now after 18 months buyer wants money back. What do I do?","Here is the background: Sold a car to an overseas buyer in September of 2013. I agreed to store car for 30 days while he coordinated shipping. He paid the winning bid via paypal. I was contacted by a shipping company a few weeks later. After 60 days of no contact I tracked down the shipper and he too had lost contact with the buyer. Tried to reach buyer by email, phone, and Fedex, nothing. Late January 2014 house burns with car in garage, Fire presumed to have started with battery charger that was maintaining the battery on the car I had sold. After the ""smoke cleared"" I reached out to the buyer again with no response. Now here we are 18 months later and I get a call from the buyers sister asking for a refund.
What do I do? The car is gone and presumably because said car was never picked up we lost 10's of thousands in the little things that insurance cant replace (not to mention the deductibles, fees, etc....)
I don't know what I should do in this situation, If i can scrounge up some money it is fair to charge him a storage fee for the approx 100 days after the 30 day allowance for storage?

Ebay,Returning a watch that was DOA. Return address is different from the address on the box they shipped me.,"Bought a watch off a seller with ~1200 feedback, 98.7% positive.  It doesn't work, and isn't ""brand new"" like the listing advertised.

Ebay,My experiences buying a used Macbook on ebay - And some questions,"A little background: 

TL;DR below. I am a long time user of ebay, registered since 2002 and sell stuff from time to time. But my account is mainly a buying account.

Recently, after starting selling some items, I had gathered the funds to get a used Macbook (I simply cant afford a new one) after my current macbook is confirmed to be on its way out.

First off, When I browse ebay, I sort results via the newly listed option. Just through habit really, and I've never had a problem with it. So I see the macbook I would like, a 2012 MBA model with only a charger - no big deal, I don't use the superdrive in my current one and it doesn't have a box. I buy it. Pay the seller instantly, and he mails stating the MBA will be posted and arrive by Friday (its monday).

I wait til Friday, nothing arrives, nothing says its been posted (sometimes people don't update this, its fine) so I message seller. Dont hear anything over the weekend.. Monday morning a message appears: ""Sorry, Item will be sent today, had some trouble wiping the data"" After another week of waiting, nothing arrives. I open a case against him as I get no response after another message and I need to wait 8 days before it can be stepped up to ebay customer services. During this time I message him 3 times, asking him to just ""refund me if the item is no longer available and we can move on"".. in the end I waited 22 days to get refunded. 

When I get the money refunded, I decide to buy another Macbook, a 2011 MBA. This time I get no response from seller when asked about delivery, which can be ""normal"". after a week with nothing, I am pretty sure I know whats going to happen. After 20 days, I get refunded. 

So I decide I will try again (If at first you don't succeed, try and try again.. right?)
I buy another, this time I step it up and go for the more expensive 2013 MBA 11"". And here I am, 5 days later.. With no response from the seller.. I know he's buying shit with the money I paid as there are feedbacks being left from after the date of sale on his account.

I just wanted to share this, as this is the reason I am starting to despise ebay now. 3 different sellers, all 100% positive feedback with 500+. The same outcome. 

**TL;DR:** Bought from different sellers, a total of 3 Macbooks. All ended the same: Seller doesn't respond, wait 20+ days to refund. (still waiting on a miracle after 5 days on my current buy with no response)

Now - **The questions!:** 
Has anyone here experienced this as often as I have? 

Does anybody else think ebay is being used like a ""payday loan"" by some folks? 

How can ebay combat this behaviour, and do they set restrictions on people that do this?

Thanks for reading, hopefully you guys can give me faith in this situation. And maybe some buying tips? Or am I just extremely unlucky?

Ebay,"Buyer opens case, never returns item, does CC chargeback, gets money back - Police /Paypal won't do anything, what to do now?","A couple months back I sold a car part on eBay to someone halfway across the country. In the biggest boldest text in the auction description it stated that it would not work with cars that had a certain configuration. Of course the buyer didn't read that, had that config and wanted to return the item even though I had a no return policy due to size and weight (I made almost nothing after shipping).

So eBay grants the return even though I had a no return policy, buyer created a shipping label but never returned the item. A couple weeks later buyer does a chargeback with his CC company and states he never received the item. I upload the tracking info, the screenshots of him signing for it and the return request. He then changes his story and says that the item was not as described, which it was described near perfectly (I have 100% feedback and rarely have returns).

CC company gives him the money back, now he has the item and the money. I then contact his local police dept and they tell me its a ""civil matter"" and then tell me to call my local police dept since the transaction took place at my location. I do so, they say the same thing and that ""this is the cost of doing business ($700+)"" and that their detectives don't have the time to deal with anything under $10,000. Then basically rounded it out that I'd have to sue the guy to get my money back in small claims court.

TL;DR Buyer bought item, received item and then did a CC chargeback and now has money and item.

Ebay,PayPal dispute : Comment suddenly changed !?,"I am in the middle of a dispute with a buyer that claims that I shipped him a broken phone.

In the first message I received via the ""PayPal dispute assistant"", the guy said that he received a broken phone and that he think someone used his PayPal account and scammed him. It was very unclear.

Now, he escalated to a claim and while I was writing an answer, I wanted to quote something he said in the first message. But when I looked at it, his first message was now a completely different message !

I have no idea how, but I wanted to quote the part where he said ""I feel like someone stole my PayPal account"" but the whole message was now different.

It is genuinely the first time I encounter something like that and I am really confused.

Ebay,Store vs Increased Allowed Sales,"I recently signed up for an eBay Store (monthly plan; Premium version) as I'm clearing out some storage and planned sales finally. The per-item listing fee is about half of what it is if you exceed your maximum allowed limit (15Â¢ vs 30Â¢) and, given what I'm looking at in several dozen bankers boxes, I will be in good shape in that regard.

A day or two after I signed up for the Premium Store, I got this email:

&gt; Congratulations! You've been doing a great job selling on eBay, and we've noticed. How would you like to list even more? Now you can.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's how much you can now list every month:
&gt; 
&gt; User ID: ######
&gt; 
&gt; Items: 190 ---&gt; [now] 370
&gt; 
&gt; Amount: $5,000.00
&gt; 
&gt; You can always check how much you've listed so far this month in My eBay.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for being a great seller, and we hope that you'll take advantage of this opportunity to increase your sales.

So does that mean that after I signed up and paid the fee, now they're allowing me more no-fee listings? I still save a % or so (4% to 9% final value fees (FVF) versus the flat 10%, but my initial purge is mostly DVDs and Games, which are the 9% FVF).

I was planning on keeping the subscription for a couple of months; it's going to be covered by the company I work with, so it's not going to hit me personally. To be clear; any profits after supplies &amp; shipping are mine, they're just covering the store fee for me as a favor/perk.

Ebay,Scammed:( Buyer sent back smashed MacBook Pro,"Hi r/ebay,
Unfortunately I have fell victim to a scam. I sold a fully functioning MacBook Pro in mint condition for $520. Shortly after receiving it, the buyer said I did not describe it accurately. He sent back a completely smashed one that did not turn on and had a broken screen. There is no way this laptop could've been damaged so badly inside the box. I told him that for this type of severe damage to happen, it had to have completely torn through the box. He agreed and said it completely tore through the box in shipping. I then asked for the note USPS leaves when a package is torn open, and he ignored that request. Even more suspicious, he originally told me I described it wrong, not that it tore though the box in shipping. I did not purchase insurance, as I was confident I packed it very well.

I clearly state in my description several times that I only ship to US, but these two people keep on bidding on my item from outside the US. I know about the preferences and I set them. 

But out of nowhere, this one guy bid a lot more money than it was previously, and he has no rep, and just created the account (he's from outside the US). It has been 24 hours since I contacted him, and he has not responded. 

Should I be worried? Since he bid so much more money than the bids were at before, should I be worried about a scam?",5,5,2015-05-11,EBAY,0.05615609139204025,0.9017311334609985,0.042112793773412704
Ebay,Getting listings removed for using images without permission. Does anyone have any experience/advice?,"I have a listing which uses a picture I took, and has a watermark of my eBay ID. It's one of my more successful listings, with several thousand sales, and has appeared at or near the top of search result for several years.

I've noticed other sellers using similar keywords to those in my title, but there's not much I can do about this, as I don't own the copyright on individual words.

However, today when I searched for {my listing's title}, I found two listings (not mine) which use my photo (including the watermark of my ID). I know this is against eBay policy; I know I can report them for using my photo without permission; it should be blatantly obvious that they have stolen my image, but I fear that I will report them, and eBay will do nothing.

Does anyone have any experience/advice on the best way to ensure they stop using my photo on their listings?

Ebay,Found a defect after item was sold,"Hello, I recently sold a doll that went for a decent amount and had a few other bidders. The doll I believed to be free of stains, tears, or any other imperfections. For a used item, it is still in great shape. But when I was packing the doll for shipment, I noticed a stain. It definitely isn't a new stain, I just missed it somehow when doing a condition report.

So the buyer paid, and now I have to let them know about this. What would you do in terms of reconciliation? Cancel the sale and relist with the newfound stain in the description? Offer to reimburse them for the difference of their winning bid to the previous bidder? I'm actually shelling out extra money for shipping because insurance drove it up double than what the buyer paid. Should I let them know of this, maybe that would help? 

I'm so upset with myself, I don't want to damage my 100% feedback and I certainly don't want to upset the buyer.

Many thanks in advance for your help!

Ebay,Upset Seller threatens,"Purchased a set of ""original"" dvds for a friend. When it arrived they were DVR copies that could not be read in any of our computers or players.

Ebay,Buyer returned a different item. Is there nothing I can do?,"A buyer returned a different item than the one I sold.  Ebay sided with the buyer.

I have photo proof that the item returned is completely different, color with even a slightly different design pattern.

I called ebay and spoke to some girl with a thick Indian accent and she looked at the pictures I provided, but said there is nothing she could do.  She said its the cost of doing business online.  She said I could report the buyer and if there is a pattern they can suspend the account.   I asked her, so how many times can a buyer steal before you suspend their account, she said that she couldn't provide me with an exact number, it is based on a pattern.  I asked her does the buyer have any reports on his account already, and she told me she is unable to tell me.

Am I truly this powerless?  I'm out the money and the item and I can't do lick about it??????  Do I have any avenue to turn down?

UPDATE 2
 5/14/2015

I just wanted to add an update in case anyone was wondering:

I went to my local police to file a report.
Our police told me I have to file a police report in the buyer town because that is where the crime occurred.

I called his local police station.

They will not let me file a police report over the phone!
The buyer lives half the country away from me!!!  I cannot drive up there and file a report.

I went to the post office to file a fraud complaint, they gave me a website address:
https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/contactUs/filecomplaint.aspx

Alot good that will do.

I also emailed the buyer and uploaded the pictures.
No reply.

Total bullsh!t.
If any good came out of this, its that I just started to sell.  Ebay is totally unsafe.  Its like the wild west from the days of cowboys.  Lawless.

He flat out said NO.
He lectured me saying the the world is full of bad people, what did I expect him to do.
I said give me seller protection, protect me against these types of buyers. He responded that ebay does offer seller protection, and he proceeded to explain that seller protection applies to when you ship to a the address provided and the buyer claims they never received it, you will be protected.
I said how about when the buyer returns a different item.
He told me then its my word against the buyers.
I told him again look at the pictures.
He got angry and asked me if there was anything else he could help me with today.
I told him he didn't help me with this, how could he help me with anything else.

Ebay,"Ebay seller messaged me asking for more $$ to cover shipping, otherwise threatening to cancel order.","So I won an ebay auction that had a reserve for $100, and free shipping. I won the auction at $115. 

Today the seller messaged me this: 

""Hello, I tried shipping out the trophies today and I was wondering if we could compromise. The shipping for both of them is about 45 dollars all together. I was hoping you could help me with shipping cost, or I might have to cancel and return your money. Sorry for the inconvenience. ""

I know that as a buyer if I win an auction and don't pay, I get in trouble and might be banned from future auctions. So is this ok for a seller to do? Isn't it their responsibility to calculate shipping and incorporate that into their prices before hand?

The sellers listed city is within 2 hours of where I live. Should I suggest that he just drive the stuff here to my home? 

I wouldn't mind that- but I am worried for two reasons.

1. I am pretty sure buyer/seller meeting like that is against ebay's rules or something

2. I am afraid he will cancel the order unless I give him more $$, which I do not want to happen. 

Any advice /r/ebay? I figure this guy is new to ebay and doesn't know the ropes. How would I reply to them?

edit: I tried calculating the shipping, and it looks like its considerably less than $45 for shipping. Thoughts?

Ebay,Client submitted charge back on item they received last month.,"Hello all.  

Last month, I sold a brand new iPad mini 3, new in box, with the plastic wrap still on.  Within 12 hours of listing it, it was sold with a buy it now.  I emailed the client stating I would ship it out the next day, which I did.  I shipped it USPS priority shipping with delivery confirmation and signature required.  
I received no communication back from the seller, and they left positive feedback for me withing a few days.  Now, a month later, I just received an email from paypal stating that the client is requesting a charge back because they never authorized the payment.

I uploaded the delivery confirmation, provided the tracking number and attached screenshots of my emails to the buyer to show that I sent the item and that according to USPS it was received.  Now, one interesting thing about how the item was received is that there was no one available to sign for it, so it went to the local post office.  According to the tracking number at USPS, it shows that it was signed for by someone other than what the sellers name was listed as on ebay.

My question is what is the likely outcome of this?  Is there anything that I can do to protect myself and get better chances to win the dispute?  Thanks for all the insight.

If anyone can offer any insight before I phone ebay that would be great as I imagine they won't have a clue what i'm talking about.

I am opted into the GSP and have had 1 sale back before Christmas through it, to put this number into perspective I do about 1500 ebay sales per month on the UK website, so obviously this is an extremely low conversion. 1 out of 8000~ish sales is GSP, so something is not quite right.

*1. Selling an old TI-83 graphing calculator. Should I pad it and put in a flat rate envelope (which would be a bit bulging) for $5... or would a small custom box be more appropriate? 

*2. Selling a folded-up geographic map. It's about the size of a post card when folded. Should I mail in a flat rate envelope for $5? Or secure between some cardboard and mail in generic flat envelope for closer $2? I don't want it to be bent by an auto-sorter... is that a real risk?

The guy is now saying that when he opened his parcel there was just a peice of wood in the box not the graphics card. This is completely untrue. Also the guy did not open his claim with ebay but actually with paypal which is unusual. I have spoken to them both and paypal says he has to get a police report ect for it to be enforcable however I have had some good new from ebay but whether they are successful in looking into it is another question.
When items are sent via global shipping at the ebay global shipping centre in derbyshire they go through a huge x ray machine before being sent and if the item is not what it appears to be it is flagged and checked. I assume this means ebay can prove i did not sent this guy a peice of wood. However they dont seem to think there is a problem as they dont see the case opened on the purchase. Hopefully i can get them to co oberate with paypal. here is a picture of what he claims i sent him.

I called the guy on my phone and he pretended not to know english after i told him who i was. Fortunately i study italian so was able to ask uno problemo un cartamento. and could understand that he said he didnt receive the right item. This guy is 100% not genuine in his claim unless someone at the courier place happened to have this peice of wood in his pocket and swapped it. I find it highly unlikely that the 5.86 an hour warehouse worker would steal a large computer part that could just as well be a doorstop to his untrained eye over a precious counterfeit timex.

Ebay,"Won an appeal against a buyer who abused the returns process, but only because ebay screwed up(?)","*Sorry if this is long but the sequence of events is a bit specific and relevant.*

I sold an item for about $60 in good cosmetic shape and good working order. Buyer sent me a message claiming it was not working and they wanted a refund. I replied twice, they never replied. Then they opened a return, and when I got it back it had been disassembled and smashed back together (it was damaged in a way that would be impossible from shipping damage, and only possible if it was intentionally damaged). I sent them a message with photos of the smashed item and then I escalated the case (no option to add the photos to the return/escalation though), and of course ebay sided with the buyer and took my $60 and refunded them.

Then it goes a bit unexpectedly.

When the escalation closed, I got a message from ebay support saying the typical thing (that in cases like this, they will side with the buyer and there is nothing I can do), but that I can appeal the decision. The message included some very vague instructions on how to appeal it, but they just let me nowhere. I sent a message back asking for clearer instructions on how to appeal and got a reply from a different person at ebay saying ""Unfortunately, eBay does not grant appeals based on the condition of the buyer's return"". I replied to the previous message again, asking again how to file an appeal, and got the same message back from the same 2nd person. This was all up to yesterday.

Today it got weirder. Today I checked the return escalation again and it said that yesterday I had opened an appeal, and then immediately after that, the appeal was closed (still in the buyers favor obviously), *though I never opened an appeal nor had I even figured out how to*. Frustrated, I called ebay just now. The lady was pleasant (and american) but she just reiterated that appeals are final and there is no protection against buyers that abuse the returns system other than to report a buyer. I adamantly refused to take that as an answer, asked why it said I had opened an appeal when I hadn't yet, and asked what the point of an appeal process is if I'm never allowed to add my evidence that the buyer abused the system.  

She ""looked again"" and then said ""oh it looks like this item you used Hassle Free Returns, so let me see if there is something we can do"". Apparently Hassle Free Returns do have some seller protections if the buyers abuse the system, but I am quite sure I am not signed up for Hassle Free Returns. Then she came back on the line and said that ""because I was provided incorrect information by ebay"" that I would get a refund.

Supposedly I'll be getting an email here in a minute to confirm my refund.

Edit: got my refund about 20 hours later. It was definitely not a normal refund and appears to be a manual override by the EBay rep given the circumstance",11,10,2015-05-14,EBAY,0.09517320990562439,0.8734320402145386,0.03139474242925644
Ebay,Buyer buying my item just to leave negative feedback,"Hello,
I bought an item from a fraudulent eBay seller. After having a flaming war he decided to refund my money. I left him negative feedback as you guys said. This morning he left a feedback revision request and I denied. Now he made a second ebay account (i know this as the shipping address is the same as his) to buy one of my items.

I open a case to cancel the transaction. Note that I haven't received any payment, and don't want to. He messaged back that he still wants the item and denies my cancellation. 

eBay states the case is closed and I should ""complete the transaction"" and that I will not be issued a final fee credit.

How am I obligated to complete the transaction? I have not received payment because the buyer cannot process payment.

Ebay,I wish eBay would enforce the distinction between used and broken items. I hate plowing through pages of SHIT to find the lowest price on WORKING items.,"It just makes me want to never shop on eBay when the ratio of shit:good stuff is higher than on Craigslist. The thing is there's certainly a market for broken items. I've sold SO MANY broken piece of shit laptops, ipods, camera lenses, printers, you name it, AND I got more than I thought I would. On every listing I always made it very clear in the title, description, if possible a photo or ten, and most importantly the CONDITION selector, that the items were not functional in some way. What's funny is that people who are capable of repairing that stuff and *want* to find that stuff are probably also somewhat annoyed that they have to dig through working items to find what they need. 


**eBay needs to do two things to fix this:**

* 1) Make the condition the first thing sellers have to specify(EVEN BEFORE THE ITEM), and **make it clear** after they select anything that's not ""Parts - Not working"", that what they're selling is completely functional, and that repeated listings of parts or non-functional items to areas where people are expecting to find items that work, will result in a ban. 

* 2) Enforce it. Remove the stinking hordes of listings that are for broken items from the ""used"" area.",12,9,2015-05-17,EBAY,0.05951255187392235,0.914768397808075,0.025719054043293

However, Buyer's inquiries became more demanding -- multiple ""what is shipping cost!"" emails -- and following with messages such as: ""Don't forget I have 3. Items to rate you on. Bla. Bla !"" ""Last chance to respond!!!"" and ""Hello I am very disappointed that you have responded to me. **Don't worry I will take care of you later. When I will rate you late** have a nice day."" 

That last message indicates to me that, regardless of receipt of the items, buyer will give a negative feedback regardless of expeditious shipment (I packaged and shipped the items tonight after receipt of payment), answering all questions (within a short time of receiving them), and acting well within eBay guidelines for shipment (shipment fees established during eBay checkout). 

I've reported all that to eBay. FWIW, I have 100% feedback with about 800 ratings. 

However, if I cancel the win and refund the PayPal transaction, can the buyer still leave negative feedback? Or, as I've reported it, should I just leave it alone for now and see how things pan out?",6,3,2015-05-17,EBAY,0.07165109366178513,0.9001368284225464,0.02821212261915207
Ebay,"""Your Listings Have Been Ended""","I've been an eBay member for a few years now but recently began selling frequently this past month. A few days ago, I received a message from eBay saying my listings have been ended because they did not: have a clear description, pictures or an accurate title. The listings were of kid's Elmo books, and they had (at least I though) clear pictures, titles and descriptions. I brushed it off seeing as they were small items and did not really care if they sold or not. 

Now today, I've gotten 4 emails saying that my listings have been ended. I received two emails early this morning, and it turns out two of my listings (one of a Guitar Hero controller for Wii, and another a Men's Ralph Lauren shirt) had been ended. The strange thing is the emails do not say what items had been ended (whereas the first email I got regarding the Elmo books had the Auction titles and numbers in the message.) I logged into eBay and that's how I determined what items had been ended. Now within the past two hours I have received two more messages from eBay saying my listings had been ended, with no items listed in email. I logged into eBay and all my open sales are still ongoing so I'm a little confused as to what's going on.

SO...I'm wondering if anyone has an idea of what's happening here. I'm not sure if this is important, but the items that were removed were all listed as Best Offers instead of Auction style. Would eBay remove an item because they think that the Best Offer price you placed is too high? I wouldn't think so. I re-listed the Controller and Shirt as an auction and so far they are still up. Also, is it eBay themselves seeing these items and removing them, or could someone potentially be reporting my items? If this keeps happening I will contact eBay, but I wanted to hear if you had any advice or have also received these emails of ended listings with no item in the message.

Ebay,Pretty sure I have $1000 of counterfeit items in route to me... would like advice,"10 days ago I purchased a large lot on eBay that had multiples of the same item. It was a pretty good deal, I spent about $1000 on it with plans to resell a lot of it. Seller had well over 1000 feedback, was active and had 99+% feedback. Item was listed as in the US and USPS for shipping. Cool.

Day after I paid they marked shipped. No tracking update. After 5 days I messaged them, and they gave me a DHL shipping number that is coming from Hong Kong. Oh shit #1. It was supposed to be delivered tomorrow but is still at port. Oh shit #2. Today I went to check on the listing to get some information from it and it has been removed by eBay and they are saying not to pay for it if I haven't yet. Oh shit #3. 

DHL is listing Tuesday as a probable delivery date. I found a few posts on eBay forums with people complaining that this particiular item has had a lot of fakes coming out of Hong Kong. I'm wondering what to do, I obviously don't want the items if they are fakes with the money I'm spending on them, but not sure how to proceed since the item doesn't exist on eBay anymore.

He made his account today...... also, the full name/ address are identical, but his actual account name is different with each purchase.

And then I got the email where he asks for my personal email

""kindly send me your paypal email address or your paypal money request,so that i can make instant payment and the total amount of the item""

Ebay,Baffled by this buyer. (Negative feedback story),"I was selling a Mid-2014 13"" Macbook Pro for $999 plus free shipping and shipping insurance and all that good stuff. 

It had a 14 day return policy. 

Once the buyer paid, I shipped it out on the same day and spent a good $50 in shipping to make sure it was sent out quickly and safely. I updated the tracking immediately on eBay of course.

Package gets to this guy the VERY next day. He lives about two hours away from me, but shipping it through UPS saved me time and money as well as showing that the package was indeed delivered.

It had signature confirmation delivery. The person signed for it. 

28 days later, I get negative feedback from this guy.

""THIS SELLER IS A SCAM ARTIST""

I'm absolutely confused, what happened? I contact them through eBay. They are already past their initial 14 days, but I'd like to resolve any issues they may be having.

Seller is silent, no responses.

I do a bit of investigating and I found out he left a review on the product page: 

&gt;""This seller must have swapped out the hard drive the performance is not what it should be for a Mac I think my iPhone 4 had more memory than what this seller put inside. This seller is a scammer.""

Excuse me?

I could totally understand if within the 14 days they did a refund, but they waited this long to say there was an issue? 

Why would they wait this long? Did they break the laptop and decide to try to deceive eBay into forcing a refund? 

I'm really confused by this. It's really bothering me since I only have about 20 reviews on my account and this takes a pretty big hit (4.5%). Now I no longer have a perfect rating and a buyer that refuses to be in contact with me to resolve their issue. 


If I don't get any trouble from the seller IE legal issues, then I'll probably let this slide and have it irritate me for the rest of my eBay account's lifespan. I'll still try to fight with eBay about having the rating on my account, though.

Ebay,New eBay seller here. A couple questions that I'm concerned about.,"I recently listed an item on eBay. My first one actually. It sold within one day of listing it, one night actually. I received an email from the buyer asking if I could send it internationally. He said he would, along with already having paid for the item, give me 500 dollars. I'm not sure if this is legit or not. 

He did pay for the item, I've check my PayPal account and it says ""payment pending"". 

I was confused about payment pending but I did a little more than quick Google search and it appears that PayPal holds the money for 21 days or until 3 days after the package has been received by the buyer. Is that true? 

And if I'm sending it internationally will I still be able to receive confirmation that the package has been "" received""?

Do you guys think this is legit or not? I did receive the payment so it might be legit?

EDIT: I'm thinking this may be unlegit. Very unlegit. If the money in ""pending"" in my PayPal account, can I just not doing anything and it will go back to the buyer? Or is there something I have to do to refund the buyers money? I only ask this because I just read something about people preying on new eBay sellers, especially when it comes to cell phones.

Ebay,Buyer is holding feedback at ransom for partial refund,"Recently, I've sold a Playstation One mini with an LCD Screen.  I know this unit was immaculate and working when I sent it.  However, according to the customer, upon arrival the unit had deep gashes on it that were not there when I shipped the item  (I am assuming the buyer negligently opened the package with a knife).  The buyer demanded a 50% refund or a replacement.  

Because I had another like-item laying around I decided to swap out the units upon arrival of the gashed original.  Judging by this customer's actions in the first step, I carefully tested this item again by playing a game on it for over a half hour to make sure that nothing could go wrong.

Yet, it did go wrong.  The item arrived to the customer today and he is claiming that the screen is flickering.  He said he can't get a picture to show me the damages because they happen so fast.  I went far out of my way to carefully bubble wrap this item, there is no way it got damaged in shipping.

Now, he is ""demanding"" a 50% refund and clearly stating that if I do not comply he will leave me negative feedback.  

I am wondering since he did state an ""or else"" statement demanding an exact refund that I had never agreed upon previously how legal this is.  Is there a way I can go to ebay saying that this customer is holding me ""ransom""?  Or should I bite the bullet and refund him to save my feedback reputation?  Perhaps, if I work with him and settle for a lesser partial refund and he DOES leave me negative feedback do you think I'll have the tools to contact ebay and have them remove it?

Advice please, greatly appreciated.  Thanks.",7,2,2015-05-20,EBAY,0.09831330925226212,0.8573013544082642,0.04438535124063492

Ebay,Buyer claims I sent him a broken item which he clearly smashed himself. WTD?,"Buyer sends me a message about the item asking if he could BIN for $90 shipping included. I decline knowing the item (vintage large Harley Davidson lava lamp) is worth more. He gets into a bidding war with another member and the item sells for $107.50 + $25 for shipping in his favor.

I sent a message to the buyer asking for proof so I could open a case with USPS (which I know I wouldn't be able to do but wanted to see if he would respond) and he sent me a picture of the thing completely shattered as if he took a damn hammer to it! There was no box in sight and all that was there was the smashed base of the lamp laying on top of a piece of the shipping paper with the pile of bubble wrap that was around it left to the side. The light bulb that was inside was taken out possibly so it wouldn't bust when he broke the lamp, I have no clue. It was a beautiful lamp and now it's completely destroyed clearly over buyers remorse and I'm sick over the whole issue. Should I contact eBay about what's going on or would it even be worth it?

Ebay,Will accepting an item not as described return effect my seller ratings?,"So basically I sold a vintage item to a buyer who is clearly experienced in the rules of eBay. After receiving the item the buyer messaged me saying a part of the item was damaged and then gave me a choice. They wanted me to help with the cost of replacing the part or they would return the item through eBay returns. I told them to send it back to me and I would issue a full refund. The buyer has now opened an ebay returns request with the reason being that the item didn't match the listing.

I have no problem accepting a return, even paying for the return shipping without a fight because the item is fairly valuable. However I disagree with their reason. I took quality photos of the item, and the buyer and I even discussed the condition of the part they had issues with before the purchase was made.

My question is if I accept the INAD return, will it effect my seller ratings? I know I have to accept the return, but I really feel like this buyer was trying to game the system to force me into giving a discount after the fact. I believe the item was described accurately.

Ebay,Buyer received broken expensive item - what are my options as a seller?,"Hi there,

I'm not sure what to do. I sold my mint condition iMac on eBay and had it packed &amp; shipped by UPS (with the declared value listed at the selling price of $1000+). 

The buyer received it completely broken and smashed on one side (and even proceeded to send a picture AND call me directly as soon as he submitted his refund request - which was a little startling).

I've never experienced this before - what are my options and any idea how this will go? The buyer is supposedly handing the iMac back to UPS today, and I submitted a claim at the UPS Store that packed and shipped it by giving them the value of the iMac, the refund request, and receipts from me purchasing their pack &amp; ship services. I'm very worried at the same time that I may be being scammed and the buyer might be trying to replace a smashed iMac for free. Fortunately, I do have the serial number of the iMac I shipped. What's the best way for me to proceed? Note that I have not issued a refund yet since I don't immediately know the whereabouts of my iMac. Did I botch the process so far?

Ebay,Buy now fees insanely high. How make a profit and stay competitive?,"So I've been wanting to get into buying and selling numismatic coins. Most of the more active sellers on ebay use 'buy now' rather than bids. So I wanted to put a couple of coins on ebay at somewhat the same prices they did, calculated the absolute minimum worth, added transportation costs etc. Then when I submitted 130 euros worth of coins it says that if sold the ebay commission would be like 10-30 euros, can't remember the exact number. So even with my transport costs being lower than my competitors, when I subtract ebay's commission I would be selling at a loss. Or I could include the commission in the price to compensate, but then the price would be higher than that of my competition. Dispite me buying those coins at the same prices as everyone else.

How do other people do this? Obviously you can try to buy things at lower prices, but with ebay's fees that high, why bother unless it's really rare stuff? And sadly if you use bidding you'll make less sales in coins, I've noticed. Buy now sells more, but the fees just don't make it attractive to me.

2-buyer opened a INAD return case for a Sony disc man I sold.  The cd player was tested and worked great.  I messaged them a response to see if they had left the ""hold"" switch in place,  which would cause the problems he was describing.  I got no response,  later that day I issued a full refund.  EBay suggested I include instructions next time to aid buyers in using my product.  

3-Buyer opened a INAD return because he ""checked off the wrong box"". EBay was able to remove the defect on this but I had to call and point them towards the message where he admitted it was a mistake.  

I guess I'm reaching out to you guys for some advice.  I'm already sending out messages after purchase to let them know any special instructions and an estimated delivery date.

Ebay,Advice - buyer claiming item is faulty,"Hi

I recently sold a car radio on eBay about a month ago. The buyer left positive feedback and I assumed everything was fine. Today he messaged me saying he has just fitted it and the screen is too dim and only gets a little bit brighter if he changes the settings. He has compared it to his friends car with the same radio in it and says the friend's radio screen is much brighter.

So I replied saying okay and asked him what car he put the radio in to and gave him some reasons why his might not be as bright as his friend's. He replied saying he fitted it into a Seat Leon when it came out of my VW Golf! He claimed he asked a car dealer who said it was compatible with his Leon.

There is some info on the internet stating that in some cases the unit might need its software changing etc to be fully compatible with a different make of car but he is just keeps stating that it is faulty.

My question is that do I have a leg to stand on? Will eBay rule that I have to refund him? I advertised the radio as a VW one and nowhere in my listing did I say it was compatible with any other make of car. If he had asked me before he purchased it if were compatible with a Seat Leon, I would have advised him against buying it as I couldn't be sure it was compatible.

I really don't want to refund him as I am 100% certain it was fine before I sent it off.

Ebay,"Friend used account, left me with a few grand in sellers fees (X-post /r/legaladvice)","I am located in Michigan. My best friend of 15 years, best man at my wedding, and practically a brother to me appears to be trying to screw me. 

He came to me a few months back asking to use my eBay account. I obliged under the condition he use his own PayPal account. For a few months there were no issues, he was using the account and paying all the selling fees. Then I received a call from eBay saying they were restricting my account. EBay's reason was because my account was linked to a suspended account.

I asked my friend if he knew anything about his and he played dumb. EBay ended up giving me more info and I did my own digging; long story short the account was my friends and he was playing dumb. It was at this point that I felt like something shady was happening. 

I called up eBay and explained the situation and asked them to lock my account. I wanted to keep him out of it without telling him I locked it myself--strictly because I was afraid he would bail on paying fees. 

I called him and explained eBay locked the account to continue their investigation into the linked accounts. He was upset since he was selling a good volume of items but without me mentioning the fees he said he would take care of them. 

Just yesterday I received an email from eBay that they could not withdraw the funds from PayPal. Now I am worried eBay will come after me because the account is in my name. I am hoping the fact that all of the transactions occurred via his PayPal will help me out. I mentioned it to him and he said something about PayPal screwing things up, promised to call me later. 

At this point its not a given that he has bailed on paying but his shady behavior and lies lead me to believe he has no intention of making good with eBay. What can I do to ensure eBay doesn't come after me?",9,4,2015-05-25,EBAY,0.06442081183195114,0.9054555892944336,0.030123570933938026
Ebay,[PSA] Customer support CAN be VERY helpful... if you get the right representative.,"I'm just writing this to let you know that eBay's customer support is incredibly inconsistent. One representative may say ""sorry, there is nothing I can do"", while the next one might say ""sure, let me take care of that for you."" I've had this happen on multiple occasions, mostly for getting BS defects (that were out of my control) removed. I've seen sellers with thousands of transactions, tons of negative feedback.. yet have 5 stars across the board. We all know that's virtually impossible, and they brown nose customer support to protect their DSR.


Tips:

- I often find male representatives to be more helpful. Not sure if this is because I am female or not (lol).

- I rarely get my issues solved on the first call. If the first rep isn't helpful; hang up, call back, and speak to a different rep.

- Get personal. Ask how their day was. Call them by their name. All those little things can make their day (and helpfulness) a little better!

- Let them know how important their help is. I always mention how much I appreciate it. Niceness can go a long way.

- Never give up. Persistence is key.

Good luck! Happy selling!",1,3,2015-05-25,EBAY,0.1281919926404953,0.8406255841255188,0.031182341277599335
Ebay,Paypal holding funds?,"Hi,

*But the item is defective. And I am returning to you.
Besides Paypal has a much bigger, 180 days window for me to dispute and I have already found my transaction there.
If you want be to believe there is nothing you could do, I have to go ahead and take steps here to resolve the issue.
I will also revise the feedback I left here on eBay.*

Reading the advice here in the subreddit, I think I just need to see what the buyer does next. Is that the correct thinking?",24,18,2015-05-28,EBAY,0.09457921981811523,0.8747138381004333,0.030706925317645073

Ebay,"Made a stupid Mistake, Got scammed, Having a harder time than I thought I would cleaning it up - Please Help?","I (stupidly) bought a couple watches from a guy that were priced very low.  The guy had 38 feedback so I took the risk knowing it might be a scam when I should have right away KNOWN it was a scam.  Anyways, soon after purchasing them eBay removed the listings and it now reads ""We had to remove this listing from the site and you're not required to complete the transaction...BlahBlahBlah"" in my purchase history where the items used to be.  This means, I would assume, that eBay knows it is a scam and removed it for that reason.

Maybe I should have waited and perhaps I took the wrong course of action but I opened item not received cases for both transactions, and eBay closed the cases.

The cases read:  ""Your request was closed because we didn't hear from you. If you have a request open for 30 days and we don't hear from you, we'll close the request.""

In reality, I was never prompted to contact eBay again after submitting the case and it was not closed after 30 days but in fact only 3 days.

I have tried contacting eBay through the resolution center but I keep on getting sent in a circular loop of putting in my problem then being told the case was closed.  I cannot dispute through PayPal it seems either because PayPal simply redirects me to eBay and tells me there is already a case open (even though they're already closed).  This is very frustrating because eBay makes it seem as though the buyer protection guarantee is a very easy process to go through with.  There seems to be no way to contact a human and when I emailed PayPal I received a useless automated reply.

Please help me and tell me what my next course of action should be.

Ebay,Account permanently suspended right after registration without even single signing in,"I registered on eBay in 2010 and never even logged in. After one month I got the message that my account is suspended. The reason is ""eBay took this action after determining that your account was acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies. ""

Since I never planned to use eBay, I just ignored that message and sent them a bug report about this issue.

Now, 5 years later I decided to buy a plotter through eBay and tried to unsuspend my account. When I use email support they say that I need to prove my address by uploading two documents. Unfortunately I already live in another country, but there is no way to change account details (address) if it is suspended. When I call to their phone support, they say that there is no way to unsuspend my account (permanent suspension) and they can't tell the reason.

Did anyone have this kind of issues?

It looks unfairly because I really didn't sell or buy anything, I asked the phone support and they confirmed, that there was no activity in my account before it was suspended, so the account was not hacked.

In addition, according to eBay FAQ, my wife and other family members will also be suspended if they try to register. That is double unfair, I think.

Ebay,"Buyer did not read item description, requested refund. Item already shipped out.","I don't run a store front or anything. I started selling my random junk sitting around in closets and attics a while back, and started getting good at selling my own stuff. Eventually I had friends and family ask me about it and I offered to sell their things for them, no commission or anything. Just to be nice and help them out.

So, I sold a pair of Rx sunglasses last night. Buyer did a Buy It Now, so as soon as I woke up this morning, I packaged up the item, took photos of the packaging (I always do this even with insurance protection just to cover my bases), and took it right out to USPS for Priority Shipping.

I get an email from the buyer a couple hours later asking me for a refund because they looked over the item again and didn't realize the lenses were Rx. I do write up terms for my auction, which include to make sure they have read the complete item description before they bid and that I don't do refunds based on the buyer deciding they bid on the wrong item. This isn't a business for me. In this case, I already sent the funds over to my friend who I was selling the glasses for, so I don't have the money at this point anyways.

In any case, I replied to the buyer and explained I could not do a refund based on the terms of my auction, but suggested they could attempt to re-sell them if they'd like and possibly get more than what they paid for them, and gave them permission to re-use the photos I took of them, as sort of a consolation, I suppose.

Thankfully if the buyer tries to break them and file an item damaged claim, I took thorough photos of the packaging ahead of time, even though it was insured and I'm technically covered. The item has tracking so there's no fear of filed claim for ""item not received"". And as far as I know, this buyer has no other basis they could make a claim on. The item was described accurately.

The thing I'm concerned about is that the buyer is going to leave me unfair negative feedback. My rating is currently at 100%, and I take a lot of pride in keeping it that way.

Does any one have any experience in dealing with a begrudged buyer who wasn't allowed a refund simply because they decided later that wasn't the item they wanted, who left them unfair feedback? Is there any way to get eBay to side with the seller on this matter should it happen?

Thanks, everyone.

EDIT:

The posting was listed ""Rx Sunglasses,"" (as Rx is generally well known as an abbreviation for prescription, and is 10 characters less in length) so the buyer responded saying that they didn't realize Rx meant prescription, and had to Google it to find that fact out, and that I shouldn't just assume everyone knows that to be the case. So, I imagine that if I don't allow them to return the item to me, they'll be able to successfully win a refund claim based on that. Due to that and to the suggestions the few of you left, I told them to send the item back to me and I would refund them upon receipt.

Ebay,Ebay problems. Im a first-time seller and I'm getting scammed by buyers?,"Okay, so I've been trying to sell my IPad mini 3 for awhile. It retails for $729 and I've been either selling it for around 700-740 BIN or $550 starting auction price. 

The first time someone bought it out for $740. After ebay congratulated me, the buyer messaged me a detailed list of instructions about the payment method and I thought everything was good. 

Then I get an email from ebay saying:
""We had to cancel bids and purchases on the following item(s) for the buyer, , because they were made without the account owner's permission:""

I was pissed and confused at first, bunt I just figured that the buyer decided not to buy it anymore. So I'm confused what I'm supposed to do because it still lists as being ""Sold"" on y ebay desk and I don't want to face any fees or negative feedback


So anyways, I relisted the item a few more times. I relisted it as a starting auction and another time separately as BIN or Best offer. Someone bought it today at my BIN price (which was 700). I contacted them, thanking them. And I sent them two invoices (because I forgot to include my preferred payment method in the first one). Its been like 6 hours now, and I haven't heard of any contact. The guy has a gold start next to his name and a 10, which is the most basic buying level I think. Am I getting screwed again?  Could he/she have accidentally bought it? 


I also have an auction up rn for the product (just in case). I have 4 days left for it. Theres been 7 watchers and 69 views and one bid (at the starting price of $550).

Ebay,What kind of note do you include in your packages?,"Being both a seller and buyer, I was curious what you guys included in your packages (in terms of thank you notes). I often sell merchandise from comics/games, and I enjoy drawing, so I usually draw a little character on a note based on what they bought!",19,8,2015-05-31,EBAY,0.04755460098385811,0.9255186915397644,0.02692672424018383
Ebay,eBay Seller/Competitor Ended My Higher Ranked Fixed Price Listing,"I use the app quantity manager to keep the shown inventory low (but higher than any one buyer has ever purchased in the history of the listing to avoid it ending -- it's a product that you wouldn't buy more than one, maybe two of). A couple days ago, a seller who sells the same product for a higher price and had a lower search rank for the product used an alternate account to buy all the stated remaining quantity, and then immediately requested to cancel the order. I know it's the rival seller because the email address matches the rival account's username. This ended my listing and thus killed my search rank. 

Now I could use my second account to do the same to him, but I'm not going to stoop to that level. I don't want to send him a message confronting him, because we all know how eBay idiots react and he will probably deny it and report me to eBay for ""harassing messages"". I doubt eBay would do anything, but is there a channel for reporting unfair competitive practices such as this?",8,3,2015-05-31,EBAY,0.6086261868476868,0.3737882673740387,0.017585519701242447

Ebay,Seller listed item as something it wasn't and shipped before I payed. What's the right thing to do?,I bid on a Chromebook. It was listed as an Acer C740. I won the auction. I went to pay and saw that the color and hinges were wrong. It was actually an older model c720. I asked the buyer who said he listed it as what he thought it was and conceded it might be a 720 and if I don't want it after I receive it he'll take it back. I said I don't want it at all and told him to cancel the sale. But he shipped it before I payed. I don't know why.

Ebay,My inkjet died. Should i upgrade to Thermal or Laser?,"99% of everything i print is ebay and amazon shipping labels. I can pick up a cheap inkjet at walmart for $25, but I've thought about upgrading to a thermal printer but i'm so unfamiliar with them. I can't even find a local place that carries them for sale. Stamps.com has a cheap $80 one. 

What are everyones thoughts? what do i need to know about using a thermal printer? why do some take different label sizes? what do you guys use and what is the benefit?

I feel i waste  a lot of money on tape and ink. I waste money on tape because i have to stick the label on the packages. I feel a thermal printer will save me some cash on tape.",15,2,2015-05-31,EBAY,0.022194592282176018,0.9348403811454773,0.042965009808540344

Ebay,Best way to protect my self when selling my iPhone?,"I usually sell on my phones on Swappa but it seems device sale values are a lot less lately so I decided I'm just gonna sell my iPhone 6 on eBay since there going for 1.5x or more then prices on Swappa. 

I haven't used eBay to sell stuff in years and forgot some of the scams people do. I remember not doing the transaction out eBay, ship with a tracking number, and ship with insurance.

Are there any new scams I can protect my self from or should watch out for?

And should I ship internationally? I heard that people have problems with there customs or know tricks that makes packages have no record of being delivered and some other stuff.",3,1,2015-05-31,EBAY,0.0341474749147892,0.9204936027526855,0.045358940958976746
