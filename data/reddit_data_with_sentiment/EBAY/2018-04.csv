Ebay,Whats the best day to end auctions?,Hey guys.  I was just wondering what is the best day to end auctions?

Ebay,Negative feedback removal time?,"Hi all.

TL:DR. Had a customer that committed mail fraud and threatened to kill me 2 years ago. They have continually harassed me and made threats against me. They had their eBay account banned, and created new one and purchased from me again.

eBay CS told me to cancel, I did (problem's with buyer's address) Buyer then proceeded to leave negative feedback. I called eBay, and they said they were removing. Hours later, nothing, so I called again, same story.


It's been about 20 hours, and it's still there. Any ideas on how long it takes now?

Ebay,Is this legit?,"I've been been keeping my eyes peeled for a good deal on a certain higher-price item and have been running into an awful lot of weird listings from the same user (actually a couple users, but they are listed in the same city and are so similar I'm convinced they're the same). 

Basically, the items are listed for bid with an absurdly low starting price, but then when you click ""see full description,"" it takes you to a new page with a giant banner ad saying ""eBay Daily deals! This item is only available for fast sale! All bids will be removed!"" etc., and lists the buy it now price as $2000 or whatever. Underneath that banner is text describing each item, which seems to be legit...they all go into good detail and were obviously written by a real person. Both of the two users I've seen selling items this way have a 100% rating. I bid on one of them for $7 or something, and obviously I'm not expecting to actually win—or if I do win, to actually receive it—but the bid hasn't been removed yet. 

Basically I'm just wondering if anyone knows if this is legit in terms of eBay's policies. It seems like kind of an abuse of the site, given that sellers have the option to list an item at a set price without resorting to creating a BS auction. It's making my searching awfully annoying.",3,3,2018-04-01,EBAY,0.0432448536157608,0.9281007647514343,0.028654394671320915

Ebay,well it finally happened...Return request resulted in getting an empty box back.,"tl;dr - Buyer bought item, complained about something specifically pointed out in description, ebay told me new policy is ""you must accept any return opened as 'item not described' and can appeal later for return shipping refund, received empty box back so small the original item couldn't even actually fit in.

I've been waiting almost a decade for this to finally happen. I've had oddly good luck when it comes to shady stuff being pulled on me, but this weekend I finally got the empty box return pulled on me.

Sold an item, listing was up for over a year. Used electronic item. A quote from my listing:

""All items have been inspected and tested to verify they are fully functional, however we make no guarantee for the batteries! Batteries have been charged overnight and verified to hold a charge for at least 5 hours.

Buyer should assume batteries need to be replaced regardless.""

after they received the item they complained the batteries did not hold a charge for more than 2 hours. This listing was over a year old, I never make any promises on batteries because I've learned the hard way, but fine. Tried offering to pay half the price of replacement batteries since I stated the above quote, but they rejected it and insisted I did not sell as described since I claimed they were tested to hold for 2 hours. You win some you lose some, I never argue with a customer regardless of the situation. Spoke with ebay (I already knew the situation since I accept returns, but I always call ebay to discuss any and all cases no matter what, you should do this too!) and it came down to ""they win the initial return and you need to pay return shipping, but you can appeal the return shipping cost later""

Side note: the ebay rep told me theres been a recent change in policy in that if a buyer opens a case stating ""item not as described"", regardless of any and all factors, ebay will side with the buyer and make the seller accept the return. Word for word he openly stated they will *always* side with buyers now. As sellers, our options are to comply with the return then appeal the case to try and get the cost of return shipping back, but there's no stopping the actual return now. Don't know how accurate that is as I haven't been keeping up, but that was jarring.

Anyway, got the return back saturday. A very beat up small flat rate box showed up that was extremely light, I get packages regularly so didn't register what it was for a moment, just thought ""odd, I don't remember ordering anything this small...and its so light?"" then opened it to discover it was completely empty. Then I noticed the label said it was a return and suddenly realized what I was dealing with. This box is so small the original item couldnt even fit into it.

Going to contact USPS for weight verification tomorrow, then call ebay and see what I can do. I know some of you have had luck with that so maybe I'll get lucky. Not overly mad, like I said before you win some you lose some, but it's aggravating, and I figured i'd share",16,15,2018-04-02,EBAY,0.10162436962127686,0.8674877882003784,0.030887851491570473
Ebay,Buyer sending incomprehensible messages 24 days after package received. Afraid of an INAD scam in the making. What can I do?,"Hi there, I will try to keep this as short and concise as possible, but it's a bit complicated. Any help is appreciated. 

In the beginning of March, a listing of mine of a lot sold as an auction. I was paid and everything seemed fine. I just received a message, 24 days after the item was marked as ""Delivered at Desk"", with messages I cannot understand. I think they may be Spanish or French speaking, but are attempting English unsuccessfully. I did not ship out of the country.

I THINK they are saying an item is missing, which I know it was not.  I have been asking several people to read the message they sent for a possible translation.

What they might be saying:

A) They are saying that a major item is missing, which would significantly alter the weight of the package and would only be missing if the package was tampered with. This piece filled a good amount of space in the package and would cause everything else to move around very insecurely, most likely resulting in damage. I have a tracking slip with weight insured for $400.

B) They are saying a small part of the major item in scenario a is missing. I specifically noted in my description that not all sets are completed, and showed a photo with what it came with. The item they are saying is missing is not shown in the photo.

C) They are saying a small item is missing. I looked through my buyer's ebay feedback history and ebay ""recently sold"" listings of a similar item. I see that a similar, but incomplete item was sold by Seller A. Seller A left feedback on my Buyer's account shortly after the sell date of said similar item. This is giving me the feeling the Buyer purchased my lot and are trying to ""cherry pick"" the small item to complete their set they purchased from Seller A and get a refund for the rest. The small item is a fairly rare item, apparently, and I do not see many sold as of late and they go for a decent chunk of change.

I have called eBay customer service, and the person I got on the phone said that they cannot understand the messages. They suggested I not take any action or further respond unless the buyer tries to further communicate. If they still are incomprehensible, they said to tell the buyer to contact eBay directly, as they would have a Spanish translator by April 11th (???) , which is after the 30 day mark for the buyer.

What should I do? I do not want to be left out of the discussion, as I would like to try to resolve this and not lose out on the sale. I have been trying my best to get this buyer to efficiently describe what the issue is, but I'm still left clueless by their messages.

Would eBay even look at something like I brought up with Scenario C? I know eBay sides with the buyer usually and INAD claims usually leave the seller SOL, but isn't it sketchy that the ONE item that might be missing is the one that fits with their previous purchase?

Should I just assume I'm going to be refunding this sale eventually?

Ebay,"My brother want to buy a car from ebay, want to make sure it's not a scam, can anyone read this email?","&gt;Hello,

&gt;I have tried to tell the shipping company to let you see the car but they told me that they don't allow viewers and they're not a showroom.
You can contact them at [email] for more info.They are also idle due the eater holidays until tomorow.

&gt;If there is anything you dont like about the car and decide not to keep it, tough i doubt that since the car is in great shape, you can send it back through the same delivery company and the taxes will go all on my expense.

&gt;I will need your full info (name,full adress,phone number and ebay username if you have one) to forward it to ebay. You will receive a notification from them shortly after that, among with the instructions to follow and the invoice as well.

&gt;For the payment you will be guided to deposit the money to an random eBay bank account. The money will be held and locked untill you have received and agreed to keep the vehicle. That is how their buyer protection policy works.I will be glad knowing that they store the funds for me until then. That is my insurance.

&gt;I will start the shipping right away after I have confirmation from eBay that the funds have reached their account. The car will be brought to your address in 5 working days the most. You will have a 15 days inspection period starting at the arrival.

&gt;When you decide to keep the car,you will have to authorize eBay to release the funds to my bank account, and the transaction will be completed. In case you won't be satisfied with the car, you will be able to send it back through the same shipping company(all on my expense) and be fully refunded by ebay,though I am sure you will love the car.

&gt;If you wish to proceed with the purchase, please provide me the previous mentioned info so I can initiate the deal right away. If you do not have an eBay account this is not an issue, we can do business through my account; as my buyer you will be fully covered by them. Or if you want feedback on eBay, you can sign up with eBay in your country, it is very easy and free and you can have an instant eBay user name.

&gt;I hope I have explained everything to you all right. 

&gt;Kind regards, 
[name]

Ebay,Help. Buyer freezes PayPal payment weeks after posting.,"Hi.
I recently sold a tshirt on eBay, my eBay account, and the payment went to my wife's PayPal. It cleared and we withdrew it.
Today my wife got a email saying that the buyer disputes authorising the payment and we had a few days to reply or we would owe the amount paid. I didn't get anything from ebay.
We logged into her PayPal and disputed this, entered the tracking info etc, which proved it was delivered. PayPal advised they will review over 30 days.
I cannot open a dispute on eBay because they have it parked that it's been paid.
I have the buyers phone number, so I watsapped them a photo of the tracking page and asked them to reverse the dispute.
Any advice? Any idea the likely outcome?
I'd like to point out that this is UK seller to UK buyer however the amount disputed is in HKD. The buyer appears English born, and its his email address attached to the PayPal, however not his name.",8,5,2018-04-02,EBAY,0.0969332605600357,0.8785632252693176,0.024503473192453384

Ebay,New eBay INAD return policy? Seems very open to scams,"Just got off the phone with an eBay rep, and if I understood him correctly, there's a new policy for returns that's pretty open to scammers. 

So what happened to me was someone opened a wrongful INAD case. (Item I sold for parts that was not working exactly as described in my description, and labeled as ""for parts"" under condition. He even wrote in the return ""I didn't see that it was for parts"")

I called eBay and they said I was in the right and they would close the return. Few days pass and instead of it closing, I get an email saying that they've provided a label to the buyer.

I call confused to see what happened, and the rep told me that new policy doesn't allow reps to change INAD cases to remorse cases anymore. Instead they're opting for just giving a label to customer anyways and adding it to your invoice anyways. Once you receive it YOU have to call eBay again and they'll refund you for the price of label after the fact...


Has anyone seen this mentioned anywhere? Why would they do it this way? It means the buyer gets a free label no matter what, even if eBay knows that they are wrong. And if you forget to call when you receive your item back, you foot the bill for return shipping EVEN when you talk to an eBay rep and he says the buyer was wrong, and if you do call eBay just gives credit towards your invoice. Worst part is if you accept no returns on an item, even more than before it basically means nothing, because you can't even call an eBay rep and try and work it out. 

Seems bad for both sellers and eBay and only is benefiting people willing to misuse the return policy. I hope I just misunderstood him or he explained it poorly.

Ebay,Is this allowed on eBay? Was I scammed out of the figuarts Batman emp gun and accessories in the batpod set?,"Over the last few days, I’ve been negotiating a price over the sh figuarts batpod on eBay. The messages are linked below. 

The batpod is the main reason I’m buying the product, but the cool emp gun that’s included is just as important to me when I paid for the item. At $80, I thought the price was a little low, so I asked if it had ALL the accessories, and he said yes, leaving out the fact that he sold the Batman gun and hands to someone else.

Ebay,"Item damaged in transit, returned to the seller by courier before delivery","Having a troublesome engagement with a recent purchase, I bought a box of picture frames from a seller-


-It was tracked, and was delivered on a day where I was out, meaning it would be redelivered the next working day


-It was transferred to the courier depot and then returned directly to the seller through them due to an ambiguous 'problem' a few days later


-They then told me over the phone that I'd need to contact the seller for redelivery 


-I did, and got a hostile response stating that the frames had been smashed, he accused me of taking out the frames I wanted, then returning the item incomplete for a refund, and as you can imagine is refusing to reimburse me 


-I have proof through the online tracking updates that I never actually received the item myself, is the best course of action for me to just go to ebay directly with all of this information? 


-Another factor here is that my tracking number I received in a slip through the door is different to the tracking number on ebay, (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post the numbers so I'll leave them out for now). My tracking details end on the 26th, where the last update is:


'Your parcel has been returned to your sender. Please contact them with any queries''


But for the tracking number on ebay it keeps the same string of events as the tracking number on slip but restarts after the 26th until the 31st when the item was 'delivered', so I'm thinking that this 'delivery' is the item being returned to the sender; but it gets weirder.


When I called up the courier (Yodel) to ask about this tracking number on ebay, they said it was linked to another item not even in my postcode, so either the seller gave the wrong one and is getting confused or changed it on purpose as leverage to get out of paying a refund for damage as on the surface it looks like I did receive the item. (even though the date of 'delivery' has to be the day that seller received the item back from the courier.)

Ebay,Is there ANYTHING I can do to avoid losing out to buyer who claims fraud?,"I'll try and keep it brief.

-I sold an item and posted it a few days ago.  I sent a few at the same time and today got notification from a few buyers that items had arrived.  So I expected this item has too...

-Buyer opens a 'unauthorised payment' case with paypal saying that his account was used without his authorisation and that he didn't order the item.  Funny enough though, whoever the unscrupulous buyer was never changed his name or address, so it's apparently a 'fraudulent' purchase but delivered to the user of the eBay/paypal account, as opposed to the 'hacker'... I never believe these tales.  To me, it seems likely the buyer received the item, doesn't like it that much, and therefore is claiming they didn't order it at all.

-So now I'm being asked to provide proof of delivery- I only offer 2nd class Royal Mail, no tracking, on my orders, therefore I don't have this.  My money is being held so I am not receiving payment for this item even though I've sent it and the buyer (I believe) has it.

-If the buyer wins this case, I am a) out of pocket for the money I have to refund. b) out of an item.  And the buyer... (or, if I'm being generous- whoever has ordered this item but to their address, and under their name...) has the item, for free.

This is so infuriating.

I know it's probably a no, but... is there ANYTHING you'd recommend I do?",7,4,2018-04-03,EBAY,0.048863258212804794,0.9193124771118164,0.03182424604892731

Ebay,Interested in some opinions.,"I just had a very weird experience with on Ebay. Basically, I placed a max bid of $12 on an auction, and for about 5 days I was the high bidder. Sunday night at 9:35 PM I receive an e-mail from Ebay informing me that I have been outbid. Well, that sucks, but whatever, I'll just look the next day at other listings. The following day I find a new listing for the same item for less than what I bid on the auction. It had a ""Buy it Now"" option, so I jumped on it as fast as I could. Purchase was completed at 11:53 AM, as confirmed by Ebay.

Everything was fine and dandy, or at least I thought. Later that day at 3:36 PM, I receive an e-mail from Ebay telling me that the high bidder of the previous auction has retracted their bid, making me on top again. Obviously this was an issue because I had bought from another seller. To make things worse, there was only four hours left in the auction; Ebay only let's you retract bids with more than 12 hours remaining, the seller has to approve anything less. Naturally, one can assume that the seller allowed the previous high bid to be nixed.

That brings me to the confusing part. I contacted the seller, explained the situation, and asked for my bid to be taken off. They refused, instead saying that if the auction ended and I was still on top they would cancel the sale. Auction closed, I ""won."" 24 hours after that exchange and the sale has not been cancelled.

Does this make sense to anyone? Why would the seller let the other person retract their bid but not me? I'm not the dummy who put in a bid for something they didn't want to pay for. Do you think it's too far to  start thinking about a shill bidding situation? There was another bid underneath mine, so it confuses me even more to think the seller would rather make nothing then to make the $8 the auction would've ended at. 


*edit*
With Ebay's assistance, my ""order"" was cancelled a couple hours after posting this. All's well that ends well, I guess.",12,9,2018-04-04,EBAY,0.10984207689762115,0.863345205783844,0.026812728494405746

I've looked into this and I know that buyers can request your info through eBay, but eBay is supposed to notify you about this. I've checked my email and ebay messages and haven't received anything from them.

I've tried searching through some of my old orders that I've placed as the buyer on eBay and the Paypal transactions for them. On ebay I looked on the order details page, the seller's store page, and the contact seller page, and couldn't find anything at all. This might be because all those orders have been fulfilled for awhile though. On the Paypal side, all I was able to find was the seller's email address and full name.

I also have a business Paypal account which is supposed to show the buyer your business name instead of your personal one according to Google, which would limit the searching this buyer could do on me (assuming they did, which I doubt) without my name, or address.

Ebay,Buyer returned a stack of different movies rather than the boxset I mailed them. What do I do?,"In mid-late February I sold a $80 trilogy boxset imported from Hong Kong to someone. Late March, close to 30 days after I shipped, they opened a return request saying the item is not authentic. I replied back with all sorts of links and information that it's real. I heard nothing. I sent a follow up a week later and still heard nothing. Several days later they then asked eBay to step in, who set up a return shipping label. It arrived today. I've felt wary because they NEVER replied to my messages with proof, but this takes the cake: rather than the trilogy box set of Blu Rays, I got a stack of 4 DVDs. (by the same company that put out the so called ""not authentic"" BD set)

I opened a report on them through as soon as I saw this. I also sent a message to them asking ""hey, did you accidentally send back the wrong item to me?"" though I'm guessing they will also ignore the message.

What more can I do? I called eBay and I guess my options are to issue the refund and then ask for an overruling or something like that, message the buyer, or just check back.

I'm out $80 if I can't get it ruled in my favor since it's clearly me being scammed.

**update:** I guess the ebay gods are on my side today! I reached out to them through Twitter like I often do with my questions. I was told the funds will be released to me within a day or two and that the buyer's account will be on an internal team's watch list. That's all it took.

Ebay,Buyer wants partial refund,"NEW UPDATE  This is going to sound kind of unbelievable, I know, but this buyer I've been dealing with has been such a pain that I finally googled him.  I found that he was indicted for scamming both ebay and his credit card company in 2014.  I have no idea if he was convicted (how would I find that out?) but apparently this was mail fraud and I know that's bad.  I called ebay tonight and reported this, but they didn't seem horribly concerned.  I am very freaked out right now.  I don't know quite where to turn.


UPDATE if you're still following this saga, buyer refused my offer of a full refund.  I told him to return them and I would refund fully upon receipt, and would refund his shipping cost too. He says he will not pay the shipping cost to return the item even if I refund him that. He wants me to paypal him money ahead of time to pay for his return shipping.  This seems wrong to me and I don't want to do it. Should i?

I sold an item to a buyer who snapped it up on a ""buy it now"". Buyer is now claiming the item is not worth what he thought it was (obviously he wanted to sell it for a big profit) and wants a ""partial refund"" although doesn't state what that would be.  I offered to refund him in full if he returned the item but he would have to pay return shipping since i did not misrepresent the item in my listing.  He is refusing that and says he's going to stop payment and do all kinds of nasty things to my ebay and paypal accounts.  Not sure how to proceed ...and from what I'm hearing ebay is not particularly helpful.  What should I do?",26,9,2018-04-07,EBAY,0.061752479523420334,0.9022351503372192,0.036012355238199234
Ebay,"I bought a Phone on eBay nearly 6 months ago, but","I bought a ""LG V20 - 64GB- H918 T-MOBILE"" from a bad seller.

The phone was described as new and was ready for activation on the T-mobile network and other GSM carriers.
When I recieved the phone it was definately not new. It has a small but deep scratch on the screen that he tried to hide by preinstalling a screen protector. I decided to let him know and that I was just going to let it slide this time since i really needed a phone at the time. That isnt the real problem.

Last month the phone stopped working with AT&amp;T because the phone became black listed (bad IMEI).  So I opened a paypal case. The seller asked me to close the case if he fixes the problem.
He ""fixed"" the problem and it was now working with AT&amp;T again. So i asked paypal to close the case.

But now I switched to T-Mobile and the phone will not work. 
I visited a T-Mobile store and they told me the phone has an outstanding balance and cannot be used until the debt is paid off.

He sold me an item that does not match the description!

Is it too late to get my money back?

When I opened the case on paypal, I told paypal that he sold me a broken phone. 
The seller then told me that he was going to file a police report on me because he has proof that the phone was working and I have been using it for months. BUT ALL THIS TIME THE PHONE HAD AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE. That was not in the description!

Ebay,Partial refund on return,"I'm a little confused... I recently bought an item which had a major defect (phone with a broken microphone, damaged screen and cracks that weren't described). I requested a refund and the seller replied by offering a partial refund through return system and ebay is asking me if I accept or decline, but it doesn't actually say anywhere on any of these pages if I must return the item or not... 

My guess is that the seller decided it isn't worth paying the shipping twice and the trouble of selling a partially defective phone, and as it is worth more than the difference he offered even in its current condition I would be happy to accept that.

But is that the case?

Ebay,"New return policy where buyers are unconditionally correct, even if they admit they are wrong.","It is well known by frequent sellers that eBay sides with buyers vast majority of times when it comes to returns.

Ebay,Ebay authorized a return request 4 weeks after it was filed...,"Hey all,

The story is I sold a brand new, unopened video card on eBay at the height of the crypto craze. Someone bought it, I shipped it, I got my money. Everything seemed okay. I also specified no returns in the listing. Then a month later (30 days from when the package was delivered, 28 days from when the transaction was officially completed per eBay), claiming the card was defective.

So already I'm thinking this guy paid a high premium for a  video card, then after the market crashed he had buyer's remorse. Or he was a crypto miner who either blew up the card overclocking it or maybe he got unlucky with the silicon lottery. I respond to him that the item was brand new and unopened. If he opened it and it turned out to be defective for whatever reason, he would have to go through the manufacturer's warranty. Most retailers have a similar policy.

Nothing happens for 4 weeks until I buy something for $50 on eBay. Noticing I got charged $450 by PayPal, I realized that they put a hold on that transaction the buyer filed a return request for. So I go to the case and ask eBay to resolve it, saying that the buyer has not responded in 4 weeks. Two days later I find that they're authorizing the return request!

So to recap, buyer files a return request 28/30 days after delivery, then goes quiet for 4 weeks. It's been close to 2 months since the transaction was completed, yet he's still able to return it? Does a return request stay open indefinitely or something? I know for Newegg an RMA is only good for 14 days before you have to open another one, for example.

I called customer service, but they were of no help, only saying that the buyer has 30 days to file a return request. Has anyone experienced something similar? Were you able to resolve it in your favor?",8,5,2018-04-10,EBAY,0.08120173215866089,0.8805408477783203,0.03825743868947029
Ebay,Received defective product. Seller telling me to deal with manufacturer...,"I bought a manufacturer refurbished laptop from a US seller (Im in Canada). Laptop is defective (screen flickers and turns black/white sometimes).

So after learning this buyer is most likely trying to take advantage of me, I filed a police report for the missing stylus and submitted it to eBay.

Come to find out, eBay refunded them around $150 (for a purchase that was over $999) and they put in a claim with Paypal. The first time I called paypal, they gave me a link to upload my police report and eBay case result. I called again a few days ago and they said that they needed to have some sort of committee meet in order to determine who is in the right and who is not.

Ebay,MC011 on my account. Get a different answer every time I call eBay. What can I do to get this resolved?,"So I got an MC011 message on Saturday. Temp selling restriction until I send in documents. I send them in and now have a permanent selling restriction with no appeal chance. At least some support people say that. Others say I can appeal....Not sure what to believe at this point. I've called maybe 4 times now from Saturday till now. I've now been told I will hear back in 5-10 days....

So I've been told my items are not allowed on eBay.(Not True) Then I've been told I was selling outside of eBay.(Not True, I sometimes sent links to people who needed more info) I'm now being told I had too many returns / bad buyer experiences.

None of this makes any sense because I can't get a straight answer, I do my best as a seller and my account is rate above standard. Perfect feedback on both my accounts. One was created in I think 2002 the other in 2017. I have had about 4% return rate but always handled it in a proper professional manner. My account says good standing and Transaction defect rate is 0. Do they have hidden numbers I can't see? I would usually tell people to say an item was not as described if they wanted to return for any small defect or whatever, I guess that was a big mistake? I didn't think anything of it...

Does anyone have any advice other than to keep calling?

Also, I uploaded all my documents such as 2 IDs, Address, and receipts for items I sell.

I've always heard about eBay bullshit and how once you get flagged you are screwed but never thought I would have an issue.

I don't drop ship or anything like that.

All I can say is thank god I got a decent day job and eBay was a side gig for me. It still hurts though, makes me feel sad and angry both.  I really loved answering messages and hearing the app make that cash sound!

Ebay,How can sellers scam you out of money?,"I was looking for a new GPU and found one with a buy it now-option for 150€, normally these went for a little bit over 220€ at lowest, so it seemed a little bit fishy, but I took the bait. I googled the description text and found another listing on German eBay from a couple of days ago. It was listed for 275€ with exact same pictures as this 150€ one. I learned that I will never buy anything unless I reverse image search the pictures and google out the description text to find duplicates.

Anyways, I asked for a timestamped image with a custom word written on paper and obviously, I got some avoiding answers, such as ""It is in original package, cant do, please pay quickly"" even though the item description pictures showed GPU outside the package. 

My original plan was to report this seller to eBay if he doesn't send me the timestamped image/cancels the order/or whatever so he won't be able to scam anybody else. But it seems like eBay was quicker than me and a day later on his account it was written in red: ""No longer a registered user"". I got an e-mailed from eBay telling me that the order was cancelled and I assume the scammer was banned.

But I was wondering, how do these sellers scam people out of their money? Especially with such good money back guarantee from eBay? Do they make some kind of fake PayPal accounts and then cash out as soon as possible, so charge back becomes impossible? Is it even possible before the buyer has received the goods/is there some kind of holding account for money before seller can claim the money?

I came to write this, as GPU section is now being flooded with 250€+ worth GPUs for only 70-90€ with buy it now option and free international shipping. All different accounts, but description text and stock images are the same. They were also posted in the same time frame. Some have 0 feedback score, some a little bit more. One had over 50, but 99% of them were from over 12 months ago. I figured at least some of these accounts were hacked and now used for scamming people.

How do these sellers get money for this? If I paid for an item, waited for a while and then claimed no goods received, would I get my money back? In what scenario I would not? When the seller's account has nothing to reimburse with? Is there some other ways sellers can scam the buyers which I should be careful about?

Also, I couldn't find report seller button anywhere, if there even is one. How do I report these scam sellers to eBay?",33,12,2018-04-11,EBAY,0.07230137288570404,0.8975682258605957,0.03013037145137787

Ebay,Could I get some feedback on a listing?,"Hi everyone,

I am a new seller on eBay and have listed a pair of sneakers. I was wondering if I could get some of your feedback, if you are also a seller, on how my listing could be improved. I feel like I have set a fair price (much lower than what I bought it for) after looking at similar listings, and have provided plenty of pictures.

I am asking because the few items that I have sold so far, they have either been bid on/bought pretty quickly. This listing is still just kind of sitting, though. I see that links to eBay are prohibited here, so I'll just show you two screenshots:

Ebay,Update and More Questions on Hand Delivered Ebay Item with Recieved Payment,"I sold a pair of Supreme Shoes on Ebay and found that the buyer lives 15 minutes from me.

Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/8acuu9/hand_delivered_item_to_buyer_at_his_workplace/

&gt;I sold a $210 item and realized the buyer was in my city, I dont offer local pickup but I thought it was pointless to ship when he lives 15 minutes away from me. I accidentally printed the $12 or so shipping label and then voided it but Ebay showed the tracking as printed and “shipped” I dropped the package off at the address that is the buyers workplace. I gave it to what looked like a coworker. The buyer messaged me throughout this and okay’d everything before. Now he is asking when his package will come, any ideas? Did I just lose $200? Thanks


&gt;edit: I wrote that wrong, I know he was a coworker, he was working in the back part of the store. I didn’t call out the buyers name which was another big mistake on top of hand delivering it




**Now updated to right now**

I checked my paypal and saw that the payment was received. The money is not pending at all. I have $214 even though the package is marked as pre-shipment. The buyer hasn’t complained or responded to any messages. The buyer did not file a report at all. 


Link to album of what I see on my PayPal: https://imgur.com/a/3jXET


Even weirder is that the Ebay account username has Harris in it and the PayPal name is Harris. The address I delivered to and is “confirmed” on PayPal is an address of a popular clothing shop and I googled the name and he is the owner. The shipping address name is Jay, not Harris. I also googled Harris ____ (Last Name) and found that he worked at the shop.

I probably should not spend or transfer the $214 to my bank account, correct? I do not know if the buyer will file a report if they have not already. If he does not file one, will Ebay file one automatically or take the money away if the package is never marked as delivered?

They go instant bratty ape sh*t in message and ask for a return. Act like its your fault and you're an awfull person. You are calm and reasonable to them. Inform that they bought wrong item and I will more than happily take a return. They procede to tell you ""why should they? How is it my?"" And so on. They finally accept and agree to a return.

2 weeks later you get a busted broken thing back that looks like it was hurt on purpose and packaged like sht.

Ebay acts like. ""Yeah, happens sometimes bro...""",36,24,2018-04-13,EBAY,0.09265153110027313,0.8672449588775635,0.0401034839451313
Ebay,"Had a return from a buyer through eBay, I refunded him and he claims he never got it. Left negative.","So like the title says, someone returned an item to me. It was all fine, but suddenly more than 2 or 3 months later, they reached out to me saying they still haven't been refunded. I checked my paypal account and it was debited from my account and the eBay return process showed closed: ""This amount has been debited from your PayPal account. The buyer's request is now closed. Thanks for working things out with the buyer.""

I messaged him back with this information including screenshots to that show the case was closed and he was refunded, and asked him to double check and if it still hasn't shown up to call eBay. He responded with anger and said it wasn't his job to call eBay and that I was stealing his money. 

I tried to respond nicely with him to explain that he needs to call eBay not talk to me. Finally I gave up and he's continued to harass me (over $15 nonetheless) and even left me a negative...

Ebay,Condition listed wrong?,"Hey all!

So I made a new listing about 2 1/2 days ago with 3 games as an auction, when I made the listing the condition it asked for was only either “new” or “used”. Obviously I hit used, there weren’t any other options. Now I just noticed with some bids on my lot now, that the condition is listed as “like new”, however in my description for the lot I have it clearly listed that the games are in rough shape and “as-is”. 

It won’t let me change the condition of the items, assuming it’s because there’s already bids on it. Should I be fine if I have it listed with the description detailing it’s not in good shape?",9,5,2018-04-13,EBAY,0.046564918011426926,0.9072090983390808,0.04622595012187958

Ebay,Am I being dragged along?,"I ordered a pair of shoes on eBay, from a seller with 30 feedback and one negative feedback for immediately canceling an order. I emailed the seller and accepted the offer made to me when asking them what they were hoping to get for the item. I paid and accepted the offer on April 6th a week ago today. The seller told me they would ship on Tuesday April 10th, and then again on Thursday April 12th, both times after I had emailed them asking for shipping details. I have emailed them again today Friday April 13th and they replied with, “I’ll ship them today sorry”. Every time I email the seller they reply, I am just confused about what’s going on. I understand things come up in life but I feel like I’m being dragged along, and I don’t understand why they would do this.

Please, let me know what I should do. Time is not the issue but I am starting to wonder if they ever will send my item.

Ebay,"Sold an item on ebay, I think I am being scammed","Sold an item on ebay, listing details / photos were correct but looks like I accidentally listed the wrong model number. Model number I looked up was apparently for the 2017 model, I was selling the 2016 model. Buyer requested to return the item based on this upon receiving it. I agreed to allow return.

He shipped the item back, however that's when the problem began. The tracking number says it was delivered and has my address but I never received the item. I called the post office and they said the scanning label on the package had a different address, a local business franchise address. It was delivered to them. They said they can't help any further and to work with the sender.

So looks like I am not getting the item back. The USPS tracking number still says the item was delivered, so ebay is pushing me to refund the money. The buyer doesn't respond to my messages.

Anything I can do or am I out the item/money?

Ebay,pay pal going to No Time Limit on Refunds?,"I dont know what to make of this story. My friend is a long time ebay seller. he does lots of volume in lower priced items but he seems to be doing prettywell. He's one of these guys who knows enuf to be dangerous. he's always giving people advice, half which is bad advice. 

so anyhow he tells me he got a message from paypal about a transaction he did 8 months ago. Paypal wants proof that he sent the item. He says"" wait a minute. Isnt there a six month time limit on returns?"" they say there's no time limit and we'll refund the guys money if you cant prove you sent the item.

he digs around for an hour and finally does fnid the proof. He had signature confirmation. it was a $175 order for laces (for ice skates, who knew?)  the guy did sign for it. 

Pay pal said ""thanks.  you're off the hook.""

my question is: is this a real thing? Are they really going back beyond six months now? like I said my friend is fairly intelligent, he doesnt get everything right, but he's not an idiot.

Ebay,Annoying thing about eBay promotions,"Okay, this is what I don't understand. eBay gives you a set number for free listings at the beginning of every month. Then shortly after that you get promotional listings that expire in 3 days to a week's time. When you start hitting up the free listings, what does eBay do? They take away from your monthly freebies first that have a longer expiration date. This doesn't make sense to me at all. I don't always have time to use up the promotional listings, so by the time I get to them they are expired because I had to use up my monthly listings first. This seems backwards to me.

Ebay,Do you report buyers cancelling and asking for bid retractions?,"This month I've had a rash of buyers purchasing then asking to cancel, making bids and asking to cancel their bids, and people just flat out not paying.

The reason that they give me, universally, is that the price is too high and they're too broke.

Ten minutes later he contacted me on another site, without knowing it was me, and tried to buy the same thing there!

Another one cancelled his bid today - demanded a bunch of new photos, documents of authenticity, emails, everything. I sent it all to him then boom - ""I can't buy this, I don't have enough money, please cancel."" After I accepted his bid hours before.

Ebay,How to go further with not receiving my item?,"Long story short: I did not receive my item with USPS. Tracking shows delivered. Seller opened a case with USPS and it got denied. 

Throughout this process I was open with the seller and contacted the post office 3 separate times. My landlord of the apartment complex has a video showing the exact time my package was said to be “delivered”. At that time, the mail carrier had just pulled up. It wasn’t until 5 minutes later than the “delivered” time that the carrier began putting mail in the mailbox. I live in an apartment and the boxes are pretty small. Although it shows “delivered in/at mailbox”, I don’t think it would have actually fit (in fact I’ve had packages left on my doorstop that said “delivered in/at mailbox”). 

I called my local PO, they pulled up the geotracking and said the package was delivered, however it was scanned outside of the complex. So the package was scanned as delivered not at my mailbox (or door) but outside the complex. Furthermore, the usual carrier was out so it was a substitute. 

USPS denied the insurance claim (tracking shows delivered) and eBay denied the refund automatically due to tracking (which I suppose I can understand since this is a USPS issue). I’m trying to be reasonable but now I’m frustrated because my package literally never arrived. I’ve asked my neighbors, landlord, videos around the complex (no cameras by my door though). I’m frustrated because I genuinely did not receive the package and I don’t think that I can do much more since I didn’t ship the item. Tracking is useless if it’s scanned as delivered inside the truck.",18,3,2018-04-17,EBAY,0.08125000447034836,0.8914549350738525,0.027295002713799477

2.) I refreshed a few of the searches.

3.) I contacted customer service and the next day I got a bunch of emails, and then they stopped again.

Ebay,Feedback Etiquette Question,"Hey r/eBay, I'm fairly new to eBay and have a question on how to handle feedback for a specific situation.

I bought an item last week, paid that day and the seller shipped the next. The only shipping option was free, but it listed that it was Expedited USPS Priority Mail. eBay gave an estimate of 1-3 business days for delivery, yesterday being the final day. I assumed the seller just added in the shipping cost to the final cost of the item to attract more people to the free shipping.

The problem is they shipped FedEx Smartpost and their estimated delivery is next Monday. I've been watching the tracking and it's still on the way, just moving ridiculously slow. We've already gone over eBay's estimated delivery range.

I guess I technically didn't pay for expedited shipping, only free shipping. And if the item comes as described I'll be pretty happy. But I'm a little frustrated right now that they shipped it with Smartpost of all things when I was expecting expedited from their listing. What's the etiquette for something like this?

Edit: I didn't realize this was such a touchy topic. Sorry. If I wasn't clear, free shipping, USPS Priority was the *only* option I was given. [Here's what my invoice says](https://i.imgur.com/vNim9Ec.png), [here's the tracking](https://imgur.com/d3BfysT). I've never had a good experience with Smartpost, so I was frustrated. I wanted to know if it was something I should take into consideration for feedback since it was free shipping. I've gotten conflicting opinions, I'll take it all into account and wait until I actually get the item before deciding.

Ebay,Calculated Shipping for UPS / FedEx on Ebay.CA,"In the USA,  Ebay.Com users can use the invaluable caluclated shipping option with couriers like UPS, FedEx, etc.  

These services are arguably faster, more reliable, and they cost pennies compared to Government postal services.

In Canada,  we have the same services.  We have UPS, FedEx.  etc.  However unlike our neighbors, Canadian Ebay sellers can NOT take advantage of Calculated shipping for any courier other than Canada Post.

Canada Post is notoriously unreliable,  slow,  expensive, and outright dishonest.  And for years our shop and thousands of other sellers in Canada.  Have been forced to either use the Garbage Post,  (and then recieve negative feedback and complaints when CPC ****s it up),  or go with flat-rate shipping on our listings.  

This is a problem because Joe Thumb in Boston, pays the same shipping as John Doe in San Jose.   And John Doe probably won't even buy the item.

Worse yet,  flat rate you have -1- choice.   you can put whatever amount you want in there, and whatever carrier,  but that number applies to All areas within the countries you choose to make it for. 

So if you have an item on flat rate for 50 to USA.  you're losing money if you have to ship it to Texas or Alaska or something, 

This is utterly ridiculous that we must go through with this when the US sites have full calculated shipping that gives every buyer a specialized, focused price on a case by case basis within a few dollars.  

I've complained about this before,  and normally the response is ""Oh it's just not worth it to the companies"" to which I say that argument is complete and utter garbage.  Canada is a G7 Country little different than that of the US, UK, France, etc.

Ebay,What to do when a buyer requests what I suspect is a fraudulent refund request?,"I'm not new to ebay, but this is the first time a buyer has requested a refund for (item not as described) INAD when it is clear it is buyer's remorse. He accuses me, the seller, of the item being fake when it clearly is not and therefore has initiated a return request.

I have so far, not accepted the return (I don't accept returns) just messaged him back and forth telling him he's wrong in his accusation, but according to ebay's return policy he has to wait several days before progressing things further.

I suspect after that time period is up he will use the resolution process to ""force""? a return, whereby I guess a return shipping label is generated for him to send back the item (he's in the UK).

Since, he opened a INAD, as a seller I seemingly cannot decline his request for a refund (there is no option in the seller resolution dashboard).

For those who have experienced such buyer's remorse farces, what are my options right now? Does contacting ebay customer service do anything for the seller? Or does one have to wait until he ships the item and I receive it back (in what condition), before I can appeal to ebay to dispute the Paypal refund? Can I ask ebay to ""step in"" before that point, such as after the few days have past, but before he ships the item back?

If I proactively accept the return (before he initiates one on his own), how does that impact my later request to appeal for a resolution in my favor? Do I wave my ability to get back my shipping fees or item cost because I accepted the return without protest?

If ebay finds in my (the seller) favor, what happens to the refund amount? Do I end up with the item plus the sold price (ex: shoes + $75). Does the buyer keep the refunded amount? What happens with any negative marks placed on my account b/c of this dispute?

Ebay,"Ebay giving my buyers completely incorrect/unrealistic delivery expectation date, cannot fix problem.","Hi guys, just wanted to give a heads up or see if anyone else is dealing with this issue. I had an item with three day handling, set to ship on April 18th (according to seller hub), I shipped it on that day and got an INR opened on the 20th by a buyer who said it was supposed to arrive by the 19th. Another buyer emailed me, TWO DAYS after purchasing an item with two day handling time to ask why it didn't arrive yet, since apparently ebay told her it would arrive the day after purchase (wtf?). 

All the listings have two or three day handling with first class mail. I got passed around between four CSRs when I called, two told me that there was a glitch, I shipped on time, and the actual date that my buyers should have been able to open a case was April 27th. #3 was weirdly catty, told me that I shipped the item ""ummmm, like, super late"" and insisted that Saturday and Sunday are business days, and that I was supposed to ship by the 16th. Seller hub most definitely said the 18th, which was three business days after the buyer bought it. Fourth CSR said that when they tried to view my listing and handling time they ""couldn't see"" that part of the listing (it was just missing off the page), but confirmed that Saturday and Sunday are not business days and the correct date to ship was the 18th.

 I confirmed that all of my listings have two or three day handling and changed one to four, to see what would happen, it is not affecting the ""expected delivery"" date. I even ended a listing and used sell similar to relist, AND made an entirely new listing from scratch and both have incorrect delivery estimates. Nobody at ebay could help me and put in a ""tech report"" so ""ebay can fix it""

My listings are all still telling buyers they will have the item in hand Tuesday or Wednesday, when I am not even supposed to ship the items until Tuesday or Wednesday.  

The only suggestion a CSR gave about how to ""fix"" this is to message all my buyers and let them know the listing was incorrect so their item will be late (so they can blame me I guess?) and just upload tracking when people open a case so it can be closed in my favor. These are both unacceptable to me and in no way protect me from the fallout of this weird glitch.

Ebay,"Dear eBay, please acknowledge that Singapore exists! (Shipping label error)","TL;DR: Can't print discounted international USPS labels through eBay with the destination of Singapore, gives a ""Please enter a valid value for destination city."" error each time, no fix known at the moment.

Alright, the title might be a bit over-dramatic, I'm sure the people at eBay know that Singapore, in fact, exists. But this problem is still pretty frustrating!

A buyer purchased an item today, and i have USPS First Class Mail International set as my international shipping option. Buyer paid and after i clicked ""Pay for shipping and print label"" I received the following error message:

""We're having trouble printing your label. Please enter a valid value for destination city.""

So i tried editing the recipients shipping info, and you can edit their zip code, phone number, name, and address, however there is no box visible to type in their city when the destination country is Singapore.

I tried a few more times and gave up. I called eBay. The girl on the phone was nice, but she was also unable to find a solution. She called someone ""higher up,"" but after putting me on hold for 10 minutes, they too were also unable to find a solution.

So she credited me with the discount i would have received had i shipped the item with eBay's USPS discount, and advised me that i print the label from the USPS store or website itself, bypassing eBay altogether. ...so uh, they kinda gave up.

Here is what i THINK is happening: Singapore is both a city AND a country, like the Vatican or Monaco, and someone on eBay's shipping label programming team did not set up this destination correctly. It blocks you from selecting a city completely when the destination is the country of Singapore, but also won't let you print the label without selecting a city, ...which you can't do. So the shipping program does not realize that the city of Singapore actually exists.

I really, really don't want to block shipping to Singapore on my listings, but this is quite a headache. It's also unclear if the package will now be protected by eBay if it's lost. (Since the label was technically printed without eBay's involvement, i'm going to assume no.)

Ebay,Do eBay do anything if you report an item if you believe it’s a fake?,"I’ve been watching a Kate Spade watch on eBay for the last few weeks. The seller has been putting this specific watch up, it sells and then they put the same watch up again and the process continues. It’s relatively cheap and I just figured that they must have got a bunch of stock on sale/wholesale and was then on-selling for profit. I don’t have an issue with that.

Now the feedback the seller has been getting for these watches is positive. I should say that they also come with a box and authenticity card. Today I was looking on bidding on one of these watches but as I scrolled through the photos, I noticed the eyes on the dog on this watch are noticeably different to those on the photos of the watch on the official website. I’ve also checked other eBay listings and the eyes are like the ones on the official site. The more I look, the more I realise that these watches must be fakes. Although, they look well done - if I hadn’t of picked up the difference with the eyes - it’s difficult to tell otherwise.

Ebay,"[Help] Sold my first listing on ebay, the was package intercepted by the buyer and now buyer claims they didn’t receive it and wants a refund.","I sold an item of $200 two weeks ago. I had my doubts as I have heard about scams but the buyer had over 30k ratings and few negative so I assumed it was not. I shipped my packaged on 04/03/18 to the provided address (IN 46815) and used flat rate first class mail. It was supposed to be delivered within 3 days but then the tracking changed to intercepted and showed going to a new location. Contacted buyer asking if they did, they said that they were actually selling it to somebody else (so they were acting like a middleman). They said it looked fishy but we would be protected (my mistake of believing it). It was delivered on 04/07/18 to an agent to a different zip code (NJ 07726). Now the buyer filed a claim yesterday on paypal saying they didn’t receive the item. I called ebay and paypal and was told that I needed to provide proof that the buyer intercepted it. I googled about it and saw that usps doesn’t really provide information about it and didn’t see it getting solved anywhere. I couldn’t contact them today as they are closed and will be going tomorrow. Besides that could someone give my any suggestions on what I could do?

[Update 1] - New information from my buyer. Their buyer filed a chargeback for unauthorized transaction. So they are filing (to me) an item not received claim since “paypal wants them to” as item was supposed to be delivered to the transaction address.

I went to the USPS and they were of no help, asked me to call the 1-800 number. I can’t reach a person no matter what option I choose. Called ebay and now they say since its a paypal claim they can’t do anything about it. Called paypal and told them how its my fault that the third person was a fraud. They said that I still need verification, told them I had no way of getting it. Was told to email them the shipping receipt and messages between me and buyer and they’ll decide on the outcome. Also they said if I don’t agree with the decision I could appeal.

[Update 2] Waiting on Paypal’s decision, uploaded receipt and messages. Finally got a hold of USPS customer representative and they filed a case, said will take 2-3 days so waiting on that too.

[Update 3] Called Paypal after 2 days since they still haven’t made a decision, was told that its still under review and in the last process and could take another 2 days. USPS supervisor from IN called yesterday and said that they had no way getting the information on who intercepted it. I asked if there was a certain department who could look it up and was told NO (so nobody looks after the USPS website and also whats the use of postal inspectors??). So last hope is I get a positive response from Paypal but I don’t have high hopes on that.

[Update 4] Paypal made the decision and the buyer won the case. Called back to appeal and the representative ASSURED and gave me her word that I would win the case since I uploaded the shipping receipt. Got an email today saying that the appeal was denied.

Ebay,"Negative feedback threat, Should I report it?","I've been using eBay for over a decade and have sold things intermittently. Last week, a buyer purchased and paid for multiple items that I listed only to send me a bunch of messages, hours later, that simply said ""I WANT TO CANCEL THIS ORDER"". I messaged them back, asking for clarification on what they wanted cancelled because I only saw requests on 3 of the 10 things they ordered from me. They told me to cancel the three, I did so, and then shipped the other 7.

Hours later, the buyer emails me that they want everything cancelled. I say that I asked them for clarification before about which items they wanted cancelled. They responded that they were sorry because they misread and agreed that they would ship the items back to me once it arrived for a refund.

Fast forward to this week: the buyer opens a return request for only ONE of the items listed with the reason being ""ordered by mistake"". Ok, I approve the return. They ask me to send them my address and ""how much it would cost for them to send it back"". I give my address and tell them to go to the post office for further assistance with shipping it back. The next morning they open 6 return requests 3 as ""Item not as described"" and 3 as ""Wrong item sent"" and demand that I send shipping labels for all of the items (each item weighs less than 1oz, BTW.)

Then, I looked at the seller's other listings and he had the same guitar listed two more times, with different selling locations in Germany and France, and different currencies.

I watched the bids, and the next day the bidding was removed, and a new bidding was put up for the same guitar at around the same price. This time I looked more closely at the item description and saw that they say the item is only available for ""Fast Sale"" and any bid above 1500 dollars, or whatever other equivalent will be accepted, and the normal bids on the item will be removed.

It seems they remove the listing and re-create it once a day, and it confuses me. Wouldn't it be so much easier to just list it at a buy-it-now price? The only reason I could see them going through all this trouble is that they want a person to 'buy' the guitar at the price they ask, but have the listing stay up for a few more days, so that someone else who sees the listing might bid on it further, causing the price to go up. I'm pretty confused, and figured I'd ask you folks what you thought.",2,3,2018-04-24,EBAY,0.06497911363840103,0.9032164216041565,0.03180445358157158
Ebay,Looking for reserve price auctions advice,"I'm a long time eBay'er but have never done an auction with a reserve price.

Edit for more info: I've been selling guitars on eBay and Reverb for a local music store owner for over a year now. This guitar has been up as a buy it now with offers since September. I've had some lowball offers and sob stories but nothing close to the asking price. Another seller has had the same guitar listed for a higher price for just as long. There was one sale for this guitar in January for $6500 since it had some cosmetic faults.

Ebay,eBay Keeps Changing Shipping When Buying Postage?,"When I go to buy postage, eBay sometimes shows priority as being cheaper than parcel select ground, so of course I upgrade to priority. Then when I print the label it says ""Parcel Select Ground,"" and of course the receipt in my inbox shows I paid more money for the slower shipping with no insurance. 

I understand eBay doesn't want the seller to downgrade the shipping the buyer selected, but really eBay, you won't let me *upgrade* the shipping at no cost to the buyer? 

Has anyone else had this issue?

Ebay,Should I Start Selling Again?,"Hey all, 

Just looking for some community feedback. I used to sell things pretty frequently a few years back and never had any problems \- and the few questions or concerns I had could be resolved with a refund, as the items I sold were mostly just low dollar value items \(some apparel items, with the occasional big ticket electronic item\). Every few years, I have generally made it a point to purge my closet, electronics cabinets, etc., of all the old things I don't use anymore by selling them on eBay. This has never been a problem.

I'm getting to that point again where it's time to sell off some inventory, but from my own experiences as a buyer and from what I've been reading on this sub and elsewhere, I'm now really, really, really, really hesitant to try to put anything up for sale. Most of the items I need to get rid of now are electronics that are still perfectly good but that I just don't need anymore. The market rates for most of them exceed $300 \(at least, that's the Buy It Now rate that I'm seeing, on average\) but I'm very, very concerned I'm going to get scammed, and honestly, that kind of money would mean a lot to me right now \(I don't make a ton of money, and my bi\-annual purge has generally been a big help to my pocketbook\). I am obviously very familiar with eBay's policies and the selling process, but I really, really, really can't afford to get scammed out of some of the items that I would like to put up for sale. Procedurally, I've always just put a low price \(about 1/3 of the current trending auctions\) on the item and then set them up as week long auctions, and then shipped out. My questions: 

1\) What are some easy ways to deter scammers now? 

2\) I'm gathering sellers don't have a lot of recourse if they do get scammed; is this really the case? 

3\) Would anyone that might have had to make a similar choice or been in a similar situation recommend continuing to see items like this on eBay? I just hear so many horror stories now about it that I feel it would be a bad idea not to at least ask around",4,7,2018-04-25,EBAY,0.05141525715589523,0.9136331081390381,0.034951645880937576

Ebay,How to deal with this buyer/negative feedback?,"I have recently sold a gift, roku ultra, that was sealed in its original packaging including the shrink wrap.

I sold it to this buyer and shipped on the same day through UPS \(the UPS worker also packaged the product and I saw that it was very secured\). I took pictures of both the product packaging and the shipping box/content.

The buyer received the product today and messaged me thanking me for the fast shipping but said the device was ""shredded in 6 to 7 pieces."" He stated ""I want either a refund or compensation. You should not send me things that you destroyed. FAULTY LISTING!!!!!!!""

I have replied back apologizing this happened and attached the pictures that showed the packaging was in good shape.

I also told him I can take back the device for the full refund.

He replied: ""I just want compensation. I don't want to return this. I left a negative review so future buyers know that you are a scammer.""

It seems he opened a dispute case with both Ebay and PayPal as well because I received notifications saying there is an opened case.

Could someone suggest me a good resolution to this? Anything is truly appreciated.

EDIT: Thank you for all your responses. I have called and spoke to an Ebay representative as stated by a lot of you. The rep asked for pictures and UPS receipts for documentation. Then I was placed on hold for about 5 minutes and the Ebay representative ruled in buyer's favor since the rep stated that UPS damaged my package which is seller's responsibility. The representative said he refunded the buyer of the full cost and provided a prepaid label to send the product back and the cost of the label will be added to my seller statement.

Ebay,"New to selling on Ebay, buyer hasn't received item, how is this going to work out?","Hi - I'm new to Ebay, but have a lot of experience selling on Amazon. Recently on Ebay, I had a customer open a claim stating that they did not receive their item. The tracking states that the item was delivered (left at the door), so I think it's safe to assume that the item was either stolen or the customer is being dishonest and trying to get their money back.

Either way, when this happens on Amazon, I know that the short of it is I'm basically out of the item, and if I don't refund the customer, Amazon is going to do it for me, and that's going to ding my good standing with Amazon. So my standard course of action is to forward the customer the tracking #, ask them to confirm their shipping address, check around the property and with neighbors, and then get back to me. After that I just suck it up and offer the refund.

Ebay,"What should I be looking out for when making a transaction with someone internationally, but have a U.S. address?","I understand that it may be 100&amp;#37; legitimate, but looking it up, I can't help but think a lot of it is seller paranoia, since I can't really find many specific things to look out for to avoid getting scammed. A lot of posts say an international buyer with a U.S. address is safe, and they use a proxy address to make it easier for themselves. Others say that in itself is a huge red flag.

I figured I'd be excluding a wide customer base if I just outright refused to make those transactions, and I'm sure this has been asked before, but what are some red flags for a scam specifically for this type of situation?",2,4,2018-04-28,EBAY,0.02806132659316063,0.9278168082237244,0.044121865183115005

Ebay,Buyer's address is really weird and turns up unfound on Google?,"Without giving his personal info away I'll just say that the address almost looks like two addresses merged together.

I'm waiting to hear back from him but I only have 20 more minutes to get to the post office before it's closed today on a Saturday and I wanna get it out, but I am worried about address and he hasn't messaged back yet.

Has anyone ever had this before?

it has  

NZ1853153

listed twice in two different places of the address, at one point right before everything else and at another point after the street but before zip. Is this some sort of weird p.o. box? The other address listed is American.

The shipping label is forcing me to create it with this weird NZ1853153 thing and google directions says that won't work soo.

Ebay,Some advice please?,"In about late February I sold a phone that I no longer needed. I shipped it out immediately and I never really looked back at it until a couple weeks ago when the buyer messaged me stating he wants to return it because it didn’t work. It was working perfectly fine when I sent it but I told him to just send it back anyway for a refund. I didn’t get a response for a few days until he messaged me saying that he’s waiting for me to send a return label so that he can send it back. I told him to start a return using eBay and I don’t get a response again for about a week. Then a few days ago, he opened a case claiming that he never received the item. I checked the tracking and of course it was never marked as delivered when I needed it the most. It was marked as out for delivery but it’s stuck at “Package delayed” ever since March 2nd so I doubt it’ll ever say it was actually delivered. So my question is who will ebay side with?

Ebay,I just got offered a possible opportunity and i need advice,"Here's my situation. My bosses brother may offer me a commission based opportunity soon that could potentially be a lucrative situation for all three of us. My boss and his brother co-own a business together in a industry that I am familiar with and very passionate about. I might be handling online sales for him soon. The products are definitely in the high ticket category but they are also one that are very sought after. So when they do get listed for sale they sell quick. Just recently he started working together with one of the bigger names in the industry and they offered us there items at damn near there cost. Their giving him access to there entire inventory which is a impressive one at that. Not only that but when we sell something in there inventory they take over shipping it but brand it with our label. which is amazing for us because it's something that is easily destroyed if shipped improperly.

Anyway here is what I'm curious about.

1) what if any are the best sources of information online where I can learn the necessary processes for selling on eBay and hopefully avoiding as many new guy mistakes as possible. Also a factor is price, I'm not able to jump on any of these absurdly priced courses that are the first thing that pop up on Google when you try and search for something like this. If there's any free info that's complete that would be ideal.

2) during some of the searching I've done I have seen software advertised that links products from one site ( our wholesale partner) to sites like eBay and Amazon. One of which updates current inventory for said item in real time. Are there preferred versions or companies that outshine the others for something like this?

Any help is greatly appreciated.",5,4,2018-04-29,EBAY,0.021848298609256744,0.92415452003479,0.05399711802601814

Ebay,Advice needed.. big headache,"Bought a PS4 PRO from Ebay using Buy It Now for $300, free shipping and no tax I thought what a deal! this was on April 24th.

I went back and forth with Ebay and at this point didn't even want the item as I bought it locally with cash so I just wanted it to be done and over with, I also initiated a charge back as I later found out that I paid the seller directly and didn't use ebays pay portal? I had no idea of this until recently.  **I DID PAY THROUGH EBAY.COM WITH INTEGRATED_MCC**

$300 charge posted and I just left it alone at this point but today I recieved an 
email..

""Good news--your order was canceled.

You don't need to do anything else.""

And yet no refund and still no communication from the seller. it does state that he did indeed cancel it and I was under the impression I would receive a refund upon cancellation as he never shipped anything! Ebay said the same, and told me to wait until may 2nd if I don't receive anything to follow the money back guarantee. 

So should I even expect a refund following cancellation or am I going to have to have my bank RIP the money out of Ebays hands?",11,3,2018-04-29,EBAY,0.05063962563872337,0.9160649180412292,0.0332954004406929
