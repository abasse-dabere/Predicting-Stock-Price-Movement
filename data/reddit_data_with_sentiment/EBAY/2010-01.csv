Ebay,Should I make a big deal out of this?,"I had just purchased a numark IDJ2 mixer board from a fairly new seller. The item was supposed to come in the original box in mint condition with all the original parts. When it arrived it was repackaged in a plain brown UPS box and when I took the item out it was missing several parts (including the power supply) and was clearly not in mint condition. It was in GOOD condition, but not mint.

The seller claims that he dropped it off at UPS in all the original packaging and in mint condition. There were no indications that the item was repackaged by either UPS or customs canada however.

Something smells fishy about the whole thing, but the seller has agreed to replace the power supply with a universal power supply, without offering an explanation as to why it did not have the original power supply in the first place.

Does it sound like this is worth taking to paypal buyers protection since it differs so much from the original description?",9,3,2010-01-19,EBAY,0.038489796221256256,0.9189386963844299,0.042571499943733215
