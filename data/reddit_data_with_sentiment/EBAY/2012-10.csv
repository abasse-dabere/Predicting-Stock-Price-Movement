Ebay,"How long is ""approximately three days""?","After a very long break from ebay I've decided to start an ebay business, but I'm off to a bad start. After mentioning the competition in our listings I received an email from eBay:

Ebay,Some advice needed,"I'm quite new to using ebay, especially auctions. I won an auction on an item, sent payment through paypal; and this morning received this PM:

&gt;Dear [mal_irl],
&gt;
&gt;EBAY checked my account and this payment was made to old email address. Unfortunately, this email address unconfirmed on my PayPal account and so this payment went Unclaimed. This is the reason why you could not see it on your PayPal account. 
&gt;
&gt;EBAY request you cancel your unclaimed payment and send a new one directly on the PayPal site. You will still be covered by the buyer protection program. I can then send you a new invoice directly on the PayPal site as this will enable you to pay to my correct PayPal account.
&gt;
&gt;Below are the steps on how the buyer can cancel their payment: 
&gt;
&gt;1. Log in to your account at https://www.paypal.co.uk/, and click the ""History"" sub tab.
&gt;
&gt;2. Select 'Payments Sent' from the drop down menu.
&gt;
&gt;3. Select the dates by manipulating the date box and click ""Search"".
&gt;
&gt;4. Click ""Cancel"" in the Action column of the unclaimed amount.
&gt;
&gt;- [seller's username]

The transaction was indeed unclaimed in paypal, and I did cancel it after I received this message. I told the seller I had done so and he got back to me with the following emails:

&gt;Dear [mal_irl],
&gt;
&gt;Hi, there is a manual invoice in your pay pal account for payment to me please. Kind Regards
&gt;
&gt;- [seller's username]

Then a moment later:

&gt;Dear [mal_irl],
&gt;
&gt;Sorry but further to my last email, I need your email address used for log in to paypal, so the invoice can go direct to you please. Hope thats OK and apologies again.
&gt;
&gt;- [seller's username]

The seller has 100% positive feedback, over 500 ratings. I'm just a little sceptical of the non-conventional route taken here. No money or additional information (incl. my email) has changed hands at the moment.

Ebay,Seller misrepresented car in ad- here's what I've tried.  Anything else?,"Long time lurker, first time post - hope you guys can help me out.
I bougth a car from a Texas seller that had a 100% rating.  I'm in Missouri.  Car has some issues, but it was used, and I understand these things come with purchasing a preowned vehicle.  The car was advertised with Bose stereo and heated seats; it has neither.  It also only had one key - the seller verbally told me it had 2, and the windshield is cracked so that it won't pass state inspection.  
I itemized the value of the repairs/replacements and asked the seller to reimburse me.  I can share the list if you like, but it was ~$1000.  The seller offered me $500.  
Should I be lucky to get anything from this seller?  Should I fight for more?  I really like the car and don't want the hassle of sending it back, but I'm nearing a pissed off level of just returning it and demanding my money back.  
tl;dr eBay seller lied about car features and conditions - should I take the settlement?

Edit:
I really appreciate the comments and insight from everyone.

The seller told me he used carad.com - a service that provides car info based on VIN but eBay now owns that service. I'm going to write eBay an email telling them their service is shitty and flawed.

For better or worse, the seller and I settled on $700. It's not enough, IMO, but I have a life/family and dealing with arbitration or sending it back would be time away from it.

Ebay,[Question] I think someone is trying to scam me. How common is this sort of thing?,"Hello /r/Ebay . I'm an experienced buyer on eBay, but I am trying to sell only my second item, and the experience has been nothing short of a goddamn nightmare. 

I decieded to put my old iPhone 3GS up for sale. It's battered and half broken, but it does still work, and all it's multitude faults are clearly indidcated in the listing. First, I had someone buy it, then not contact me at all. I ended up waiting the four days, then lodging an Unpaid Item, then waited another 4 days for some sort of response. Nothing at all. I got my final value fee credit.

Okay, so I then relisted. Under my post conditions, I had listed ""posts to Australia only"", but had not specified any further conditions in the listing. Someone bought it, and paid, but was from Indonesia. Now, Australia Post does not allow Li-Ion batteries to be sent through the post, so I had to enquire about a courier, which turned out to be 90 bucks, which she baulked at. Why not ask that question **before** checkout? I refunded her and relisted, knocking 10 off my asking price. 

Now someone else has bought it, someone with 0 feedback. Nearly 24 hours since it was bought, there has been no payment and no message to say when I can expect payment. But, here's where the plot thickens. I got woken up by a message this morning by another user: 

&gt;I will give you $80 posted to my door

I know that asking someone to sell ""off ebay"" is against ebay T&amp;C. My reply: 

&gt;This sort of offer is not allowed under eBay terms and conditions. Please do not contact me again.

His reply to this: 

&gt;No I meant you could relist this as a new item at the agreed price ? Sorry I was just asking

This was someone sending me a message on a *completed* item. Now, how does he have any clue that I still have the phone? For all he knows, I have sent it to the buyer already. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I was just wondering if this sort of thing is common. It smells suspiciously like a scam: use a new account to buy, don't pay, then swoop in to save the day with a lower offer to try and take advantage of a frustrated seller.

Ebay,What are the rules regarding negative feedback?,"So I've had a small problem with a buyer who purchased some disposable razors from me. These razors are made and packaged by Wilkinson (Single blade with a plastic arm sealed in packs of 10), He purchased 50 of these razors (5 packs of 10) for £6.00 + Postage which was all well and fine.

I then recieved the following message,

""Razors do not work couldn't get a good shave so binned the lot, was a shame as thought they were very good value! Please refund the money and I will remove negative feedback. Thank you""

I know these arms are really crappy in that they are very cheap and low quality, exactly as Wilkinson made them, as I have used them myself. They get the job done but nowhere near as smoothly as any decent expensive razor will.

Do I have any obligation to accept this refund? I feel like the buyer has lost the right to that refund by not sending the items back to me (He binned all 5 packets after opening 1?)

Ebay,First time seller having some problems.,"I've just wrapped up my first sell. But I've encountered a problem when it comes to the sell.

Ebay,Developed a site to get instant alerts on eBay.  I want you to try it for FREE!,"First of all, I was told about this site and told to post here asking for feedback on my site I started.  It has been running for about a year now and is doing great...  This is not spam at all and I want to make that clear.  I am not selling anything!

Clerts.com is a custom search and alert system for eBay. Basically, when an item you want to find matches your price range you get an alert that directs you to ebay to purchase. I designed it to alert a user of an item they want that is listed at a buy it now price that is too good to be true. Now you have a chance to buy the item when it is listed. 

There are also other ways to use Clerts.  You can use it to keep an eye on your market as a seller or just get updates on items.  Our site is easy to use and very simple and the emails/alerts you receive and not spammed and are very clean to view.

Ebay,Sellers: How do you handle bidders who never paid?,"Do you wait a certain amount of time and then report them to eBay? Do you let it go if it's under a certain amount? Do you email the buyer?

My situation: A buyer won an item for .99 (very small amount) on the 5th of October, I sent the buyer the invoice but did not hear from him since. 

The second one is for a watch in which the buyer won and is for $25 and was on the 4th. Invoice sent and nothing. 

I'm not worried about the .99 piece. I would like to get paid for the watch though. I know eBays rules state payment has to be made in 4 days or the buyer can open a case. Is that the route I want to go or should I try and reach out to the buyer myself? 

I don't want to get negative feedback and I don't want to cause more issues. 

I'm afraid to re-list the items because they can end up paying.

Ebay,I've been scammed by an Ebay seller and he even blocked my negative feedback - so he still has 100% positive!,"Here are the details.

1. You post MSOFFICE 2007 for sale.
2. I win the bid at $99.
3. I try and pay via EBAY.Com
4. The payment status says ""unclaimed""
5. Your Ebay account has the email address hhhhh_789@***.com
6. You contact me and claim that the email address is wrong 
7. You ask me to cancel the Ebay payment. I do this.
8. You ask me to send money directly to dddd***@gmail.com using PayPal
9. I am stupid and do what you ask.
10. You contact me and send me invoices from your company asking me to pay $99 (again!)
11. Paypal says that the $99 that I sent to dddd***@gmail already went to your company.
12. You try and get me to cancel the Ebay sale.
13. I am no longer so stupid. I refuse and I leave negative feedback.
14. You seem to be asking for me to pay $99 (again). But back in step 9 I paid $99 to you ALREADY.
15. You ask for proof that I paid you so I send a copy of the PayPal receipt which has your email address on it. You make no comment about this and continue the pretense that I haven't paid you.

The seller's ebay account still has his ""invalid email address"" which he claims he can't change. Any money sent to it to pay for the merchandise just has a status of ""unclaimed"". 

Then he said ""Ok, since you don't want to work with me, Ebay refunded my shipping fee, credited the seller fees, canceled the entire erroneous transaction, and also erased your negative feedback since the error was NOT ON MY END. ""  

Now what do I do?  He has continually refused to actually answer direct questions like ""Did you receive $99 from me on Sept 29?""  It is so frustrating.

Ebay,What can I do in this situation?,"Well I have two problems on ebay.

1.) I sold a bunch of items. The final value fee was wrong on my bill so I called ebay. After 5 calls, they finally fixed it to the correct amount. I paid it and then after that I deleted my paypal account and emptied all of my money into my schooling, I got a email back about a week later saying I didn't agree to the new sales agreement and no money was withdrawn. I now owe Ebay $80.00 in fees I can't pay.

2.) One of the last things I sold was sent unregistered lettermail. The seller claimed I didn't ship it because it hasn't arrived in 3 weeks (completely normal for sending something from canada to usa via lettermail) and Ebay automatically refunded him and charged my account. I was a fool to send a $90 item without a tracking number. I have strong reason to believe the buyer got it and is lying.

Anyway, I owe ebay roughly $170 now and I have an inactive bank account, no paypal account and about -$2,000 to my name (thanks university) and no way to get money at the moment because I work basically 24/7 on classes.

I can't contact ebay through email because they no longer have that option and I don't want to call them again in fear of them saving my phone number and sending it to a debt collection agency. 

I put fake info on my ebay account the second I got the email that I needed to re-send the first payment of $80 because I'm unable to send it.

Sellers are also advertising the phones as ""factory unlocked"" - but my understanding is that all Verizon iPhone 5's are unlocked - so couldn't I do the same?

Ebay,Hey reddit! I'm having trouble with an item I sold. Any help is appreciated!,"So a few days ago I sold an electric motor that was used once by me, I had the listing read ---

This esc/motor combo was used once then I pulled it out of my 1/16 slash. It's a great motor and very very reliable. I have one in my Ken Block car and its a screamer.

I clearly put that it was used, although I accidentally used a ""list one like this"" that was new so the tag said new and the description said used. Also I sent it on a label printed by eBay and it was returned because there was not enough postage. I sent it back immediately and paid extra money to get it there with tracking and insurance. Now when he receives it I got this message----

""these parts are NOT NEW,I ordered new ones and have waited over a week for them.
I can see where the remote was glued down and is covered in dirt!""

This was my reply.

In response to your message, I have to clear one thing up. I used a ""list one like this"" template and did not notice the ""new"" tag, but in the description 
I said this, in verbatim. ""This esc/motor combo was used once then I pulled it out of my 1/16 slash. It's a great motor and very very reliable. I have one in my Ken Block car and its a screamer. Thanks for looking!"" 
Yes I did use it, once. I took it out (it WAS glued down) and put it in my tool/parts box which I suppose has some residual dirt in it which caused the dirt on the glue. But that motor is clean, used less than one battery/ 30 minutes. I know I sent it in clean shape and I even went out and bought a box to protect it. I'm sorry if there is some dirt but that motor and esc is new.
I apologize for the delay, but I sent you messages and the reason for it being late. I feel that I did well as a seller and accurately described my product with the exception of accidentally not un-marking it ""used"", And i sincerely apologize for that.
If there is anything else I can clear up please let me know!

To which he replied 

i believe i'll just leave negative feed back, for false rep. on the part and the late shipping.

To which I replied,


I dont think that is fair at all. The description which I assume you read prior to purchase said that it was not a new item. And on the part of shipping It was not shipped correctly the first time (by the post office) and the second time I sent it immediately and even paid more shipping than you did to get it to you quickly. I understand your position on the shipping and will refund you your shipping if you really don't see eye to eye that i really did my best to get this item to you. I hope you reconsider this and either don't leave feedback or see that I really tried and avoid a negative. If there is anything else please contact me.

Thanks for your time,
A

He responded with this.

Just refund all of my money and you pick up ur used items and Then will move on 



So what can I do to avoid a negative and make this guy understand the product I sold is accurate? I really appreciate it guys! Thanks!",5,3,2012-10-23,EBAY,0.05161024630069733,0.9147709608078003,0.03361877426505089

Ebay,How can I best protect myself against fraudulent bidders?,"I have an iPhone 5 32gb brand new phone that I want to sell on eBay. I've been a seller for over 10 years and have 100% positive feedback. I haven't really sold that many items over the years, maybe about 100 total. I know that eBay's seller protection is now basically nothing, so I want to know the best way to protect myself from a buyer trying to scam me. 

The phone would be selling for upwards of $700.00 and I'm nervous about taking the risk. If paypal puts a hold on the payment and I ship out the phone (with delivery confirmation and signature required), what is to stop the buyer from saying that I didn't just ship an empty box or something other than the phone? Does this type of scam ever happen?

I'm very paranoid about selling such a high dollar item and having to ship it without actually having the money in my bank account.

Any help or comments would be much appreciated.

Ebay,Selling to South America - Mexico/Brazil,"Hi,

We currently sell on eBay to the United States. Half of out stuff is stocked in the USA, the other half the UK. Currently we only allow buyers from USA and Canada to buy our items, but I was thinking about adding Mexico and/or Brazil to the whitelist.

Has anyone any experience with this? I have heard their customers/postal services can be a nightmare. When we ship to the USA, we pride ourself on very quick delivery (often next day even when shipped from the UK). 

However I've heard that for Brazil or Mexico things tend to get held in customs for a long time? In the US we pre-pay all our customs fee's and things like that so it goes straight through.

Is this possible with Brazil or Mexico?

Ebay,Avoid seller Koolzap unless you have absolute faith what they send you is going to work exactly.,"**Exchange I had with eBay seller Koolzap who refuses to refund return shipping charges on defective items; I am willing to post pictures but for the sake of time, just read this exchange**

Dear koolzap,

This item arrived as defective. The metal mechanism that attaches to the door latch push rod is loose, meaning this handle will not operate the latch correctly. I want a full refund and I expect a refund of the return shipping as well. Please advise.

I'm afraid that the one from the warehouse may have the same problem. I've ordered three from two different companies. If there was some way for it to be inspected to make sure the part will work, I would have no problem with that. Please let me know if you need a picture of the problem.

Dear s*************

I just received your email with pictures of the two handles. The door handles are not broken or defective from what I understand reading your email,... they just seem to have been constructed/designed with a different mechanism than the handles on your car. 
What's the make, year and model of your car? 
What is your cars VIN number? 
Is you car a 4-door Sedan, or 2-Door Coupe?

I'd rather not give out the VIN number, as I don't believe it's necessary to locate the proper part. There is only one style of door handle for this year of car. Details to follow:

Dear s*************

I am not sure why sharing the VIN number would be a problem. I need that information to help resolve the issue and conduct an investigation. Like I had said the handles do not look defective or damaged. Our customer service representative seemed to have thought the part in the first shipment was damaged, when I read the communication between you and her and offered to replace the part for you for free, yet you never told her that the part was not defective or damaged but just different than the door handle you needed which at least would stop her from sending a 2nd part for free. I approved the reship of the order only because I was told the part was defective and damaged when in your email you say the part is just constructed differently. There was no need to reship this order. We have sent an extra part in good faith which we have not gotten paid for and have paid shipping twice since we have shipped this part for you twice. 
At this point like all other customers you must return both parts for a refund. Under our store police which you can read under ""Payments"" tab we charge a 20% restocking fee to recover our shipping cost which in this case I will waive to resolve this matter quickly. 
You need to send both handles to; 
Koolzap 
15857 Stagg Street 
Van Nuys, CA 91406 

Please put your name and user ID on the returning package. Please make sure to obtain a tracking number. Once we receive the parts back I will issue your refund. 
Please email me with any questions.

Thank you,

I'm not sharing the VIN number because I can tell you with absolute certainty (I've owned the car for six years) that there is only one trim level for this model year, thus only one compatible door handle. IF you had looked at the original listing, you would see that it says it is 100% compatible with my car (all trim levels). For that reason, if I had the wrong handle to begin with, I would not have known. (see below)

I might also add that it appears on the listing still.

That being said, I will remit the cost of shipping to you via email. I expect a reimbursement in addition to the purchase price. Had the listing been correct, I would have known that this was the wrong part and this may have been resolved when I requested a refund in the first place. Now, not only have you wasted over a week of my time messing with emails and taking pictures, I still don't have a functioning handle and have to make a trip out of my way to the post office. 

As of right now I will not be leaving any feedback on your page. If this isn't resolved to my satisfaction (read: reimbursement for the return shipping and for the product), I will be filing claim with Paypal and leaving negative feedback on your page. A quick Google search shows your parent company, Iconic Trading Co, to which I will also make a complaint. I am willing to go as far as the BBB if this is not resolved to my satisfaction plus I will post to your Amazon vendor page as well.

Just remember, this listing is your problem, not mine (read: it's incorrect). I bought it and accepted the replacement under the impression that they were the right part (see the listing pictures posted above). You will make this right.

Regards,

s*************

I am giving you that even without knowing what the VIN number is. In fact that is very evident because I sent the 2nd handle to you for free in good faith. However I think now that you have received the 2nd door handle it is unfair to know expect us to pay to return them for a refund when you could have simply asked us to pay to return the first handle since  you knew the part was not damaged just different. Still I am not saying you are not entitled to get a refund. I also said I will waive the 20% restocking fee but you must return the parts to us for a full refund. I think as much as this maybe our mistake (assuming you ordered the correct part), it is your mistake to ask us to reship the order.

If you read the original correspondence you would see that I asked if the replacement part had the same issue. I was simply told it was fine and not given a choice. Again I expect a refund of the original purchase price to which you've already agreed and the return shipping. The receipt and the tracking number are in a separate email.

Ebay,Crazy Chargeback scam - Please help - Ebay/Paypal employees please take a look,"Hi,

Basically I sell jewellery on ebay, I sold a pendant to a guy in Italy on 25th July who then did a CC chargeback 80 days later through paypal (scamming me obviously).


I just lost the case today in paypal because I couldn't show the item had proof of delivery even though the guy said it was an ""unauthorised transaction"". I just put his email into facebook after trying to find him all week and behold, there he is on his facebook banner picture wearing the pendant I sold him!

Please advise on what I should do further. Obviously I don't rate paypal customer support much so if a paypal employee could help me out here it really would be greatly appreciated. I assume his credit card company won't be too happy with his fraud either but that's his problem now. Filthy scumbag.


**UPDATE 1** Ebay have done nothing but then again it didn't really have much to do with them. Paypal have said that as the bank has made its final decision there is not much I can do, I think this is just bad for me but a reasonable decision as they don't seem to have the power to do anything. I can put in some sort of appeal which isn't of much use as I must send a paper mail to Luxembourg and even then I might not get any money back. So for now it looks like I will be writing to his friends and family.

**UPDATE 2** I have contacted the scammer through facebook asking him to repay my money. I havn't threatened anything because I think it makes me look bad, I also have no threats to give because he is in another country, I also asked him why he does this to people. However if he ignores this and hides I still have all of his family/friends contact details and pictures of him saved so I will be in touch with them if I don't hear anything by Monday. I will keep you all updated.


**UPDATE 3** Well it's now November 19th. I contacted him and his 2 brothers through facebook and email. They all actually got really scared of me, didn't respond to any messages and have now deleted / hidden / deactivated their facebook profiles. Sadly for him I saved the facebook and email details of around 30 more friends and family. If I have a bad day in the near future I'll probably be sending them an email telling them he stole from me, but i'll probably just let it settle for a week.

**UPDATE 4** I thought I had already done this but basically the chargeback got reversed once again and he had to pay me back. Maybe it was because I harassed his brother so much, I dont know.",24,11,2012-10-25,EBAY,0.16008113324642181,0.8173236846923828,0.022595219314098358
Ebay,Buyer won auction but isn't paying because he found cheaper alternative.,"So I recently sold my first ebay auction for 35 dollars which was already a really great deal seeing as the item was brand new and sold at a fraction of what can be found at retail.

I understand that I could just sell it to the next person but seeing as this is my first time selling on ebay, this seems unfair. Is the ebay world really a place that favors the buyers and there's nothing I can do as a seller?

Those of you that have already have you found the benefits worth the monthly fee?,"I have a small eBay store that's a little over a year old (avg. 150-200 listings currently). I have been quite happy with the results I've gotten so far from the time I've devoted to it. I am always trying to find better, more efficient ways of running the store and the information I've gathered about Terapeak, on the surface, sounds like an avenue I could take to help with this. But I am a little nervous jumping into it. Have any of you used Terapeak and if so have you found it's benefits worth the cost?",5,1,2012-10-28,EBAY,0.01914341375231743,0.8669266700744629,0.1139298528432846
Ebay,Perma-banned by Ebay today,"I recently created an Ebay account with interest in purchasing some used guitar equipment.  I'm in the military and my wife and I don't have much money, but playing guitar is something that I really enjoy in my off time.  Ebay seemed like a great route since I'd be able to get my a hold of some used gear--and that would make my hobby a bit cheaper.

I'm currently stationed overseas.  I live in the UK, but as a courtesy, the US military gives us a US post address--it is commonly known as an APO/FPO address.  

When I registered my Ebay account, I put in my APO address, but then was unable to put in my UK phone number due to formatting.  I proceeded to use my parents US telephone number in order to complete my account information--I can only assume that this is what caused the hiccup which led to my permanent ban from Ebay.

About a week ago, I *finally* won my first auction.  I had been bidding on this used guitar multi-effects pedal from Line-6.  I was STOKED because I got the pedal for less than half of retail--it was supposed to be my birthday money.  As soon as I won the auction, I paid via Paypal, and messaged the seller to say that I was happy I'd won, and if there were any issues in mailing due to my APO address that he/she should contact me (no one has ever had any issues mailing anything to me through my APO address--it mails just like any other packages aside from a customs form).

Minutes later, I received a non-specific email from Ebay saying that my account had been suspended for security issues.  I blew it off for a few days thinking that it must have been a mistake, but finally I decided to call Ebay to figure out what I needed to do to reinstate my account.

I talked with multiple people until I was transferred to the dept. that would be able to help me.  In a nutshell, I was told that Ebay wouldn't tell me exactly why I had been banned, but that there was no appeal process for me to dispute my ban.  I asked to speak with a manager, but 'she was in a meeting'.  I told them that I'd like to receive a phone call or an email from someone in management to discuss why I was banned.

Am I crazy?  I cannot be the only member of the US military with an APO using Ebay.

So far, the whole process has been completely frustrating, and I do not feel like Ebay's customer support has given me a fair shake at rebutting my ban.

Is there anything that I can do?",8,14,2012-10-29,EBAY,0.04069492593407631,0.9288371801376343,0.030467933043837547
Ebay,New to Ebay Please Help,Hey everyone I recently was let go from my job and I was going to try something I have always wanted to do...start my own business.

Ebay,"Unusual offer, at least to me as a new Seller.","I just listed my item on ebay for not even an hour and I received a message from a buyer  saying the following. I am unsure whether to say yes or not. Is this a common practice for buyers on ebay and is there any harm in agreeing to her offer?

***As a first-time business relationship of ours; Would you give me the free shipping for this item once I'm lucky to win this bid( your shipping charge will be used for my best bidding amount instead ). Likely it will help me to be the best bidder (many sellers often did it to get more attention from the interested bidders' highest bidding price).

Ebay,Possible scammer?,"Hello, I am selling an item on eBay (about $460) and someone, about 2 days ago, bought it. It was on Buy it Now, and the buyer sent me an email in broken English to send pictures and that she would purchase the item once I sent a money request to PayPal and include more pictures of the item in the email. I did this, and have not seen another email from her since. I sent her one or two emails asking about whether she was planning to buy the item, but I can't get her to respond. I looked at her feedback. Oddly enough, she had all positive, but the last 5 reviews said how she was a scammer that sent fake payments/didn't pay at all. I'm kinda nervous about this, this being my first sale on eBay. Is there any way I can close the sale without having to wait 4 days? What should I do in this situation?   

EDIT: eBay just emailed me saying that they closed the buyer's account due to multiple causes of fraud. They cancelled my transaction. What a stroke of luck. Thanks guys!",4,5,2012-10-29,EBAY,0.058582741767168045,0.8909086585044861,0.05050855875015259

Ebay,Banned from auctions?,"So my mother's friend has been bidding on lots of designer hand bags lately. Some sellers have somehow banned her from bidding. She always pays promptly and asks for registered post to make sure she gets her stuff.

Why would a seller ban someone from bidding on an item when they do in fact pay?

She asked my mother to bid on her stuff for her, but then she gets banned by a few sellers. These sellers all have feedback scores of less than 50.

So now they're asking me to bid on them. I don't mind, I don't care if I'm banned from bidding on handbags (I'm a dude), just curious why a seller would deny themselves a sure sell, especially when these ladies aren't too picky on their final bid (most of the bags I've been asked to bid on are sold at $250-300 and their highest bids are in the 400's.)

tl;dr - Handbag hunters banned from auctions; why?",15,4,2012-10-30,EBAY,0.10969812422990799,0.8666877150535583,0.02361421287059784
Ebay,Returns: how long to wait for reply from Seller?,"I guess I have had amazing luck over the past (yikes) 14 years on Ebay, and have never had to return anything. Now, however, I have something that I need to return, because the condition is way worse than described (seriously, there is no nitpicking involved on my part).

I'm probably over-thinking it, but how long is generally appropriate to expect a reply from a seller with regards to a return -- especially one that says that returns are accepted? Is three business days without a reply sufficient grounds to begin the dispute/resolution process, or is that jumping the gun?

(I believe that PayPal gives you up to 45 days to do this. And I also know that I can just go ahead an dispute, esp. as there's no way for the seller to leave me negative, retaliatory, feedback... but still, I made it this far with 100% perfect feedback because of being prompt and communicating well, and I'd rather not change my ways.)
