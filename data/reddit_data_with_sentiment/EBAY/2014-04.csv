Ebay,Require another opinion on a situation...(Story Inside),"Yesterday I bid for a laptop I really wanted and won. The seller posted this:

""So I will not ship until paypal has transferred the money from pay pal to my bank to wear I can withdraw the cash only then will I ship UPS with a tracking number and signature required. That might take 7+ days for that transfer. So please don't expect shipment right away just because you won the bid. If you can accept that you must wait 7+ days till I have transfer and cash in my hand then go ahead and bid. IF its transfers in less then 7 days I will notify you when the transfer is complete and I will ship the next day. Because I work allot of hours and I don't have much time.""

In fairness the above paragraph WAS in the items description the entire time and I knew that going in. Still I would like another opinion. I have every intention to complete the transaction as I usually pay for my items immediately after I win. However something in my gut is telling me to be cautious. Does this sound sketchy to anyone else?

TLDR: Seller says he won't send the package until he has the money in hand from the bank. I knew that before hand. I think it sounds sketch. What do you think?

**UPDATE** So shit pretty much hit the fan. You can read about it here.

I spoke to the vendor they asked me to send it back, and now two months later they're saying that they've sent it to the manufacturer and that as soon as they receive it back, they'll send it back to us.

They way I see it, my contract is with them to supply a functioning camera, not with the manufacturer.

Ebay,How long to wait before opening item not described case?,"I consider myself pretty knowledgeable with ebay but I've never had a problem like this. With this being a high dollar transaction it's making me a little more anxious to solve the problem as soon as possible.

So I bought 15 tablets from a seller on ebay, they were advertised as new sealed tablets. More than half of the tablets arrived with their seals ripped as if it were an open box item. Inside the open box the item looked new; however, I'm in the business of reselling. I have no use for open product; If they are listed as factory sealed it should arrive factory sealed. 

The tablets were shipped in 15 individual boxes without any packing materials in these dirty boxes (my hands were left black after opening); I'm guessing that the item just moved around so much during shipment that the seals broke. The items that arrived sealed showed some wear to the seal itself which is why I assume the product was torn open during shipment/storage/moving around. 

It's been 26 hours from the first contact. When should I move forward with a case? So annoying, this could have easily been avoided with 10 cents worth of packing material, but now I have 3k worth of tablets with broken seals that I need to return.",4,2,2014-04-02,EBAY,0.036432672291994095,0.9048518538475037,0.05871547758579254
Ebay,retaliatory feedback,"I bought a laptop (I collect vintage models of certain lines) from a seller but before bidding I asked about the paint on the keys. Seller said there was no wear at all. I get the laptop and several keys are badly worn and there's a crack on the underside of the chassis. None of this was described or visible from the photos.

I msged the seller to ask for a refund. Seller says OK, but when I asked to also be refunded return shipping (which is not negligible), he basically tells me, ""don't push it"" in that tone, though I pointed out (politely) that I would not have bought the laptop if he had described it accurately.

My question is 
1) what kind of feedback should I leave him
2) though he left me feedback (he did it as soon as I paid), I'm afraid if I neg or neutral him he'll come back and leave follow-up comments to the feedback he left me. I don't want a bunch of messages saying negative things under the feedback he left on my (otherwise spotless) feedback page. I have never left anyone a neg/neut before. I know eBay does not allow ""neg pos feedback"" but does that apply to follow-up comments as well ? How easy is it to get one removed ?

Ebay,Shipping Bobbleheads Still in Box,"I apologize ahead of time if this isn't appropriate for this subreddit. 

I am selling on eBay for the first time and was wondering what the recommended way would be to ship a bobblehead still in its box. I've read it's easier and less expensive to print the labels yourself; would it be ok to place the bobblehead box into another slightly larger box, wrapping it discretely and securely taping the shipping label on that?

I'd imagine just wrapping the bobblehead box wouldn't be satisfactory as it'd leave the item open to damage. On top of the above question, are there any other bits of advice any buyers of bobbleheads that may be reading may have?

Ebay,I've gotten my first international purchase through the global shipping program and I had a question in regards to refunds,"I mailed out an item today with insurance and all that today, and a thought crossed my mine as I looked at the shipping the customer paid

If a buyer wants a refund, say because of non-delivery or something.

do I have to refund the total amount they paid and then hope that my claim is accepted? or do I ust refund what I charged, and eBay refunds what they charged? or do they not get refunded for the shipping?

I figure it's the first, after all buyer is responsible usually to make things right with non-deliveries, but it's not fair at the same time if I have to refund say $18 that ebay charges for shipping internationally because the item never makes it there, when I could have shipped the package for half that price, if my insurance claim doesn't go through.

Ebay,"Sold Item, Free Shipping, Item Returned, Wrong Address, Questions about Re-shipping Item?","So I sold an item to a guy half way across the country. I labeled it as free shipping as to sell the item fast. Well, it did. I shipped this item as Standard Post, and because it's a larger item, it cost $11.00 to ship. The item being sold was $49.00. They person who bought the item, had an old address listed and has since then changed address on PayPal and Ebay to show the new address. I have the item, as it has shipped back to me. I've been in contact with the seller. 

Question 1. Do I have to resend the item using more money out of my pocket? $49 - $11 - $11 - Ebay and paypal fees of around $5 = $22.00 that I'm going to see out of all of this if that is the route I take.

Question 2. Should I explain this to the buyer, and make them pay for shipping this second time, buy sending me $11.00 through paypal? I know this isn't part of the agreement when originally buying this item, but I feel that this is the buyers mistake of not having their new address posted to paypal and ebay. I would get in a sense $33.00 out of my item this way. I feel like this is the best way.

Question 3. Should I cancel the sale, refund customer $49.00, be out $11 for shipping, and sell item locally through word of mouth or social media, and sell item for $60.00, which is doable, since the item I'm selling brand new retails at stores for $129.00. I would then pocket my $49.00 I originally wanted to sell it for, and at the time, I thought shipping would be around $5.00, and not $11.00.

Ebay,"Currently dealing with a buyer (and his opened case) who is using his opinion as reason to accuse me of selling ""fake"" merchandise...","I sold a numbered, limited edition baseball card that contained a patch of a ""game worn"" jersey worn by the player on the card.

Is it possible competitors are clicking on my item and not obviously not buying to lower my ranking?,2,2,2014-04-04,EBAY,0.4644971191883087,0.4051511585712433,0.13035178184509277
Ebay,Buyer wants me to ship them a pre paid envelope with postage inside of another envelope so they can return an item.,"Sold I sold an as-is iPod nano 1st generation for 19.95. About a week after the buyer received it they open up a case with the following quote. ""THE IPOD NANO IS A 2ND GENERATION NOT A 1ST GENERATION AS WAS STATED IN THE AD. I HAVE CHECKED THE SERIAL NUMBER."" 


Okay. That's my fault. I picked it up at a flea market for cheap and just assumed. 


But, if he had just messaged me instead of opening up a case, things would've been alot smoother. I could've gifted him the 19.95 through paypal and he would've sent it back and that would be that. Instead, paypal is holding 19.95 from me so I have -2.43$ as my balance right now. But that's off topic. Anyways, I ask him to send back the item, and he responds with this

""Well you please email me a free address tracking label so i can send the ipod back.""


Me- ""How do I email you the label?""


""You could just buy a pre paid envelope and then mail it to me in a different envelope. Them when i receive it i can mail the ipod back to you""


I then offered to gift him an extra 2$ through paypal once I receive the item to cover shipping.
Me mailing him an envelope so he can mail seems very unnessecary and quite frankly, dumb. 


He hasn't responded in 2 days. What do I do?

**Update:**

Me-""That seems extremely unesscesary. Just pay for the shipping yourself and I'll give you an extra 2$ once I recieve the item.""


""Its extremely unreasonable you sent me the wrong generation ipod . Just please send me a pre paid envelope so i can send the ipod back. ""

Ebay,Selecting no return policy shows up differently in my sales.,"I recently sold an item that the buyer now wants to return. I always select no returns on my ebay items when I sell because I don't want to deal with the hassle.

&gt;Seller did not specify a returns policy. You are covered by the eBay Money Back Guarantee - opens in a new window or tab if you received an item that is not as described in the listing. 

This seems misleading because I did select a return policy... ?

On top of that the buyer used the global shipping program. What am I responsible for paying as far as returns in that aspect? I didn't select a return policy so I don't feel I should be responsible for the ridiculous international shipping fees when they decide to return it.

Ebay,So I am probably about to get ripped off via Paypal/ Ebay for an item I just shipped out.,"I had an expensive video game for bid.  I had a buy it now option for the game and someone with zero feedback bought it and paid right away. I was a little suspicious because it was a day away from ending and had a pretty high BIN.  Although their account status didn't say verified in Paypal their address is listed as ""confirmed"".

I was really, really hesitant to ship out the item and googled a couple threads on shipping to zero feedback ebayers.  There were some warnings, but a lot were saying ""everyone starts at zero at some point"" if they have a confirmed address ship it out once they pay you.

I even went as far as calling PayPal to confirm it is ok to send to a ""confirmed"" address and whether it would be covered by Seller Protection.  The rep said it should, but who knows, I'm not sure they were 100% correct. 

So I print out a shipping label from ebay for USPS Priority Mail and dropped it off at the post office today. Sure enough as soon as the tracking info hits ebay and the USPS website, I get an email from paypal saying the buyer disputes the transaction and my funds are being held.  Anyone ever go through this before? Did you ever get your money back.  Did you call law enforcement?

**Final Update:** Paypal ended up releasing the payment to me, but kept the case open.  After reading all these horror stories about Paypal, I just wanted my item back.  USPS 1-800 number and my local post office were useless.  Local office didn't know how to intercept a package and people at the toll free number gave me majorly incorrect info.

Me: Packing slip? We don't use packing slips. Can you please tell me if the envelope was opened before you got it? 

Buyer: No I'm telling u I have nothing!! Please can u refund my money??

Me: We will send a replacement. 

Buyer: So im i getting my money back? Or do i need to open a case w eBay??

Me: We are sending a replacement. If the item is truly not in the box a replacement should be acceptable.

Just keep it the money and ur part I don't want to deal w you anymore! I will get one from the somewhere else and at least they treat me w respect! Thanks for nothing

Me: I will send a refund, please do not get upset.

Looking through his feedback lots of them are negative saying ""empty box"", ""never received item"", etc.  Some are positive saying ""seller knows how to make things right""

So I called ebay and they told me he had been ""actioned"" in the past, whatever that means. Apparently it means nothing because his account is still active.  He was getting lots of partial and full refunds. 

So I messaged every business he has bought from recently and explained what he is doing.  So far 4 members have messaged back stating the same thing happened to them. I told all of them to report him. 

I still haven't sent a refund and don't plan on it. Ebay told me I would be protected against negative feedback.

Ebay,Does anyone A/B test their auctions?,"Hi everyone

I've been doing some thinking on what makes auctions succeed on eBay, and I'm pretty convinced that the title, image and wording have a massive impact - in some cases more than the price. Getting your auction found - and then clicked on - is a big hurdle that a lot of auctions don't make it past.

Does anyone A/B test their stuff? Like change some wording or the picture and run it again to see if it sells more? How do you monitor that if so?

I haven't taken the plunge on Terapeak, is this something they allow you to do?

Ebay,What type of web hosting service would I need to use for hosting my own pictures?,"Hello,

I'm looking to start  / grow my eBay business.  I'm looking to host my own pictures, and link them to my eBay account.  

Ideally, within my code, i want to have my pictures in code form look something like this:

mypictures.com/ebay01/watermarkedimages/cats

(hopefully that makes sense).

Now, I've gotten two different answers to the type of web hosting service I would need to go for.

The first one was this web hosting package from godaddy (http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting.aspx?ci=9009).  I was going to go with the ""deluxe"" package for a very reasonable 4.49$/Month.

The second answer I got to my question was a VPS (Virtual Private Server) from godaddy
(http://www.godaddy.com/hosting/vps-hosting.aspx?isc=GPPT03C500&amp;ci=87229)

As you see, the cheapest VPS is roughly 30$/Month

Ebay,Question about tickets to a cancelled event (Masters 2014),"I purchased 4 tickets to the Monday practice round for the Masters this year.  I paid $50 each for them - purchased directly through The Masters.

I sold 3 of these on Ebay in October for $350 each.  I sold the other last week for $250.

The tickets were for today.  They opened the gates and allowed people in.  However, due to the weather, they closed the gates sometime around mid-morning and everyone had to leave.  

The Masters is issuing a refund to the original purchaser (me) for $50 each.  I will get the refund in May.  In addition to the refund, I will also be given the chance to purchase tickets to the 2014 practice rounds.   I couldn't go this year, but I do plan on going next year.

So my question is - do the buyers have any right to a refund?  

I do not want to rip anyone off, but I also don't have the money to give the October buyer a refund for $1050.  Since last week's buyer just purchased the ticket I still have their $250 and could (would) issue them a refund if they ask.

Ebay,"Buyer returned different &amp; broken item, any advice?","A buyer purchased a PSP from me.  In case you dont know, a PSP is a handheld game system by Sony Playstation.

He returned it and told me it arrived damaged and not working.  The returned PSP came back to me last Monday, but its definately not the system I sent him.  Its really dirty and has alot of scuffs and dings, the screen also has alot of little scratches.  It doesnt work.  But the serial number matches the one I sold him perfectly.  Im thinking he somehow switched off the serial numbers.

Well I sent the guy a message through ebay about this.  He's one of those people that types in all caps.  He says I'm just trying to weasel my way out of a refund.  And that he's an honest person.  So he opened a case against me, and ebay sided with him and gave him a refund.

Now I called ebay, and explained this to them.  I even took pictures to show the returned PSP.  But ebay is treating me like I'm the bad guy.  
When I called ebay and explained what happened, the lady that I was speaking with said there was nothing ebay could do after that case is decided.  I told her what about sellers protection, and she said that only applies to if a buyer claims the item was not received.

Ebay,I'm so scared... I want to sell an expensive watch. How can I protect against scams?,"##Background##
*****  

I have been browsing this subreddit aggressively the past week. This is a great community with tons of advice, insight, and experience. Also, tons of horror stories.

I want to sell a Tag Heuer watch I was given as a gift.  After researching the market for this watch, I believe I have found the right market value for it.  

I made a [post on /r/watches](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/21yizf/tag_heuer_ct2112_im_trying_to_see_what_this_watch/), and a kind redditor estimated the value that was pretty much dead on with my estimation: 
&gt; ""I think $800-1200 is a reasonable price range.. near the top if you're patient, near the bottom if you want to sell it ASAP"".  

*Additional Information:*

* I am not a frequent seller. Ex. I recently sold two items and Paypal is holding the money.
* I don't have any official COA for this item.
* I am selling this item because I need the money (gap between freelance projects).  I can't really stomach losing the watch to a scam.

##My Strategy##
*****  


After reading all of the advice of this subreddit, here's what I plan to do...

*Listing Options:*

* List it using Buy It Now to ensure I get paid ($1200 for this watch).
* Enable the ""Best Offer"" option 
* Ship only to the US
* Require delivery confirmation signature
* Block non-US paypal accounts (in Paypal account settings)
* Offer free shipping


*Block Buyers Who:*

* Don't have a PayPal account
* Have received 2 Unpaid Item strike(s) within 6 Month(s)
* Have a primary shipping address in a location I don't ship to
* Have 4 Policy Violation report(s) within 6 Month(s)
* Have a feedback score of -1 or lower 


##Questions##
*****  

* What other settings/approaches am I missing?

* A lot of people have mentioned marking the item to ensure returns are genuine - this may not be possible with this item. Any suggestions?

* **Is the risk even worth it** or should I just keep trying Craigslist?

Ebay,Lack of fairness to sellers,"I know very well that eBay generates its profits from increased traffic.  Buyers drive the marketplace and the sellers pay the fees.  I'm fine with that.  However, my eBay fees have continued to go up over the years and the services and entitlements I once had as seller have drastically decreased.  

In the past six months I've:

Lost an eBay case because a buyer purchased an iPhone from me that I sold as an AT&amp;T phone that he expected to have me work with AT&amp;T to unlock it for him.  After finding out that I would not, he claimed there were scratches on the phone that I didn't advertise.  His change in story is well-documented, but eBay doesn't actually read the correspondence, they just side with the buyer.

Had to relist a MacBook that sold because the buyer said they could no longer pay.  That's incredibly annoying and I should be able to leave them negative feedback.  I can't.  

Had to relist two sets of foglights for an Accord that were both won 5 minutes apart by the same buyer.  He refused to respond to an invoice with combined shipping though he never requested it, multiple attempts at contacting him through eBay or a Facebook friend request after a little more investigating.  Again, I'm not able to leave negative feedback for him during or after the eBay case for non-payment.

Had to relist another iPhone that a buyer won claiming that they wouldn't be able to pay until 9 days after the auction ended.  I protested, but they won anyway.  They didn't tell me until minutes before auction end.  Before the 9 days came the eBay case opened and closed.  I e-mailed the day after the day that they said they would be able to pay and they apologized for any inconveniences.  I asked them to pay once more and they chose not to respond.  Ask me if I could leave them negative feedback.

Why is this?  Why is it when I've been wronged-comparatively slightly compared to what some others go through-that I don't even have the ability to tell other eBay members about it?  If it were the other way around and I had simply shipped two days later than what they were told that they could reasonably expect their item, they would have full ability to tell the world about it and leave me negative feedback.  Why is it that the system is set up so that I perform well out of fear instead of the fact that it's the right thing to do?",49,15,2014-04-10,EBAY,0.06682450324296951,0.8928460478782654,0.0403294675052166
Ebay,Question about using Paypal dispute to get money back after Fedex messed up?,"Ok here's a little backstory to frame my question. I order and refurbish used laptops so I deal a lot with eBay and the big three delivery companies. A couple of days ago Fedex stated my package had arrived and was placed on my porch, I get home about 5 hours later and there is no package or door tag at my residence. I immediately go to the Fedex ground shipping office in my town and ask them a couple of questions about it. They say that I have to call corporate and submit ""ground tracing"" case. So I call and they say it will take a couple of days to put all of the details together. I would also like to point out that since I've lived in my current location, single house with decent sized front yard off of a pretty major road, I have had over 50-70 packages delivered with no issue, mostly through USPS and UPS but a couple of Fedex deliveries thrown in there. 

Fast forward to today, I get a call this morning from Fedex's ""ground tracing"" department and they basically tell me, driver thinks that he delivered to the correct house that's all we can do. They told me I should open a Paypal dispute and get my money back. 

Now my question is, if I do a Paypal dispute and clarify that Fedex essentially lost my package (or was stolen but I highly doubt that) will they pull the money from the seller or is there some sort of Paypal insurance for this? Will Paypal even do anything? Being a seller myself, I dont want to take away someone's profit just because they used a sub-par delivery service. The laptop that was lost/stolen was only worth $50 with shipping in its current state so I would be willing to eat that cost to not screw over the other seller who shipped the laptop next day.",19,7,2014-04-10,EBAY,0.052971769124269485,0.9220981597900391,0.024930056184530258

Because of the volume everything wouldn't fit into a large flat rate box so the shipping costs would have been over $27. I offered free shipping so it would have significantly cut into my profits.

Ebay,My email to eBay to appeal my indefinite selling restriction,"I've spoken with eBay on the phone, and they told me that I have a chance to appeal this. A few months ago, this restriction was put in place because I had a lot of open eBay cases on my account, due to lost shipments and very long delivery times to a few specific countries. I believe I only have one shot at this appeal, so it would be great to get some feedback before I send it off:

Dear eBay team member,

On February 19, 2014, I received a notice from eBay informing me that my selling priveleges had been restricted. At the time, I had quite a few ""item not received"" eBay cases on my hands, and I believe these cases raised some flags on my account and led to the selling restriction.

I will start from the beginning and explain everything as clearly as I can. I believe that if eBay is fully informed of the situation, we will be able to continue doing business together, and work together to provide customers around the world with high quality products and excellent customer service. I run an honest business and 100% customer satisfaction is extremely important to me. 

I have been selling brand new, brand-name cell phones on eBay since July 2012. I ship internationally from Hong Kong, and my main markets had always been Russia, Argentina, USA, Canada, and Israel. When I shipped to Russia, Argentina, and Israel, I used EMS and the post office, mainly due to shipping costs. I never had a problem with these shipping methods and I have shipped hundreds of packages this way, for over two years. Everything ran smoothly with my business and my customers were always 100% satisfied, until late 2013. My shipments to Argentina and Russia were taking a very long time to arrive. By January 2014, more than 1 month had gone by with some of these deliveries, and my customers were understandably upset and becoming worried about their orders. They began opening eBay cases for item not received. This problem continued to grow worse and some of the shipments never turned up at all. I eventually found out that it was a very serious, long-term situation involving a few specific countries that I did a lot of business with, and I have suffered some very heavy consequences: My perfect record of customer satisfaction was tarnished. I lost my 100% positive feedback rating after receiving some negatives. I lost thousands of dollars from lost shipments. I am no longer able to profit from selling smartphones to Argentina and Russia, due to the risks involved. Last but not least, my eBay selling priveleges were restricted, and as I write this, I understand that there is no guarantee that I will have my selling priveleges restored.

I understand that eBay will only be interested in accepting my appeal and restoring my selling priveleges if I have taken the necessary steps to prevent these problems from occurring again. The solution is very straightforward. I will only ship with the most reliable couriers: FedEx, UPS, and DHL. This will reduce the number of countries I can ship to, but it will also eliminate the risks involved with shipping. I am also going to begin selling some less expensive items like cell phone accessories, to increase my total number of sales and raise my feedback score &amp; seller performance rating. I would very much like an opportunity to prove to eBay and to my customers that my business is back on track and moving in the right direction. I feel very confident that my business will be successful with these new changes, if my selling priveleges are restored and I am given another shot. At this time, I do not have any open eBay cases, and I plan to keep it that way.

Thank you very much for your time. I look forward to continuing our business relationship together.

Ebay,INAD case: Am I being irrational?,"So, this particular buyer bought this item, and also low-balled me on another item - wanted a discount of around 25%. I was willing to take 20% off, but even that wasn't enough. So, for starters, I wasn't happy with this particular buyer in the first place. 

So, I send out the other item, and of course, the buyer opens an INAD case. I should note, this is a Super Famicom game (The Japanese equivalent of the Super Nintendo). They are notorious for having yellowed backs, to the point that I don't even mention it, usually. I always list the games as acceptable, except, for some stupid reason I missed it in this listing. These backs are easily replaced, I should note. 

[Here is the conversation so far (Read from the bottom)](http://i.imgur.com/SoPrPiw.jpg)

So, for $5 I can ""pay him off"" to make him go away. But, I can't help but feel like he doesn't really care about the back, its just a way to milk me for money. Sending him two new backs fixes the problem, and also gives him a free extra one to use on a future game.

Ebay,"New to eBay selling, big-ticket auction ending soon, worried about getting scammed. Help?","Hi all,

I won an iPad Air at my work recently and tried it out briefly before deciding I didn't particularly need it, so I listed it on eBay. It's been 6 days and my auction is almost closed. I've got a couple bids, but I'm getting really worried about being ripped off. I'm not sure how to avoid it so I'm hoping you guys can help me.

Right now I have two bidders on the item. Bidder A has bid twice and is the current top, is based in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and has 1 positive feedback (member since 12-31-13). Bidder B has bid once, is based in Tanzania, and has 19 positive feedback (member since 6-12-12).

I know sellers can *only* leave positive feedback now, but I read everything manually and there were no ""BAD SELLER DIDNT PAY"" etc. feedback posts (they were all actually positive).

But still, I'm worried about selling to international buyers (especially in tiny countries like these, I have no idea what the laws around stuff like eBay are like there) with low feedback. I've heard horror stories about honest buyers getting ripped off with false ""item not as described"" claims, and it sounds like eBay/PP are generally not on the seller's side in these cases. What should I do? Would you trust either of these buyers, should I relist for US bidders only, or should I just use facebook etc. to try and sell locally..?

Ebay,Successfully shipped a bubble mailer through the mail(box). Have any of you tried this and had it backfire?,"I sell Magic and Pokemon cards on eBay with the majority of my shipments processed through first class packaging. Like many card sellers shipment is normally done with first class mail, or with a plain white envelope ($.49).
Shipments sometimes get kind of annoying when the item sold is between $3 - $6 because the disparity in profit between the shipment methods for lower priced items take a huge hit. Nonetheless I take the safer route and and pay for first class packaging. 

So I tried to reduce the cost of shipping, all the while maintaining protection for my cards, by placing 2 forever stamps on a 4x6 bubble mailer which weighed under 1oz.
I added two stamps so that they would at least consider a nonmachinable sorting method for my package, to play the ignorant shipper, and simply because didn't know if it would work.

In the end the customer commended me for my packaging and was satisfied with his card. I have yet to send out another bubble mailer through the mail because I was pretty nervous about having the package returned to me the first time around. 

Have any of you tried placing stamps on a bubble mailer?
Did it backfire? If it went through did your customer ever have to pay for additional postage?

Ebay,Lost some money on this sale-Help?,"So, I've been selling Baseball and sports cards, memorabilia, etc. on ebay for a month or 2 now. All of my sales have been shipped to the U.S. I just started using turbolister and just listed about 150 items last week. Just to make international shipping available, I put it down as ""calculated"" and I could've sworn I put a $3.00 handling charge but I guess I forgot. Now, someone just bought a card for $4, and hes from italy. Ebay calculated the shipping to be about $5, which the guy paid for with the item. When, I go to pay and print my shipping label, I see its $8. So now, I'd be making $1 on the sale, without whatever ebay and paypal will take. However, I normally charge $3 shipping for domestic orders on cards, since the shipping is about $2 and the extra $1 covers my penny sleeve, top loader, teambag, bubble mailer, etc. (everything I need to ship). Is there anything I can do? Or do I just have to bite the bullet and lose the money on this sale and then change my international shipping policy on all my other items?

Ebay,Questions about accounting with eBay &amp; Paypal,"I am downloading .csv/excel files and trying to track my sales and expenses and am having issues with the 2 sites not meshing. Maybe I am over-thinking things.

Ebay sales reports show what I have sold for the month as monthly sales, as well as the eBay &amp; Paypal fees that I will incur for those sales. Paypal shows what payments I have received for the chosen  month and the payments that I have made toward eBay fees, etc. for the month. The two are not necessarily the same as someone who bought a widget on March 30th may not pay until April 2nd. Also, Paypal's reports do not allow the Paypal fees to be downloaded in their reports so when I look at the sale I had on eBay of $43.99 and go to download the Paypal  history report, it shows a payment to me of $42.41 because the Paypal fees are automatically deducted. 

Nowhere in the Paypal report does it give a tally of Paypal fees, just the post-fee payment. (I can download my monthly statement which does show PP fees, but it is a PDF and does not actually add up the fees of each transaction, of which I have hundreds a month), so when I try to download all of my total sales from Paypal, the sales figure is actually all of my payments minus Paypal fees, which are not my sales. If I try to download all of my sales from ebay Sales Reports, refunds are absent, and shipping cost that I paid are not an option in the report.

I guess my question is, Is there a more user-friendly way to download and track my sales and expenses other than getting sales and fee figures from eBay Sales Reports and then getting refund and shipping figures from Paypal? Isn't there an almighty report that shows everything?

Ebay,DEFECT RATE: WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW,"Ok, let me preface by saying that I will still be a TRS in August. I am at a 1.93% defect rate. MOST of my defects are from things that had literally nothing to do with me. I'll give two examples.

I explained to her that she did in fact receive the correct model and once she realized that all was well. The case was never escalated, nothing more came of it. That's a defect.

I sold an item and the buyer did not put his box number on the address, it was rejected by his university and sent back to me. He opened a case saying he did not receive the item. I refunded in full immediately after I received it. HE forgot to put his box on the label, I am at fault. That's a defect.

Ebay,I am having a lot of trouble with eBay/PayPal postage and shipping. I end up owing more or my buyer owes postage.,"I'm a relatively new seller to eBay but I have very established account (since 2000) and have sold in the past with no problems. I sell clothes and shoes.

So, in the past few instances I have listed auctions and eBay suggests I use a ""Expedited Shipping/Priority Mail Envelope"" for the transaction. Say, for a pair of athletic clothes. I trust eBay's judgment and go ahead and do so. Auction is won, I go to the post office, find a Priority Mail envelope and tape the shipping label to it.  The lines were literally out the door, and if I waited it would have been hours. So, I ship it off assuming the postage is correct. (It was $5.60.) Then the buyer complains that she had to pay an ADDITIONAL .85 cents at the door. (I refunded her with PayPal, no questions asked)

I'm pissed at the post office that they make it so damn difficult to get anything done because they're hardly staffed... I could go on and on. She's already spending $6 on shipping something that's light weight by most standards, come on!

But above all, I'm confused. I have ran into this problem before where I actually had to cover the postage because I usually always check with a mail clerk before I ship something off. And she'll tell me I owe 80 cents or so probably because ""the tape put it over the limit"".

I'm already losing money to PayPal/eBay in fees and on top of it I'm paying out of pocket or getting feedback about this on my page because my buyer had to pay  at the door. 

I need a better shipping system that will ensure this will never happen again. I would seriously appreciate some advice on this.  I don't want to quit eBay yet because it's been good to have extra spending money, but the stress of the shipping problem/post office is starting to make it not worth it. I hope this isn't taken as a rant, I need some direction/guidance and it's obvious I'm new to the selling world.

Thank you!

**tl;dr eBay suggests shipping postage for me based on my listing and I accept their judgment, then later find out I owe or my buyer owes for the postage beyond what was already paid on the label. And it's already fairly expensive, leading to unhappy buyers and unhappy me. What is the best, fastest, cheapest way to ship clothes when Priority Mail envelopes are costing us an arm and a leg?**

Ebay,Minor ebay issue - received unfair negative feedback,"I've just received negative feedback from a lady that hasn't paid. Yup.

She ordered a game and asked to do pickup, I told her that we don't do pickup, for a few reasons but including convenience and security. 

Obviously those reasons weren't good enough for her. Of course she couldn't understand what I meant about convenience. I was referring to my convenience, which was obviously too complicated a concept for her to grasp. 

Anyhow, she pointed out that it didn't say no pick ups in the item description. 

I did have it clearly stated in all item descriptions that I don't offer pickups but I recently deleted that line as I felt it a little patronising - and I didn't feel it required to state it. I removed some other lines such as we only receive paypal so please don't ask for my bank account details, and a line about not asking for a reduction in postage costs. 

I've put the line back in about no pickups following this situation. 

Anyhow, she's not paid, and I hope she doesn't - but I got my first negative today, which was nice. Apparently I'm the rudest person on ebay, which I imagine is quite an achievement should it be verified. 

I've sent an email message via the contact ebay system as she perhaps purposefully waited until the point that they closed for the day / long weekend. 

I responded to her negative feedback. And I also left her feedback as a buyer (I clicked positive but left something negative - which I think she'll find difficult to remove - ha!)

This negative comment will get removed right?

Also, side question - are there any repercussions from posting negative feedback about buyers.  I did the other day with another non paying customer.

Ebay,"I thought this was fishy, am I wrong in thinking this? Am I just over-thinking things?","So I recently placed a bid on an item that I was interested in buying. Someone else outbid me and I decided to wait until it was closer to the deadline to try and outbid. Me and the other user got in a bid war and he ended up winning, and payed what seemed like way more than the item was worth. Right after I lost the seller contacted me with a ""2nd chance"" offer to buy it now for my highest bid price. 

Now I will admit I got caught in the moment a little, but I found this very fishy. To start with this is a hard to find item, and suddenly the seller has 2. My highest bid was 55 dollars, and I was outbid, while I know for a fact the exact same item failed to sell a week ago for 20 dollars (hence me getting caught in the moment and bidding more than I should). This item is rare, but it is not that valuable, I think 20 dollars is a more than fair price.

So here's what I feel like happened. I feel like the seller was bidding me up to see how high I would go, and then offer me the item as a buy it now for  the highest price I was willing to pay. He wouldn't have to worry about losing his item for 20 dollars if nobody bid, and he would find out the maximum value I would pay before relisting it for that exact value.

Maybe I am overthinking things and he just had a 2nd copy, but I also noticed that 10 minutes after he listed the buy it now item it had 5 people watching it. There weren't even 5 people bidding on the last item, just me and one other person. Could he be using bots to make it look like a lot of people are interested?

I don't like being scammed and to me this feels like a scam. I figured I would post here and get your guys thoughts though.

Ebay,"Trying to be a fair seller, but buyers purchase at their own risk, what do you think?","I listed an Apple Brand Adapter Converter For iPhone 5 5S 5C Apple Lightning 8 Pin to 30 Pin Dock Cable, and described it as brand new, unused, but without original packaging, and no returns - I bought it at Apple but it had the wrong docks for what I thought I needed. 

A seller purchased it and said he got a ""cable is not recognized/supported"" error message when trying to connect it to his Apple devices. And opened up a case stating the ""item was not as described"" and wants a full refund including the cost of his shipping it back to me (he bought it with free shipping for $16). His main argument is that because it does not work for his products, it is either counterfeit (despite it clearly stating on the item it is an Apple, Inc. product) or faulty and that he was clearly duped. 

However, a quick google search finds that there are SEVERAL reviews on the Apple Store, Amazon, and Apple Support communities that states this is a COMMON issue of hit-or-miss with this particular Apple product with other Apple devices. Here are links:

In my personal opinion, it's up to the buyer to do their research on any potential purchase drawbacks, am I being too rigid here?

Ebay,Ebay stated reasons why you can't have negative feedback removed.,"I had an ebay negative feedback issue which was discussed in another thread which has now been updated. I thought it would be good to create a new thread because personally I think what I have learned is very important. 

This is what I was told, which I found interesting and is probably good to put in the collective ebay memory banks...

The negative feedback could be removed because...it made reference to not allowing pick up (which i'm not obliged to offer). 

However, because there was an OPINION BASED comment in the negative feedback (I'm a rude seller) the customer service rep could not remove the feedback without referal to a manager - as opinion based negative feedback is not allowed to be removed. Therefore, if the negative feedback was simply - a very rude seller - then I would not have been allowed to remove the feedback. Jaw drops. 

I also asked if the fact that she hadn't paid had any bearing. 

I got a bit of a non answer - kind of yes, kind of no. In his explanation the ebay rep said that the buyer had the INTENTION of paying. 

I got really annoyed by that. How the heck does he know what her intention is. Further, in the messages she clearly states that she has no intention of paying the amount including postage. That she only intends on paying the amount not including postage. 

I asked to be put through a manager but I gave up because it's not fair on myself to put myself through the pain of having to deal with them. 

So I'll make my comment here. 

Can ebay please wake up and realise that 

a) allowing the non removal of opinion based negative feedback is not good enough

b) your staff do not know the intentions of your customers. And even if they did, their intentions come second to their actions. 

c) non payment should lead to immediate removal of any negative feedback regardless as to the reasons for the feedback. 

As it stands, any seller can be subject to opinion based negative feedback from non paying buyers and you will have ZERO chance of having it removed. 

That's pretty significant. 

Ahole buyers should be aware of this - this is all they need to do to destroy someones business. 

Buy an item. Don't pay. Leave an opinion based negative feedback. Repeat.",34,7,2014-04-21,EBAY,0.21230928599834442,0.7639329433441162,0.023757748305797577

Ebay,Shipping Problem with an Auction that I Won,"I won an auction last Monday (4/14/2014) for a vaporizer. I paid within 5 minutes through my PayPal balance. The listing had 5 pictures of the items (vaporizer + kit). Seller looks to be reputable with at least 150 transactions. Although only 3 were in the past 12 months and most being in the 2006-2008 range with a few scattered here and there until now. 

On Wednesday (4/16/2014), the seller sent me a message saying he was at a location 450 miles away from item location (about 6h, 30min via driving) to help with some family issues. He added that his wife could package it and ship it to me but he wanted to clean the an item in the kit before it sent it to me. His wife couldn't do it, because she would not know how and he would be driving home on Friday and would clean it up/box it up and ship it first thing Monday morning.

To me, that's perfectly reasonable. Cleaning a part for this vaporizer would be a smart idea before shipping it across the country. I responded a few hours later saying that I intended on cleaning it anyways and that I would prefer to have it shipped sooner rather and if it was fine with him to have it shipped asap, but if not then I could wait until Monday.

It has been a few days since, but I have not received any messages from him. I sent him another message last Saturday (04/19/2014) asking for confirmation of the item being shipping on Monday and if I would be receiving a tracking ID (the item was listed with Free Expedited Shipping).

Now my question is what should my plan of attack be? I think waiting a week for an item to be shipped is bullshit, but I understand if there were family issues. I'm just a bit upset at the lack of communication or the prepartion of the item before it was supposed to be shipped.  I've never had to file a complaint on an item before, but should I do that on eBay after Monday morning if I don't get a Tracking ID? Or do you have any other suggestions? I don't ever bid on auctions on eBay and this is my first so I don't know how things work.

Ebay,Should I escalate a dispute through paypal? Feel like buyer is trying to scam.,"Sold an iphone that strictly said it was on Verizon with a bad ESN. A person purchased it on February 26. He just now opened a case, however this case was opened in Paypal and not through ebay. He opened the case with the message of spilled coffee and no sim card slot and with that, he cousin in the Ukraine is unable to use it. He also has very broken english and he does indeed purchase several phones with bad ESN's when looking at his feedback history.

Things that make me feel like I'm being scammed:

I feel like this guy is attempting to scam me out of an item I sold on ebay. I listed all the relevant information on Ebay and he is opening up a case in paypal. Here are some things that is making me think that he's attempting to scam. 

1) item was purchased and shipped to a United States address. Also Ukraine is not on my list of available places to ship. I feel like it's not my fault that phone doesn't work in the Ukraine.

2) I strictly stated that the item was on the Verizon network with a bad ESN

3) He apparently did not ""look"" at it before shipping it to his ""cousin"" in the Ukraine.

4) Looking at his ebay purchases, he purchases a lot of iphones with bad ESN's.

5) His spelling of ""coffee"" in his original dispute is spelled ""kofe"" and he has broken english which makes it seems like the address he has listed on ebay is probably a forwarding address.

6) If it's not a forwarding address then he did not look at the phone before shipping it to his ""cousin"" is a bit odd

7) He also claims spilled coffee caused internal damage. I for one don't drink coffee. I hate it. Plus if there were any spilled liquids on the inside of the item then the entire item would be broken and not function at all which is not what he his claiming.

8) He is opening this case through Paypal and not Ebay where the item was purchased.

9) The item was sold and paid for on March 18. He just opened this case on the 19th of April.

10) I know there is ebay buyer protection, however the phone is exactly what was listed and is 100% as described.",6,2,2014-04-21,EBAY,0.16349349915981293,0.8138701915740967,0.02263631671667099

I figure that's just ebay, you don't buy used stuff expecting it to be in brand new condition, and sellers can't catch every single issue.

Ebay,Automatically relist this item up to 3 times if it doesn't sell - Not quite working,"I have around 200 listings and most were renewing this afternoon.

Almost all of the listings have automatically re-listed as expected, but around 20 haven't. 

I still have included listings for the month so I'm not concerned about the loss - but want to make sure I understand what's going on for moving forward. I am expecting that I'll be able to get around 5-600 concurrent listings by using the relisting up to 3 times (3 months) option. 

With the ones that didn't automatically re-list, I've edited them and found that some of them had the option already ticked. So I'm wondering why they didn't re-list. 

Some of them didn't give me / show me the option which I thought was a little strange. 

Maybe it's just an anomaly which won't add up to much - but hopefully i'll be able to figure out what's going on as having items which should re-list not re-list isn't ideal.

Ebay,"First time selling on ebay, looking to sell a CPU.

Currently testing out the waters and ebay's system recommends putting it auction style but from what I've read on the net from other forums, a

Ebay,Buyer from Russia issuing threats unless I pay return shipping because he doesn't like the color.,"I sold a new with tags sports coat to a gentleman in Russia. I referred to the jacket as ""Attractive Neutral Color,"" and posted the sizing information from the tags. Today I woke up to two grumpy messages from this guy, who seems to be unhappy with the item due to it's color, saying I'm trying to rip him off, trick him intentionally yada yada. I have never had an issue with anyone having problems with my photographs, and this would be my potential first negative feedback in some 200+ deals. 

Here are the two messages: 
""Full color discrepancy on your photo dark brown jacket, I sent you a little gray. I would not buy it if you posted the normal photos and specify the correct color. I want a full refund, return freight you pay for. If you are not satisfied, I will leave a negative review about the deception and open debate especially since you tricked me.""

and 

""Size 48 is not that you have specified, the minimum size of the jacket 52. You are all so deceiving? Bring back my money!""


The jacket is a size 48 as specified on the tag that is attached to the darn thing, I never stated a color as to my eye it sat somewhere between gray and brown, instead I took the full 12 pictures, many zoomed in to best demonstrate the color.


Am I completely screwed here? Am I going to have to pay for shipping half way across the world because this guy has buyers remorse? What should my action be from here? Am I ridiculous to offer to accept the return if he pays return shipment, as I did nothing to misrepresent the item and he is unhappy.

Ebay,Why you should consider not opting-in for the new returns policy (specifically UK) - Why I won't be signing up.,"Recently I saw a lot of posts saying that people will opt-in to the new returns policy on ebay and the advantages it gives you with regards to TRS (no stupid cases about INAD when someone just wants to return something through remorse affecting your defect rate) and obviously this is an advantage.


However, looking at the policy yesterday I can see the returns process is horrendous, at least for the UK. 
Basically ebay has teamed up with collect+, we already knew this from a few months ago when they started offering it automatically to casual sellers.
As far as i'm aware when a buyer wants to return something under new policy they will select whether it's remorse or INAD. Some people are honest but I think it's fairly obvious that often out of embarrassment or another similar reason, at least a certain percentage of buyers choose to nitpick a fault even if it's not there,  blaming the return on you rather than themselves.


Here is where the fun starts.


When the buyer chooses INAD return, they will print a label from collect+ which will be added on to your invoice at the end of the month, forcing you to pay the return shipping based on what the buyer claimed. If this wasn't bad enough already, if you are selling low weight items such as video games, jewellery, phone cases, phones, ipods, etc. The postage cost for economy is £4.89 which is over double the price of royal mail. 

As a business seller, when a mistake is made by yourself then obviously pay for the buyers return postage, this is not really even debatable. But when the buyer makes the mistake and blames you, you are now forced to pay the costs which is bad, making you pay for collect+ is now twice as bad because it's double the price and you don't get a choice about it.


So overall it just comes down to a cost-benefit analysis of the entire situation. We are already aware that TRS now requires luck as well as skill once the defect rate is applied and if you are unlucky enough to have a few scammers or crazy buyers this can now tip you over the edge as the rates i've seen the best sellers post are in the 1.5-1.7% region, with most being around 1.8%-2.2%.
With this in mind it seems taking returns as you normally were will save you a lot of money in the UK especially if you are over the 2% to begin with. 


TL;DR: Ebay forcing you to use collect+ and paying for the buyers return postage costs is basically a mafia style move into making you pay more, especially when royal mail is half price and a more well known service.",9,3,2014-04-25,EBAY,0.056366343051195145,0.9133033156394958,0.03033032827079296
Ebay,"Did anyone else get this email from ebay? ""a special protection for sellers evaluated on the last 12 months transactions""","Is this something all 'non-top sellers' are getting or did I do something wrong?

""As we approach the August 20 evaluation date when the new seller performance standards take effect, we're writing to let you know about a special protection in place for sellers like you who are evaluated on your transactions over the past 12 months. The protection is designed to ensure your selling is not restricted due to defects acquired prior to March 11, 2014, before we first announced they would be counted.

You'll be protected through the March 20, 2015 seller evaluation from selling limits or restrictions as a consequence of falling below eBay's minimum standards strictly because of one or more of the defects that were not previously counted in standards that you received prior to March 11, 2014: opened cases, detailed seller ratings of 3 for item description, returns because the item was not as described, negative or neutral feedback, or seller-cancelled transactions*.

Note this special protection is designed to protect you from the consequences of falling below eBay's minimum standards. It does not apply to Top Rated Seller status and benefits or prevent your listings from being lowered in search. But it will give you extra time to continue selling and meet the new minimum standards. 

Once the new seller performance standards go into effect, we will send you a notification when this protection is applied to your account.

Ebay,I'm a seller and I'm worried about buyer trying to file a claim... plz help answer this if you can,"OK so heres the deal, I have a 32in Vizio 3D internet TV and last night it started freezing and rebooting while watching netflix, worked fine watching TV but the apps gave me issues. So i decided to just sell the thing since I never really used it and my brother's gf moved in and she brought a tv with her. I've been watching it all day today and using netflix and have had no issues.

so I posted a listing on ebay, stating in the description that it froze a couple of times and it rebooted using the apps but from what I know everything else works. then someone messages me they would buy it now for the price i had if i gave free shipping, but to use bill me later. I don't know how to do that so i just posted another listing for buy it now with free shipping but this time I stated in the title ""AS-IS"" and still listed as used. another buyer, not the one who messaged me, bought it and paid. 

My question is could either of the buyers file a claim if the issue returns even though I clearly stated it has froze/rebooted a couple of times? and Am I more covered going with the listing where I state AS-IS in the title and description vs the listing that just mentions the issues im having and not the actual ""AS-IS"" specific???

""A transaction is a purchase from a listing. If a buyer purchases two or more identical items from the same multi-quantity listing, or purchases the same items in different variations such as color or size from the same multi-variation listing, that is considered one transaction. If a buyer purchases items from four different listings from the same seller and combines them into one order, that would be counted as four transactions.

Ebay,"Think I just got my first ""bad"" bidder. :( Not so much bad as... he's a freakin' moron","I'm sure tons of people here have had the experience before, but it's a first, for me.  I've had items sell for *way* less than I had in them, of course, and I've had items that just wouldn't sell, no matter what, but I've never had an actual *bad* bidder.

I had this extra bicycle engine kit (because I once thought it'd be fun to build *lots* of them... lol) so I finally put it up for sale on eBay.  Starting bid @ $100, blah blah, you know how it goes, lots of views, a few watchers, last minute bidding.  The winning bid came in close to the end, too - just $105.50.  Ah well, at least I'm getting some cash back out of something that's wasting space in the closet... right?  30 seconds after he wins the bid, he starts emailing with questions: what kind of bikes will this fit?  etc, etc.  ""Oh, no, I have a mountain bike I wanted to put it on!""....

Jeez.  A moron bidded on it.  I could have done without the additional buck if it meant doing without his bid.

He was responding really quickly up until after his ""oh, but I have a mountain bike.  What shall we do?""  As if I'm supposed to be a part of his problem, at this point.  He could have asked all the questions he wanted to, before the end of auction.  

So I finally took a look at his eBay profile.  Just 10 days old... and a big 0 (zero).  I never blocked the zeros before... I was one once, myself, and you've gotta have the chance to start.

But...

Yeah.  The morons are out there.   They're pounding at the doors, demanding to be let in, so they can demand to be let out because all the other morons made it crowded, then demanding to be let back in because they got lonely and cold... *sigh*.

And I thought dogs were kinda dumb... but this guy takes the cake.

I suppose I'll be adding that text to my sales, next: ""Bidders with under 10 feedback contact me before bidding.""  And I really didn't think there were people capable of using eBay &amp; PayPal who were too stupid to realize that the engine for a bicycle fits into that big triangular space that the frame makes.

Scam?,"I have a buyer who just bought a piece of audio equipment for $280 on the 26th, and the next day he told me that if I thought that it might not get to him by the 1st to wait until around the 8th to ship it (so it would arrive on the 12th). His excuse is that he'll be on vacation. Is this some sort of scam that people pull often? I can't see it being that way, but it could be a trickier one. Any ideas? He has already paid me and I still have the item, so I am not worried about that.",15,3,2014-04-30,EBAY,0.04213626682758331,0.8992952108383179,0.05856848508119583

Ebay,Packaged shipped ten days ago?,"I ordered a package ten days ago from someone in New York. The estimated delivery date was Thursday the 24th. He shipped it that same day. Now, I live in North Carolina. Not extremely far from NY. The tracking says it left at a city five hours from here on the 26th. Four days ago. There has been no update since.

Ebay,Questions about shipping internationally with DHL,"I have been selling on ebay for a few years but only in the US with USPS.  I want to expand internationally to increase my revenue.  
I have my own DHL account that is set at a deeply discounted rate. As such I would like to stay away from the GSP through eBay so I can keep the shipping cost low for my buyers.  
I have always generated the shipment through eBay with the USPS. If I want to ship something with DHL I would have to generate the shipment on another website to get my discount.  
So here are my questions.  
  
1. Is this possible? (I see no DHL option for shipping on eBay)
  
2. If it is, will eBay recognize that the tracking number that DHL provides (on the other website) will be for that particular item sold on eBay?  
3. Is there another way to ship with my own DHL account though eBay to use my discounted shipping rates?

I have called and talked to eBay about this but after about an hour on the phone I was more confused than when I started.",2,1,2014-04-30,EBAY,0.020615532994270325,0.9318421483039856,0.047542303800582886

Ebay,Question about paying: a first time user of eBay that doesn't wanna use PayPal,"So, there's an item I want to get on ebay, right? At a really great price, right? So I wanna get it. But... how exactly does paying for it work when you don't want to use PayPal, but the seller has it as ""PayPal preferred""?

Can I still pay through a straight out visa credit card (like Amazon)?
Or is a PayPal account mandatory for eBay transactions that are ""paypal preferred""?


I'm not necessarily worried about the seller, because they seem like a very reliable one. What I'm not too sure about is making a paypal account that I would be rarely using. I don't wanna go on eBaysucks subreddit because I'll be getting a very biased opinion from there, but I do want to fully understand what getting a Paypal account means. I mean, it's relatively straightforward with amazon: give us your credit card number, information, and billing address, and we'll send your stuff to you. Why doesn't ebay have something like that, and instead depend on a middleman? 

The fewer exchanges my money makes, the better I can sleep at night. What are your thoughts in regards to my situation, to the nature of Paypal, and to my paranoia towards Paypal compared to my more confident outlook on amazon?",9,0,2014-04-30,EBAY,0.02689403109252453,0.934406042098999,0.038699954748153687
