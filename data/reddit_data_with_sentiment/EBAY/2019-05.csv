Ebay,Experience with dodgy ebay manufacturer warranties?,"Hey, I bought a bike shelter from ebay. The seller claims to be an Australian business, and the item cost about the same as one from the UK with good reviews. However when it arrived it's clear that it's a Chinese reseller and the actual item is very unlikely going to last the first storm. The listing specifically mentioned a 2 year manufacturers warranty, which made up (alongside the 'Australian Company' part of the profile) a big portion of my decision to purchase from them. Admittedly I should have investigated further. I've asked the seller for details of the manufacturers warranty and they said they'll get back to me (which I very much doubt). If they don't get back to me with proper details, I would regard this as item not as described and ask for a refund through paypal. I don't really expect the seller or manufacturer to honour this warranty, however I bought this with Amex and Amex only honour manufacturers warranties. If it turns out to be total bollocks (which is looking likely) then they won't honour it.

I don't really want to send this back and I reckon I can reinforce the whole thing by bolting it down, waterproofing the tarp and treating the metal with anti rust etc, but I'm only willing to do that with the warranty.

Anyone had experience with ebay and people listing 'Full warranty' or anything like that when it's not the case? Would I be eligible for a refund in this case?",4,3,2019-05-01,EBAY,0.04658845067024231,0.9132804870605469,0.040131088346242905

Ebay,New Mandatory Sales Tax Questions,"I am a re-seller, and I buy lots of items. I was going to check out for a couple of things this morning, and I realized that there was a sales tax added. I live in New Jersey, and I noticed that starting today, there will be a tax added to items shipped here.

My questions are:

1. Does the tax money go to the seller? 
2. When I sell something, will a tax automatically be added to the buyer's cost?
3. Is this tax mainly for the state that the item is sold in, or being sent to?

Ebay,Is it wrong of me for not wanting to tell the buyer how much I paid for an item they bought?,"(UK seller, first time posting on Reddit)

Recently had a listing of a signed album which sold almost instantly. 

The buyer’s first question after paying was for an invoice from where it was bought (obviously to make sure it was genuine, which I can’t argue with), with which I provided an invoice. 

Though, I did blank out information such as my surname, order number and how much I paid for them (idk I felt like I didn’t want to share that, is that wrong?)

They asked why it didn’t have the price. They then continued to send another question saying that they saw it cheaper somewhere else. 

In my head I’m thinking ‘why are they even asking me this? what’s the price of someone else’s listing got to do with me?’ but obviously, I don’t want to unnecessarily be mean. So I say I chose that price because I checked what other items of that nature were going for and that I also was considering the amount of shipping I spent on the item. 

I’d already sent off the item at this point, so I said if they wished to return the item then they would have to wait until the item arrived and open a return case with eBay and that we can resolve it as quickly as possible.

They replied, ‘no I’ll keep it thanks,” so I’m like ok, they’ve stopped asking questions now, so I’ll give them some advice. I told them to keep an eye out on a certain website for signed albums so that they don’t have to pay for resale value in the future, which I thought was helpful. 

They replied along the lines of ‘wow ok thanks for the advice, I know I’ve been annoying lol’ 

Thought it was over and I woke up this morning with another message why it didn’t have the prices on the invoice. 

Ugh. Is this a genuine buyer or am I just getting annoyed for no reason?

Am I wrong for not sharing the price of the item, when it’s much cheaper than if he were to buy it from America? 

Help. I really wanted to be helpful but they won’t stop messaging me after I’ve already sent the item!!




UPDATE: 

I replied back, ‘I’m sorry but I didn’t want to disclose that information, nor am I obliged to,’ and to next time consider messaging before purchasing. 

He said he was sorry because he was scammed recently but that he believed my album was genuine, and that he didn’t know repeatedly asking was making me uncomfortable. 

I’m still unsure.",36,26,2019-05-02,EBAY,0.057054389268159866,0.9006604552268982,0.04228515550494194
Ebay,Alternative to PayPal? New massive PayPal refunding fees introduced.,"*""PayPal has said that anyone who disagrees with any of their new terms is free to close their account.""*

So i'm looking to do this because of their new slap in the face to sellers.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're unaware, this is what was just introduced:

&amp;#x200B;

*""Anyone selling goods via PayPal pays 2.9% commission on the sale, which will no longer be returned when giving a full or partial refund. The flat fee is set at $0.30, and has never been subject to refunds.*

*People are angry about the changes, and have been quick to point out what it means in practice. If a vendor sells something for $1,000, but the customer changes their mind, the seller has not only lost their buyer, they will have also lost $29 in the process.""*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using ebay from Canada, I just heard about the new PayPal ridiculousness where if a customer submits and cancels an order like people do constantly on ebay, than the seller is on the hook for paypals side of the fees anyway even though no money is coming in, the seller has to pay the fees as if it just sold to PayPal.

Obviously this is ridiculous and i'm not interested in taking a large hit every time someone decides to submit then cancel and order, which we all know happens a lot on ebay.

Is there an alternative I can set up so that I can sell on ebay without that PayPal ridiculousness? I'm not interested in leaving myself open to such hits as losing $30 because someone cancels on a $999 item.",27,10,2019-05-02,EBAY,0.1575351357460022,0.8192102313041687,0.023254670202732086

Ebay,Buyer had credit card company reverse transaction,"Hello, looking for some assistance or recommendations on how to resolve a problem. 

I sold a Rolex on eBay in January, payment thru PayPal. No issues reported from buyer. 2 months later, after timeframe to open a dispute in eBay or PayPal had expired, the seller reached out to his credit card company and disputed the charges, indicating the item “was not as described”. The financial institution reversed the charges, as did PayPal. PayPal opened a dispute, requesting bank to return payment. The financial institution did not, and PayPal subsequently has told me I owe the funds for a refund. 

Buyer did not return the watch, and because eBay lists the item as being purchased, they cannot do anything. PayPal has submitted me to collection agency for non-payment. 

Anyone have a similar experience? Anyone able to resolve the issue? To me the buyer found a loophole and has left me with the loss.

Ebay,Advice for a Novice seller?,"I have a buyer playing games with me and I feel like I'm stuck and EBAY isn't going to help.  I'm moving and I sold my old DVDs on EBAY.  There were 172 split between 3 lots, that is I had 3 different sales, each a box of DVDs.  At the last minute a single buyer swooped in and bought all 3.  I grossed $72, and after shipping, netted $40.  

Now that all 3 are received, I got a notification that the seller wants to refund on one of the three items (naturally the most expensive) Indicating:

&gt; Info from the buyer
&gt; 
&gt;Reason
&gt; 
&gt; Doesn't work or defective

&gt; Comments

&gt; Rental stickers on paper snap cases, slim cases Mexican titles, sticker on lenticular cover, **deep scratches**. Wish to return the damaged for replacement.

There were 172 DVDs sold as a lot.  I'm fairly certain there was no damage.  But who knows maybe 1 or 2 were scratched.  So I communicated with a buyer and offered to do a partial refund, and I need a count of damaged DVDs.  The buyer won't give me a count.  They appear to be waiting for the 6 days to elapse so that dispute will be escalated.  I suppose I'm lucky the buyer isn't doing all 3 boxes and is only returning one.  I did mark the sale ""No returns"" but apparently that's meaningless if the buyer claims damage.

The buyer is a reseller.   They are buying used DVDs and selling them on EBAY.  Currently listing over 500 items.   I believe they bought my DVDs intending to resell them, but after receiving them they realized only half were worth reselling.  The DVD titles were all visible in the listing picture, but the buyer didn't take the time to look at what was for sale before bidding/buying.   So now they are fabricating ""Damage"" and I will get stuck with another shipping bill and a box of DVDs that aren't worth reselling.

QUESTION: 

1. How does this end, assuming I made an honest effort to give a partial refund.  Refuse to do a full refund, and dispute the REFUND with EBAY.  And discussions with the buyer hint that the real issue is they cannot resell some of the titles.
2. Does EBAY seller protection help me in any way here?
3. Assuming the buyer does end up returning all three, what's my best course of action?  How can I make things more difficult for the buyer.  To keep up appearances, the buyer will have to scratch the DVDs.  If they ship me bricks, I'm stuck.
4.  Is it worth it to dispute this with EBAY?  If the buyer/seller communication hint at the reason for the return has more to do with resale value than with actual damage?
5. How long does the buyer have to request a refund and have it work?  How long do I have to worry about the other two boxes being returned.

Ebay,Why are people so concerned about sniping?,"I've used ebay here and there and I see many posts complaining about the issue of sniping. However I don't see the reason behind all the frustration. Sniping at the last 50 seconds is no different than ""sniping"" in the first seconds of the listing. 

Example: I'm currently bidding on something I want (about 1 day left to go). I bid the item at $100, and I'm currently the high bidder at $39. No one knows what my maximum bid is. It could be $500 for all they know. So with a minute left, and a sniper comes along. He wants to snipe this auction. It's at $39 but what will he snipe with? If he snipes at $50 he will lose. If he snipes again at $60 he will lose. With only 50 seconds left he can't snipe more than two or three times. Since he clearly has no idea what my maximum bid is, he can either lose, or bid up to my maximum. 

Let'say the sniper comes in and snipes it at $150. Well, he'll win the auction at $101. But what's the point of sniping if he can just start the auction by bidding $150? If he did that, he would have been high bidder at $39, and when I bid $100, I will be outbid to $101. 

Same outcome.",33,13,2019-05-05,EBAY,0.04754715412855148,0.9139171838760376,0.03853562846779823

Ebay,What’s up with PayPal credit? 24 0% financing... what’s in it for them?,"I’m buying a new computer and saw the “pay $X for 24 months with PayPal credit” link so I checked it out.

So I applied and was instant approved for $7,000. Not bad. 

I just don’t understand what’s in it for them? Are they just banking on people not paying it off on time to grab the interest charges? 24 months is a long time to wait to make any money and they have to front these purchases until then. 6 months I’d understand, but 2 YEARS seems awfully generous.

Ebay,Ebay changed my international shipping policy without my knowledge!,"I was looking at one of my listings after posting, and saw the ""Shipping to:"" section on the ""Shipping and payments"" tab showed EVERY COUNTRY!

This was alarming as our shipping policy was originally set to ONLY the contiguous USA (no AK HI or APO/FPO). What happened?

I looked at our other listings, even our oldest ones, and every one offered international shipping!

I went into our business policies dashboard to see what happened, and it turns out ebay automatically changed our preferences WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE! The ""Global Shipping Program"" had a checked box that would allow international sales sent to a US shipping center.

NOT COOL EBAY.

I unchecked the box and tried to save the policy, and ebay warned me that it would affect the 131 listings and templates currently using the shipping policy. ""Oh it will? Good!"" It would have been nice to get that warning when the policy got changed in the first place!

Now this might not affect a lot of sellers, but some of us refuse to deal with the hassles of international shipping (including the cost of returns and the struggles with INR cases) so we set a specific area we ship to that excludes other countries.

If someone who offers FREE returns suddenly had international shipping added without their consent, can you imagine the potential backlash?

Ebay,Feels Like a Crazy VeRO Claim - Losing It a Little,"I got my first VeRO after a few years of selling, and while I should consider myself lucky to have made it this long, this one seems nuts. I was selling a diecast toy police car from the 90s and got a VeRO. Not from the maker, but from the former police officers association for that state claiming that it was counterfeit and a trademark violation for using their logo. 

I didn't use the logo in the listing. I just literally had the most basic [State] &amp; Police as part of the listing and my own pictures of the car. I contacted the rights holder noting that it was authentic and legit, just old, and they're sticking by it saying that they don't care because they own the logo now. They care so much that they couldn't even be bothered to have a participant profile on the VeRO page.

Ebay,"""Guaranteed delivery by...""","I'm sure people know of the new thing happening on the 'Bay where delivery, as the title says, is guaranteed by a certain date or you get some kind of voucher for a future purchase. I have some questions about this that I was wondering if someone could answer.

1. Who provides the funds for the voucher--eBay or the seller?

2. Does eBay notify or penalize the seller in any way if a buyer reports a delivery did not arrive by the ""guaranteed"" delivery date?

3. My understanding is this program provides a voucher in the amount of the shipping costs should a late delivery be reported. What does eBay do in cases where the shipping method selected was ""fast 'n free""?

4. If the item(s) you've purchased end up somehow getting lost/stolen in shipment, does reporting a late delivery through this program surrender your right to file an INR claim with eBay and/or an insurance claim with the shipping company?

I can't find any good information to answer these questions, nor have I ever used this program, so I'm reaching out to see if anyone knows before I use it for my first time. I'd be using it based on something that looks to be 100% a postal issue and not the fault of the seller (postal goons didn't scan the item initially so there's no scheduled delivery date, our daily mail delivery has already happened, and our letter carrier says he has no packages for me today), so I want to make sure this doesn't hurt the seller before I tell eBay the item will not be arriving on the guaranteed date.

Ebay,Ordered a SNES. It was broken when arrived. Sent it back and seller refused to refund me. Was I right to open a case with ebay?,"So I ordered a snes on eBay. Cost me £50. In the listing it was described as fully working and great condition. When it arrived I realised it wasn't an authentic snes, it was a cheap fake. I decided that if it worked okay I would keep it anyway so I get to work setting it up to discover that the connections had melted plastic stuck in them so I couldn't actually connect the wires to the console. Also some of the prongs were bent so I couldn't actually fit the wires into the input. 

Anyway, I sent the seller an email explaining what was wrong and he said to send pictures to prove it so I did. He said 'I can see the damage and it must have happened in transit, please return for a full refund' so I sent it back to him at my own expense reordered delivery. However, once he had got the console he emailed me and said he can see that I damaged the console so therefore would not be refunding me. 

I then opened a case with ebay, I sent them all the pictures I had taken. They sided with me and refunded me. Once I had won the case, the seller kept emailing me trying to make me feel guilty saying I had took money away from his children, and basically harassing me.

Ebay,Advice on a very awkward buyer.,"Hi

I’m looking for some advice on how to deal with a situation. 

I listed a keyboard about a month ago for around £60 at the starting bidding and £130 BIN (I also want to add that I selected no refunds when I listed it). I included numerous photos including the box, keyboard, switches etc. I was quite shocked to find out someone payed the BIN since I just added that as a Hail Mary. I messaged him and offered to chuck some keycaps in as well and he seemed happy about that. I posted it off and though all was well.

He had payed up and PayPal slapped a hold on the funds but I just presume that was precautionary since this was slightly different compared to my usual selling patterns. I received a return request about a week later saying “I received the wrong item and want a refund” I replied asking what was wrong and called eBay and they recommend asking for photo evidence - which I did as well. I waited a few days and heard no response so I sent him a pm asking for a reply and still heard no further response. I called eBay again and they said there isn’t much that they can do and recommended waiting until they can escalate the case.  

So I waited and escalated the case a couple of days ago and today found out that eBay has put a hold of £130 on my paypal account and asked the buyer to send the keyboard back to me. In my eyes this is a complete joke. When I escalated the case I expected them to reach out to the buyer and ask him to provided some proof - or just end the case. Not give the buyer exactly what he wanted. I called eBay and felt like I was going round in circles. They didn’t provide any more information and just told me to wait for the keyboard to return. They would not even tell me what would happen if I received the exactly same, functioning product back.

Ebay,Question about selling an expensive electronic,"I have an account that is pretty reputable. I sell mostly things in the range of $10-$30 and then sprinkles of items upward. I have sold an item or two at $1000 and they have gone without a problem. 

I don’t deal much with electronics. But I have an item that sells for 3k. My trepidation is knowing electronics seem to have more scammers than other categories. That’s my assumption of course. And really because this is just one item and nothing I’m replenishing, I want to take as much precaution as possible. As a seller. What is the best way to protect myself against someone claiming something? The item is brand new and never opened or touched. I’m worried about someone claiming damage or not working or different than advertised. Or a chargeback for that matter.  Or even non delivery. I know I can do registered mail. Have them sign. Insurance etc. I’m not sure that is fool proof enough to make sure I have all my t’s crossed and I’d dotted. Any suggestions on the best way to do this? Or is it a crap shoot in the end regardless of how much I protect myself?

Ebay,A Different eBay is A Challenge Post?,"I've read hundreds of posts about sales dying, competition, manipulation, etc. I'm not here to complain or whine. I've experimented with listing daily, promoted listings, sales, auction v BO, etc. I've read tons of blogs and articles. So I have done my due diligence and am not coming here to be lazy or find a quick fix. 

What I'm looking for are success stories. How have you managed to turn sales around? I have been selling for 20 years. My most accessible line to source, due to my location, working full-time, and my knowledge, is one of the most crowded segments, clothing and accessories. I am very selective in what I source and also have consignment customers. I do source other items as well but they only represent about 10% of my listings. I have 5000 FB and 500 items listed. 

What confounds me is that I have a friend - who I taught how to sell - who is currently selling 5k per month for similar items where this past month I've sold less than 1K. She doesn't do promotions, sales, or use any kind of strategy. She is incredibly tunnel-visioned and does the same thing over and over and has success, so there's nothing to learn from. She never even understand the seller updates and has to ask me for interpretation. I wish her well, but it's definitely counter-intuitive to me that she is so clueless and non-strategic and generates way more revenue. 

If I were at my current company for 20 years as I've been on eBay, I would be incrementally more well-compensated and be able to park in the attached garage instead of the open-air lot. This is what's so difficult for me to comprehend with eBay. I've followed the rules, have tenure, been through the ups and downs, and instead of thriving, I'm dying. 

I've also expanded to other platforms but sadly, they are just not as robust an engine as eBay. 

Looking for success factors I may have missed. Thank you.",12,6,2019-05-10,EBAY,0.03998320922255516,0.9286999702453613,0.03131675347685814
Ebay,Question about leaving feedback for seller,"First of all, I am been buying and selling on ebay since 1998. And for the most part, have never had a problem. That continues to this day. but I do have a small annoyance, and thought this might be a good place to get advice.

I needed a new laptop, so I took to ebay. I decided I wanted a Surface Book 2, with dedicated Gpu. I found a good one that was listed as ""Like new with no noticeable scratches"". I paid considerably over $1000 for it. 

When it arrived, there was some good and some bad. First the good, it was bought new in February and still had almost the full warranty in effect, but on the top lid, there are scratches. I wouldn't call them substantial, but there are probably 5-6 scratches with a couple being pretty noticeable.

Also, the laptop came really dirty and packaged poorly, which is weird, because I sell a lot of electronics and I like to make sure when my buyer opens it, it looks crisp and new. But on this one the screen was filthy with some sort of film on the edges. It took a microfiber cloth and some glass cleaner to get it looking new, but I got it looking pretty good, despite the scratches.

I am an IT professional, and I am going to scratch this laptop up myself, but I was expecting like new, however, I was able to clean it up, and I am now happy with it. I was going to let it be.

The seller has now sent his second message in 2 days begging for feedback. (he has under 50). I am thinking it has something to do with getting paid as a new seller, but I don't want to leave good feedback... I briefly considered a neutral, but it isn't that bad. I would probably never leave feedback, but he's begging.

I immediately called and was basically treated like a criminal. I was told all my photos were stock photos even though every photo of every item listed was taken by me in using a  lightbox. I was then told that drop shipping is against eBay policy which I'm well aware of. All of my listed items are in my possession and shipped out of my house so I have no idea how they came to that conclusion. They're even dropped off at post offices within a 5-mile radius from my house so the tracking clearly shows I'm not drop shipping.

Ebay,Possible Feedback Extortion/How to Handle,"Haven’t found a situation quite like this while searching, so seeking advice.

Sold an item, listed as refurb/used condition.  Buyer received item and wanted to return it because it was “used.”  Requested return via messages, no formal return requested via eBay.

I informed the buyer that the item did not qualify for a return because it was received as described and in working condition.

Follow up message from buyer included her phone number and email address, along with a threat to “leave me a very bad review” if I did not agree to return the item.

Negative feedback received stating that she made attempts to contact me and I did not respond.

I do not want to keep that bogus negative rating, but I’m also concerned that eBay will force me to allow her to return the item.  I know they lean towards the buyers in regards to most returns.

Ebay,"Buyer wants a full refund with return shipping, or $20, because of something I included in the description.","I'm fairly new to selling on eBay, and I could use some extra cash so I sold some textbooks. One of the books I listed had some water damage from a water bottle opening up in my backpack. Besides the slightly wrinkled pages and slight discoloration on the edge of the book pages, it was in very good condition. No torn or marked pages, no bent corners, clean, etc. I included the water damage in the description and it was visible in the photo. The buyer is requesting a full refund with return shipping, or $20 to compensate for the damage. Is this fair since I did list it in the description?  I paid $15 out of pocket to ship it, and if I pay the same to ship it back, and send it out again, it's basically the cost of the book itself and I'm just losing money. What should I do in this situation?

Edit: Thanks for the helpful responses, I definitely know what to do differently in the future. As for the book, eBay is siding with the buyer on this one, so I think I'll just refund the $20 to make things easier, and avoid any more headache.",32,27,2019-05-13,EBAY,0.04076263681054115,0.9177587032318115,0.04147874563932419

Ebay,Question (thanks for your help),"For the first time ever I accidently switched labels on two items. When I was contacted by the first buyer about the issue (and I realized what I did) I offered to immediately ship the correct item to both parties and issue a $5 refund for the inconvienance. 

One party didn't even want the $5 refund and said mistakes happen. The other party took it and was much more upset because they had wanted the Perfume by Mother's Day. But the mistake was realized on Thursday and so I sent it by Priority  Mail that same day and tracking said it would arrive by Saturday (The day before Mother's Day). Everything seemed resolved.

However the Post office changed the tracking Info on Saturday to say the package will be late (""Your package will arrive later than expected, but is still
on its way. It is currently in transit to the next facility."")

Today it did also not arrive, and the buyer is very upset. His last message to me was:

""I would definitely call the post master of the branch where you sent it from and ask him/her what's two day priority mail mean.
Then tell them what happened, provide the tracking number, you got stiffed and so did I..""

I am reading online that the Post Office won't do anything until 5 days after the package has been mailed.

What should my next step be? Should I call the Post office? I have a migraine today but if calling them will help I will do it. I just doubt it will, but I want to keep this buyer happy.

Ebay,Debate about feedback,"So I'm wondering what the general thoughts on leaving feedback in this case are among the other sellers here. I bought a couple of items from a seller who offered free shipping (cross border from US to Canada). Great! It saves me $7 per item (video games), I'm in. The first game arrives in a plain envelope with the case fractured and crushed. It was also not as described (writing on the disk) so I initiated a return. The seller was open to it, but was little on the passive aggressive side throughout the process. Nothing huge, but it was there.   


Second game arrives, the case is also crushed. Also shipped in a non-padded envelope. I'm not going to initiate a return this time, I didn't feel it was worth the effort versus tracking down a replacement box locally. The buyer contacted me to find out if it arrived alright and I told them what had happened but that, not to worry, I won't go through the hassle of a return, I'll just solve it myself. Again, passive aggressiveness, with her telling me she won't send anything else my way if it is just going to get destroyed.   


Now I wasn't going to leave feedback, I figured it was best just to let things go, but that last deflection really pissed me off. So what are the thoughts from the community here. Should I leave negative or neutral feedback?",38,6,2019-05-14,EBAY,0.05330923572182655,0.9118518233299255,0.034839000552892685

Ebay,How do I deal with a strange return situation?,"I sold a piece of used photography equipment (a big light on an articulated mount) last month. The item was about 5 years old and had been used, loaded and unloaded for its entire life. There were scuffs and scrapes, but nothing that stood out as a serious defect. Every piece of it worked perfectly, and I ultimately settled for his $170 offer, down from my initial price of $250 and up from his original offer of $80. That $170 included free shipping, which cost me around $32.
 
Fast forward to 3-4 days after delivery and I got a nasty message from him saying how it was in terrible condition and he can't believe he would pay so much money for a piece of junk. I was shocked, and asked him to show me pictures of what he was talking about, thinking something may have been damaged in transport. He went ballistic, refusing to send any pictures or describe what he thought was abnormal wear. I ultimately agreed to accept the return, but he waited the entire 7 days before sending it back to me. 

Upon receipt, the first thing I notice is that the box is full of sand and gravel that definitely did not come from here originally. The light appears to be in the same condition as when I sold it, but I did notice that it looks like some kind of sticker or label was put on it, and then peeled off. There's a little bit of adhesive and paper left behind. It was definitely not there before, and its absence can be seen in the listing pics. 
 
I haven't said anything to the buyer yet, and I don't know how to handle this. I feel like he used the light to finish his shoot, and is abusing the return system to get a free equipment rental at my expense. My friend seems to think that this guy put a price tag on it, and tried to sell it at a swap meet or something before returning it. So far, I'm out $65 in shipping and ebay is going to take his refund from me in the next couple of days. 
 
I can resell the light, but what can I do about this buyer? The last thing I want is negative feedback from a clown like this. He sent it back, but it's obviously ""more used"" than it had been.

Ebay,Dispute question,"Sold a video game on eBay. Buyer paid, I shipped. Unfortunately, I left the tracking number in my rental car and was not able to enter it. Big mistake on my part. I hardly ever sell anything on there, but I always add tracking info. I then got a message from the buyer stating that he wanted to return the item because he won auctions on two of the same item. I listed the item as ""no returns"" intentionally as I don't have a ton of time on my hands, it was brand new, and not a high-dollar item. I told him as much, apologized, and said he should sell it himself and could easily get his money back. He proceeds to open a dispute with Paypal stating that ""the item was not as described."" I respond to the dispute explaining the situation, and include a screenshot of my credit card transaction with USPS as it's all I have. Paypal says they're going to review. I then get another message from Paypal stating that his reason for the dispute has changed to ""Item never received,"" which is bogus because he admitted to previously receiving the item. Still, Paypal asks for a response from me. This process repeats two more times (switching reasons back and forth, Paypal asking me for a response) and it seems that Paypal is not catching on. Is this normal? Also, what should I expect as far as the outcome of this case? If Paypal finds in his favor, will he even have to send the game back?

TL;DR - Can a disputing buyer keep a Paypal dispute going on indefinitely by changing the reason back and forth?

Update: Well, they decided in favor of the buyer (big surprise). Spoke with Paypal and they asked me to forward a screenshot of my conversation with him where he says he received package (from eBay), which I did. We'll see what happens.

Update #2: Denied my appeal. “We were unable to grant your appeal with the information you provided. It was not granted because we did not receive valid proof that the item was delivered to the buyer.” Figures. And now he gets his money and the game. What a POS.

Ebay,INAD; device locked because it was reported stolen. Advice?,"Basically, I bought a Fitbit Versa pebble on eBay a few weeks ago. I received it and I tried to hook it up to my phone and it claims that it potentially was stolen. So I spent a few hours on the phone/live chat with Fitbit support and they refused to tell me anything besides that they are ""escalating this investigation"".

I decided not to wait and filed an INAD with a screenshot showing that Fitbit believes it was stolen. I sent it back. Now when I check the seller's profile, he has 23 recent red feedback and a score of 90% (since he was mass selling these). Many people didn't receive and/or when they did, it was broken. I haven't seen anyone say theirs was reported stolen, but I digress.

So, I sent it back and they received it. This seller seems to be completely quiet (to everyone, I guess? Not just me) and I was wondering what would happen if I needed to escalate the refund. What happens at that point, like how long do they have to respond?

Any advice would be appreciated, thank you!",11,8,2019-05-16,EBAY,0.2073781043291092,0.7684627175331116,0.024159206077456474
Ebay,I lost two thousand dollars and I need help,"I sold a pc on ebay for 2000 dollars. Buyer was friendly, helpful, and not at all aggressive. At first he bought my listing for 3500 with some extras, but then he told me didnt want the extras So I relisted at two thousand dollars, which he promptly paid. I then shipped the computer. Then I canceled the first order to avoid seller fees, citing the reason as ""buyer requested cancellation."" I then went to get my money for the one that was sold for 2000 and the buyer paid, but it said the order was cancelled, even though I didnt cancel that order. By this point, I had already shipped, so I couldn't get it back. I contacted ebay, and they told me to send an invoice to the buyer. I contacted the buyer, who up to this point has been nothing but cordial and friendly, who told me that he didn't get the two thousand dollars either. It's been a month since all this, and I'm wondering what I should do next. When I contact ebay about said cancelled item, it says I can't, saying that the buyer has to respond. My thinking is that since the order was cancelled, I should get my computer back, but nothing has happened. The ebay customer service person I called also said this was strange. How can I get my money or computer back?

tl;dr  


I sold a computer and extras, buyer told me he didnt want the extras, i said ok and relisted computer without extras, which he promptly paid the 2000 dollars.

Ebay,Advice on a Return Case.,"Hi, I recently bought a T-mobile phone that costed a lot of money from a “reputable” seller. The listing said Sealed Box, and the description said that the condition was “new”, and it also mention in the listing “contract”. 

I bought it, thinking that “contract” meant that it was only available for T-Mobile. Immediately I asked the seller if the phone was indeed financed, he told me yes. I told him what guaranteed did I have that he would pay of the phone and what if they Blacklisted it ? He told me that he’s never had any problems before. 

So I asked him to please give me the IMEI number on the box to check myself. He quickly deviated and told me again that he was a reputable seller and that it was a pleasure doing business. 

I got the phone today, exactly 5 days after purchase. I took pictures of everything, from the box condition and the IMEI label on the box. I quickly check the phone IMEI on the T-Mobile Checker... surprise it has an Outstanding Balance ! Which means that any moment i could have a brick on my hands.... 

So I say to myself, this could be a mistake, so I carefully opone the package and insert the sim on the phone to check for myself. The phone works, but again it still says OB on the EMEI checker. Which is still a bad IMEI.

The problem is what he didn’t mention on his listing, that the phone was not only financed, but had debt on it. This would go against the purpose of owning a phone because it could go bad any minute. 

His listing said NO RETURNS...

I opened the case immediately on Ebay after the item arrived, in the item not as described section. The fact that he didn’t want to give me the EMEI is a huge red flag, sucks that i had already bought it. The phone could very well be stolen. And now that I think about it, in the photos on the listing he was deliberately hiding the IMEI label on the box. In your guys experience. How strong of a case do I have, and how can I make it stronger.

I offered a full-refund and they could just send it back.

Then he wanted to keep the item after complaining and wanted a partial refund. On a $10 item including shipping. Really?

I told him no, I would take back the item for a full refund because I felt he was trying to work me for a better price and then I looked at his profile and he’s a reseller, so I knew he was working me.

Instead of sending it back he went to leave me negative feedback instead. At the time I had 100% positive and was willing to do a full refund. He was just pissed he didn’t get his way.

I called eBay and they removed the negative because he was trying to extort money and holding the feedback as a weapon over me.

Ebay,Best Offer or Pay Now?,"What’s the best way to go about selling an item? I’ve been selling for a few months now, and things have been great however I’m now running into a few issues, for example I have 4 items that have not been paid for yet. 2 are at elapsed 1 day, and the other 2 just happened today. All 4 were offers that I accepted. I did check the feedback (all 4 account range from 5k to up 25k feedback) and none have negative reviews. All the reviews say they are good buyers with fast payment. I did also hear eBay does have some offer bot accounts too, I’m not sure how true this is but could this be what I’m experiencing? 

It’s looking as though the first two aren’t going to be paying at this point. I’ve sent payment reminders as eBay suggested, still nothing. Obviously this causes problems now for me because I have to wait 48 hours to get eBay involved plus I miss out on two days of the item being posted where it could’ve sold and been shipped out. 

So with all of the above being said, I’d like to get some other sellers opinions. Should I be allowing offers to be made on items I’m selling?

Ebay,How do I explain to this moron that him not having a remote for a TV is not my problem.,"I have sold a factory new OneConnect box for a Samsung TV. In the description I stated that they will get OneConnect box and OneConnect cable. Nothing else. (*that's how they all come from factory*)

Buyer opened up INAD claim under ""Missing parts or pieces"" with comment of ""Unfortunately the box does not work without the remote"" According to him the OneConnect Box is in Set-up mode (*it is new, it should be*) and he cannot complete the set-up as he does not have the remote from the TV anymore to navigate the menu; which is apparently my fault.

I have explained to him that OneConnect boxes do not come equipped with remotes, as all new TVs have remotes included. I have to assume that he has remote to work what he bought. Just lie I have to assume that he has a power cord for the TV, functional TV, and power in his house; without which the box would not work either. That does not mean the pieces are missing.

Remote is not mentioned, listed or depicted in any way shape or form in my listing. I have told him that he cannot claim something is missing, if it is not even included in the listing. He has ignored me since.

Ebay,UK Sellers- Avoiding 'Item Not Recieved' Scammers,"Hi everyone! This mainly applies to UK sellers as I'm unsure as to how postage works in other places, but just thought I'd share my experience here as the 'Item Not Received' case is a frequent and frustrating scam that a lot of people seem to experience.

Up until last year I shipped everything Standard First Class. Over two months I had four 'INR' cases opened against me. I was at uni at the time so I was very unorganised and typically didn't hold onto proof of postage. So, eBay would always rule cases in the buyer's favour and I'd have to refund them. I found in the one case where I did keep the receipt, I wound up losing the case anyway as it wasn't 'sufficient evidence'. 

I thought it was odd that so many parcels were going 'missing', especially since I order so much on eBay and Depop etc yet have never once not had an item turn up. It was always somewhere- a neighbours, under a wheelie bin, etc. A quick Google showed that this was a REALLY common case and always happened to people who sent things Standard 1st/2nd class. 

I started to send things Signed For, and since doing that, not a single person has opened an 'INR' case. I keep hold of all my receipts and add the tracking number to items when I have the chance. Recently, however, I sold an item and my mum offered to send it for me. I was busy with work so I let her, but when she handed me the receipt I realised she'd just sent it Standard 2nd Class. Fast forward one week and lo and behold, the buyer opened an 'INR' case. Hm. Luckily, Royal Mail let you check online with a reference number to see if the item's been delivered. So I checked and it has been confirmed as delivered. Added this to the 'INR' case and am currently awaiting a response. My mum feels bad, bless her, but it's a lesson learned!

So, basically, I'd thoroughly recommend UK sellers send all items Signed For. 2nd class Large Letter is £2.70, and 2nd Class Small Parcel is £4, which is only a £1 more than standard postage and saves the hassle of 'INR' cases as you can track the item. It also covers up to £50 IF the item actually gets lost. I typically just state in the description that I only send Signed For and charge £4.10 as standard to cover the parcel cost as well. If you don't want to up your postage in case it puts buyers off, just add it to the asking price/starting bid!

TLDR: The 'INR' case seems to be a very common scam, as eBay will side with buyers 99% of the time + force you to refund if you can't provide a tracking number. Easy fix- send all items Signed For instead, and add the tracking number to each item.",19,7,2019-05-21,EBAY,0.10989534854888916,0.8637204170227051,0.0263842660933733

Ebay,"Buyer's Remorse ""They looked white in the picture""","Just a mini rant here. Remorse returns are expected when you offer 30-day returns (not free) but it's always worth a chuckle when the buyer admits to not reading the description or even the full title.

We recently sold a pair of Jordans listed as Cream/Black both in the title and description, with photos showing clear contrast between our white backdrop and the off-white color of the sneakers.

After 3-day priority shipping, got a message from the buyer: ""Hey there, sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. My package arrived today; however I purchased them based off the color they appeared to be in the photo. I am in search of the white and black pair only. How do we get the refund process started?""

I replied professionally, apologizing for *their* mistake, mentioning our other white/black listings, outlining the steps involved in the return process, and pointing out the total cost of their return (as we don't refund shipping). Essentially they're going to pay about $15-16 to return a pair of shoes they paid $50 for.

Not sure at this point if they're actually going to go through with the return, but I had a few thoughts about this buyer and their message.

1: They're at least polite and capable of using complete and grammatically correct sentences. Let this be a notice to all buyers - if you're friendly, most sellers will be more willing to work with you.

2: They (like many buyers) purchased an item based SOLELY on the main photo, and didn't pay attention to the title or the description. Their lack of attention to detail has essentially cost them $16. People, if you can't be bothered to read, don't be surprised by dashed expectations.

3: They're uber concerned about the ""refund process"" but seem to have overlooked the ""return process"". I can't be sure if that was an innocent mistake or if they genuinely thought they could get a refund without returning their purchase.

Update: The buyer messaged asking about a possible exchange... on a pre-owned item... Just so y'all are aware, there's no such thing as identical and equally valuable ""pre-owned"" shoes in different colors.

I know that it is not on my end because I completed another purchase at the same time and that went through fine and never had this issue before.

After doing some research, the cause could be :

1) new seller made a typo in the paypal address for the listing and thus the payment may be unclaimed

2) the new seller's paypal is not verified or set up correctly

Are there instances where the seller has to accept the payment because they are new, despite it usually being automatic? 

Or does this have to do with paypal holding the funds to make sure the seller is legitimate? But does it still cause an hourglass symbol? I thought the checkout payment is already processed and the funds are held until shipped and released a couple days after delivery.

Ebay,"Buyer msgs me 34 days after delivery, admitted to 15 hours of use, and claims item is broken","Hi, I sold a high end electronic, delivered on april 19th. Buyer messages me tonight and says that there is a fault in the screen, it was working fine up till then. They did admit ~15 hours of use and the fault just occurred. 

Normally i know the best thing to do is issue a return and file a case after once item is not received in original condition, but i simply can’t afford to wait on that, it was a decent amount of money. 

My question is, will eBay still make me take a return if they buyer clearly stated in messages they used it for a decent amount and was working fine until the 34th day? 

I have not yet replied yet, planning out of course of action right now. I’ve done several returns before but none regarding several thousand dollars, and none in which the buyer received a perfectly described, working item that broke through a months ownership.

Ebay,Are postage prices making it not worthwhile to sell online anymore?,"Selling online is proving to be difficult to make my profit worthwhile anymore, esp. on items under $20 that require a larger mailing package. I have always had the most competitive prices on eBay, but with postage constantly going up, I am not sure how people do it.

I know people cheat the system, as I have bought items on eBay where the seller printed off a shipping label that was underweight.

Ebay,Help! Seller defrauded me with fake FedEx tracking number,"On a recent Friday I bought a backpack on eBay with Buy It Now and paid with Paypal (connected to my bank account). Weekend passed and the next Tuesday I got an auto email that my package has shipped (with a FedEx tracking number) followed up with another auto email that it was delivered. (Note that the delivery address on the tracking screen shows my town only and not my specific address.) I hurry home from work (about 2hrs after supposed delivery) but there's no package. I wait a day in case the FedEx delivery got bumped some how... nothing. My neighborhood is safe and never experiences ""porch thieves"", so that never was a real thought.

I open a claim on eBay requesting a follow-up from the seller, but they remain quiet. Every day I msg the seller for updates, but hear nothing. On the last day eBay closes the case in favor of the seller because ""they provided a tracking number"". 

I pursue a claim with Paypal, but they also close my claim as a tracking number was provided. 

Neither eBay nor Paypal followed up with FedEx.

When I called FedEx, they immediately verified that neither my name nor my address are attached to the tracking number. They also say because my name/address are not attached to the tracking they can not provide anything in writing to help me dispute the closed claims.

I am not sure how to reclaim my money ($80) at this point. Any help/suggestions are appreciated.

Ebay,Buyer claims I sent a fake GoPro,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am somewhat of what you would call an ""inexperienced seller"". I have about 241 reviews, 98%. I am afraid I may finally be getting initiated to the scammer community.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, recently I sold a GoPro Hero 7 Black, with an extra battery. A day after receiving the item, the buyer sends me this message -

&amp;#x200B;

"" Hello, this camera is not turning on  
I use YouTube to see how and mine is not turning on please advise how to use ""

&amp;#x200B;

I sent him a link to a YouTube video, and asked him to follow it. Just keep pressing down the power button, and it should turn on. Then he sends me this -

&amp;#x200B;

"" Hello I watched your video and it didn t work. I took to best buy geek squad and they couldn t turn it on. Please advise alternative? ""

&amp;#x200B;

My reply, being frustrated with this guy - "" It should work. I sent you a practically new GoPro camera. Press the power button on the side, and it should turn on. The camera is also under warranty by GoPro. You can contact them. ""

&amp;#x200B;

As per my ad, I also sent him the PDF of the invoice from BHPhotoVideo, which I had bought it from. And told him that he can register it under warranty, and do any claims as he pleases. The camera is literally new, and I did a factory reset just before shipping it to him with the battery 100% charged. There is no way this camera is not turning on. I had also purchased additional warranty from USPS in case it got damaged from shipping. 

&amp;#x200B;

So putting all my doubts aside, and hoping this guy finally figured out how to turn the camera on - I woke up to a claim from eBay as well as a message from him. I am flabbergasted.  Why do people like this exist? What is he trying to do? Why steal? He is practically trying to steal my hard earned money.

&amp;#x200B;

"" Are you sure you sent the right item? Something isn't right here. My nephew is telling me I was scammed but my friend says ebay is trust worthy. ""

&amp;#x200B;

And this is the case from eBay - 

"" 

**Info from the buyer**

Reason

Wrong item sent

Comments

My nephew informed me this is not a GoPro HERO7 Black and might be a scam. Please contact seller to make sure right item was sent?""

&amp;#x200B;

What in the world is this guy trying to do? Why? 

&amp;#x200B;

What IF he actually sends me a fake GoPro back? What is my course of action? Based on what I've read online, eBay usually sides with the buyers. I am scared now. I don't want to be out of $350, and deal with fees and such, and also lose my camera at the same time.

So now they have opened a Paypal Claim, claiming that item is defective. 

I’ve already deleted my banks from my Paypal Wallet, pulled my money out, just to be on the safe side. 

My written response to dispute will be:
“I’m sorry but item was as described. Shipped and delivered working fully, buyer even admitted in messages about how well padded/secured the packing/shipping was, and that it was working just fine when received. It has been well over 30 days since it was delivered and used. I understand Buyer Protection, but that does not equate to a Product Warranty.  Item is a delicate electronic that can be damaged easily, hence the overboard packing when shipped, but was working fine when delivered, and worked fine past 30 days since delivery. 

I can also include messages between me and the buyer off eBay verifying my claims if that would help. Thank you. “

Ebay,Buyer claiming damage after nearly two weeks,"I sold a used phone 2 weeks ago. It was described as scratches to the body of the phone but screen unmarked, and that was an accurate description. I have videos of it working perfectly, switching on and off etc. I sold it at 11pm, the seller was messaging me the next day (a sunday) asking why it wasnt dispatched yet and demanding I hurry up. The post office was closed and it was posted on the Monday.

Fast forward to 11 days later and they open a refund case claiming it wasn't in the condition described. They said that the speaker was broken, the charger port was broken and the screen was damaged. They said they just hadn't opened it for 2 weeks because they'd been away. Now I have proof that all those things were fine before it was shipped and the buyer has said they were happy with packaging and they don't think it was damaged during shipping.

The speaker being broken has turned out to be wrong, they then said it was just too quiet and I sent them a review article which said that the top speaker was quiet on that phone model. 

They are saying the charger port is loose and occasionally if they wiggle it it goes from fast to slow charge. I was using it up until the day I sold it and I never experienced an issue with charging. The charger port was always on the loose side but never any issue charging and I have video proof it was charging fine before I sold it.

So the screen issue. They admit it is unmarked. They are claiming there is a small patch that is brighter than the rest and that the bottom looks like the LED is damaged from certain angles. They sent pictures but I have to say it is barely noticeable and may just be the light. I have a video from before I sent it of the screen on a similar bright white background and it looks perfect and there is no problem.

I don't know what to do. I paid a lot for postage and have already had PayPal fees deducted. If I give a full refund and have to pay for return postage I will be looking at 30-40% of what I sold it for lost. I find it suspicious that they were demanding it was posted immediately the next day, which wasn't a working day, and then didn't open it for 10 or 11 days. I also think the issues have been invented to try and get a refund, and that I sold the phone in the condition it was described. I offered to go through postal insurance if the screen was damaged and they said the screen wasn't scratched or marked and it was packaged well so they don't think it was a postal problem.

Ebay,Help with selling process,"New seller here. I was wondering if someone could outline the selling process primarily to avoid scams but also to just be confident when I accept an offer. I would like to apologize ahead of time as I'm sure these questions have likely been answered but I have not been able to find them.

So once I've posted the item, what should I be wary of? Should I try to stay away from first time buyers and new accounts? Also when it comes to PayPal, I'm sure they have some sort of buyer protection that scammers try to use to their advantage. What should I be careful with? It is my understanding that I should not give out my PayPal email to the buyer as they should be able to pay through eBay. This way I can avoid fake PayPal notifications. And then once I've received payment do I just ship the item? Is there anything I should know when shipping? Do I need to include tracking or should I take pictures right before shipping?

Ebay,"I closed my three year old eBay account, here's why!","Hello all,

As a new poster in this subreddit I'd just like to say I'm very glad there's exposure out here for the way eBay treats sellers.

I sold an Intel Core i7-8700K processor for $350 with free shipping on eBay after I have sold tens of thousands of dollars with the platform. A 0 star buyer purchased the item, and if I didn't send it out, he would've likely started this whole issue right from the beginning by opening a case for not receiving the item. 

Anyways, I shipped the item out and it was delivered to an address in New Castle, Delaware. My listing and account explicitly state that I sell as-is items with no returns. The buyer then opened a case the next day stating that the product was defective and freezing his computer up (almost impossible) and I was forced to take his return and authorize the cost of return shipping to be pulled from my bank account whenever used. The buyer then added tracking information for the return roughly 4-6 days later, which was not the label that I provided through eBay for him. He then opened a case 40 minutes later against me stating I had not sent out a refund (I wonder why, I never received the return!). eBay immediately took $350 straight from my bank account, which added an additional $39 bank admin fee for insufficient funds. 

After looking at the tracking number provided by the buyer, this tracking number stated it was delivered 4 days before the customer even submitted the information, which immediately triggered eBay's garbage system to provide a full refund with no rebuttal options.

Side note, the shipping information provided was shipping from New York (over 150 miles away from Delaware) and it shipped to a Jack in the Box restaurant that was in the same zip code as I live in (thus triggering ebay's system to immediately provide a full refund)

I spent over 30 hours speaking with eBay customer support agents, supervisors, USPS agents, my apartment building, and the Jack in the Box which the provided shipping number indicated the item was shipped to, with no avail. I put in two different appeals with more than significant information that this was a fraud case, to which each appeal was denied.

I am now out a $350 item and my money.

eBay and their ""Seller Protection"" policy. eBay doesn't care whatsoever about any of their sellers.

I hope anybody that reads this rethinks their dealings with eBay, and if not, it's only a matter of time until you come across this.

**COMBINED EDITS &amp; UPDATES** - 

I used ""seller"" instead of ""buyer"" in two instances in the original post. I was the seller of the item. 

Computer processors are known to be one of the most solid components reliability-wise when it comes to computer components, and the processor in question had been in use for 3 months with no issues prior to sale.

The Jack in the Box restaurant is in the same zip code as I live in, not as the New York location the buyer's shipping label shipped from. This may have been a point of confusion.

After further investigation, the address I shipped to is a freight forwarder, which would cancel out any buyer protections available. I cannot believe eBay didn't catch this during the case, and on my end, I honestly shouldn't have to even so much as blink at the shipping address for items I've sold. You can't take 9% or up to $50 from my sale and then turn around and put minimal effort into helping me when I need it most. Reports have indicated that once this is mentioned to eBay representatives, they must refund the seller. I've put in a note with them regarding this. We will see how it goes.

I am now in the process of investigating other options with an eBay representative.

eBay for Business Facebook Page response is in a comment below, sort by new.

Processor was working flawlessly before sale. This whole situation is a scam.

What's worse, it looks as though the seller has closed their shop (hundreds of items for sale one day, 0 the next).

Ebay,Fraud reports make for a frustrating transaction...,"Someone bought and paid for a listing, immediately asked to ship to an alternate address because they ""probably won't be home"", and never responded to our reply about being unable to change an address.

Fast forward to last day to ship, I had already informed the buyer I would cancel if I didn't get a response by 10am today. No response, so I tried to cancel for problem with address.

Cue error message about an open PayPal case. WTF? I hadn't even sent it yet, how was there a case?

Opened PayPal, saw the reason for the dispute was fraud. No real surprise. Not a fan of digital response (because any number of things could go wrong) I called PP to handle it over the phone instead. But they wouldn't talk to me til hubby (the account holder) got home, so onto the next step.

Called eBay, explained the situation, and they informed me the account holder had reported fraudulent access.

So someone hacked their account, no surprise. Why didn't we get a message from eBay about it? If I wasn't so diligent about following up, we could have shipped and been out almost $100!

Well, we were *supposed* to get a notification from eBay. Apparently there's a bug in the system that prevented a seller from being notified that an account they sold to had been compromised. How convenient.

Anyway, went into PayPal's dispute center to see what options I had. Lo and behold, I could issue a refund and close the case. *Click!*

Cue eBay rep telling me it shows ""resolved in buyer's favor"". So will I get a defect for that? No. Will I get my FVF back? I can put in a request for that right now.

Good, so the PP case is resolved, the buyer is refunded, we won't get a defect, and we'll get our FVF credited back, all is well in the world right?

Back to seller dashboard. One item ready to ship. The order still hasn't been canceled. Another bug? I check PP. Case shows refunded, but the transaction itself is still there with the option to refund. Confused...

Back to eBay, try to cancel the order. Error, PP case open. *facepalm*

Guess I'm onto PP chat to see what the issue is, then ebay again to make it go away...

Ugh, I really don't care for these buggy automated systems...

...

Update: PayPal shows the way it does because of legal restrictions that forced the refund as a payment rather than an actual refund. Weird, but ok.

Called eBay, and after 3 transfers, they were able to relist my item, but the original is still going to sit there ""awaiting shipment"" until the system finally removes it because ebay's software doesn't allow a cancellation on an order with a case, open *or* closed.

Ebay,UPDATE: eBay Managed Payments Fee Increase,"Last week eBay made a stealth (unannounced or otherwise communicated) change on it's payments terms page adding, amongst other things, a new $0.25 ""Per Listing Payments Fee"": [https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html](https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html)

&amp;#x200B;

This fee will apply to accounts that are not migrated to eBay's managed payments by June 4th. This 25-cent listing payments fee works similarly to an insertion fee, in that it is based on the number of listings in an order (not the number of items).

&amp;#x200B;

Last year, **eBay** frequently touted Managed Payments savings to eBay sellers and merchants, and featured a piece on the corporate and investor site titled ""[**Sellers Save in eBay’s Managed Payments**](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/sellers-save-in-ebays-managed-payments/)""

[eBay Managed Payments Infographic](https://i.redd.it/f2oq6gdj22131.png)

Independent ecommerce news sites also posted updates of the news last week including UK's TameBay.com's ""[eBay to Hike eBay Managed Payments fees](https://tamebay.com/2019/05/ebay-hike-ebay-managed-payments-fees.html)"" article correctly stating ""at a stroke wipes out one of the massive attractions of eBay Managed Payments compared to PayPal""

&amp;#x200B;

[ecommmmercebytes.com](https://ecommercebytes.com) also posted an article, ""[Warning: eBay Raises Payment Processing Fees](https://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/blog/blog.pl?/pl/2019/5/1558618552.html)"" pointing out although current members are grandfathered, ""there's no guarantee those terms won't change in the future.""

https://i.redd.it/vxd2cnlb32131.png

&amp;#x200B;

eBay is getting more creative in sneaking in seller and ad fees. This new fee is for practical purposes essentially double-dipping an eBay listing insertion fee, except after the sale (""extraction fee""? ""re-insertion fee""?)😕

&amp;#x200B;

A stealth UA/TOS update is an underhanded way of breaking this type of significant news to seller-customers and it will hit merchants with lower ASPs hardest, in many instances eroding **any** MP savings over PayPal for multi listing quantity items below \~$100.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking a look at a sample using standard rates, a $90 order comprised of 2 items from 2 listings will actually cost more with eBay's managed payments than with PayPal.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/8nbn7p3s32131.png

&amp;#x200B;

This gap widens the more listing items are included in the sale with eBay to charge $0.25 on every listing included in the order.  Again very bad news indeed for eBay merchants with smaller, lower priced items that frequently sell from multiple listings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/oqne30zx32131.png

Merchants and **eBay** **Selle\*\*\*\*rs** who frequently sell many multiple items from different listings (buttons, small parts &amp; accessories, components, etc) will want to reconsider their model, as the gap can become egregious and expensive on eBay's managed payments:

Ebay,PSA: eBay bucks cap at $100 on a single purchase,"With eBay running 10% bucks promotions decently often this might come up for people. You also cap at $500 earned per quarter. 

This applies per transaction. If you are trying to take advantage of a 10% promo on a $1k+ item, split it into multiple orders. 

It's unclear how invoicing multiple items together is impacted but if you have to do combined shipping and it would go above $1k, take the shipping off individual items rather than one large invoice. 

eBay bucks are from the base price, not price including shipping. Items with free shipping benefit more. If you invoice to remove shipping make sure to remove shipping rather than applying a discount - discounts go against the base price.

Normally I would probably just take it, but the guy is being a REAL jerk.  Claiming im not responding to him (He sent a message 8pm yesterday, then sent a 'why are you ignoring me' message at 9am)

I kind of just want to tell him to fk off.  I really doubt this guy knows how to use paypal, but what are my options here should I decide to roll with the description says not working angle.

Ebay,"Proof that Ebay hides listings on small stores. Here is how to replicate it. Also, some other Tom fuckery to get your goat.","This is on the Ebay app which reportedly over 50% of sales come from now - this is one major reason why sales have tanked.  Whether you sell zebra pens, Hoosker do’s or Hoosker dont’s or springs for flip flops this applies to all of us sellers. If buyers don’t see ALL of our items for sale then we lose sales. Can’t buy your favorite item if you think the store doesn’t have it any more.

1. Open your app
2. Go to your store or another sellers
3. SORT BY LOWEST PRICE
4. You will only see 40/68/80 items total. Randomized in order. 
5. If the seller is an enterprise store (most big China junk shops are as well as big time sellers) all their items show in order from lowest to highest. Not just 40 random items from a wide price range. 

Couldn’t figure out why all our small priced $10 and under items that were normally multi orders had stopped, we had a customer ask us why we stopped selling xxxxxx and ended up figuring this out. They could no longer see the lower priced items and thought I was closing the store since only 40 listings show when the store carries  2,000 plus items monthly.

Also - if you run sales and a repeat buyer comes back the cart checkout will give them a message they “purchased too many sale items” and are unable to complete checkout after they stop back a few times. 

Technical Support says this can not be replicated and I am using the app wrong🌟👌🏽

Promoted listings ...... for the love of chocolate peanut butter. 
If you run sales in your store and mark things off   Say like %50 off msrp- you must not have a promoted listings campaign that will include that item until after your initial price drop. 
Otherwise you will pay PL fees on the MSRP price not your sale price.  Because as we all know buyers only click on promoted listing ads now at the highest rate within 30 days. 

“ everything you sold was a promoted listing this month , trust us! Wink Wink 💰 “",50,68,2019-05-30,EBAY,0.09047483652830124,0.8793689012527466,0.030156278982758522
Ebay,When you block a lowballer...and they don't take the hint,"A couple weeks ago I listed several pairs of jeans, NWT.  These retail for $40 in stores.  I have them listed for $30, free shipping, 1 day handling, best offer enabled.  Within a week I sold one for $28 and one for $30 and I still have a couple pairs left.

A couple days ago I receive an offer for $12.  I declined.  A few hours later, same buyer, an offer for $14.  Decline.  Then yesterday she offers $16.  Okay, it's over 50% so maybe she's willing to negotiate - I come back with $26.  She replied with $16.  Again, I decline.

After looking at her feedback left for others, I figure I dodged a bullet and did a cautionary block.  Then this morning I get an email asking why she can't make another offer on my items.  I've not responded because I don't know what else to say other than the obvious.",32,58,2019-05-30,EBAY,0.12990087270736694,0.8360906839370728,0.03400852531194687

These aren't high value items or anything, just odds and ends from clearing out my attic, so I can't imagine that they're rival sellers trying to limit the supply of old hair curlers and cassette players (but then I also wouldn't expect someone to make a brand new ebay account with the genuine intention of buying that box of hair curlers).

Ebay,Software Bug: Sellers can see your max bids,"I disclosed this to the ebay security team already, but since they don't offer a bug bounty or even the courtesy of a confirmation email when disclosing major security problems I think this should be public knowledge.

I am a small-time eBay seller (about 5 active items at any time). I have a listing that received an opening bid of $0.99 recently. The eBay iPhone app notifies me when someone bids on my items, and the notification I received for the $0.99 bid had a higher bid amount which I can only assume is the bidder's maximum bid.

I play fair, I don't intend to shill bid. But if you are out there bidding early on eBay auctions be warned that sellers may be able to see your maximum bids.",2,10,2019-05-31,EBAY,0.05066854506731033,0.8894091248512268,0.059922315180301666
Ebay,Auction winner trying to buy after resolved unpaid item case,"I had somebody win an auction Sunday before last, 5/19, and they did not pay within 48 hours of winning. I have my account set up to automatically open an unpaid item case after 48 hours without payment, and this policy is clearly spelled out in all my listing descriptions.

I sent an invoice, but otherwise had no communication from the buyer, so the unpaid item case opened on 5/22 and was resolved on 5/26 without incident.

Yesterday evening, 5/30, the buyer messaged me saying ""hello...jus tried2pay4auction...its not allowin me. please advise."" They've been an ebay user since 2012 with a rating above 500, so I find it difficult to believe that they are unfamiliar with the unpaid item case process. Are they trying to somehow scam me? Do I even dignify this with a response? I'm not inclined to offer them the item in question again, after they blew me off for a whole week and a half.

Ebay,eBay sketchy Not As Described case = Advice requested,"Sup! 

So I am in a situation where I sent (foolishly I guess) a fully functioning speaker system to someone in another country on a no returns sale for £450 including shipping. I mentioned a few cosmetic items but noted the item was fully functional, which it was. 

Upon receipt buyer sends a salty email saying something along the lines of ""There is something not right with this, one tweeter is a different colour. I'll get it tested"" to which I responded telling him ""Sorry you aren't happy. Yes please get it tested and keep me updated"". 

A week goes by and he tells me has had it looked at by a ""Pro technician"" who told him the tweeter is ""missing a magnet"" and it would cost 700 euros to fix. This is of course, nonsense. The item worked fine when I sent it and a replacement tweeter would not cost more than the value of the system.

He kept pushing me to pay a partial refund of £340, and when I told him I wouldn't do that but I was happy to refund him fully, or help him get the item fixed, despite his objections being nonsensical, he did a chargeback through Paypal for the partial refund. 

After going through a few emails explaining that it can't be missing a magnet, but fine, send it back and I'll refund you. I still haven't fully determined if the tweeter is actually malfunctioning or not, as he refuses to tell me, just insisting it ""cannot work, it is missing a magnet""!!

My Paypal is now showing a -£430 balance, so I can only assume he has also requested a chargeback for the full amount. 

I sent him the cost of a courier via Paypal, which is now stuck on pending, presumably due to this mess. 

Buyer is refusing to send back the item until he gets a full refund. I'm a bit of an eBay noob having not used it much, but what are my options here? I'm happy to refund the guy, once I get the damn thing back. Given he was pushing quite hard for an insane partial refund, and he is being so sketchy about the details, I feel like if I refund him I'll never see my money or the system again. 

I considered opening a dispute, but the consensus appears to be ""Sellers should NOT open disputes"". 

Any help appreciated. Cheers!",18,5,2019-05-31,EBAY,0.06265446543693542,0.8968008756637573,0.04054471477866173

Ebay,"Seller canceled order, refunded money. Then opened an unpaid item case against me.","Two days ago I won an auction for an item and paid immediately.  Then, yesterday evening I received a message from the seller saying they had over listed the item and did not have the inventory to fulfill the order so they would be issuing a refund.  I received the refund notification from Paypal but when I log in to my account now this is showing as an unpaid item rather than a canceled order.

I spoke with Ebay customer service and they confirmed that the seller had opened an unpaid item case.  They said that I would get  a mark against my account but to call them if I noticed account limitations and they could remove it.  

Anyone else ran into this scenario and if so, is that really the only way to resolve it?  The way the seller handled communicated the cancellation to me initially was pretty shady, but this seems like a way for them to avoid getting a canceled order mark against them.

Update:  After talking with customer service I sent a message to the seller notifying them that I was aware of the unpaid item claim that was opened against my account and requested them to resolve it urgently.
