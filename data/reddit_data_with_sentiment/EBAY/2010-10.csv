Ebay,think this is legit? ebay/paypal should pay me back if not right?,"I suppose if it seems fishy on the internet it probably is. But I'm looking for a ds for my daughter. Found one on ebay for a decent price, 0 bids so far. Comes with a bunch of girly games.

Its listed as being not far from me so I email the seller and ask if I can pick it up, here's the replies I got. 

""My DS Lite is going to go threw the regular proses of e-bay. I'm going to ship it to you threw mail. You don't come to my house to pick it up. If you want to buy it, it's going to be shipped the regular way. Or if you mean available for pick up at the e-bay store, then i have to get more familiar with that type of proses and then if I will try to do it that way if your interested in buying the DS. Did I answer your question?"" - It is in KY, could explain the poor english.

Reply #2 seems to be spelt correctly ""No. I'm going to ship it the normal way. I'm sorry. But remember you don't have to buy it. :) ""

Seller is brand new, no feedback shipping is listed as $.01. They are selling around 5 ds's.",4,3,2010-10-26,EBAY,0.05030275508761406,0.9094527959823608,0.04024441912770271

Ebay,How to increase views of unusual auction?,"Hello Reddit, long-time lurker here. First post, woo!

I have recently listed an auction for an uncommon and high-value item on Ebay (UK). I'll not give the link here as the purpose of this post is not to generate views but to get advice. 

The listing is for an item of scientific equipment. I know what it is and what it does but other than that my knowledge is limited. It's a long story as to how it came into my posession, suffice to say it didn't come off the back of a lorry, it's kosher. I've checked the serial number with the manufacturer and they are happy with its provenance. 

There are no other matching items on Ebay UK or US so it seems unlikely that anyone would find it through searching on Ebay itself. My question is how would I go about generating interest in the listing? 

Many thanks in advance for any advice.",1,4,2010-10-27,EBAY,0.021887583658099174,0.9182865023612976,0.059825874865055084
