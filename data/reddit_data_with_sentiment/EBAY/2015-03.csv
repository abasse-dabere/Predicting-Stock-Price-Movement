Ebay,Seller waited 2 extra days to ship and used slower service than I paid for,"So I recently bought a shirt from a seller who had good feedback. His listing said ""1 day"" handling time. But he posted it 3 days later without a tracking number. I don't really care because hey it's ebay! However, the only shipping service he offered was USPS priority mail for $10.00, so I expected that I would probably get in 2-4 days after he marked it as shipped. Well, it arrived today which is 6 business days after it was marked as shipped. I saw that the seller used ""Standard Post."" When I contacted the seller, he told me: Well shipping via standard post cost more than the $10.00 you paid so are lucky I didn't charge you more.

I'm a little pissed. First, he was late shipping (whatever) but then he didn't even have the courtesy to use the shipping method I (had) to pay for? Secondly, he didn't even bother to upload the tracking number which was on the package. Thirdly, I'm pretty sure the only reason postage was so much is because he used a *giant* box. Seriously, you could have fit a baby and several shirts in the box he sent me. 

I don't think I'm being unreasonable, but what kind of response should I send him?",15,8,2015-03-01,EBAY,0.03192828223109245,0.9037315249443054,0.06434021145105362
Ebay,Am I the only one who finds this eBay behavior appalling?,"I'm not a wild, anti-ebay complainer.  I think fees are fair, and I think eBay works hard to make a good marketplace.


tl;dr - eBay doesn't refund partial refunds, and prohibits for fee release on anything less than a 100% refund.  I think this is wrong bad bad bad.


**Am I obsessively getting angry over nothing?  Perhaps I've worked alone for too long and I've gone crazy and bitter.  Please help!**



**The problem** - When I sell something with free shipping, and a buyer's mistake leads to a return, I refund the original sale price minus the $2 I paid to ship.  I am no longer able to get fees back if I do not refund 100%.  *Even though 95% of a transaction has been refunded, eBay takes 100% of their commission.*


**The other problem** - When I have to make a partial refund, this means that... my item sold for less money!  Why does the fee apply to the original, and now irrelevant, sale price?  It's not the industry standard -- In fact, it's not even standard in any analogous sense (if you get a refund on a rewards credit card, you don't get to keep the rewards points, for instance.)

Ebay,If it sounds too good to be true...,"...it probably is. I keep telling myself this and that I should walk away. Please, if you have a moment, tell me your thoughts.

I came across an ad on a free internet classifieds website (yes, that one) for someone looking for an eBay seller. Here is the text: ""I am searching for a generous eBay seller with a good feedback rating to list my business merchandise online. Super profit potential here for someone. Please leave a name and contact # where we can discuss further important details. Out of state and college individuals feel free to reply. Thank you for reading my post.""

I figured what the heck. Emailed the guy, he called me today.

He talked really fast (first red flag). He called himself a ""businessman"" (second red flag, is this 1950?). He wants me to sell jewelry online and he will cut me 10% (sounds too good to be true, third red flag).

I have so many doubts - is the merch stolen? is it counterfeit?

He emailed me pictures and a description or a ring and earring set, which pretty much kills my thought of ""well maybe he's terrible at computers or doesn't understand eBay"" because this description seems like he knows eBay enough. Certainly enough to pay an established business to sell on his behalf, why would he need me? OK maybe it's because I have 100% feedback. But it's a set valued at $9,000+, by the IGI (I had to look them up). Why would you pay someone you've never met a potential $900 to sell an item that (if it's legit) should have no problem selling through other channels.

My spidey sense is tingling. I have emailed him a few questions (most important one being ""Can we meet before I post the auction? I need to verify the merchandise is as described before I post the auction"") to buy some time. But it sounds too good to be true...

I have 13 years of eBay selling and 100% feedback at stake here. I have been scammed on both the seller and buyer side so I am pretty sure I should run for the hills on this one.",11,3,2015-03-01,EBAY,0.02941953018307686,0.9309685230255127,0.03961195424199104
Ebay,Partial refund technical problems,"As a seller, I had an order totaling about £7. About a week after it was paid AND dispatched I issued a partial refund for the £2.20 postage through PayPal. When I went back to view the user's order history in ""Sold"" records, I saw that this order no longer had a ""Paid date"" and the payment icon said something like ""You marked this as payment not received. However, it was paid through PayPal"".

Obviously worried that this would go down as an unpaid item and have a case opened automatically against the innocent buyer, I got in touch with eBay via their live chat. The rep seemed confused about why I thought this was unpaid, and really just couldn't help in any way (despite asking and telling me several useless and sometimes 100% irrelevant things). All the while I was thinking this must be some kind of glitch really, so I was mostly sympathetic to their uselessness.

I've issued partial refunds in the past, but probably never really went back to check the sales again so might not have noticed this before. But surely it doesn't make sense that issuing a partial refund for a paid &amp; dispatched order would translate in eBay to ""You marked this as payment not received"". 

The rep couldn't even confirm to me that this would never end up as an automatic Unpaid Item case either. Sure hope it doesn't come to that, because in my experience eBay help reps never do anything about those cases except to either confirm they exist or confirm they can do nothing about them at the point in time where you just so happen to conveniently be.",7,2,2015-03-01,EBAY,0.10645293444395065,0.8622815608978271,0.0312655046582222

Ebay,A known scammer just bought my item. How can I cancel the transaction without a fee or negative feedback?,"I thought something was fishy when the buyer bought my item.  His ebay account lists his location in Germany, and I explicitly set no international shipping.  So I messaged the buyer about this, and he never replied.  He also didn't send payment until I tried to cancel the order.  He has over 4000 feedback, but the last positive activity was from over a year ago.  Since then, all he has done is left negative feedback for sellers (probably ones that caught his scam and never shipped to him).  It looks like it's a hacked account.

Once he paid, I had his address (which is in the US).  I did a quick google search on his address and the first several results are on badbuyerlist.org with pages, and pages, and MORE pages of people reporting scams with his exact same address.

I will NOT send out anything to this person.  I am 100% sure this is a scam buyer.  Is there a way I can get eBay to cancel this transaction and not charge me any fees?  It would also be great if feedback was also blocked from this person.

Please help!  I've been an eBay member since 1999 and have 100% positive feedback.  I'd like to keep it that way.

UPDATE: The buyer denied my attempt to cancel the order.  I called eBay and the phone rep was very helpful.  I explained the situation and she immediately issued a final value fee credit.

Ebay,Defect removed,"Called up yesterday.  Had an ""Item not as described"" defect despite a positive feedback which read ""Item as described thank you fast shipping""  The feedback was from about 118 days ago.  I hadn't really mined through my feedbacks looking for inaccurate defects as my defect rate has been around 2.7% since they started this horrendous evaluation program, but it's down to about 2.2% and 2.03% currently before this one gets removed.  I talked to one guy, he read all the info, including the feedback received as well as a message from the buyer thanking me and saying how great the item was and asking for return feedback.  He agrees to remove the defect since it contradicts the feedback comments.  Then I get a message saying since it has been over 90 days they can't remove the defect and he sends me a link to [ebay's defect removal policy](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/defect-removal.html) which says nothing about the time frame.  I had actually called earlier this week to have an item not received defect removed since I had confirmed shipment proof, that woman said they can't go back beyond 6 months.  So when I got this message after talking to the guy I talked to another woman and she said it's 120 days that they can go back.  So I was pretty stern at this point, saying I expect this to be removed since it's within 120 days, the other guy already approved the removal then sent me an email saying he couldn't and that there is no time frame referenced on the policy and 3 different people over there have given me 3 different time frames and ebay isn't on the same page.  So that was yesterday, it could take up until Thursday for the defect to disappear she said, but I didn't get an email. I jotted down the reference numbers from both calls and got their names.

Ebay,New to eBay and I think I really screwed up a transaction. Help?,"Sorry if posts like these aren't within the posting rules of the sub.

So, I was selling an item for the first time on eBay. I made it very clear in my description that I was only willing and able to ship within the U.S. and would not ship internationally.

A week went by and still no payment or contact from buyer (who has 100% feedback, unsure if it was a bot or what? as I said, I'm unfamiliar with the inner workings of eBay). I then messaged the buyer again a week later saying that due to lack of contact, and out of country shipping that I am cancelling the order. eBay now is waiting for the customer to confirm that they were refunded (wtf, they never paid). It's been almost a week again and still no contact from the buyer. I know NOW that I should have went to the resolution center first, but hindsight is 20/20.

The rep was pretty rude and insisted the average consumer should know to keep their return address updated, I am 100% responsible, and ebay is fine with providing old information as long as the seller is happy getting his money back. He suggested going over to the apartment building where I used to live, but there's no office there or anything, it's not a great neighborhood, when I lived there if a UPS package got left at my door, with my address, I probably would have kept it too.

Should I take this up with UPS? I feel like they're not really responsible because they delivered it to the address on the label. Anyway how do I find the tracking info? Or what else should I do?

Ebay,Ebay sucks,"I started using eBay about a month ago to sell my Xbox 360 as well as all the games and controllers. I set my starting price as $78.00 auction style with no reserve. 7 days go by and my final price is $187.50, the outcome was a lot better than I thought it would be. About an hour goes by and I'm still awaiting payment, so I message the guy and ask when he's going to pay and all that. He responds and says he'll pay within 10 days. I say ok. 5 days later he messages me asking about the condition and I say it works fine. 10 days go by and no final purchase yet. I wait another day, then I message him twice, and send him a reminder. No response. After 13 days I send him a message telling him I'm going to relist in 2 days if I don't get a response. He finally responds and tells me he doesn't want it anymore. Alright, I was prepared, seeing I had to wait 13 days I was expecting this. 
So I relist, only this time I put a reserve of 150 on it. 7 days(today) go by and the winning bid is $177.50. ok, that's not bad. I get a message about 15 minutes after the end of the auction ""I apologize my son got onto my phone, bid on this item. I had no idea this was going on until the auction had ended, I am not interested in this item.""

To add onto that I had sold a game separately and yesterday I guess the buyer refunded it. I made sure it worked before I shipped, I had probably played it 3 times since originally purchasing it 3 years ago from GameStop.

Will people really go to a store that may have a tire, then a handmade item, then a hat, then a lawn mower blade, etc?

Ebay,Stop the horror stories - Lets MASS contact eBay,"Seriously guys,

just search for ""below standard defect rate ebay ban"" or similar keywords and you will find tons of recent horror stories of perfectly legitimate and experienced sellers (some of them have been around since 2006-2007) getting banned thanks to this new *defective* defect rate system.

This is serious stuff, there are people out there who quit their jobs and made a living with this website, raised their families thanks to it, or simply used it to boost an otherwise low and insufficient income, who now are being forced out by this poorly thought system.

Defect rate is extremely hard to control, some buyers are just plain dumb and will open cases, leave negative or neutral feedback, give low DSR, request partial or full refunds for the most stupid things.
Most of them are also completely oblivious of how much damage they're doing to us, potentially putting us out of business and ruining our financial lives. 
 
eBay customer service is notoriously poor, and won't help much in most cases, despite all the fuss on the website about ""seller protection"".

This has to stop, the system is obviously flawed and is currently punishing tons of innocent sellers. 
And the only way to stop it is to let eBay notice that there IS actually a problem. If we keep silent they'll never know.

So please, once for all *lets mass contact eBay about it - thoroughly describe to them how the new system is flawed, provide some examples of innocent/experienced sellers getting banned, just do anything and lets at least try to do something to stop this nonsense policy*!

I have no USPS tracking number, but I know exactly what time it was delivered (What?!). I can't file a USPS claim online because of this.

I have gathered this information: the usual mailman wasn't working that day, he usually leaves stuff with the manager. The new guy just left the stuff in the lobby. That's not delivery to my address! The building is open so he should have taken an extra few minutes to go to my actual door. The thief who stole my package also stole two other packages from other tenants.

Ebay,Ebay told me they would record tracking info. Now they say I won't get refund b/c didn't submit tracking.,"So I got a label from ebay for a return. Here is what it said in the original email:

""We'll enter the tracking information from the label into your purchase history page. Once we have confirmation that the item has been delivered, we'll refund you within 6 days for the cost of the item plus original shipping (as long as the seller hasn't issued you a refund). If you decide not to use our prepaid shipping label, you'll need to pay for shipping and add tracking information to your case.""

Okay, so essentially they said WE WILL record tracking - AKA pest0 does not need to record tracking. 

But then, I got an email from them saying that I need to submit tracking information by March 8 or I won't get a refund. I tried to re-open the link leading to the label to get the tracking information but a message popped up saying:

""Error: Label is unavailable -- all the packages of the shipment have been sent to the destination address.""

This essentially proves that it was delivered, and there is no way to enter tracking information. Ebay literally went back on their word and now I'm out a very large amount of money.

Ebay,Giving buyer's Feedback,"Maybe it is just me, but I get (almost) daily messages from buyers that are absolutely **livid** that I haven't yet left them feedback.  I could understand if these were new ""eBayers"" or sellers who needed the feedback. I could also understand if the customer had other problems with the transaction. However, 9 times out of 10 the buyers will have feedback that is over 300! Despite the clear displeasure in their messages, their feedback for the transaction is always excellent, often glowing. To have experienced, apparently satisfied customers consistently sending me vicious messages over my delay in leaving feedback seems bizarre. I'm just wondering: Am I doing something wrong? Are most eBayers like this? Is there some reason that buyers with lots of feedback would want feedback ASAP?

I know leaving feedback is important, but I thought I'd get some *feedback* from other seller's regarding how you leave feedback and any experience you may have with buyers asking for feedback. 

My practice is to leave feedback on the Sunday evening after tracking shows the item delivered. If a buyer messages me with a *polite* request to leave feedback, I will leave them feedback. When I get the nastygrams, I usually apologize for the delay and let them know that we leave feedback in bulk on Sundays due to the sheer volume of transactions.",14,2,2015-03-06,EBAY,0.30671530961990356,0.6677202582359314,0.025564422830939293
Ebay,Buyer with 0 Feedbacks bought my iPhone. Should I be worried ?,"I'm an iPhone seller, and I just sold an iPhone 5 for a decent price (390$ CAD). The buyer, is an eBay member since ***April 2011***, but has 0 feedbacks.

The street address is ***""Confirmed""***.

The sender of the payment is ***""Unregistered""***

For some reason, it feels quite weird.

This effectively sums up my last three years. I've gone from a sense of accomplishment from learning something new and earning some extra cash to a feeling of despair as I look around the house at all the stuff I've collected that I haven't had the time to list.

Ebay,"Seller sold me fake Timberland boots, can I get a return?","I recently just received some new ""Timberlands"". They were selling fro $120 which should have been my red flag, but I put in an offer for $100. The pictures seemed to look a little ""off"" in the pictures but I went ahead with them.

When I got them in hand I knew I'd been jipped. The first thing was that the logos on the side weren't dark at all. The almost faded into the paper. The second thing was the shoe tag with the Timberland logo was off center and faded also. After further inspection there was a thread coming a loose, so I pulled it and all the threads just came popping off. 

Is it seller fraud if the dude said they were 100% authentic, and can I get my money back? I will try to post photos for whomever might look at this thread and need to see if they have fake Timberlands.

Ebay,"Customer bought five of the same product from me, left me five negative feedback remarks today saying they are counterfeit.","To be fair, I don't know if the items are counterfeit or not. I was lead to believe that they are not, which is why I bought them. They are [metal encased knives](http://i.imgur.com/a639B8n.jpg) called a CardSharp, and I wasn't aware that there was actually a legitimate or ""real"" CardSharp, but it turns out there is and they never made one with colored metal casings.

So today I log into eBay and I have five negative feedbacks saying ""COUNTERFEIT Cardsharp3 Knives - no such real product &amp; all same serial number"". Up until today I had 100% positive feedback, with most remarks talking about fast shipping and excellent customer service. I immediately removed the listing for those knives and contacted the buyer to say that I would refund all of their money and look into the knives. If they are counterfeit, then I am screwed out of the money because I won't sell them. That's fine. I was ignored by them, so I called the phone number. They are a group called ""The Counterfeit Report"" out of California, and apparently this is what they do. I called a second number that I found online and the guy yelled at me about calling him at 8pm and then hung up on me.

Next I called eBay and was told that even though the buyer never contacted me before leaving the multiple negs there is nothing that they can do. I am very upset. I was set to be rated as a top seller on March 20th, and that's likely gone now. Not to mention that any potential buyer will see five negatives screaming ""COUNTERFEIT"" as soon as they look at my page. Do I have any recourse at all here? I feel like I have tried to take all of the right steps to resolve this and these people just want to plaster me with negatives. I mean, if they are after people selling counterfeit goods, why are they going after a dude and his fiance selling 20 knives that they didn't even get a very good deal on? There are people on eBay selling TONS of counterfeits.

Ebay,Buyer reports item as defective one week (based on reported delivery date) after warranty period has expired.,"Okay so I sold a PC motherboard on ebay and I know it was working prior to having shipped it because I ran it for several days because I was debating on whether I should keep it for myself.
Anyway I get this message yesterday from the buyer when he opened a dispute. 

**After ordering all components for desktop, we cannot get this motherboard to post. Replaced other components to try to figure out if some other component wasn t working however, it still didn t post. Items are in same condition as received. Spent a lot of time on this. Please help us resolve.**

And I responded with:

**Are you implying that the board doesn't power on at all? Or does it boot up to a certain point? My apologies, but I ran this board for several days prior to selling. Mainly because I had debated keeping it for myself. Have you tried looking up the user manual or resetting the CMOS settings? Another thing is that if you are using a different CPU than what I shipped it with, you may have to flash to the latest BIOS for the board to see it. My return policy is 14 days. and you are one week past that date (based on USPS reported delivery date) Unfortunately I cannot refund this item.**

Ebay,Buyer is claiming item is defective but won't provide any proof.,"So back in February I listed up a phone of mine that I had gotten 6 months prior (I upgraded to a Nexus 6).  I listed it with a 2nd battery that I had for it because it was a promotion for the phone when I got it, a battery charging cradle, a case, and original box, papers and charger.

Buyer messaged me a week later saying the phone won't hold a charge past 50% (for the record they only mention ONE battery), which doesn't make sense to me.  I had that phone at 100% before I put it in the packaging to get it to them, and it was working fine up until that day.  

They insist it won't charge higher than 50 and also claim they took it to a Tmobile store and they told my buyer to return it (I put no returns on my listing), but they didn't have any proof of them ever saying that. I insisted that their is nothing wrong with the phone to them and I found it hard to believe what they said is actually happening because they never once showed me proof.

They then put in a claim to eBay that it is defective and they want a refund, to which I told them (reluctantly) that if they paid for shipping to get it to me, I will try to 'fix the problem', if I fix it, I will send it back out of my pocket, and if I can't I will refund them the full amount and the shipping it took to get to me.  They countered by saying they wanted a 30 day guarantee that it will be working and that I pay shipping both ways.  I told them I would give them the 30 day but not the shipping.

Again they refused and now won't answer my messages.  I let the day come and go before eBay will step in, and now I wait to see what will happen.

I am worried I will lose and they will get their money back, and that I won't get the phone I sold back.

Ebay,"Refunded a buyer, who is refusing to return the item because ""Ebay says he doesn't have to."" Is this right?","Sold an expensive item for $800.

Buyer refuses to return the item, claiming that, since he filed a dispute for the item being misrepresented, and Ebay pulled the money, he isn't obligated to return the item or the money.

I'm pretty sure that isn't how it works- If I clearly stated that I wanted the item back, isn't he required to send it? 

I know I have no backup from Ebay on this- I'm probably out a lot of money AND an item I still owe money on. I should have offered a small, partial refund, or waited until the item was actually shipped to allow the full refund, but he was claiming that he wanted to keep it no matter what. On a legal standpoint, however, is he correct? Since Ebay automatically pulled the money from Paypal, and initiated the refund, can he just keep the item?

I finally got fed up and called eBay support a few minutes ago.  They lady didn't know what she was talking about, but the second my account was pulled up on their end the error magically went away (and made me look stupid, as well as draw attention to my technically banned ecig listings)

Ebay,Considering the Global Shipping Program. Just some questions.,"I currently don't ship anywhere outside the US.  I've been hearing about this Global shipping program that pretty much acts like those forwarding services some foreign buyers use.  Even though the cost is high for buyers, so I heard, I figured it's better than having no international buyers.  
  
So anyway, just a few questions.  When I ship it to the hub, do they examine and repackage the item and record it so the buyer can't pull a switcheroo?  Or do they simply place my box in a bigger box?  I know I'm only responsible for shipping to the hub, but if the buyer can still pull the inr or nad bullshit then I'm not so sure how worth it it would be.

Ebay,"scammer cancelled item after shipping, inconsistent directions from eBay reps","I sold a camera recently and received a message this morning saying that the transaction was cancelled this morning. It appears that someone 'hacked' the buyer's account. It was supposed to be delivered yesterday, but I had signature required which stopped it from delivering. 

The message from eBay says at the bottom to contact the shipping company and stop the shipment, which I did through USPS. After contacting the post office I called eBay to understand the situation. The first rep I spoke with could barely speak English and started spouting some dribble about my IP address has changed and that I should contact the post office to direct them to deliver the package anyway. He said that it was a mistake on eBay's part and I need to deliver it. This didn't sit well with me so I asked him to email me confirmation of what he told me so I would have it in writing since I have been burned in the past. 

When I was finished with him I checked my email to see he sent a summary about how to change your eBay password and nothing about the conversation we had. I called back immediately to verify his directions and got a well spoken rep that told me the exact opposite that the first one said. She said that they were in the process of refunding the buyer's money and that their account was hacked. If I had listened to the first guy I would be out of my money and my item. I verified again with her and asked her to have the previous guy retrained because he didn't speak well of on topic and gave horrible advice/directions that would have cost me nearly $1000. 

Always verify what the phone reps tell you if it doesn't sound consistent. I would have been screwed if I didn't.

Ebay,"First time returning items on eBay, seller disputes claim, what are my odds of a positive outcome?","I've been a fairly inactive eBay user, never selling and occasionally buying relatively small things.  Recently, I had bought a used phone from what appeared to be an ordinary person (not an eStore) to replace my dead G2.

Shipping was prompt, my payment was prompt, everything was smooth sailing until a few days after receiving the phone.  It had begun to, for lack of a better word, have seizures where the screen would swipe erratically on it's own while simultaneously being unresponsive to the touch.  A few days later, it had begun being occasionally unresponsive, to the point that I performed a factory reset, as well as look up anything else I could do to fix it without damaging it.  At this point, I started to get a bad feeling about the purchase, but I kept with it, realizing that it was a *used* item and sometimes used items have some wear and tear.  After almost two weeks of increasing issues, however, it finally began giving me a warning upon startup, saying it couldn't locate the SIM card, although the SIM was secured in it's specified location.

It was at this point that I attempted to contact the seller, to try and figure out if this was an issue that they had encountered before sending it off.  After a few days without response, I informed the seller that, since I hadn't received word back from them, I intended to return the item for a refund.  Soon after, I was prompted to leave a review about my purchase, which I did.

About a week later, I receive correspondence from the seller, telling me they were on vacation outside the US and couldn't send/receive any sort of email while they were gone.  They were also skeptical about the condition in which the phone had arrived to me, as well as informing me that the address given for return postage (provided by eBay) was no longer their address.  This last part is important, because the seller told me that there was a chance they weren't going to get the phone back now, so instead of working with me, they were going to dispute my claim through eBay.  Later in the same email, they were ""willing to refund $25 for me to remove the review I had left on their page"" (it wasn't scathing, but it did point out the iniquities with this specific situation), since it ruined their 100% seller rating.

I have no intention to ruin this seller's reputation or business and I want to believe them about being unable to respond, but I don't feel as though this situation can be made right by a simple 50% refund, therefore I left the review up and am leaving it in eBay's hands.

My question for this subreddit is, since you all seem to have a firm grasp on how things work in eBay, do I appear to be in the wrong here?  Does it seem like I have a good case for a refund, or am I just pissing in the wind by not accepting the 50% and rolling the dice?  I know that all you have to go on is my word, but based on that, do I stand a chance of receiving my full refund or do I just look like a sleaze for trying to protect myself?

Sorry for the text wall, I'm just new to this sort of ""conflict resolution"" and I was hoping for a little outside insight before a judgement is made.  Thanks to all who read, and a special thanks to those who respond.

Ebay,"Ignored and cheated by seller, eBay proving to be no help.","In December 2014 I bought an item from a seller with a great reputation that I assumed I would have no trouble with. The item was a Playstation 3 Drum Controller for Rock Band 3, which set me back £72.99. The item arrived about a week later, and upon opening it I found that it was faulty (the red pad was completely unresponsive, tested this on multiple systems). I opened a return request and was emailed a prepaid returns label. Packaged the item up, attached the label, then upon trying to deposit it at the post office I was told that the label was invalid due to the size of the item.

I contacted the seller, asking them for an alternative way to return it to them, and they told me to find a courier to carry the item. Having never used a courier, the best I could find was quoted at ~£20, but when I suggested it to the seller they said they would not refund a return that expensive. I asked them for an alternative courier that they would approve of in an email on the 20th of January, which got no response. I re-sent the email on the 8th of February, still no response.

From there I called eBay so that they could resolve the issue, and they refused to help, saying that they were closing the case because I didn't send the item back with the original returns label. I tried to explain that this was impossible because the label was invalid, but they ignored that.

On the 26th of February I emailed the seller again, as I had eventually found (with help) a courier that would take the item for ~£10, and they told me to send the item back. The item is now back with them, but they are refusing to refund me because ""eBay already ruled in their favour"", despite the fact that eBay only ruled in their favour because the representatives I spoke to ignored important information that was given to them. I have just emailed the seller again re-explaining the situation and asking for my refund yet again, and spoken to someone from eBay who told me I would be contacted by the appeals team, but I find it difficult to put any faith in that.

I feel like I'm being cheated out of my hard-earned money here, and both companies are putting up such a wall that it's impossible to communicate with anyone, let alone make them understand the situation.

Is there any advice anyone can give me here? Any legal recourse in this situation? All I want is a fair refund.

Edit: Thanks to everyone so far for the advice, been on the phone to eBay repeatedly today, eventually got someone to contact the seller requesting they refund my money (with a copy sent to me to prove they've actually followed through this time), so hopefully some success will come from that.

 I then contact the seller and I mentioned the dent and damage and other issues. He denied all the issues i had with the unit, stated that they had run a full battery of tests and we had to ship the item back for a refund and I would be charged a 15% restocking fee if they find no flaws as I mentioned. He suggested the damage was from shipping and not their fault. So I then review the listing pictures and there it is, but so obscured you would not see it unless you looked for it.


 I then point it out to him and other issues, he did not address them. So I left negative feedback. Now he starts calling my home number and sending me e-mail outside eBay trying to contact me. How he got my phone number I don't even know. By now Microcenter verified the HDD has bad sectors and needed replacement, I ordered recovery media through them and installed the new drive. 


The machine worked great other than the fan problem, but it cost me about $100 to fix. I reply to one of his emails and explain I've had the machine repaired but would prefer a partial refund for the cosmetic issues not mentioned as other than the HDD there doesn't seem to be a problem. He replies stating he can't do more than $40 but I have to change the feedback. So I reply to his email and send him the same message on eBay asking him to work with me some and meet me in the middle I was asking for $75. I said I would modify the feedback if we could come to a reasonable compromise.

 He then opens a case against me for extortion, which was complete horseshit and got the negative feedback removed. I then contact eBay and they say they can't help me because I've modified the item... The fan is now failed and the machine is unusable now as it overheats. The seller doesn't want to do anything and considers the issue over and doesn't want to give the partial refund. I cant return it even though I stated to eBay I can put the old HDD back in. I cant spend MORE fixing this thing... the whole situation is a nightmare. What do I do?",15,5,2015-03-13,EBAY,0.19151462614536285,0.7806792855262756,0.027806075289845467
Ebay,Question about lots of suspicious breaks the last few weeks (UK),"Tl;dr joined a Facebook group that bought from my online UK ebay store. Didn't give them heavy discounts they blocked me and now there's a lot of suspicious glass breakage. 


I sell candles in the UK, one of the members of a Facebook group found me and after talking for a while invited me to the page. I figured it wouldn't be bad because I've never had any issues with breakage or missing products. I had a lot of issues suddenly spring up after joining the group and they were demanding coupons because they were such a ""huge following"" they accounted for roughly 10 percent of my sales so I gave them a 10 percent code less coupon to use and they demanded more, I politely said no and then issues started springing up. I was blocked from the group and now I keep having products not received or candles broken. They are refusing the send the candles back because Royal Mail doesn't take glass and they send pictures of completely shattered candles.

Ebay,Won auction at $4.74. Paid immediately. Buyer responds days later via email saying it was BIN and I owe $260.76. Won't ship. Pissed.,"I ran across an old, but not rare, book on eBay.  It lacked a photo and was a 99 cent auction with free shipping.  I ended up winning it for $4.74.  I paid the buyer as soon as I won.

Days go by.  No communication from the seller so I ask politely what the status is with my item.  I get the following response via email, not through the correct eBay channels:

""Was posted as ""Buy now"" price of $265.00 with free shipping. Please remit $260.76 or request a refund.""

I'm not sure if the seller thinks I am an idiot, genuinely believes they had a BIN on there, or realized they screwed up and sold a valuable book for nothing.  The book, by the way, sells on eBay once or twice a month for an average of $40.  Yeah, I got a good deal but the $260 price is insane.

The seller doesn't have a case here.  Anyone can click on the closed auction and see the starting and winning bids.  There wasn't a BIN.  Even if there was, BIN isn't the same thing as a reserve.  

I've replied back to the seller a few times with no response.  I'll be able to open a case with eBay tomorrow but I don't care about the $4.74 refund, I want the book I won.

I've looked into this and I realize eBay can't and won't make the seller ship me the item.  The Uniform Commercial Code has protections for buyers in auctions, but I would have to file a claim in California and I'm in Kentucky.  

According to the U.C.C., I could file an injunction demanding the seller not sell or transfer the book.  I could meanwhile try to find the same book in similar condition and purchase it, with the court charging the seller the price of the book I purchased.  The court could also order the seller to send me the book.  I could also file in small claims for the book or the value of the book plus legal costs.  Again, none of this is really an option since I can't afford to pay an attorney in California to file for me.  If I had jurisdiction here in Kentucky, I'd do it myself.

Anyway, this sucks.  Anyone have ideas on other ways I can try to get this seller to send me the book I won?",0,2,2015-03-13,EBAY,0.062110885977745056,0.9066623449325562,0.031226690858602524

Ebay,Buyer lists incorrect shipping address and won't respond back.,"Hi everyone

I am having an issue getting a hold of a buyer who purchased something from a BIN I had listed on March 10th.  On March 11th I was getting ready to send out his package when eBay wouldn't let me print it because his address was too long.  I did some searching on this subreddit and one suggestion was to just change the address to the second line.  The issue in this case is that there is no discernible place where it could be cut off at.  To me, it looks like two addresses typed together and when I tried to google street view what I thought his address might be it took me to an alley.  I called eBay at that point and they said to wait and try and get a hold of him.  Its been a couple of days now and I have messaged him everyday, but I am wondering at what point do I cancel the order?

Ebay,Buyer wants a return--unsure what to do.,"I recently sold an iPod on ebay. The iPod was in prime condition and had barely been used. The buyer received it earlier last week and left me positive feedback for it. However--several days later, they are now saying that the iPod has stopped working and are trying to return it. I have a no-returns policy, but unfortunately it seems that doesn't really mean anything.

I sent them a message with basic information about charging, performing a soft reset, etc--and have yet to receive a response. Although it has only been an hour or so. I find it very difficult to believe the iPod spontaneously stopped working considering it was in excellent condition--and I think they're either doing something wrong, or are trying to scam me.

Ebay,"USPS Priority Mail insurance claim denied, help me format final appeal","Hello.  I'm a very small eBay seller just getting started.  I posted a question a few weeks ago about problems with a USPS insurance claim and a motorcycle headlight I sold through eBay.  The glass of the headlight was cracked during shipment, but I had it insured and my buyer was extremely understanding and patient.  Got some advice from /u/mamashlo and filed my claim right away. 

When my buyer sent me a best offer for $175.00 shipped, I had $35.00 marked for shipping and handling costs.   I was only able to insure for the $140.00, it would not let me insure for the cost shipping and handling fees when I was purchasing the insurance.  Actual cost of shipping was $7.36 + $3.30 insurance = $10.66 total. 

I sent in my claim for $140 because that is what I was able to insure it for.  It made no sense to me that I was paying for a service that broke my package but  I was going to eat the $35 as a learning experience.  They sent me a check for $50 within a week, and I appealed within another week.  I just received the letter today denying my first appeal.  According to the letter,  ""the amount claimed exceeds the amount of coverage provided.  The coverage amount is $50.00""  

This leads me to my main question.  I shipped USPS Priority, which comes with $50.00 insurance built in.  Originally I thought I received $50.00 because the assembly of the headlight still holds value, but this makes me think I may just be receiving the standard Priority Mail coverage.  Did I not do enough to prove I bought and paid for insurance on this package during my claim and appeal?  I used the cut off part from the eBay shipping label printout.

This is an album explaining my claim and appeal along with some pictures of their letter and what I am using for proof.  I can also put the text of my appeal in the comments if anyone needs to see that.  I will also show an recently SOLD listing that has the same headlight valued at $125.00.

If anyone can check it out and offer some advice on how I should word and format my final appeal I would really appreciate it.  This is my first time going through the claims process so I would like to learn the best process, and this money is important to me.",11,4,2015-03-16,EBAY,0.027464140206575394,0.9205689430236816,0.05196691304445267

Ebay,Seller wants me to return item. Need help.,So I received an item today and before it was even delivered the seller started sending me messages telling me to send it back and how they didn't want to sell it in the first place. For the whole day I've been receiving messages about them wanting it back and they keep flipping between wanting it back and leaving it. First of all I payed a pretty big price for the item and have NO intentions on sending it back at all.

Ebay,Bought a phone that's shipped chipped despite being listed NEW - seller offers refund and I have sent in the phone.

I contacted the seller and he quickly told me it's his bad and offered an exchange. He first sent a return label directly to my personal e-mail, and I told him I prefer to do everything within EBay and using Ebay's return label so I don't risk anything. He says ok, and so I sent him the phone using eBay label - I then realized I forgot to pack the car charger that came along with it. I am planning to buy from him again (it's cheap, and he did realize it's his mistake) and tells him to not ship the car charger on this order, but is it possible for him to refuse my refund? I notice that after searching a bit that once a return is delivered eBay is pretty much on buyer's side (which some scam buyers are taking advantage of), and I am somewhat taking advantage of that but also asking him not to send me a another one (which cancels out).

Ebay,Small question about sending game code electronically (worried about being scammed),"I recently had a bid settle for a little under two hundred dollars. It's my first sale on ebay. It's a limited edition electronic game card for unique perks in a popular online franchise. 

Considering it's just a card with a scratch-off code, I'm worried that the buyer will scratch it off, claim it was already scratched off when they recieved it, and then essentially defraud me for $200.
 
He also requested, as an additional comment, I could scratch it off myself and ebay message him the game code, and that this method is preferred over mailing. I want to do this, not only because I would save money and time, but because I'd like to honor the buyer's request. However, I am still worried he will use the code I send him and then claim to ebay that it didn't work.

He has a pretty extensive (around 100) buyer history with all positive comments. He does have one negative comment from selling when he didn't send an item to a payed buyer. I'm not sure if I should be worried about that.

How do I make sure I am not scammed? Is it safe to do as he requested? Does ebay tend to side with sellers in the case of game codes?

-----

edit: I did a bit of research, it seems like selling game codes themselves is against the TOS of ebay, while selling the card the code is printed on is allowed. In other words, I basically can't send him the code directly, I need to mail the card. It seems like because of this, it's the buyer's risk for the card to be scratched off because I'll have done my duty as the seller to send the card. However, I may still be at risk because I advertised unscratched in listing and posted pictures proving it was. 

I guess they could claim it didn't come in the condition it was advertised, and I'm still worried about that.",7,4,2015-03-17,EBAY,0.09334193170070648,0.8777644634246826,0.028893612325191498
Ebay,Scammed $1710 by kazakhstan buyer thanks to ebay's unfair policies.,"I'm not a professional ebay seller. I've been a casual buyer/seller since 1999. I use eBay about as much as I use Amazon. Here's what happened.

* Sept 2014, I listed my 15"" MacBook Pro, I chose ""standard international shipping"" with ship time as ""varies"".
* Sept 2014, auction won by buyer (with high feedback score) from kazakhstan, paid for very quickly with Paypal.
* Sept 2014, I call ebay and as what steps I must take to make sure I'm covered in this transaction. They tell me to:

-insure the item
-take payment only from the listed paypal account
-ship only to registered/verified address on paypal account
-get delivery confirmation signature

* Sept 2014, I priced the shipping, which was really expensive from Canada to Kazakhstan. $500 for expedited shipping or $150 for 6-8 standard international shipping.

* Oct 2014, buyer goes back and forth with me over shipping, doesn't want to pay that much. Considered refunding/cancelling, but finally we decide to go ahead with the $150 6-8 week shipping option, about 2-3 weeks after the auction was won and paid for.
* Oct 15 2014, Buyer starts harassing me about shipping &amp; tracking numbers. I gave him tracking number. He messages me 5-6 times asking where the item is even though I just shipped it.
* Oct 25 2014, Buyer opens ""item not received claim."" 
* Oct 31 2014, I give ebay the tracking number.
* Nov 3 2014, Ebay **closes the dispute in his favor** and reimburses the buyer, even though it's only been 4 weeks from when it was shipped, and the tracking number showed **""In progress, estimated delivery time 2-4 weeks.""**
* Nov 9 2014, I file an appeal against the decision. I speak with a ""leader"" in the appeals department. She tells me that **he should not have been able to open the case because it wasn't 30 days since the item was shipped**, but they opened it anyway. She said that **if the item has not been received before the case is escalated (30 days) then they award the case to the buyer**. I asked her why can't they wait until the agreed on and quoted time of 6-8 weeks and then make the decision, instead of 4 weeks when the item is still in transit. She said they don't do that. **I asked why are we even allowed to sell items on ebay that have 6-8 week ship times if they know this loophole exists**, she had no answer. She says if the macbook arrives, the best they can do is send an email on my behalf and ask him nicely to pay me.
* Nov 26 2014, Delivery Confirmation in Kazakhstan, buyer received macbook. 
* Dec 2014, I follow up by email with eBay asking for resolution, no reply.
* Jan 2015, I call Ebay, asking why I can't contact the buyer anymore on eBay to ask him to pay me. She said **I'm only considered ""in transaction"" for 60 days** so I can't talk to the buyer. She says they will try to contact him **but they can't tell me if he replies for privacy reasons.**
* Jan 2015, I try Paypal Disputes, but they say their hands are tied by eBay. Paypal says they will email him and ask for him to pay me.
* Jan 2015, I send a paypal invoice, email him and have ebay and paypal email him. Obviously no reply.
* Feb 2015, I filed a chargeback with Visa saying this charge is not valid since the buyer received the item.
* March 2015, I lose the chargeback because eBay sent documentation saying they can charge my credit card whenever and whatever they want.


Anyone have any suggestions here? 

I noticed there is a class action lawsuit happening in California for this very issue:

http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/judge-rules-class-action-suit-against-ebay-and-paypal-may-proceed-081414.html

I'm in Canada and can't join that lawsuit... but I'm hoping that some other sellers who have been scammed like this can give me some tips on what to do from here. Or possibly, someone from ebay or paypal can help me out.

I don't understand how I can sell something on eBay, following all of the rules that eBay reps tell me to follow to make sure I'm protected, the buyer gets the MacBook Pro in the time I quoted him and that he agreed to, and I STILL get stuck with a chargeback.

Ebay,"Negligent buyer initiates return, never replies, I ask eBay to step in, they refund buyer at no fault to me but I never got my item back..?","As much as eBay says ""Don't issue a refund until the you receive the returned item"" I don't understand why they did that.

Basically I sold a game case, manual, and inserts. This game sells for 60-70. The case and inserts sold for 24.50. Not for some reason this buyer thought that even with reading the title that said ""Case and all inserts ONLY"" the game was included. There were no pictures of the game. I don't blame the buyer because this happens all the time but usually they catch it mid auction and ask me to retract the bid. Worst case scenario someone buys wins the item then asks after they win to cancel (why can't people read?)

Anyway, I get the return request saying they felt like they've been scammed no disc blah blah blah. Like not only did the title say it was case and inserts only but it sold for $25. That's the FMV of the case and inserts. This personally honestly thought they got this highly sought after game for $25? So I told them that I would take the return if they paid the return shipping. Because why should I pay return shipping due to their negligence? 5 days pass and no response from buyer... okay.

I ask eBay to step in. By the end of the day they issue the buyer their refund and they find me to not be at fault. But where is my case and inserts at? Am I even going to get it back?",16,6,2015-03-18,EBAY,0.05713733285665512,0.90850430727005,0.034358348697423935

Ebay,I received a counterfeit item and have a quick question.,"I received a counterfeit item from a seller (100% for 53).  the item was $210 but MSRP was $269, so it seemed reasonable.  I contacted the manufacturer and gave them the serial number and now have an email from them confirming it is fake.  I contacted the seller, he/she said they would give me a full refund when they receive the item back. now:  
  
1.) do I still need to file a return claim with ebay?  can I trust this seller to give me a refund without doing so?  
2.) The box has compression damage, and the item had obviously been removed and sprayed with cleaning solution (had 'windex' type residue, said he removed for pictures).  this makes me think this isn't the first time this item was returned to him for being fake.  he also had two available when I purchased, meaning one is still available for some sap (like me) to get tricked.  
3.) is there any validity to the claims I could get in trouble myself for sending something counterfeit in the mail, in this case?

Ebay,"Tried to return an item, but the item has been circling around my state for several days, and now the delivery status is ""Not Updated.""","So I received a package in which one of the figurines was damaged. Distraught, I contacted the seller, who was happy to replace it if I sent out first.

I printed out the return label from eBay, slapped it onto the box with the figurine, and dropped it off at my school's post office.


I look into the status of the package, and I see that it's sent back to NJ. Fine, I thought to myself. I've had packages that went from Philadelphia to NJ to the destination area. However, a couple of days later I noticed that the package was still in NJ, and not just sitting in one area - It circulated around different post offices in NJ. It would be sent from one post office in NJ to another, and then back again.

Ebay,Seller trying to issue a refund....,"So this is my first post in this forum and I am writing this in the hopes that someone can help me out or give me some advice.
Recently I bought an item on eBay that was listed as authentic, I bought it, got it, and everything checked out. After a few weeks I decided to re-list this item in the hopes of making a little profit( I am a broke first year uni student). I am a relatively new seller but I had never had any problems, until this transaction. So after selling this item(that I bought on eBay), the buyer paid and I shipped it out. After a week, the buyer filed a claim asking for a refund claiming that it was fake. So I decided to issue a refund, and asked him to return it. This is where it gets interesting....
The buyer, for three days, demanded that I refund him first and than he would ship it out. He also said that he has done these returns before and he knows what he is doing, this is where my suspicions began. I spoke to an ebay employee and they advised me to wait until he returned the item before issuing a refund. I passed this information on to him and also decided to ask him why he thought it was fake. His reason was that ""THE BARCODE IS NOT TOUCHING THE DATE, AND ON HIS REAL ONES IT IS!"" I had a picture of the barcode on the listing and he still decided to buy it!!! Now I am certain that my item is authentic because I have messaged the original seller and he is certain it is authentic, as do I and I believe the reason this seller issued a claim was because he wanted to take advantage of the fact that I am a new seller. This buyer has admitted to: owning another pair of this item, already doing ""many refunds before"", tried to assure me to return his money first before receiving the item and had carelessly bided on my item, despite the listing showing pics of the barcode. 
I will no longer be able to return this item to the original seller because I am no longer the buyer being covered, this transaction will put me at a loss of $300 because of a dishonest buyer.
After almost two weeks from issuing the claim, he shipped the item. What are my chances of winning this case? I cannot afford to loose $300 now. Please help.",22,3,2015-03-20,EBAY,0.05951131880283356,0.9052561521530151,0.03523252531886101
Ebay,"Need advice, buyer claims item not received.","I recently flipped some Forza V Xbox One download codes that I found cheap on another site.  I listed as 'buy it now' and when I received payment I immediately sent the codes via email to their paypal email and by ebay message.  The very next day the £25 that they spent was put on hold in my PayPal and the buyer claimed the item was not sent.

I have not contacted the buyer beyond sending them the codes.  I have uploaded the following to the resolution centre:

* Screen cap of my email to the buyer with the codes (showing the time sent)
* Screen cap of the ebay message to the buyer with the codes (showing the time sent)
* Screen cap of the email receipt proving that I had bought a Forza V game code.
* Screen cap of the code itself on the website I'd bought it from (CDKeys) to prove it matched the one sent.
* Screen cap of a chat with Xbox customer service confirming that the codes are as yet unused and fully active.
* A note describing things from my side.

The buyer has been an ebayer for a couple of weeks and is listed as being from Austria (although their paypal has a UK shipping address)  They have about 6 positive feedback, many of which provided by the same seller.  I have been an EBay member since 2007 with 100% positive feedback in 88 transactions.

Ebay,"Seller wants more money after I paid ""Buy it Now"" price","This morning I clicked the ""Buy it Now"" option to order a Star Wars graphic novel with some significant wear.

This book belongs to my son. 

Is there anyway you would be willing to pay the appropriate price?""

I take exception to the implication that I somehow screwed them on the deal. There were a few other listings for the same book for anywhere from $10 - $60 in mint condition. But I'm not a collector. I just wanted to read some Star Wars comics. 

I paid the price listed. Am I obligated to do anything more?

Ebay,Missed TRS status because of a sale in limbo - will it update?,"Let's cut straight to it. I ended up with a 89.19% tracking uploaded in time for the last evaluation (March 20th). 33 out of 37 transactions hit the criteria. However, when I check the trending data I have 36 transactions. Which gives me a 91%. I assume this confusion might be caused by a sale that occurred on the 19th with tracking uploaded and shipped on the 20th. This would then give me a 34 out of 37 which is still above a 90%. I've only missed out on three uploads in time so I'm not sure why it is showing two different numbers. Also, I've uploaded 100% tracking up its only showing as 97% - missing one transaction. 

With all of this I assume I actually did hit the TRS numbers but it just hasn't updated correctly. Is this something that will automatically update? Should I call eBay? Or am I screwed and have to wait until next month?

Ebay,Why can't all customers be like this?,"A week ago I sold a fairly expensive haircut machine to a buyer. It all went smoothly until he received the item. The item arrived with a broken switch.

Now here is the good part. 

First of all, he sends me a message without opening a case. I wish everyone did that. In the message he write that he's not looking for a refund, but rather an exchange (helps alleviate the suspicion that he's not just trying to return a different broken one). He knew it wasn't my fault and that it came still sealed, so I had no idea it was broken. He even offered to pay return shipping since there was free shipping on the item to begin with.

Anyways, after a few back and forths, we agree to an exchange, he pays for return shipping and ships the item that day. He didn't even open a case in order so that I should avoid the defect.

I know some of you will say I'm being too trusting, but we spoke a lot, plus there were lots of pictures involved, including post office receipts, etc. You can usually feel if something is off, and it doesn't seem to be here.


TL;DR Buyer got a broken item, knew it wasn't my fault, paid for return shipping out of their own pocket and helped me avoid a defect.

&gt; My point was, I might bid if I could see the product better. I can't tell if its OEM or aftermarket, made in japan or china or usa, anything like that. If the pictures were better, I could make an informed decision.

Ebay,"How to, as a seller, not have to face return issues?","So I've become a lot more active on eBay recently, and one problem I've kind of feared is people saying that the item is damaged and asking for a return or a swap in item (When in reality they've ordered the item(s) just to swap their damaged ones out for essentially free). 


For example, if I were to sell my PS3 (Assuming that I checked beforehand and it worked completely fine, and I shipped it to where it arrives to the buyer in the same condition listed), what could I do in a case where the buyer states that the console is broken and demands that I give a refund or another PS3?

Ebay,"Buyer disappeared after winning auction. Then finally claimed all of her credit cards were ""compromised"" and she couldn't pay.","I opened an Unpaid Item Case against the Buyer in eBay after the events that transpired above, but now I'm feeling a little guilty and wondering if perhaps I was a jerk on the off-chance that this person isn't lying about her credit cards being compromised. However, I find it very sketchy that after winning the auction, which lasted a week and which she bid on every day, she disappeared for several days without responding to messages. Then she finally responded to say she couldn't pay because of this identity issue.

I am a new seller and found this very unsettling because the item she won was very rare at the time it was being listed. Now several others have since popped up on eBay and it will be much harder for me to get as high of a price for it by the time I relist it.

So out of anger because of how much this hugely inconvenienced me and caused me to lose money, I opened an Unpaid Item Case. I figured that way, she can explain her excuse to eBay if she is unhappy with the flag on her account.

Ebay,Estimated shipping really screwed me - what should I do?,"I'm a pretty inexperienced seller, and made the mistake of allowing Ebay to estimate my shipping for me. I put in the exact size and weight of the box, and marked that I would send Priority with tracking via USPS. When I looked at my own listing, it estimated the shipping around $6, so I figured everywhere else in the country wouldn't be that much more. But as far as I know there was no way for me to see what it was showing other people. I got a few complaints about the shipping cost, but couldn't see what the problem was. So, only three people bid in my item, it sold for $2 more than the starting bid, which was very disheartening. But it charged them $50 for shipping! $50!! So obviously, everyone who viewed my item saw the ridiculous shipping and chose not to bid. I could probably have made more money if the shipping had been correct, i'm so upset with myself that I didn't just charge my own fixed price. (lesson learned there)
So, when I actually took it to the post office, they only charged me $15.01 for the label. In total, it probably cost me about $20 to send when you count the box and tape and stuff.

Here's my dilemma...I can't decide if I should refund the shipping overage. The buyer hasn't said anything to me about it, and they obviously chose to buy it knowing the shipping was $50, but I feel guilty and also don't want them to be angry/leave me a bad review when they see the big $15.01 sticker on the front.

But I really need the money. My buyer basically got a $1,200 item of mine just for $250, because I need the money that badly. But I feel like it's the right thing to do to refund the overage.

What would you do? Sorry it was so long, just trying to give a full picture.

Ebay,"Turning point in sales, what to do?","This is a good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless.  I usually average around 2 sales a day (my top day was 10 sales).  My items are fixed price listings and I buy and resell stock of them.  I'm essentially an importer.  I don't make a ton of money (I average around $500 total profit a month after all fees).  I use the money for hobbies and such.  I have a full-time job as a product manager for an electrical engineering company, so eBay will probably never replace it.

However, as of yesterday, my sales have exploded.  I went from an average of 2 sales a day to an average of 30.  This is on one of my products (a thermoplastic prototyping material).  I have a forecasting spreadsheet that keeps track of my run rates, re-order points and such, and I now have a problem.

Also, it's REALLY difficult keeping up with the shipments with my normal job.  2 packages a day is easy, but 30 is a lot harder.

I raised my prices, and that slowed down sales, but now people are just buying the larger quantities, which are a better deal.  Has anyone grown beyond what they can handle and hired someone?  I could pay someone $15-$20 an hour and still make out pretty darn good.  

tl;dr - sales increased to beyond what I can currently handle.  hire someone?",28,11,2015-03-23,EBAY,0.05102871358394623,0.8896099328994751,0.05936136469244957

Ebay,"So livid with eBay, Buyer lives in a country where we cannot ship to","So...

Another GREAT GREAT Monday with eBay.

Buyer buys a headlight from me. Everything is fine, We always use GSP for any out of the U.S. orders.

This specific item has GSP enabled and to be used, although for some reason it was not used and ""First class mail got chosen"" Something we don't offer for out of country. 

I still try to ship the guy his item to his requested address, Only issue is. USPS will not take an item over X amount of dimensional weight. That being 1/4 of what his items dimensional weight is.


SO I send the buyer a message letting him know I cannot send it and ask for a alternate address. Get no reply (I send 4 messages) before refunding him in full and send a cancel request with the reasoning ""Buyer lives in a country I do not ship to"" He instantly (within an hour) and denies my claim. Still doesn't respond to my messages...


**Now** a month later leaves me a negative feedback.



I'm on hold now and have been for an hour waiting for a supervisor. I was told I'm pretty much SOL because ""I agreed"" to send the item to the customer when he chose buy it now and because now I'm unable to send the item I have to deal with the Negative.

I explained that It was a issue with GSP as the item only has GSP for the intl shipping. She told me that GSP is unable to send to that country and that theres nothing they can do. So I question her in regards to why they even allowed the buyer to buy from me just to get no real response other than ""Sorry its our policy and after reviewing this case we are staying within those guidelines""",9,7,2015-03-23,EBAY,0.0608791820704937,0.9061663746833801,0.032954439520835876
Ebay,eBay Tax questions,"Hello, this is my first year buying goods and reselling them on eBay/Amazon and subsequently my first year to have to file taxes on those sales.

My first question is what things do I need to have together before I go to a tax professional say HR Block (if you have a better suggestion on who to use please feel free to throw that in as well, I am not opposed to filing them myself using a software if that is ""easy"" as well). I assume I need to have all of the receipts I have saved from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2015 along with my full year reports from both paypal and Amazon. Amazon is nice because they have a report that shows income minus expenses which includes shipping and fees, does eBay have this somewhere hidden as well? I sold around $7000 in product this year so I did not qualify for the paypal or Amazon 1099k (which I also don't know exactly what that is :/)  in short if somebody can tell me everything I need to calculate before going to see my tax guy please comment below.

Thank you so much!",9,6,2015-03-23,EBAY,0.03128357604146004,0.9284442663192749,0.04027212783694267
Ebay,Should I remove my bad feedback?,"I ordered a book from half.com to dropship to a customer after I had two orders come in at the same time from different venues. Seller on half.com cancels order saying that the item was not as described (new) and was missing dust jacket, had name plate, etc and listed it as an auction. As a result I had to scramble to find another copy to send. I left bad feedback because I feel like on half.com canceling orders is really easy (because half.com never punishes you) and happens far too often and makes the marketplace a joke beside amazon. Bad feedback, at least, will make sellers accountable if they choose to cancel often and be a warning to other buyers.

Seller wanted me to remove feedback. I ignored him, but two weeks later decided, OK, I'll remove it. I can't. I email seller. Seller sends me a stern email (not thankful or anything) detailing what I need to do-- it involves calling ebay, getting some sort of a pin number, etc. I guess I was willing to do it but I feel a little off put by his message.

I'm relatively new to Ebay in general. I ended up impulse buying something that was from a seller that only accepted Paypal payment. I tried to put my debit card information in, but Paypal give me the following:

&gt;We made a small charge to your credit card. The charge created a 4-digit code that can be found on your card statement. To begin using your card with PayPal, please enter the 4-digit code we sent to your credit card below.

Problem is, I have no idea what the hell they're talking about. They didn't send an email or anything of the sort.

Ebay,USPS said shipping label was printed but package never arrived at the facility.,"I ordered a high priced item on eBay on March 20th. The same day I received a tracking number for the item. The tracking didn't update and is still at ""The seller has provided a tracking number. The tracking status will be updated once the shipment reaches to carrier."" I called USPS yesterday to ask if that was a mistake or if they really didn't get the package. They said the latter. The item was supposed to arrive sometime between March 23-26. I had sent a message to the seller on the 24th and again last night with no response. What should my next steps be?

Edit: Thank for the responses and help! I opened a ""Item not received"" case and waiting until April 2 (date eBay said to wait for seller to respond) and see how that goes. The seller still haven't returned any of my messages and he got another negative feedback last night. Another buyer literally said, ""Thief"" and that they didn't get their item either.

Ebay,eBay refusing to refund final value fees from fraudulent bidder,"So a few months ago I listed an item with a value of around $700 and in the last few minutes of the auction it was bid up to $20,000 by a fraudulent bidder, leaving $750 of fees on my account. I opened a case in the resolution center (""I haven't received my payment yet"") and noted that the bidder was not genuine.

A few days later I got a message saying the users bids had been cancelled and any fees for the listing had been credited to my account (which they had not). After calling customer support multiple times and getting transferred/waiting on hold etc, each time getting told the amount will be credited and wasting a massive amount of my time. The fees are still on my account and I continue to get messages every couple of days warning me of the $750 in fees.

I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar? I'm raging so hard that the only option to contact support is to waste 30 minutes getting on the phone and getting transferred around to different departments when I could just spend 10 seconds writing an email. I don't really care about my account at this point and my only concern is eBay not destroying my credit rating by passing it to some sketchy debt collector which it appears they do.",9,8,2015-03-27,EBAY,0.10686826705932617,0.87095707654953,0.022174689918756485

Ebay,"Set up an ebay account for my dad - listed 1 item and now the account is suspended, with no reason.","Decided to set up an ebay account for my dad. He sells watches for a living, but he had an heart attack last week (thankfully he is ok) but he can't work for 6-8 weeks at least. So today we setup the ebay account so he can still keep busy at home and to earn some income.

I did so on his ipad with the ebay app, and listed a brand new watch with a BIN price. After listing he also signed in to ebay on his phone too.

Now, tonight we've received an email: MC113 Your eBay account has been suspended. It says ""recent account activity has raised serious security concerns"".

Thinking it was probably a scam email we opened the app up and indeed the account has been suspended. So i've just signed in on my computer and gone to the chat to see what the problem was. They've been absolutely no help at all, refusing to tell me why.

Here are a few copy &amp; pastes from the chat:

""Upon checking, the reason why your account is suspended is due to the discrepancies in your registered information.""

""Looking at your account, I can see that there are some serious policy breaches and discrepancies in your registered details, so I'm afraid we won't be reinstating your account. My sincere apologies""

""Due to the risk presented to the eBay community by your account, we have determined it is in eBay's best interest to deny your appeal. This means that we will not be reinstating your account. Your account has been suspended indefinitely. Our decision is based on evidence from our records. I'm afraid we don't share any further information about the specific evidence that led us to take action.""

""I'm really sorry. I completely understand that you just want to start here in eBay and if only I could do more to help you with this. However, my power to do so is just limited and I hope that you understand. But our decision is based on evidence from our records. We are not comfortable with your selling practices or your business model.""

And that was basically it, I asked for a phone number to speak to someone and they said they will tell me the same information as them.

So now, the account has been suspended, the listing removed and I really have no idea why, all I did was create an account for my dad, link paypal and add a credit card to paypal for the ebay fees etc. Any idea's why?",17,8,2015-03-28,EBAY,0.40267041325569153,0.5761956572532654,0.021133946254849434
Ebay,Do you ship to Indonesia?,"I have a ebay user asking me to ship a used bicycle wheel, ~$400 usd, to Indonesia.  I would have to ship USPS GXP because of the size restrictions and the price would be around $260 for shipping. The buyer is OK with the price.  

I've never had a problem with international buyers, but I've never shipped to Indonesia and have heard of widespread fraud and corruption.  The buyer has been a member since 2013 had has 27 positive feedback as a buyer. The sellers he is buying from sell similar items to what I have. 

I'm also worried about the very onerous sounding language on the USPS restrictions to Indonesia, such as:
Restricted: Used articles including clothing.

Addressees are required to obtain special authorization to receive gift shipments that contain any articles that are considered “luxury or semi-luxury” items (e.g., various kinds of haberdashery, technical goods, foodstuffs, office supplies, cameras and projectors) by the Indonesian authorities.

Many articles are subject to an import license or special authorization by the Indonesian authorities. Therefore, senders should ascertain from the addressee before mailing whether the necessary documents are held.

Ebay,Friday unhappy seller return woes...no help to be had from eBay...,"So, just reaching out for some opinions on this.

Last week, I sold a somewhat simple item, one of those Keurig carousels for coffee pods. Pretty straightforward, I offered free shipping, and the buyer (with somewhat low feedback, no negs or neutrals) paid promptly.

Fast forward to Wednesday of this week. I get a return request, reason chosen as ""item not as described"", with no outside messaging or contact, just the return request.

Then, I get another message, buyer claiming that they paid $27.40 in additional shipping fees at the post office (over and above the $8.95 I paid via my PayPal for USPS priority), for shipping on a 2 lb. package only 4 states away.

Wednesday, I contacted eBay, who've actually been pretty helpful, as of late, as long as you get a ""good"" rep.

The escalation team member I was forwarded to was great, understood my situation, and I agreed best to do, just accept the return, no need for any more contact, just close it, and issue a refund when item comes back in good order. (Great!)

I also have to say, after a lengthy explanation, and research on his part, same guy also removed two recent neutrals, that were pretty sketchy, and truly not really valid ones. (Thanks!)

Today, was an entirely different world.

No help, none. 2 hours on phone. 2 useless eBay employees.

No matter how many times I explained the weird situation, no budging on them just removing the negative.

""We cannot verify they paid the extra amount, so until they can prove it, we cannot remove the feedback at this time""

(also, the tracking shows clearly, it was ""delivered"""", no hold for addtl. postage at the P.O. , nothing.)

Also, when I mentioned my stellar service I'd received Wednesday, and that neutral feedback had been removed for me, the associate looked at that case, 

(bad idea on my part)

He proceeded to tell me, they'd pushed the removal through, using reasons that were inaccurate to the case(s), and, that it'd most likely result in disciplinary action for that employee.

Really, eBay, I've been here since 1997, 100% feedback to date, top rated seller, and you won't see your way to clear one very sketchy negative glaring on my front page, and then you proceed to make me feel guilty that I may have ruined someone's Friday by jeopardizing their job?

Sorry, about the rant, I'd just like some input so I don't feel like I've gone totally nuts on this.

Is there a way of eliminating this risk as a seller? If not, how would you minimize it?

Ebay,Ripped off by a BUYER. Anything I can do?,"We recently sent out two phones, iPhone 5 32GB and iPhone 6 64GB.  But when they were sent the addresses were swapped (our mistake).  So one person expected the i6 got an i5 (and sent it back and was issued a refund).  But the buyer who expected an i5 got an i6 and won't return it.

I looked her up and found where she works, her actual address and email address.  Ebay showed me how to request her personal phone number. 

I called her and she said she was at work and would call me later.  Never did, but she texted me after sending a few of my own texts and said she does not want me to contact her using any other form of communication besides eBay.  She sent one message on eBay saying she paid and that the transaction is over.  

I reported her to IC3.com and on eBay.  Is there anything else I can do?  This terrible person basically has stolen 450 dollars from my family (the difference in price of the two phones).  The bigger person just wants my phone back but the pissed off person inside of me wants revenge...  Will take both suggestions.  

Update:
Today she sent a message saying she'd send it back if I gave her $150 (extortion much?), paid for shipping and have her a full refund. What a bitch. I'm counter offering with my original fifty bucks and refund upon proof of shipping. I hate this person but it looks like blacklisting the phone worked!

Update 2:
She filed a return with eBay.  She claims to be taking the high road in this and ""doesn't even want the extra $100"" after I told her to buzz off with her $150 demand.  Instead she'll be gracious enough to do the right thing for $50 bucks.  So looks like we're getting somewhere but I don't see any proof she shipped it yet.  I can't wait to post the transcripts of her messages so you can see what I'm dealing with.  She sucks.  

Update 3: 
Got the phone back in our possession!  She claims to be taking the high road and teaching us to be civil in our interactions with people.  Ridiculous.  She expects us to give her $50 for her ""troubles"" but after the trouble she caused us I'm probably not giving it to her and will drag her along.  Am I being the better person?  No.  But I don't care.  I have the phone so she's nothing anymore.  

But, she took the SIM card out and didn't include it.  What value is this to her?  It was blacklisted...  Don't think it does her any good.

Ebay,New Seller: Buyer tried to return an item when I don't accept returns or refunds.,"Hey everyone! So I am fairly new to eBay, this is a long read, I'm thankful to anyone that takes the time to read it, I am just a bit paranoid.

I sold something on Feb 26 that was a ""preorder"". I made it very clear on my listing that I will ship it as soon as I got it which was estimated to get to me by late March, early April. I also said ""no returns or refunds"" unless something was wrong with the item. I happened to get it on March 24th and shipped it right away. I politely kept in contact with the buyer throughout all this. Suddenly, on March 25th, a case was opened against me while the item was in transit. I called eBay and they told me I did nothing wrong, the item arrived on March 26th and the case was closed in my favor. 

I checked the tracking number on friday and saw it was ""refused"" and is being sent back to me. I got a message saying the buyer is sending it back and they are requesting a full refund through a return request.

Ebay,Buyer cancellation requests on non refundable item,"Hello I'm a new seller on ebay.

I recently listed two high value items individually priced. One sold and the buyer is requesting a cancellation. The buyer has stated they did not know that they were buying one item for the listed price and did not realize it until after the sale was finalized. I communicated with the buyer that all sales are final and that they would of had to confirm that they were purchasing one unit as the quantity was a changeable option on their side. Upon creating the shipping label Ebay gave me and the buyer a message that the item could no longer be canceled. 

My fear is that they will no try to say the item was not as described and keep both the item and get a refund later. What would be the best move to make as to keep up with the expedited shipping I would need to ensure the package was dropped off at the post office first thing in the morning.",6,6,2015-03-30,EBAY,0.13262096047401428,0.8385434746742249,0.028835538774728775
Ebay,item shipped from China instead of the USA,"I bought a product that specifically said it's shipping from USA, I applied the filters to filter out only products available in the USA because I needed the product ASAP.  
after 3 days of wait they send me a tracking number using EMS coming from Shenzhen, I contacted the buyer and in lousy English he replies telling me that they made a mistake and shipped it from their China warehouse instead and that they wanna refund me 25% as an apology, I explain how I don't really need the 25% discount and I refuse it and explain I just need the product and he promises it will be delivered in a week.  
20 days later the item has just arrived in my local post office, of course I went ahead and bought the product from a local store once I knew the one I ordered from Ebay was coming from China.  
The problem now is that I will need to return it and then I have to pay for international shipping and I don't want to do that because I was mis-sold the item.

Ebay,Buy on eBay without using Paypal?,"I think a lot of people here mostly use their eBay account to sell. For me, I need eBay account solely for buying, and I thought it was easy. But recently, I have hit some very big obstacles just to buy on eBay, especially with Paypal. The other day, PP limited my account again and request 2 photo IDs and bank statement. I don't want to provide them those things. So PP is pretty much out of the picture.

The good thing is that my eBay account is still intact. I plan to buy using credit/debit card. But I heard that eBay doesn't allow buyers to use cards too much, and they require buyers to use PP.

So at this point I don't know what to do. I just want a solid way to buy items in large quantity on eBay. Some days I could buy stuffs worth thousand of dollars on eBay for my business, those range from perfume, shoes to high-end bags.

What should I do? Any suggestion? To be clear, I absolutely have no intention to sell on eBay. I just want to buy.",3,4,2015-03-30,EBAY,0.01911357417702675,0.9294989109039307,0.05138752982020378

Ebay,Buyer paid by credit card; I have concerns,"Buyer's account is two years old. They have no 'points'/completed transactions, either bought or sold. They messaged me shortly after item finished saying, 'i have paid'. I asked how they said 'credit card'. Poor communication is dubious.

My question is, Where will the funds appear? My PayPal or my bank account? They are yet to appear in either.

My concern is, once the item has been shipped the buyer will declare fraudulent transaction with their credit card provider and recoup the money, and I'm left standing like a mug.

Can anybody please assist or advise in this scenario? I have raised a ticket with eBay but they said it will take a few days to get back to me.",5,3,2015-03-30,EBAY,0.04892662540078163,0.9079901576042175,0.04308319836854935
