Ebay,The item I won was sold to someone else outside of eBay before the end of the auction.,"Hey r/Ebay, I've got a question for you. I won an auction which ended on Monday morning for $81. I paid for the item right away. Today, Tuesday, I got an email from paypal that the seller has issued a full refund:

""Message from merchant: As mentioned in the add.  Item was on sale locally and sold over the weekend at local Snowboard Park."" 

First of all, this isn't mentioned in the ad. 
There is a question and answer:

""Q:  	I'll give you 85 to end the auction now and ship to Irvine, CA. You can send me an invoice through paypal that way you won't have to pay ebay seller fees. Let me know as soon as you can thanks. 	
A:  	haha. you want to buy 1 shoe? these are $180, new at the store. mine have been worn for 1 day and are perfect. sorry $120 to end or just bid legally. The item is also on sale locally for $130 so first to get close to asking takes it. ""

This is appears to be a violation of Ebay policy as it is, but is there more? Does the seller have the right to sell the item on the side once its listed on Ebay? Is this considered ""inappropriate selling"" and should I report him? The ending price of the auction is lower than this guy thought he could get so how do I know he actually sold it and isn't just making it seem that way so he doesn't lose money?

Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks, all.",5,4,2011-02-01,EBAY,0.03412046283483505,0.9184887409210205,0.047390807420015335

Ebay,Why i will never use ebay again,"I put an item up on ebay which was pretty pricy (1500 for a laptop in perfect condition). Someone bid on it and after 4 days still has not paid. Their account is in Poland and in the one email they sent me it was asking for my paypal information (which is already listed in ebay..) in weird english. this buyer also has no previous history. none. nothing bought or sold before.

anyway. i'm no stranger to the internet. i don't want to be dealing with this person. so i call ebay and say i don't want to sell my item to said creep. i am told, that because my item is listed as sold, i have no right to take it off of the website until they either pay for the item, or 7 days goes by in which case i can appeal to have my item removed and my fees returned to me.  

i will never again use ebay. my laptop (which i am currently using and only selling to get a smaller one) is essentially held in escrow and i have no control over it. even if someone walked up to me right now and said they would buy it, i can't sell it to them because if the original, creepy buyer finally coughs up, i am OBLIGATED to sell it to them.   

I'm sure there are plenty of people who use ebay to buy and sell (i used to buy all the time) but as a seller, ALL the power is with the buyer. it's ridiculous. i realize the precautions are there to limit peoples liability, but there should be more control for people selling on ebay. 

in a situation like this, it should be pretty simple. call ebay, give examples why buyer is full of crap, listing removed. i feel like i'm being held hostage by my own property.   

will never use ebay again",12,0,2011-02-03,EBAY,0.046881526708602905,0.9263105392456055,0.02680794522166252
Ebay,Screw eBay,"Just sold some high value stuff on eBay early today. Get an e-mail in the afternoon that my user-account has been disabled/blocked/suspended.

This is the typical e-mail:

&gt;We're sorry to tell you that your eBay account was suspended because recent account activity has raised serious security concerns. We've taken this precaution to protect our members while we make sure that the activity doesn't cause harm -- however unintentionally -- to the eBay Community.
You can appeal this suspension. If, after reviewing your appeal, we're confident that this activity poses no risk to the Community, we'll be happy to reinstate your account. For information about how to appeal this suspension, please go to:

Now, I've had an eBay account for a fair amount of time. I had a ~190 feedback score. It isn't much compared to other people, but all I did was purchase things. Recently, I had decided to start selling things. When trying to create an account, I was asked to verify my identity because there was another account with the same address/information that may be linked/related to mine.

After two tries, I was able to verify my account and sell stuff. I can only assume that the other account(s) belonged to my father. Occasionally he sells stuff. Whatever. I moved out many months ago and do not live at that address; but it is still listed on my eBay account. Never bothered to remove it. 

Fast forward a bit. My folks have been struggling, and my father decided to sell some high value things he was keeping around till I got older. Idea was if I ever needed money or was struggling, I could sell the stuff and use the money. That is what he is doing now to survive essentially. 

So, with struggles like losing one's business, and possibility of losing a house I guess these high value items on eBay looked suspicious. My father had his account closed some time ago. 

Fast forward to today. After selling my item and getting payment for it; I authorize the transfer to my Paypal account, takes 3 days. This is when I see I got the above e-mail. I immediately contact customer service. After waiting for 25 minutes, I get a hold of some monotone woman. 

Apparently, merely because of the address on the account and some of the items I've sold; eBay's (automated?) system figures our accounts are linked and/or that we are the same person. Because of my father's accounts being closed they just figure that I am the same damn guy.

Now, the woman didn't disclose whose accounts or what the accounts were; or the criteria for what is considered ''linked''. She gave me some shit about ''protecting eBay's community from fraud''.

The shit? I've been an upstanding buyer in the community for a long time. I asked if there was any way I could repeal this action and get my account back. She said no. Even after I asked several times, and pleaded with her. I asked if I made a new account, if it would eventually link back to this old one. She said Yes. Uh, how so? 

A few hours later, I get an e-mail saying I have an open case. Guess the guy who brought said item saw my account was no longer active and figured I ran with his money. The Paypal transfer was canceled and his money ''on hold''. No, this isn't happening. 

I contact the seller through e-mail, feeling like I am going to have a heart attack. I almost canceled my class because of it. The guy apologizes and said he will close the case but that has yet to happen. Item ships out tomorrow. Dude lives in the same state, too. 

But, my account is still closed/suspended. They also seemed to take my $120 I had sitting in the account, too. Unless I miscalculated or they are going after my PayPal account too. But I don't see any error messages there other than the money being held. 

Screw eBay. I'd like for this to get attention but I haven't really decided if I care about the account or not. It's just so much easier to purchase crap used on eBay. But still. Always be weary of other people that have accounts, and the history of it. Will always get to you. Share this with other people who are sellers. Will check back for advice/comments.

I highly doubt with the way PayPal treated the likes of Wikileaks; that eBay would do anything if the Internet made enough of a stink. they are too big. 

Still, one can hope. Anyone have any suggestions for a eBay alternative?

Edit: Well, shipped the item. Got my monies. Seller will get item soon. He lives in the same state. Totally should've just delivered it to him to save more money. Oh well. 

Still doesn't resolve the fact I don't have an account anymore.

Will look into Amazon though; if anyone has any experiences with it, let me hear 'em below :)",6,5,2011-02-04,EBAY,0.13222630321979523,0.8438625335693359,0.023911118507385254

How hard is it to start selling your stuff on eBay? How risky is it? And how do you deal with shipping?

Ebay,How should I end this ebay feud?,"On January 16th, I won an auction for an FM transmitter for my car for $21. I promptly paid for it after seeing that I had won. This was after a month of waiting to receive another transmitter from Hong Kong. Assuming that it would be terrible quality, if I ever received it, I decided to order a higher quality transmitter.

5 days after ordering the transmitter, I noticed that it hadn't been shipped yet, so I questioned the seller about it. 5 days AFTER that (this is 10 days after the sale date), I received this response:

Hi there, I'm snowed in, and have been for several days. Unfortunately the snow plowers compacted my car in and wont be mobile for a few days. I'll let you know as soon as I'm able to get out and mail your item. Thank you for your patience

In the meantime, I received the transmitter from Hong Kong, and it actually worked great. Being slightly annoyed with other seller, though, I sent a somewhat cynical response asking for a refund:

Meh, besides that sounding like total bs, I already bought another FM transmitter in the meantime so I don't want this anymore. Give me a refund or I will give you negative feedback and report your account. I'll give you 3 days to do so. Sorry for being a dick.

Seller responds next day with:

Reallly, you dont want the item now? I mean thanks for letting me know , as I was finally able to dig out of the snow this evening and was planning on mailing it on my errands in the morning. Maybe you are in FL the only state in the US that doesn't have at least SOME snow on the ground at present, but I'm here in Sterling ,VA and we got 5-8 inches, closer to 8 at my house..so not total bs. I will give you a refund, fine , if you are sure you dont want it. I think this is cooler than just an FM transmitter because u can put all the songs from ur computter on there too and take it with you, but your choice. I havent had to give a refund before, I assume I just do it through paypal?

I had assumed that my last email, although cynical, was pretty clear that I did not want the item anymore and wanted a refund. So I responded with:

yarse

I expected to receive a $21 credit in my paypal within a few days. Didn't really let it bother, though, until ONE WEEK later (this is about 3 weeks after ordering) I received this response:

Hi the last response when asking if you want the item or not was ('YARSE"") and I don't know what that means. You can open an Ebay Buyer case against me, but its without warrant because you've said you don't want it or you do, but have not sent a clear message to me, and I can't send the item until I get a clear yes or no. Thank you.

At this point, I am thoroughly pissed off at this seller because I just want my refund already. I am also unable to open a dispute until the 9th, so I cannot force anything until then. So yesterday I sent another cynical response, since the seller obviously has no intention of giving me a prompt refund:

yarse=yes in my native language you racist asshole. So give me a refund already dickwad.

I also left negative feedback on their account:

Seller is a racist bigot!!!! Said he would not sell to me because I'm white!!!!!

This may not have been the best decision on my part, but I felt that the seller at least deserved negative feedback until ebay will let me resolve the issue. This is the response I got today:

Wow I have been cool and talked professionally to you until now, but you talking to me like that is unacceptable .especially when I am just trying to get a clear answer from you by asking what the hell YARSE means! you are saying YES then for me to send it, and then ask for a refund so either you are a little kid messing around on here, to explain your immaturity and unclearness..or you really are just a dick yourself. Eat your refund. you barely paid anything anyway so you reallly must be a..oh wait I'm not going to go TALKING like a racist. Hmm you really need to learn some online ettiquette. 

So....this email I think confirms that the seller does not want to give me a refund and will probably try something if I open a dispute.

Ebay,I fought eBay and I won!,"A few days ago I posted about my struggle with eBay and their Buyer Protection Plan.

Liquidating my iPod repair business, I listed a large number of iPods and parts in a single lot, with ""Broken/As-Is"" in the title.  Buyer whose username clearly indicates another iPod repair business purchases lot at buy-it-now price ($500).  AFTER making the purchase, he messages me and tells me that ""real broken iPods"" only have one issue, and that he expects to find mostly working parts.  I responded that I had not even touched over half of them; they were untested as described, and I could not vouch for their condition; that they were sold as-is, which is a gamble; and that I could only guarantee he would find them to be as described.

Upon receiving the box, he opened a Buyer Protection case, claiming that he was dissatisfied with the number of functional parts that he found, that the items were not as described, and that they were damaged.  I plead my case to eBay, and was soon informed that their ""Final Decision"" was in his favor on the grounds that ""The buyer claimed the item was damaged.""  They took $525 out of my paypal account and refunded it to him before I got so much as a tracking number for the return.

Infuriated, I filed an appeal to the ""Final Decision"" (?!) and in no uncertain terms informed eBay that their decision was illogical, unethical, and in violation of their own policies (namely, the ""Buyer Remorse"" clause), and that if they did not remedy the situation I would be ending my 9-year relationship with them.  The auto-reply said I'd get a response in 48-72 hours.  Six days passed with no news and I was ready to start bombarding them with angry phone calls.

Then, I got the email -- they had reversed their decision!  Not only that, but I got a hand-typed letter from a customer service rep informing me that protocol had not been followed in making their decision, and that after reviewing the details, I was clearly in the right.

So, screwed-over sellers, don't give up hope when your buyer tries to fuck you!  Fight it til the dirty end and know that somewhere, deep within eBay, there exist people with dignity and common sense.

Ebay,Thinking about selling something on ebay .... and dont want to get ripped off. What are some precautions I can take to prevent this?,"Thinking about selling a Desktop HD I recently got a deal on.... on ebay. I checked out what others have sold it for on ebay (searching the completed listings) &amp; figure I could sell it for at least $100 easily. Maybe even more. 

The thing is... I dont trust ebay not to take some scamming buyer's side over mine. All one of them has to do is claim that I never shipped it to him &amp; I am fucked. 

What are some precautions I can take to at least lower the odds of this happening? 

Note: I plan on trying to sell it on craigslist first for the least amount I am willing to part with. Ugh,I hate dealing with craigslisters though. The scammers, the people who jerk you around &amp; lowball-offerers suck.",5,1,2011-02-24,EBAY,0.04765772074460983,0.9169740676879883,0.0353681854903698
