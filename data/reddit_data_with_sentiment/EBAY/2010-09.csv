Ebay,A question about eBay rules,"I'm just wondering - when people have a very low buy it now option but the shipping is very excessive (clearly putting the moneys worth there), it's against eBay rules, right? 

[like this for example](http://i.imgur.com/srHgt.png)

Can anyone link me to where it says it's against the rules (if it is)

Ebay,Why do people bid up auctions days before they end?,"I don't know about everyone else, but, to me, it makes a lot more sense to save your bids until the last minute of an auction instead of bidding up the price, initiating a bidding war days before an auction ends.

What are your thoughts?",6,10,2010-09-17,EBAY,0.09061320871114731,0.8863958120346069,0.022990979254245758

Ebay,"Had a typographical transaction error, how do I resolve this?","Recently I listed my laptop on eBay. I love my laptop, and it's my only access to the internet, but I need the money very badly to pay my bills at the end of this month. Everything seemed to go smooth, I got about four or five bids, and the top bidder held up his end of the deal. 

The problem is, when I went to claim my payment with paypal, it asked to verify my email address. For some reason, this particular transaction was done not with my primary email, but with another unverified email address that I didn't submit to paypal. It *was* my email, but had a typographical error in it (myemailat@.com in stead of myemailat@hotmail.com). It said that I needed to verify that email address before I could receive payment for the auction. Well, I can't verify that email because it doesn't exist. I deleted that from my registered emails, and set it back to my primary email, but now I have no way to access the transaction.

So, the buyer paid, but I didn't receive the payment because of a typo. I'm not really sure what to do. I sent him an email asking whether he could cancel his end of the transaction, so that his money was returned to his account, so that we could start the transaction over (I explained the problem) but he hasn't replied.

Is there anything else I can do to rectify this? I don't have a lot of time, and I'm afraid that the buyer will accuse me of stealing his money and not shipping the laptop (I haven't shipped it yet), and then eBay will deduct the amount from my bank account and land me even further in debt. I also don't want to go ahead and ship the laptop before all of this can be fixed because I'll be equally screwed then.

Any ideas? I really need help. :'(",1,3,2010-09-22,EBAY,0.05223068222403526,0.9158580899238586,0.031911227852106094
