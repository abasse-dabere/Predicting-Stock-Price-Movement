This looks like a phishing attempt:

* ""Your email hasn't been read"". But, I haven't emailed eBay

* Title contains ""SR# [Action.SR Number]"" instead of an actual reference number

* Body contains ""[Action.Account Name]"" instead of my account name

* Email specifies ""Pacific Time"", but I'm in the UK

I examined the email headers: they look real; the link really is a link to eBay

I checked my eBay messages. The message is there too. The link directs me to talk to eBay's Trust &amp; Safety, on 866-540-XXXX (but I'm in the UK)

I contacted customer support, using the UK phone number. **They confirm the message is from eBay**, but can't tell me why I received it.

Ebay,Question about late feedback and return requests,"A buyer purchased a humidifier from me 3/12/2013, then messaged me yesterday saying that it just stopped working and he would like a refund. I told him he was welcome to ship it back for a refund. I always offer a 14 day return window, which has long past. I also noticed that he hasn't left feedback on his purchase yet. Return shipping is always the responsibility of the buyer.

So I'm curious... when he realizes that shipping will cost $40 to ship it back, he will surely be upset about it. If he decides to leave negative feedback, is there protection against that?

What is the latest I should entertain refunds? 

How late in the transaction can a buyer leave feedback? 

What happened to the buyers that never leave feedback? Can they just pop up one day (say, a year later) and say that their coffee maker stopped working.

Ebay,Question about Ebay purchase/sales,"Hi! I have been trying to sell my treadmill on ebay three times now. The first two times, the buyer was confused and didn't realize that it was listed for ""local pick-up only."" After the first time, I thought surely a second person wouldn't make the mistake, so I also added ""local pick-up only"" in the description. Sure enough, a second person didn't notice that it was local pick-up only. So this third time, I put in the description with a huge red font, all caps, ""local pick-up only!!"" Well someone has bought it. Except their address is out of state again! I surely hope they read my description. I have sent them a message asking when they plan to pick up the treadmill and they have yet to get back to me, and they haven't paid yet, which is fine since I don't mind them paying when they pick it up. I just need to ask what I should do if they didn't see the description? I understand people make mistakes but shouldn't there be a penalty for this? What if he pays for it and doesn't pick it up because he thought I will ship it? Cancel it AGAIN and try to relist and hope the next person realizes I am not shipping this treadmill, which would cost more to ship than the damn thing costs! lol

Ebay,Multiple categories (Australia),"[Before May 1st](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/sell/fees-previous.html)

[After May 1st](http://pages.ebay.com.au/help/sell/fees.html)

So before the changes I listed in two categories to reach more people. Namely a very specific category, and in Collectables. I list two auctions per night, and it cost me $1.00 to list in two categories. 

After this change, I can list in collectibles for free, but it will cost $1.50 to list in the specific category. If I continue like I have, my costs from just auction listings will increase by 33%. 

My question is: am I actually reaching more people by listing in two categories, or can I list in one category (collectibles) and save myself a significant amount of my monthly eBay fees? I have alternated my auctions' categories for the next week or so to see if my final auction price will be affected by listing in only one category, but I'd like some other input too. 

The free fixed price listings are nice, but doesn't save me much ($3-4 worth of listings at 20c each per month). 

This increase is pretty outrageous in my opinion, from 50c for starting prices of 0.99-$20 and $1.50 for $20-99.99, to a flat $1.50 for anything under $100 starting price. I don't understand it, they still get FVF + PayPal fees for stuff that ends at over $20, why do they feel the need to raise the price for dollar auctions?!

I can't wait for an alternative to eBay. Quicksales has very reasonable fees, but no customers at all. I listed there a few months ago and haven't made a single sale.

Ebay,Why can't we leave negative feedback anymore?,"So I started using ebay again recently. For the most part it has been going quite well, and after 130ish transactions, I've had no reason to leave negative feedback, but then this one person, with 100% positive feedback and like 1500 feedback total, decides she doesn't want to pay for her item, and even goes as far as pulling the ol' ""The check is in the mail"" line even though I clearly only accept paypal and do not give out my address.

So I filed a non-paying buyer thing, wait a month and get my final value fees back. Most people would probably be satisfied by this, but I'm not. This person was not only a non-paying bidder, but  a liar too, and I wanted to leave negative feedback.

I replied back and just basically said that I was very sorry she was unsatisfied and if she had contacted me to let me know she needed it a bit quicker I would have been more than happy to provide her with faster shipping and offered to give her a half refund or something.


TBH at this point she still hasn't responded and I think I should have just given her the refund, but now I'm just kind of curious, does this really count as an Item Not Received situation if the item is clearly still in transit to her as evidenced by the tracking information?

I followed ebay's documentation, but after wading through the ""advanced selling tools"" vs the basic web UI while experiencing severe latency on the site due to user traffic I have decided 1.) I must be a retard 2.) Ebay has two teams on two continents operating in two different centuries and speaking different languages based on how the options on the advanced tools don't appear to be an evolution of the choices offered by the UI on the basic tools. I hope that makes sense.

After spending what may be 50 hour weeks since February to consistently prepare and sell items worth about a quarter each and eating the loss on shipping every single time I'm about to jump off a bridge with a rope around my neck and all my cats in my backpack and a categorical renouncement of life in general.

&lt;/rant&gt;

It looks like I'm going to have to create a bunch of mock auctions uploading a few image sizes to see what gets the results I want. This post is basically a rant as I'm getting evicted and once again at the end of a project I find that actually?

I didn't get anything done.

EDIT: It gets better. I'm looking at the color tone in the screenshots? And it looks like the same image. The same image was uploaded twice. The behavior on from the site display and not based on the image. This makes no sense. I would go intensely look for work now to stave off the sheriff's notice/eviction but I MUST FINISH AT LEAST THE FIRST ROUND OF THESE GODDAMN AUCTIONS BEFORE I DO. The screenshots with the varying zoom sizes based on mouseover behaviors? Appears to be based on if you used the basic auction tool or the advanced auction tool. So I fucking detest ebay.

I feel like Master Shake. I just want to run to the nearest living thing and kill it. Doing this for six months has reduced me to this. It can't be me, surely these easy to use tools are retarded.

Ebay,Any sellers ever randomly get limited on quantity you can sell in certain categories?,"I currently have 501 feedback (95%+ of those are from selling), no negs in last year. Been selling on and off for 12 years. Power seller, top rated seller. Only one case opened in recent history and it was for a refund request which was fulfilled and closed without issue, and it was not in the categories in question. DSR ratings are 5,5,5,4.9 so pretty darn good IMO.

Out of the blue I go to list a piece of computer software and get a series of odd errors, which culminated in suddenly mid-listing having a notice pop-up that I am now category restricted. No explanation why. I have about 125 auctions going and 9 of them are software. At this same time my listings started costing me money even though I had an eBay store and had lots of free listings left to use. They eventually went back to being free after a day or so.

After an hour on hold with customer support, and being transferred to a person higher up who seemed to know her stuff, and I was basically told that I had a 'new seller' restriction on my account for some reason unknown to the tech support, and there was nothing she could do. She listed about half a dozen categories I wouldn't be able to post in for the next month. These included computer software, books, music, clothes, and other media formats. She said these are in place to protect buyers.  All told I had about 15 auctions going that fit in those categories.

It just irritates me that I just upgraded to an eBay store last month so I could list many items that are now restricted to me. Also apparently I'm the kind of seller we need to protect buyers from?

Has anyone else had this happen to them?",11,2,2013-05-06,EBAY,0.046445488929748535,0.9258232116699219,0.027731267735362053
Ebay,"I sold a phone today, how do I protect myself so I don't lose money","I sold an unpopular phone on ebay and the person who bought it had only 1 feedback which was left today after he bought another phone from a different guy. Both the phones he bid on today were boost mobile phones so it's weird to me to buy two phones in one day.

This is my third phone I sold on ebay, the first two were fine but I think the people who bought them had more feedback. (can't remember, they were sold months/year ago).

It was sold to someone in the United States.  I already know to slap on a delivery Confirmation (signature) and tracking.  Is there any other thing I can do to protect myself?  I have a return policy already on there so if something is wrong they can ship it back...

I wonder if I should record myself placing it in a box so if they break it I have proof I wasn't the one who did that..

The buyer has since messaged me saying it does not work. I can not verify what vehicle he tried to install it in, or if he installed it correctly. But he is asking me what i am going to do for him, and he will leave feedback pending my reply.

Ebay,Question about Resolution Center and escalating a case.,"A buyer opened an Item Not Received case against me last week. I was slow in getting the item packed up and sent off, but I had finally sent their package the day before they opened the case. I sent it vis USPS in a Priority Mail Tyvek envelope, and at the time, I did not realize that those envelopes came with automatic tracking. Because of this, I told the buyer in the Resolution Center that I did not have a tracking number. 

When I mailed another Tyvek Priority envelope yesterday, the cashier told me that they came with free tracking, so I went looking for the receipt from the day I mailed the Item Not Received package, and found the tracking number. According to the USPS website, the package was delivered on May 2. I went and added the number to the case in the Resolution Center, and sent the buyer one more note along the lines of ""Yay look I found out I did have a tracking number, and USPS says the package has been delivered, so if you could close this case, I would really appreciate it!"" (Paypal placed a hold on my account for the funds, which of course I understand.)

I've been sending the buyer similar communications (when I started getting feedback for buyers whose packages I mailed out at the same time as the Item Not Received package, I checked in with the buyer to see if they had arrived yet), but they haven't responded at all. 

Here's my question (finally!): If I escalate the case, and can prove that the item was sent out and delivered (with this tracking number), is eBay likely to be on my side? I know they generally side with the buyers, which is totally understandable, but I can prove that I mailed the package, and I'd like to get the money that I am owed.

Ebay,eBay not enforcing VeRO,"Hopefully you guys can provide a little insight to this issue.
 
I have a friend of mine that produced an item. It was a hand sculpted model based off of a 'small' part used in a sci-fi movie. He made resin copies of the item and sold them on eBay 2 years ago. During that time, an unscrupulous individual purchased the item under one eBay account. A few weeks later (under a different eBay account) he began selling counterfeit copies of the item. (That is he put the item in silicone and created his own resin copies). The new seller also undercut my friend's price by a few bucks and as a result my friend could no longer find buyers to purchase his item.

Jump to 7-8 weeks ago when my friend was telling me about this. I explained that VeRO program could help him as his property rights were clearly violated. He submitted a Notice of Claimed Infringement (NOCI) and added me on as a party that could also enforce his rights. That was 6-7 weeks ago. eBay sent canned response after canned response until finally he gave up. I joined in and emailed eBay on his behalf and continued to receive canned response after canned response.

This is the most recent email, and is similar to the rest:

""The eBay Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) program is designed to process reports of intellectual property infringement. However, from the information you provided, it doesn't look like you're reporting an incidence of infringement.  Although future emails from you will be read, unless they contain additional information for review, we will be unable to respond.""

I have asked numerous times now for eBay to explain why this does not fall under copyright infringement, and they have refused to answer through several successive emails. Here is what VeRO says about copyright infringement:

""3.2. Item(s) infringes copyrights (for example, a bootleg recording of a live performance, a pirated copy of media such as software or movies, or an unlawful copy of copyrighted works such as text, paintings, or sculptures).""

They refuse to accept that my friend has any kind of claim to his item. Partly because it is based off of something from a movie, and (in my opinion) partly because eBay makes a lot of money off of the counterfeiting seller. The counterfeit seller has numerous other items (counterfeit items too) available and has tens of thousands of dollars worth of items listed right now. Most of the seller's items are ripped off from other people, and I know I'm not the only one working to get eBay to enforce a VeRO claim against him right now.

To make matters worse, the seller has expanded his 2 accounts to 3 accounts and is now double dipping by selling the items on both accounts simultaneously. So even if we get eBay to enforce my friend's rights after 7 weeks of trying... we'll have to start all over with VeRO to get them to do the same on the other account.

Is there any reason why this wouldn't be a valid VeRO case? I had basically provided eBay with all the information they needed, and if they looked at the seller, it should have been very obvious. They didn't seem to be disputing the fact that the seller purchased the item and counterfeited it, but rather wanted to dispute (in their opinion) that my friend held no rights to the item he hand sculpted. If that is indeed true, they are holding the counterfeit seller to a lesser standard than my friend.

What do you guys think?

TL;DR: Friend of mine sold an item on eBay. The guy that bought it counterfeit it and began selling it on eBay. eBay refuses to do anything about it.",5,1,2013-05-09,EBAY,0.06884732097387314,0.9039193987846375,0.027233272790908813

Ebay,What do I do about neutral feedback?,"Hello, I'm a brand new ebay user.  I've bought a couple of things and sold a handful of items.  I'm still getting the hang of things like how to properly list items and ship them.  Well, I just got a neutral feedback on a purse that I sold.  I said it was ""new without tags"" because it was clearly an unused purse.  In the feedback, the buyer said she was unhappy with the smell of the bag and that she already gave it away to Goodwill. 

Am I supposed to do something about this?  I'm sad that the buyer is unhappy but she didn't ask for anything so I'm not sure what to do.  Also, I don't believe that someone would buy a bag online and be so unhappy that they would give it away to Goodwill the same day.  Wouldn't she first try to return it and get her money back?  I don't offer returns but I understand that ebay offers buyer protection and thus can make me accept returns if my listing is not accurate.  Is the neutral feedback a hint that I should offer a discount or something?  I don't even know how to do that.

Should I just ignore the neutral feedback and try to do better?  Or is there a normal procedure to try to make the buyer happier?

Ebay,eBP Return Policy Coverage,"Email I got this morning:

*With our Policy update on April 9th we wanted to call out that eBay Buyer Protection (eBP) does now cover sellers return policies. This is a great thing for buyers and helps build trust in the eBay brand and how eBP can impact that brand.*

*Sellers Return Policy*

*As long as the buyer contacts the seller within the sellers return policy time frames they are able to be covered by eBay Buyer Protection if the seller does not honor their return policy even if the buyer is having “buyer’s remorse”. This means that if the seller has a 14 day return policy; and the buyer contacts them on day 13 after receiving the item requesting to return it for a full refund the seller needs to honor their return policy. If they do not honor their return policy eBP is able to step in can request the return of the item for a full refund.*

*Where Can I Find This Information?*

*You can find this information on the [Buyer Protection Help Pages](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/buyer-protection.html) under “Other Returns”.*

Ebay,eBay/Paypal redirecting me on payment,"Hey!

I went to pay for an auction that I've won, eBay took me through the usual and took me to Paypal to login and confirm payment.

Once I pressed the ""Confirm Payment"" button, I was simply redirected back to eBay's ""Pay Now"" page.

I've attempted it 3 times in two different browsers and having the exact same result.

I've received no e-mail receipt, nothing on my statement, nothing taken out of my bank. (there is enough in there to actually pay)

I've stopped now due to worries of being charged more than once - but has anybody experienced this before?

What do I do?

Ebay,Possible scammer? Could use some advice.,"I have recently been trying to sell a Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX HD for the past three weeks.  The first time, someone bid but didn't pay and I had to open a non paying bidder case.  This time, someone purchased it via Buy It Now and has paid already.

Unfortunately, they had requested I mail the item to the United Kingdom instead of the address on file with PayPal.

In speaking with eBay support, as long as I mail to the address on file with PayPal, they can't get the money back.  If I mail it anywhere else, they can open an unsent item case.  Also, the choice to either refund the money or send the item is up to me, but if I do send it, it MUST be to the address on file.

Ebay,Crazy Ebay Lady,"She advertised, ""BNIB! DeWALT 1/2"" DRILL/ HAMMER 18V FULL KIT BIMC! W/ 2 DIFFERENT SETS OF BITS""  She said it was not compact.  I bought it thinking great deal.  Then noticed, it might not be a hammer drill so I asked.  She said, not a hammer drill, but never said it was a compact drill.  It arrives-compact drill.  We go back and forth, I ask for an apology, she threatens to call the police.  Lastest from her-in all caps, and my response.

Why so hostile?  There is a little button on the keyboard that says caps lock, maybe yours is stuck.
YOUR JUST TRYING ANYTHING TO MAKE LIFE DIFFICULT No just asking for an apology, or, if you won't do that, the price diference
FIRST YOU WANT THIS Aplogy yes,
THEN YOU WANT THAT Price difference only if no apology
THEN YOU WANT SOMETHING ELSE No. Only apology or price difference that is it.
YOU MADE IT CLEAR YOU WANTED THE DRILL EVEN THOUGH I OFFERED 3 TIMES TO CANCEL YOUR BID!!!!!!No only one such offer.  And at that time you lead me to believe it was not a compact drill.
WELL YOU NOW HAVE USED THE DRILL.  I have never said I used the drill.  Where do you get this information from?  Do you just make things up-well we know that is true because you keep saying this is not a compact drill when Dewalt says it is.
AND THE BIDS AND IT IS NOT CONSIDERED NEW ANYMORE AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO EXTORT MONEY FROM ME OR ANYONE ELSE.  Extort?  That is pretty serious accusation.  It is not extortion to ask for an apology or the price difference on goods that do not match the description.  
YOU MADE IT CLEAR BUDDY My name is not Buddy.  
THAT IT WAS YOUR LACK OF RESEARCH AS YOU PUT IT.....I MADE IT CLEAR I WOULD CANCEL YOUR BID IF YOU WANTED.  And you did not tell me it was compact, under Dewalt standards, in fact telling it was not compact.
I HATE THIEVES. Self loathing is an awful thing.
AND I WILL NOT TOLERATE ANYONE WHO TRIES TO EXTORT GOODS OR MONEY FROM ME.  Good thing it is not happening then.
HOW DARE YOU!  How dare you!
FIRST YOU SAY ITS FALSE ADVERTISING Yes
THEN YOU SAY ITS THIS What is this?
THEN YOUSAY ITS THAT  What is that?
THEN YOU WANT A REPLACEMENT  Never asked for that.

Ebay,"I have obviously been scammed, anyone with experience in my special case? details inside.","first of all, please excuse any wrong words, false grammar and/or funny descriptions as english is not my native tongue :)


so, i have recently sold some items on ebay.
one of them was a really rare collecters item (at least here in germany).
the item sold for approx. $80. as i wanted to make a good impression on the buyer, i included some extra postcards from the same tv series.
i shipped it without insurance (stupid) and without tracking (even more stupid).  payment was made via paypal.

after about a week, i got a message from the buyer (lets call him A) , along these lines: ""package not here!! infos??????""

i answered i would try to take care of that. so i contacted the carrier, my local post office and so on. they could not help me, as there was no tracking number.

well, several days and messages later, the buyer  opened a case via ebay. the customer service took care of the case, gave me a warning, but also gave me back my money. 
i had my experience, but at least i got my money. 
up until here nothing special.


**tl;dr no.1: sold item. buyer claims it never arrived.**


this is where it got interesting :)

i got one of these alarms in the ebay-app on my smartphone, where it notifies you whenever a certain article is offered by someone.

it notified me that an ebay-user (lets call him B) auctions the exact same postcards that i added to my ""lost"" package... strange coincidence i thought.

 the facts that user A and B live in the same small town got me thinking.
i read some of the recent reviews of user B. on said ""pleasure as always! thanks *firstname*!""
the same first name as user A, and they live in the same town......

whats next? off to facebook.com :D

i search for the complete name of A, and actually find it. (rare) name, same town. interests EXACTLY what both ebay-profiles A and B  suggested ( one musician and one tv-series).

the profile is completely public, so i go through his photo albums. there is one called ""my XY collection"" and one picture, dated 6 days after i dispatched his item, shows this. exact. item...

i am f§$%ing angry as f§$&amp;k :) i put a lot of effort in solving the case, had days of continued stress when dealing with the carrier and ebay. and this... guy....

there is no way, that i could proof that this is not a coincidence, but i willl be damned if that is the case....

i already contacted ebay with links and screenshots to each and everything that could help, but they already told me, IF they can do anything, they wont tell me what exactly. i respect the privacy of others, and if his account is deleted, i will get to know that one way or the other.

But is there anything else i can do?

i googled that exact problem, but most of the times its the other way around. sellers that dont ship the goods.

thanks to his facebook i know so much about this guy, it really creeps me out. still i dont want this to become personal. but i also dont want him to go on the way he does.

Ebay,Seller sold me an item that was damaged and is now blaming me,"Warning: This may turn long, but I'll try to keep it as brief as possible while retaining all the pertinent facts.

I was in the market for an Oculus Rift for a project I've been working on, so I hopped on eBay and found one that came with the TF2 hat code, which I thought would be a nice thing to have. It was originally an auction, but I asked if they had a BIN price in mind. They did, I agreed with it, they added the BIN to the auction and I used it. The item was listed as being in ""new, unused"" condition, and there were no caveats to this in the listing description.

The item went out last Monday and arrived on Thursday, and I signed for it and set it aside for 24 hours at which point I opened it up and started setting it up. Once I got it up and running, I discovered that there were two bright spots on the LCD screen inside the Rift which looked really weird. I started poking around online to try and figure out what they were, and I shot off a message to the seller and one to the Oculus VR support team (makers of the Rift). The seller's message was letting them know that there might be an issue, that I was contacting the manufacturer to see what it was and possibly get a repair, and that I would be in touch with them when I had more info. I got a couple of basic suggestions from Oculus (spray out dust, make sure it's not the computer/cable/etc) and the weekend rolled around before we could continue.

Through some more research and careful examination of the damage (which turned out to be physical both to the LCD and the LCD plastic coating/covering), I started to realize that the damage was LCD burn. Because the rift has two magnifying lenses over the LCD, sunlight or bright overhead lighting can be focused onto the LCD screen, resulting in irreparable damage. I was at a loss for how this could have happened until I happened to glance at the listing again and realized that the seller had taken pictures of the Rift and accessories outside in bright sunlight. 

I immediately contacted the seller and then Oculus again, letting everyone know what I had discovered. I informed the seller that I still was hopeful that Oculus would repair the damage (despite them not being obligated to do so), and if not, I would have to return the item since it was damaged before it arrived.

I then received a long message from the seller accusing me of having buyer's remorse, violating a ""warranty"" by performing the ""unauthorized"" action of contacting Oculus and a whole host of other things. Their end statement was, essentially, that they had no intention of giving me a refund and to take it up with eBay. I did just that and opened a dispute claiming that the item was not as described when it arrived. In the message I had to send to the seller, I summarized my original message and points. 

Since then (it's been under 24 hours since I opened the case), the seller has escalated their claims to saying that I'm trying to scam them, that I admitted to damaging the unit myself (reviewing my messages, I can definitively say that I did not say anything of the sort, and I have been denying those claims in follow-up messages) and again that I did something wrong (indeed, so wrong that it means she cannot refund me even if she wanted to) by trying to contact the manufacturer about the issue, an action I took to try and minimize this type of situation in the first place.

Here's the interesting thing. As an 8-year, 100% positive feedback score (with around 45 transactions), I expected a 10-year, 100% positive with 100+ transactions to act rationally and politely, which is why I was being nice and keeping them informed with what I was finding out about the damage during my research.

What's my likelihood of winning this case? She claims that because she had another person look at the Rift with her and they both didn't see any issues (which I completely understand, since they likely did that *before* taking the photos of the Rift where the lenses were in direct sunlight) there couldn't be any damage and I'm a scammer. I have a photo of the damage [here](http://i.imgur.com/LGbhIFl.jpg) which isn't super great, but is time stamped on my phone. 

My current actions are simply to reiterate my points (I received damaged goods when I was promised goods in new unused condition) whenever she responds, since my trying to explain what could have happened are falling on deaf ears. It'll be 3 business days before I can escalate the case, but is there anything else I can do in the meantime? I haven't used eBay in a while, but when I last did, it was a good experience. This pretty much sours me to the whole thing.

Ebay,"I'm being harassed by a seller(s), are they allowed to pull this kind of crap?","So, I bought something from a guy because when I asked him questions through ebay messaging, he gave me wrong information. When I received the item, it was clearly not up to his description. So I file a claim and after much dispute he agrees to total refund (cost, and shipping costs both ways). Now it was a total headache to make him agree to this.

Usually sellers who are in the wrong provide a shipping label for you to you return, but this guy insisted I pay up front. So I did anyways, and returned it to him. So now after a couple of weeks, I'm doing my feedbacks and I give him a NEUTRAL because it was like a scenario from Dell CS. 

Then all of a sudden, he retracts payment for the return shipping claiming ""Item not received."" Keep in mind that I have all kinds of tracking on this and plenty of evidence, which is now already sent to PayPal and eBay.

Now my question is... are seller allowed to pull this kind of crap on buyers? That they provide a refund, only if you don't leave ANY feedback? I feel like its some kind of extortion; they should be giving me a refund because they made a mistake.

Now this guy has given me a positive feedback with this message:

&gt;""OP"" is a SCAMMMMMM... All Ebayers ""BEWARE!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!


**Additionally**...

There's another seller who shipped something relatively small and cheap (less than $5) from within the contiguous US that had no tracking. After 2 weeks of not getting the item, I asked him/her where it was, and he/she replied to just wait. So I wait until the final shipping date which was provided by eBay, now about a month, and still I receive no item so I open a case. I opt for still wanting the item, but the guy gives me a refund w/o any communication with me. So I'm pretty displeased now, as I've been waiting a MONTH for something that I can get faster from China.

So after a while, I also leave some neutral feedback on this guy and I receive this message today:

&gt; 3) we give you 100% refund on one condition: you will never leave any feedback.

&gt;4) now we need leave feedback for you, please choose one:
= ""OP"" is a SCAMMMMMM... All Ebayers ""BEWARE!!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!

My money was refunded (and paypal sent me a confirmation of this). So my question is what kind of feedback do I give?  Sending stuff to the wrong address seems a little suspicious and it the seller did not communicate anything to me in the interim, so I'm leaning towards negative feedback.

Ebay,One particular thing I would like eBay to change.,"So the other day I posted about wanting to sell serious on eBay (mainly phone cases) and I was told it was not that profitable because you can't compete with Chinese sellers etc.

I live in the UK, I when I search for iPhone cases, a lot of Chinese sellers come up and maybe a few UK sellers. 

I was thinking eBay could add a feature, that shows the buyer if he is buying locally and not a country which is halfway around the world. 

Maybe add a badge at the front of the listing before the buyer clicks on it. 

Now I know you can see where the seller comes from in the listing etc but it could be made more clearer before opening the listing. 

eBay gives a badge to people who are top rated sellers. They could do the same if your a local seller.

This would keep the the buyers money within their own country and it helps the economy grow in their own country instead of giving it to Asian countries. 

This could be the same in every country

A US buyer would see a badge on a US listing. A UK buyer would see a badge on a UK listing etc

I know some people would rather save money and buy the cheapest product they can no matter were it comes from but I know of others that would use this feature. I would, even if it did cost a little bit more to buy locally.

Ebay,"UPDATE: ""Not As Described"" Chargeback Done Via CC Company Outside Of PayPal","Some of you may have read a post I made about a person doing a Visa Code 53 (Not As Described Merchandise) against one of my sales a few months ago. This person made an incredibly weak attempt to return a ""defective"" item by suggesting that I send a replacement to her in Russia before she sent the original back. Based on my refusal, she was able to succesfully get her CC to give her a code 53 chargeback outside of PayPal. My funds were stripped instantly, and she thought it was over with. She threatened harassment charges (she is back in the U.S. now) if I attempted to contact her any further regarding the matter. 

For those of you who don't know, this type of chargeback is not covered under Paypal/eBay seller protection. There was never a case opened, just the reversal. PayPal will go to bat for you with the CC company, but there is no guarantee (several reps told me I had little hope) of getting your money back, and the buyer is ""supposed to"" return your merchandise, but the general perception is that this is not heavily enforced. 

There is little information on these types of situations around the internet, and the information that I found almost always ended with the seller losing the money and the item. 

Well, I actually won the case, the entire $800 is back in my PayPal account as of this morning. A knowledgable PayPal rep told me that the only time he ever sees a victory in this scenario is when the seller documents anything and everything. I submitted all of our emails, tracking, the signature upon delivery, her positive feedback left, even some iOS text message screenshots. I literally had a page full of stuff for them to send to the CC and it really paid off. 

The point of this post is this... if this ever happens to you - YOU CAN WIN! Don't just lay down and give up, get any info you can from the buyer and forward it on to the CC company, there is hope for sellers in these situations, especially if you can provide lots of info.",8,20,2013-05-22,EBAY,0.09021914750337601,0.8804517388343811,0.029329070821404457

The eBay page says that second chance offer can be used to sell duplicate items so I'm assuming that if you try to use it, the winner can still pay and will obviously be expecting the item. So second chance offer doesn't really work for trying to cancel a win without getting bad feedback.

Is that correct?",1,0,2013-05-23,EBAY,0.05458308383822441,0.8936910629272461,0.051725901663303375

Ebay,"Ugh, buyer is trying to scam me. Now have to deal with Paypal. Thoughts?","So, I sold a Blackberry 9930 on Ebay a week or so ago. The buyer paid about a day later, with an address that had a # sign followed by a series of digits. I shipped it out as requested using USPS Priority Mail on a Saturday. On Monday it was delivered at 2:11pm, and at 2:45pm the buyer instituted a ""Significantly Not as Described"" PP dispute. His description was in Spanish, which translated meant that the phone was not working when he received it. Naturally I replied with a question about how it was not working, to which he immediately escalated to a claim. I responded by agreeing to refund the money if the buyer sent me the item back. 

The next day, the buyer added a tracking number to the claim. I immediately checked it. Strangely, the number showed that the package originated in Hayward, CA, and I had shipped the item to Doral, FL (more on this later). I checked the buyer's purchase history, and lo and behold, he had purchased a watch for $6.99 the day before and guess where it was coming from - Hayward, CA. 

Today, I received the ""return."" As expected, the package with the uploaded tracking number had the $6.99 watch, and had the buyer's name and account # as the name with my address. After doing a little more digging, I discovered that the address in Doral, FL is for a mail forwarder commonly used in South/Latin America. So there's no way my buyer actually got the item when it was delivered to Doral, but he was simply waiting to see it hit and then instituted the dispute. 

I have saved PDFs of his purchases for the $6.99 watch and taken numerous pictures of the package received today as well as its contents. Is there anything else I can do? The buyer does not respond to any emails. I have another 7 days before I can report that I have not received the item, at which time I am sure Paypal will look at his tracking number and probably question why it says delivered. 

I guess I have been lucky as this is the first time someone has tried to scam me on Ebay (I also don't sell a lot). Any thoughts on whether I can do anything else? Should I just wait out the next 7 days, or should I be proactive and contact Paypal about what I received and the other scam-related issues?",22,6,2013-05-24,EBAY,0.03998388350009918,0.9277068972587585,0.0323091559112072

Ebay,Is it really that easy for someone to scam an honest seller? Huge eBay/Paypal Loophole.,"TIL You can just go on eBay, buy an item (like the iPhone 4 I sold), pay by Paypal using a credit card, then claim the item was ""not as described"", and get your money back and still keep the phone. Seriously, try it. eBay and/or Paypal does nothing. I sent a perfectly working iPhone 4 to this kid in New York, and all he has to do is say, ""No, not as described"" and viola eBay will judge based off his word. I sent them proof of shipment, proof of delivery, I have pictures of the phone working perfectly right before I shipped it, and still nothing. He didn't even tell me what the problem was, he just said, ""Due to the severe nature of the problem."" How ambiguous is that? I even asked him to send the phone back if there is a problem and I'll refund him but it doesn't matter because he was refunded anyway, and still has the phone. This is the most insane eBay/Paypal loophole in the world. What more can I possibly do?

Ebay,[Seller] Question on displaying shipping on a listing?,"I recently posted this carryon bag to eBay. The size of it is rather large and I've been burned on shipping before so I listed correct weight and dimensions of the package I intended to sell it in. Then after I listed it I saw the shipping range of $6-48 and was shocked. So after a few days of no bids I decided to add a flat rate box option to the listing as well. 

Now with that added in the shipping should be $6- 12.30 but when I tested it out with further area codes it lists the shipping at the weighted price still instead of the flat rate price scaring off potential buyers before they even see a flat rate option.

Is there any way I can do it so the cheaper option is always shown at the top of the listing?

Unfortunately, we had to cancel bids and purchases for the following buyer because they're no longer registered on eBay:



In these types of situations, we'll credit the final value fee for removed listings won by this buyer, and also the insertion fee if it was a single-quantity listing.

We also recommend you take the following actions:

-- If you haven't received payment, don't complete the sale or send the item to the buyer.

-- Don't communicate with the buyer directly.

-- Verify any payments you've been notified of by logging in to your PayPal account (or other online payment service).

-- If the buyer requests refunds or additional payments, don't send any money without contacting eBay first.

-- If you've already sent the item, try contacting the shipping carrier to find out if you can stop shipment.",15,3,2013-05-30,EBAY,0.07691703736782074,0.9009513854980469,0.02213159203529358

Ebay,How do I close a Resolution Center case?,"I sold an item on May 21st. On May 22nd I opened a ""You want to cancel this transaction"" case. Since then, the buyer has not paid, never contacted me, nothing. its like he bid and then deleted his account.

It has been almost 8 days (to the second) since I opened the case. The information says I can close the case after 7 days and the buyer has not contacted me. However, there is absolutely NO option to close the case anywhere. Its like eBays instructions on how to close a case were written by someone who never actually used the Resolution Center. So how can I close my case and feel free to relist my item?

Ebay,Question about resolving getting an item not as advertised,"This is mundane, I apologize. 

So, I purchased a tablet that was titled has having a Core i5 in it but the specs within the description showed that it was an i7 model. Curious about this I asked the seller who confirmed through ebay that it should be the i7 as ""this is what the specs show."" I buy it and it turns out to be the i5. I e-mailed them promptly and they are very receptive, offering a full refund but I've been advised that I should be asking them to exchange what they sold me with what they had advertised. Telling them that, they reply that they did not input the information in the listing and the specs within the Description were ""automatically"" filled out by ebay, so there is nothing they can do in regards to exchanging. 

If I throw this at the resolution center are they just going to go with the full refund or actually force them to exchange to the model that I bought?",4,0,2013-05-30,EBAY,0.02036602795124054,0.9338971376419067,0.04573674872517586

Ebay,Paypal fees question?,"Maybe a dumb question but I'm a little confused. I sold an item on eBay for $610 so I have a 10% final value fee to pay of $61 that I understand. 

When I checked Paypal, the net amount I received is $586.86. That's only 96.2% of $610. Why did Paypal take about 3.8% fees. I thought it was supposed to be 2.9%...unless I'm missing something obvious?

Ebay,"Sorry if this is a common question, but what's the best way to minimize fees?","I've only sold on eBay a few times, and the previous time was quite a few years ago. I just sold something that I had laying around my house, and was surprised at all the fees eBay was racking up. They charged me 10% on my final value, *including* my shipping. Then, even though I owed them that amount, they sent the full amount to Paypal in order to maximize their Paypal cut, and then expect me to pay my fee invoice after the fact, from the money they just charged me a fee to take out. 

I feel like I'm being royally screwed over, but I suppose that's my fault for not reading up on their new policies. Anyway, is there any way to minimize all the fees that I'm paying? I suspect that eBay's final value fees are pretty cut and dry, but it's ridiculous that they charge me again for using Paypal. I see they offer a few other payment options (including ""credit card""), but I'm not familiar with them. Will any of them result in fewer fees than Paypal?
