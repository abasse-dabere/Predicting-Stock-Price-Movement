Ebay,Why I am done with eBay,"I began seriously selling back in December 2011 so I could make some extra cash. It began slowly, but eventually I got my account to a point where I was happy generating about $100 a week from sales. The vast majority of my customers were satisfied with the items I sold and the service I provided. In the thousands of sales I've done only a few ended with the customer not being happy. Any problems were resolved with both parties getting what they wanted. While eBay offered little buyer protection back then, selling on eBay was still tolerable. Then eBay decided to implement their new seller standards.

These new standards have forced me to stop my side business due to the poor planning on eBay's part regarding the seller standards. Many customers don't realize the impact of leaving a low rating or opening a case. They do this at the slightest problem or misunderstanding and even if it gets resolved, eBay marks it against you. That and their new return policies are ridiculous as the seller is basically forced to pay for return shipping regardless of why the buyer is returning it. In the past months I've noticed an increase in the amount of customers claiming that their item ""broke"" and they'd like a refund. I then would ask them to return the item, and in return they would receive a refund if the item was truly as they said it was. Numerous times they'd refuse to return the item and leave me negative feedback. Any time I'd contact eBay regarding this they would just tell me there is nothing they can do. It got to the point that I had enough and stopped my side business because the way that eBay deals with anything is ridiculous.

After closing my side business I didn't sell on eBay until recently. I created a new account for personal use just to get rid of some items I didn't want. It took me a while, but eventually I got rid of the 21 day fund limit. However, again eBay's seller standards ruined my selling experience. The items I was selling were brand new and were factory sealed. When I sold them a few of my customers left feedback and now I am once again limited since they ""weren't as described"" even though they were **brand new**. This made no sense to me so I contacted eBay yet again, and as usual they were of no help. 

Anyway I am done with my rant and just wanted to share my experience with eBay. Maybe they'll get it right one day, but honestly if they had any actual competition that had a site similar to eBay's but ran it better, I think eBay would tumble.

Tl;Dr- eBay's seller standards are terrible and eBay has lost yet another customer",23,17,2014-11-01,EBAY,0.09714441001415253,0.8668738007545471,0.035981763154268265

Ebay,"Buyer claims I sold him defective laptop 2 weeks ago, do I have any say in the return process?","Sold buyer a laptop that he got 2 weeks ago. Today he's claiming the DVD drive isn't working. It was working before I sent it to him because that's how I reinstalled the OS on the laptop. Either he broke it and he's lying or it got messed up during shipping. Anyway, he requested a refund and these are my options right now:

Refund screen only shows me 3 options:

* Accept the return - You'll pay for return shipping and can send our return label or send your own. Wait to get the item back before you refund the buyer.
* Refund the buyer - The buyer will keep the item, and you can fully refund the buyer to close this request.
* Offer a partial refund - The buyer will keep the item, and you have one chance to offer an amount.

It also says reply by Nov 5th. What happens if I don't? I'm guessing the buyer gets a full refund and keeps the item, right? I really need to know what happens if I miss the deadline because it's vital how I handle this. 

I think my best bet is to bite the bullet on the return shipping costs and give him a refund, so at least I'd have the laptop back. Thoughts?",5,3,2014-11-01,EBAY,0.0411161333322525,0.9136343002319336,0.04524964094161987

Ebay,"I built Denarri, the app that shops FOR you. I’d love r/eBays feedback!","As someone who has been both a buyer and seller on eBay for over 10 years, I can totally relate to the pain points felt by both sides. For a while, I spoke with friends and family about their online shopping experiences, and watched the discussions and complaints on Reddit very closely. Finally, I decided to do something about it and built Denarri. 


My goal was to get you from Search to Buy in 3 clicks. Like the Grand Exchange in Runescape (good times), you should tell it what you want, using your preferences it finds you the perfect match as soon as it’s listed, and bam, it’s yours.


Denarri solves these problems in 3 ways:


**1. Personalization:** It learns your preferences the more you use it, so you don’t have to go through the added steps of inputting criteria every time. Search for your favorite electronics, and it'll automatically know the price range, location, and condition preferences you have in mind for that category.


**2. MatchCenter:** All the items you're following in one place, no time consuming bidding necessary. It intelligently eliminates the noise and shows you only the best, most up to date matches, so you don't get overwhelmed with thousands of results, or have to search for multiple items every day. 


**3. Notification System:** It keeps a lookout and notifies you when new matches are found, based on how high priority the item is to you. Need it soon? It’ll notify you more frequently. Just browsing? It’ll update you with matches periodically, so you don’t miss out on deals, but don’t get swamped with notifications. 


You may be thinking “This is great and all, but how will it solve my pain points as a seller?”. Great question, that’s where all you great sellers come in! 


This phase of Denarri focuses on making the experience for buyers amazing. Phase 2 introduces selling functionality, and I want selling on Denarri to be awesome for you guys! I want to hear what you dislike about the current selling experience, and what your idea of the perfect marketplace would be like. 


Lower fees? More streamlined item listing? Better feedback system? A free tiger for every 10 items you sell? I’m all ears! :)


Special treat for Redditors, use invite code **REDDIT** to get 3 months of fee-free selling! **For every new user you invite, you’ll each get another 3 months of fee-free selling, and be entered to win a Nexus 7 tablet!** The more friends you invite, the more entries you get. Just have them put your username in the “invite code” field when signing up. Think of how much money you’ll save by inviting only 4 friends! :)

**Direct link to app:** https://itunes.apple.com/app/id917126419




**TL;DR: I built an app that does all the work of shopping for electronics for you. I think it’s pretty great. Any way I can make it even more great? I’d love to hear it. Selling functionality is coming soon, so tell me what the perfect selling experience would be like in your opinion, and I’ll build it for all you awesome people :)**",9,5,2014-11-03,EBAY,0.03491036221385002,0.9306709170341492,0.03441872075200081

Ebay,"Wife hasn't gotten a listing sale for over three months, customer service makes me wait two hours and tells me I'm out of luck.","My wife has been selling on Ebay for about six years.

Three months ago, however, she stopped getting those emails. She's part of several groups, however, where everyone else has continued getting them every single month like clockwork. For us, though, nothing.

We called Ebay Customer Service today, and after being on hold for two hours, getting shuffled back and forth from person to person, the end result (after speaking at length with the General Manager of the Sales Department) is that we're out of luck, nobody can tell us when we'll get invited to another listing sale, and- most infuriatingly- nobody can tell us why we stopped getting invitations.

According to the GM, the sales are sent out completely autonomously, based on criteria that, according to him, nobody knew and nobody could explain to us. He wouldn't let me speak to his supervisor (he gave me her first name, but would not transfer me and would not give me her email address). He basically told us there was nobody who could give us the information we wanted (specifically, nobody could tell us what criteria was used to determine who got listing sales) and that we should just keep waiting. This is after three months of waiting. And after two hours of being on hold.

Counterfeit items

If a buyer suspects that an item is counterfeit, and there are strong indicators that the item is counterfeit, we don't require the buyer to return the item to the seller. The buyer agrees to cooperate with us to ensure the proper disposal of the item. In such instances, we refund the buyer for the full cost of the item and original shipping, and the seller reimburses us for the refund. The buyer may not sell the item on eBay or elsewhere.

Ebay,"Buyer knowingly buys my ""for parts, not working"" item, doesn't read description and now threatens to give negative feedback if I don't pay the repair fee","On hindsight I should've repeated in every single line, in font size 30 and bold that the item was for parts.

I listed a phone as ""For parts, not working"" because it wasn't guaranteed to work but was worth salvaging because it looked almost brand new, especially the screen/LCD which is not cheap at all but easy to remove and reuse. I described all the details.

A week after delivery the buyer messages me saying the SIM card slot was broken (it wasn't) and that he got it repaired. After **20** messages of him saying we needed to come to an agreement (never specifying what and being completely vague) and threatening to give negative feedback if we don't, I get him to say the repair was $25.

He later gives the negative feedback and says he will remove it if I refund the $25 he paid for a repair I never agreed to. 

I don't understand. If the item was ""for parts, not working"" why should the seller have to be forced to pay repair bills? The phone was packed in the original box, wrapped in so much bubblewrap and sent via UPS with signature required. There's no way the SIM card slot was damaged on the way. He probably damaged it himself or is bullshitting to get me to fork over $25. In the feedback he wrote ""deceptive poor description"" which the listing was not. 

I don't want the negative feedback and $25 is a big setback for a listing I was only making a few dollars on.

Does anyone have any ideas?

Ebay,36 Minutes on Hold,"I spent 36 minutes on hold with Ebay yesterday attempting to get some defects removed. The rep at first said none of them were eligible. I protested that the latest defect was from a customer who opened an INAD case for an item bought for parts or repair. The listing said it was for P or R and that it was broken, but they obviously didn't read that and admitted so in Ebay messages. They eventually closed the case after saying it was their fault. (I know this is rare:  a buyer admitting fault.) 

After pressing, the rep agreed that defect was eligible, but kept putting me on hold for her to ""read"" and ""make sure,"" etc. I spent an inordinate amount of time on hold and just sitting there while she made noise with her keyboard and her coworkers laughed and chatted in the background (so unprofessional). 

She eventually transferred me to *another* department for that ""specialist"" to have a look at the case and remove the defect--WTH was I on the phone with her all that time if she couldn't remove it herself?  I had to wait for this person to come on the line, then they took like almost 10 minutes to read the case notes. She then asked me to describe the case (really? what were you reading all that time?) and took another 15 minutes to do stuff on her computer. During this time, she kept putting me on hold. 

She eventually said the defect would be removed and would show up the next day. It still isn't removed. I'll keep checking back, but if it hasn't fallen off by Saturday, I guess I'll have to call back again.

Ebay,Item being returned as 'defective' that was not defective when it was sent out,"So I sold a vintage digital alarm clock last weekend and prior to shipping, I pulled it out of storage, verified that it was still working and reset the time to Daylight Savings (thought it was a nice touch) before packing it up and sending it out.

Last night, I get a return request from the buyer with the stated reason being ""It's defective or doesn't work"" and the following note:
""The button used to set the hour for both time and alarm does not operate. The minute button does fine, but the hour is stuck. I can't set the clock.""

Now, I know, with absolute certainty, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that this item was in perfect working condition when I sent it out.  The button in question was actually used immediately before shipping it out (which is why I mentioned resetting it to Daylight Savings above).  While I understand that there is a chance that something may have happened during shipping, my money is on 'buyer's remorse'.

At this point, I am just waiting for the buyer to ship the item back.  I have not contacted them and am just waiting for the item to come back to me so I can see if it does actually still work.

My question is multiple parts.  First, should I make any attempt to contact the buyer about it?  Not sure exactly what I would say, I've never had someone initiate a return without contacting me first, so I am not sure if I should try contacting them or if I should just stand back and let HFR run the show.

Ebay,"Advice on Sticky Shipping Situation?! New-ish seller here, buyer with wrong address &gt;.&lt;","I've sold about 30 things on ebay so far, so I've got a pretty good feel about how it works, but I have encountered a problem:

I had an item sell last night, one of the most expensive ones yet, and the buyer immediately sent payment and their address, so I immediately packed the item, printed the label and requested pickup for today from the USPS. When I woke up this morning, I had an email from the buyer saying that their address was wrong/a relatives' address. They sent me their ""correct"" address in a message.

I am very good about stressing myself out if I can't solve a problem in a reasonable amount of time...

I feel like if I just wrote his ""correct"" address on a piece of paper and taped it over the ""wrong"" address on the current label, the delivery would get messed up because the barcodes will direct the package to the ""wrong"" address.

I could go in, change the seller's name and address and reprint but a) I'm not paying for shipping AGAIN, and b) ebay's seller's protection will be withdrawn if I veer from what was electronically put on the label by the buyer. I could void the label, which may/may not get refunded by the USPS a month later, then go in and type his ""correct"" address in, but again, seller's protection will be waved.

WHAT CAN I DO?! ebay's telephone customer service is closed for another 3 hours. I emailed the buyer but I don't forsee him having any suggestions on the matter.

Ebay,"Buyer claims item as not described, not sure if he's lying","Hey guys,

I've been buying and selling on eBay for many years, and have always been proud to have perfect feedback since I think it shows I try to be very honest and fair in my auctions, and helps with selling items.

However, I recently sold a video game console. The buyer made me uncomfortable from the get go saying he couldn't pay me right away because of some issues he was having and needed to wait, so I said no problem. After I received the payment, I shipped the item.

I heard back after delivery that he received the item and the console was missing its screws, and that I need to be honest with him or he will consult with pay pal.

I cleaning everything up and tested it all before selling, It's possible if the console was sealed together very well that there weren't screws as I can't specifically recall seeing them or not, but feel like I would have noticed them missing.

Either way, I apologized and said if he was not satisfied with the purchase, even though I don't usually accept returns I would in this case and refund him his money.

I'm still waiting for a response now but wanted to see if anyone has experience with customers returning items or having pay pal disputes, and what I can expect? Not going to lie I'm also nervous about getting negative feedback even though I'm more than willing to try and correct the situation, whether he was being honest or not about the screws.

Ebay,How does everyone calculate international shipping costs?,"Generally If an item is over 1lb 8ozs I charge between 9-20 shipping when its domestic. but there are lots of times I feel like I am missing out when I do not include international shipping. I use the global shipping program, but I find tons of people message me asking me for a discount, and I ask them their zipcode, calculate the price to that zip code, and its generally cheaper than what the global shipping rate would cost them.

I really don't know the HxWxL of the packaged item until it sells. depending on the location helps me decide what type of box to use. if its within the state I find a custom box is easier. if its across the united states the flat rate boxes sometimes are the cheapest option.

So i can't possibly figure out the exact weight/dimensions for the item because if it sells domestically the package size will differ.

How does everyone else determine the price? I mean it seems the price varies greatly from country to country so calculated price is the way to go. but How do you determine the dimensions/weight for the item? Does everyone just guess the box size and add an extra 3-15 ounces for the weight?",8,2,2014-11-09,EBAY,0.030993890017271042,0.9316092133522034,0.03739696368575096

It was awful and I want to switch back to the old style, however so far I haven't seen one. I actually gave up on bulk shipping after the switch because shipping each item individually ( ie making a label and printing it) was faster for me.

Ebay,"First, I was excited to start selling on Ebay, but I pay over 16.5% on fees. Pathetic. How would I save money?","I usually ship to other European countries from Czech Republic. Here's a list of fees I have to go through

- Bank currency conversion fee

Ebay,"I normally actually side with ebay, but this is ridiculous. (GSP Center liquidating my item)","Sold a used vintage carburetor to a young gent in the UK from here in the states.  After a week, the buyer asks me what's going on?  I check the shipping status, and it was put on hold at the GSP shipping center in Kentucky for 3 days.  Ebay never told me.  Then the status shows ""Undeliverable-SYSTEM_RESTRICTION"" which again, tells me nothing.  Sit on hold with ebay, they tell me the GSP has the carburetor, but for reasons he does not know they are keeping the carburetor, refunding the buyer, and I get to keep my funds.  The transaction is complete, the item will go to ebay liquidation.  I again ask why, he cannot tell me.  He states an email should have been sent to me, which it yet had not been.   All I could do was wait for that email.  Finally got it this morning.  Fairly generic, stating that the item is not legal for UK import.  Are you kidding me?  Guys in the UK don't repair vintage motorcycles, eh?  I did some research and saw 0 evidence of used motorcycle parts being illegal for them to import.  Call up ebay AGAIN, the GSP rep knows nothing, says he'll file a report for me and I have to wait another 24-48 hours to hear back.


I got my money.  I'm not one to feel personally spited by this.  For one though, my buyer had been discussing this purchase with me even before he bought it as he was very excited since he needs it to get his bike running and he has had trouble finding this.  He's told me repeatedly that he doesn't even care about the money, he wants the carb.  And they're going to trash it.


Second, they seized the buyer's goods because they believe it's not legal for him to import, yet they still have not contacted him at all about it.  Again, I got my money, but shame on you ebay.  Hell, maybe there is some weird import restriction, but the fact that you don't tell either party and instead seize the item, then have reps that have NO access to information, then make me wait 1-2 days every individual time I ask for information?

Ebay,Paypal dispute deadline going from 45 to 180 days on feb. 1st 2015 (in Europe). Thoughts?,"Of course most of you know about this since a while. Without trying to start a circlejerk about how eBay and Paypal suck and we are all going to stop using them (which might be a valid option for some), I'm wondering what experienced long time eBay sellers expect the outcome of this to be for their business. Do you believe this feature will be abused a lot and if so, in what way?

Also why exactly is Paypal doing this? Does it have to do with Paypal and eBay splitting up? Has this been ordered by eBay to further accommodate buyers? I mean for Paypal this shouldn't be an easy step to take, because it will cost them a lot more manpower and in some cases money. There is little benefit for them I would think.

The only reason I can think of that really validates raising the deadline at least some is when buying in China. As a buyer I somewhat regularly encounter that I HAVE to file a dispute because the 45 days are up, while the package may still arrive but has been severely delayed at customs. However usually when this happens, the package never turns up, but sometimes it does.

Ebay,Faulty product — reasonable to return to seller?,"Two months ago I bought a used fitness watch from a seller through a best offer. The condition he listed it as was ""New one month ago. Like new condition."" Within a few weeks of receiving the item though, I noticed what I deduced to be a manufacturer defect (extremely short battery life). I contacted the seller about it to ask for a copy of the original receipt so I could work out an RMA with the manufacturer, but the seller could not provide it. I've gotten as far along the manufacturer's RMA process as I could without the receipt, but of course they insist I need it to continue. I even tried going to my nearest location of the chain store the seller claims he bought the unit from, and though helpful, the store ultimately couldn't provide me with a receipt. 

The seller is responsive and cordial, but keeps insisting that he can't find the receipt. I let him know that the store he purchased it from could likely reprint it with no problem, but that hasn't led to anything.

I feel like I am running out of options, but here's what I think I'm left with:
1) Return the watch to seller — but is this reasonable?
2) Deal with the repair/replacement cost myself if the manufacturer allows me to continue without a receipt.

I was selling a mixer worth $100-$125 tops on the best day. I had relisted it a few times, dropping the starting price from $50 to $38. I got an email from a buyer asking if they could pick it up locally if they won. I said sure and they placed a bid with 5 days to go. I went to check my auctions with 16 hours left and saw the mixer was at $1025! I looked at the bid history and it was three bidders. The first bidder who contact me, one legitimate bidder with a bid of $40 or something like that and a third bidder with 0 feedback that had just joined that day. The first and new bidder had bid up to $1025.


I knew it was just bidder fraud (new bidder would cancel their bid and first bidder would have it without having to fight bidder #2) or someone messing with me. I decided to cancel the bids and the auction. After the auction was canceled I was able to see that bidder #1's proxy bid was $4,800...


A while later I looked at my account and it said I owed a $100+ final value fee for that auction..... I contacted customer support (India) and explained that it was clearly bidder fraud. The woman said that she would put a request in to her supervisor, but would not let me speak to them. Today I got an email back saying my request was denied. Help.


I can provide a link to the auction if it's allowed. I do $2500-$4000 a month in sales on ebay, but I will not take a $100 hit for bidder fraud.

Ebay,Just realized eBay is automatically leaving feedback for my buyers. Won't allow me to change the setting.,"Did anybody else realize this? I usually stop once a week to leave feedback for all my buyers who have left me feedback. Yesterday, when I went to do this, I realized that feedback had already been left for all my buyers who had already left me positive feedback.

Strange. I go into my automation settings only to find that an automation has been set up for ""Automatically leave the following positive feedback"".
and ...
"" Buyer has paid for this item and left me positive feedback."" and it won't let me de-select the automation!

Ebay,"HELP, business buyer wants a refund 3 weeks after buying 'faulty' PC item, no proof of deceit but mishandling likely","I sold a graphics about 3 weeks ago to what looked like a business seller with 30000 feedback. Because of this, I let my guard down (forgot to UV mark the card, take videos of it working, etc). It went smoothly, although they didn't leave feedback. 

Now I've got a message from eBay telling me they want to return it because it was 'dead'. Because of eBay's managed returns that came in during August, they can just return the item without asking me first. The thing about graphics cards is that a little bit of static electricity can kill them. They might have broken it or switched the serial numbers for one that wasn't broken (I've got pictures of serials but they're peel off stickers). The card is also one month out of warranty. It just seems weird to buy something and not leave feedback and not open or use it for 3 weeks.  

I told the buyer to get compensation through the delivery service (Royal Mail Guaranteed 1pm), but they haven't responded yet. 

What do I do? If they get their money back and I'm left out of pocket with a dead GPU, then this is the 3rd and final time selling on eBay has stung me. I've spent nearly £1000 over the past 3 months, but any time I try to make serious money, this stuff happens. The first time, a seller opened a case because his mother board arrived a day late, when he didn't request a faster delivery and I didn't promise him anything. I was stupid enough to refund his postage. The second time, I was a few minutes late travelling home and back to meet this buyer in person, and stupidly offered to give him a discount when I was on the train and he threatened to leave. I should have kept the item in my bag but I didn't think he would ask to meet that day.
After haggling, I realised that I lost the benefit of extra cash that comes with meeting in person.

This sale boosted my confidence in selling, but I can't take the stress anymore. I'll have to close my account to avoid funding and encouraging this practice if this turns out badly.

Ebay,"Sold a jacket on Ebay and it didn't go so well, any advice would be appreciated!","Hey Guys and Girls,

So I sold a $900.00 leather jacket on Ebay 6 weeks ago and the buyer is located in South Africa.  The buyer did not receive the jacket, and after some investigation on his part, it was discovered that the South African Post is currently in the midst of a strike, so no deliveries.  The South African Post also added ""items may be lost"" in the press release.

Great.

So now the buyer opened a ticket in the Ebay resolution centre saying the item was not delivered because of the strike.  However, I guess Ebay has the buyer protection that only lasts until Dec 1, so the buyer pressed for a final decision from Ebay.  Obviously, the decision was made in the buyer's favor and I must refund the money.

So now I'm out $900.00 and the jacket is likely sitting in a post office somewhere in South Africa.  The package was insured, but because there is a strike happening right now and the item isn't actually lost, I cannot claim the money.

The tracking information from Canada says ""item arrived in foreign country"" and the tracking info from South Africa says ""item On Route"".  There has been no change in the last 5 weeks.

So my question is:  what happens if the jacket is eventually delivered to the buyer?  He's been refunded his money, the case is closed, and if it is delivered I won't get any insurance money either!  And this could occur long past the 30-day appeal window Ebay has been so generous to provide.


**TLDR:  I sold $900 jacket on ebay, sent an insured package to South Africa where there is an ongoing post-strike.  Ebay awarded buyer with refund for a package that may not actually be lost, and if it is delivered I'm at the mercy of the buyer's good will.**",6,2,2014-11-17,EBAY,0.07561801373958588,0.8914076685905457,0.03297431766986847

Ebay,Shutting down in January...its been a long journey,"Hey guys, lurker here that just wants to share. I have been actively selling on eBay since 1999. Honestly, I loved Ebaying more than anything else in the world. I reached Powerseller status in 2006 and never looked back. I was a certified Trade Assistant and a PowerU eBay instructor, I was dumb enough to pay for the privilege of teaching eBay classes, taught them for free (to keep my ratings up) and I went as far as translating all the teaching materials into Spanish. I sat down with Griff and gave him some solid advice on how to expand into the Latin American and he blew me off when I told him that I wasn’t willing to share my Spanish Materials without compensation.  I bought hundreds of shares of Ebay at $15, $20, $25, $30 etc….share price didn’t matter when you believed so deeply in an organization.

I sell under a different ID (LaCorina if it matters) and this was my third ID. I trashed the first two. My first ID was a mess that I used to sell McDonalds Beany Babies and Police Patches. My second ID was banned (long story). I bought cigars on eBay before they were banned. I started selling my Police Patch collection, and then some used gear and then made a nice side business selling cigar box artwork.  Once I ran out of cigar box artwork I sold just about anything I could get my hands on.
I cringe now when I look back and see how excited and loyal I was to eBay. I thought it was the beginning of something huge for the little guy like me. Boy was I wrong…

Bottom line, eBay has lost its soul. Let me elaborate, eBay rewards the overseas sellers whom are just obliterating us while riding the State side sellers with all kinds of conditions to maintain Top Seller status. I don’t have to tell you that Top Seller Status is vital to saving on seller fees. EBay has always been my side business, I have a full-time career. But eBay keeps demanding more and more until running this business part-time has become unfeasible. I was a fan of denying the sellers the opportunity of leaving negative feedback, I thought, this was going to bring in buyers in droves. Before they made that change their where too many douchebag sellers that made feedback coercion an art form. But I was wrong again, this brought out all the shit bird buyers that know you have no remedy to a bad experience.  If you sell on eBay your screwed, someone can scam you and eBay will not only not care, the seller will add insult to injury by killing your feedback score. It only takes one or two negative feedbacks for a small seller to see your Final Value Fees skyrocket.

If you’re presently selling on eBay and you’re doing well then my hats off to you, it’s not easy keeping up. If you’re struggling take my veteran advice and look for greener pastures, it doesn’t get any easier and you need to seriously consider the return on investment of your time and efforts.  If I would have spent that time, energy, and enthusiasm on something more lucrative such as a Medical Degree or professional certification then at least I would have had something to show for it.

Either way, I’m tired and too old for this nonsense (I’m in my 40s’). If I could I would shake Pierre Omidyar hand and thank him for the wonderful ride. It was fun while it lasted.

Ebay,Negative Feedback from Buyer who NEVER PAID due to eBay Video Selection Error.,"So I listed a Nokia 108 featurephone, single SIM.

All was well, it sold, and then he never paid.  I contacted him over 4 times, he said nothing until finally I sent him a cancellation request at which point he seemed to flip out, start saying I listed it badly.

I looked over the listing and I wrote single sim in THREE places, however eBay selected a video review of a dual sim model as the video to feature on the page, something that clearly stated beneath it that it may not be representative of the item on sale.

So we go back and forth, I constantly ask for him to either refund me my eBay fees or accept the cancellation request.  He does neither.

I leave a (positive) feedback saying something along the lines of 'Bad buyer, never paid, took days to respond'.  He then started shouting that he would report me to 'the taxman' as my business isn't registered (lolwut?) so I of course, send back actual documents from HMRC about what needs to be registered and what doesn't.

He leaves a NEGATIVE feedback stating:
""incorrect and mix information ,quick to blame others and do bad feedback""

This is eBay's fault, yet I as a seller am not only out listing fees, I'm also now 97% positive feedback on my previous perfect eBay seller history (I've sold almost £700 of items on eBay in the past two years).  

So, I call eBay.  20 minutes on hold I get passed on to a decent bloke, we talk for 10 minutes and he says he'll cancel the order therefore refunding my final value fees (not listing fees) and tranfer me to someone who can remove the feedback.  One hour later (at 11pm) they close, I continue on hold for another 10 minutes.  Nothing.

I wasted 1 hour 40 minutes on the phone to get that feedback removed, I did nothing wrong.

The item sold the same day I relisted it.

Also, yesterday I check the buyer's feedback history.  Out of 5 feedbacks he left, 4 were negative.  One of the sellers quit eBay, the other three I sent an email too.

One responded stating he asked for a large discount to keep the item and then never responded again and left negative feedback, another asked me how to report him.  I believe both have reported him, haven't heard back from the other seller, who's far larger.

Wrong.

Ebay,Buyer requesting to see receipt before purchase? Am I being scammed?,"I am trying to imagine a way this could be used for some kind of scam, but I was contacted a few weeks ago by someone who wanted to buy an item of mine.

&amp;nbsp;

They requested a photo of the receipt as they said buyers in the past had said they had them but not included them, and they want to be sure there is warranty. They said they wanted to pay £500 right away as they needed it for their sons birthday.  

&amp;nbsp;

Since the item in question was £450 at the time, I agree'd and sent them a picture of the receipt. At first they claimed they had not got it, then followed up saying they had and would let me know if they still wanted it.

&amp;nbsp;

I heard nothing. The item sold.

&amp;nbsp;

A few weeks later, I had listed another similar item. Though I had changed my eBay username too -which would be unrelated- if not for the fact that the SAME person sent me another email. Similar story.

&amp;nbsp;

They wanted the item for their sons birthday, could they see the receipt before they pay. I replied they actually sent me a similar message a few weeks ago, and they responded that they knew and I never replied so they didn't buy it. After a few emails of denial they finally admitted I had sent them an email, they just forgot, but they saw the item cheaper elsewhere so didn't buy it. However that trader was a scammer so they still need one.

&amp;nbsp;

Ok. So they say they def want this one. But when can I show them the receipt so they can call and confirm with the store that I purchased it....

&amp;nbsp;

I replied saying this was unreasonable, the store wont give them any information like that unless I gave them more personal details of mine. Which I was not prepared to do, and they would just have to trust me and my feedback.

&amp;nbsp;

They sent a final message saying that they wouldn't contact the store, but can they still see a receipt.

&amp;nbsp;

I send a photo of the receipt, but black out the order number and my address/tel number etc.

Just got an email back from them, saying ""no no I need the order number"".....

Ebay,How vulnerable am I as a seller?,"So I just sold a new phone on eBay and shipped the sucker immediately (earlier tonight). My question is... after scanning through numerous horror stories, how bad is it really for sellers? I've now officially freaked myself out...as a buyer, can they seriously just claim something as simple as ""item not as described"", get a refund and also keep the item? Keep in mind the phone I sold is brand new so not being ""as described"" would mean I shipped something entirely different which I obviously didn't. 

I see stores of people with accounts since 1999, 10s of thousands of positive feedback and eBay siding with buyers who have feedback totals of 2 (or something stupidly low in comparison). 

I guess at this point I'm super paranoid and would rather put a stop on the shipment, refund the buyer while I still can and basically forfeit my eBay account (since I'm sure they'd close it after the transaction falls through). 

I've had my account for 15 years but I'm VERY low volume user (total of about 50 feedback - 100%). This particular buyer has had their account for about the same and has about 70 feedback - 100% also. I checked their ""feedback left for others"" and didn't see any red flags.

In the event that they do try any scamming, what should I do? PayPal did say my transaction was ""Seller Protection"" eligible but I'm not sure what that even means. 

Are there any **success stories** of sellers getting their money and/or item back from a fraudulent buyer that tried some funny business? I'm already shocked at the 10% fees eBay now charges. If this deal turned sour and I was left high and dry for $1000+ I would be absolutely done forever with eBay (I know they wouldn't miss my business, but I imagine policies like this would eventually be the downfall of them if it's as bad as some indicate).

Ebay,Am I just screwed as a seller in this situation?,"Hello everyone. Just looking to see if anyone could help me out with a  little advice. I sell the occasional item on ebay and am completely baffled by whats currently happening. 

About a month ago I sold an HTC One M8 which was in perfect working and consmetic condition. I sold it used / as is with no refunds as with most used items. The buyer used the phone for almost an entire month and then contacted me saying ""The phone was in perfect condition when I received it, but I think the power button is now broken and doesn't work every time and there may be some scratches now"" (somewhat broken english). 

So, If i send someone a perfectly working item and they broke it (which I suspect is the case) now I have to refund them the money, and I receive back a broken item that I cannot resell thus making me selling something on ebay the equivalent of putting 400 dollars in a barrel and burning it?

I have had several conversations with different customer service reps at ebay which have ended in them (in not so many words) saying to take the item back there is nothing they can do. They reference walmart using the logic ""if you bought something at walmart you could return it"" to which I responded that people don't buy used items that say no refunds at walmart.

Its now been escalated to ebay and is under the 48hr review. Is there anything I can do during this time to state my case? I think there is an appeal process but the last rep I spoke to said something to the effect that I have to take the phone back even if i submit an appeal which makes me think its a joke.

Ebay,"Defect rate on the brink, any advice?","I was evaluated on the 20th Nov, and due to the high number of INR cases (non-deliveries from Royal Mail which I posted about the other day) my defect rate is now 4.57% and I have the little orange warning flag. So a couple of questions:

1) Will I have until the 20th December to push my defect % down, regardless of what happens before that date?

2) Should I lower my margins, try sell more volume to push my defect % down?

All of my open cases were resolved with the buyer, usually with a full refund. The whole defect rate is frustrating when you do everything you can (despatch promptly with signed for delivery, communicate with your buyers to close cases etc.) and the defect still counts. 

What would be nice if prior to opening an INR case, the buyer was first forced to message the seller. We should have 24-48 hours to resolve the problem with the buyer (which I'm certain the majority of sellers would be happy to do). After 24-48 hours the buyer would have the option to continue with the INR case, or mark the case as resolved. If the buyer wishes to continue with the case after 24-48 hours, then the 24-48 hours is reduced from the amount of time the buyer can escalate to eBay (""time served"" sort of thing). This would save a lot of sellers defects, and the buyer has nothing really to lose.

Ebay,"Buyer demanding partial refund to avoid ""reporting to Ebay."" Is this feedback extortion?","A buyer purchased a new in box item from me a month ago. This weekend she messaged me THREE times with variations of a demand for a partial refund due to the item being used, not in its bags inside the box, etc. 

I responded to her saying the item most definitely was new and that I didn't even open the box because the item was NEW. I don't accept returns, but I suspected she was totally full of it, so I told her to return it in its original packaging for a full refund. I told her once I checked the lot and serial numbers against our records, I would issue the refund.

Lo and behold she has discarded the package because ""it tore"" while she was opening it. Now, if you received an item not as described would you a) discard the packaging and b) take a month to contact the seller c) wait until just before Black Friday to make outrageous claims about a ""dishonest"" and ""fraudulent seller?""

Again, she is demanding a partial refund in a specific amount or she is going to ""report me to Ebay."" She never specifically mentions feedback, just reporting.

I am not inclined to give her a partial refund because I know she is lying. I'm sure she has been using this item for a month and now wants to shop after Thanksgiving with the money she spent on it. How likely am I to win any case she opens? What should my next step be? Can someone link me to an Ebay policy page outlining how the buyer has to return the item in original condition, etc. etc. The Ebay site is glitching from my end and won't open a lot of the pages, including my seller list in My Ebay.

-------------------------------------------------------------

I am an occasional eBay seller, but mostly buyer, most of the time from the Hong Kong area. I think in the last year I had perhaps 40 transactions with 4 to 5 Paypal disputes (sometimes escalated to claims). I have one dispute pending at the moment.

As a seller, I'm glad Paypal at least monitors this behavior from buyers. As a buyer, I realize it's probably a high percentage. On the other hand, stuff from China does tend to get lost a lot. I believe Chinese mail and customs just destroy or steal packages if they feel like it. The open dispute even has a tracking number that has been stuck at Chinese customs for 3-4 weeks now.

When opening disputes I notice Chinese sellers tend to do *anything* except refund. They'll offer to give small partial refunds, resending the item without cost (which is a scam afaik) etc. In the end usually I have to cut through their bullshit and file a claim.

Anyway, kind of wondering how to take this message and what steps can I expect Paypal to take if this continues? I read the mail, but I'm wondering what they'll actually do when I continue to file legitimate INR cases. Or what can I do to prevent some of these?

Ebay,Was I scammed and can I do anything about it?,"Last week I sold an item on eBay for the very first time. I got the email from ebay, printed out the shipping label, and sent it off. In my haste I didn't realize that I had to receive the money before shipping. The USPS tracking shows it as delivered, but the buyer says I'm trying to scam him, he said,
 ""Dude I'm not for that scam shit neither do I do it you have no feedback I gave you a chance by bidding then you try and scam me out if some shoes saying you shipped when you obviously haven't I buy all the time and things mainly go smooth but every now and then people try and scam like I don't know the game"" 

I gave him the tracking number the other day and he said thanks. But all of a sudden I am a scammer and I haven't shipped it? Is there anyway this might actually be a misunderstanding, or did I just get scammed out of $240. Can I call local law enforcement?",30,5,2014-11-26,EBAY,0.03907262533903122,0.9303979873657227,0.030529389157891273

Ebay,A quick question,"So I'm a new ebay seller, decided I didn't want to lose money because my the local market is currently in the dumps for what I'm selling, so 2 times now I've posted the same item and it's sold twice, someone buys it using the buy it now button, great that was fun. Being an experienced buyer I know how the payment process works, but both times the buyer messages have almost been identical, and read something like as follows:

""Hi I'm so glad I won your item, if you could send me an email with item condition, the total cost that I owe you and your PayPal email address in a message to ithinkyourestupid@scam.com and I'll pay you the amount owing""

Once I send the invoice with all the info they ask for minus my paypal address, and in a nice message explaining costs, condition, how to pay using the pay now button in the invoice, a matter of a few hours later I get an email saying an unauthorized user used the account to purchase the item and the sale has been cancelled

This is twice now and it's becoming a real pain in the butt, I've searched for tips and guides pertaining to this situation but can't find anything, do any of you vets have some tips to get me started, I've tried the eBay seller guides and stuff and this is where it's led me, TIA",9,4,2014-11-26,EBAY,0.0548042468726635,0.9185041785240173,0.02669152244925499

Ebay,Layaway issue regarding handling time.,"So, a buyer wants to pay on layway.  We agreed upon the terms and payments.  I asked for their email so I could send an invoice for the first payment.  Instead of doing this, they *accidentally* paid all at once and asked me to refund them for the difference.  For example, lets say the item was $100 and they intended to pay $20 but they paid the whole $100 so I refunded them $80.  

What I'm wondering is, will this screw up my handling time?  Because they paid in full a couple days ago, does the payment date start from a couple days ago?  When they pay this off in mid December will I have shipped this thing super late?  

Basically I'm asking if an item counts as ""paid"" if it was paid then partially refunded.  

Thanks  :)

**EDIT**  Sorry, it looks like I didn't provide enough information:  

1.  The buyer has over 1600 feedback and the account is 17 years old.  They have a history of buying similar items (antique/vintage dolls).

2.  All comunication has been through ebay and so far, payment done through eBay.

3.  I know layaways are technically against eBay policy.  In my business, antiques, layaways are a common scenario I'm willing to deal with.

4.  I know it's shady that the person *had* all the money to pay but didn't.  Buyers in my business do shit like that.  Sometimes they essentially treat me like a bank by depositing money into their layaway, then asking for it back to buy someone else's item.

Ebay,Suspiciously good deal,"Greetings everyone!

I found this offer for Audio Technica ATH-M50x headphones for $136.50. Now, I know that's insanely good price for headphones this good, but it gets better, the shipping is free, and to me it just seems too good to be true. There is a previously listed price of $182.00.

He sold 16 units in 24 hours, and has 10 available. I've been watching this item for some time now (more than 24 hours) and I noticed that the number of available units cca. 18 hours ago came to 3 or something like that, and then it got back up again to more than 10 units. In the description seller claims that it is 100% genuine product. But, since the product is shipped from Hong Kong, and it excludes shipping to many, let's say respectable countries (Australia, Canada, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, to name a few) I'm highly suspicious about this deal. I would really like to buy these headphones, but something tells me that they might be fake or that I could experience some other problems.

Also, this seller has other deals that are equally good, much lower prices than others, and also with free shipping.

Ebay,How do I cancel a return request from a buyer?,A buyer opened a return request but never sent the item (because they're a scammy piece of shit and want money because they claim they are in a place where the item didn't ship to - yes I reported them) so the request stays open. It's been there for 9 days now. Does it just go away automatically or will said request stay forever there? Can I cancel it?,2,5,2014-11-30,EBAY,0.1434045284986496,0.8332326412200928,0.023362791165709496
Ebay,Why do gift cards go for more than face value?,I have noticed most gift cards $200 and under sell for more than their worth.  I don't understand and can't think of any reasons for this.  Any ideas?,4,4,2014-11-30,EBAY,0.06380831450223923,0.9086284637451172,0.027563199400901794
Ebay,So what's up with searching books on eBay?,The book search seems to have changed recently. I used to be able to search and see a page with the book and then auctions connected to that book and now this no longer works. It has become much more difficult to see all the auctions of a specific title or ISBN. If eBay wants to compete with amazon they really need to fix this crap.,3,2,2014-11-30,EBAY,0.10605853796005249,0.8649541139602661,0.02898736670613289
Ebay,Iffy buyer refund. I'd really appreciate some advice.,"A buyer sent me photos of rips on the seams of the coat he bought from me that I do not remember seeing when I sent it out. He said my coat isn't new but it definitely is, he also said the arms have obvious signs of wear but he refused to send pictures as proof (I have pictures of the coat arms and they are pristine) I tried to be nice and accept his return because I did not want to be given bad feedback but now he is insisting that I pay a refund without him sending the item back first. The return page says that I shouldn't send a refund until I have the item back in my possession. I am new to selling on eBay and I want to make sure I do everything correctly. He said he is going to contact eBay customer service too but said it as a threat.

I'm happy to take the coat back but from being suspicious about the ""rips"" in the seams of the coat to now him demanding I refund first I am really worried I've been taken in on some sort of scam. I'd really appreciate any advice you guys can offer.

Thanks",6,2,2014-11-30,EBAY,0.08658868074417114,0.8590417504310608,0.05436958372592926
Ebay,Return help?,"Return on a PS3 I sold over a month ago...

Buyer sent back item but wrote note that said ""misplaced the HDMI cord and bout a new one for you"" from day one since getting a return message the buyer has been iffy and I was just wondering is it even legal in ebays code to do stuff like this? What should I do? Call eBay and say the package came back not as I sent it? What will happen from there? I'm just frustrated with this whole return and this just made it more stressful seeing I paid a decent sum for they HDMI cord a year ago..",9,2,2014-11-30,EBAY,0.0367748849093914,0.8961253762245178,0.06709976494312286

Ebay,Item not received,"Hey I just received this message from a buyer with 0 seller feedback and  136 buyer feedback.  They have been an ebay member since 2001.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm really sorry but is didn't get this package.
&gt;  I've never had this problem before and I ship hundreds of packages a year via USPS too. Tracking indicates it was delivered to my mailbox on November 22nd but I never got it and I usually pickup my mail as soon as it arrives at the box.
&gt; Do we have any recourse via Ebay?

How should I proceed from here?  Will them filing a claim for not receiving an item impact my seller metrics?  Thanks for your help everybody.",3,1,2014-11-30,EBAY,0.04079819098114967,0.8954130411148071,0.0637887716293335
