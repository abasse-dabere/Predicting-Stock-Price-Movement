Ebay,Buyer scammed me with a little help from ebay. Possible solutions?,"To make this quick and easy i was just scammed by a buyer, he requested a return because the item was ""defective"". I tested the item before listing, and again before packing it up worked great like it always has. I wrapped the item liberally in bubble wrap and surrounded it by packing peanuts in a sizable box, i highly highly doubt that the item arrived broken.

With that said i had no issues issuing a refund, i first asked for any sort of proof the item arrived defective, i received no reply. The case was then escalated and automatically decided in the buyers favor. According to ebay due to a ""glitch"" he was not able to print out a return label, i was never notified of this fact, as the buyer had never replied to any of my many inquiries regarding the item being returned. Today i receive an email stating the case had been closed and the buyer refunded, still no tracking or response from said buyer.

After calling ebay i was given the run around for about 30 minutes, they were not of any help in appealing the case. Even though they admitted they never notified me of this supposed glitch with the return label, i was told i was responsible for getting the buyer to send back my item in time... Yet the buyer never responded to any of my message inquiries regarding the return. 

Has anybody had any experience like this and is there anything i can do to get my item back?",6,12,2015-11-01,EBAY,0.04202746972441673,0.9180077314376831,0.0399647131562233
Ebay,"Seller hasn't accepted payment. I just want out, don't want a mark.","I bought and paid for an item two weeks ago.

This was only a few days after I paid for it, it's been 2 weeks since then.

They still haven't done anything and I just don't want the item anymore, this person hasn't made any attempt to contact me or fix the issue. I can't escalate a case because ebay doesn't show that I have paid for the item even though paypal shows the payment as not being accepted.

Ebay,International Buyer - Ukraine,"I'm stupid.  I agreed to sell a new Apple Watch to a guy in Ukraine.  $500

I figured that by paying the $70 to insure the shipment I would be covered.  Wrong.

It was new in the box, stills sealed, I took pictures of it along with the serial number, took pictures of the shipment, documented it all with USPS and sent it on its way.


Naturally, the guy claims that the package arrived tampered with, and ""item not as described"" and that it's not turning on.  I see in a message he sent to ebay that ""it has a blue wristband instead of white and it is not silver it is black, item not as described"" which is impossible because it was literally sealed in the box, brand new.


Whatever, fine, I start the insurance claim and ask him to send pictures and we'll start the return process.  He sends me pictures of the shipping box, which doesn't help.  I ask for pictures of the watch and he says something about ""I don't understand why you need pictures of the watch, it's not damaged it just is not as described, I want my refund.""  I explain why I need pictures of the watch and he ignores me.  While trying to figure out how to pay for the return shipping, I request pictures several more times and he ignores me.


Over the course of the next 2.5 weeks we discover that nobody will let me pay for a return shipping label from his part of the Ukraine.  I try to send him money for the return shipment via paypal and Paypal gives me an error saying his account cannot accept money.  He claims to call them and ask about it, but that Paypal will not enable his account to receive money.  Still he ignores my request for pictures, and is painfully slow to respond to messages.


Time runs out and ebay of course rules in the buyer's favor and gives him his refund.  I call ebay and they say to call them back after I receive the insurance claim ruling, if the insurance won't pay for it.  Then they will look at the case and consider an alternative solution.


I just received my letter saying ""The foreign postal administration of ukraine did not verify any damage or rifling to your article.  Therefore, no claim for indemnity can be authorized.""


I figure I get 1 shot at convincing eBay to rule in my favor.  Advice?  What are some key phrases I should say or policies I can cite?  Has anybody had any success with anything similar?",3,1,2015-11-01,EBAY,0.041934043169021606,0.9232842326164246,0.03478173166513443

Ebay,How on earth do I upgrade to a seller account?,"According to this link in ebay community:

https://community.ebay.com/t5/Starting-an-eBay-Business/Cannot-list-any-Item-as-selling-limit-is-0-00/qaq-p/23450610

&gt; Regular accounts are not sufficient to sell items, they can only be used to purchase.
 
&gt; You need to upgrade your account to a seller account. eBay has to have a back up payment method, and you also need to upgrade your paypal account to a premier account so you can accept credit and debit cards.

Alright, so I tried setting up a backup payment method here:

https://arbd.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?SetupCCPayment&amp;v2redirectpage=955&amp;guest=1

But it's not showing up, even if I wait 10 minutes and refresh the page.  Meanwhile, I go to paypal and there isn't a premier account option anymore -- did paypal change ownership?  The only other account option is a business account.  Does this mean you have to be a business to sell on ebay now?

* Posts from newly created accounts will be removed automatically. This discourages SPAM and the use of throwaway accounts. 
* Do not solicit others to sell items for you. This is a known scam and you will be banned.
* Posts from YouTube, Facebook, Google+ and similar social media sites will be removed as they often contain SPAM. This is also to keep things clean in the comments and posts.

Ebay,What can I do if I received a fake flash drive? (more than 60 days ago),"Hi,
So around 2.5 months ago I ordered a flash drive (I was preparing for an eight week stay at place with no internet connection), the product arrived, and I- like the mook that I am- didn't think to run any thorough benchmarks on it. I just looked at Windows property tab, confirmed that indeed it was the size that I wanted, went on with copying the files that I needed for my absence and continued packing.

Low and behold, right when I needed that information the most I found out that I can't retrieve it and the #%^#@# b%#%^@@% sent me a fake  memory. 
I have returned home several days ago, downloaded H2testw, found out I really have only 22MB on flash and you know what? I'm not even angry anymore.  I'm just weary and all  want is my money back, not even a compensation (although I should have one).

What can I do?
 I know I can't complain to Ebay  since it's been too long, and I doubt the seller would respond  since he obviously scammed me...

Any ideas?

Ebay,USPS Sent a Package Without my Consent,"So basically this is just a USPS rant. Lesson learned: don't issue a refund until the item is physically in your hands (not PO box or mailbox) - even with a long vacation. 

- 10/4: a few hundred dollar sale

- 10/5: shipped 2-day priority with signature confirmation 

- 10/13: package returned to me, 'adressee unknown', buyer says address is correct. I remail. (I inform if anything goes wrong, I will be out of town so the third mail will be delayed.)

- *(10/16-10/27: I was out of town.)*

- 10/17: Package is returned to me AGAIN. It's sitting in my PO box. Buyer wants me to ship to different address. I refund his money and advise him to recheck out with the correct address, I will remail for the third time when I return. (He never responded or repaid.)

- *I don't bother looking at the tracking again. It's in my PO Box waiting for me.*

- 10/18-10/23: Package sits in my PO box, while i'm out of town.

- 10/24: USPS worker decides to remove the package from my PO box and remail the package a third time without my consent. (Can they even do this? What the hell?)

- 10/28: Return from vacation, expecting to pick up the package. USPS worker is so proud of herself - says something along the lines of 'I knew that package needed to get to the destination so I resent is as a shadow(?), so they can just pick it up at their post office.' (My heart sinks. I'm out the money and the item. Why was a package sent without my consent? Why didn't we do the the shadow the second time?) I freak out. Demand I need the item. I inform them I refunded the money because it said it was in my PO box. USPS worker doesn't apologize. Management shows no sympathy and wants me out because I'm holding up the line. We contact the buyer's post office. (The buyer had 2.5 days to pick up the package - a notice was left at his house.) Luckily, he hasn't picked it up yet. Item is returned to sender - me. 

- 10/31-11/1: Arrives and departs my city sort facility. It's in transit back to buyer again (4th time). Apparently they got confused when reading/scanning on what address it was supposed to go to. It must still have the shadow thing(?) on it. 

- Today, 11/2: Contacted USPS customer service with this whole story. They assured me that shouldn't have happened and won't happen again. There was no reason to send it a third time, the 4th time was an accident. Management (that was super rude during the incident) is supposed to contact me with more information regarding my package.

I just want the item in my hands! Such a nightmare. It's almost been a month. ""2-Day delivery"" sigh. Has this happened to anyone before? Do I have any rights/actions to take?

Ebay,Is it possible to do something like this?,"First off, I'm very new to eBay as a whole, so I'm not sure if eBay already has this sort of functionality implemented on their site or not.

Basically, I would like to know if something like this exists on eBay/third party website elsewhere. I don't know what you'd call it, but I can roughly describe how it'd work: say I provide keywords that can narrow listed items down such that they're mostly relevant to what I'm looking to bid on. This service will then keep watching on eBay using these keywords and then notifies me of any ending auction, where I can then individually look into it to see if a) it is a relevant item and b) the offer is still well below the maximum I'm willing to bet.

It is most likely just a watchlist program/website/add-on, except that it'll crawl eBay for those auctions for me, instead of having me browsing through eBay and manually add individual auctions into the list myself. Does anyone know if something like this exist?

I have a decent rating, but all in low double digit feedback (think 20-40).  Will people be especially wary if I'm listing big ticket items, things like older Lego sets?

Ebay,What is going on with eBay?,"I'm about to scream with the eBay issues I am having today.

I bought an item due to be delivered on the 29th October, it never arrived, so I sent a polite message (which triggered the case) asking if they could advise.

On the 3rd November the case was closed because the seller contacted eBay with tracking, but I wasn't given it.

I called today and was given the tracking number and told there is nothing I can do, I can't contact the seller or leave negative feedback.

The tracking number shows it being sent back to seller but on the 3rd when they responded. It looks really scammy but eBay won't do anything, what do I do?

Ebay,ebay sellers who generate UPS labels via ebay/paypal interface...,"For years, I have sold on ebay, and direct via paypal. Way back when I set my paypal account up, I set up a UPS shipping account on the paypal site. I've always generated my UPS labels on paypal.com to get the discount there. 

I ship many large and odd sized items. Sometimes I have to construct or modify packaging to fit. Sometimes the items are dimensionally just under the threshold for the next size class...for instance a 56 x 28 x 9 package that might ship for $65 is just one or two inches away from being bumped into OS2 class which would then cost $120. Occasionally this comes into play when the UPS automated scanners decide that my package is actually one or two inches longer on one side than it actually is. So they will say that the package is actually, for instance, 59 x 28 x 9, and that I should have paid the much higher OS2 rate.

So then at that time they process an ""adjustment"". So on a random sunday, I will see a charge hit my paypal account, from UPS, without warning or notification, for the difference between what I originally paid, and what they think I should have paid. For instance the most recent charge was an extra $59.xx. 

Then I have to take the transaction reference number from my paypal statement, manually email UPS CS, and inquire with them to cross reference what tracking number the charge is related to and why. It always comes back that they've inflated the dimensions by 1-3 inches on one or two sides, and they use this to justify the huge charge. It is noteworthy that UPS actually got class action sued for this exact behavior in 2010-2011 (see barber v. ups) and settled for 2 million dollars. 

It has gotten so bad in the past 2-3 years that when I am shipping a suspect package, I will actually place it on the floor and hold the measuring tape up against each of the 3 dimensions, and take a picture of each. Then if there is an adjustment in dispute, I go back in the paypal records and find the dimensions that I originally paid for, compare them to my pics to be sure they match, and then email UPS CS yet again to dispute the charges. I upload the pics of the measurements to a photobucket account and give them the links to view. 

Although cumbersome, usually this serves as sufficient proof for them to credit the erroneous adjustment charges back to me within a few days.

Recently I have this same situation but now for whatever reason they are adamant that they will not credit the erroneous adjustment charge back to me. I have corresponded with two email CS reps as well as the person claiming to be my ""account rep"" and all of them said that ""someone higher up"" has told them that the charges will stand in spite of my photo evidence proving the dimensions of the package I sent out were accurately entered and paid for. The account rep even said that I am doing everything right and that I should keep documenting the dimensions as I am doing, but that they will not credit this charge back to me. 

I'm still going to pursue that issue, but looking forward...does anyone have experience or ideas to keep this from happening? 

I figured out that I can to go ups.com and print the labels there, and still get my account discount earned via my paypal account, as long as I enter my shipper number to associate with the shipment. I then have the option to bill the label costs (and any subsequent adjustments will follow the same billing path) to a future UPS invoice. But all that means is that instead of billing the adjustment to my paypal account, they send me a paper bill for it and threaten to send it to collections if I dont pay for the adjustment voluntarily. 

For the past few weeks I have started billing these shipments to an actual credit card, so that if they hit me with an adjustment I will at least have the possibility of chargeback protection via my bank after I explain the situation. I'm still not sure if I would win or not even with clear evidence, because the situation is so convoluted. 

I am now thinking of setting up a prepaid credit card and only adding a small amount to it every time I need to charge a UPS label. Then later on if UPS tries to ding that same payment card for an adjustment, oh too bad, it gets declined because of insufficient funds. But I don't risk my credit or bank account. However I'm not sure how truly anonymous these prepaid credit cards are, or if this plan would work out like I think.",7,3,2015-11-05,EBAY,0.049862779676914215,0.9092038869857788,0.04093329608440399

Ebay,Bought item from seller that wasn't same item in photo. Seller got really defensive and am worried.,"I bought a Gameboy that was supposedly excellent condition. Heck, the photos made it look like a beaute. Original serial number. The 1800 number on the battery cover. The works. Now, I posted here about a week or 2 ago worried about sellers not shipping on time. The seller FINALLY shipped it a week later. Before hand he had messaged me because I had asked him kindlt when he expected to ship and also better photos of the screen. Well. I was supposed to get it the 22nd of Oct. I recieved it the 30th. As soon as I opened it I knew it wasnt the exact one. Called eBay and everything. I messaged the seller informing them, maybe thinking they sent the wrong device (I had a problem earlier in the week after a seller sent me the wrong power cord for a game console, so I assumed it was maybe an accident) The seller got really defensive saying that what he sent me was the item as described. That I was supposed to get back to him 3 days after the expected arrival date and since I didnt get back to him until a week later when it ACTUALLY arrived he claimed that I defaced the item and he can't be sure I didnt do the damage myself. He told me I should feel extremely lucky I got such an amazing deal because he had individuals messaging him saying theyd buy it at a higher price then what i paid and I should try reselling it myself. This item was in terrible condition. The seller told me hed refund me if the item was what he sent me. I already called eBay and started the return/refund process but I'm terrified I'll send the item back. He'll lie and say that I sent him a completely different item and Im out $35 and a Gameboy.

Ebay,Received previous generation of described bicycle wheelset - how to proceed?,"Hi all,


I won/paid for an Ultegra 6800 wheelset (RRP £399.99) on Sunday after winning the auction, and since receiving the wheels yesterday it has become apparent that the wheels are the previous generation's model.


While the changes appear to be minimal, I'm a bit miffed as I bidded in the knowledge that I was getting the up to date version - not the previous generation with main identifying stickers removed.

Another issue is that the bearings in the 'excellent' quality wheels appear to be worn, with audible and tactile feedback coming from the wheel spinning. I work in a cycle shop and know this to be a sign of poor bearing condition, so hope to examine this in full tomorrow.

I have sent the seller a message detailing all of this and asking for an appropriate resolution - is there anything else you would advise? I paid £160 inc. postage, so would a reduction of £40 (presuming the bearings are okay/fixable) be appropriate?

Ebay,February seller ratings preview available - on-time delivery now an issue.,"Maybe I missed a message on this, but you can now see your seller status as if it were by February standards just by clicking on the ""seller level"" link.

This is regardless of if you shipped on time. When I looked at mine, sure enough there was a ""ding"" against me, and ironically it was an item I had to re-ship due to returned / refused (USPS error). 

I thought we were covered when we shipped on time, but it looks like we are screwed if an item is delayed. Anyone else???

Update - I called eBay and they removed the defect. A live person can quickly see the history, but an automated system does not.

Ebay,"Sent package to buyer, now it's coming up as deliverable. What do I do now?","A buyer purchased an electronics item from me for about $100.  She then message me asking if I could delivery to a different address because she is moving at the end of the month.  I told her that I could only delivery to the verified paypal address.  I suggested we cancel the transaction, she change her paypal address, then I would then repost the ad.  She declined saying she used her bank account, and it would take days for the money to go back.

So I offered her the only other suggestion I could.  I told her that I would send it to the verified address, and she would have to go to the post office and get them to forward any mail to the new address.  She agreed she would do it the next morning.  I am not sure if she did, but looking at the USPS website, it says it will take a few days to take effect.  So there's that. 

I check the status of the delivery today and it says ""Your item was undeliverable as addressed at 8:42 am on November 5, 2015 in **********. It is being returned if appropriate information is available.""

I googled around for past 30 minutes and such mixed answers. True Ship says it's fine: http://www.trueship.com/articles/can-i-use-a-flat-rate-box-to-ship-priority/ But figured I would ask just in case.

Ebay,How to charge postage PER item,"Hi,

I'm a casual seller, but this week I created an item listing (for sale). The listing was of the Buy Now type, and the postage was fixed. In addition, the item is heavy. Since I had 4 of this item, I set the quantity to 4. Today a buyer comes along and buys all 4 items in a single transaction (great), but the postage paid was only for the fixed postage to post a single item. I had mistakenly assumed that a buyer would be charged x4 for the postage for buying 4 of the items. Looking back at creating a new listing, in the future how can I set a fixed postage price PER item (not a fixed postage for 1, 10, or even 100 items)? I don't see this option available. In the future should I just create different listings? This seems to be a flaw/oversight in the ebay system.",4,3,2015-11-07,EBAY,0.03569374606013298,0.9272884130477905,0.03701779991388321
Ebay,New to ebay selling -- Auction on an item closed. Buyer is asking me to ship to a different address than the one on file w. ebay when I click on Send Invoice. How do I proceed?,"I hope this isn't too basic a question, but I've been reading through ebay and PayPal help screens all morning and can't seem to get a clear answer on this.

An auction finished last night, and first thing I hear from the buyer is a note saying that they want it shipped to New Jersey, and want free shipping.  Now, for some reason, the shipping calculator on the auction page wasn't working in the lead up to closing, and I had a lot of people messaging me their zip codes to get updated estimates.  I assumed it was the case for my buyer, though what's hinky is that I wasn't offering free shipping.

So I wrote him/her back to say that while I can ship to Jersey (though I'd need a zip code, which they hadn't sent me), I was not offering free shipping so they'd have to pay for it.  They wrote me back asking for an estimate and sent me their Jersey address.

I put the estimate together, but when I clicked on ""Send Invoice"" to confirm the buyer's address, the one listed is in California.  Now I'm a little at a loss as to what to do.  It seems fishy that they're asking for shipping to an address not reflected on their ebay profile, particularly when they first wanted free shipping on an auction it was never offered on.

Am I being paranoid here?  Is this a potential scam?  Should I only be willing to ship to the address on their ebay profile?  Should I speak to somebody at ebay about this, given that their help pages don't seem to address this issue?

Any suggestions would be hugely helpful to me.

Additionally, the item was a fully working laptop which currently has no OS installed.  The auction was set to OS Not Included.

I already contacted the seller, just wondering how this will play out. Does the sellers as is description override eBays definition of used?",7,4,2015-11-11,EBAY,0.03650907427072525,0.9365718364715576,0.026919031515717506
Ebay,"Buyer opens case a week after delivery, claims empty package","I sold an iPhone and it was delivered 4 November. Yesterday the buyer requested a refund/return, claiming that the package was empty and opened when it got to him.

I am looking for my receipt from usps when I dropped the package at the counter that would have the weight of the package on it.  

What is my best course of action at this point? I do not believe the buyer's story that usps told him it was empty when they received it. It was sent in a padded envelope, and the phone was wrapped in bubble wrap, meaning there was tension on the phone, even if the envelope somehow opened it wouldn't have just flown out.",28,4,2015-11-11,EBAY,0.027541745454072952,0.9077102541923523,0.06474795937538147

Ebay,How to cancel an offer that you've made?,"Just spent 20 minutes looking for this and I'm stuck.

A buyer sent me a message asking if I'd take a lower price for my item. I agreed and sent him an offer. Only thing is, I screwed up and forgot to remove the shipping fee from it. Ebay won't let me submit a second offer until the first one is canceled. According to [this page](http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/private_offer.html) I should be able to do this...

*""You can send a member only one offer at a time. If the offer expires or you cancel it, you can send another – up to a limit of 3 offers per listing.""*

...but I don't see how.

**EDIT:** For those who may need this, go to MY EBAY, ALL SELLING, find your item listing and click REVIEW ALL OFFERS. In the left side you'll see EMAIL OFFERS/OFFERS YOU'VE SENT. Click on the *offer*, not on the buyer's username or the buyer's feedback.

Ebay,Just sharing an experience re: eBay vs PayPal,"Wanted to share this experience I've had recently which I think highlights some important differences between eBay and PayPal now that they're split.

Started with a buyer in China (I'm in US) asking for cheaper shipping on a watch. He was told it wasn't available, but he bought the item anyway. Before paying, he again asked for cheaper shipping and was again refused. We opened an unpaid item case and to avoid his account getting hurt, he paid... and asked for cheaper shipping. Thrice he was denied.

I called eBay to ask how I should proceed. I specifically didn't want to have him leave us bad feedback because we wouldn't give him cheaper shipping, or simply file a ""not as described case"" and return it to us, forcing us to eat the shipping both ways. EBay said that due to the log of communication, there was no way they would side with him if a case was opened. I went ahead and asked the buyer if they wanted to cancel before we shipped but got no response so we shipped. He receives the item and again asks for money back on shipping. Again, we say no. So he asks to return the watch. We have a 14 day return policy so we say we'll accept the return, but he's responsible for all the shipping that way.

So what does he do?

Opens a ""not as described"" case on PayPal. After I upload a summary of the demands for cheaper shipping, PayPal still somehow rules in his favor, despite nowhere in our previous communication, or indeed, his initial claim a statement that the item isn't as described.

I call PayPal to appeal this and they tell me he LATER said the watch didn't keep time (once it was obvious he wasn't going to win the case unless he lied). This is something that we specifically say we do not guarantee as ""keeping time"" is subjective (all watches will eventually gain or lose a second). I tell them that this is the first I've heard of it and ALL of our prior communications NEVER mentioned a fault with the item. PayPal informs me that they don't have any access to those communications through eBay now that they're separate companies.

So now we're being forced to get the item back and eat the full amount of the shipping.

The lesson here? Watch out for buyers that open claims through PayPal. While a buyer may well not have any case on eBay since they can review all the messages, that thin layer of protection where a buyer may let slip their real intention and thereby lose a case, is gone on PayPal now, making it all the more easy for buyers to lie.",7,5,2015-11-12,EBAY,0.09043154120445251,0.8665775656700134,0.04299088940024376

Ebay,How to deal with the limited number of free listings,"So I've been selling on Ebay for over ten years now, and slowly have started selling more. But now I've come across the problem that the limit on items that you can list for free is starting to be annoying. As I understand it, each month you can offer something like 45-50 items for free, and after that you have to pay for them. Now my way around that is usually just to wait untill that has been reset and I can offer them for free again, but that seems rather silly. And I would think Ebay would make more profit if that weren't the case, since it seems likely that many other sellers are doing the same.

Now the only alternative I can think of is getting a Basic Store subscription, but I don't really sell that much to merrit that.

Are there any alternatives I am not considering? How do you guys get around that?

I've even considered opening up a second Ebay account, but then I would also divide my feedback score which I place a lot of value on.",5,2,2015-11-12,EBAY,0.024001015350222588,0.9067389369010925,0.06926005333662033
Ebay,Same Day Shipping Trickery,"So, I am still starting out on ebay and to give myself a boost I usually go for Same Day shipping if ordered before 12PM PST since the Post Office and mail box is right across the street amd buyers have shown that they like it. eBay however seems to not like it. I have ALWAYS bought postage the night before or day of, and always shipped same day. Sometimes I will get an order at 9PM which I obviously can't ship off. I will then get an email from eBay at 2am saying ""Did you remember to ship this off?"" not to mention that scanning updates slowwwwww on ebay. They will show the tracking uploaded or w/e value for a whole day...but if you go to USPS site it's allready 2 states away. So now it's taking a crap all over my effort to get Top Seller (Which isn't really much effort for me at my location).

Ebay,I think I'm getting scammed. I could use some solid help.,"I sold a brand new in box Droid Turbo on eBay on the 5th, and the seller messaged me today and claimed that the phone was broken and destroyed on arrival. I KNOW that there's a VERY slim possibility of this happening, as I put the phone in the hard box it was bought in, and padded it with padding paper. I used a Priority flat rate envelope.

Here's the message history:

(Buyer) 
I received a red Motorola turbo that I purchased from you on 11-5-15. Upon opening the paper envelope it was shipped in, the screen was cracked and the unit will not power on. I am thoroughly disappointed and would like my money refunded.

(Me)
I'm going to need a picture of the phone, and packaging, receive the phone back to me, and I will be confirming the IMEI number as well before I provide a refund. 

I've sold phones on here before, and people have stated that the phone was broken when It was actually a different phone. I packed the phone inside of its Verizon box, AND I packed it with packing paper as well. I have a HARD time believing the screen would have cracked.

(Seller)

Ebay,Help with possible feedback extortion please.,"I recently sold an item and the buyer is not happy with it. 

I suggested a partial refund (as a good will gesture) but they have asked me to refund 40% of the final sale price to replace one part and repair another, which I feel is too much. Neither of these issues were issues I was aware of prior to sending the item. I have said I am not willing to partially refund that much but I will offer a full refund if they return it. The buyer refuses to return the item as they live far away from the post office and it would leave them out of pocket to return it to me. 

All of this is pre-feedback and the buyer said they want me to rectify the situation before they leave feedback, which I feel is indirect feedback extortion.

Essentially the situation is that they want a 40% refund full stop, which I don't believe I'm obligated to give. I have spoken to eBay and they have suggested I continue to try to resolve the situation amicably and suggest a full refund on return, which I have. I genuinely don't want the buyer to feel I have misled them or tried to misrepresent what I was selling, and I didn't think I had! 

As no feedback has been left and the buyer refuses to return it is there anything I can actually do at this point? Can you report feedback extortion when it is indirect and the feedback has not been left? Is this feedback extortion?

I made an ebay 2 weeks ago and I was looking for some gamecube cables earlier today but didn't find one I needed.

I logged into my ebay now and it gives me an unpaid item notification telling me I need to pay?? What the hell? I didn't order anything and I don't see where I can cancel this.

Ebay,Global shipping nightmare,"I sold some old analog radios through GSP on eBay. I misidentified the radios according to the buyer. When I rechecked I realized that the Kenwood TK-480 &amp; TK-380 radios are identical except they run different frequencies. Assuming my buyer is not lying it my fault totally. Me and the buyer have been negotiating him keeping the radios for a partial refund but today he told me he would need a $175 refund to be even on the radios because his radio 'expert"" was only going to pay him $25 a radio. The radios are worth about the same as the 480 which is around $85-$100 a piece. So i thought that was ridiculous but whatever I would rather pay to have them shipped back rather than give him $175 partial to loose my radios also. So I have no idea how to get this guy a shipping label  none of the normal options are in the return request. 

I have been having a lot of savy international buyers abusing the global shipping on me. It's a really crappy system.

Ebay,PSA: Be really careful with your wording when dealing with buyer issues,"I run our store with my SO.  He used to help quite a bit, but our other business (flipping houses) has been really busy lately so I've been running eBay by myself for about five months, plus I hang out here and on /r/flipping a fair amount for educational purposes.  Anyway...

Since I usually handle all of the customer service functions with bigger decision approval from him, I didn't think twice when he said he followed our usual procedure when a buyer complained about an item being defective - requesting a photo.  Buyer sent photo, item is not defective (was manufactured with the ""issue"" she was having - actually buyers remorse), advised buyer that return will not be accepted because not defective/damaged.  Buyer opens return case anyway, and of course, I call eBay this morning to point out her and my pictures showing that the case is as manufactured.  The rep right out told me she agreed it was buyers remorse and we would have won that case, WOULD HAVE, except...

Bless my SO, he mis-spoke (typed?) when he requested the photo and, instead of saying they would be reviewed, said that the return process would be initiated once they were received.  He meant to say we would review the photos and decide if the return process would be initiated, but...yeah.  eBay is hyper-literal with these things, and while I knew that, he didn't realize what a word game it could be.

Oh well, at least the cases aren't defective - assuming the buyer doesn't do something stupid to them to lose her refund rights (like return them super used), I can just sell them at my flea market booth next year.",3,10,2015-11-18,EBAY,0.13966430723667145,0.834092378616333,0.026243295520544052

Ebay,How to deal with buyer threats?,"I sold an antivirus program, new in box, on ebay.  I have it set up so that I don't offer returns.  On the listing it says ""Returns: Seller does not offer returns. You are covered by the eBay Money Back Guarantee if you received an item that is not as described in the listing.""

I got a return request wherein the buyer said the reason was ""Doesn't match description or photos"" and in the comments wrote he was ""mislead because he thought he was getting a CD"".  I guess he had trouble following the instructions that came in the box to download &amp; use the product key code in the box, because he then states he called the antivirus maker and they charged him $100 for support.  He says if he doesn't get a refund by tomorrow he will leave negative feedback.

Nowhere in the category, title, or description did it say it came with a CD.  It was totally new in box the exact same way the stores sell it.

This is what the official ebay email says:

&gt; Be sure to resolve the buyer's request by Nov 23, 2015. After that date, the buyer could ask us to open a case, and this can affect your seller performance level.

&gt; Note that if you accept a return, you'll be charged for return shipping because the buyer mentioned that something's wrong with the item.

&gt; The funds for this transaction will be unavailable until this return has been closed. You can also use these funds to issue a refund. You must issue a refund within 6 business days of the item being delivered.

&gt; You can ask us to step in and help if there's a problem with the buyer's request.

So, what should I do?  I don't think I should have to pay for this guy's idiocy and threats.  Furthermore, if I had it returned, he has ostensibly installed it with help of support (though I can't be sure of this), so it's worthless to me.  I wouldn't even have a way of verifying the key hasn't been used yet.

My main goals here are both to not refund the purchase and also to avoid any negative feedback/defects.    Should I immediately ask ebay to step in?  Should I not reply and let it get escalated?

I'm a powerseller on ebay with a shop, I sell alot of £0.99 items with fast and free shipping as a loss leader to entice custom.

Even when resolved the default remains. 

If I could automaticly message all buyers via eBay messenger stating what to do in the event of an item not arriving on time, and a follow up message 3 days after a sale to ensure item has arrived, I belive I could reduce the amount of these defaults I recieve.

I just recently won a pair of shoes via ebay. The seller had a fixed 8 dollars shipping cost via Standard Shipping on the listing; however, the tracking states it was mailed via Media Mail.

Ebay,(UPDATE) How to deal with buyer threats?,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/3tcup1/how_to_deal_with_buyer_threats/

Per my replies yesterday I did contact them over the phone and they said that on Saturday I could contact them to get it escalated and closed in my favor.  One thing I forgot to mention is that the person I talked to suggested I communicate with the buyer, let him know that he was not misled, etc.  They advised me not to mention the feedback extortion thing or that I would escalate it and definitely have it found in my favor. 

Before I could even reply he gave negative feedback, so now I wonder if I should even reply.  If he withdraws the return request does that close the case and prevent me from being able to get the negative feedback removed?

EDIT: Just to update on Saturday with a data point in case someone finds this through a search.  I did not communicate with the buyer but he closed the case on his own on Saturday before I could call.  This freaked me out and I called up and was sent to the feedback department.

Ebay,"Sold an phone listed as faulty but the buyer has sent a refund request and locked me out of paypal, who will win the case?","Hi, Sorry if this question has been posted before!

Basically I sold a phone on eBay that was listed as faulty/spares or repairs as I dropped the device and the screen got a hairline crack and started having visual problems.

I put the item on eBay for a low price as I didn't want to fix it myself, it sold fairly quickly to someone with 100% feedback. Only after I left positive feedback for the buyer (about a week after he had received it) he put in a request saying he wants a refund because the screen doesn't work, this of course as locked me out of my paypal account when I need to withdraw funds from it.

I never stated in my listing that the screen didn't work or that it was working, I had put that I dropped the phone and the screen is cracked and is having visual glitches and was advisable to get it replaced.

I sent him a message saying that I wouldn't accept a refund as I sold it as faulty and stated that the screen was cracked and was having visual problems. he's not replied even after two messages and eBay is going to step in on the 27th.

I'm just wondering who is in favour here? Will he win because I didn't clearly state that in the description even though it was listed/for parts or will I win because it was listed as that?

Hello everyone,

So last week I bought two items from Target on eBay, the total that I paid for it was $254.xx because of tax (free shipping).  The tracking says that it was delivered yesterday, but I was home all day and did not get any USPS boxes delivered.  I tried the USPS customer phone number but was only given the automated option telling me that regular customer service was not available.  I submitted an e-mail form telling them that it was not delivered.


Since I bought two different items, but paid in one PayPal transaction, does the required signature confirmation apply since it was over $250?

I am really stressing at the thought of losing that much money because the tracking says it was delivered even though it wasn't.  But I'm holding on to hope that the lack of signature confirmation could save me.

So I wait a little to see if there are any higher offers and in this time he changes his mind and asks to withdraw the offer because he can't afford it and can I reject it. I say that I'll wait a day and if I get another offer I'll take it. If not I'll make a counteroffer and we'll take it from there. He says thanks.

10 minutes later someone buys it. No offer or questions/contact - just a straight away purchase and immediate payment. This person has an account a few months old and only 1 feedback.

Ebay,Question about Ebay's new Dashboard and shipping delays...,"Buyer bought an item, asked me to deliver to a different address because she's moving.  I said I can only deliver to that verified address.  She said OK, that she'll tell the post office to forward her mail.  Turns out it takes a few days for that to happen.  Package arrives to her old address, she's obviously not there.  I send her a really nice message offering many solutions, and reassuring her that it's not lost and neither is her money.  She speaks with the post office, and they forward the package to her a week and a half later.  She leaves an extremely positive feedback saying I am an awesome seller.  Turns out Ebay dinged me for that late delivery.  Under the new dashboard, it says I have 1 out of 27 late deliveries for the month.  WTF.  I am just following protocol.  Can I get this removed?   

Which brings me to my second question.  I use to deliver to Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Canadian Territories.  There's even a note on my posting that say I do, and to just be patient as some of these remote places only have planes going once every week or two weeks!

Ebay,[Question] First Negative Feedback,"Awhile back I sold a police radar detector on Ebay. These are illegal in my state so I didn't extensively test it. I listed this in the description and may have even had the title marked as ""as is"". I did check that it powered on. Anyway this guy messages me and wants a return because it ""doesn't work"". I didn't want to pay the return shipping on what turned out to be about $10 profit so I just refunded him the full amount. In the meantime he left negative feedback. When I saw this I sent him the revision request. We messaged back and forth 3 times because he DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO IT. Finally I gave up and called Ebay. They just informed me they cannot remove the feedback even though they reviewed the messages and saw the refund. So I guess my questions are: 1) Is it really true that even if you refund someone you can get stuck with negative feedback? And 2) Should I try to call Ebay again and try a different representative?

Ebay,The Tea Cup Auction Apesh!t Buyers Incident,"My wife picked a tea cup and saucer at an estate sale recently so we listed it for sale in an auction format to end on Thanksgiving Weekend Sunday night.

Ebay,Getting scammed over and over,"I've been arbitraging Microsoft subscriptions (Xbox Live, Office, etc) on eBay and in the past week I've had 3 disputes on PayPal for unauthorized transactions.

Ebay,This selling thing is more difficult than I though - Views from a new seller.,"So I wanted to try my hand at selling items on eBay. I have a random hodge-podge of things I wanted to get rid of, as well as 'overbought' a few items in a niche that are hard to find or are overpriced in Canada.

Man selling things is complicated. I've got a great reputation as a buyer, (and perfect as a seller of 7 items thus far). But I think Im finding the cards are stacked against me as a new seller. On my main item I want to sell I have a better price, am the only one offering free shipping, have a very optimized easy to find title with keywords, lots of high-res images and a full description.

I have 11 views across 2 listings that have been up for 3 days in a decently active category. Is there any way to rank higher regionally? I'm only shipping from Canada, aiming to ship to Canada (Open to USA as well). Is it worth sticking it out unti lI have 100 sales and get that coveted 'top seller' badge. Does it help that much? Is it worth taking a hit on prices early on to get the top-seller rating or am I over thinking it?

Ebay,turns out sometimes ebay screws the buyer too...,"I'm primarily an ebay seller but I also buy quite a bit on there as well. Here is the story of a recent clusterf*** I've been through with one of those transactions.

I buy an electronic device intended to interface with my vehicle. It's sold by a seller in china. Come to find out the item does not actually work with my US spec car as they had stated. I inform the seller of this oversight, ask via ebay messaging questions to return it and they agree to accept the return via the same format (not an actual return request via ebay buyer protection yet). They ask me to send it back to them, to an address in NY, on my own dime. I ask for a return label and they do not respond.

I file a formal return request via ebay's resolution center process by stating that the item is not as described. I get an automated email from ebay telling me that the seller has accepted my return, and that I should ship the item back to the seller's address (in China, different address from the first one they gave me manually via ebay messaging). 

At the same time ebay sends me another automated email stating ""the seller cannot provide you a shipping label"". IT says that even so, the seller is responsible for return shipping and should either provide the return shipping costs or a label, and that I should contact the seller again. The seller continues to respond in broken english that I should return the item for a refund, and that is all.

I call ebay CS to discuss the issue. The rep says the seller is allowed X number of days to provide the label before ebay CS will intervene, so we must wait until then.

I wait, and call back again. Another ebay rep ""puts the case on hold"" while communicating to the seller that they must provide me with a return label or return shipping costs. 

The seller sends me a manual paypal payment for $35...an arbitrary amount that I have no idea how they arrived at...which is supposed to be for return shipping cost. They again state that I should return the item to the NY address they gave me in the first message.

This seems fishy to me so I call BACK to ebay CS and ask another rep whether it is okay for me to return the item to the NY address as the seller requested, vs the China address shown on the official ebay return case page. The rep says that, yes, it is okay to return to NY, because they have a record in ebay messages of the seller asking me to ship it there instead of China. The rep tells me to send the seller a message with the tracking number after I ship it out to NY, which will serve as a record for the ebay CS reps, and that once it is received by the seller, ebay will refund me. 

I ship the item to NY, send the seller a message with the tracking, and wait. Item gets delivered to NY quickly. I tell the seller I've returned it and await my refund. A few days go by with no refund or response from the seller.

I call BACK to ebay CS again to inquire what the holdup is. The rep tells me that the seller is allowed 5 days after receiving the returned item to give me the actual refund...and since it has only been 4 days, we must wait an extra day. Then if the seller still has not given me the refund voluntarily, the CS reps will do it on their end. I am advised to call back the next day.

A couple hours later I get an automated email from ebay stating that the case was decided against me and that they would not be giving me a refund. WTF?

So I call right BACK to ebay CS and get a different rep. I explain the whole debacle to him and he doesnt understand it either. Then he comes back and says, ""well I see the problem. Some other CS rep overlooked the fact that the seller requested you to return ship it to a different address than their ebay registered address, and when the tracking showed delivery to that different location, you lost the case. I will go in and appeal it and award the refund to you right now. Give me a few minutes to arrange this, then expect the refund."" So I get off the phone and wait. 

A few minutes later I get a call from the ebay rep telling me that due to some technicality, he can't make the refund go through right now, and his shift is almost over. So he is making a note to handle it first thing the next day when he comes in, and he will call me to update me then.

Overnight, the seller sends me a message saying they have refunded my paypal payment. The next morning I have a voicemail from the ebay CS rep calling me back to tell me that he ""saw a message from the seller saying they've refunded me already, so he won't be processing the refund after all."" I check my paypal account and I have no refund (and no manually send payment) from the seller for the amount in question (or anything close).

So I call BACK to ebay CS yet again, and this time I get a foreign CS rep. I explain the whole issue to him. He tells me that because I returned the item to the non-ebay-registered address for the seller, ebay does not cover the return at all and I am on my own for recovering the refund from the seller. I reiterate twice that an EBAY CS REP TOLD ME TO SHIP IT THERE and he simply says that the rep(s) in question gave me incorrect information and that is now how the system works, so he cannot help me. Eventually he offers to go back and submit the case for investigation, he claims they will pull the recordings from the other calls and check for evidence of the reps telling me to ship to the NY address instead of China. HE says he is not guaranteeing any result or refund for me, but he will contact me within 48 hours via ebay messaging to confirm the result of the investigation. 

For shits and giggles I went back in my phone and found the Utah phone number that the rep called from (twice). I called it back and got an automated message telling me that the number doesnt accept incoming calls and that any inquiries should be submitted via the ebay customer service link/phone number found on the website. So that was a dead end too.

Update: OF course habib who was supposed to ""investigate"" the recordings of the prior calls to ebay CS reps re: the address discrepancy never contacted me ""personally after 24-48 hours with the results of the investigation"".

So I waited until this afternoon to call ebay CS hoping to get a US rep, which I did.

I first tried u/elislider 's recommendation to just ""play dumb"" and say that I haven't received a refund I was promised. The rep put me on hold for a second and came right back to pretty much call me out and tell me that the reason the refund was not awarded was because of the previously discussed return address discrepancy.

Then I had to go through the whole spiel about all the different conversations with ebay reps etc. and how the seller requested a return to the NY address, and that when I called ebay to question it, an ebay CS rep signed off on it and assured me it was okay, but now they are trying to go back on that agreement.

He went back in my messages and found the request from the seller (twice) to ship to NY, agreed that it was fully acceptable that I shipped it there, and processed a manual refund right then.

It showed up in my paypal account as a payment from ebay, not a refund from the chinese seller.

Oh, and nothing was said about the $35 payment sent by the seller for return shipping to NY, which actually only cost me $15. I plan to keep that as a little tip to offset my hours of time wasted trying to deal with this issue....hopefully the seller doesn't try to dispute it with paypal or something.

I'm just glad to have it all done at this point.",18,11,2015-11-27,EBAY,0.08475647680461407,0.8886525332927704,0.026590973138809204

Ebay,Seller didn't disclose electronic came from a smoker.,"So I bought a motherboard that I have been looking for the past month or so.  Received it yesterday and the first thing that hit me was the smell of smoke before I even opened the box.  It only got worse when I opened up the package and looked at the motherboard.  There's remnants of tar and discoloration due to it coming from a smoking environment.

Seeing as how there will be PC fans blowing air over it and it will be in my room, I cannot keep it.  

I feel that since this was never disclosed that this was a huge misrepresentation of the product, it also said that it would come with cables, it did not.

Ebay,I just received the most bizarre message,"I found a ""signed"" copy of a Hunger Games blu-ray, I sent the buyer asking if I could please see a picture of the autograph because the listing just had a Hunger Games blu-ray stock photo.

Thank you for your inquiry about Mockingjay. I would send you a pic of my autograph, but I don't typically send the items out until they are paid for.

Ebay,I've been scammed by a buyer. I'm screwed aren't I?,"Long story short, I sold an iPhone to a buyer in Ukraine. The tracking number still says it's in transit, but I was told by USPS that packages stop tracking once it leaves the States.

Buyer claims a month later that the package never came and won the dispute. When I disputed the ruling, I was told because the tracking number says he never received it, that they have to go on that. I've tried contacting the buyer to no avail. How convenient.",14,5,2015-11-28,EBAY,0.05092446878552437,0.8830769658088684,0.06599853187799454
Ebay,Title/Keyword Changes?,"In the past you could omit certain terms from an item's title if the item was in a category that included that word. Simply being in the category would cause the item to come up in searches.

For example, selling a Lion King plush: if selling in the Disney category (and Lion King sub-category) and the toys category (and stuffed animals sub-category)

Disney, the Lion King, stuffed animal, toy

All those tags became optional/redundant for inclusion in the title, allowing you to make a more clear and coherent title that hits all the relevant terms.

If low on space, I would sometimes leave out a term like ""Disney"" since it was in the Disney category and came up in searches.

Apparently this has changed - many of my items don't come up in the logical search for the item anymore. :( I have a lot of title editing to do now...

Anybody know when this change occurred? I'm pretty sure it was in the past few months while I wasn't listing too much, I only noticed it these past few weeks.",1,3,2015-11-28,EBAY,0.05945086106657982,0.9113999605178833,0.02914918214082718

Ebay,eBay phone support refuses to help.,"First the setup. A few months ago someone broke into my shop, damaged and stole inventory and equipment. They got on computers and messed with accounts, such as my businesses ebay account.
They canceled the store, removed all my listings and canceled all the transactions that were paid for and waiting to go out. This all cost my small business money through direct payments to ebay and from diminished sales due to my account going from Top Rated to Below Average.


Yet another reason why ebay is going to fail. Its been going down hill for awhile (from my seller perspective) but the biggest problem here is ebay refuses to reverse the cancellations. I can prove that this occurred as there are two separate police case numbers. 

According to ebay, they only accept fraud claims if it occurred from another IP. They won't even talk to the detectives or take down the case number.

I've spent the last several weeks on the phone with ebay reps and they refuse to do anything about it. I was passed around from department to department.

I then was sent to the fraud department where they gave me a link to give to the detective in charge of my case. I shared the link with the detective and he spent some time trying to get it to work. He even signed up for an account, because it claimed he needed one. Then it turned out the link we were given was for the police to request information from ebay. That wasn't what the ebay rep stated it would be.

So I called back again and was given another link. This time the link was for the detective to upload the case file. The problem is, its an ongoing investigation, so he can't simply upload it. Ebay would need to go through proper request department channels. The detective finally said he can talk to someone if given a number but can't keep spending time with these links as he has over 20 active cases.

I called back to ebay again and they refused to help any further, simply stating that if the malicious activity occurred from my computer they can't help me due to their strict policies, even though there was a break in and the computer was stolen.


So now what? Does my business continue to suffer? I have a 100% rating, yet I am at below standard because of this break in. I had a year subscription that was canceled and I was charged for the difference in price, even though I restarted the subscription as soon as I could. All the charges for listings are just gone, even though I didn't take down the listings or cancel the subscriptions.

Is there anything I can do, anyone I can speak with, or am I just screwed ??

Ebay,700 Transactions with 400 Feedback in a year. Will they ever do something about that?,"I've been on eBay for 13 years now. I know feedback is a complete coinflip. I just don't understand why?

If a buyer never says anything about a purchase it should just be a positive feedback after however many months. Especially if negatives affect you.

All these years eBay gives you a feedback rating with negatives affecting my percentage but no one knows about 300 other transactions that went just fine.

Now come February it won't hurt you at all which is more of a buyer concern since feedback ratings are essentially a lie (even now with DSR)",20,7,2015-11-29,EBAY,0.10000326484441757,0.8473944067955017,0.05260235443711281
Ebay,Worried about a potential scam,"Hey, so I sold a pair of shoes which are high value (£450). The buyer's account is 3 days old and has no reputation - they say they made the account so they can buy the shoes. They paid, but what I'm worried about is the buyer potentially claiming that the shoes are fake.

What's to stop the buyer from replacing the shoes they receive with a fake pair, making a claim with eBay, then sending me the fake pair when asked to return them?

I've taken detailed pictures of the shoes and the box. Is it too far to record the whole process of shipping them? (ie from packaging them to receiving the receipt)

Should I just cancel?

Occasionally I'll get an item or two that is over 2 pounds and the size of the medium flat rate box/ regional rate box A.

Ebay,"My ebay story, I still can't believe this","About year or two ago I had eBay account that I was using for buying. And one day I was reading something about drop shipping and wanted to try it.

I ignored that ban and from that day I was just avoiding eBay. Aliexpress was my shopping store and all that. 

But now I got in new business that I really want to sell on eBay. I didn't even remember about my last eBay account I just created new one Bussiness account. I published 4 product everything was fine for 2 days. Third day I got email that my account was restricted and that I need to call eBay to validate my account. That is just what I did. I called them and hour ago. Now here is a most interesting part. Guy on phone told me that my account got restricted because I had another eBay account that has been restricted. That was the moment when I remembered that I had that one account that was banned for no reason. When I remembered that I asked him why was my first account banned. And he told me this: **For security of our customers I can tell you why you account was banned. All you need to know is that you account was high risk.** I was like what the hell, I am not something like terrorist xD I wasn't selling bombs or anything like that. What should I do now? I really want to start selling products on eBay. I will call them tomorrow and try to convince them to get restrictions on my account. What do you think I should do?

Ebay,Buyer scammed me through the Global Shipping Program :(,"I sold a PS4 bundle a month ago to a Russian buyer, and I shipped it through the GSP. I never had a problem with the GSP, so I decided it was safe. When he received it, he claimed the bundle only had the console, and did not include a controller, game, or hard drive, and wanted to return it for a full refund. I said no, since the the bundle was never opened, and my shipment through UPS marked it as 10.20lbs, which is the weight of the entire bundle (it would be lighter if it was missing the hard drive, controller, and game).

He escalates the issue with eBay, so I call them. Here is what eBay told me over 3 phone calls.

Phone call 1 (on the day of the refund request): Sorry but I can't help you now, please try to resolve it with the buyer. You will have to wait 5 days if you want to escalate.

Phone call 2 (5 days later, when the buyer escalates. eBay says I have to offer a return): Sorry, you have to accept a return. If you want to escalate it, you can after you have received the item back, and you can say you did not receive it in the same condition.

Phone call 3 (same day as call 2): You must pay for return shipping from Russia, which is $120, because it is your fault that you did not send him the entire bundle, so eBay does not have to cover the Global Shipping cost.

Today, eBay gave him a full refund from my PayPal account automatically because they decided in his favor after a final review...
