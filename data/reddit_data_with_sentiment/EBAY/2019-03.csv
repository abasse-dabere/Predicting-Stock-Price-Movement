Ebay,Ebay really needs to do something about non-paying buyers,"Now days, I rely heavily on BINs anyway, but if I'm not sure what an item is worth, I like to use an auction. But then guess what, I always get that 0 feedback user who bids on it and never pays. I seriously can't remember the last time a 0 user ever paid. Ebay should require new accounts to confirm a payment method when they put in a bid that gets charged immediately after they win an auction. It's so stupid that they get a week to pay, and then when you submit the unpaid item dispute, they get almost a whole other week. So now I have to wait almost two weeks just to get a chance to list the item again, and then have to go through another week for the auction to end again. So basically, when someone doesn't pay, I basically lose almost an entire month. 

They have no problem holding new seller's money when they sell something. They shouldn't have a problem holding a new buyer's money when they start bidding willy nilly on every auction they see.",34,105,2019-03-01,EBAY,0.20700596272945404,0.7709552645683289,0.022038737311959267

Ebay,Monthly sales reports with shipping and fees,"What happened to the ""reports"" link in seller tools?

There used to be a link called ""reports"" in that section.  Anyone know where they moved it to?  Used to be able to download a CSV with sales, shipping (pulled in from the API), and fees from that area. 

File Exchange doesn't actually show the shipping cost if you use a 3rd party to ship like the reports link did.

Ebay,"eBay App (iOS) automatically changes listing price to ""Trending Price"" - ridiculous","This has been happening as of about a week ago. We create our draft listing on a computer, no problems. Save the draft. Take pictures with phone, and go to upload pictures using the eBay iOS app. 

As soon as we start to edit the draft listing in the iOS app, the listing price automatically changes to the ""trending price"" right before our eyes.  If you don't notice it happening and saved the listing, you'd lose your original set price altogether.

This past weekend we had about 10 listings all submit (live listings, READY TO BE PURCHASED) at prices we did NOT set (all prices were about half of what we'd originally set). We had to immediately remove all active listings, research comps and set prices all over again (original prices were overwritten, no way to know what they were before). 

If a seller weren't 100% paying attention, this could lead to significant losses in sales.

Anyone else experiencing this? The eBay app is only getting worse. First it was automatically enabling the GSP, then automatically enabling Best Offer, now this? I sure do hope this is a bug.

Ebay,Buyer wants refund on nonrefundable item after almost 2 months,"Hello all,

I sold a used router (tested before selling and worked) for $12 with free shipping and the listing ended on January 13th. I shipped it the next day and he received it on January 18th.

Fast forward to today, March 3rd, I received a message from the buyer that he's having issues with setting up the Wi-Fi with his Internet provider. He asked me for a refund through the message. My listing states that I don't offer returns. I apologized to him that he was having issues and told him that he could send it back to me but he would need to pay for his shipping label. I would give him a refund after receiving the product. I also mentioned to him that it has been *almost* 2 months since the listing ended.

He messaged back asking why he needs to pay for his own shipping label and that he worked with his Internet Provider for over an hour to fix the issue he was having with the router (unable to connect to Wi-Fi).

Ebay,Person buys factory new XBOX and now threatens me with legal actions over the smallest possible thing.,"Have  sold an XBOX one last week, factory new and only the first flap has  been opened... so basically unopened. This buyer, apparently a  collector, contacts me a few days afterwards that he's angry because the  small round transparent sticker on the top of boxes is missing. Demands  I cut the price for him because of that. I deny him that, telling him  that even with that, 130€ is an okay price.

After  a day of back and forth, he straight up tells me he'd take legal  actions I don't do what he says. I've had enough at that point and just  tell him he should return it. This was on a friday, got no answer from  that and expected the package to arrive until now.

BUT:  Today he contacts me, telling me he opened the box up and unpacked the  XBOX to take a look at it. He did find out that it was completly unused,  figure. Still demands a price cut because, since there is a missing  sticker, it doesn't fit into his collection. I deny him again, telling  him again that he should just return it.

I  already spoke with Ebays support and they told that I'm basically  covered here. He threw more allegations at me how wrong my auction was  when I put the product on ""new"" with the sticker missing. I kept  informing him that he had two simple options: Keep it or send it back.

But  not simple enough for him, since he now threatens me again with  contacting a lawyer... because ""We are tired of having disadvantages  because of your mistake"".

Waiting on his answer now, where I again tell him to just send it back.

Now here to just ask what you would do and/or advise me to do.

Thank you all!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit01: He didn't mail back yesterday but I just got a Mail where he declines the offer of return and refund after consultation with his lawyer. Goes over the ""new"" stuff and how wrong it is and, hold on to your seats, claims that he found out via microsoft that the console was already registered. While it could have basically anyone that did that, since I foolishly(or rather unknowingly of such system) posted the serial number in a picture on ebay. BUT a quick chat with the microsoft support confirmed my suspicion that he's just pulling this stuff out of his arse.

Further he wants me to either switch the console for a brand new one or compensate him for damage (25€). Talks about that he as the injured party has to deal with a lawyer since I don't have any interest in fairness ... yes, I don't have any interest in fairness after offering him full refunds for 3 days, even after he has unpacked the product completly!

After some recommendations from you guys, I reported him yesterday already. But I guess the Ebay Support will have an easy one there after I just attached the screenshot from the chat with microsoft support telling the exact opposite of him. I'm curious if he's now just gonna quickly register the xbox, take to the support chat and post it with them saying it is registered.

Ebay,Opened a store &amp; my sales went way down. Coincidence?,"I finally decided to make the commitment and open a store on my eBay account.  I've had stores in the past on other accounts but this particular one wasn't high volume enough to warrant it.  Over the past 6 months I've been doing pretty well with $200-300 in sales a week selling 1-3 items a day on average.  So I bit the bullet and open a store and literally the day I opened it I had zero sales.  And zero the next day.  And the next.  I opened the store a month ago and I've had an average of $100 in sales a week in that time.

I did take into account the time of year and post-holiday slump but my sales were nearly identical in December and January.  And I sell cosmetics, skin care and hair care items - not exactly gifts.  And over the past several years the only sale dips I have are during the summer.  Is this a coincidence?

Ebay,Question about return and refund,"This is a first for me so I need some help. Sorry for the length, it's a little complicated.

I sold a shirt back in February. The buyer submitted it for a return claiming ""Doesn't match description or photos"". The claim is for a stain that I am 99.999% confident wasn't there. I am extremely anal about disclosing damage, and this being a white shirt any damage would have been noticeable to me. That said, I'm human and mistakes can happen.

My first curiosity was that eBay automatically accepted the return and my screen showed that they ""have asked the buyer to return the shirt by February 26"" and that I should wait to receive it before issuing the refund.

I thought that ""items not described"" cases would obligate me to pay for return shipping, but there was no place I saw to provide this to the buyer.

I called eBay to ask how to do it, but before I got to the question, eBay informed me that the buyer has lost protection due to a history of fraudulent returns.  (Looking at their left feedback, this is true.) I was instructed just to wait and allow the process to play out. If I received the shirt back, I could choose whether to refund or not.

February 26th came and went. The buyer hasn't returned the shirt, hasn't provided tracking, hasn't communicated with me. On March 1st I called eBay to ask if they could close the case. The guy I spoke to had no idea what I was talking about. He seemed very confused, but by the end of the conversation I thought that he had figured it out and said he would close the return.

It's now March 5 and the return is still active in my account.

I'm not really sure what to do now. Should I keep calling eBay? Just keep waiting?

In the future, if I ever receive a legitimate item not as described return, how do I provide a shipping label? Create one and message them a picture? I figured eBay would handle this automatically but that doesn't appear to be the case. Why else would the buyer have not returned yet? Are they blocked from receiving a paid shipping label because they lost buyer protection?

Any insight here would be very helpful.

Thanks.

Edit:   

I just got off the phone with them again. Finally got an English speaking agent. She reaffirmed that I was in the right with this case and that the reason they can't close it manually is because to do so would be an ""escalation"" which is something they can't do because the buyer has no protection. She told me that the system should automatically close it after 30 days. She also told me that if the buyer leaves me a negative that they would remove it for me.

So it looks like I'm good now, I just have to wait.

2. I've also had someone purchase an item then message me for my paypal so they can pay. I've told him/her pay though ebay and if they won't ill report them for scamming.

Ebay,Blocked buyer making a purchase from a guest account,"About a year ago a buyer purchased an item from me and never paid. This buyer had no feedback or transactions on eBay and opened the account just to make this purchase.

Reported and blocked at the suggestion of eBay. Relisted the item.

I immediately cross reference my orders and sure enough its the same person name and address but different user name. When i called eBay they told me since his original account had no infractions that this was totally fine to sign in under a guest with no repercussions even though he was blocked.  eBay stood by this and let this person leave negative feedback on my account claiming ""that was their experience"".

After several calls i finally got them to remove the feedback and somewhat understand the problem, but the bigger issue was they told me this is totally fine on the buyers end as long as they didn't have negative infractions on their original account.

Ebay,"eBay buyer opened up a case, and then received a chargeback from his bank without seeing the case through...","Buyer contacted me demanding a refund suggesting that the item I sent was damaged. Is being all around nasty… calling me things like “moron” and “genius”. 

I have picture evidence that proves the item was sent out as described and in new condition (It is a tablet, and they sent me a picture with dead pixels that were NOT there when I shipped it— which makes me believe that he damaged it and wants a refund).

Later, he went on to complain about the sound quality of the tablet. In short, it’s a $50 tablet. This leads me to believe this is just a matter of buyer’s remorse.


I’ve already contacted eBay’s customer service department and documented this. They told me they don’t see anything wrong with the item and said they side with me. However, the buyer reached out today and said that he already received a refund from his bank in the form of a chargeback, and now I see my money on hold in PayPal….

Ebay,Do I HAVE to open a case on eBay for a seller to refund me?,"So, I bought a video game on eBay near the end of last month.  It requires a specific accessory—a guitar cable that connects a real electric guitar to the console.  Most of the time, the cable is significantly more expensive than the game.  I bought from the listing I chose because the title and description both clearly stated, “cable included.”

Fast forward a few days, and my package arrived in the mail.  It’s just the game; no cable.  I’m annoyed, but I email the seller and explain the situation.  They apologize and say they’ll give me my money back... I just have to go into my purchase history in My eBay and open a dispute, saying I want a refund because the item was not as described.  That’s a bit of an inconvenience, and I’ve sold on eBay before and am pretty sure that the customer doesn’t *have* to do that.  In fact, the seller should probably want to take care of the situation without making a claim via eBay, so they don’t have a dispute on record.

I open the claim, and eBay auto-generates a return shipping label.  Well, I don’t have a printer and honestly don’t think I should have to go out of my way to return this item.  I tell the seller as much in an eBay message.

They respond two days later, telling me I don’t have to send the item back, but I do have to open the dispute with eBay.  I reply, saying I’m pretty sure I don’t have to do that, but I already did it two days ago.  I ask for confirmation that the refund is in progress since it didn’t sound like they were aware that I’d already opened the dispute.  I also apologize for sounding so frustrated, but I’ve worked in customer service for over 20 years and in this kind of situation the only response I would ever have given would be to apologize profusely and refund the entire purchase price immediately.  Making sure the customer didn’t have to lift a finger to be made whole.

Well, they just sent me another message saying that it would be far easier if they could resolve it themselves, but this is eBay’s policy and the refund is progressing entirely at eBay’s pace.  I think this is a lie, because as far as eBay is concerned they’re waiting for me to ship the item back.  The seller has told me that I don’t have to do that.

So who’s correct here?  Am I at the mercy of eBay, or is the seller trying to make things difficult for me?

Edit:  I don’t actually want the game; I already own it.  I only bought it for the cable.  It’s just the principle that I shouldn’t have to go out of my way and spend more money to get a refund when the seller was entirely at fault here.  Also the game is nearly worthless without the cable, so I don’t know why they’d even want it back.

Edit 2:  Called eBay, and they agreed that the seller was lying to me.  Their theory is in line with the responses here; that the seller is trying to convince me not to send the item back so that eBay will simply close the dispute.  They're going to investigate the seller to see if this is a pattern for this seller.  I will still have to send the item back, since the seller is clearly not willing to refund me without a return like they said.

For those who think I'm acting entitled, please keep in mind that at no point did the seller ask me to return the item.  When I brought it up, they specifically said that I didn't have to send it back; and that was after I had already opened the claim and started the return timer.  I didn't call eBay to complain until they tried to say that it's eBay's policy not to allow a seller to issue a refund without eBay's intervention.  This is a bald-faced lie, and a seller with over 300,000 feedback knows that full well.  It was a lie.  Sellers, don't lie to your customers.",31,3,2019-03-06,EBAY,0.061577945947647095,0.9049659371376038,0.033456090837717056

Ebay,Can't change address - country not on list,"I've just moved to a different (albeit small) country - The Faroe Islands.  
Ebay seems a bit confused, and I can't select it when trying to update my address.  
Now the Faroe Islands are a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, but a separate country, just like Greenland which IS available as an option.  
I can't set my new phone number for 2FA, since the country code is not on the list.  
Ebay customer service is not geared for problems like this, and I've been ""assisted"" in trying to ""update my address"" a few times now by ebay staff who think I'm doing something wrong on the form. After an hour of hold time and a few different agents, they've promised to ""look into it"", but I'm pretty sure they've just brushed me off.  

One agent even tried to get me to convince sellers to send to an alternate address (and lose all seller protection).  

The issue here is that the country (in a commonwealth-like situation) is NOT part of the EU or the EU customs union like Denmark is. 
The address format is different, the shipping costs are higher and the phone country-code/internet TLD are different. Adressing a package/letter to ""Denmark"" with an address in the Faroe Islands will sometimes work, but usually not, because of the different shipping costs and customs and is simply not an option for reliable shipping - most packages will just be returned to sender.

For example, suppose you have an old video game, still in box. Like new, from decades ago. Depending on what it is, value has definitely gone up, right? ""Oh cool, I have one, but don't really want it! So let's sell!"" And so you look at sold listings to find out what it's going for.

So you'll see this same game, having been sold 10 times at $100 each time. So I list it at $90. No sale. I continue to see the same item sell for $100. I lower my price to $85. Nope, nothing. I SEE IT SELL 3 MORE TIMES at that $100. So now I've got it down to $80 and still can't move the damn thing. 

So I have to wonder.. Why does it seem as if buyers are willing to pay another seller more money for the same item, even with similar feedback percentages and total sales and so on?

I have a theory, but I could be totally wrong. I think that many of these buyers will list their items, buy it themselves with another of their accounts, and attempt to inflate the value of the items they have. By doing this, they artificially raise the market value of items. Am I totally off on what they're doing? Was there any hope of me ever getting that $100 for this hypothetical item?

I hope someone can school me on what's going on. And if there probably isn't a conspiracy happening here, what are some weird, basic things I could do to hopefully move any item faster?

Ebay,Negative feedback retribution?,"A few weeks ago, I purchased an item. Seller waited over a week to ship (handling time said 1 business day), then when the item showed up it was not complete.

Today the ONE item I was selling auction style sold to him. He hasn't paid yet, but I'm wondering what my options here are.

Ebay,Big time sellers getting away with selling replicas,"So basically I had an old armani t shirt i had bought a few years ago from turkey (its not original, I bought it for like $20) that i had barely worn so I thought about maybe selling it on ebay.

I decided to put up a listing and an hour later it was taken down because it was an unauthorized item. So my question is why does my listing get taken down meanwhile all the other big sellers get to keep their listings up for months and sell hundreds of t shirts??

Ebay,Anyone seeing QTY 1 items relisted after you sell them?,"Forgive me if this has been posted, but I experienced this 3 times today.

One item was QTY 1, sold today, and then reappeared as active with 3 watchers.  I ended it immediately to be safe so that it didn't sell again and then get dinged by eBay for cancelling.

Second item (and third) were multi-quantity in stock, but the quantity didn't lower after the sales (i.e. QTY 4, stayed at 4, even though I only now have 3 left).

Am I crazy?  I called eBay and got an off-shore rep this late at night, and he said that I ""had listed the item as good til cancelled, so it immediately relisted it"".  Well, NO, I did not, and also, why would they relist it if it's gone?

I speculated that their new policy to make everything ""Good til cancelled"" was screwing up and they need the developers to look into it before they aggravate a whole lot of buyers and screw over an equal number of sellers that can suddenly not fulfill orders.

Ebay,"Buyer has a dozen questions about condition, keeps asking if it's mint","I'm selling a Super Nintendo in its original box, and have described the product as in good shape, the console still being in plastic, and the box showing signs of age like fraying at the edges etc. I include detailed photos of all damage to the box, and each part of the console. 

Buyer messages me, asks if it's mint. I know better than to say something's mint because I'm not trying to get an INAD case on a $200 item, so I tell him that to me it looks to be in great shape, but he should check the pictures to make sure it's up to his standards before buying. 

Guy repeatedly asks just about every question in every phrasing about condition despite the fact I keep telling him that it's up to him to look at the photos to assess if it lives up to his standards, as ""mint"" means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Wants to pay $150, tell him no, now $160, another question about if it's mint, same answer, now $170.

So I basically just decided not to sell to him because I'm genuinely not comfortable selling something like this to someone so hung up on condition who is obviously not comprehending what I'm trying to tell him about the condition of the item.

Ebay,eBay gave my smartphone away for free,"so I listed my used Moto G5 Plus on eBay in the past weeks and sold it to a buyer who resides in Canada.

Ebay,Dealing with an ugly return request. Am I being unreasonable?,"I bought a vintage 80s boombox that was listed as used and the description mentions that the tape player does not work, but otherwise functional (radio and aux input).  When I received it, the sound was cutting in and out along with peaks in the music when using the radio and the volume at less than half.  I also tried the aux input and the same thing was happening.  I felt that this was a separate issue than the one regarding the tape deck and after deciding that it would be unusable to me, I asked for a return.  The seller claimed that I abused it and ""blew"" the amp, stating that I put too high of a signal in the aux input, which he say was only designed to take a phono level signal.  Also claims that CDs weren't even invented when this was new (irrelevant and incorrect), assuming he saying that a line level signal will blow something in the circuitry.  He says that the listing was sold ""as-is"" and that he will not approve a return.  I sent him videos of the issue and tried to be as friendly as possible, but his hostility turned our communication into an ugly battle of him blaming me for abusing the radio and me letting him know that he's wrong about that.  I'm pretty experienced with electronics, have 20 years as a professional audio tech, and am an electronic musician.  I have a lot of boomboxes and everything he says makes no sense.  I have to wait a few days to get eBay involved and I'm curious what reddit thinks about my position on this.  I was happy to try and fix the tape player, but even if I do that the radio amp seems to have issues that I'm not sure I can fix.  I even sent him videos of the same model being played with an external source at high volume with no issues, yet he still blames me for the problem.  Just looking for a sanity check here...

Ebay,"Buyer buys five Nintendo Wiis, eBay charges shipping for only one, tells me it's my fault","Wooo universe is testing my patience this week.

Had a listing for Nintendo Wii Consoles, set to buy it now, with a quantity of five available. Set default shipping to USPS flat rate box, assuming that when someone buys a Wii, they'll get charged the $14.35 per item for shipping.

Last night, a guy orders all five Wiis, eBay charges him $14.35 for shipping - for ALL five. On the phone with eBay now, and they're telling me despite the fact the quantity purchased goes up, if you use calculated shipping, the system will assume the same shipping cost no matter the quantity. 

So if I have bricks listed, and the calculated shipping to mail one brick is two dollars, but someone orders a thousand bricks, it's still going to charge him two dollars shipping regardless of the quantity. 

Asked where the setting is changed to avoid this in the future, and the rep needs to put me on hold for like 5 minutes to get an answer and figure it out because it's not immediately clear just from the listing set up page.

Ebay,Confused about sales tax as a business,"Hi All, 

Starting an eBay business. I understand the tax basics and have been keeping a detailed spreadsheet log on each sale but it just dawned on me.. what about sales tax? I haven't been collecting sales tax on my sales in my state (CA). It's not very clear what i'm supposed to be doing here. 

Should I be collecting sales tax for CA residents? But how do you actually pay the collected sales tax to the state?

FYI i'm operating as a sole prop at the moment if that matters but I do use an eBay &amp; Paypal business account. 

Thank you!",3,7,2019-03-12,EBAY,0.03173566237092018,0.9318303465843201,0.03643398731946945

Ebay,"Reshipper, international buyer, lots of negative feedback","I don't know if I'm being paranoid or not but here's what happened.  I sell cosmetics, I do not ship internationally due to past nightmares with tracking so I have all international countries blocked.

A buyer purchased 6 of the same item from me.  The buyer is in another country, has had an account for 10+ years and has left 20+ negative feedbacks (all of which are over a year old).  I googled the address given by eBay and it appears to be a reshipper.  Normally I would ship and not question it as I have before when someone uses a reshipper BUT the negative feedback and multiple items of a higher ticket item are making me nervous.  But then, if I chose to cancel the transaction they can leave me negative feedback still, correct?

Ebay,"EBay Seller Item Always Shows ""Last One!"", Even After It Sells","A competitor has an item up that ALWAYS shows ""Last One!"", and has maintained their purchase history (120 sold). 

The listing is supposed to be deleted after one is purchased. How are they able to game the system and continue to show ""Last One"" at all times? 

This sense of urgency and sales history REALLY helps them, because their item is priced $80 more than everyone else's, but most of the rest of us are providing much more with the product, with a better feedback history. I am still selling well, but if I increased my price to something closer to his, it would take weeks to sell one, if ever.

Ebay,Customer requesting a return. Question for more experienced sellers before I respond.,"So I have had an ebay account for a long time (since 1999, I think), but I really don't sell very often. A few weeks back, after doing a deep house-clean, I decided to sell a few items I didn't need anymore. One was an electronic item, a Sony GV-D1000 MiniDV player. It's an older item (anyone in video knows that MiniDVs aren't used much generally anymore). I'm pretty sure Sony doesn't make them anymore. It was listed as used, and I posted several photos showing the condition. I did test it out and made sure it was in working condition before I listed it. 

It received a decent amount of bidding, and sold for a price I was perfectly satisfied with. I packed it up nice and securely (I even included a FireWire cable that wasn't listed or shown in the pictures) and sent it off to the winner. 

Yesterday, I got a return request from them, saying that the lid latch on the item didn't lock. Now, like I said, I did test the item out and made sure it worked before I sent it out, but I can't swear that I tested if the lid locked. So they could very well be telling the truth there, I don't know. But here's the thing... whether the lid locks or not, shouldn't affect the usability of the item. The item is used to playback/record MiniDVs, and it does that. I'd consider ""the lid not locking"" to be a minor cosmetic issue that should fall into the matter of it being listed as used. 

So I guess I'm looking for advice. Should I just suck it up and take the return? Or dispute the return with the argument that the item retains its intended functionality?  

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!

The item does have interest (14 watchers, which is actually very good since this is more of a niche item without a huge amount of page views), and 5 low-ball offers.

Does this just happen sometimes to anyone? I haven't noticed any new competitors that have been selling at a better price/value. I've also even lowered the price and am offering free shipping so I can just sell the damn thing and stop this worry. 

Thank you for any advice or feedback",13,5,2019-03-16,EBAY,0.03278415650129318,0.8242403268814087,0.14297546446323395

Ebay,Buyer Claims They Did Not Authorize Purchase of Item (Already Delivered A Month Ago),"I sold an item on February 17th, and tracking says it was delivered February 23rd. A buyer opened a case today stating they did not authorize the purchase.

I'm worried that if Paypal finds the case in the buyer's favor (which they obviously will since they always do), I will not get my item back and they will take the money from my account.

Is there some sort of seller protection that can prevent the buyer from keeping the item and getting a refund from my funds?

**UPDATE: I called Paypal yesterday, and they said that since the tracking confirmed the delivery, the seller protection is active so the funds should be returned (as many of you told me).** 

**However, the buyer went through his financial institution for this case, so Paypal needs to deal with them first. I'm assuming he had his bank account linked to Paypal as a backup funding source, and used his bank this way.**

Ebay,Am I right to be suspicious of this item and its seller?,"Hi there, 

Long story short, I am in desperate need of an e-ink monitor. Essentially only one company in China sells them, named Dasung. They're expensive, they take long time to ship, especially to UK, and they sell out quick (they won't be on sale for another month, probably won't get hands on one until at least May). 

Recently I noticed an auction on Ebay for a 2019 Dasung Paperlike 3, they have sold out officially now. It's unused and unopened. The pictures look legit. 

Here is the strange part. I noticed that the seller, from Belgium, purchased the product from the Dasung Indiegogo website (he left comments inquiring when the product will be shipped stating ""i'm desperate, my eyes are dying!"". He purchased it on 1 January, he said it took 2 months to arrive and he has immediately put it on sale on Ebay. I have sent two messages asking for a reason for the sale, no response. Auction ends Wednesday. 

Am I right to be suspicious of this? 

Should I just go ahead and bid on the item knowing I have the Ebay's money back guarantee? 

Thanks for reading and any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. 

BTW, for those wondering how I know that the ebay seller is the same person as the indiegogo buyer, it's obvious from the fact that the items location on Ebay is Belgium, the indiegogo buyer signed off his comments ""greetings from Belgium"", and unless it's a coincidence, his name on Ebay is the first two letters of each of his three barreled name on indiegogo. Add to that the niche item on discussion and it's pretty obvious they're the same person. Also the time from shipment from on indiegogo to the time of sale on Ebay match. 

**Edit:** I also feel it's worth mentioning that the seller has not responded to any of my questions about the item: reason for sale, and initially I queried why he hasn't shown the device without its wrapping. But I guess he wants to keep it as a completely unopened item.",11,2,2019-03-17,EBAY,0.061915669590234756,0.9099048972129822,0.028179379180073738

Ebay,Potential buyer obviously didn't read listing-would you block?,"US seller here. I am selling a Japanese import copy of a video game. The title and description both very clearly state that it is a Japanese import, however I received a message from a potential buyer (also in the US) asking me: ""Is it Japanese?""  

&amp;#x200B;

Without going into too much detail, it would be completely obvious to anybody looking at the listing that it is a Japanese game, and the only way you could ask that question is if you literally didn't read the title or description or were trolling (which I seriously doubt in this case).  

&amp;#x200B;

Since it is not a US region game it does not play natively on US region consoles and requires a modded or Japanese console to play. Since the buyer clearly didn't even read the listing I don't trust that they understand this and I am concerned that I have a potential INAD case in my future if this person actually ends up buying it.  

&amp;#x200B;

It isn't a very expensive game and all things considered I am not desperate to make the sale, but I am curious, would you potentially block this buyer? Is there a point at which you simply don't trust a buyer to use the item correctly and figure the risk of them forcing a return for a dumb reason is greater than what you would gain by selling to them?

Ebay,eBay is telling me conflicting things regarding a return case. Seller is ignoring all emails from both eBay and I.,"Hi all, I’ll try keep this short.
So, about a month ago I bought a vintage Burberry umbrella off eBay.
It arrived, and straight away I knew I’d need to return it. The item was wrapped in a plastic bag. That’s it. No box, just a bag. It was comical, you could still clearly see the outline of an umbrella.
Sure enough I get home and it’s broken. The metal parts have snapped and torn the canvas of the umbrella.
So I take the appropriate pictures and email the seller. He basically tells me to get lost, so I start a case. 
I win the case and receive the shipping label, however as it’s an umbrella is it too big and the post office tell me I need a label for a bigger item. 
I call eBay and explain. They tell me as it’s too big the seller needs to arrange collection of the item, and if he chooses to ignore them, the case will be decided in my favour. Cool, case put on hold while we wait for a reply.
Sure enough there is no reply from the seller, so I call eBay to check what’s happening. They tell me due to the buyer ignoring them I can keep the item and receive my refund. I say great and the call ends.
Not 5 minutes later I’ve received an email saying I have lost the case and will not receive a refund. I’m really confused and so call them back. Different guy answers, says a few things I don’t really understand and tells me to call back tomorrow.

Anyone have any idea what I can do? I have provided pictures of the broken item, the seller hasn’t replied to anything in weeks and I just want my damn money back.

Ebay,neg feedback on a cancelled order,"Here's a doozy.  So I had this camera listed and got a best offer on it.  It was 30% lower then my asking so I asked him to meet me in the middle on the counter-offer.   He did then sent me a message saying that he wanted to pick it up locally and inspect it before paying.  Alarm bells went off knowing that he would then make up some kind of excuse to low ball me and say that he was paying cash etc..

So I cancelled the order due to issue with buyers address.

30 minutes later, the item is magically paid for with shipping even though the order was cancelled.  So I called ebay to ask wtf and they said to refund his cash through paypal.  I did that and moved on.

30 minutes later, I get negative feedback from the buyer calling me unreliable.  I have about 2000 feedback and 0 negative.

Another quick call to ebay and that negative feedback was removed - at least they said that it would be removed in 24-48 hours.  We'll have to see I guess.

Ebay,Another INAD Case - what should I do as a seller?,"So I know this subject/issue has been beaten to death, but I'm not sure what exactly to do in this situation. Subbed in the two brand names, but they are drastically different price points (and independent of each other).

&amp;#x200B;

1. On March 3rd, sold a brand X roller ball pen, genuine purchased from Amazon by myself previously for about 1/2 the price of what I paid from Amazon (ended up not giving as a gift). Included extra genuine ink. Pen was unopened, unused. Paid about $140, sold for about $70. Shipped USPS Priority.
2. On March 16th, buyer opened a INAD case, ""Doesn't match description or photos"" with text ""This item is not a authentic (brand Y) pen. It’s a cheap imitation , unlike what was posted in the description. I would like a refund.""

3). I responded within 24 hours twice, first saying ""Not once was it said to be a (brand Y) pen - it is a genuine (brand X) purchased from an authorized dealer,"" and then realizing he doesn't even have the brand right, followed up with, ""Nothing in the description even mentions what you claim.""

4) Radio silence since that last message. Feedback left on my account with the following: "" Cheap counterfeit (brand Y) pen. Don’t purchase!"" (and of course was private auction, so no one can look at what the action was actually for).

5) Not sure how to proceed since my only options are to offer a full/partial discount, accept the return, or send the buyer a message.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I called eBay Customer Support and explained the situation. They stated that I needed to wait and eBay would eventually step in, but after reading many horror stories (and being very annoyed that I've given other buyers even more of a discount than the pen itself cost just to keep my 100% rating), I have a feeling eBay will just send him the label and charge me for it, and I'll end up with an abused pen or an empty box (or an actual brand Y fake pen).

&amp;#x200B;

Besides the options listed in #5, the only other thing information I see in the eBay case is: ""\*\*There's something wrong with the item your buyer's received, so they'd like to return it.\*\*Please take action by Mar 21.Your PayPal funds from this purchase will be unavailable while this request is open."" Will deal with the feedback after; since it is simply a false statement, do you think I can get this removed?

&amp;#x200B;

How should I proceed? Going back in time, I guess I should have just taken the return, but I was afraid of it being damaged or missing (since I originally sold it as new)... plus wanted to defend that the item I sold is indeed genuine and of the correct brand.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't post too often, so hopefully I'm going about it properly. Thanks in advance!

TL;DR - Buyer bought a brand new authentic pen that was advertised (with many photos), filed a INAD case saying it was supposed to be a different brand AND is fake - afraid to trust eBay's rep saying that if I wait until after the response window they will step in and close it. Also worried an eBay rep is not going to understand that the feedback is completely not valid...

Ebay,Buyer messaged me for item not received. What next?,"I've seen several versions of this question asked, but they usually have qualifiers. If someone could help me out with the next steps, I'd appreciate some info.

I shipped a shirt to a buyer and the tracking shows it was delivered this morning.  The buyer messaged me saying they didn't receive it as the tracking shows.  They say they contacted their post office to open a case and asked that I do the same which I'm in the process of doing.  I have to wait 45 minutes for a postal agent to call me back. 

It was shipped first class, so I don't believe there is any insurance.  

I don't think I'm responsible for refunding the buyer if it comes to that, but if I don't, do I risk a negative review? Should they open an item not received case with ebay as well?  

Basically I'm looking for the best practice of what steps to take next that will end hopefully with a happy buyer and no dings on my account or money out of pocket.

Ebay,"Got sold a fake on Ebay - Shipping is 3 months from now, what can I do? Seller admits to it.","Long story short, I was looking for a MiniPro (self-balancing board) on Ebay with the 15% off coupon.

I found one for a decent price ~400ish USD which is a good price for a MiniPro and not outlandish. So I figured since the seller has 97+% rating, it should be good... so I bought it.

However, after scrolling down I noticed that the picture of the device was different from the top one(It was unlabeled). So I contacted the seller and they told me it was fake blatantly and it was already sent out.

It was clear from the title that a fake wasn't the intended product and I'm pretty sure you can't sell fakes on Ebay.

I called Ebay and I told them the seller told me it was fake. However they said I should file a return request when it arrives. But since the delivery is up to 3 months from now, am I just screwed until then? Even if the seller told me it was fake to begin with and they knew?

Ebay,The forced Good til Canceled listings isn't the only thing that changed. Watch out!!!,"I've always used GTC anyway, so that part didn't affect me.

Here's the real kicker though. I started noticing that even when a single listing sold, it remained in my ""active"" listings. Concerned that it would automatically relist even with zero inventory, I called ebay to ask about it. The (barely speaking english) lady that I talked to, assured me that the items with zero inventory would not renew. 

I looked at my account activity this evening to double check. Not only did the zero inventory items get relisted, I was charged an insertion fee for them as well!

So, as it turns out, it looks like every time we sell a single item, we have to go into our listings and end the item as well. For people that sell a lot of single items, this is going to be a real time consumer and pain in the ass.

Suddenly today I get an email from PayPal telling me I've been refunded because the account I sent the money to is not associated with PayPal or has not completed the setup process. So now I have my money back. But I obviously can't send it to the same PayPal again. I'm not sure what's going on.

I was going to contact the seller but if Ebay has something in place and they are still getting paid I dont want to have to pay them twice. Morally, they should get paid once. However if they're not getting any money at all now, I'd like to make sure they do.

Ebay,Negative feedback I received was warranted? (Long story),"I have an eBay account that I use here and there to buy random items and to sell anything I think might be valuable since lately I have been cleaning out my storage boxes. Every item I have sold has been a smooth transaction ending with satisfied buyers and positive feedback for both parties.

The most recent item I sold over a month ago I ended up receiving negative feedback. I sold an item that is rare and that cannot be easily replaced or purchased new in stores, it is less than $100 value though so it's not some super expensive item.

Listed the item with clear pictures and description as well as fast 3 day shipping guaranteed. The item sold, the buyer paid quickly, I gave the buyer positive feedback, and I shipped out the item same day. I also added the tracking number to the eBay transaction right away so the buyer knows when to expect the item.

I was checking the tracking all morning to make sure it got delivered fine. Then I see at like 1pm the FedEx tracking says it was delivered to the front porch of the buyer. I was relieved it was delivered and at that point I was waiting and hoping for a positive feedback.

Four hours later is when this whole thing goes sour fast. I get a message from the buyer saying that he checked the tracking and it says delivered but he just got home from work and didn't see a package from FedEx and that he wants me to contact FedEx about the missing delivery.

I asked him to first look around his house to look for it and that FedEx marked it as delivered to porch. I also tell him that since the tracking has it marked as delivered and that he's disputing the delivery he needs to contact FedEx first so he can give them a description of his residence and so FedEx can asked the local driver about it.

I sent him a picture of the package with the FedEx label that has his address so he can know how it looks like. At this point the buyer gets very angry and insinuates that I may be scamming him and that he wants a picture of the package at his house (wtf).

I continue to tell him to just look around his place and to contact FedEx. I assured him that if it was stolen or the item didn't show up that I will refund him and that I will file a claim with FedEx.  I also told him that if he wants to wait until the next day that I can get him the direct number for the local FedEx warehouse for him since I work for FedEx but I wasn't at work that day. I even explained how the claims process and such works.  But I always let him know that I will make sure he gets the item or a refund. Now then he is still very angry and says he doesn't trust me and such and that he doesn't want me to scam him.

After another hour I get a message and picture from the buyer saying he found the package and that FedEx delivered it on his side porch next to a puddle of water. The buyer tells me he glad I packed the item very well or else it would have been damaged  He says he always gets his packages on his front door and that he was going to file a complaint with his local FedEx driver. I tell him I'm glad he finally found the package. 

Finally then hours later I notice he left me a negative feedback. It says that the item looks to be ok and that he doesn't trust me or recommend me as a seller. Every one is entitled to their opinion but that feedback tanked my 100% rating to a below 70% one and I feel it was pretty unfair. 

What does everyone recommend I do? Just let it go or dispute that feedback? This honestly kind of soured me on using eBay again since so many things out of my control bit me in the ass.

Ebay,"strange buyer behavior, wtf","This is just an entertaining story, not really looking for help or advice.

I sell used car parts and occasionally higher value rebuilt car engines, fixed price, in my ebay store. 

The engines are too big and heavy to ship usps/ups/fedex, and must go truck freight. I have a flat rate truck freight shipping cost  set up on the engine listings. I also have the option for buyers to select local pickup with zero cost.

Recently, a buyer hit buy it now on one of the engine listings. When the payment comes through it is not immediately apparent which option the buyer selected (the ebay ""your item sold"" message does not explicitly state such), but if there is no shipping cost included in the payment, you have to assume the buyer selected local pickup during checkout. It appears this is what happened, as I received payment for the engine cost alone.

Within a couple of hours of the sale, I sent an ebay message thanking them for purchase, giving them methods to contact me, and confirming that there was no shipping cost included in their payment so I assume it was their intention to pick up locally (then give my location). I also state that if the buyer selected this option by mistake or in an attempt to get free shipping, then arrangements have to be made for additional shipping costs to be paid, or they can arrange and pay for pickup/shipping from their end, or we can cancel the transaction.

A couple days go by with no reply. I send another duplicate ebay message. I also go find their paypal payment and harvest their email address from that, and send them a duplicate message via email.

A couple more days, no response, I send duplicate messages via ebay and email again.

A couple more days, no response. I send the duplicate messages again, adding that this will be the final attempt before I cancel the transaction.

Bear in mind that this entire time there is $2900 that the buyer has paid that is in limbo, and you would expect that the buyer might be nervous or want to resolve the situation. I can't transfer it out into my bank account, I have to leave it sitting in paypal (which I don't fully trust) in case I have to refund/cancel. But no, the buyer does not respond in any way.

After over a week, I finally canceled the transaction today, and blocked the buyer.

Why would someone behave so bizarrely? Even if (as I suspect) they wanted to pay the engine price alone with free shipping cost, you would think they would have communicated with me in some way. Once they found out I was not going to give them free shipping they could have just asked to cancel so we could move on, but they didn't do any of that. For all they knew I could have just held onto their money indefinitely and forced them to interact before refunding them. You would think a buyer wouldn't want to have almost 3 grand tied up that way, and would care enough to respond in some way.

Oh well, time to move on I guess.",8,4,2019-03-25,EBAY,0.04604201018810272,0.9195970892906189,0.03436090797185898

Ebay,Buyer won bid then sent message saying he didn't want it.,"Hey All,


New to eBay and have ran into my first bad experience. An item I sold had several bids and bidders, and after it ended I was contacted by the winning bidder immediately after saying he didn't want it. Frustrating for sure, but wondering how to proceed. If I try to file a missing payment thing, it says I have to wait until a month from now. Wondering how I can just relist it since I know I won't receive payment. Does canceling the sale on my end reflect poorly on my profile? I'm assuming I can't contact other bidders right?

Thanks in advance.

Ebay,Account risk when listing modded game items?,"So, I've been thinning out my games collection for quiet a few months now. Been listing games and various consoles and really got rid of a lot of stuff that I either do not play, purchased just for collection sake or got as an extra while buying a lot.

And this is exactly where I have this problem now... A few years ago, I bought a Sega lot via my brother from his (back then) in-laws. I kinda knew what I bought and the price was dead on. But I did receive something I had no clue about what it was. When the second part of the lot arrived, I knew what it was; a copy-box. A device that allows you to play 3,5"" floppy disks with illegal games/rom files on it. I've tested it out back then, couldn't get it to work and just stored it away.

Now that I'm thinning out and have really never ever had an use for it, and that I really won't be offering any 3,5"" floppy disks, nor the 3,5"" floppy drive (it makes hideous noises so I guess it's busted anyway) the question rises: 

Will my 18 year old eBay account be at risk when I list this item? I cannot really figure out if it's against the eBay rules. Is it considered an illegal item? Is it considered a modded game/console? It's all there in the unclear. In the past few months (to a year) I've seen a couple pass by in the listings (both listed and sold listings) which doesn't really help me answering if it's ok to list an item like this or not...?

Ebay,"Received damaged item from eBay seller, he states I have to take it up with the courier?","Hi there



I am new to ebay so not sure how all this works. I ordered some cards recently and they arrived in a royal mail package apologising for the damage to the package. Upon opening the package, the tin that was used to hold the cards had been damaged and more than half the cards were bent. The cards were crammed in as such so i thought that this would be the reason for why the cards are bent / damaged. I spoke to the seller and told him about this and his reply was;



Really sorry to hear that in came such condition. The next step would be to claim for damage against Royal Mail. I will send you a copy of my proof of postage with all your details on.
You would need to refer to the Royal Mail website to make a claim. With this eBay transaction and proof of postage with tracking, that will be sufficient evidence for a suitable claim up to the entire value of the purchase.



However, upon reading a few forums, i have seen that all responsibility is with the seller and if damaged he would have to refund /  Partial refund me. I also read that he should be the one to apply for a compensation through royal mail and not me. So I went back to the seller and tried explaining this to him and his response was:



My understanding is that it has nothing to do with eBay, they aren't giving you the money back - It's solely Royal Mail. Therefore the 30 days thing you mentioned isn't relevant to this scenario, only the timescales that Royal Mail have for claims (which I believe are a lot longer).
Also, both sellers AND buyers have the same right to claim for damage and loss of items. Under my business terms and conditions, I state that the buyer must go through this process, not me.
I will aid in your claim wherever I can which includes giving proof of postage + tracking, but it is ultimately between you and the courier (In this instance - Royal Mail).

Ebay,"I was sold a stolen computer, need advice!","Not sure if this is the correct sub for me to post this in but I'll post it anyway...

Long story short, 10 months ago I purchased a desktop computer from Ebay from a third party seller. Today, for the first time ever, I received a pop-up on my computer from 'Company X' asking me to register the computer with Company X's IT department. The message also stated that if I am not an employee of Company X that I should call the number below. After calling the number and speaking with Company X's legal department I learned that the Ebay seller was an employee of Company X and he sold me his work computer that is owned by the company. Naturally Company X is demanding I return the computer or face legal action. Ebay and Paypal both won't help me since the transaction is more than 180 days old. What can I do to recover my money? I have the seller's email address (from the paypal transaction) and the return address that is on the box he shipped the computer in. What should I do?

Ebay,Ebay is trying to fully refund me for something that is not the sellers fault,"I recently bought a laptop from an individual seller who had been very helpful throughout the whole process. They even gave me detailed instructions on what settings would help keep the laptop efficient and powerful with third party softwares and such. They told me to keep an eye out for a package with their signature on the bottom right (Apparently to deter fraudulent INADs)

When I received my package, I received something completely different. And the package did not contain their signature on the bottom. It did require a signature...but the apartment manager signed for it without my say so and had it delivered to me. (I much rather go pick it up from the local post office myself)

I called up ebay and they suggested to open a case about the issue, which they did on their end. I contacted the seller about the issue and they have been doing everything on their end to rectify this, even calling up the postmaster to see if my package was misplaced or stolen. 

I want to say I believe them, and while I am getting a full refund for the case...the seller is losing a huge chunk of change from ebay. I don't think anyone should lose money due to an issue like this, but I don't know what else I can do to help.

Anyone have any ideas?

Ebay,My woes with Indian support - yes they can block you from receiving support,"So I contacted ebay chat support (unable to phone) regarding a purchase I made and want my money back.

These  people are in India apparently. The person I spoke to today was  offensive, aggressive to me, said things like  ""everyone knows that""  insulted me and was aggressive to me, pretended to connect me to a  ""manager"" but I had wait whilst they log in ""don't you realise the  manager needs to log in"" which was infact them logging in under a  different name.

This took over an hour  of insults and of I received no help just insults. They refused to  connect me to a support person in Ireland (this has happened before),  and refused to identify themselves with a call number.

He  let slip that he needed to contact his manager ""I was speaking to the  manager!""... and then I got disconnected when I pointed it out.

I'm incredibly frustrated over all the continued trouble I've had with ebay, and  deliberate time wasting and bad advice which has cost me additional time  and money from following it as well as all the distress from it.

Want to  know a ""funny"" joke they told - the person told me to disconnect and  reconnect to a new chat - strange I thought. After they disconnected me,  it turns out they appear to have blocked me from ""support"" as the  option does not appear in my buying account, but does in a selling  account of mine! That was a joke to them. I get the message ""  No eBay  representatives are currently available. Please try again later. "" in my  buying account.

This is harassment.

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE: Confirmed, they can block you** \- a manager of Indian support has just stated:

**me**: ""why would one account be able to contact chat support, and another not be able to?""

**them**: ""We won't be able to share exact details however it is based on user history and account specific.""

**me**: ""do you send information back to ebay which would prevent a person from accessing support?""

**them**: ""Yes we do send information if required.""

It turns out, Indian chat support report you to ebay who in turn block you. 

Further to this, once it got to the details with the manager, I found my buying account was suddenly unblocked. So, either the block is temporary or something they can control.",12,8,2019-03-29,EBAY,0.06298452615737915,0.908269464969635,0.028746027499437332

Ebay,"Seller sold me a fake item, managed to get both of us refunded...?","Ok so I purchased an item recently and it turned out to be a fake/knock-off/dupe, what have you. Yes, shame on me for not doing my homework. The nature of this item was such that I had to open the packaging in order to inspect the item and thus, be able to determine that it was indeed a fake (it was sealed in plastic and had a cardboard cover on the box that had to be removed as well). The cardboard cover on the box ripped when I went to remove it, and the box actually was dented in the corner when it arrived. I requested to return as the item was not as described and the seller approved my request. I sent back the box without the cardboard cover since it wouldn’t stay on and was ripped/useless anyway and I stuffed the shipping box with newspaper to keep the inside box from moving around.

The seller got the item back and immediately asked eBay to step in, claiming that I did not return the item in the same condition as it was sent to me. The seller claimed that I had dented the box (which I had not), failed to include the cardboard cover and plastic packaging (this is true, but I had to open the box to see the item??), and that there were “dirty handprints” on the box (I’m assuming some newspaper might’ve rubbed onto the box, I guess I’ll take responsibility for that).

I contact eBay and they said the seller needs to refund me but that they may not refund me the whole amount as I did not send back the item in the exact condition. In the end, I got an email today from eBay saying they went ahead and refunded both me and the buyer, even though I told eBay that this seller is listing fraudulent/fake items.

My question is — is this typical for this to happen? It’s mind blogging to me that I showed eBay proof that the company who makes the item that I *thought* I had purchased confirmed that it was a fake, yet they continue to let these sellers list items.",7,3,2019-03-29,EBAY,0.09386534988880157,0.8789699673652649,0.027164634317159653

Ebay,Need Help with Selling/Shipping CCG Singles,"So I'm a new seller on e-bay (just under a month now). I'm not a store or setting up to be a long time seller. I'm just dumping off my old card games, then getting back off e-bay. I've also literally only shipped 1 mayyybe 2 box sized packages in the entire 35 years of my existence. Basically, I'm the most noob user possible with basically 0 supplies and 0 knowledge. 

Of course, this is where everything horribly backfired. I started listing a handful of mostly Pokemon cards, about $1000 worth of 'em with singles ranging from $20-$150 each. Sending packages with UPS or FedEx seemed overkill for something so small and I didn't see any options for tracking an envelope (plus I don't have a printer, so I didn't use E-Bays shipping either). So I emulated what other sellers sending me cards in the past did. Bought a box of plain white envelopes, some paper to fold around the cards (""pro"" ebayers usually use the invoice to do this, but I'm not a store), some tape to double down on the envelope seal, and some home return address stickers. I also used sleeves and top loaders of course.

You can guess how this ends. A user who bought 2 separate high value listings totaling \~$300, (he originally was trying to get about $700 of em, but he backed down ... thank god) which I sent out on two separate days in two separate envelopes, put in claims against both listings as not received. All I did was take pictures of the envelopes right before sending in case the buyer wanted to see what I was sending but E-Bay is laughing in my face. I find it impossible that USPS can lose 2 separate pieces of mail ... but I'm not here to go any further into that ... this is about the future ...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, back to my original title topic. While his cases were pending last week I stopped by USPS to see what I could do for future listings. I watched a whole bunch of YouTube Videos and many were like ""don't do this ... buuuttt here's how you do this in a plain envelope"" but some recommended bubble envelopes. So at the USPS they had a bunch, and while they seemed a tad ... large, I figured fine I'll ask the clerk if this was how I should send these instead of the regular envelope with a card in it (I brought one as an example to show him what I was doing). He said no and that certified mail was the cheapest and best option at around $6 and some cents which seemed high to me. I know its nothing compared to NOT losing $300 but that seemed wrong enough to get me to ask here considering I see tons of listings on ebay and most charge $0-2 shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

Are people just eating the costs and not listing true shipping costs? Is there an option for envelopes I don't know about? What about cheap $5-10 cards ... is that where u go envelope and say ""screw it""?

Honestly it's probably way to late to be asking this as I've already lost 33% of the value of my cards, and theres about a dozen other envelopes already in transit still so I'm hoping not every user just pushes the ""yay, free refund on something I received button"" that I apparently handed them ... but I still have about $200 in value left in about 5 listings (which I JUST pulled down until I evaluate) that I'd like to do right.

Ebay,Action for item location misrepresentation policy update,"EDIT: Forgot to mention in the title, this is on the UK website, I don't know if they're enforcing it in the US too. 

&amp;#x200B;

[https://community.ebay.co.uk/t5/Announcements/IMPORTANT-ACTION-FOR-ITEM-LOCATION-MISREPRESENTATION-POLICY/ba-p/6260425](https://community.ebay.co.uk/t5/Announcements/IMPORTANT-ACTION-FOR-ITEM-LOCATION-MISREPRESENTATION-POLICY/ba-p/6260425)

&gt;Today we’re announcing new enforcement measures against listings and sellers who do not comply with our Item Location Misrepresentation policy. It’s important for sellers to accurately state the location of their items so that buyers can use eBay’s search filters to correctly select listings based on location. When this doesn’t happen, it creates an unfair marketplace for sellers and a disappointing experience for buyers.  
&gt;  
&gt;We’re grateful for the feedback we’ve received from our seller community about Item Location Misrepresentation.  
&gt;  
&gt;We’ve reviewed our policy and made some changes which should help prevent sellers from providing inaccurate information about the location of their items. They’re now required to select a postal option that matches the item’s location. From today (28 March 2019), sellers won’t be able to create new listings or revise listings where the item location and postal service don’t match.  
&gt;  
&gt;We’ll also be reviewing any international sellers who state their item location is in the UK, but have excessively high dispatch times resulting in extended estimated delivery dates. Our teams overseas continue to work directly with international sellers on policy education and enforcement to ensure compliance.  
&gt;  
&gt;eBay will continue to take further steps to enforce this policy, including removal of listings, restricting a seller’s trading activities and, in the case of repeated policy violations, account closure. We will keep this policy under review.  
&gt;

They buyer has already paid via Paypal and is attempting to arrange the pick-up. After reading some posts here, I'm afraid they'll claim I didn't deliver it and Pay Pal will issue a charge back. Do I have any options at this point to force them to use cash that won't also result in me receiving negative feedback?

They buyer does have around 50 positive feedback, and no negative in the last 12 months. However, their Paypal address is in another state. Just really nervous and feeling stupid for not setting up the auction better.

Any advice?",31,5,2019-03-31,EBAY,0.17116419970989227,0.7927298545837402,0.03610594943165779

Ebay,HELP! UK empty box scam - eBay backtracking and making me jump through impossible hoops,"So a few weeks ago I ordered a laptop on eBay. All seemed legit - once the item had shipped though I realised something was wrong. The seller sent me the postage receipt and I noticed the weight was 1/6 of what the laptop should be ...

Fast forward to it arriving, which I film myself opening, and it is two empty iPad boxes. 

Open a case as normal, not as described, and also email the seller.  Now this may be an important part - the seller replies and says he sent that by mistake, that was for someone else and he had got the parcels mixed up. He asked me to return them to him and he would refund me. At that point I asked him to issue a return label, and he went silent.

In the meantime I report it to the UK polices fraud division, action fraud, and get a reference number and case opened with them too. 

Fast forward to last week when I can escalate the case to eBay, I call them up and explain the messages asking me to return the boxes, and eBay issue me a returns label - brilliant. 

Next day I print the label out, and send the two ipad boxes back...and literally moments after, I get an email saying the case has been put on hold. As it was an empty box I now have to report it to my local police station, print out a form and get an officer to fill it out and put an official stamp on the document. 

I call eBay and challenge them, at this point I’ve already returned the item as they had asked, and point them to the messages from the seller asking me to return it. The supervisor I spoke to instructs me to continue with the returns process, not the police report, but that she will call me back on Monday after speaking to the “offline team”.

Next, just to be safe, I head down to my local police station to get them the info that eBay has asked for just in case. After waiting for ages to see someone I’m told that the police don’t handle matters like this, eBay shouldn’t be asking for me to do this and the place to report it is action fraud, which I’ve already reported it to. 

The thing is though, eBay ask for a police station official stamp on the form eBay asked me to print and take to the station, which is obviously impossible for me to get, if such a thing even exists. 

Has anyone got any experience with this sort of thing, can I just give them my action fraud reference details instead? Any advice?",3,4,2019-03-31,EBAY,0.11115800589323044,0.8654037117958069,0.0234383437782526
