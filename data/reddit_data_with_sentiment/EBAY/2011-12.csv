Ebay,"Am I getting scammed on Ebay? Buyer claims the USPS made them pay for the shipping, even though I paid?","So i've been selling on ebay quite some time. the other day I mailed a box filled with 4 professionally framed prints. I sold them for a total of $55 which was incredibly cheap.

I took the box to the post office, they weighed it, asked me how I wanted to mail it. I said Parcel and they quoted me around $22, which i paid in full. I also paid for a tracking number. from my past sales and past experiences, they should not charge someone in the same state to pick it up.

Today I receive this letter from the buyer:

I came home today to a notice that the USPS tried to deliver this to me, I need to go and pick it up because I owe $14.60. I already paid in full for the shipping of this to you, I just checked paypal and it shows this cost like $52+ total. I've been shopping on Ebay for way over 10 years and this has never happened to me before-that more postage was due. So, I'm emailing to find out what's going on. If I knew the $20 item would cost $52+ + $14.60 I certainly wouldn't have bought it. Charlotte

pretty much she claims she had to pay the post office $14 extra for shipping.

Is she lieing? why would the post office charge extra if they already quoted me a price, and I paid in full AT THE POST OFFICE?

I went ahead and messaged her asking her if she had a receipt, and I explained to her I had no idea why they charged her extra. I figure if she has proof that she had to pay extra, then It would have a transaction number or something I can question the post office with

She hasn't responded yet, but I figured i'd ask reddit and see if this is something the post office does in special circumstances, or if it's a scam?",12,4,2011-12-04,EBAY,0.04356064274907112,0.9242289662361145,0.03221035376191139

Ebay,"Buyer abused the dispute system to steal from me, do I have any chance of getting my money back?","I sold a set of used PS3 games on ebay.  I carefully inspected and packed them so that the most valuable games were in the center and I used bubble wrap as well.  The buyer reported that one of the games was broken (curiously one of the ones I packed in the center.)  My listing was marked no returns but I offered a partial refund in exchange for the broken game.  The buyer wanted to only send a picture of the broken game, but I said I needed the actual game returned.  He immediately opened a dispute which I escalated explaining the circumstances.  Literally within minutes of escalating the dispute was closed in his favor to give a full refund after returning the whole lot...sigh, what's the purpose of escalation if a machine still processes it?

Flash forward to today, I receive the return, but the two most valuable games have been swapped out with two cheap ones.  Also the broken has been snapped in half...I wonder how that happened?  So I'm already out about $50 including the ~~lost~~ stolen games and refunded shipping.  I reported the buyer but I have little faith in the system at this point.

One other thing: I took the poor online advice of leaving positive buyer's feedback in good faith so I can't even leave the guy negative feedback (as if it matters)

Side note:  I've had my ebay account since the 90s, but I don't use it much...my score is 18, so that gives you an idea how much I use it.  I've been scammed twice now.

**Followup edit:**

&gt; eBay Customer Support has granted your appeal and issued you a $30.00 credit to your PayPal account.

$30 is what I quoted the value of the stolen games in the appeal and a bit conservative, oh well.  Since I won the appeal I probably will also get the final value fee credited as well, but I can't say for sure.  So basically I only lost out on shipping, which is fair.  I'm pleasantly surprised!  I'm not sure what, if anything, will happen to the buyer.  It's in ebay's interest to keep him buying, c'est la vie.",13,9,2011-12-20,EBAY,0.05642307922244072,0.9087012410163879,0.03487572818994522

Ebay,"Buyer ""left town"" and now is a pain in the ass, now customer support is involved, opinions?","So the company I work for sells off our discontinued inventory on ebay.  We have been doing this for a few years and it has worked out pretty well.  Recently a back and forth began with a customer over an item.

The item is an old collectible item we sold him for $34.95 ""free shipping"".

The item was sold as is with absolutely no returns, the listing explicitly says that there are no returns offered. But we take returns anyway when people ask, we just reduce the refund by shipping costs.

The buyer bought and paid for the item through paypal and we correctly shipped it (at $12.86 our cost) to the address given.

Sometime in transit the customer called said that the address he provided was wrong, and asked us to change it.  We had him send the $12.00 address correction fee we get charged by the shipper and we placed the correction.  The package was redirected to the new address.  (same city different address.)

UPS made three delivery attempts at the new address and he was not there so they returned the item, billing us an additional $12.86 for the return.

The customer then contacting us saying he left town, and expected that UPS would automatically hold the package for 10 days, which is not UPS procedure. And was shocked that it had been returned.  He decided that he did not want to pay to have it reshipped and just wanted a refund.  This is where it gets tricky.

We decided since we had made no mistake on our part, even making the address change requested, that we would treat it as a return.  We had already spent on shipping and returning the item $25.72 not including labor.  We let him know that we would be reducing his refund by the $12.86 we paid to ship the item.

The customer of course lost it and demanded a full refund of the $34.95.  After a back and forth we issued the refund of $22.09 and felt that was a fair solution.

He of course opened an ebay case.  I explained our side and escalated it because I knew we could not work it out.

Ebay closed the case and sided with us saying that since he provided the wrong address to begin with we were not liable for the shipping...

&gt;eBay Customer Support comments:
The buyer didn't provide a valid shipping address when they bought the item. You don't need to do anything else. This won't be counted when we evaluate seller performance. Note: It may take up to 24 hours to update in your Seller Dashboard.

&gt;Final decision:
This case has been decided in your favor.

&gt;Thank you for the 3 years of membership on eBay and the efforts you make to satisfy your customers. We appreciate your time and refund of $22.09 you gave your customer for the ---------------------- that was returned to you as undeliverable. We understand how frustrating it can be for a transaction to not go according to plans. We understand you refunded your buyer according to the item price minus the shipping costs. However, you customer is not yet satisfied and your listing states free shipping. For this purpose we are emailing you today in hopes you can help us make this right. If the customer feels he/she purchased this ------ for $35.76 with free shipping, the refund should be for the $35.76. Looking at it from the customers point of view, and in hopes to satisfy your customer, please reconsider your refund to him/her and take action from there.

&gt;Thanks again for helping us keep eBay a safe place for buyers and a great place for sellers.

I have no idea where the $35.76 number is coming from since the original price was $34.95.  But, regardless They already resolved this through the resolution center.  I wrote back and mentioned that this had already gone through the resolution center and now I am waiting.

I figured I would write here and see if any sellers had anything similar happen and how it turned out, and also to get opinions, are we being unreasonable here?
