Ebay,Scammed...help is appreciated!,"Recently I sold some Xbox Live Microsoft Points cards on ebay. I sent the code to the buyer and he then put up a dispute saying the transaction was made by accident. He used the code already.

Ebay,"Just checked with FedEx International, $1,137 to ship my package.","Ok so I'm selling a medical device sort of like a giant microscope.  It's worth $900-$1750 used and a person just bid $925 on it.  I'm selling it for my father and we were both psyched! The guy had 44 100% ratings, most of which came from used medical sales people on ebay, so I was relieved.  I also found one comment from a seller that said, ""great international buyer"" which also gave me some comfort.

The only problem is I never remembered adding international shipping, and there is no way at the moment to change my shipping, which is a $90 FedEx ground charge.  It's about 5 ft tall and 30 inches by 30 inches wide after it's packed I'd guess.

So I called up FedEx to guestimate the cost of a package that was a bit longer and more weight, just to err on the costly side, and hope it was less. OVER $1000!!!! for international heavy freight!  That is INSANE.  If the sale went through, I'd OWE over $100+ dollars to cover shipping + fees.

Anyone with experience in this department?  I'm hoping he may have me ship to a US address...there is still 5 days left on it so.  I have to go out for a few now but when I get back I need to call ebay and have this dealt with.

Ebay,Semi-amateur Seller Questions,"I've been selling on eBay for about 7 years now. I sell maybe 15-20 things a year. It seems like in the past year, the power has severely shifted toward the buyer. I get many more unpaid items now or returns for no real reason other than the buyer doesn't want the item. I just have a few questions for other sellers.

1. What is an acceptable amount of time to expect payment? I've never bid on anything on eBay that I couldn't pay for within 2-3 days of auction end. But I've got people that wait 10 days to pay, tying up money and my item.

2. Is there anything more you can do to a buyer who doesn't pay other than giving them a no-payment strike and hope that it hurts what they can bid on in the future?

3. When eBay rewrites their policies, do they ever ask opinions of sellers? I feel like I've had one or two surveys in the past sent to me, but I think a lot of buyers would agree, something needs to change to balance the power a little more. 

Thanks for any answers/opinions you can give.",3,2,2012-12-02,EBAY,0.03813128173351288,0.9140386581420898,0.04783003032207489
Ebay,Had 4 prepaid packages outgoing first class USPS on my porch and they were stolen. What can I do?,"I send out about 2 packages a day through USPS's prepaid shipping service and haven't had any problems in the years I've been doing this.

I had my packages in the lobby of my apartment complex and the tracking info hasn't been updated, even though they've spent a few days in transit.

I fear that the packages were stolen from lobby, since no information has been received by USPS for accepting these packages.

The value of the packages ranges from $10.00 for 3 of them and $100.00 for 1 of them.

I didn't purchase any insurance, as I've never had any problems in the 1,000+ times I have done this.

Ebay,Just realized the auction i'm winning is faulty/factory reject,"Hey guys. ... my bad, i know. 

The plush (stuffed doll) i'm bidding on has a picture, which I didn't realize shows it's faulty in its stitching and stuffing. It's likely a factory reject.  

The item is listed as ""NEW Pokemon Umbreon 6"" Plush - RARE POKEMON CENTER USA TAG"" 

There's no mention of faultiness, but there's also no mention of otherwise, except saying that it's ""new and clean.""

I know I am at fault here, and I will bite the bullet if i have to, but what are my options at this point? (Ideally, I don't want this product. Auction ends in 6 hours.) 
Coincidentally, I messaged the seller yesterday asking if her plushes were faulty. She hasn't replied. Hadn't noticed it in the picture yet.

Ebay,Running Out of Inventory - Help Needed!!!,"I originally had around 300-400 brand new sealed items to sort, and list on Ebay. It took me some time, since each one was different to picture, research, find post etc.. I've gone trough some of it and still have some of them active. However, at this point given If I finish all these sales I may be able to find another 200-300 items around the house in used condition to list and I'll be dry after that. 

I wanted to get ideas on how to get new inventory. My current inventory is little bit of everything, all new from different sales trough the years mostly electronics in the $20-$40 price range. I'm not really the type to go to storage auctions, household yard sales or constantly make craigslist offers and drive all over town to pick up individual items one by one. 

Also individual units have really taken a big chunk of my time to sort trough and list manually. I'm not greedy, and am looking for a steady sells. I'm looking more into quantity sales. As in one item listed once, with perhaps 200-300 quantity. Has any of you done that? What are some great quantity sell items to invest in, and make a little on each one and keep busy, yet make decent profit on? Where should I start looking?

Ebay,Sellers - Do you refund outside of the resolution centre?,"As you know a major problem on eBay are buyers misusing returns and abusing buyer protection on eBay.

Just wondering. I notice that sellers just issue refunds through PayPal and not through the resolution centre.

A lot of sellers seem to think that we don't want cases getting opened and will punish you for it. This is not true; we just don't want them opened and ignored.

If you make sure cases are opened for all refunds, we can easily identify scammers and misusers by trends and make eBay a much safer place to do business on. You may also find that when you request a buyer to open a case, they will lose interest in the refund or partial refund because they are trying to stay under the radar.

As it stands, if I do re-list the item or offer it to someone else, there is still a transaction fee I would have to pay from the original sale unless I jump through all the ebay hoops, correct?

I just think it's disheartening to have to wait 7 days for an auction to end, then wait for another 4 days, report a payment as not paid, wait another four days, and then being able to resell the item per ebay's policy.

Ebay,eBay Features and Subsciption differences,"Why does eBay Australia have so many fewer features than the ebay.com site? 

For example reserve prices are offered on every auction, while this feature is not available for Australian eBayers. 

Subtitle features are 50c for Americans and $2.00 for Australians. 

Store subscriptions are $15.95 for basic, and $49.95 for Featured.

Store subscriptions are $49.95 for basic and $49.95 for Featured for Australians.

Why? Why such a huge difference in costs? And don't give me that BS about higher wages. Sure we have higher min. wages than America, but that doesn't justify 4x the price of existing features, missing features and more than 3x the price of a basic store! 

I was thinking about upgrading to a Store just for multiple Buy It Now's. If it were $15.95 per month I wouldn't hesitate. But $49.95 for Basic? I might as well get Featured! It's the same price with more features. Features I don't need yet, as the basic store meets my current needs. 

Why such a huge difference between the two sites? 

Should I just stay on the eBay.com page and avoid eBay.com.au all together?

If I type in eBay.com, while being logged into eBay.com.au, I can see all my info, sale data, watch list, etc. eBay treats it as the same site. So, what happens if I subscribe to the $14.95 basic store than the $49.95 Australian Basic store?

Leaves me ""positive"" feedback but he actually doesn't. Through use of filters I was able to find out that although he clicked green he gave me 1 star for as many ratings as he could. 

In addition to this I shipped next working day and responded to his original email within 30 minutes, so obviously these cannot be 1 star, but they actually can when you employee people who can't do their job properly.

So I have proof he extorted me, ebay will do nothing, I wonder if any emloyee on here can help me?

Ebay,I bought 2 concert tickets for cheap that are now worth much more...,"I recently bought 2 tickets from a guy in Arizona to a Louis CK show scheduled for dec 22nd. i go to college in the midwest and i'm visiting family in arizona, got the tickets as a gift. recently Louis CK rescheduled it for mid February and is now taping his next HBO special that night, and now i cant go. i checked on ebay for listings for tickets and they have all doubled if not tripled in price from what i bought them for.

Ebay,"5 star DSRs, 100% positive, selling for 5 years, and eBay doesn't want me listing auctions?","Hi all, I need your collective wisdom on what to do here...

I've always sold stuff on eBay for the past few years using auctions, because stuff I sell is better priced by my customers, instead of me. I have more than 2000 positive feedback with zero negative, and DSRs that are about as close to 5 as is humanly possible. 

Yet, a few weeks ago, eBay decided to limit me from listing auctions. I didn't get any notice, except that when I try to post auctions it tells me the following: ""In order to maintain a safe trading environment and based on the eBay Buyer’s Experience (“BBE”) of the respective seller, a limitation on the number of auction items an eBay seller can list in a period of 30 rolling days will be imposed (30 day limitation).We regret to inform you that you have hit the 30 day limitation.""

This sucks, obviously, so I called to try to figure out what's going on. I've gotten a different answer every single time I called. They are as follows:

1) It's just a monetary amount limit - I'm selling more than usual so eBay flagged me and I'll be allowed to sell again once the number goes down. I should talk to seller vetting.
2) Seller vetting says it's related to my Paypal account
3) I called Paypal, who says it's not them
4) The next rep says I've shipped out some items late, therefore it constitutes bad buyer experience, and I'll never be able to relist auctions again. 
5) The next one says it's related to something about shipping, maybe, but I need to talk to the Hong Kong office (I moved to Hong Kong last year) because they put the limit on me
6) The Hong Kong office claims it's because I am not meeting BBE, but when pressed for a more precise answer, simply claims ""it's made up of many things, I can't tell you which one is causing you problems""

Since I still have no idea what exactly is wrong, I have no idea how to fix it. I seem to be meeting all the requirements - no claims against me, no negatives, no rule violation, and worst of all, no communication from eBay about what I did wrong at all - and nobody seems to have a clue what's happening.

Funny enough, they are letting me list fixed-price, just not auctions. I'm not even sure what the logic there is.

Ebay,PISSED OFF at eBay retraction feature.,"First of all, you have no idea how much self-constraint I am using right now, not posting the asshat eBayer's username or info.

I have an item on eBay that I am starting at around the £200 price mark, and the listing ends today, just 10 days from Christmas. This would make Christmas a lot less of a struggle to say the least!

Asshat eBayer bids on my item, retracts the bid several hours later, with the reason being ""entered wrong amount"".  The guy was the first bidder, so expected him to come back with his right bid, but nothing happened.  After doing some logical searching for other items like mine, turns out that he's bidded on several of the same items at the same time, then later retracted the higher priced ones, but keeping his bids on the lower priced items.

I checked the guys eBay history and he's retracted twice in the last 30 days, and seven times over the last 6 months!  

It severely pissed me off that eBay had done nothing to this clown, so here is the message I sent to him.

""
Oh hi there, I noticed that you bidded on my ITEM for PRICE, and then retracted your bid because you entered the wrong amount. lol, that's OK, but as eBay policy states, you now have to re-enter the correct amount as you are the first bidder, and you had the intention of bidding, and if you won, paying for my item as stated by the eBay bidding policy.

I do see that I was not the only person you've done this to, you've done this seven times in the last 6 months! Maybe you need a less sticky keyboard? I'm sure you can get a better one on eBay.

Just one last query, I noticed that you bidded on not only MY ITEM, but also someone else's ITEM less than a minute later, do you need more than one ITEM? Funny how the other person's is a quarter of what I'm selling mine for at the moment, you didn't enter the wrong amount there, did you.

If you do not do this, I will have no other choice but to report this violation of the rules and policy to the eBay customer support team.

Thank you!

I received replies from both, ebay said to do what i already did, to contact the seller and arrange to get a refund and return the ds.
The seller said he would give me a refund and to send the item back.

I then sent another message to the seller telling him I would send it.

So I sent it back via tracking 1st class TO THE ADDRESS ON THE SHIPPING LABEL THAT ARRIVED ON THE DS' PACKAGE.

I was on ebay today, turns out the seller actually replied, he gave me A DIFFERANT ADDRESS to return it to.

I then contacted the seller saying wtf.

Then I sent an email to ebay customer services informing them of the situation and asking them what to do.

Ebay,"International buyer purchased an iPhone 4s from me, after payment asked if I could unlock it, problems ensue.","So, about a month and a half ago I listed my old iPhone 4S (for Verizon) and it sold to a buyer in China (I'm in the United States). After the buyer paid for it, he sent me a message asking if I could unlock it, otherwise he would not be able to use the phone. 

He sent me a link to a Verizon forum that explained how to do an international unlock on the existing sim card. I followed those steps and assumed all was okay. He received the phone and the type of unlock I did was not what he needed. 

After several (and I mean way over 30) emails, I told him I would refund him $20 to pay for the software to unlock the phone so he can use it with China Mobile. I'm still concerned that he will try to file a paypal claim. 

In this circumstance, what protection is there for the seller? I've done so much to try to handle this for the guy, and I know there is a language barrier because every email is in very broken English, as if translated by some online translator. Because of how long it took for the package to get to him, he's only got until the 30th to file a claim with paypal. I'll be on the edge of my seat until then because I can not afford to lose $350.

Also, a secondary question, when someone files a claim with paypal and there are no funds in the paypal account, will it attempt to withdraw the money from my bank account to hold in paypal?

**EDIT** He sent me a message saying the software he tried to use wouldn't unlock the phone and gave me detailed instructions to call Verizon one last time to try to unlock it. He said he is sorry for all of the confusion and that he hopes he didn't just buy a 4S version of the iTouch. I'm going to try what he told me, and if it doesn't work, I don't know what we'll do. 

From what he's saying, though, I don't think he intends to file a claim and realizes that this is his own fault. I was so worried after he first paid that if I told him I could not unlock it, that he would just immediately leave me negative feedback. Now it has opened a whole 'nother can of worms.

Ebay,What's Your Rate of Sell On Inventory? New Store,"Hello, 

So I recently started an ebay store. Gradually I'm adding inventory into it. It's a one man show, from pictures to finding the category, listing, collecting of payment and lastly shipment / customer service. It usually takes me all day to list 10-15 items. The research part, takes a good majority of my time. Finding the right category, completed sale prices, writing up etc... 


I currently am adding all my new in box items, as a Buy It Now style auction. Currently the account has around 250 items. They are all set for automatic re-list after 30 days (Good Till Canceled). My prices are fair, however I'm not really trying to give them away for pennies on a dollar just to make a sale. With that in mind, I was wondering how long does it take for you veterans to move your inventory?


P.S I don't have any particular sector I focus on. I have everything from DVD's to clothes, to electronics and even car parts.",10,0,2012-12-17,EBAY,0.02599526196718216,0.9268783926963806,0.047126349061727524

Ebay,3 packages not updating tracking info. Been almost a week.,"Hello. I was hoping some more experienced ebayers could help me with a problem I am having.

 I sold 3 items to 3 different people and shipped them at the same time using USPS first class. I dropped them off at a USPS blue box that you see sprinkled around town. The mail carrier should have picked them up last Thursday. On all three packages, the tracking info only says that I printed the label and nothing else. No acceptance, nothing. 

Now the buyer's are wondering where their packages are. Is it possible that these packages are on their way? Should I be worried yet? I'm not sure what to do in this instance. I'm thinking about giving a full refund and explaining to the buyers what happened and hope and pray that they don't give me a negative feedback since 3 negative feedbacks would hurt me pretty bad. Also I want to do it all with ebay and make sure that I am following the rules. 

I would sure appreciate any advice from people who have been in this situation before. Thanks a lot.",14,2,2012-12-18,EBAY,0.038201574236154556,0.8680889010429382,0.09370950609445572
Ebay,"Holiday headache, would like some opinions from fellow eBay pros!","I made a purchase mid November on eBay for a nice backpack to give as a present, the product was shipped from china so it took about 3 weeks to arrive. Around week 2 I had forgotten about it until one day I checked the shipping status to find that it was already delivered, I checked on a Friday, and the tracking said it was delivered on Monday (4 days before) but I never received the package. I checked everywhere, my garage, my yard and surrounding area, I'm certain that it never reached my house. I messaged the seller asking for the address they sent to, and they replied with my correct address, so I called USPS and they said according to the logs it was delivered on a Monday. So am I just at a loss here? I shop online all the time so this is the first time its happened, and I live in a fairly good neighborhood so I'm sure no one just snatched it from my mailbox. I don't know if opening a case is fair to the seller because they honored their end, I called USPS customer support last week and they just told me if no insurance was paid then they're responsible even if the delivery person delivered to the wrong door.

Ebay,Yay for idiot buyers...,"So I sold this to a guy in Italy... no biggie.  They buyer also has private feedback and I curious as to why...  He gets it today and sends me this message: 

I received a tube 8233 different, from that shown in the photo of the auction.

The Sylvania box is the same of the photo, but the tube 8233 is very bad... with black spots on the inside, and the external white logo consumed and almost erased.
You have kept the good valve shown in the photo of the auction, and you sent me a bad valve, very much used, valueless.

As for his claims: 

I sent the same box and tube shown.
The logo and etc.. was already worn and fading as can be seen in the pic and maybe the rest wore off in shipping...IDK.
I've no idea what he means by spots on the inside...

I've sold through about half the the 6000 tubes and only had three ""problems"" so far, two of which were my fault and I took care of them... and then this guy. ..  New 8233 tubes go for around $40-45 and I guess this guy thought he was going to get a new one for less than $15...

I wouldn't mind so much if he wasn't accusing me of ""stealing"" the ""good"" one. Seeing that I only had one of that model to begin with...  I understand that some people can disappointed when buying un-tested tubes and they turnout to be bad, but don't come blaming me because you have buyers remorse, from buying an un-tested, probably used,  tube and it turns out to be exactly that.

Ebay,How should a seller set up pack quantities?,"Hi r/ebay

Hi all, can you help explain to me how eBay handles pack quantities?

I've just been given duties relating to this, and the seeming complexity of it all is beyond me and putting my job at risk (sorry! i'm really giving you guys the heavy sell here ...please help)

What it is, my firm is seeking to offload some of its stock onto ebay, they'll be sold in pack quantities (e.g. pack of 10 bolts) at a Buy-It-Now price, but as i rummage round eBay's ""help"" it's confusing.

There's selling ""multiple identical items"" which is associated with the Quantity field, i've tried a dummy run on this and eBay throws back an error saying i've overrun the amount of items i can list per month, i suppose because the eBay shop is new..but that's another thing.

So if i sell a pack of 10 bolts do i put ""1"" or ""10"" in the quantity field, i tried ""10"" and ran into the error, so i guess it's 1 as it refers to what constitutes a pack, if that's the case why does eBay help imply otherwise, and that items, item numbers and listings do not necessarily correspond.

tl;dr - don't know how ebay handles pack quantities - help",6,3,2012-12-20,EBAY,0.05178229883313179,0.9152891039848328,0.032928623259067535
Ebay,Buyer bought an item with a U.S. address and is demanding that I ship to Canada.,"Buyer has 10k+ feedback, 99.9% pos.

The item sold today and she paid with a PayPal account that was registered to a street address in Florida. I received [this](http://i.imgur.com/J0sFp.jpg) message after the payment had cleared, asking if I can ship to Canada.

[As it clearly states in my item description, I do not ship outside of the U.S.](http://i.imgur.com/fOxba.jpg)

[It is also stated directly underneath the bidding area.](http://i.imgur.com/lxfea.jpg)

I figured it might be worth a shot - I'm still fairly new to selling and have never shipped outside the US - so I went ahead and tried to print the label and figured I could just bill her for the difference. However, when I tried to change the shipping address it wouldn't let me change the destination country/region, [it was greyed out on the U.S. option.](http://i.imgur.com/P6nfg.jpg)

I [replied as such...](http://i.imgur.com/K1bLO.jpg)

And [this was her response.](http://i.imgur.com/SUNGQ.jpg)

I also noticed that, as I was reading these in my gmail, it showed her eBay e-mail ending with @members.ebay.ca. So am I to believe that she has a land address in Florida, uses the eBay CA site, buys from US sellers and has them pay the shipping difference at the post office? Seems kind of sketchy to me, but what do I know..

What's the best course of action to take here? A small flat rate international box is 12.95; should I just bill her for the difference? I apologize if this seems like a newbie question.

Ebay,Looking for advice/input because I think I f**ked up on international shipping.,"Okay, I've been an eBay member since 2001. I have 100% positive feedback and a score of over 110. I usually buy, but I've sold some things too, but have always kept it simple and only shipped to the USA. Until recently. I sold an iPhone 4 and figured since eBay was flooded with them, I'd sell internationally for a broader audience. The phone ended up selling to a fellow in Russia. I charged a flat rate of $20 for international shipping figuring I'd either make a little or lose a little depending on where it was going. 

Once PayPal cleared his payment to me, I boxed it up and took it to my local UPS Store and was told that UPS Shipping would cost over $300. The same guy at the same store also told that USPS would cost $67 (if I were to ship it via USPS from this store). Thinking I was screwed, I remembered that there was an option to print my mailing label/purchase postage at home. I had never done that before and wanted to see if it would be cheaper. Racing back home, I input the size and weight of the package (rounding up on the weight just to be safe) and printed a USPS 1st Class International Mail shipping label, was charged $13.17 and off to the post office I went. This was December 4th. As of December 20th my buyer still states he does not have the package. My shipping method did not include a tracking number, it only has a US Customs Declaration number so I have no idea where the hell it is. I've never shipped international before so please tell me how bad I've fucked up and if you all know of anything I could/should do now. I see the following possibilities:

1) The package arrives within the next few days and all is well in the end.

2) The package is lost in transit without a tracking number and I will have to refund the money I made from selling the item and I will no longer have the item.

3) The buyer gets pissed and *says* he doesn't have the item when he actually does and forces me to refund his money, thus I just gave away a free iPhone.

Ebay,Venting about a buyer who is accusing me of having someone bid against him to drive up a price on my items.,"Been selling collectable anime stuff off and on for about 10 years now.
Never came across a buyer this confrontational before.
In an item description, I mentioned that I would like payment within 24 hours.  Nothing to terrible, mind you.  I've seen sellers insist on instant payments.

Anyway, I wait all day for the winning bidder to pay.  I had already sent an invoice.
Then I thought ""maybe he's bidding on other items and wants to save on shipping costs"".  No big deal.

So I just message him asking:

Dear Derp,
Just wanted to check if you're waiting on how other auctions end.
Thanks!

Tonight I get his dickheaded response:

Dear gordonp,
I'm not accusing you of anything but that other ebay member whose feedback is ""private"" who pushed the bidding higher and higher for this item seems suspicious to me. Anyways I'm a waiting for another auction to end. I know you posted yoou wanted to get paid in 24 hours but Ebay allows me to pay in 4 days, that's not my rule that's their rule. You'll get paid so don't worry about it even though the bidding seemed suspicious to me.
- Derp

I guess he doesn't understand that when multiple people are bidding on the same piece, that tends to push the price higher.
And eBay want sellers to wait 4 days to receive payment until you report a seller for non-payment.

I don't know the bidder with the private feedback.  I've sold to others with private feedback and have had no issues.  I just don't care for the tone of the message he sent.  It just seemed like a shitty thing to say.

I had buy it now prices set to 10% above the value of the cards figuring what the heck and knowing that gift cards sell for above face value for whatever reason (money laundering?).

Anyway, both gift cards sold to the same person within 24 hours, using buy it now, who immediately sent me $495 via PayPal.  She also sent a note (via eBay messaging, attached to the transaction) asking for the PIN &amp; code to be sent via eBay messages back to her.

The PayPal account is confirmed and located in the United States

My question:  Is this safe?  I'm suddenly having second thoughts, especially with them selling so high.  I don't really care if this person is laundering money or whatever, that's their business, but are there any chargeback avenues that I'm missing?  Gift cards seem like they fall outside of the ""item not as described"" scam since their use can be verified.  And sending the codes via eBay messaging ensures that they can't claim the card was lost in the mail.

What am I missing?

If you haven't done an automatic payment with paypal, is it possible for you to make the payment on your own?

After I receive your payment I will ship them as soon as possible.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience.

here's what I'm dealing with:

**I'm not happy with your customer service.  Am I misunderstanding anything?  The listing said $10 for ground shipping.  You were not authorized to cancel the entire transaction.  Please reply promptly with your response or I will issue a complaint with ebay.  Please tell me why you are unable to ship this item for $10.  Thank you, Brian.**

I send pictures, explain, 5 times. Nope. I refund full amount after the third email. Still he's msging. I try to cancel transaction (money refunded in full at this point, just need to cancel the sale itself.) Nope. he won't budge. He just keeps repeating messages like the one above. Not facing the fact that the sale said $20. No... the problem is with me that I can't lower my price... because he says so.

This is what he puts in the reason for not cancelling the ebay transaction:


**I interpreted the listing as saying that shipping would cost $10 ground, I was charged $20.  Seller is saying that since he lives in Canada, the price is $20.  I asked seller if he can ship ground for $10 as listing stated.  Seller said no and refunded the entire amount I paid.  I was only asking for a $10 refund for the difference in shipping charged.  I still want the item, but feel that $20 shipping for such a small item is not fair considering I interpreted the listing as $10 ground shipping**

So because he *interpreted* the price being lower, he wants to pay that, instead of what *it says right there in the sale* After I sent him pictures with big red circles to explain it twice. 

this is like saying ""I made a boo boo, you pay for it.""


Nope.  I lose money on sales all the time because I hold to my word and follow agreements of sale no matter what. I'm not losing money on this sale.


Hundreds of great deals bought and sold and bullshit like this makes me not want to use ebay ever again.


*edit: he's still at it. 3 more messages. Wants me to ship with fed-ex now. He doesn't get it...


*edit 2: he sent 3 more pointless messages. I think he's finally given up. Yay!

*edit 3: another message received.  This time it's about politics and stuff.


**If Ebay agreed with me that you were the one to detail the shipping info. and you changed your listing to a straight $20, then why are you telling me I am wrong. This doesn't make sense. You attack me for something that you are more than half to blame. Then you say you are honest and would have taken a loss on shipping if you had made a mistake. Again, not a true statement. This piece is missing most of its parts and there is no guarantee it will work. I will likely need to weld it to an attachment devise and spend time and $ to make it work. $40 is a fair price. You could have put it in an envelope and mailed it for probably $10. Yet you didn't even look into it. Now that you will list for the correct shipping price of $20, let us see what the true value will be. Again, I will accept the sale with $10 shipping.

Ebay,Do I have a right to be frustrated if the garment I bought has a hole in it?,"UPDATES BELOW

I bought a sweater and a skirt on eBay, sold 'as is' and in 'pre-owned' condition. I did not know there was a huge hole in the sweater that cannot be repaired. There was no way you could see the hole in the photos, which had the garments layered so the hole was invisible in all of the shots. Of course, no returns allowed. 

Best course of action? Do I complain through feedback, get in touch with eBay? I don't want to ruin the seller's rep, but I feel there was a total lack of transparency. Sold 'as is' and 'pre-owned' is not synonymous with damaged, and trying to hide it.

Your advice is much appreciated.

UPDATE:

1. I emailed seller, informing him I received the top - not the skirt - in damaged condition, and I asked for a partial return or a return. 
2. He writes me the below response:
                       
Dear ---.

In all honesty I do not have a clue of what you are talking about nor i am aware of any ""hole"" in the skirt. The items were listed ""as is"" because they were used. 
They used to belong to my wife that gained weight and couldn't wear them anymore. I can assure you that there wasn't any damage when i mailed to you. 
I am well aware of the terms and conditions of ebay because, being an attorney, i read everything before i make any decision. I truly simpatize with your situation and, in your shoes, i would feel the same way. My obligation was to list the item truthfully and disclose any kind of damage to the items if there was any. 
There was not any hole in either piece when the items where shipped. 
Whatever happened to the skirt must have occurred while in transit from here to your place.

Ebay,Newbie here - have some questions.,"Hello, I am trying to find out about selling a certain product from China to the US via eBay.  

Is it true that I must use a certain kind of postal service to ship/send products from China to the US?

If so, what are the approx. costs of this service per kilo?  What additional fee per each additional kilo?

If I don't need to use this particular postal service can I send via ship instead of by air?  I have seen some products for sale on eBay from China that say delivery time is around 10 - 14 days.  This is faster than by sea I am sure, but much slower than air, so I'm confused what delivery this may be.

Thank you in advance.",2,2,2012-12-27,EBAY,0.019503461197018623,0.9228629469871521,0.05763363838195801

Ebay,Here it comes... buyer saying phone he bought *doesnt work*,"At the beginning of the month, I sold a phone (LG G2X) to a guy with 0 feedback. He just now messaged me and says the phone doesn't work and he wants me to take it back. This is the message he wrote me:  

*I purchased this phone as a gift for my daughter however when we got it we waited till christmas to give it to her so today when she went to turn it on we found out the phone DOES NOT WORK. The speaker in the ear piece is no good.We asked about having it repaired but they wanted more than the purchase price of the phone.How can we make this right? I will be glad to send the phone back due to the fact I had to purchase another phone today. My daughter was soo anxious to have this phone she was heart broken when it didn't work so i bought her a diffrent one today. Let me know what your thoughts are on this matter? Thank you for your time on this matter.*  

I had been using this phone as my primary phone up until a week before I sent it out. I had the phone a year and a half and never had any problems. I packaged the phone well, got DC and insurance. I messaged him back saying:  

*I had been using the phone as my primary phone up until about a week before I sent it out. I checked it right before I mailed it and it was still working. I never had any problems with the phone in the year and a half that I had it. The only thing I can think of that could have happened is something during the mailing process. I insured the phone incase anything were to happen to it. My best advice is to take it up with the post office. I don't offer returns, especially since I have perfect feedback and I would hope that you'd trust that I would not send you something that didn't work. I wouldn't jeopardize my eBay account for that. I hope I can work with you to help solve this, but I cannot take the phone back. Did the repair shop say exactly what was wrong with the phone? Maybe you could describe to me more what is going on and I could help you troubleshoot it. Did you try using a headset with the phone and seeing if that took care of the problem? Does the screen show a headset in the top right hand corner? If so, try plugging and unplugging a set of headphones in until it goes away.*  

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing? Basically, should I start figuring out how to get ~$100 together cause PayPal/eBay will probably side with this guy? It's things like this that make me not want to sell on eBay anymore, I swear to god. Why can't people just be honest.

Ebay,"[ebay newbie] Is it possible to purchase a Galaxy s3 to be delivered to a US address, from outside the US (Israel)?","Hello,

I know someone who is visiting the US soon. I wanted to purchase a Galaxy s3 (i9300) phone on eBay to be delivered to the address where he is staying, so that he could bring me the phone to Israel when he comes back (since the phones are much cheaper than in Israel). However, I have no idea how I should do this.

I have purchased very few small items from eBay before (to be delivered to Israel), and my pay pal address and credit card are Israeli. I'm not sure if it will let me choose a US address. I cant even check the delivery options since it doesn't even let me change the country unless I use a proxy.

I'm especially interested in auctions, since I have noticed it is possible to get the phone for about $500 in an auction, which is much cheaper than the price in Israel (about $700).

It is also very important for me that the delivery will be while he is still in the US, so it cant be delayed. I'm also worried about any problems that might arise, because since I am not in the US it will be difficult for me to sort problems with the delivery company or with the seller. I'm also not sure what delivery option I should choose (I don't even know what options I have).

Is there a way for me to arrange this? Do you think it is worth it, or the risk is too high and I should avoid it?

Ebay,Is there any money &amp; profit in DVDs?,"Hello, 

I recently posted my personal DVD inventory on Ebay. My current inventory is at 300 DVD's and a few VHS’s. I price them extremely generous. For example if it says a brand new one is for sale from a power seller for $6, I put mine for $2.99. I also add $2.99 shipping on all items. I've been steadily selling them, but haven't really seen a huge sell volume. I'm maybe averaging 5-6 DVD's a day. I had a few questions for DVD seller veterans here. 

My first question is, with all these (Chinese) vendors sending DVD’s from overseas, is there still any profit in DVD’s as someone living in the USA? How do you compete with their prices, since most of the time it’s $0.99 + $1.99 shipping or even lower. Do any of you sell DVD's? If so, I'd take all your suggestions kindly from inventory, to pricing, to shipping and everything in between.

Also is it best to offer free shipping but add the cost to the original price? I don't know if the brain psychology would prefer that in such regards. If I sell a DVD for $2.99 + 2.99 (Shipping), I feel like customers would feel more incline to buying that combination vs seeing $5.98 + free shipping. I know there is the automated Lowest Price + Shipping option, but do a lot of people really use that? I don’t want it to work against me. Lastly since I'll be getting charged 10% of my total sale. Would it also work against me to include the shipping into the price? I know there is a shipping fee charge, but didn’t know if it was the same rate as the final value sale.

Ebay,Concern about resolution of damaged item returned,"I sold a new motherboard and offered returns.  The buyer contacted me saying they could not get the RAID feature working with their old hard drives, this could be due to a number of issues.

 The buyer had a separate motherboard fail with the hard drives setup in RAID.  To see the RAID again you have to buy another motherboard with the same RAID controller(that mine had).  

Since he could not get it working he wanted to return the item which was fine. When he returned the item I noticed visible damage to plastic components and the battery had been switched with a completely different one that had all scratches.  

I contacted ebay telling them I cannot accept this return.  They informed me to contact the buyer and let him know when I cannot accept this item and send it back.  I let the buyer know I was returning the item and he has now opened a case as expected. He stated the item is damaged and worthless to him. I responded to the case with all this info and informed them I have mailed the item back.

My question, how is ebay going to decide on this?  I planned on sending the item Monday but now I am worried they will just give him his money back and let him keep the motherboard.
