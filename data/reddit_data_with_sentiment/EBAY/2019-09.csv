Ebay,650+ Items. Sales almost dead this month,Just wondering if anyone else had really slow sales this month.  I know summer is generally slow for everyone but this past month has been killing me.  What's weird is June and July were both great for me and those are usually pretty slow months.  August has just been horrible this year for some reason.,33,53,2019-09-01,EBAY,0.7364960312843323,0.24833770096302032,0.015166246332228184
Ebay,Customer mad at me that he didn’t read the details??,"Customer bought a piece of clothing. Detailed sizing/dimensions were in the details area. I don’t accept refunds on preowned as a rule, but will honor it occasionally if customer seems well intentioned (not just “I didn’t check your listing I just bought it...you should be like amazon and accept all returns because this is too tight/colors wrong/I changed my mind!”)


Sold buy it now for 15$ with free priority shipping. 


Customer asks if they can return it because it is too small....


I’m polite, I say I can do a partial refund for half the cost, but otherwise I don’t typically accept returns on preowned clothes. 


They reply days later with this: “Um excuse me? I see NOW If you clickthru for more detail you DID say it’s sizing and that it ran small, which I did not do before I bought. If something runs small you should say something before the sale is completed!!!”


LOL! Should I make a new policy that when someone goes to my buy it now listings and pays I should send an email with the full description they may have neglected to read? How else do I give more details besides the intended area of details. Sigh

Ebay,Beginning Seller Tip: You can automatically pass your eBay shipping discount to your buyer through preferences,"The difference between eBay's shipping discount and USPS retail rates can be pretty big. So you might have noticed when using calculated shipping that the buyer often pays more than shipping. This could be to your favor, but it could also reduce sales. I realize most sellers know this, but for new sellers, you can use calculated shipping with the discounted prices. Your buyer sees what you pay. I just see questions about this from time to time. It might or might not make sense for you.

From eBay:

To offer eBay-negotiated discount rates:

Go to My eBay &gt; Account &gt; Site Preferences

Next to Shipping preferences, click Show

Next to Offer carrier-specific discounts to buyers, click Edit

Select the radio button for Offering cheaper/online discounted shipping rates for your listing, then select the check mark next to one or more of the options:

USPS discounted

FedEx eBay discounted

UPS eBay rates

Click Save Settings

Happy shipping.

Edit: If passing these into the buyer doesn't work for you, don't do it. I've seen people ask the question here and elsewhere. I was answering. Had no idea it would cause butthurt.  If your weight is correct, so is the charge. Again, this is **how** you do it, not that you necessarily should do it.",24,14,2019-09-01,EBAY,0.06428559124469757,0.9080637097358704,0.027650702744722366

Ebay,"Listing old laptop for sale, what OS should I ship?","I have an old circa 2007 HP laptop I've had kicking around for ages. Meant to sell it years ago but just kind of forgot about it. Well now it's got Windows Vista installed and from my perspective that's not a very great selling point.

Anyway, I've had plenty of experience loading laptops with Linux distributions, I have an old ThinkPad I just installed Linux Mint on. But what's the most attractive option for buyers? Just ship with the default (now defunct) OS? Or would I get a better offering with a more current, albeit more obscure, operating system? 

It's not really much trouble for me to install Linux, and it actually breathes new life into old computers. But obviously not everyone is going to love a Linux machine, or yet others inexplicably actually like old versions of Windows that are no longer supported, even if they run as fast as molasses. I would just pony up and buy a copy of Windows 10, but I'll probably not even get enough from the laptop to cover the price of Windows 10. Or would it be worth digging up a copy of the nearly retired Windows 7?

So what's the best strategy as a seller?",4,2,2019-09-01,EBAY,0.018259024247527122,0.879223644733429,0.10251732170581818

I thought about it for a sec. Seem like buyer would be difficult and I want to straight up ban but I've been doing that a lot lately.
I even got an apology from some guy I banned made me feel bad.
Not bad enough to unban him but enough to second guess myself in the future.


So I think maybe it's me maybe I'm just to jagged and should try to work with this guy. I was just about to reply to message then thought Better check feedback just to sure. And yep instincts were 100%.

Found he like to neg plenty of sellers. Also other sellers say he is very demanding buyer.

1""Buyer was demanding and unreasonable so i cancelled to prevent chargeback""

2.""Buyer threatened to open case at time of purchase, so I canceled the order.""

""Worked w me to resolve listing ambiguity, very helpful seller, great service""

Ebay,Buyer is asking to not require signature confirmation $1100 order,"I had a buyer that bought two items, with a total value of around $1100 (around $550 for each item).

Edit (2 weeks later): just thought I would update...I ended up shipping the two items separately (so I would still get buyer's protection on each item).

Ebay,"Seller sent item to wrong address, tracking says it’s delivered so I can’t get a refund. What can I do?","I bought an item from an overseas seller. It didn’t arrive. The seller has ignored my messages but provided a fake tracking number so I opened a dispute. The seller entered the correct tracking number so the case was automatically closed. I contacted the Royal Mail who informed me the item was delivered by them but not to my address but is in the same post code. They said they can’t tell me the address it was sent to despite me having the tracking details as it’s a breach of data protection law. 

I appealed the case with eBay and they said I needed to get a denial of receipt form from Royal Mail. Royal Mail said they can’t issue me with one because it was delivered just not to my address. What can I do to get a refund? How do I prove the parcel wasn’t sent to me? 
Thanks


EDIT:

I don’t know what a denial of receipt is it’s just something eBay asked for. Royal Mail can see the address on the tracking but I’m not allowed to know it.

I know that it's grayed out and I can't click on it probably because the item is no longer available, but I should still be able to see what I paid for the item as an eBay account user via mobile.

There is no good explanation for why they have not corrected this, they have the technical abilities to provide purchase history even if a listing is deleted it's just a purchase history.

Ebay,Questioning my No Return Policy &amp; other thoughts for discussion,"I'm wondering if my policy of seldom offering returns isn't hurting my sales. Especially, when all a customer has to do is say ""Not as Advertised"" and I'm pretty well hosed.

Also, I think I finally get why so many sellers will not ship internationally, even with eBay's shipping program. It's because of returns (I think). In most cases it is not worth your while to pay for return shipping. The customer may know this is a way to get the goods and get refunded. Really scary stuff.

It seems we are really at the mercy of the customers being honest. Enough dishonest customers and we are going to have to stop selling on eBay.

I feel that eBay, as a transaction facilitator is holding sellers to a higher standard than they would do if they were a retailer themselves. Yet, if I were in their shoes I can see why they have to have this policy of almost the customer is always right. 

These are just my observations, and it seems good to try to figure out what product categories may have customers who are of a higher integrity. Not an easy thing.",6,3,2019-09-06,EBAY,0.02416311390697956,0.9048176407814026,0.07101918756961823

Ebay,"Selling for 3 years, never had a major problem with buyers until now. Is this happening to anyone else?","The first was someone who sent me an offer for an item that I accepted, but didn't pay up. I messaged the buyer a few times over the course of a few days waiting for a response, but they never messaged me back or sent the money. Really annoying, but all I could do was file a UPI case and wait. 

eBay finally allowed me to close the case today and get my final value credit, and I figured that was it. I was also informed the buyer got a strike, which I felt was completely justified. Not long after this happened, the buyer suddenly messages with this sob story saying he had family members in the hospital, he couldn't check his messages at all, and he was really unhappy about the strike. Yet when I checked his feedback, there was one from a seller saying he had won an auction and never paid up. It was from last year, so I hadn't initially seen it when I accepted his offer... Very suspicious if you ask me. So he couldn't message me at all during the course of a week, yet he was able to message me immediately after receiving the strike to tell me how unhappy he was about it? He also told me he was still interested in buying the item if I would let him. NOPE.

Then the craziest thing happened today. I blocked a buyer for sending me an incredibly insulting offer for an item (over $40 off and he wanted free shipping to boot) because I don't want to deal with lowballers. Hours after this happened, I get a message from his WIFE demanding an explanation and asking what he could have possibly done to offend me. Who does this??? I haven't been able to reply to her because the message just left me speechless. Like, dude, are you really so offended over missing out on an eBay item that you get your spouse to harass the seller for you???

Ebay,"Seller forgot to include laptop PSU, is not responding, their company was dissolved the day I purchased the item. What do I do?","I purchased a laptop ""Refurbished"" and the seller left out the PSU, and HDD caddy. 

I messaged the seller, waited 3 days, no response. I messaged eBay, and they told me it to work with the seller, and if I don't get get a response for a few more days I should contact them again and they will open a return. I wait a few more days, and contact eBay again, and they open a return request... and still so response... in about a week I can ask eBay to step in.

But I get curious and search companieshouse.gov.uk for the return address, and find a company registered at that address, with a director with the same last name as the sender. Control of the company was handed over to a debt recovery company, and the company was dissolved on the day after my order was shipped. The next day the unit that the business was run from was listed as vacant, and the unit is empty. It even shows the desk where he photos were taken in the listing.

Obviously returning the laptop to that address will result in the laptop turning up at a vacant unit and either bouncing back to me or being signed for by someone from the buildings management and being sent to the debt recovery company.

But this time, the shipment was returned to my front door without any note on it.

Ebay,How to protect yourself as a seller,"Hi all! I’m an occasional seller on eBay. I just sell Retrogames and personal second hand stuff.

I tried to be very polite and understating in my replies but the buyer aggressively called me scammer and that I must send him a courier to pick up the good otherwise he would asked eBay/PayPal.

This is the first time this happened to me. I’m really offended by how this guy is trying to force on me something that is not the truth. I already called eBay and told them what happened and their suggestion was just to let the 3 days pass and later ask their intervention.

I discovered buying extremely cheap items on eBay has produced positive results for me, so I experiment with different cheap China-sold items in phases/segments.

I also sell a couple things here and there on my eBay account which isn't nearly my focus in regards to sales- I digress.

&amp;#x200B;

**Revelations:**

I've dealt with hundreds of Chinese sellers- so, naturally I've encountered patterns.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Manipulating search results:**

Literally **EVERY** China-based seller does this in *some* way- I'm sure you've even experienced it whether or not you realize it. (If you have recently experienced search result manipulation within the parameters of the rules, drop me your story!)

Because this is technically against the Terms &amp; Services agreement, they have found a loophole to ensure their product shows up first when searching ""Price Low-High"".

When creating a multi-item listing (%99.9 of their listings) they will always list 1 comparatively inferior, useless and cheap item in their listing. Sometimes the item isn't even a tangible thing. It ranges from a picture of words that says ""Random Gift of our choosing"" (uhh... wtf?) to a photo that says ""OUT OF STOCK"" even though the variant shows availability. But usually it is just a crappy version of an item in the same category.

This will ensure that the price range of that item begins at the top of the list when searching ""lowest price first""- appearing to be the cheapest on eBay, but **more importantly: appearing FIRST.**

This can be a major time killer when shopping as you can probably imagine.

This seems... I mean it's *allowed.* I guess. If they're selling that garbage item as well- I can't say much. It makes sense...ish. Enough.

&amp;#x200B;

**So I called their bluff...**

&amp;#x200B;

1. I tested them to see if they would actually sell that crappy .74 cent item if it seemed I could move it or put it to use somehow.
2. I found a certain category that I wouldn't mind paying for the cheap item if I did in-fact receive it. Let's just say, for example, it was: pillow cases with cool random prints and designs.
3. There were HUNDREDS of listings before I got to a real one that was actually the price it showed. I checked a few hundred of these listings (ya, probably 400)- EVERY SINGLE ONE had a lowest priced pillowcase that was plain, thin, boring- generally not the normal 'Best Selling' color. %99 of them only had 1 in stock (WOW, what a coincidence!)
4. So I bought like... 40 :)    Some from the same seller- some from different ones. Probably about 15 different sellers.
5. 12/15 sellers I bought multiple pillowcases from.
6. Of those 12, I got 7 private messages (all from separate accounts) claiming that they were out of stock of this item. Were you *really* out of stock or did you not expect someone to buy them for such a cheap price. Or did you ever have it in stock? All lies.
7. Did I mention that their messages were **ALL THE SAME?** Word for word.

Which brings me to my next revelation:

&amp;#x200B;

* **These sellers must be working symbiotically**

All signs point them either working together or owning separate accounts- which is against the rules.

**You can find and group a few users sometimes that have:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. After buying all these cheapest items, I was blocked by 6 accounts from making purchases. The same day. The same hour... whether or not they sent them. Which some did.
2. All have the same exact products.
3. They have the same descriptions.
4. Same listing dates
5. They have the same quantity amounts in stock/ or if something is out of stock- it will be the same item.
6. If you check the bidding history it will show the percentage that 1 account has bid on another. This is because
7. They use their multiple accounts to SHILL BID (raise the bidding price on an item using another account, family or friend's account)

&amp;#x200B;

* **I'm pretty sure they build up stars (points) for accounts then sell the account.**

&amp;#x200B;

1. I see many accounts that have 10-30 stars. So that means it's a fairly new account- okay.
2. I come across these accounts when looking for the lowest available price on an item. I asked myself ""Why are the lowest priced items on new accounts more often?""
3. It's pretty obvious: the lower the price, the faster the sell, the more stars of experience. Why are they in such a hurry to build up stars? OH
4. **TO SELL EXPERIENCED ACCOUNTS.** Clearly. This seems to be some of these people's game! 

 *(I wonder if there's a Chinese mafia- and if they have a hand in this conspiracy... I have* ***got*** *stop listing to Bert Kreischer &amp; Joe Rogan's podcasts...)*

1. They commonly have ALL the exact same listings as the accounts with thousands of stars. That's weird considering you're a brand new seller!

Ebay,"In the process of being taken by ebay for $4,000. PLEASE HELP!","A couple weeks ago we sold 5 batches (55 total) of computer processors to one buyer. The buyer received them and said that a few were missing capacitors and that they would like a refund for them. We said that we would gladly do that but requested photos to see the issues they were speaking about (Either way we were willing to refund them once they were returned.)

And that was when they stopped responding. They wouldn't respond to any of our message or attempts to work with them after that and then they opened a case with EBay. When we asked them about why they would open a case they said they ""didn't know how to make a label"".

So we call ebay about the case and say we've been trying to work with them but they simply aren't responding. The ebay rep tells us to print a label privately and send it to them and instructs us in how to do that. 

Then we get a notice that once the package is marked as received they will automatically receive a full refund. We call ebay to say that this is not correct. That they are returning only about 15 of the 55 processors. They tell us that they'll mark on the case that we're worried about being scammed so that the refund will not automatically go through.

CUT TO TODAY: Where we receive some of the processors back and a notice that they buyer has been fully refunded for all of them. We call Ebay and speak with someone who says that the previous rep told us to do the wrong thing and it was they're fault......then after speaking with someone she back tracks all of this and puts us on with a lovely witch of a person named Richelle who basically tells us that is:

All our fault
we should have give them the full refund
""You're not new to ebay so you should know what to do""
And that ""we're lucky to be getting this much back""

and in the mean time we're out about $4000 in product, and the buyer gets to not only keep all of the product, but receive a full refund on top of that and ebay is pretending to have their hands tied. 

WHAT THE FUCK CAN WE DO BESIDES GRAB OUR ANKLES?!

TLDR: Sold someone 55 items for $4k. They requested to return 15 of them and then stopped responding. Ebay told us how to handle the issues, we did exactly as they said, and now they're saying we did everything wrong and that's it's our fault for listening to they're employee who didn't know what they were doing.

Ebay,Does ebay read messages between users when solving a case?,"So I'm wanting to return an item that was not in the condition described by the seller.

I refuse that the issues has anything to do with transportation, and demand a full refund. He then wants to compensate me 100 euro (items was 1000 euro in total) and i refuse...

He then says that he is going to the hospital for a month and offers me 200 euro if i act fast and close the case (yeah right).. I still demand a refund, but says that i can wait 30 days for him to come back to the hospital, even though i think his story sounds fishy.

Ebay,"Seller sent item to the wrong address, what is my recourse in this situation?","So I bought an item on eBay that didn't originally come with a tracking number. I inquired about getting one 3 days ago. I got a reply and shipping number yesterday afternoon, and then shortly after it said it was delivered. It said it was delivered at a time I was home and I am 100% sure no one came to my house to drop the package off. 

I went to the post office to check what happened to my package. I live in a community of houses, so when the supervisor came back with the map of where my package was scanned. It was in my community but not at the right location for my house. I had reached out to the seller asking them to verify that they sent it to the right address. Turns out I've bought from this person before and they had the same issue of losing my package. They swear they put in the right address and says they sent it to ""23 your street"". I realize what happened and say, no it's ""123"" your street, not ""23"". They claim that is what they meant. 

Being skeptical I go over to the ""23"" address to see if they had my package. A lady answers the door and says that she has indeed gotten a package with my name on it, but with her address. She claims she sent it back to the USPS driver. Also confirms that she got a package for me in the past but gave it away. 

I have two questions here? 

1. If she gave back the package to USPS, would it show as delivered like it did on the eBay notifications?

2. If she did keep the package, what is my recourse to either getting the package or getting the seller to give me a refund for the wrong address issue?

I lost a $45 package from this guy once and put in a request for refund, and it was denied. Not realizing I bought a second package for over $100 this time, the same issue happens. In total I've given this guy $150, and I have nothing to show for it at the moment. Any advice would be appreciated. I can't eat another $100.

Update: Looks like the neighbor is lying about the package, but unfortunately USPS says they can't really take any action. The seller has agreed to refund me for this purchase. It's a shame it went down like this, but always remember to double or even triple check the labels you send out if you sell.",31,12,2019-09-11,EBAY,0.04658098891377449,0.9191934466362,0.03422553092241287

Ebay,Interesting new return case defect.,"I accepted a return on an item (on a friday aug 30th). A few days later a case is opened on the return (which was weird), then the case was put on hold. I got an ""eBay Message"" on Labor Day Sept 2nd( that I missed and am reading now) stating I had to send the buyer a label in 4 days. (Maybe if it was international that would make sense, nope, domestic sale)

**HOWEVER**

The email I got along with a ""Buyer opening a case"" email (both on Sept 2nd) states only the following:

""Thanks for trying to work with the buyer. Unfortunately, it looks like the issue wasn't resolved. We reviewed this case and decided to ask the buyer to return the item to you using an eBay-provided shipping label. If they use the label, the cost will be added to your next invoice.""

But the eBay message says otherwise:

""I've reviewed the details of the request and found that the best resolution is to ask the buyer to return the item to you for a full refund. Because the item was not as described, we're asking you to pay for the return postage.

I've placed the request on hold for 4 days to give you time to arrange the return postage with the buyer. Please note that if you don't resolve the issue by September 6, 2019 , we'll issue the buyer a full refund on your behalf without requiring the item to be returned.""


I actually got a defect for this. The money was refunded and the buyer kept the item.

I just called about it and the rep told me the buyer had a technical issue loading the original label, or possibly the eBay generated label the 2nd time. She was hard to understand. Unreal. Getting defects for technical issues.

Edit: The  ebay message actually was sent 7 minutes before the emails, so if anything the emails ""New"" instructions would override the ebay message instructions.

*Sellers who have been invited to managed payments can be required to register.*

Ebay,ebay now make it impossible to detect shill bidders by preventing access to who bidders have bid with,"Until very recently (last few days), you used to be able to detect shill bidders by looking at past bids of an auction by clicking on the e.g. 4 bids link, clicking on the username (e.g. 5\*\*\*3 (123)) and seeing how many bids have been placed with what seller (seller 1, seller 2, etc). Now, they've removed this link so you can't see.

So now, it's much easier for a seller to shill the bid price up without a buyer being able to detect it. and if you can't detect it, you can't complain to ebay, and they can't be responsible for turning a blind eye.

Ebay,A story of perseverance and ungrateful buyers,"I've received my first negative since I've started. [https://i.imgur.com/3UkUqeF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3UkUqeF.jpg) 

What bothered me was that I didn't even deserved it and it was made worse because I went out of my way to help. 

Buyer sent an offer with a message saying ""don't accept if it won't arrive by X date"". I have 2 postages, 3-5 days and next day. I accepted it because it was possible. She paid for the 3-5 days delivery, of course. I decided to do a good deed and pay the extra out of pocket for next day and let her know that. Just my luck, it was delayed, thanks UPS. Basically she wanted it for a wedding, ordered on Saturday for Tuesday. That's total BS.  

This is where the fun begins. [https://i.imgur.com/8zMuVda.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8zMuVda.jpg) 

Item arrived within the 3-5 day delivery date, it was what she paid for plus the threat for a bad feedback sent while it was within the delivery date should have been enough to have it removed so I contacted eBay. I was very content it was going to get sorted in my favour. 

Boy, was I wrong. [https://i.imgur.com/shuO76D.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/shuO76D.jpg) 

I was prepared to offer a full refund in exchange for a feedback removal, I worked too hard to have my perfect record tainted by this ungrateful twat. I figured I would try eBay one more time before I go grovel.

Ebay,Selling a phone on Ebay brings that crazies out,"So I posted an old iPhone 6 on Ebay, took pictures of every angle, put out a good description (its overall very good condition, 2 chips on the edges, glass and back are great) and list it for $100.  3 potential buyers contact me about an hour later, one via messages asks me to sell it to him for $80, another submits an offer for $82, and a third sends me an offer for $92.  I submit a counteroffer to the highest for $92 (just so my listing wouldn't end if he didn't pay).  

He accepts, and then before paying asks for the IMEI to make sure the phone is clean before he pays - he sends me this message 3 times within 15 minutes, because I didn't respond instantly.  I message him back that I will get back to him in an hour because I am out and don't have the phone with me.  I get home, send him that, and he messages back ""ok, its clean, how's the condition of the phone?""  At this point, I'm a little annoyed but still OK, so I repeat what I said in the listing and direct him to look at the pictures.  

So I knew where this was going already.  He responds ""there is a chip on the corner, can I reduce the price by $10?""  I tell him no, he purchased the phone as pictured for $92.  He says cancel the transaction.  I respond with an ""I don't understand,"" and he comes back with ""the phone has a chip, its not as described, cancel this order, unless you can discount $10 for the chip.""

Now, I have reported him to Ebay for trying to get a discount or partial refund after agreeing to purchase an item, and I don't feel like cancelling the order because I want him to get the unpaid item strike.  But should I?  Or should I just cancel the order?  I just have a feeling he does this a lot and would like Ebay to have a note of it, but I'm not sure if it even makes a difference.  Just I can be a jerk too, and don't want to let him off the hook, even though I have no intention of selling it to him anymore.

Ebay,Don't Lie When You Leave Feedback,"I sold and shipped an item that FedEx destroyed. The buyer contacted me when they recieved it and provided pictures. I offered to open a claim through FedEx for them and they happily accepted.  This all happened over the past weekend. I've updated the buyer through every step of the claim process and even provided them with the claim number. We are now just waiting for a response from FedEx.  I have explained to the buyer that no matter what happens, they will either get the item repaired or receive a full refund. The only reason we need to wait a few days is to see how FedEx wants to handle things and who the refund will be sent to.

Today, out of the blue I see that the buyer has left me negative feedback. They stated that the item was broken (true), that it was poor packaging (not true, but subjective I guess), that I was unresponsive (total lie since I've sent them more than 12 messages since this started) and that they had to go to eBay for a refund (complete lie since the buyer hasn't even started a case). I have no idea what prompted the negative this morning or why the buyer made such false claims.

I called eBay and the feedback was removed in about 3 minutes. The rep said it is probably the easiest decision she'll have to make all day.

Moral of the story, be honest in your feedback and don't try to screw people over. While this buyer is still going to get good service from me, I'm not going to go above and beyond like I normally would in a similar situation.


Update: 
I sent the buyer a message asking about negative feedback and when they got eBay involved. The buyer explained that they did leave the feedback by mistake and that it was intended for another seller. They even said they were glad I was able to get it removed because I have been perfectly pleasant, helpful and accommodating. Added at the end that I would have recieved positive feedback for how helpful I've been with this problem.

Ebay,How long should I wait for a reply to a message on a collection only item? (the seller also specifically said in the description that I could arrange for a courier),"**EDIT: Alright, so the person did respond after something like 2 and a half days and we are arranging it all now.**

It's only been a few days but I'm just curious about appropriate times to wait for a response for a collection only order as everything I see mentions a certain time after the estimated delivery date. [Their description said that the buyer could arrange for a courier if they wanted and that it would be easy to arrange/not cost too much.](https://i.imgur.com/t71aMJx.jpg) It's a bass guitar which kind of needs specialist packaging to be completely safe, and I mentioned this in the message in a non-demanding way. The seller's selling history seems to be completely guitar related being mostly guitar pedals and a few actual guitars, so surely they would know they aren't the easiest thing to post. Technically couriers wont cover any damage if the instrument isnt strictly inside a hard shell case but I said to the seller it should be fine if the strings are loosened and it's wrapped in a lot of bubblewrap with the neck being supported properly against snapping and a couple thick cardboard boxes. I'm guessing the seller doesn't have the aformentioned hard shell case which is fine but somewhat risky if it does happen to get damaged. I also said in the message that if they were unable/unwilling to package it properly we could either sort something out or cancel the sale which I said I would rather not do if possible (and I'm sure the seller would rather not also).

I payed via Paypal and then messaged the seller right after asking about dimensions/weight etc for the courier arrangement. I'm guessing they have just forgot to check their emails or something. They seem to be a good seller with 100+ positive feedback and 0 negative, one of which even mentioned ""good communication"".

I'm obviously not ready to send a claim or cancel the paypal payment or anything quite yet but I'm just wondering how long I should wait for a response.",5,14,2019-09-13,EBAY,0.029089508578181267,0.9319252967834473,0.0389852374792099

So I accepted the return and received the DVD back. The DVD isn't damaged or anything like that (although a little dirty from USPS' handling) unless she purposely put microscopic fecal matter, bed bugs, lice or something. It is quite obvious that the buyer did this to get back with me for leaving her a negative feedback when I bought a CD from her. When I got the feedback removed, she probably then returned it to make me lose money (which she did an hour after the feedback was removed).

I was wondering what to do now? I know I have to refund the money back soon. I was wondering if I could get my return shipping money back? BTW, buyer has a listing of the same DVD on her store (she's a ""Top Seller"" with thousands of orders per year) right now.

Edit: Called eBay, the rep was really chill (especially since the DVD I sold was Eminem's 8 Mile and he made a joke about it). Unfortunately, I accidentally  clicked refund, so the system thought the buyer is innocent. But, the rep offered to give me $3 coupon credit even though the return shipping was $2.75. They will pass the case to another division at eBay to investigate the buyer.

Ebay,"With USPS leaving global postage union, cheap sellers (such as Chinese) may be in for a surprise next month","https://www.freightwaves.com/news/us-to-leave-global-postal-union-next-month

&gt;Barring an eleventh-hour agreement, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) will leave the Universal Postal Union (UPU) on October 17, ending 144 years of U.S. involvement in the international body that governs the exchange of mail and postal parcels between countries, and perhaps fundamentally changing the landscape of global air shipping.

and more at the link.  tl;dr some of the cheap shipping rates like ePacket from China have been hurting USPS for some years. When USPS leaves GPU, they are no longer bound to international postage rate and can charge for a lot more to receive and deliver.

The postage rate was set many decades ago, when China and other countries were much less developed and the rate hadn't changed for some 50 years so it is badly out of date with current economics of all the countries within GPU.

I do not know how it would affect eBay sellers but I'd imagine packages sent after October 17 may get rejected by USPS for insufficient postage and leaving many international seller in a bit of quandary.  It is possible sellers caught unaware could lose money or risk getting buried under negs for non-delivery of packages.

I even dedicated the 2nd photo to being just a red text saying “______ is NOT Included....” along with some other details but they still manage to place an order and eventually file a claim for “not as described.” I called eBay about it but all they told me was “it’s probably because ______ was in the title.” So the only way to protect myself from buyers taking advantage of the system is to remove what the item was meant for from the title.

Ebay,Undefined 'Issue' with USPS First Class International Package,"I shipped a package to Germany on 8.22.19 via USPS First Class International. I recently received a message from the buyer asking where their item is. 

(eBay gave the buyer an estimated delivery date of 8.29.19 to 9.25.19, which we are still within obviously.) 

So the first thing I did was track the package. Here is the latest tracking information... 

https://imgur.com/a/jOlhR6B

The last update was on 08.28.19, the package being held in customs in Frankfurt, Germany. The final destination is just outside of Frankfurt. It seems a little odd that it has been in customs for nearly three weeks with no update. 

The tracking history on USPS.com is the same as what eBay shows. The only difference being that eBay says, ""There's an issue with the delivery."" On USPS.com there is no mention of an issue or delay. 
 
I have shipped the same item three to four dozen times over the past year via USPS First Class International and have never had any issues or delays. 

The item cost including shipping was $95 USD. Not exactly an easy loss to take if the package has been lost, as I did not insure it. The item is a Blu-ray movie, a SteelBook to be exact. So I'm confused as to why it could be held in customs for so long unless the package has been lost? 

I assume there is nothing that can be done until 9.26.19, when the estimated delivery date passes...

Ebay,Sales Slump Experiment - It's about the money,"September has been horrible for me.  My sales started slipping in May and have been down since despite having 20% more inventory listed in the same categories vs. the same time last year.   I have sold 9 items in Sept compared to 25 last year and had been in a dry spell for over 5 days without a sale (normally I am selling 1-5 items per day.  

I suspect the GTC has effected me by not getting the monthly sell similar new listing boost along with potential changes to the Cassini search algorithm and posibly the new sales taxes.  Trying to find ways around this I have done the following.

\#1) Ended 1/3 of my listings every 10 days and the relist by the Sell Similar feature to boost them as new listings.  I could not attribute any significant increase to this so I stopped after 60 days.

\#2) Instead of a once a week batch listing, I created dratf and started staggering the listings out over a week with a few new ones in multiple categories each day.  Again I couldn't see any effect or increase in this method after 2 weeks.

\#3) Today I decided to do another experiment.  I pulled up all of my listings for a certain color of a certain item (that I sell in multiple colors) - a total of 9 items,  I applied a promotion rate to the items and sold 2 within the first 2 hours and a 3rd later in the day plus one additional in a different color (that one may be unrelated)

Coincidence?  Hmmm. I'm going to apply it to more listings and see what happens.  

I had been avoiding promoted listings because why should I give Ebay more of my money for not really doing anything more for me?  It's basically just a money grab and I had been selling fine without them.  This is ultimately going to hurt Ebay.  My items are unique, 1 of a kind so if they are getting buried in search (or not showing up at all), then there may not be an alternative for the buyer to purchase which is hurting me and Ebay.  I can't eat that fee increase for promotions so I am going to have to pass it along to the buyer.  If the buyer goes elsewhere, then I have fewer or no sales.

Ebay,Seller didn't refund me postage on a broken item he listed as used and had eBay remove his negative feedback,"Update: 
Seller filed a case against me, eBay upheld my appeal and I got my money back. Seller has migrated his stock to a new account, some of the items have previously sold so either the sale fell through or item was returned. New seller account has lots of neutral but no negative feedback, suggesting the same removal of feedback is going on. 

Summary, came across a bad seller who tried to screw me, eBay sorted it out and he swapped to a new scammy account

Here's the short version:

Seller was selling some pc parts, said ""all accessories and cables included as shown in pictures""

Item arrived, and what I realised was most things were missing and I basically got a paperweight. I didn't know things were missing, because who knows the exact contents of an item before they receive it. Also it was slightly dinged but no night

Seller kicked off when I asked for my money back but I got the return open

He delayed the label, then deliberately sent me one that wasn't going to cover the item

Then on receiving the item he probably kicked it or threw it across the room idk and said it was damaged in transit (I sent it back in the same box it came in, minus the plastic bag over the top)

Somehow he got eBay to remove his negative feedback AND got them to only partially refund me, minus postage both ways!

How can I sort this and how can I stop this guy from doing this to anyone else when he just gets negative removed! His listings all said ""I have these extra rules due to recent buyers...""

I send links containing tutorials and reviews of his exact set up showing that it does work and that there is no compatibility issue.  eBay closes the case. A few days later I receive a “not as described” PayPal claim.  This was my response to the claim: 


September 21, 2019
Note
This transaction was completed on August 25, 2019. The item was shipped and confirmed as delivered. On Wednesday September 18, 2019 the buyer requested a return despite the fact that I had specified no returns in the listing. The buyer claims the item is not compatible with his mobile phone. I researched his supposed issue and provided him with several links containing videos as well as tutorials which show his phone working with the device that he purchased. I also sent the manufacturers specifications which show compatibility. First his reason for the return was, ""Item not working"" and now it has changed to""Item not as described"". Well which one is it? The item in question is an electronic stabilizer with moving parts and motors. How do I know that he did not damage this item in the 20 plus days that it has been in his possession since purchasing it? On our second correspondence the buyer replied, ""unfortunately doesn't work for me. i probably get osmo pocket instead."" So let me get this straight? You purchased an item from me well aware that I do not accept returns, you then proceed to use this item for approximately 23 days before deciding that it just doesn't work for you and now you want to purchase something else? My seller rating on eBay is 100% and I have had an account on eBay since 2009. This is the first time I have ever experienced an issue such as this.

I just received an email stating that PayPal has sided with the buyer and they will be issuing a refund from my account. They also state that they can’t guarantee the condition of the item being returned. What if any recourse do I have in this situation. I feel that I am being totally screwed.

Ebay,"Account hacked, been getting charged by eBay for a year","So I have been dealing with this issue for over a year now, and eBay customer support has not been much help.

I have had my account since 2006, and infrequently sell things (maybe 10 total). Last September my account was hacked by someone in China, who signed me up for a sellers account and listed a bunch of Nintendo Switches for $30. eBay shut down the account very quickly, removed the auctions, canceled the open purchases, and I reset my password/set-up 2 step verification. The hacker had signed me up for a business account, and I cancelled the subscription at that time.

Ever since then, eBay has sent me an invoice for \~$32 a month. Every single month I call the customer support line, and they remove the charges. Every single time they promise that I won't get charged next month, but I always do. I'm at the point now where I am considering shutting down the account, but don't want to lose all the feedback.

Has anyone ever seen this problem before? Is there a way to escalate it up the chain so they can figure out how to stop charging me?

Ebay,I see a lot of sellers who do not understand eBay disputes. You need to call 100% of the time to win.,"Edit: To be clear, in not as described cases.  

Once a dispute is open, the clock starts.  You can put in anything you want, and the buyer the same in messages.  NOBODY will EVER look at them if neither party calls.  It is fully automated.  If the buyer waits the negotiation period out and just clicks online to escalate, they ALWAYS win.  Case closed.  If the buyer calls, the messages may be read but usually you  will lose as well.  It takes a good agent, who actually cares to overturn a buyers case when the buyer calls.

You asthe seller need to call before the buyer escalates.  When the proof of your case is in messages, that is when you call.  When you can prove feedback extortion, buyers remorse, re-shipping or buyer modifications, or item working when shipped, that is when you call.   

If the buyer never responds to your messages, you are probably screwed, sorry.  You need to get a response.",34,58,2019-09-23,EBAY,0.10739585012197495,0.8687813878059387,0.023822790011763573

Ebay,Looking for advice before shipping item to buyer,"First off, I'm located in the United States. Last night  I sold a computer part for around $400. The buyer has 0 feedback and just created his account the same day. I don't usually let that bother me, but some other things seem off and I'm wondering the best way to proceed. Before I noticed some of the quirks, I replied to his message asking about tracking, asking him to confirm his address and if he wanted a signature required at delivery. I have not heard back from him yet.

As I looked further into the transaction details, I noticed his PayPal first/last name is different from his eBay first/last name, one English the other Chinese; not a big deal I suppose. The concerning thing is about his shipping address - it's some unmarked industrial complex. A few Google searches on the address show a couple of posts regarding the address **right next door** being a scam if they buy an item from you on eBay/Amazon.

I'm not thrilled about the possibility of losing $400 if a problem comes up and eBay somehow sides with the buyer (seems to be a theme around here).

Ebay,UK eBay - Question about VAT invoice request?,"Short version, sold a piece of audio equipment yesterday and shipped this morning.

Have just received a message from the buyer saying it's 'for a business so they need a VAT invoice if possible'.

My question is, I'm not a business (I'm a private seller) so does that mean I can't make one? Or do I find a template and follow the dots so to speak (or does doing that get me in trouble because I'm not VAT registered and/or a business)? The request has confused me... but I like to be as helpful as possible.

Anyone have any suggestions?

I have been on Ebay since the early 2000’s, and believe it is a very unique platform that gives their seller lots of freedoms other platforms do not.  Yet, I feel they have definitely been slipping as of late. Especially attempting to be the next Amazon. When in the past they were doing just fine being their own unique platform. Ebay needs to learn that sometimes it is okay to be second.

In terms of what I've said to them and heard back from:

Me:  Hi, Thank you for sending the item promptly. I was disappointed to find there is a big dent on the cap that wasn't described in the listing or shown in any of the photo s. If this had been described or shown I wouldn't have bid on the pen. 

Them:  Pen was sold as spare repair untested and no returns read description 

Me:  You didn't state; there was damage or you didn't say spares or repairs in the listing or show there was damage so I'd like to return the pen.

Them:  Can you read the description can you see the pictures I’m sure you can

I know Ebay will side in my favour but can I phone them up to deal with it sooner?

Ebay,Why does ebay let you set your set your acct to “no returns” if there is really no way to deny a buyers request for a return?,I sold a bundle of used sporting items. Specified in my post “I have not tested these items. Please refer to the pictures I have provided as to the condition these items are in”. 2 days after it had arrived and I’d got my money in my paypal acct I get a “Return request” and the money that was in my account (that I needed) got put back on hold. Why is it that even if I specifically made my post clear to avoid this problem and have my account set to “no returns” I am forced to take a return no questions asked or even a review of my post to decide if the buyer is making a false claim? The buyer messaged ebay and said “he sold me a pile a of junk and knew it” and thats all it takes for them to take money out of my account and possibly also take money from my now negative paypal account to make me pay for him to ship my items back to me? 2 larger shipping payments worth the cash down the drain just to get my item back for a single return request really just discouraged me from feeling like this is worth doing. Ebay displays and recommends options for sellers that do not actually exist and you click them and they take you back to the help page you started on. when you call them they refer you to the same rules and the lady literally said “I do not know why it says you can deny the return if you cant”. ebay automatically sides with their buyers rather than sellers and so far this has all been so much more trouble than its worth.,30,54,2019-09-27,EBAY,0.09143909066915512,0.8773181438446045,0.031242744997143745
Ebay,Lowest Price Issue,"I Know, im about to be the 5 billionth person to have mentioned this, but something needs to be done, as its been going on for more than 5 years now, and ebay has done nothing?

# What exactly is the ""Lowest Price Issue""?

It's when a seller lists something with a high price, but in an attempt to come up in the ""lowest price"" listings, they put one or two irrelevant products with a low price (some even going as far as making something that says ""out of stock"") to make it seem like its cheap. You have literally not used this site yet if you have never come across this before.

# Why is it annoying?

because you use the lowest price feature to find the lowet price, not to find mumbled garbage which has one rubbish item on it that is low priced.

This has been abused on ebay to the point where it comes up on literally anything you are looking for, and I have to say its bloody annoying now.

Ebay,Warning to new sellers,"I made my first sale a few days ago, and the following day my Ebay account was suspended for ""suspicious activity"".  I had no idea why this happened, since I had already shipped the item, my account was linked to Paypal, and everything seemed smooth

After calling a rep, apparently the account suspension was part of a verification method.  The email was very unclear about this, and made it seem like it was something I did wrong.  The rep also told me i'm not the first to be confused by the whole process and they are ""fixing it""

So yea, if you recently made your first sale, this might happen to you.  You have to call them to fix it, and you can't actually get the support number on their website due to your account being suspended.  It also won't list the number in the email.  I had to google it, its 1 (866) 540-3229

Ebay,What can one do if you sell an item and get it returned because it was “broken”?

Ebay,Cannot Pay for Item Due to Seller Error - Best Way to Resolve?,"Won an auction for an item. Went to pay immediately and got the ""One or more sellers can't accept payments right now. Contact the sellers for help."" Contacted the seller who is saying there is nothing he/she can do about it (something about the original Paypal account being nonexistent and there being nothing they can do about it) and to pay them directly through Paypal. He/she is being insistent saying that it is buyer protected (I know that it is not). Thanks to google, Ebay forums, and reddit I know that giving the money directly is 100% not the right thing to do. I explained that it's against Ebay policy, but the explanation fell to deaf ears.

&amp;nbsp;

So how do I resolve this? I don't want an unpaid item strike (which I know the seller can open a case within 2 days), and I would prefer getting the item, but at this point, I'm resigned that it won't happen. I tried opening a case, but I think as a buyer, you have to wait 7 days or something until you can do this. I'm also peeved enough that I don't want to simply cancel the order to ensure that other people do not go through this same ordeal (IE. Want to make sure the seller fulfills their end of the bargain and/or gets a black mark if this is an intentional scam).

&amp;nbsp;

Anyone else have experience with this?

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: I called Ebay as I couldn't open the case and the CSR was extremely helpful. They confirmed that you shouldn't pay directly outside Ebay. They also took a look at my message history and saw that I had informed the seller of this much. Interestingly, they did hint that what the seller was experiencing was true: that if you have an ""old"" account (not sure if it's Ebay/Paypal), Ebay won't let you send money to that account. They also indicated that you can't get an unpaid strike if you can't actually pay, so not to worry about that (and she added documentation to the record). Their recommendation was either have the seller relist the item under the correct paypal email address or to have the seller cancel the order. Obviously, I'm assuming the seller doesn't give a crap, so I asked them to cancel.",5,2,2019-09-29,EBAY,0.17289768159389496,0.8029913306236267,0.024111026898026466

Ebay,"Buyer requesting refund because I didn't supply the box for an item, despite it never being mentioned in the advert. How do I go forward?","Hello all, 

Last week I sold a fountain pen on eBay - I have been trying to get rid of this for ages. It usually sells for around £800-1000 but I sold it for £600, before being stung by fees etc. 

The item arrived with the buyer today and they messaged me, telling me that they aren't happy with the product. This is because it doesn't come with the box and papers stating that it is ""standard practice for collectible pens"" and if ""box/papers aren't supplied, this will be noted explicitly in the listing"". I have a large collection of fountain pens, many of them bought on eBay, and it's never guaranteed whether the box is supplied or if it's even listed - I don't think there's legitimate ground for the buyer's claim regarding the explicit listing in the advert. AFAIK there's no ""pen selling law"" where you **have** to state whether the box is supplied.

He then goes on to explain that without the box, the item ""isn't worth £600"", which is of course subjective and says that my listing is misleading because ""these pens are very much available in the UK...for £640"" I stated in the advert that they're not sold in the UK. As far as I was aware, this was true at the time the advert was placed, but digging around there are two retailers that sell the pen. The pen I was selling has a rose gold trim and a stub nib, which adds to the rarity of the pen, hence the claim in the advert. 

Before I respond to him, I want to see where I should go. He hasn't officially opened a case against me or anything like that, only messaged me. I could source a box for him as I have a friend who will most likely have some. I do think his claims are a bit wild, given the context, but I know that eBay has a bit of a reputation for screwing over sellers and usually siding with the buyers in silly cases. 

Many thanks.
