Ebay,How do I block morons from my auctions?!?!?,"This is sooo frustrating.
This is the second time now that some idiot from Indonesia is trying to buy an item from me.  CLEARLY states on my auction - that I DO NOT SHIP outside of the united states.  Why does ebay let these morons with registered addresses outside of the US even bid on stuff if the auction is listed as ""ships to: US Only""????  Now my auction has ended early, and I have to wait 7 days for my cancellation request to be answered... furthermore... ebay states that:
""If the buyer declines to cancel the transaction, this case will be automatically closed and you will not receive a Final Value Fee credit.""
WTF????  If the moron does pay me, I will simply refund his payment because he's a moron.  But then I will have to go back to ebay and request a FVF credit... ARGHHGHG",11,7,2011-09-02,EBAY,0.22523437440395355,0.7499289512634277,0.024836691096425056
Ebay,A bit worried about legal action.,"So, I sold an item on eBay (and I'm not so experienced with selling) and some guy won the item. I waited a day and got no payment, and noticed  eBay has a second chance offer option. I thought, great, lemme use that. Didn't realize I should try to cancel the transaction first. Long story short, sold it to someone else, first guy pays a day later, I refund him and explain its sold, a few emails go back and forth where he's flipping out, and now hes threatening to contact the police. (and although he hasnt said it im worried about a lawsuit.) The item was won for about 5 bucks and is probably worth somewhere between 50-120 bucks (its a pretty hideous piece of jewlery).

Ebay,"Buyer Wants to Return, Help Me On My First Time","I sent a piece of older audio recording equipment to someone across the country.

What's the process?  How do I go about a refund?  I believe I listed as-is in the description, but I can understand them not wanting it with the damage (cosmetic, but still rough).

Ebay,"Made a mistake as a buyer, what should I do?","I bought an item that I need for an event in a few weeks last night, but forgot that I had a ""best offer"" out on an item that is similar to the one I need. Unfortunately, that would mean I have two of almost the same thing. The other problem is the second item, the one where the buyer accepted the ""best offer"" price would arrive a whole month after when I need it. It was probably my fault for not checking the shipping policy, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pay for a completely useless item. 

I did contact the seller and explain my issue, that it wouldn't arrive on time, and asked them if they could cancel the transaction. If they don't cancel the transaction, what should I do? I'm not sure I want to pay for it, I don't want two of the same thing. I realize I made a mistake and sound like an idiot but I'm hoping that I can resolve this with the seller and they'll be understanding. Maybe if it does go through I can sell it on Ebay myself, but I'm not sure. I would appreciate any advice.

**Update 9/11:** The seller said they would cancel it, but they had been charged a $3 listing fee. They said they would complete the transaction if I left positive feedback. What should I do?",8,0,2011-09-10,EBAY,0.08210903406143188,0.815690279006958,0.10220067203044891
Ebay,What's your experience like with submitting a non-payment ticket to the resolution center as a seller?,"I have sent 3 emails and an invoice for an item whose auction was completed on September 7th. I specified that if I hadn't gotten an email at the least by the end of today, I would have to take action. I've not received any acknowledgement of my emails (that I sent through eBay).

I hate to have to take action, but if this isn't going to pan out, I'd like to relist it (as anyone would).

The oddest thing is that the buyer submitted their final bid only a few minutes before the item ended (and I am sure it's not an automatic bid because it's the only bid on the item).

Anyway, what kind of experience have you had? What kinds of procedures happened to you that are different from what is listed at eBay?",4,1,2011-09-14,EBAY,0.06679452210664749,0.906619131565094,0.02658630535006523

Ebay,Buyer claims item is defective,"I sold a washing machine attachment recently on ebay. The buyer received it, and claims that he hooked it up and it was leaking. 

I had purchased these at an auction, not from the OEM, but the boxes were still sealed with box staples and tape. I never opened the boxes. I installed one myself, and the fittings are plastic. The first one I installed, I think I cracked it, as it leaked very similar to how the buyer is claiming his is leaking. 

My question is, will I have any recourse if/when he files a claim for refund? Am I obligated to offer a refund? I did list the item as new, was this a mistake?

EDIT:

Here is the correspondence so far. I have dealt with a few situations like this, but only on smaller, cheaper items. Any advice on how to respond would be appreciated.

HIM:

Hello, I got the (item) and it is broken inside. There is any way to get another one instead of this unit?
I owned (an item) for 5 years and I am pleased with the product but this is a bad unit.
thanks

ME:

It is unfortunate that you unit is broken. All units were visually inspected before shipping. Was the unit damaged during shipping? What exactly is broken on the unit?

HIM: 

I purchased this unit because mine quit working. I hanged the unit on present metal hanger, I used two wrenches one to hold above, one to tighten the hose nut and when I turned the unit on, light came one OK, flow of bubbling water thru central tube OK but it started to leak water pretty badly on the lower right side. You can not assume that I broke something while attaching hoses, because I know the drill: you hold above with a pair of pliers or wrench, then tighten gently hose to the nipple. It seems it leeks water from the valve area. No, box does not have visible sign of damage but who knows, something is broken inside.
Please advise. 

I didn't think I accused him of anything, but he seemed rather defensive. 

So where do I go from here? Do I ask him to ship it back on his dime? Don't think he will go for it, but I have been successful once before, on a much smaller item. It costs me about $30 to ship this one, and I am pretty sure I won't be able to resell it once I receive it.

Just tell him to keep it, and ask for a transaction cancellation in exchange for a refund?",11,2,2011-09-20,EBAY,0.21271897852420807,0.7452377080917358,0.04204332455992699

Ebay,Had an item not as described claim opened against me...,"I've actually posted to /r/ebay about this buyer before, but this is just getting me angry. It's a long read, but some people say I'm a great writer so you'll be entertained. (there is a tl;dr below though!)

I was even going to post a few days ago feeling that this was going to happen... but decided against it to see if she would respond.

Here are the things you need to know:
The item is a lab manual, relatively cheaply sold, and it's a hybrid between two manuals. We'll call the two manuals cover and addendum--cover because the cover depicts that manual's face and addendum because it seems parts of cover's manual have been removed to put some part of addendum. It's pretty common in hybrid college books, so I made sure to mention exactly what college I used it in and for what class. I documented the picture well and it's clear enough to read easily.

I also made sure to outline the two titles in this one item within the description. I had no problem whatsoever responding to questions about content and made that abundantly clear in the description, and to ask any questions before purchasing or bidding on the item to prevent something just like this.

So, earlier this month (September 7th) it looks like the item isn't going to sell. It was about 13 minutes left into the listing and there had only been enough views on it to count on a hand or two and only one watcher. I was ready to relist until I got a surprise last minute bid.

Turns out it wasn't a good thing. I immediately sent an invoice in order to facilitate payment so I could ship the item the next day with another one I had going out. The next day comes, no response to the invoice. So I sent a message asking if there was anything wrong and to send payment by September 11th midnight to prevent any further delay in shipping and to respond to the message to acknowledge receipt. I received nothing from her. Sent a message of the same calibur early morning hours September 12th and I decided to be a little more lenient. I didn't outright say I would open a nonpayment claim, but I continued to inquire about why she had not responded to my messages. I sent another final message on the 13th informing her that I was going ahead with the claim and to still message me back with details on why payment had not been completed.

Fast forward to September 17th, the nonpayment claim had been open for a few days now, and I'd seemingly forgotten about it until I received an instant payment to Paypal. She even opted to pay extra for expedited shipping, so I made the effort to ship the next day. It gets to her on September 20th. I haven't left her feedback yet, nor has she left me any.

The night of the 20th I get a message. Something short like ""thanks for your patience with payment, but the book has chapters missing and that it wasn't disclosed.""

I responded immediately. I quoted directly from the description of my item and wrote a well detailed response from My eBay explaining that I didn't accept returns, but also that there should be no reason to because I never held any information back. So, do you think I received a response? Nope!

This morning I wake up to a claim-- and in the message she claims to never have gotten a response to her one email in all of two weeks. This leads me to believe she is not getting her eBay mail... terrific.

Now I have my first claim opened against me and I don't know how these things usually go. I don't feel inclined to give her a refund and I sure as hell am not eating the expedited shipping cost.

Need advice, stories, whatever you guys can give.
