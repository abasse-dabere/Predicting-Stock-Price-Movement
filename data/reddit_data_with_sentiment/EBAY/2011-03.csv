Ebay,Ebay buyer wants me to lie on amount item is worth,"Their message:

""Hello, I'm a Sega fan from Italy and I'm interested to bid on your Game. Unfortunately I have a little problem with italian Custom, they taxes every order above 30,00 USD. Please if I win the auction is it a problem for you to declare on Custom Form just 30,00 USD?
I hope isn't a problem for you""

What do you guys think I should do? This is the first time I've tried selling something worldwide. Is there some way they can scam me or something?

Input would be super :)

Edit: I'd like to add that it's not a game I'm selling but a vinyl record that came with the xbox dreamcast collection in Australia. I don't know why he refers to it as a game.",13,3,2011-03-02,EBAY,0.02172061800956726,0.9027877449989319,0.07549159973859787

Ebay,"Seller told me before purchasing that I would not have to pay shipping to send it back, now (after purchase) they are telling me I will have to pay return shipping. What can I do?","I was looking for a cheap battery for a phone. I had previously tried buying one off ebay but, despite being the exact model number I needed, it did not fit. That seller refunded my money 100% and did not even ask me to return it (since he had other, similar complaints). 

A few months later I decide I will give it another go and found another seller listing a battery for my phone make &amp; model. Given what happened with the last one, I emailed the seller beforehand with my concerns and specifically asked whether I would be refunded if it did not fit and whether I would have to pay return shipping. They said that they would refund the money and I would not have to pay return shipping. 

So I bought the battery, received it, and as feared, it did not fit. I contacted the seller and asked them to confirm once again I would not be charged to ship it back. Now they are saying that I will have to pay to ship it back (and that it beats paying a 15% re-stocking fee &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; ). I have let them know I do not appreciate being lied to just to make a sale. I've never had a real problem with an eBay seller before so I'm not sure what the next step to take would be... Our messages before &amp; after the sale were through eBay so there is a record of them. What would you guys suggest I do from here? Keep at the seller, go to eBay?

Ebay,succesful? scam on ebay,"Hi there I was wondering if anybody has experienced this. Three months ago I sold an item on ebay and it was settled properly via paypal, I gave positive feedback and everything was ok until last month when I was informed by paypal that the buyer was challenging the transaction. I gave paypal copy of the feedback the buyer left for me on ebay (positive) but paypal nevertheless cancelled the transaction, lost my money and now the buyer has positive scores everywhere and I sent an Item which was not paid for.
On top of it customer service in ebay is just not being helpful at all and I can't challenge this via paypal.
Has anybody else experienced this?",7,3,2011-03-11,EBAY,0.09160205721855164,0.8363387584686279,0.0720592588186264

Ebay,Reddit I need your help!!  I think I may have just been scammed on ebay...,"I'm a fairly new ebayer. I just sold a [$30 Target Gift Card](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=270718518303&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MESOX:IT#ht_500wt_1156) on eBay. The first weird that that happened is the winner bid $30.97 (which is more than the value of the actual card iteslf). I was pretty excited at this, seeing as I made extra money. I proceeded to ship this item in an envelop to the buyer's house. Two days later, I got a message saying that she did not receive the card, but rather got a ripped envelope and a bag. She sent me pictures of the envelope and the bag ([Envelope](i.imgur.com/pu4xp.png)  &amp; [Bag](http://i.imgur.com/knRpg.jpg) ). That is in fact my envelope, but I dont know where the bag came from.
My questions are: is this normal for eBay? Does this happen often? Is that a standard bag from a post office if they lose a package? I currently have the $30 that she paid on hold in my payapl, what is my next move? She seems extremely nice, I cannot tell if she is scamming me. What do I do!?!?
Please Help! I know this is not a lot of money but I need it!",9,2,2011-03-24,EBAY,0.027373960241675377,0.9286696314811707,0.04395633935928345
