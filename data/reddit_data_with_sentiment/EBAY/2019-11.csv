Ebay,Do you have problems with buyers that ask for discount upfront?,"I am curious if others have experienced this and if so approximately what percentage of sales. I'm referring to buyers that send you a message asking for a discount on an item that is BIN but doesn't have make an offer (I never use it). In my experience I would say it is about 40% of the time once I turn them down and they buy the item at my BIN they say there is something wrong with the item trying to get a partial refund. 

I generally tend to list things at the amount I am looking to get once PP/Ebay fees are factored in, I'm not a professional seller or anything, just selling in a more niche market of collectables as a way to fund to add or remove from my personal collection.

It was set to ""calculate shipping"", and it varied between $15 for people close by, to about $60 shipping for across the country. Somehow, someone across the country bought it and the sale said that he paid 0 and that I would foot the shipping ($48). Ebay and this person thought I would sell my $70 dollar item (typical price on craigslits etc), for $2 profit. I never changed it to ""I will pay the shipping"". Further proof, when I cancelled the transaction, and refunded, Ebay said ""would you like to relist?"" and after clicking yes, it relists it with ""buyer will pay between 15-60 depending on location"".

Ebay,New and only time seller - feeling screwed,"So, like title says, i’m a new and one-time seller. I’m in the middle of a move, having to get rid of a good chunk of my vinyl/cassette collection to open up space. Now, i’m going to semi-preface this by saying that I am *well* aware that a lot/all of this situation is my own fault for not doing enough research and not communicating properly. 

First off, I had no idea that eBay puts a hold on new sellers funds. It makes sense, but it’s frustrating, at the very least that they won’t release the money allotted for shipping. They have my bank account information for christsake. Regardless, I should have researched. So I sold around 110 items, which is quite a bit more than I anticipated, and I very quickly became swamped. Again, I realize the burden is on **me**, no one else. Shipping becomes delayed mostly because of the financial reason, and messages start pouring in, I respond to all but (apparently) one message, all the while using the **very, very** *very* shitty mobile app. I don’t have access to a computer very often. The message from the buyer I missed ended up with that person (understandably) filing a claim, and eBay deservedly awarding them a refund. The decision came this afternoon at 5pm. Around 4:40pm, I updated the status of the auction to ‘shipped’. I wasn’t able to plug in tracking until around 6:30pm. My dilemma, as it stands, is that the buyer has now received a full refund, and on Tuesday will be receiving a rather expensive record in the mail. eBay support essentially tells me I am at the mercy of the buyer, if they don’t refuse the delivery I essentially was given a shrug over the phone. 

Does anybody have any advice or has this happened to you? I have already messaged the buyer and apologized, asked them to refuse the delivery, or if they would like to keep it, to paypal me direct an amount less than the finalized price. I don’t know what else I could do. Can the post office stop the item in transit? 

I appreciate any help, and like I have said with painstaking regularity - I understand I could have prevented this myself, I made some mistakes and hopefully will not be completed screwed because of it.",9,4,2019-11-01,EBAY,0.09185052663087845,0.8806247115135193,0.027524763718247414
Ebay,"My buyer wants me to ship to a mail forwarding &amp; packaging service, (which I'm assuming will forward it to another country) is this in any way putting me in danger?","This is my first time selling and wanted to be sure.

The shipping address includes his personal name, and the address shows up on Google Maps as ""Qwintry.com - Mail Forwarding and Packaging service"" in Delaware, United States. However the buyer's location is marked as ""Russian Federation"". So obviously he will not personally be present to pick up the item. He has never sold an item but has 400 karma and zero negative reviews from dozens of purchases. (he has also never left a negative review for a seller)

I was wondering, as long as I require signature and the item successfully makes it to ""Qwintry"", does that mean I've done my part? I do have the item marked for 30 day returns, but what would I do if he did try to return? He's in Russia. 

Some more info: the item is a smartphone, was marked as Buy it Now, no best offer options, and I currently have the $280 ""on hold"" in my paypal account.

Ebay,Sold a laptop 22 days ago with no returns policy. Now asking for return for fan noise.,"Hi guys,

I have a feeling I'm pretty screwed here and I'm just gonna have to take it as a lesson but I wanted to double check for some advice.

I sold a laptop 22 days ago and the customer was happy. He has now put through a return as the laptop is not working or defective. He mentions a few things but mainly it is small regular laptop things such as fan noise and hard to press power button.

I am very aware that in 22 days he could have stripped many parts out of this laptop, some any manner of things to it and then still return it and get me to pay for everything. Is there any recourse available?

Ebay,Seller asks PayPal address for partial refund,"Hello, in my first purchase on eBay (some audio equipment) the seller offered two different shipping options in his listing, I chose the most expensive option to avoid the other company which I’ve had trouble with in the past. 

The seller end up sending the items by the cheaper company anyway without telling me anything. Since there was a significant cost difference between the two (more than 20 dollars) I contacted the seller to know what happened and ask if he could provide me a partial refund for the amount of shipping difference.

He didn’t offer any explanation and just asked me for my paypal address which I find strange, from what I’ve read he should be able to issue a partial refund directly from my eBay order shouldn’t he?

Ebay,My First Negative,"So, We've had our part-time seller account since September 2018, under our LLC name. In that time, we've sold over 200 listings and made over $14,000. Of those 200+ transactions, we've received 67 positive feedback (a 33.5% feedback per transaction rate) full of comments about quality/condition and top-notch customer service. That's not to say we've never had an upset buyer before now, but we've handled each case politely and professionally, often going above and beyond what is required of us. Now, this single neg has dropped our 100% positive rating to 98.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

We sell a wide variety of items, but our main sellers are pre-owned and vintage shoes. Anyone who collects old sneakers will tell you that sometimes they fall apart - and that it's no one's fault. Old shoes simply degrade over time. This happened once on a pair of vintage ACGs a few months back - the foam midsole disintegrated after a weekend of heavy wear, causing the sole to completely separate from the shoe. Our buyer was familiar with the repair process and didn't expect anything from us, but advised us to add a disclaimer about vintage shoes to our other listings, so we gave him a partial refund as thanks, to help with the repair cost.

&amp;#x200B;

We immediately added our new disclaimer to our oldest shoes, and have since made it a part of our listing template just to cover our asses in the future. It now appears just below the item description in an \*unmissable\* black box with a bright red border.

&gt;**DISCLAIMER:**  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Older and vintage shoes may not stand up to wear like a brand new pair. Even an unworn shoe may show age-related breakdown of components such as adhesive and foam midsoles.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*Wear at your own risk!*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\[REDACTED COMPANY NAME\] recommends seeking out a shoe repair specialist to resole vintage shoes prior to use or at the first sign of wear to minimize potential damage or injury. 

Unfortunately, we hadn't added it to \*all\* of our prior listings - including the Ladies' Gucci sneakers that got this latest feedback, so when we received the first post-sale message from the buyer, I had to do my best to explain the concept of older shoes often needing repair.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Hello  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I wore my shoes this weekend and as I propped my feet up I noticed a tear in the shoe that was not mentioned in the description. I like the shoe by would not have bought if they were torn in the seam - while this location is not easy to see I know with regular wear it will grow larger . Any suggestions? 

\[ME @ Oct 21 4:03 PM PST\]

&gt; Thank you for messaging us with your concern. I'm glad you like the shoes (I might have kept them for myself if they were a size smaller), and I apologize for the unmentioned damage.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;While we did not notice any significant damage prior to listing - we are careful to list any major flaws that could go unnoticed - it appears there was a minor fray on the left side of the right shoe visible in the photographs. We encourage all buyers to carefully view photographs for condition prior to purchase as we are aware me may overlook small details in the listing process.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the best ways to prevent a fray from moving further into the fabric (as I believe these are canvas uppers), is a light application of Liquid Stitch (or a similar product). The glue stops frays (can even make them less noticeable), dries clear and can stand up to machine washing without the need for reapplication.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;If further wear puts too much stress on the adhesive binding the outsole to the upper (where the fray appears to have started), a few drops of an adhesive like Shoe Goo should hold as well as (or often better than) the remaining original components.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;We us both Liquid Stitch and Shoe Goo in our basic shoe repair kit for many of our vintage finds that are in less-than-perfect condition. Had we noticed the fray beforehand, I would have applied this fix prior to listing.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Alternatively, you could seek out a shoe repair specialist, as the professional repair should be relatively inexpensive (around $20-30 in most cases).  
  
&gt;  
&gt;As you've already mentioned, regular wear is likely to cause further damage, so I recommend limiting wear-time until it's been repaired.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Chelsea 

\[BUYER @ Oct 21 10:24 PM PST\]

&gt; Well be glad you didn’t keep them because they are ruined - someone had to have glued them together or something because as I was walking out of the airport the sole started flopping around and the support piece inside fell out - so they can not be fixed and I am. Is requesting a full refund 

\[ME @ Oct 22 5:16 AM PST\]

&gt; I'm sorry for the inconvenience. That's a common occurrence in older shoes as the original adhesive wears away over time, but sole separation is easily repaired.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I've located a shoe repair specialist near you that charges reasonable repair rates. You can view their website at \[REDACTED\]  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Your $125 discount off our BIN price should more than cover any repair cost.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I highly recommend re-reading ebay's return/refund policies, as we adhere to the strictest rules on condition. Because your shoes arrived as described, and only started to fall apart after 4 days of what one could assume was heavy wear (the airport isn't exactly a vacation for your feet), we would require a return and deduction from your refund for the cost of repairs. If they are indeed irreparable as you say, then we will be unable to issue a refund.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have any other questions, please either let me know or contact ebay customer service for more details. 

\[BUYER @ Oct 22 6:26 AM PST\]

&gt; I will check the policy and you have no idea what my trip to the airport was like and I do not believe any reasonable person would say that this was normal and that I walked too much- and my discount was not a discount , the shoes are older and falling apart- they “ appeared “ to be nice however this could’ be seen as deceptive depending on how you look at it . From what you are telling me is I am SOL - 

\[ME @ Oct 22 7:42 AM PST\]

&gt; I apologize for delays in response as I am currently at work.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I do not claim to know what your trip was like, only that walking around an airport tends to put more mileage on a pair of shoes than an otherwise average day of wear. Your continued use of the shoes prior to repair went against my recommendation to have them repaired first - you pointed out yourself that it would likely cause further damage.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I did say that sole separation was ""common"" in older shoes, but not ""normal"". As shoes age, worn or not, adhesive compounds begin to degrade and often need reapplication. A professional would be able to explain the process.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;We did provide a discount - $125 off a $250 pair of shoes - because it was an older listing. It was not a condition discount as we noticed no issues prior to shipping. There was no intended deception, nor do we imply that older or vintage shoes are suitable for everyday wear. Our updated listings reflect this with a recommendation to have vintage shoes inspected and repaired by a professional at the first sign of wear.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**You are free to return the shoes**, however we will be required to deduct from your refund for any damage caused by wearing the shoes - in line with ebay return policy.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Alternatively, you could visit the repair specialist I mentioned previously for an affordable solution. 

\[BUYER @ Oct 22 11:57 AM PST\]

&gt; Just a FYI I made you aware of the fray the same day that the sole came off- a few hours Of wear so your recommendation could not be followed up upon as it was the same day. Not sure if any shoe that falls apart that quickly and then be told it was basically my fault because I wore them and decided to wear them . Not aware that they were a museum piece and only for admiring . I will follow up with eBay 

\[FEEDBACK LEFT @ Nov 2\]

&gt; Shoes tore up after wearing one day - seller not helpful at all - 

\[FEEDBACK RESPONSE LEFT @ Nov 2 1:35 PM PST\]

&gt; Offered repair and return options, buyer refused all help, expected full refund. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called eBay this afternoon, and while the rep agreed with me that the feedback was undeserved, she claimed (after deliberating with her team) that the feedback contained no violation and she would be unable to remove it. I let her know I understood the reasoning, but that I would still like to speak to a supervisor to see if they could do anything else. Unfortunately, after around 20 minutes or so of a back-and-forth of ""I'm sorry, all of my supervisors are still busy on other calls"" and another hold, I finally had to schedule a call back. If they wind up forgetting about me (likely) I'll just keep trying until I reach someone who can actually do something about it. Might try eBay for Business on Facebook.

&amp;#x200B;

I can almost guarantee the buyer threw away the broken shoes expecting a full refund without needing to return them, because she never tried to open a case or return, through either eBay or PayPal, and did nothing but leave feedback 11 days after saying she would contact eBay. This $250 listing ($125 offer accepted) included free shipping and free 30-day returns, so the buyer would have lost nothing but our low repair cost deducted from her refund (as I mentioned to her, it would likely be an inexpensive repair).

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note, I did leave a feedback response (above), but noticed that the app has no way to display responses. At all. Since many eBay buyers shop through the app, my response is unlikely to be seen, while the neg is planted firmly there for all to see. Of all the app flaws (there are tons of ways the app is screwed up where the desktop version works), this one upsets me the most. Even the ""hidden"" listing description can be expanded on mobile, but feedback responses don't even show up.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Buyer left negative feedback because she wanted a full refund without having to return the shoes, even though we offered both repair and return information. Called eBay and couldn't get the neg removed because ""there was no violation"". Planning on calling back until I get a rep who can/will remove it, because ""seller not helpful at all"" is a dishonest statement, since I (as the rep stated) ""went above and beyond to provide options"". As per eBay policy:

&gt; If you decide to leave negative feedback, make sure it's ***fair, factual***, and relates specifically to your transaction with the seller. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think? Is this feedback deserved? Is it a violation of feedback policy or an ""opinion"" about the buyer experience? Should eBay remove it?

Ebay,Just got told off by seller for paying strait away!?,"I don't get it, don't people want to be paid soon after an auction ends?

I usually bid on a lot of items and don't pay attention to the sellers ID. So I inadvertently bid on a few items from the same seller and paid as soon as the auctions ended (which I usually do). Then I get an email 'Stop paying for everything strait away, pay when everything has ended!. 

Is this common? should I just wait until all auctions have ended to avoid this happening again?

Edit_

The seller had free shipping on the listings.

I usually message sellers before buying multiple listings if they are paid for postage and do wait to see if they combine shipping.

The ones that have free shipping I don't pay attention to their user ID.

Edit_

does anyone know if paying separately for each sale will give the seller more feedback points?

Ebay,My First Negative - REMOVED,"It only took about 5 phone calls, but once I finally got an American rep on the line (around 6 pm eastern), he noted that we were a Top-Rated Power-Seller account. and actually took us seriously. He took one look at our feedback history (all glowing reviews) and said about the negative, ""that's clearly wrong."" He got two messages into my back and forth with the customer and said ""It's clear that you tried to help - a lot more than other sellers would."" He finished reading the messages, and said ""I've \*never\* seen a seller do as much as you have to handle a customer complaint."" He made a subtle dig at the unscrupulous side of the seller base, another at buyers who don't read descriptions, and praised our customer service skills. Then, he told us that since a supervisor had previously denied the request, he wouldn't be able to override that decision, but after a \*very\* brief discussion with his own team, he came back on the line with the good news. ""I was able to process the removal of the negative feedback."" He said it could take up to 48 hours, but when we refreshed the screen a few hours later, it was already gone.

I explain why I don't use commas between the title keywords (awkward to read, takes up valuable space, etc).

Well, he basically blew up at me when I explained that I wasn't going to put commas between my keywords!

Is there a reason why a seller would want to do this? I'm curious as to why they would pick refunding me quite a bit instead of exchanging the item? Does eBay penalise sellers that much??

Ebay,Buyer returning damaged iPhone weeks after receiving it,"Hi everyone. This post will be a little long but I would really appreciate some advice. 

I sold an iPhone 7 back in September after I upgraded to an 11. My old phone was pretty much immaculate and it was locked to xfinity mobile. A buyer asked me if it was locked and I responded yes. The buyer then made the purchase and as soon as she received the phone she messaged me asking to unlock it... ugh.

I try to be understanding so I went through the whole shebang with my carrier and Apple to get the phone unlocked. Buyer thanks me and leaves me positive feedback.

Anyways, about 3 weeks later the buyer messaged me saying she “gave the phone to a friend and it won’t work” and then claims the SIM card slot won’t go in all the way. I am 100% sure it was fine when I sent it out and I’m almost positive she had to have messed it up somehow when her (or her friend) were swapping SIM cards multiple times.

Since she claimed the item was damaged I had to accept the return. So I get the phone back today and sure enough the SIM card slot is sticking out like .5 mm and won’t seat all the way.

I checked the buyer account and turns out she has multiple (2) negative feedback out of 17 lifetime feedback over the past month from returning broken iPhones. 

The eBay return overview page gives me the option to report the returned item as damaged but is still says to give a refund or it will automatically be taken after 2 days. Now I’m out my sale $ and my phone has lost its value from being broken.

In the pictures on the original sale post it’s hard to tell from the lighting and angles, but there is NO signs of the sim slot sticking out. 

Do I have any hope here or do I just give up and count it as a loss? 

Thanks so much for any help.

Update: Called ebay and they basically said there is nothing I can do because buyer has full protection. I even have photos from the listing that show my carrier information at the top of the screen proving the sim card worked before I sent it. AND forgot to mention the buyer put a note in the box saying ""Sorry one of my children threw away the phone case you originally included"" and put a very low quality case as a replacement. Ebay still said there is nothing I can do. This makes no sense to me and I'll probably hold off from selling on ebay in the future.

Update 2

Ebay,The superior days of eBay,"I just stumbled upon this Reddit through /r/random.

I immediately got flashbacks from the good old days of me being a kid earning a bit of money through eBay. I used to sell stuff for my family and got a share of 5-10% depending if it was my grandmother or my parents. It wasn't like we sold stuff every week and I didn't make a fortune through this but over the years i had 130ish successful listings. 
But the positive memories don't just revolve around the money I earned. It was the fact that setting up my listings and communicating with other Ebayers felt like I had my own company, was independent and a small part of the working society. I even read articles and watched videos about improving your listings to draw more attention and improve me and my families profits.

So, for the 3rd time I'm trying to buy PS4 Spiderman through eBay, but it seems it's not 3rd time lucky...
1st, got an automatic refund from eBay as they said the seller account had been hacked (should have known that if it's too good to be true...)
2nd, seller never sent the game and when I asked him what's up, just cancelled without any communication or refund. Had to get eBay to refund me.
3rd, seller had a picture of game of the year edition (the one I want) but in the item description it didn't mention it, so prior to bidding I contacted the seller to ensure if he was selling the one pictured, which he confirmed. Great! 
Bidded, won, paid! All good. Waited until the first day of expected arrival and the item wasn't even marked as dispatched so gave the seller a shout... He didn't even reply and simply marked the item as dispatched. Waited until 1 day past the new expected delivery deadline and nothing. As I was already fed up, didn't even contact the seller and simply opened an item did not arrive case.
1 day later the item arrived, so maybe everything was finally sorted... Nop, open the envelope and obviously it had to be the regular version of the game... Ffs!!! Ahhhhhh!!!!!
As I wasn't sure what to do, if I should cancel the DNA case and open a new one or what, and also because all the available eBay actions regarding this case were shown to me in german (that will teach me not to use a dodgy snipper), I gave eBay a call and explained the situation. They helped me to cancel the DNA case and open a return one, but no labels were generated so they said I had to wait the standard period before asking them to intervene. 
I decided to give the seller a shout, as I just want to send the game back, get a refund and don't even want to leave him bad feedback as it might be a genuine mistake.
He replied and here's where it gets a bit strange for me. 
He told me that he's going to be out of the country tomorrow (a bit convenient) and has no time/availability to generate the returns labels (is this a long-winded process? I really don't know) so instead he asked me if I can pay for the postage myself and he'll refund me for it. 
Now, I'm not sure if by doing that I will still be protected by eBay's guarantees, so I politely  declined. I told him that he has still a few days before the case can be escalated to get things sorted. He also told me that he had 2 games and his wife sent the wrong one but I only ever saw the listing for this one on his page.
Also, if he is out of the country then who's going to receive the game and issue a refund? Couldn't they get the labels sorted?!
He was very keen to know if the game was still sealed, which of course it was, but I guess that is a genuine concern...
All in all it might be a genuine mistake and I might be overthinking it a bit, but I'm wary because of the previous experiences... 
Should I take any extra precautions when packing the item, like a video or such?! 

If you managed to read all of this, thanks for your attention!!",3,2,2019-11-07,EBAY,0.07001309096813202,0.901231586933136,0.028755299746990204
Ebay,Bullet dodged: serial-neg buyer asks dumb question,"So I have an item listed. It's a seat for a vintage car - a 'special edition' that was made one year only with a blue and silver color scheme.

* The item title says ""Dark Blue vinyl driver's seat for \_\_\_\_\_\_ Special Edition""
* The condition includes ""Correct Dark Blue Color for \_\_\_\_\_\_ Special Edition""
* The description includes ""This seat is the Dark Blue color used only in the 197\_ Special Edition.""
* The listing includes the part number for the item (which is color-specific).

***Buyer asks ""Is it Dark Blue?""...***

So first thing I go check ""feedback left for others""... **It's a SEA of red hockey-pucks**.  And it's not even someone who ""only leaves feedback when there's a problem""... He's got a total feedback score of 65, and he's left *flippin' 47 negs and neutrals.*

Icing on the cake... His LATEST negative is for another item from the same car where he says ""Wasn't Dark Blue""... and the seller responds: ""Confused... item is exactly correct Dark Blue Color for this car""

More icing on the cake... That seller is a competitor I watch. He's good. Knows his stuff, describes accurately, etc. I watch him -precisely because- he's a strong competitor who doesn't f\*\*\* around.

***I couldn't click to my block list fast enough...***

Let me be clear: I'm not ""anti buyer""... Honestly, the buyers in the vintage car parts category are mostly really great. Yes, they can be demanding, but it's -usually- that they REALLY know their stuff and ask detailed questions. I'm FINE with that. Dealing with real aficionados normally goes great if YOU know your stuff as well as they do.  I see the stories here from other categories (e.g. electronics, clothes) and thank my stars I deal with good buyers 99.9% of the time.

But when the lemon comes along, I've learned the hard way to block first and ignore questions later...",29,100,2019-11-08,EBAY,0.04678870365023613,0.9219267964363098,0.031284503638744354

Ebay,Crazy/Rude Ebay Buyer Just Need To Vent,"I sell electronics on eBay full time and have been doing this for about 6 years now.  Computer people can get nasty sometimes, but these are the rudest message I have ever received.

The buyer sent me a message asking if I could sell an item for almost half the price I had it listed for.  He said he would be willing to ""take it off my hands.""  When people phrase things that way, I know they are usually trouble LOL.

It's a vintage Apple computer.  It has been listed for some time with 12 watchers.  In my experience, these computers take a while to sell and sometimes I need to lower my price slightly, but they eventually will sell.  I was already considering lowering the price by $5 or so but hadn't gotten around to it yet.

I was busy and on mobile, so after he sent that message asking for 50% off, I simply responded ""No thanks""

He sent back a message saying ""When you get your head out of your ass and decide to sell instead of being dumb and having your item sit on eBay with no buyers, let me know.""

I was in a bad mood so responded.  I know I shouldn't have and it probably wasn't the best move.  I responded telling him he was acting like a toddler who didn't get his way. I told him I wouldn't sell to him regardless of his offer, even if it was much more than I had wanted, and asked him not to contact me again.  Then I blocked him and reported him to eBay.

I also decided to lower the price by $5, since I was planning to anyway.  It honestly had nothing to do with this individual.

I am female and my first message (the no thanks one) was signed with my first name, so the buyer knows I'm a woman.   
While I can't be sure, I believe his next response had a sexist edge to it.  Maybe this is how he talks to everyone though.  He said: ""I see your bitch ass lowered the price like I said you should. I'm glad your (spelled wrong) at least smart enough to follow my directions.  Keep voting for Trump and lower the price more and maybe I'll consider buying from you.""

I'm not sure what Trump has to do with an Apple computer sale on eBay?

I reported him again. eBay says they are ""looking into it"" but I doubt anything will happen.

Ebay,PayPal in favour of buyer (saying received empty shoe box £425),"Hey,

My girlfriend sold some YSL shoes on eBay and got £425 for them. 
She sent them recorded delivery and still has the receipt. 
The buyer has received the shoes but has put a claim on PayPal to say the box was empty. 
My girlfriend uploaded the receipt to PayPal resolution center and you can see the weight of the parcel (1.5kg) so obviously the box isn’t empty. 
PayPal have gone in favour of the buyer. So now she has a free pair of YSL shoes and my pregnant girlfriend is left crying. The case is now closed. What do we do next?

Ebay,I just got my first negative feedback.,"I sold a kids toy that could be plugged into the wall or it can use batteries. Before I mailed it out I tested it thoroughly.

 I told her it works when I use batteries with it. Then i  got a message and she said it  and said it does work they have faulty batteries in it. However they went out and spent $20 on new batteries and they want me to give him the $20 back. I told them no I was not going to get them $20 for the batteries. 
But if they wanted they could send it back and I would give them a refund. They said no it was for their kids  They said if I didn't give them $20 they were going to report me to eBay. I told him I was not going to give them the $20 back and they could go ahead and send it back. Well they left me a negative feedback saying that I sold them something that didn't work. I responded that the buyer told me it did work. I called eBay about it. They said the report the buyer. Cuz she was asking for something that was outside of the listing. But they're not going to remove the negative rating because they have to investigate it and that could take up to 3 days. Well that's three days that I'm trying to sell stuff.

Ebay,"Brought ""excellent"" used phone with unadvertised burn in... half the screen is pink!","Hi all,

I recently purchased a used Galaxy S8 phone on ebay. It was advertised as follows:

""Cosmetic condition: Excellent.

 Condition is Used. Always had cover and protector on. The phone is in perfect working order.""

The phone is cosmetically good on the outside and matches the pictures. However, on turning on the screen, it has severe burn in. There were no photos showing this. Half of the screen is full on pink with a white background, and I can make out the previous owners entire home screen! It was the first thing I noticed on booting it up. Just...pink...everywhere...

Is it worth seeking a refund?  I'd even be happy with a partial refund and keeping the phone tbh. I am not sure how ebay would look at this. On one hand, the buyer did not mention this at all. On the other, the phone looks like the photos. But the photos can be counted as deceptive...

Ebay,Questionable Buyer Name - Advice Please,"Hi!

I recently sold something in my store, and when I went to ship it, this was the name listed on the shipping screen - “SENDIT - Milcid Rob Travis Johnston 280-233188”.

I substituted the name and numbers with placeholders (to protect the buyers identity). But, does this “name” throw up a red flag to you?

Ebay,I really HATE d-bag sellers who pull this stuff...,"Just happened across a listing, in my selling category, where the seller says:

&gt;We are dedicated to pleasing our customers and will do whatever necessary to make sure you're happy with your purchase. However, we require a 30-day ""cooling-off"" period after you receive your item before filing any disputes.

A) I suppose MOST people don't fall for this anyway, but it's still shi++y in my opinion to try and goad people past the dispute period.

B) I hope most buyers are savvy enough to realize what this is and avoid the seller entirely.

C) I hope any buyers who fall for it at least find their way here to learn about PayPal 180-day disputes.

I take comfort in the fact they appear to be not doing much value (In the last month they've sold 78 items for an ASP of $19) AND they've racked up a fair percent of negs (they're at 96.7%, which I consider low).

So I suppose it's a bit 'self-correcting'... but at the same time as a seller, the ""one bad apple"" factor still ticks me off.",41,76,2019-11-12,EBAY,0.10109663754701614,0.8647686839103699,0.03413471207022667

Ebay,Listing Limitations,"This is more of a rant than anything else, but I've been selling for 3 or 4 years now, and I honestly believe that eBay is nuts for their arbitrary handicap on the number of free listing insertions per month. Honestly it if were me, of course I would want to have sellers buy into a premium storefront options but I'd go about it completely differently.

Normal users in good standing would pay 10% commission on sales.  
New users (1st year sellers) would start with 12.5% commission to start until they have a small history of performing well as a seller and then it would drop to 10%)  
Normal users in under-performing standards would pay 15% commission on sales  


Storefront users would pay between 3.5% and 7.5% depending on their tier and would be the preferred sellers (of course to keep them happy) ... All while getting the premium features and advantages they normally enjoy. 

But everyone gets unlimited listing insertions.

Ebay,I need advice on how to ship a 250 lb elliptical.,"The elliptical I want to sell is brand new and the packaging hasn't been opened yet. The box dimensions are 66"" x 23"" x 34"" and the gross weight is 250 lbs. I called UPS support for a hypothetical quote to ship to New York, NY from 2500 miles away in the US. IIRC the support representative told me it would be somewhere around $4500...

One question I remember answering from the representative was whether the box could have anything stacked on top of it. I told him no and I think this no doubt added to the price. However, after further thinking, I believe the box could have other boxes stacked on top of it but I'm not sure of how much weight. I presume there has to be styrofoam inside which fills up any extra space plus I think it would be further supported by the elliptical frame pieces so maybe it can withstand another 250 lbs, at least?

I also told him the package would have be delivered directly to a personal residence. This probably contributed to the shipping fee as well. I don't think there would be any alternative though, unless there is an option for the buyer to pick it up at a shipping depot. 

Does anyone have any advice? Would FedEx or USPS be better? If not, I guess I'm going to list it for local pickup only. Thanks in advance.",13,4,2019-11-14,EBAY,0.02063637413084507,0.9132552146911621,0.06610845029354095

Ebay,Learned My Lesson: Don't Buy Electronics From Chinese Sellers in China,"In April 2019, i bought two generic branded tablets that looked really good from the images. Like they might as well have been Samsung tablets by the style. In May, i finally received them and they ended up looking like those crappy toy tablets they make for kids. One even has the screen all scratched up. 

Well i contacted seller, ss.well, and seller told me to return them so i started a return on eBay. Seller said to pay for the return and they'll send me an address and reimburse me for the products and the shipping. Don't fall for this. Apparently, as i just learned, eBay should have refunded me and seller should have paid for return shipping. That's what happens when you don't know the return system well and the policies are not clear.

Well i paid $70 in shipping to return them. According to tracking, they were stuck in Chinese customs for 5 months and then a few weeks ago i get a knock at the door and, to my unwelcome surprise, the tablets are back. No reason. No anything. 

Because eBay policy only covers for a few months and their cases close after 21 days, there was nothing i could do through eBay. Paypal, i learned, has a policy of 180 days, but alas, Chinese customs stole those months from me. I mean the timing was so perfect it almost seemed like they were waiting out the protection periods. Seller got paid and could care less.

Ebay,Buyers Counter-bid lower than his original bid (Unreal!),"I had a $20 item with a make offer.

Someone offered $15. I countered with $17.50. His counter was 14.95. Less than his original offer.

It really struck me as insulting. eBay shouldn't even allow a buyer to do such thing, imo.

Then again, I have not researched offer/buying strategies and psychology. And I suppose each product category has their own idiosyncrasies. If anyone knows of a handbook for such strategies, I'd love to read it.  


I let it lapse and have no regrets. Still, my paradigm is if you make a bid you expect a reasonable counter if you really want the product so you bid accordingly.

Ebay,Why is the shipping price displayed to the customer always HIGHER than the actual price I pay for shipping?,"I've been an eBay member for 19 years but only recently started selling on a regular basis. I must be doing something wrong. When I offer calculated priority mail shipping, the price that is displayed to the customer is always a dollar or two higher than the actual price I wind up paying.

For example, I offered calculated Priority Mail shipping on an order that sold today. The price displayed to the customer and which they paid was 11.95 for 3 lbs. I wound up putting some extra things in and the package turned out to be 4 lb. When I paid for the shipping through PayPal it came to just over $10 for 4 lb - less than the price that had been displayed to the customer for 3lb.

this happens every time I use calculated priority shipping on eBay. What am I doing wrong? I would like those numbers to match because I don't like overcharging customers for shipping.",12,2,2019-11-16,EBAY,0.04172651842236519,0.9141425490379333,0.04413091018795967

Ebay,"Buyer requested refund for laptop due to damaged screen on 11/16. Computer was delivered to Portland, Oregon with signature confirmation on 11/4, but buyer stated in eBay message that he is currently in Vietnam. Laptop was in excellent, like-new condition when shipped.","I recently listed a nearly-new Dell XPS laptop, eligible for shipping in the US only. The laptop sold within a few days and was delivered on 11/4 to the buyer’s PayPal address in Portland Oregon. Item was shipped fully insured with signature confirmation.

I received a return request from the buyer on 11/16 stating that 1) he or she received the laptop today (11/16) and 2) the screen was defective and the battery discharges too quickly. Though the buyer chose the “return request” option in the initial request, he or she arbitrarily asked for $200 for the anticipated cost of repairing the damage.  I initially dismissed the “received today” portion of his message because I could tell English isn’t the buyer’s first language and because I have a signature/proof of delivery dated 11/4. 

I replied that the laptop was in perfect working order when shipped, but could have been damaged in-transit between Atlanta and Oregon. I offered to pay the full cost to repair the laptop (regardless of amount) provided the buyer supply a verifiable, itemized estimate from Dell or an authorized repair facility.

The buyer responded asking for an extended warranty since he/she lives in Vietnam. So I suspect the buyer has friends or family in the US and has them ship items to him/her overseas. This explains why the buyer just received the laptop even though I have proof of delivery on 11/4. It also explains why the buyer didn’t accept the offer for a partial refund since any estimate provided would be in Vietnamese. 

All of this is documented in eBay correspondence so I am inclined to completely reject the buyers request. Any damage to the laptop likely occurred between Oregon and Vietnam, and I should not be held liable for any damage occurring after delivery to the verified PayPal address. 

I would like to get feedback from more experienced sellers before rejecting the request.  I know eBay typically favors the buyer, so I don’t want to waste my time fighting this if I don’t have a solid case.",4,5,2019-11-17,EBAY,0.0681057721376419,0.8959394097328186,0.03595484048128128

Ebay,Listing removed for confusion reason.,"So short history in 1999 Teletubbies released a plush doll that talked and some people thought it made a sound like an offensive word so it was recalled.

In any case I have had one listed for a year until today when it was removed due to ""offensive content"".  I got a link to the policy about how Nazi items or items that promote terrorism are not allowed.

So I called Ebay and the rep was confused about why it was removed.  He couldn't find any actual policy reason as to why it was taken down or give the exact reason.

He said it was probably because it had the words ""potty mouth"" in the title or because it had the word ""recalled"" in the description but he couldn't be 100% sure.  I asked about a list of words I couldn't use but again he said the he didn't even know so sellers obviously couldn't get one.

He even told me it was fine to remove the words and relist it which makes no sense if the item is really banned.

In any case should I just throw the item away / relist it ?  Just all around confusing situation.

Ebay,Buyer says product is not authentic,"Help! I recently sold my first product on eBay. They were a brand new Apple product unopened (100% authentic). I selected no returns because my friend warned me about people using things and then returning them weeks later. 

The buyer has since come back saying he visited an Apple Store and was told they are not authentic. Using the same serial number and model number I confirmed (just to be sure) at my Apple store that they are authentic. AND you can look up the same numbers online and see it yourself. He is lying.

He either swapped out my product (says he opened them otherwise I would’ve accepted the return) OR just decided he did not want them. 

In my listing I mentioned they were a gift (maybe a rookie mistake?) I don’t have a receipt because of this.  And he potentially is taking advantage of that. 

His seller/buyer rating is good- that is way I’m confused/concerned. Will he get away with this? I have no ratings because it’s my first listing but it’s really not fair. And now I don’t know if they will come back authentic and even if so they will be worth less now that they are opened.

Update: 

Buyer opened case to return the item. I ended up providing him a shipping label and he claimed the label “didn’t work”. After days on the line with eBay support they ended up siding with me after he still hadn’t returned my AirPods. Case is closed for now. 

This whole process was super stressful and I’m def never selling on eBay again but eBay did end up protecting me- although i still had to waste money on a return label 😫

Ebay,"Buyer put in a return request 37 days after receiving the item, I declined it. Will they have a case if they escalate to PayPal?","Back in early October I sold a lego set on Ebay. It had been in my attic for a few years and when getting decorations out for this fall I had seen it and decided it might be a good sell. I looked over all the pieces, ensured there was no damage or missing ones, and then sold it and shipped it out.

This November, on the 16th, the buyer who bought my set suddenly messaged me saying there were missing pieces. Okay, understandable, I assumed that it could be possible that I missed a few. I said if he could send me a parts list of what is missing, I’d look it over and see what I could do. 

After asking for this, he goes on to say that not only are pieces missing, but apparently the figures were damaged too, having ‘bite marks on the head and cracks in the torso.’ Now, I know this is completely false, because there is no way those pieces that have been sitting up in an attic in a box for the past few years got any sort of damage. I don’t even have a pet at home, so I have absolutely no clue how bite marks could exist on the pieces. 

However, even still, I went ahead and asked again for a parts list, stating that if there truly is damage on the figures and he could show me and tell me which ones are damaged that I’d see what I could do. He then proceeded to not respond for 24 hours, and since the return response window ends the 21st and I have work today, I went ahead and declined the request.

I know with eBay’s return policy I’d likely fall into the winning side on this case. However, apparently PayPal’s policy is not 30 days, but 180 days. I’m afraid that even though he requested this return far too late on eBay that he might find some way to open up a case on PayPal and continue fighting it. I unfortunately don’t have many pre-shipped pictures of the item aside from the one for the item listing, in which the figures are visible and there’s no visible damage on them, but he may try to claim the damage are in spots that are not visible in the pictures anyway, and I don’t exactly know how to respond to that.

I fully believe this is either a loss or damage on his part or buyers remorse, as how would you not notice ‘heavily damaged’ figures right out of the box? I don’t know if that’s enough of a case if it’s brought up to PayPal though. What should I do from here?",32,20,2019-11-20,EBAY,0.09259864687919617,0.8774217367172241,0.0299796462059021

I was going to let the case close automatically since it arrived but to my surprise the seller issued a refund. I feel that the seller should still be paid for the item since it arrived but was delayed because of USPS, what is the best way to contact them and arrange for that?

Ebay,Seller used different delivery option without vacation hold (UPS vs. FedEx),"Please give me advice on this and thank you so much for taking the time to read this and respond. I tried using the search bar and while I found posts on the same subject matter of the seller changing up the delivery method, I couldn't find anything for my unique case so I'm hoping someone can give me advice on the next step(s) I should take.   

I ordered an item yesterday with guaranteed delivery by Friday and the shipping method was listed as FedEx. I had it shipped to my university address, but I will be leaving for Thanksgiving Break Friday as well. (I didn't wait until next week because I had a 10% eBay Bucks promo and this was a $50 order.) The seller shipped the item today, but they used UPS instead of FedEx.   

The reason this is a problem for me is because FedEx gives free 14 day vacation holds, but UPS charges $5 past 5 days and I will be gone 11 days including weekends. I'd rather not leave an expensive item outside my door for almost two weeks and I wouldn't have bought the item at all if the seller didn't explicitly have FedEx or USPS listed as the shipping service.   

Where should I go from here and do I have a case? Can I ask the seller for $5 to cover the delivery hold charge? If so, is it even worth asking with $5 being 10% of the item's value? Submit the delivery hold then try to get my money back after? Ask eBay customer support? Hope it comes on Friday before I leave? It's Thursday so I don't have time to waste since delivery holds have to be requested a business day before, thus I need the quickest solution possible once business hours start.

Ebay,Seller used invalid address and sent empty package,"Here's what happened:

I purchased a bicycle wheelset from a Chinese seller. I had to wait about a month before I could email the seller about not receiving the item.

The seller used OrangeConnex shipping but listed the shipping as China Post in Ebay. The OrangeConnex tracking number of course doesn't work with China Post tracking. Also they seem to have switched tracking numbers in ebay after I emailed the seller about not receiving the item. I had to email OrangeConnex customer support and thankfully they gave me the USPS tracking number. Without that I'd be out of luck

The USPS tracking looks

Disposed by Post OfficeYour item could not be delivered to the intended recipient or returned to sender. It has been disposed of by USPS.**October 30, 2019, 1:48 pm**Arrived at Post OfficeBOULDER, CO 80301 **October 30, 2019, 11:24 am**Out for DeliveryBOULDER, CO 80303 

Note that the USPS tracking doesn't say the address is invalid; it just says it could not be delivered which could be interpreted as I was not able to sign or they couldn't leave the package. And it's very odd that they would just dispose of a package containing a valuable item the day after they got -- with no additional delivery attempts.

After a few days of back and forth with the seller, where he says I signed for the item, I ask Ebay to step in. I figured this would be a no brainer, but Ebay sides with the seller, saying the package is at the post office and I need to pickup.

Here's the exact email from ebay:

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi XXXXXX,

The seller provided tracking information that shows the shipping carrier tried to deliver the item to your address. You can pick it up from the shipping carrier.

After reviewing all the details of this case, we determined that you won't receive a refund.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/dzdum0/wheelset\_from\_china\_never\_received\_and\_ebay\_sided/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/dzdum0/wheelset_from_china_never_received_and_ebay_sided/) on reddit and get some good advice.

First I called USPS which was a big waste of time. They couldn't tell me anything aside from what the tracking number says.

Next I fill out a claim with USPS on missing mail. Here's what USPS responds with:

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This item was disposed by the post office. This usually happens when the contents of the package are unknown, leaking, or possibly hazardous and exposed. Please contact the sender or go to [usps.com](http://usps.com/) to file a claim.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well bike wheels shouldn't be hazardous or leak so that's really odd.

Next I go to post office #1. Not my post office but the one next to work. This post office is full of super nice knowledgeable old-timers. They print out a detail information from the tracking number that is not available to the public, which indicates the shipping address:

2137 and zipcode 80303.

That's it, no street. There's a bunch of 2137 addresses in my town, none of which are my address. They also could tell me the class of the service is lightweight so USPS won't return it if undeliverable, they just toss it in the trash. Lastly they told me the USPS takes a photo of the item before disposing.

Last stop is my post office. These folks are a bit clueless but I ask them about the photo and they pull up a photo of the item on their computer and let me take a picture of it.

[https://imgur.com/a/XrFXDYM](https://imgur.com/a/XrFXDYM)

The photo is a tiny packet, only a couple inches in dimension. It clearly shows the tracking number the shipper provided and it's pretty obvious at this point the seller did not send a wheelset as that would have come in a rather large box.

I call ebay and explain the situation, then get escalated and explain it again. Then they let me upload the documents and after a day email me saying they will refund me.

This was a huge headache all in all with phone calls and waiting in line I took about 2 hours off work to sort this out, but posting here so others may be aware.

Ebay,"Selling on eBay vs Amazon, what has been your experience?","Apologies if this is the wrong sub for this, i'm not exactly sure.

I sell a lot of refurbished electronics on eBay. Most of my revenue comes from reselling game consoles as they sell pretty quick and have a high price tag. However, game consoles in particular do have a high return rate. When I first started my first batch of 9 consoles sold I had 4 returns, this was 5 months ago. Now I get probably one return out of every 30 consoles or so. However, due to those 4 returns, a couple of buyer's remorse cases, and some parts being returned I know have a ""very high"" return rate according to eBay's return performance metrics for that category in general, which I think is a bit unfair given that consoles in particular have high return rates and it's being compared to a lot of other items in a broad category. But whatever, It's business, and I'm sure I can get the performance metric back down to high in the next two months. 

The thing that gets me is the extra 5% FVF now. The FVF for expensive items with a seller account is 4%, so I'm actually paying a little less than 10% still, but nonetheless that makes me angry. I'm also sure now my listings aren't getting as much organic traffic on this account in the video games category.

I started a new eBay seller account to sell consoles on to avoid the extra 5% fee. I listed my current stock of consoles on there, however, on new accounts it takes a day or so before they actually show up in search results... I think. On my main account they always show up within a few minutes.

I looked into selling on Amazon, and the referral fee is 8% for this category along with a small closing fee (forgot what it was) and Amazon doesn't charge the referral fee on shipping or that's what their fee calculator said. So it comes out to be almost the same as eBay as Amazon doesn't have a PayPal fee and eBay charges on shipping with seller accounts on both platforms. 

Seems like a good deal to me.... The only thing i'm worried about is dealing with more returns or possible returns fraud on Amazon. 

Anybody here sell on both? What do you like or don't like about each and which do you think is superior?

Ebay,A story I had on eBay from the summer...,"So myself, my brother, and my dad all resell and split the profits 3 ways.

On Monday, we received an email from that guy who said we sent the wrong item and that we just sent a book.  I tell my dad and he calls eBay.  During the call, he realizes he just shipped it today, and since the guy was about 800 miles away, it was impossible that it reached him (we don’t ship priority).

Ebay,"Buyer possibly destroyed product, INAD likely on its way...","Shipped a commercial grade coffee maker in working condition. Upon arrival, it seems the buyer was unaware how to operate which likely led to the unit being ruined. 

For example, they poured excessive water into the unit and burned the circuit board. They now have had an electrician open it up and I have no idea what they have done inside. 

He’s also contacting the manufacturer for options. 

The buyer is responding and is good intentioned, but how will this end if and when he puts in an INAD. 

How will eBay see this? Am I not protected from lack of knowledge on buyers part? Once they open it up, how can they claim INAD especially if it were installed or operated incorrectly?

I will likely have no choice but to refund the buyer and let them keep it because of the shipping expense. 

Thoughts?

Ebay,Buyer and local pick up cancellation,"I am looking for advice on an issue..I have a buyer that purchased an item that was listed as local pick up only. They paid with PayPal for the item and then I received a message from them saying of the shipping is not free they want their refund. 

I clearly pointed out to them it was local pickup and showed it in the listing. They were a new eBay member with 0% feedback. So I believe they made a mistake when they saw the item info for “shipping : free local pickup” 

Clearly error on their part. They are in another state.


Q#1. How do I go about giving the refund correctly. Without giving them the ability to leave negative feedback. I read if I give the cancellation request that leaves me open to negative feedback or downvote. 

Q#1b. Do they submit a cancellation, or Do I refund with PayPal first, or through eBay cancellation first if I have to do the steps.

Q#2. Also will I be refunded the PayPal transaction fee? I am aware of the .30 they charge which I don’t mind paying, but I believe they also have percentage of the sale price (I think the rules for the refunds changed recently but I couldn’t find a definitive rules for that).

Q#3. If I am not refunded any fees for the paypal, can I charge or refund the buyer the difference? The item was $300. I don’t want to have to be charged .30 + plus the PayPal fees on top of that, when it was their mistake. My listing also says any buyer could be charged any restocking or shipping fees for any returns.

Ebay,Am I out $450 for a faulty part?,"I bought a winch plate from a seller with great reviews, plenty of sales and solid shop rating. The plate arrives and the holes to mount it are misaligned. I contact the seller and he tells me that this has never happened before but if I return the plate he will send out a new one. Cool except I paid $75 shipping and he wasn’t willing to even cover a portion of the return shipping costs. I shipped the part back via UPS and after tracking confirmed it’s arrival and I didn’t hear anything for a few days I found out that it was shipped to a wrong address in CA, not PA. I contacted the seller and he told me that it was sent to his old address, he didn’t change his address for his business when he moved. He also mentioned he’ll help in any way he can but “he’s not paying another cent.” To be clear, he hasn’t paid anything at this point. At some point I also found out he was supposed to include a way to ship the part back when he sent me the part, he did not. I contacted eBay and despite seeing that the seller made a manufacturing error and admitted to not updating his address, there is nothing they can do. The part is sitting in a UPS facility in CA since the current people at the address refused the package and I’m out almost $500. I do not understand this. The seller made an error in manufacturing, failed to include a return shipping method and failed to update his business address. How is he not at fault in any way?

Ebay,I done goofed.. accidentally swapped orders - both buyers asked if it’s possible to get their original orders.

Luckily, both of them were super understanding and both of them have asked me if there is any way they can get their actual order. 

I know there’s no way I’m allowed to give them the other buyer’s information, but would it be against eBay policy for them to ship the item back to me (with no return case open) and me ship them back out to the CORRECT guy? (again, not through eBay but just me paying for it myself)

In my previous experience of of buying *and* selling, payment is always sent via Ebay. You checkout, enter your card details, then Ebay makes sure the payment gets to the seller. The buyer doesn't have to know the seller's Paypal details. 

However, in this case, the buyer won't pay me because she keeps asking for my Paypal email address. Is this how it works with offers, i.e. does the transaction occur solely through Paypal without Ebay as the middle man? Or is there a way my buyer can send me payment through Ebay like normal?

Ebay,Buyer asked for a refund in a message - what are my options?,"I have recently sold a phone on eBay. I've been using this phone for couple of years and it was left unsed for few months before I sold it. At the point of sale I wiped it clean and checked that I can create a new account, etc.

The buyer confirmed in a message that the item was delivered (tracking system for the courier was faulty at the time and eBay didn't update to deliver). Few days later I got a message of the buyer saying that the phone worked great when he got it, he said that they got a car charger for it and that later the phone stopped working completely. I asked them to try different chargers, try toubleshooting online or take it to the repair shop for a second opinion. I also suggested that maybe the new charger damaged the battery (I only charged the phone via normal charger).

Today the buyer contacted me saying that the phone is completely dead and that he wants a refund. No case was open yet, so I wonder what are my options. Given that the item was working when delivered (and the buyer confirmed that via eBay) and only stopped working when the buyer was using it, am I obliged to honour the refund?

I never had problems with this phone before I sold it, apart from a bootloop that was fixed by the manufacturer (this fact was mentioned in the listing). This is the first item I ever sold, so I'm not sure what my options are. Would appreciate some honest opinions!
