You can no longer sell items on eBay
Hi Diggsentme:

We want to let you know that you haven’t met the minimum requirements to sell on eBay and your seller level is Below Standard in the Global program. As such, you won't be able to list and sell items on eBay anymore.
Selling standards are in place to ensure that sellers deliver a great customer experience to their buyers. They measure whether buyers were satisfied with your items and your customer service.
When you don’t meet the minimum requirements for selling, you are creating experiences that erode confidence and drive buyers away.
If you had any active listings, they've now been ended, and any selling fees paid for those items will be credited to you.
If you've recently sold items that you still need to fulfill or ship, do so promptly. You'll still be able to see any recently sold items in My eBay, send and receive messages, and of course, buy items on eBay.
To see more details on why your seller level is Below Standard, go to your Seller Dashboard.

Ebay,"I'm in the US, got an offer on an item from a buyer in Canada. I have free shipping on the item, and it's displaying that it would cost me $10 to send it directly to him.

Did the buyer specify additional terms to avoid going through the Global Shipping Program somehow? Buyer's feedback shows a history of being picky so I'm a little unsure.

Ebay,Shipping confusion - Newbie mistake,I'm more confused than I should be. I'm new to ebay and put up a couple of pairs of jeans. Not knowing any better I let ebay calculate the jeans which are now in an auction status with a couple of bids. It estimated the weight as half the size and is going to cost twice as much to ship.

Ebay,What would you do - returns,"My general policy is no returns except as required by law.

2 situations:

1. Post item to buyers eBay &amp; PayPal address. He checks tracking and says it's being returned to sender as address is wrong. Asks me to repost. I think I should ask him to update his PayPal/email address so I am covered and ask him to cover postage again, maybe I will kick in a couple of dollars to be nice. I haven't actually received the returned item yet.

2. Items arrive marked 'not at address-return to sender'. I contact the buyer and they say the address is right but they don't want them any more and want a refund. 

I am a little unhappy because it would appear to me she has done this to circumvent the no refund policy. I also have not opened the envelope yet but it looks pretty bartered and bruised. The items are only worth about $20 so either way I am thinking of refunding minus postage cost.

I am fairly new to this so appreciate thoughts ...",7,1,2016-02-01,EBAY,0.023063018918037415,0.9118509292602539,0.06508608162403107
Ebay,Mailing receipts (USPS). Having trouble getting a receipt from 2 of my local post offices when I drop off packages.,"As the title states, I am having trouble with 2 out of 3 of my local post offices printing receipts when I drop off items. I'm not talking about 50+ items. 10-15 on a busy day but normally about 5. My question is do I have to have the original paper receipt to file and insurance claim if I use ebay labels? I think I'm a pretty ordinary customer. Boxes have printed labels, I wait in line, and request a receipt when I hand over my packages. I like to have them on items over $50 just in case. Also, once I had to upload a receipt to show the drop off weight when a customer said the package arrived empty. So it saved my butt on that one. I can't always go to the one post office that gives me no hassle, so I would like to show something to the employee as to why I need a receipt. Found this but I am thinking that means when dropping off w/o a label.

I then see his most recent feedback which is ***""Don't sell to this guy. He read the description but lied to eBay""***

Then I confronted them I am not in the business of shipping to another address, and that sends huge red flags to me, he says:

""New message from: idemarke (201Turquoise Star)

Ebay,How NOT to ship electronics...,"Decided to give a first time seller a chance when I bought a PS2 last week. It hadn't shipped the day before it was supposed to be delivered so I sent the seller a ""Hey, what's up?"" message. He said he'd been having trouble figuring out how to ship through eBay but finally figured it out. Item shows up as shipped, I tell him thanks and let him know he can do it through PayPal or direct with a carrier if eBay gives him trouble in the future.

Fast forward to today and it shows delivered so I head home after work to claim my bounty... 

The seller taped one side of the box and [folded the other end shut!](http://imgur.com/9ze5Uxw,XpafXE6) The thing had absolutely no cushioning inside as well (though I can't be sure whether the seller didn't put any in at all or it just fell out in transit.) 

The PS2 was still in-tact but does not spin up disks. Went ahead and messaged the seller just now to be nice and see if they offer up a return/refund without me having to ding their account but **what in the hell were they thinking?!**

Edit: Seller responded very apologetically and offered a return for refund.

The case concluded this morning and I AM SOO HAPPY OMG

Due to a technicality, I do not need to refund the buyer the shipping I had offered in the case ($42). Because I had already used up my one-time partial refund back when they first purchased, to give them a shipping overcharge ($8)!! I cannot believe it.

&gt; eBay Customer Support has reviewed the case and made a final decision.
 
&gt; We decided not to issue the buyer a refund. You don't need to do anything else for this case.

&gt; Decision:

&gt; This case has been decided in your favor.

&gt; This case was found in your favor because this item isn't eligible for eBay Buyer Protection. Any feedback left, including detailed seller ratings, will be removed and won't affect your seller performance standing.

Ebay,Dubious INAD claim from a buyer.,"Disclaimer: I am not a car parts seller. I am just a 20-something year old girl who ended up with a surplus car part six months ago and has been trying to sell it heavily discounted ever since.

So - I bought a car wing mirror last year that ended up being surplus to requirements and have been trying to sell ever since (bought it for £31, it sold this past week for £15).

I posted it a day after funds were received. Two days later, I get a message from the buyer saying it not as described.

The part he THOUGHT he was buying was an electric wing mirror, the part was a manual/cabled car mirror. 

The listing NOWHERE mentions it is electric (not in the description or in the title). However, he claims the (very low res image that I found to represent the listing) image shows an electric mirror. 

I acknowledged straight away that if he wasn't happy, for whatever reason, that as soon as he sent it back, I would refund the cost of the mirror (£15) but not the shipping, as I personally feel like he assumed what he thought he was buying instead of clarifying what he was buying.

He said that this was INAD, and raised an eBay dispute to that effect. I then offered a partial refund of the full cost (£15 of the £20 that he paid that included shipping - so, the cost of the mirror minus shipping), on the condition that he could keep the wing mirror.

He refused that this morning, so I rang eBay. They sided with me - agreeing that the description and the title do not state the mirror is electric - and if the guy wants to complete a return, he will need to ship the mirror back to me at his cost.

So, I've told him this (or words to the effect of eBay's advice). And now I'm waiting to hear back - but this is seriously stressing me out and causing me a lot of grief. I feel like I've tried to be really reasonable here - but I'm not getting anywhere.

Thoughts? Advice? Suggestions? At the end of the day here I'm probably going to be out of pocket, just because this guy assumed he was buying something that wasn't described =/",6,3,2016-02-03,EBAY,0.04335736483335495,0.9108354449272156,0.04580720514059067

Ebay,Worried about Shipping Item Quickly,"Hi everyone. I want to sell something on eBay for the first time, but I think I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

Ebay,A quick tip for blocking buyers ... use paypal email address.,"Did you know that if you enter the *paypal* email address in your buyer block field it blocks the buyer? You do not need to know their ebay handle. This is a great way to block people if you happen to know their Paypal address but don't know eBay, or if you want to block any account associated with a Paypal addess. 

I blocked a woman a few months ago because of Facebook drama in a selling group. I didn't know her eBay handle but I got her Paypal address from another seller. I quietly blocked the Paypal address. I figured she'd try to buy from me sooner or later on eBay, and by her attitude, I wanted nothing to do with her as a buyer. Very angry woman. 

(I am one of the larger sellers of widgets that match her area of interest, so I figured we'd cross paths on eBay sooner or later.)

I woke up to ten flaming angry messages in my eBay inbox this morning when the buyer tried to buy from me and found she was blocked. She started out angry that she was blocked and then started tearing my store apart -- pointing out things she thought were overpriced, accused me of trying to rip off buyers with prices that were too high, accused me of ""stealing"" from collectors who lived on fixed incomes, and etc. 

Yup, not somebody I want to sell to.",15,20,2016-02-05,EBAY,0.2596451938152313,0.7172408699989319,0.023113956674933434

Ebay,Bad case of buyers remorse - please help,"Long story short, I sold a tablet on eBay (I'm not a new seller but I'm definitely inexperienced) and as soon as I ship it, the buyer started playing 20 questions. He was asking details about how I got it and trying to get out of me how much I originally paid. Not knowing how this would turn out, I made the mistake of telling him how much I originally bought it for, which was about $100 less than he just spent on it. Immediately he starts begging for a refund because he is a ""poor college student"" and apparently how much I spent on it should affect how much he can get it for. I just shipped it and he's already begging for a total refund on shipping. 

It goes back and forth him telling me that he can't afford what he just paid for and me telling him that I won't refund him. Eventually he starts with ""ok I'll just return it and buy a cheaper one"". I responded starting that I do not offer returns (as it says in the item description) and that if there were a cheaper one, he should have purchased that one instead in the first place. I guess he gave up on trying to get me on shipping because now he starts every message with ""PLEASE REPLY ASAP"" and is saying that he's worried about a possible discrepancy between the tablet and my description and that he will inspect it ""throughly"" and that his review will reflect this. I sent him a canned response defining the terms of the sale and description and said to let me know if there were any problems. He finally received the tablet today and, sure enough, there is an issue that didn't exist when I sent it and that I ""didn't mention in the description"". He's saying that there is something loose internally and threatening to open a case with ebay if I won't take it back. He offered to send a video of this problem and I’m thinking of taking him up on that. 

To me it sounds like he changed his mind right after I shipped it and is trying to get out of this purchase but not necessarily trying to scam me. I did insure the tablet when I shipped it just in case. How should I proceed? I have not yet replied to him.

Ebay,Scammed by a buyer for two items - eBay assist him!,"Just thought I'd share our most recent buyer scam story.
We run quite a large eBay business with 250~ orders being shipped per day so we come across every type of eBay buyer going.

Last week we sold two pairs of Nike trainers to a gentleman. Due to our returns being so busy we have auto acceptance rules and he opened a return case for both stating the size was wrong, the returns were automatically accepted as normal.

The next day both of his returns arrived with us and straight away I could tell there was something fishy as they were both A4 envelopes; we don't sell anything of that size so I immediately photographed the packages which shows his user info as he'd used an eBay label. 

I opened both packages to find a wad of paper in each and immediately contacted eBay, attached our pictures and a case was opened against the buyer for both of his returns. The lovely powers that be at eBays resolution center have this morning issued a refund for both of his returns stating that they had arrived and could not prove what was in them, despite my attached pictures.

I proceeded to ask what I could have done differently in this case to avoid it in future and the representative told me there was nothing else I could have done to prove he had scammed us and abruptly ended the call. 
Anyone had a similar experience and managed to win the case?",20,20,2016-02-06,EBAY,0.03120567463338375,0.9208829402923584,0.0479113832116127

Item arrived pretty quick tks. Unfortunately, I paid $120 today to install it and it did not work. I need to be reiumburse ASAP."" I was asleep by then. The buyer then leaves a negative sometime after midnight for being ""unreachable"".  His exact feedback was ""Item arrived. I installes and is not working!! Saler is unreachable!!!!!!"" I respond to his message saying ""I'm so sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you. I did have this item tested, by a certified mechanic, before shipment to insure that this blower motor works. Is it possible you car has some other problem, or did the dealer say with 100% certainty that this was the problem? Also, I am sorry that I am ""unreachable"", you contacted me at 8 PM on a Friday, way after business hours. I stride to make my customers happy, but I don't stay awake 24/7 responding to questions. Furthermore, eBay's rules gives us 48 hours to respond to sellers, you gave me less than ten (not sure when you left the negative), and this all happened while I was sleeping. I would have been happy to send you another one or something else. Hoping we can still work out this matter. Again sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you, thanks for understanding."" He responds to me 6 hours later saying ""Hi,
Thank you for your response. I was just really pissed as I paid the part plus paid the machanic to install and I did not work. I did not want to pay him again to take it out for now. I am open to work this out with you. What do you have in mind?"" He completely ignores my question about whether or not he know what his problem is so I send him this message, Have you figured out if the problem was with the blower motor, or something else? What did your dealer say? The problem may be something else such as the climate control, a fuse, relay, etc. I can send another one, but if that's not whats wrong then it will be pointless.

Update: After waiting for so long he finally responded with ""It is the motor. My mechanic already confirmed. I want to be reimbursed as I do not wish a used part anymore."" Notice he said mechanic, if there's anything I've learned, it's that this could be his brother, cousin, ect. or some local cheap mechanic, not someone to really be trusted. I ""kindly"" responded with ""Okay, please send my original item back to: [address redacted] for a full refund. Again, please make sure this is MY item. The item number and date will have to match up as in the pictures. Thanks, and again sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you. Glad we could work it out!""

Ebay,Reached the end of an... odd experience. Looking for some perspective.,"So I purchased a range hood for about $300 on eBay a month or so ago. When it arrived, I found it had been damaged during shipping. After notifying the seller, they promptly shipped me a replacement but despite my offer, they did not seem interested in having the damaged item shipped back.

Fast forward a few days, and the replacement arrives. When I finally get it out of the box a few days later, I find this one has also been damaged. I contact the seller again, and this time they opt to simply refund my payment. It now seems I am left with a refund and a net gain of two damaged range hoods.

Is this normal? I've seen this happen with smaller ticket items, but never with a $300 range hood. After a bit of research, it seems the eBay seller is actually the manufacturer, which does make it more plausible that their manufacturing costs are low enough that maybe it really isn't worth the trouble to have me send them back.

Still, the whole thing seems a bit odd. Have any of you sellers been on the other side of this type of situation? I feel like I'm just not seeing the whole picture and it's driving me nuts.",10,1,2016-02-06,EBAY,0.22223147749900818,0.739454448223114,0.03831411153078079

Ebay,"Buyer claiming damage, wants discount. Packaging is fine.","I sold a MacPro tower (2009) about a week ago. Packed it in a box that was 30 x 30 x 16, so there was nearly ten inches of packaging on each side. 

This morning the buyer messages me and sends a picture of the top hoop. It's bent a bit and he claims it was damaged in shipping and asks for a partial refund. I asked for pics of the packaging. He sends them, packaging is undamaged.

Now, I don't want to deal with a return and having to relist/resell, so I ask ""what would be fair"". He responds, saying ""$125-150''. 

Sale was for $775, btw. I had checked his feedback when I sold it and he is obviously buying to resell the parts.

I told him he's have to send it back for a refund, that was more than I was willing to do. He responds with ""I don't want to go through that hassle, what can you do?""

I offered $50, because that's what return shipping would cost me.

This is one of the very few cases where I feel a buyer is trying to scam me. It doesn't happen often.

Edit: He settled on $75. It irritates me, I personally packed it. It had 5 inches of hard foam around all sides. With no damage to the packaging, it is physically impossible for the damage to have occurred in shipping. I suspect it's a picture of a different system, actually. But they way things work with ebay, if he opened a claim, I'm out $875 (shipping both ways) until I get it back and resell it.

Ebay,Is this justified or normal?,"I'm a bit puzzled by what has recently happened to me on Ebay. I would like to start by explaining that I've had an Ebay account for about 10 years. In that time I've sold 2 things and bought maybe three, none of which have been in the past several years. I try to be as informed as possible but I'm sure I fall behind.


I decided to purchase a product. The seller has 8 of them for sale. He says in the description that he can save you money if you buy them in bulk so I decided to message him. The buy it now price for this item was $5 each + $15 for shipping (they aren't very valuable but are rather heavy) for a total of $20. So for all 8 it would be $160 or $80 for 4. The seller explained to me that he could send them out bulk but only 4 at a time, so two shipments of 4. He said by doing this he would need to send me an invoice and that it would be $60 for the 4 instead of $80 per 4, basically saving $20.


Here's where the fun starts. He messaged me and told me to click ""buy it now"" but to not pay until I received the invoice. I specifically asked him if after clicking the ""buy it now"" if I should click the confirm button. He replied to my message answering my other few questions but not responding to that one. I figured a screen would pop up after clicking ""confirm"" to ask me my credit card information and that it would at least clue me in on if that was where to go or not. Unfortunately it instantly bought them. I guess I had an automatic payment card set up on my account.


I messaged him and apologized and asked what I could do to make it right but he lost it on me. He began insulting me, calling me names, asking why people can't follow instructions (which he did not give when I specifically asked). I tried explaining to him that it was an honest mistake, what I could do to correct it and that whatever money he lost I would be happy to make up for. He continued flipping out. He then stated he would not be sending the other 4 as we agreed upon (which I hadn't paid for those 4 yet).


It was very weird and strange. I've not had some one flip out on me like that in ages. From what I understand, I paid $80 (buy it now) to him instead of $60 (invoice). He said he would refund me the $20 but that if I wanted anymore he refused to send them to me in bulk like the item description states and as we had agreed upon. I told him not to refund it, to keep it and that on the other 4 if he needed to charge extra to make up the difference to go ahead, but he still kept flipping out, calling me names and even insulting a compliment I paid to him about an accomplishment he had done in his life.


I'm not sure how badly I messed up by clicking ""buy it now"" but this guy went apeshit on me for doing so and refused to continue the rest of our agreed upon transaction. Did I really screw up that bad? If so then I guess he is justified. It just seemed really weird, especially when we are not talking huge dollar amounts.
So what do you guys think? I wanted to use a throwaway because this guy seems like the crazy stalker type to stalk, witch hunt and post personal information. Hopefully he doesn't frequent reddit...",12,1,2016-02-06,EBAY,0.044253475964069366,0.9209988117218018,0.03474777191877365

Ebay,"Looking to sell an item on ebay, and have a few questions","I have over 100 feedbacks as a buyer on ebay, but this time I want to sell an item.

Is the process relatively simple? I'm at work right now and havent had time to read up on selling with Ebay, gonna do that tonight and thought I'd ask here first.

1. i've seen some sellers state no refunds on their listings, does this actually hold any merit if the buyer purchases it and then demands a refund in the future? I intended to provide tracking, and the item im selling can't necessarily break.

2. are there settings when making your listing for things like, pay within 48 hours, no 0 feedbacks allowed, only paypal confirmed address? Just trying to protect myself as a seller. 

3. i see a lot of smaller items (and sometimes even large items) being sold with free shipping. how does this work? do the sellers always just pay the shipping fees in this situation? Or is it a setting on ebay?

4. As long as I ship the item, provide tracking, and it arrives, am I safe from the customer doing a chargeback or a refund or anything paypal and ebay related? I'm not selling anything shady, it's just this is my first time selling something on ebay and I don't want to/minimize dealings with untruthful buyers.

Ebay,[theory] eBay manipulates sales somehow,"Now before I go ahead, let me explain that I am a seller that sells in high volume. I mean not that high at there big kings but I make around 10k a week in sales. I have many listings (around 50,000).

What I felt like is that there is some sort of filtration method that limits my sales after a certain point (ie: sales slow down for the day). 

I have tested it by addin a really cheap item (way below cost I don't make profit on this item... I was intending to use it to increase my feedback).

As expected I sell a lot of this item for cheap but when that happens my main profiting items slows down.

After one week I remove the listing (ie: hide the cheap non profit item) and then my profiting items are selling quantities before my newly added item.

The next week I then put the cheap item back for sale and surprise surprise the other items slow down again and he week after that I removed and then sales are the same as before.

This new item is not even in the same category as my profiting items and I am beginning to suspect some manipulation is going to play here that eBay really wants to limit how the quantity of items you sell a day.

Though not entirely conclusive, I feel that this is good evidence to prove so, but I'll keep doing this for another few weeks and then adjust the length just to see if it is happening because of it(ie: remove add every 1 day, month or fortnight.).

If this is an instant effect (or noticing the pattern within 1 day) then I will be 100% certain this is it and I think it will be pure bullshit and bad form from eBay to prevent small sellers from ever going big.",31,17,2016-02-09,EBAY,0.042970992624759674,0.9009521007537842,0.05607697740197182

Ebay,"[x-post from r/Flipping] Refused delivery and Insufficient Address, eBay instructs me not to refund buyers?","I've been selling for years but shit has been hitting the fan lately.

I have two separate issues with two buyers, both were for the same item. I hope you enjoy these two stories, sorry for the length.

The first was an insufficient address issue. I shipped the item insured and signature confirmation, it goes out for delivery and is never updated, it defaults to the USPS ""not updated"". Buyer messages me the next day ""oops I forgot my apartment number"". I instruct him to call the local post office, I also do so myself. The package is lost, local USPS worker is useless and tells me ""well it's not here, file a claim"". Buyer fails to call USPS himself, says he wasn't able to. I assume the worst and figure I'll be making a USPS claim/dealing with an eBay case. Then about a week later the status updates to ""insufficient address"". Buyer messages me the next day, says he wasn't able to get it and apologizes. I responded that I would provide a partial refund if/when it comes back to me minus shipping cost and a restocking fee. Buyer apologizes again and thanks me.

The next one sells and I get an address with a long, Southeast Asian name AND number in the name field of the address. Buyer is a high feedback seller. After dealing with what I dealt with previously, I message the buyer to ask if they accidentally put an apartment number in the name field. They respond ""no, it's correct. thank you"". Today it goes out for delivery and the recipient refuses.

I called eBay, explained each situation. The CSR advised me NOT to refund the buyer at all in either situation. In the first case, I shipped to the verified address and the CSR stated the ""insufficient address"" status means I will automatically win any eBay case. In the second case, the CSR stated a refusal is against the eBay policy and the buyer loses any protection. CSR said that I clearly stated no returns, and neither of these were actually returns anyway so I have no obligation to refund.

I stated that I didn't think that was right, it would be unjust enrichment and that I wanted to provide a partial refund. The CSR advised against this every time I asked but said it was my decision. I was told I will not get the Final Value Fee back if I do a partial refund.

So I was convinced the rep was wrong, I called back and was told the exact same thing from another rep.

This can't be right, there is no way I'm going to keep $300 for each item and get the item back. At the same time, it's a large item so shipping and packaging was very expensive and if I have to also subtract the FVF then I'd still be keeping $60-70. The first buyer made a legitimate mistake, the second buyer I haven't had any communication with since the first message.

Ebay,Received counterfeit product (confirmed with Bose) - Listing disappears preventing me from leaving neg feedback to help others - sellers needs item returned for refund.,"So I purchased Bose headphones which turned out to be counterfeit (have emails saved between Bose and me). I initiated a refund with the buyer who asked me to ship the item back for refund. I noted that the item was sold to 15 others and hence wanted to leave negative feedback to help others. However, the listing disappeared and now eBay thinks I am neither purchasing or selling the item for feedback. I do not want to ship the item back to penalize the seller. eBay CS mentioned I will have to ship the item back and get refund. I opened a case with eBay who have asked me to provide proof to support my case (I forwarded the emails). 

Am I wrong? What are my options to let others know about the possibility of receiving counterfeit items from this seller?

Edit 1: eBay informed me it may be illegal to ship the item. They are requesting me to sign a document stating the product will be destroyed. 


Edit 2: Apparently it is a federal crime to use USPS to ship counterfeit item. Not sure about UPS/Fedex or other private careers.

Edit 3: I received full refund.

Ebay,"Scared of what is going to happen with this sale. I am trying to be fair, and I just don't believe I am in the wrong. How do these things get handled?","I sold a PS4 last week and the buy has reported a ""loud fan"" claiming this wasn't described in the listing. He wants me cooperate but I just don't see this. The reason being is that I know for a fact the device works. It was 100% tested before being shipped. The loudness of a fan is entirely subjective, and it could be a multiple of factors.

I've also googled it and it seems this is a common problem in the PS4 community, one I've never had to deal with because my PS4 was in a cabinet. 

Essentially the buyer is saying that he ""fixes"" PC's for a living and the loud fan is a sign it's broken and the device won't last. 

Here is the messages between us:

*I just received the PS4 today, the shipping was super fast! I do have an issue though, the internal fan is very loud. That wasn't noted in the description and it can be a bad sign as far as longevity. I happen to build/repair computers as my career and a failing fan can be a big deal. The small blemishes on the system are no biggie, it is used after all, but the fan noise is not expected wear, that's a problem that actively needs fixing before the system runs too hot and overheats. I did take a video of the fan noise although eBay will only allow photos to be sent through here it appears.*

*The only two options I see at this point are neither ideal.*

*1. Return/refund and you can handle it as you please to sell it again, perhaps to someone less savvy.*

*2. Refund a portion so I can fix the problem before it gets any worse.*

*Any other thoughts from your end?*


**If an internal fan is loud it means it's working. I would be more concerned if the fan was making no noise at all.**

**The device was working and tested before shipping.**

**I'm not sure how you want to handle this, the listing has no returns listed.**

*...if an internal fan is loud it's been damaged (like dropping) or the bearings are worn. It's possible it could have been jarred in shipping but you had it packaged very well I think.*

*eBay and PayPal both have a money back guarantee when items are not as described which they determine via review if needed. You don't get to say no returns no matter what as a seller (;*

*That said I don't have much desire to return it, I just also don't want to spend nearly $300 and then have to spend another $30-40 to have someone authorized replace the fan. I'm in a bad spot.*


**Does the device work and play games?**

*No, not as it should. That's why we're messaging.*
*If you bought a car and the gears were grinding on the way home would you consider that working?*

**Please google the problem. Loud ps4 fans are a common complaint in the community.**

**If the device is turning on and playing games. I have no other choice but to turn your request down. You can take this with eBay.**

**Your accusations of the fan being broken are anecdotal, and subjective. I respect that you have worked fixing computers. I myself have done the same. I think if you take the time to google the issue, you'll see many people experience the same thing. It's not a sign of malfunction.**

**Again what you are mentioning is common with PS4s.**

Ebay,"dealing with a questionable Buyer, please advise on how to proceed with this transaction","So I'm trying to sell my iphone 5S.  Spent 7 days for the auction.  A buyer won the item this past Sunday evening.  No payment received after 24hrs.  I reached out to the buyer to see what's up.  The buyer states that he bid on two phones and won both.  He said he paid for the other one and that'd he'd promise to do business with me in the future.  I'm like wtf kind of shit is that?!

edit:  Here's my plan:  ship with delivery confirmation and signature on delivery.  Anything else I should do for precautionary measures?

The item sold for $245.  I'm checking paypal's seller protection qualifications, I don't know if I'm missing anything obvious.

Ebay,Buyer not picking up package from Post Office,"Curious what to do if things don't change soon...

* I sold something worth several thousand dollars. 
* Buyer was responsive, paid within the two days. I am new to this, so left positive feedback.
* I shipped the item with insurance, and a signature required because eBay suggested it due to cost, and to prove it got there
* Arrived at address two days ago
* The tracking number says they couldn't deliver it due to no signee
* Tracking info site says buyer should call for another run or go get it
* After the next full day passed, sent user a friendly eBay message summarizing what shipper said

Today will mark two full delivery cycles with no response to my message. I may just not be waiting long enough, but if I bought something worth thousands of dollars, paid for it, and missed the delivery, I would make arrangements asap.

Questons:

* Has anyone ever dealt with this before? A paying buyer, who just won't go get his shipment?
* How often should I message the buyer in eBay to make sure he understands what is going on (or should I) without bugging them?
* The shipper says that if it isn't picked up or delivered in a few weeks it will come back to me, how do I handle that hot mess?
* What am I on the hook for as the seller when this happens?

Ebay,eBay Postage Policies and Additional Charges,"TLDR: I am trying to find a way to charge extra on only every say 40 square meters for example.

Currently on eBay you can add an additional charge for each increase in quantity. 

i.e. Base charge equals £40.00 with each additional being £0.50.

The items I sell are sent out on a pallet so the charge for me doesn't change until 40 m², so I only want to charge a customer extra when they buy more than 40 m², however as it is I have to charge a customer extra for every m², which means any one buying say 39 m² is paying more than they really should.

Ebay,Apparently ebay worries more about the safety of posting something to sell than the safety of buying stuff.,"I'm a little annoyed right now.  I did a clean up of my desktop a few days ago and deleted all my cookies and whatever. I do this at least once a month considering I'm on a crappy desktop at the moment.    

Anyways, I was able to log into my account no problem and buy a few things just the other day.  I tried selling two different items just a few minutes ago and I'm told that ebay apparently doesn't recognize my 'new' location from where I'm signing in.

I tried answering my security question and apparently I got it wrong three times in a row. Suddenly, I'm being given the option to verify via email. I can't though because I've answered my question wrong three times. Now I have to wait 24hours or contact ebay.  What surprises me is that I was not given the option to get a verification via email the first time around. I was hoping for it actually considering I can't remember my security questions since I made this account 10 years ago.    

What surprises me the most is that   
A) Ebay never FIRST gave me the option to get a verification via email    
B) Ebay didn't even bother to send me an email telling me of an 'unknown sign in'.  No ""Is this you? CLICK HERE TO CONFIRM"" No ""Hey someone just signed in from X address. Was it you? IF NOT CHANGE YOUR INFO RIGHT NOW!!!""     
C) I was able to successfully purchase a few things a day prior without any problems, without verifying that this 'new' location was mine.  I was able to pay via my paypal and have no issues what so ever.     

Yet when I try to post something to sell I'm thrown an error that what I'm trying to do is suspicious and I should verify it? It's no big deal, just a bit frustrated from that logic.  I was hoping to have sold a few items by morning so that I can ship them out early in the morning.  Plus I need a few extra dollars as well. I will admit. IT's my fault for forgetting my security questions. But at least give me the option to verify that it's me via email the first time around.     

tldr; Cleaned computer, and forgot security question. Ebay locks me out when I try to post something to sell, but it's cool to let me buy whatever I want without questioning if it's 'me' or some hacker.

Ebay,First return...so confused,"Received my first return request (been selling about a year, 100% positive feedback) today. 

Buyer used ""not as described"" and said that the largest size in the set was too small. I did not include measurements because the sizes for this item are very standard small, met, large, jumbo and I have never seen measurements given in any listings for these products.

I messaged the buyer asking for more info and verifying that she received the item as pictured. She hasn't responded yet.

I then called eBay and the rep took a few minutes and came back and said clearly it's buyers remorse and he will close it in my favor, buyer responsible for return postage and refund upon tracking showing delivered back to me.

I just checked my messages and received a message saying the case was closed in the buyers favor, full refund will be issued upon return of the item.

Now I'm confused. Is it closed in buyers favor assuming she returns it? Does it even matter given the new seller criteria? Or should it say sellers favor and I need to call again?

Ebay,Issue with a return (as a buyer),"For the sake of this thread let's just assume that I'm in the right (I can't convince everybody, but just in the situation that I am, how I would proceed).

I purchased a running board and when it arrived I quickly realized it wouldn't be compatible with my vehicle. I requested a refund, and they granted it. The company that I purchased from gave me a shipping label to ship the item back.

So naturally I slapped the shipping label on the product and dropped it off at the office. When the item arrived back at the manufacturer, they sent me pictures of what they received and told me that they didn't received the original item. In fact, it is a completely different item. I didn't even recognize the boxes in the pictures they sent me.

They are now asking me to return them the initial running board in question. Here's the thing though: the manufacturer has informed me that they have already shipped the item I (supposedly) falsely returned back to me. They're asking me to return the running board (which I do not have. I don't have any items to return, as I already shipped it back to them on the initial refund). 

The refund has already been processed. No case is open, and their inquiries are all being done through e-mail. Should I be worried? How should I proceed?

I have a receipt with the weight of the item I returned when I dropped it off at the post office. Would this be of any value to me in this situation?

Ebay,Can anyone help me with Canadian shipping?,"Hey guys, so I am a little stumped on shipping some stuff from Canada.

I plan on shipping 5 small toy figurines (not much taller then 2"") and was wondering what the most cost-effective way to do it is.

I have 8x6"" bubble mailers that can fit the toys(they are pretty durable, I am sure they would be fine), but am unsure on what exactly I need for postage/if I am even allowed to put something like that right into my mailbox/maybe there are better options.

My friend uses similar envelopes to sell cards and I think his total stamp costs are around 3-4 dollars. Can I do the same even though the figures will stick out abit more?

Also, I know you can print out shipping labels via ebay/paypal, but whenever I enter the dimensions of my package the cheapest option I usually get is something close to expedited shipping for around 15 dollars. Maybe shipping in Canada just sucks.

I guess a better question would be; do shipping labels for regular letters even exist on paypal/ebay?

Ebay,Buyer falsely claimed INAD. eBay ruled in their favor...but I got it overturned.,"A buyer bought a metal angel cherub (lamp part) from me a few days ago and upon receiving said that this wasn't a lamp part and would be returning it(and I have a no return policy).

They opened a case with eBay and eBay sided in their favor. The Morning I find out about it I called eBay and explained that I took 12 pictures of the item and said it was a lamp part in the description... And eBay actually agreed with me and overturned the refund.

Ebay,How do I ship an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) with a heavy battery?,"To avoid confusion with the acronym, I am referring to an [uninterruptible power supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply), commonly abbreviated UPS (NOT the shipping company).

It is 18.2 pounds, and more importantly it has a huge battery in it, which I believe has to be shipped hazmat and probably quite expensive.

Ebay,Bizarre situation...receiving items I did not purchase.,"I am an ebay seller and buyer of 16 years and I still buy and sell on a daily basis so I know pretty much everything about ebay. But I am not in an oddball situation that I have never seen or heard of before. I just thought I'd post here in case anyone else has ever had anything similar happen.

Last week a small item showed up in the mail that I did not recognize. IT had my exact name and address on it and was an ebay generated shipping label. I deal in car parts and this was a makeup item. I thought my wife might have somehow ordered it without my knowledge but she did not, I'm not even sure she would know how to access my ebay/paypal accounts if she wanted to, and she doesnt really wear makeup anyway. 

A couple of days later another nearly identical makeup item shows up here, also with my exact name and address. So now I know something fishy is going on. I check my ebay and amazon recent purchases and neither item shows up. I get on ebay and search for these items being sold currently, and also for the items that have recently sold as completed listings. I was able to match one of the items based on the seller's name and location and based on the purchase history of the item and the shipping label date. 

I contacted the seller of that item and told them what was going on. I asked for info on the buyer...their ebay account, the paypal account, and any communications they had where the buyer might have asked to ship to a different address or something. I'm not certain this seller really understands my intent, she chalks my communication with her up to my honesty in wanting to return her item to her. I am trying to get the buyer account information out of her but she seems unwilling to give many details. 

She did eventually send me a screenshot of the ebay user ID that made the purchase. She told me ""you have two ebay accounts"". Under the user ID of this account is my name and address. But the account she showed me is not one of mine. 

So I called ebay and had them check my account for unauthorized access. The rep had me log out and back into my regular ebay account, presumably to log my IP. She says everything looks okay on her end and there does not appear to have been any unauthorized access to my regular account (I assume by checking IP logs). She did take the info on the other ebay account and promised to check into it, and advised that she would not be able to give me any further info about what they found out.

I've checked my paypal account up and down for any purchases made or funds missing or not accounted for and I cannot find anything missing at all. I also checked my credit cards and bank account and likewise they all seem normal. I even checked amazon. So, it does not appear that anyone has accessed my buying accounts or my financial accounts, or that my money was used to buy these items.

The burning questions for me are 1) how did someone get my exact name and address, 2) why would they list it on another ebay account, and 3) how did they hope to profit from buying items using someone else's account and/or money and then shipping them to me?

The only thing I can think of is possibly someone near my physical location here who was hoping to intercept the packages between the time the mail runs and the time I check the mail. But, anyone in my neighborhood would have a pretty good idea that I work at home and I'm always shipping and receiving in real time and that I would probably be the worst possible candidate for such a scheme. 

Any ideas?",9,12,2016-02-15,EBAY,0.05244636908173561,0.9192772507667542,0.028276406228542328
Ebay,Should I ban this buyer?,"Im selling an expensive rare collectable on ebay. I had a user put a bid on it and when I looked him up, It said he has 25 bid retractions in the last 6 months which is a red flag to me. Several hours later he retracts his bid on my item but I think he's still watching it. He is rated a 50 at 100% but as a buyer that doesn't really mean much. I checked his feedback for other sellers and he left one negative that ebay had to remove his comment. The seller he left it for had an otherwise perfect rating so I contacted them to ask about this buyer. They said this buyer never read his terms, and didn't pay so they ended the auction and relisted and the buyer got really mad and made some derogatory comments that ebay had to remove but now his perfect rating was tainted by this user.

So my question is, would you ban this user to avoid a potential headache? I have a perfect rating also and my item has some important details about it's condition in the description and if he doesn't read them I can forsee a problem. It also a sealed and fragile item so I'm thinking my best move is to ban him. Am I being overly paranoid?",12,12,2016-02-15,EBAY,0.47891876101493835,0.4956456422805786,0.025435585528612137

Ebay,Had an issue going on for a few months and need advice,"So first off sorry for the wall of text but I'm just trying to describe the story as best as possible but it's kind of complicated but anyways two months ago I sold four brand new, sealed in the box LG G4's on eBay. Two buyers each bought two of the phones. The first buyer I've heard nothing from, he left positive feedback so I can only assume all is good, the second however has been a pain in my ass for the past two months. First he initiated a return request almost exactly one month after the auction ended saying the phone would not turn on, then 14 days later initiates another one saying the camera won't open and the WiFi keeps disconnecting, keep in mind these were brand new phones! So I accept the first one because there wasn't any other options but the second I disputed but eBay for some reason sided with the buyer so anyways I get one of the phones back (why he didn't ship them together, I don't know..) and it's supposedly the one that the camera doesn't open and surprise, surprise, this one won't turn on! but whatever I wait for the other one to come back to see if he mixed them up and after waiting a few weeks I check the tracking to see where the other phone was only to see that it was being shipped back to him after one delivery attempt, that I was unaware of at the time (I later found the USPS card after it was too late). So I send him a message saying, Hey USPS for some reason sent it back to you, could you please send it back. No response but I get a Paypal notification that a label was purchased so I assumed he was sending it back... A week and a half passes and then I message him asking if he had shipped it yet and received this reply back on the 14th, ""I'm sorry, I no longer have the phone. It didn't function anyway. It was a paper weight.""... So I messaged him back saying, ""That was not for you to decide.. The phone is my property and I need it back. What did you do with it?"" Sorry for the long story but I am just so angry about the whole mess, I'm not an eBay seller, I'm a college student who used the money I got for tuition and now eBay wants me to pay back this guy who I believe somehow ruined two brand new phones. Is there anything I can do to reverse the refunds or is too late since it's been dragged out two months after the auctions ended?

Ebay,"We've been forced to accept eBay's back-end bugs as ""normal"" because what choice do we have. But it's offensive and wasteful just how bad it is. Isn't there ANYthing we can do?","1.  Use turbolister to update shipping cost of 500 items.  TL removes 40% of images across 500 items.
  
2.  One solution is to use sell-similar from unsold, cannot change format from Auction to Fixed price as well as the duration -- Duration doesn't ""stick"" and must click ""Continue"", then go back and edit, then duration change can stick.

3.  Try to use file exchange to test for inventory integrity.  Last request over 24 hours old is still processing, cannot make new request.

4.  Try to export Active listings on TL for inventory check.  Export of active listings no longer supported.

6.  Try to copy ""Active"" section into the ""inventory"" section to use CSV export.  Crashes.

5.  Try to select and copy listings, then paste into excel.  Crashes.  Try to copy/paste 200 items at a time into excel, works at first, eventually degrades to crashing when copying even 10 lines at a time.  5 crashes it now.  Cannot finish.

Ebay,Buyer won't pay...,"Alright, so I had an auction for a drum. Person A bids on it. Person B outbids Person A. With 3 days left in the auction, Person B asks to cancel his bid. I look into it and comply since on of the reasons ebay lists to cancel bids is if the buyer requests.

So Person A is now the high bidder, and wins the drum at the listing price.

I hear nothing from the winner for several days despite my pleasant, formal inquiries. I open an unpaid item case. Here is where I likely made a mistake. I tracked him down on the internet with his name (very unique), and find a contact number for his wife. I call and very kindly and professionally ask her to inform her husband that he won my auction and to just get in contact with me through eBay.

He messages me through eBay later that day to say that he doesn't want the drum. Just wanting to end all of this I try to cancel the order, but can't because of the UPI case. The only way to close it is to wait for it to close automatically, or tell eBay that he paid. Well, I want my FVF back, so I can't do that.

Is there anything I can do such that he doesn't get a strike and I get my FVF? I feel kind of bad because he probably didn't know he won the item and could have moved on and bought a different drum thinking he had missed out on mine.

Any advise/input is appreciated!

Ebay,iPhone 6 plus selling issue.,"I don't run a store, I just sell spare stuff. I took advantage of the B1G1 T-Mobile promo and got an iPhone 6s. I sold my iPhone 6plus on eBay. The login name was kind of odd (Russian maybe?) but shipping was to NJ. Do what I usually do, charged normal shipping but then got insurance, signature on delivery, etc. I made sure to clear the iPhone before shipping it and sent it off Saturday. Buyer gets it on Tuesday and says the phone is locked. ""No big deal"", I probably forgot to turn off the iPhone tracking. Wrong, i go to iCloud its not there under my account anymore. Furthermore she is saying that it is locked to some bizarre yahoo email that I have never used. I bought the iPhone from an apple store day 1 and it still has applecare on it. I only used one apple ID which was a gmail address and never put anything else on it. I called apple and they can unlock it remotely which I am doing. She states that the phone was like that when she opened it, which is a blatant lie. I asked if it looks like it was messed with during shipping, to which she says no. Right now she is patiently waiting for Apple to unlock it remotely (I still have the receipt). I am fairly confident she is going to try and force a return and then ship me a bricked iPhone. Any ideas from people who may have run into similar situations?

Ebay,Two recent eBay issues - advice needed,"So I used to sell on eBay years ago and have just started again. I am a fairly inexperienced seller. I have two items that were sold recently that customers are giving me problems with.

Item one- facial cleanser and brush duo. In the description I said that the box was damaged however the item has never been used and the safety seal on the cleanser bottle is intact, which it in fact was. The customer is saying that when received the safety seal was open, the cleanser had oozed all over the box and that the box was opened( pictures I took showed the box in fact opened and damaged). I do not want to honor this return as I think the customers complaints are invalid and I think the customer opened the cleanser and actually used it, didn't like it and now is looking to get their money back. What should I do?

Also, I sold a Tiffany and Co. Ceramic piggy bank. This item is vintage. I've brought this to a Tiffany store when I acquired it years ago and due to its age, they were unable to provide me with any paperwork however they said because of the nature of this item it highly likely to be authentic. For context, this item sold for $20. The customer is asking for a refund(not requesting a return). Claiming that the item is not authentic. I posted many pictures from different angles to show all stamping on the item. Also this post clearly states no returns accepted.

I'm worried that if I don't bite the bullet and take these items back, I will incur negative feedback. For a novice ebayer like myself with a feedback score of 49(100% positive) this would really hurt my account. Any advice would be much appreciated. Forgive the formatting as I'm posting on mobile.

Edit: in regards to the Tiffany Bank. I told the buyer to start a return request and I would honor it despite the ""no returns accepted"".

Ebay,Need Help: Feel Like I'm Getting Scammed by a Buyer,"I sold this woman a Vizio 28'' Smart TV a few weeks ago. Since then, she first complained that I sent her the wrong power cord, which I'm almost certain I didn't.

Here's the problem: As much as I want to just throw up my arms and just tell her to return it, I realize how much that will screw me financially. Not only do I have to give her back the $120 for the TV, but as the seller I also have to pay for shipping, which will be really expensive. 




As the seller, do I have any protection against this sort of thing? It seems like she's just coming up with excuses to get me to pay her more money or something.

Ebay,Long story ahead. Does a ring engraved with a quote from a mass murderer count as a violation of eBay's policy on true crime memorabilia?,"My cousin's school had an ultra-religious abstinence group come in to teach ""health"" class and they had to purchase purity rings for class credit. The class was told they could have whatever they want engraved on them as long as it mentioned purity, chastity, love, etc. So, my cousin and a dozen or so other kids got rings engraved with a quote from Dylan Klebold, (for those of you who don't know he was one of the Columbine gunmen) ""Love is more valuable than anything I know. To love is to enter a completion of oneself."" on the outside, complete with attribution, as a form of protest because the Health teacher was reading the rings to verify they didn't have obscenities or anything on them. (The kids who wore the ones with the quote on them were sent home and suspended despite the inscription not containing any profanity, threats, or slurs; some of the parents are now suing under the *Tinker v. Des Moines* and *Gilman v. Holmes County* precedents, but I digress.)

My question is that if after these kids are done with the protest, they want to sell the rings and donate the money to the ACLU to keep this from happening at another school because the religious group said some very horrible and untrue things about women, sexual assault, and the LGBT community as well as being blatantly Christian preaching at a public school.

Ebay,Need an opinion on a return / abuse of returns....,"Just need a tip as surprisingly I have very few situations like this now that we aren't having returns jammed at us like they have been in the past. 

Buyer opens a return, stating the item (new with tags / actual photos shown) has a stain. It arrives today, definitely no stain. It's a heavy sweater, weather is getting warmer - you get the idea... abuse of returns to get free shipping back to me. 

I did drop the buyer a nice message with unedited photos just taken asking for help to location the stain. 

What have you been doing with situations like this? The sweater was $13.50. Shipping paid was $8.15 for USPS Priority mail (actual cost - heavy big/tall sweater). Plus unless I debate it, I am out return shipping too. IMHO the buyer deserves $13.50 and no more... it's perfect so no reason to charge restocking. Before I call eBay, I'd appreciate your opinion.

Ebay,Question re: Global Shipping and seller obligations.,"I shipped an item to a buyer in the UK via Global Shipping. As per detailed tracking information, the package arrived safely at the sorting facility in Kentucky then went on to be delivered to the customer who claims the package arrived compromised and empty. 

He's attempting to 'return' the item and requesting a refund. 

I've told them to contact Global Shipping and provided a link to the page to file a claim but no response and I have this lingering return.

Ebay,"Filed shipping claim, seller says he will wait until he hears from shipper to refund. Help?","Hello,

I purchased a ""New - Other"" TV and it arrived damaged. I immediately requested a return and refund through ebay. The seller contacted me saying he could give me $80 back and I should take it up with Samsung. Samsung said take it up with shipper UPS. I told seller all this and asked to return item entirely and get a full refund. He didn't respond.

I did what Samsung recommended, filed a claim with UPS, and informed the seller. The seller then responded and said he will wait until he hears from UPS to refund my money. This could take up to 10 days. And the seller didn't bother asking for the TV back so I have to keep in it my apt all those 10 days too until UPS picks it up for inspection.

What should I do? I already feel like I went out of my way to file the claim.

Ebay,Need help ASAP!,"Hello!
I'm wondering if anyone here can be of help. 
Today I sold a pair of rare trainers at £730 on eBay. I received a notification from eBay saying the buyer had payed, and an email from service@PayPal.co.uk stating that the transaction has been pending and that to receive it faster I need to ship it with a tracking number etc. This immediately alarmed me as I had sold the item through eBay's global shipping scheme, to the account which I thought was in the US. EBay then messaged me telling me the process of sending etc. Then, once receiving the email of payment and notification from eBay, I noticed the address was now a London address. I messaged the buyer and he said he lives between California and the US. He then sent me a further message asking if I could send it tomorrow as he would like to receive it for his birthday lol 
Anyway, I have no idea why the money is pending due to having been an eBay member for years and years and having sold a very similar item for £500 just a couple months ago and that going through fine!
I really don't want to send them whilst the transaction is pending and I sense something very fishy. If anyone could help I would be very great-full.

Ebay,2 non-paying bidders this week for computer parts,"Hi! 

I am an infrequent Ebayer, but probably have 200 transactions going back to the early 2000s across multiple accounts. 75% selling, 25% buying.

I haven't sold a lot recently, but last week I posted some computer parts (RAM, CPU, GPU) and 2 of them were sold to non-paying/non-communicating people, and the other received 5 messages from some kid begging me to lower the price.

Is this a strange coincidence, or do PC parts attract sketchy people? Curious because I was considering parting out brand new computer worth several thousand dollars. I'm also slightly concerned about fraud (i.e. ebayer buying my expensive processor and returning a fake, etc).

Ebay,Is there any chance that eBay will start getting their shipping charges correct soon?,"I planned on printing postage for four sales tonight. One was a medium flat rate box. eBay charged the customer $12.65, the old rate for that box. With the eBay discount I was still coming in under the charged postage so went ahead and printed it. I then went to print postage for a 9x11 envelope that weighed 3 oz. I had sold it ""Free Shipping"" anticipating a charge of about a buck and a half. eBay wants me to pay nearly $3! To see if I was just crazy I went to the USPS postage calculator and punched in the numbers. I was right. They showed a shipping cost of $1.54. 

This has been going on since the new rates went into effect. I usually have enough margin to eat the difference but it really sucks that on top of fees (which I am not bitching about at all) I have to pay for their inability to set up an effective postal calculator with plenty of advance notice. There's also no resource for complaint about this except going through the tedious process of actually calling in and speaking to someone who will not be able to do a damn thing about the problem except to say that they're ""very sorry for any confusion and they're working hard to fix any issues that may or may not be occurring.""",2,2,2016-02-21,EBAY,0.08115465193986893,0.8867195248603821,0.032125797122716904

Ebay,What are my chances of getting scammed and losing the case if I follow these steps?,"I've sold small things before (worth $25 or less) so I never had any concern about getting scammed nor have I been scammed from it on EBay.  However, lately I feel like I need some extra money for college and my part time job isn't supplying enough money for me to do so.  I'm planning on selling 2 items that are completely brand new (sealed) and are most likely worth $300 each.  I've heard so many awful stories of people getting scammed for over thousands of dollars and I'm really paranoid about catching one of those scammers from selling these two items.  I did some research and I was wondering what are my chances of getting scammed and losing the case if I did these things:



-sell only to buyers with confirmed paypal accounts



-sell only to buyers with 50 or more feedback with at least 99% or higher (making sure that they did not accumulate a bunch of neg feedbacks recently)



-make sure to ship only to their confirmed paypal address and nowhere else, regardless of what address the buyer asks you to ship



-communicate through EBay message system ONLY and NEVER give out your paypal e-mail



-don't ship anything out until Paypal clears the payment



-don't sell to anybody outside of North America



-always include tracking and possibly get insurance



-never accept anybody who tries to offer a significantly higher amount than what you are trying to sell for



-never do partial refunds and only do a full refund once you get your item back with everything intact




If I do all of these things, are my chances of getting scammed and losing my money incredibly low?  Are there any other crucial things I should do to increase my chances of selling these two items successfully?

Ebay,Interesting Ebay/Paypal Claim. Need your thoughts.,"A couple weeks ago I sold an antique globe for $700.  After the purchase the buyer changed his address from California to China.  I don't ship out of the country, I reported the buyer for non-payment so I wouldn't be charged the selling fee.

I later relisted the item and it was purchased by another Chinese buyer, but this time located in Boston.  I packed it up and shipped it out and two days later I see an ""Item not as described"" charge back on Paypal.

I offer hassle free returns on eBay.  I also purchased insurance on the item, I would have taken a return no questions asked, but it still would have been nice if the buyer contacted me.

On the paypal claim the buyer stated that the cast iron base was broken and had been repaired (which it wasn't).  Confused as to why the buyer would just open a claim on paypal and not ebay when I offer returns, I decided to contact the buyer......

A few minutes later I realized I contacted the wrong buyer.  I accidentally sent a message to the first buyer who had never paid for the item.  To my surprise they replied saying the the cast iron base was broken.  I sent him a few more messages and he replied to them as well, I asked for a picture and he haven't responded yet.

So the buyer who didn't pay for the item and then the second buyer are clearly the same person.  To top it off I have messages from the first buyer asking me questions about the globe and stating that they he had purchased a similar globe to mine in the past.

Ebay,"Buyer demanding refund over a year after sale, do they have any way of forcing a return?","In December 2014 when I was just starting out as a seller, I got my first buyer from Puerto Rico, a bracelet. The lady bought it Saturday night, and on Monday morning I had my very first negative for not having a tracking number uploaded, despite my listing saying 3 day handling time. After denying to change it after giving her the tracking number and moving her order ahead of others, she gave me the pleasure of forcing me to go through customer support for ebay for the first time to remove the negative. I sent her the bracelet and thought that was the end of it. 

Until a week ago she sends me an email, not an eBay message, demanding a refund and that she'll open an eBay case, a PayPal case, and leave me negative feedback again if I don't comply. I know that the 60 days for any sort of dispute are long gone, so I ignore it.

Today, I get another email. My Spanish is a litle rusty, but they're saying I have 24 hours to return the money, and then they will send it back. And that if I don't agree they will ""denounce"" me on eBay. She then also mentions her son is a sherrif in my state and there will be consequences if I don't comply. 

So what do you guys think, does she have any legal recourse after so long? Is it possible she or a family member buys something else just to leave a negative feedback? Is she just bluffing?

Ebay,Buyer is claiming PayPal is broken and wants a cancellation.

Is there any way for the buyer to request a cancellation now that it's been more than an hour? How about an unpaid item claim? Basically I want to do whatever doesn't give the buyer a loophole to leave negative feedback, because even though I have proof that the buyer is the one that cancelled, I really want to avoid eBay's customer service at all costs.

Side note: Even if they could pay, I'm wary of sending them the card because this buyer sent up a ton of red flags with that first message (I heard: ""I'm going to break this card and claim you sent me something that doesn't work""). But just out of curiosity, is it actually possible for Paypal to prevent an account for paying? I thought they only held funds, not stopped buyers from paying.

So ebay is claiming since purchases were made from the same ID, they are not fraudulent. I hope paypal sides with me on this, but I think they will claim the same. I just dont know what to do...

Ebay,"Update: Fraudulent paypal claim Antique Globe. I won, so what now?","So last week I sold a Globe for $700.  Previously a buyer located in China won the item, I don't ship to China and I refused to sell the item. I don't even allow international bidders to bid on my items, the buyer had changed his address to bid on the item and then once winning changed it back to a Chinese address.

The item later sold to another Chinese buyer, this time located in Boston.  I shipped the item and soon after a claim was filed on Paypal.

Through an accidental stroke of luck it was discovered that buyer #1 and #2 were the same person.  I refused the refund.  I called Paypal twice, the first time the support agent didn't speak English very well and wasn't all that helpful.  Later the buyer proposed a $100 partial refund, I called paypal again.

This time I got an American support agent.  He looked at the evidence and despite not being an expert on Globes could see that the pictures submitted from the buyer (the buyer refused to send me pictures) were of a completely different globe.

The case was closed and decided in my favor on the spot (thanks paypal).

However winning the case is simply not enough for me. I'm absolutely tired of these scammers with no morals being able to attempt these scams risk free.  Best case they get their money back, worst case they get the item they paid for, doesn't seem fair to me.

I live about 30 miles from Boston were the buyer is located and I'm thinking I want to either file a police report, take them to small claims court, or both.

What is the best way to go about doing this?",7,8,2016-02-24,EBAY,0.0560617670416832,0.9104927182197571,0.03344549238681793

Ebay,Why do sellers set reserve prices instead of minimum bids?,"I am new to ebay as a buyer so I am a bit confused why this is done.

It's doubly annoying because I was trying to buy a fairly inexpensive lot of used electronic items (2DS with some games installed and 2 physical games) and put in a bid for half the price the items are worth individually new, and yet still have not reached the seller's reserve price.  Why not just set the minimum bid at a bit less than the ""buy it now"" price instead of utilizing this reserve option? Then I wouldn't waste my time stabbing in the dark until reaching my limit on what I am willing to pay.

Ebay,"Shipped known-working item, buyer said it didn't work and proceeded to unsolder wires inside. Do I need to honor a return request?","Hey guys,

I’m not sure how to handle this.  I sold a guitar pedal on ebay last week and shipped it out on Monday.  Last night, I received an email that the pedal didn’t work.

I know it worked as I tested it before I send it out.  Unfortunately, I didn’t take any video of it working (lesson learned).

I replied asking the user to try pressing hard on the switch as sometimes it takes a good amount of force to engage the swithc (it’s a foot pedal after all).

He replied saying that he “unsoldered the wires and grounded them and it worked but (he) thinks the switch is shot.”

Now… I know it worked before I shipped it.  He, through eBay messages, said that he actually unsoldered the inner workings and screwed with it.

He hasn’t filed a claim for return yet but, if he does, am I obligated to return it even after he screwed with the internals of the device?  How can I be sure that it’ll work when I get it back?

Ebay,Received a defect for a typo on an invoice,"This is not a rant but an attempt to reach out to the community to see if there is another way to possibly appeal the defect.

I've been a seller on eBay for close to 4 years averaging 300 transactions monthly across two seller accounts.  For the most part, my experience has been positive with frustrating buyers being the exception and not the norm.

Recently, a buyer opened a return request stating I sent the wrong item.  In my replies to these types of requests, I ask the buyer if they received what was pictured in the listing, or if they received something other than what is pictured so I can check up on the transactions in case shipping labels were switched, for example.  What stood out was the buyer knew they received something wrong because what they received was for a completely different application.  But how did she know that? 

I checked the invoice for the buyer, and the problem was I typed a 5 instead of 6 and I included in my reply that if the reason for opening the request was due to the invoice, that it was all a misunderstanding and a typo.  Since the buyer never replied to my response, I left it alone and figured they checked the pictures in the listing and saw that what they received matched the pictures.

I moved on with business until the buyer escalated the case a few days later, which was decided against us.  After receiving the return from the buyer, which was definitely what was pictured in the listing, I attempted to appeal the decision with eBay since we made every attempt, short of calling the buyer herself, to work with the buyer.  As a last resort, I asked if they could remove the defect as a courtesy since we are essentially being punished for a typo on the invoice.  I don't feel it's an unreasonable request, but it feels like I'm missing something here which is why I'm reaching out to the community.  If I attempt to appeal the decision again, how should I frame it?",4,5,2016-02-27,EBAY,0.18355046212673187,0.7837506532669067,0.0326988622546196

I like the appeal of eBays ""Out of stock"" option as it means it would be easier to re-list items whenever I need too and would save time.

However, there is one thing which is bugging me. It says in the ""Out of stock"" area of eBay ""Selling fees will be added when the item is relisted"". So to clarify, does that mean I'd still be getting charged if I did an out of stock option? Or can I just do it on all of my products as I don't pay listing fees anyway.

It's quite vague wording as selling fees are when an item has sold. I am being a bit picky here but basically I don't want to enable the option and then find out I owe eBay double fees for instance. Could anyone clarify?

Ebay,"Broken Saddle, damaged in shipping, buyer wants refund of repair.","I sold a saddle on Ebay and shipped it thru UPS. 3 days after the buyer received it, he contacts me to let me know he was just then trying it out on his horse and seen it had a brace that was broken.

I contacted the UPS store I sent it from to see how to start a claim. They sent a rep out to inspect the saddle but buyer had already threw the box away and they needed the box to inspect it for the claim. 

UPS cannot do any claim because they needed the box and it was already thrown out. Now the buyer has given me an ultimatum; I can  either refund him $60 for the repair cost (which he's been given an estimate on) or he said he will go through Ebay and Paypal, send the saddle back to me (I have to pay for shipping) and he gets a refund.

Can the buyer request a refund through eBay?
I sent the saddle in perfect condition and I have pictures to prove it.

He wants me to put up WoW Lootcards. He told me he is going to talk to the highest bidder to make sure everything will go smoothly, and that the payments will go through family &amp; friends, so that the winner of the auction can't get the money back after recieving the card.

Ebay,Sold iPhone- Buyer wants IMEI,"I've sold a few of my old iPhones on ebay in the past after I upgrade to the newest model, and have never had an issue.  However, recently, I listed and sold an iPhone 4.  Immediately after the auction closed, the winning bidder started peppering me with emails asking to provide the IMEI number before he would pay for the item.  After doing a little research online I couldn't find a definitive answer if I should provide that or not.  I told him I was not comfortable doing that, but would provide it after payment.  He has sent me 10+ emails in the past day demanding that number.  Finally, I verified the IMEI online myself and sent him the message I received that it was not stolen.  I told him that if he did not pay, I would open up a resolution on the item.  He recently sent me this message: 

""I can also contact eBay and inform them that you are hiding information from the buyers so it is impossible to do on eBay how do I know that the phone is not stolen or lost and you found you really complicate your life today, I bought my daughter a 4S phone and the seller did not conceal information from buyers I can provide you with the item number of the phone that I bought and please look at all the pictures of TM in the photos shows the IMEI number of the phone 291690411250 find on this item of the room telephone on eBay which I already bought""

Ebay,Need Advice: I think the buyer damaged the item.,"They recieved the phone case in the mail yesterday. It's a phone case with dangle-y tassels hanging off by a chain. They messaged me that it (the chains) broke later AFTER they put it on their phone. I am not responsible for rough wear and tear, though I know ebay won't see it my way. How do I make a case? The buyer DID put the phone case on their phone undamaged. They admitted to it. It's a frou-frou-type case with fur. Not made to protect the phone. Here's a photo: http://i.imgur.com/u8GhfzL.jpg EDIT:  I've sold plenty of these and have never had a complaint.

UPDATED 

Me:  I'm sorry that your item broke after you put it on your phone. I do not, however, offer warranties on my products, cover buyer damage or alteration and therefore cannot offer a refund on the case. 

If you'd like a replacement case, I will be happy to sell you one at a discount of $6.99 with free shipping 


Them: but you send me an item that was damage

Them:  Take a good look at this tinsel it was already broke and it haven't even been two days something needs to be done or I'll just contact eBay and send them these pictures for a refund because what you're telling me is ridiculous you're (I'm what ...?)

Ebay,Seller wants my phone number regarding return.,"Okay, so I bought an item on eBay. Before buying I asked the seller via PM if it had any damage and they said no. Upon receiving I noticed it has the exact type of damage that I asked about. 

Obviously I started a return request. 

Seller is now saying that the damage is fair because of the age of the item (even though none of the listing photos shown the damage and they specifically told me it was undamaged) and they now want my phone number to talk about it. 

I don't feel comfortable giving them my phone number as they could easily try to intimidate me into dropping the return request and I'd have no proof (if they tried threats via PM obviously eBay could read it, not so with a phone call). Are they even allowed to ask for my phone number?
