Ebay,Received secondhand goods not as described - how good is eBay / PayPal protection?,"Hi there,

I've been using eBay for several years, not in high volumes, but any problems I've ever had in the past have always been rectified very quickly and easily. Although it's not a lot of money, this is the first time I'm getting a bit of a ""red flag"" feeling about a purchase.

So last week I won an auction for a complete set of ""The Blues Collection"", which was a magazine + CD which were published here in the UK about 15 years ago. It covered a different artist each month (more info: [1](http://www.discogs.com/lists/The-Blues-Collection/25834) [2](http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=314578)) and the auction listing was for the full set of 90 CDs and for their accompanying magazines.

The seller was new to eBay, zero feedback, and had a bit of a communications failure when I asked her a question before the auction closed, but the price was good so I thought I'd take a chance. I paid by PayPal.

So the seller wasn't very chatty after the transaction, either, but about 4 days later two boxes turned up on my doorstep and all the CDs are there, in good condition. The condition of the magazines is OK, too, but there are two missing.

So with the two magazines missing this isn't a complete collection (as was advertised), and I rather feel the two magazines are going to be impossible to get hold of individually. You'll see the CDs themselves all the time on local fleamarkets and on eBay, and they sell for 50p to £2 each, but hardly ever the with the magazines, not unless they're being sold as a complete set like I bid on. I found 6 with the magazines on eBay's completed listings for £5 - £7.50 each, but of course none of them are the ones I'm looking for.

I have sent the seller a ""goods not as described"" message and asked ""do you think you'll be able to find the missing issues?"", but I'm sure she won't be able to - the markings on the boxes suggest they were packed up since a house move. It's only been 36 hours, but judging from her communications so far I have a feeling she's going to stick her head in the sand and ignore me, at least until I file a complaint with eBay.

The cost of shipping these back to her would be expensive, and I'd be happy with a partial refund of the price I paid. I'll keep an eye on eBay and see if I can manage to pick up the missing issues eventually.

* How helpful are eBay / PayPal likely to be, please? I think I may have read that their protection is less encompassing for secondhand goods - is this true? She seems to have accidentally marked the condition as ""new"" when she listed the items. Does this work in my favour?

* What should my first step be if she doesn't respond within the next day or so? File a claim with eBay or with PayPal?

* Any other strategies I should know about for dealing with eBay? Should I tell them I'd be happy with a partial refund, or should I describe ""the item is broken"", ask for the whole amount to be refunded and wait to see if she counter-offers, or something? 

Thanks in advance for any advice.",3,2,2011-07-04,EBAY,0.05311760678887367,0.9162154197692871,0.030667005106806755

Ebay,How badly have I messed up? Where do I stand?,"I sold a copy of Microsoft Flight Simulator: Deluxe Edition, and used Ebay's automatic picture suggestion without checking it (I accept this is my own lazy fault, for sure). It turns out the picture was a copy of MFS: Gold Edition - which is the next one up. It did say in the description and the title that this was Deluxe Edition, and I described the features of Deluxe, but not those of Gold. 

The game sold, but the buyer has contacted me through Ebay saying he's dissappointed that it was a copy of Deluxe Edition, not Gold Edition. He wants to return it to me and has offered to pay for the postage to do so, however, on the description it does say that I don't accept returns. 

So, I'm wondering, what are my rights here? What am I obligated to do? I have mentioned to the buyer that he was free to contact me before he placed a bid, which he accepts. Would somebody with more Ebay experience be willing to advise me here?",9,1,2011-07-05,EBAY,0.021483590826392174,0.9263942241668701,0.05212222412228584

This is the first time the buyer has ever messaged me, and I have never messaged him. The ""case details"" are lies. I sent this in response:

""This (this notification of an open case) is the first time the buyer has ever contacted me, and I have never contacted the buyer. eBay Customer support can see through my message history to verify this. -I have never sent the buyer a message (let alone a ""massage"", as I am not a licensed Masseuse) regarding anything. -I have

Ebay,"Outside of feedback revision, what can you do about buyers who leave negative feedback in haste when selling digital items","Recently,i've sold over 4,000 misc digital items.  What i've found is people hastily leaving feedback when they don't understand how to use something, accidentally delete the email, don't get it, or it ends up in spam folder.  I've only had it happen 10 times and nearly all were resolvable.  I've sent feedback adjustments to a handful, but ebay has capped me at 5 total because people simply don't leave feedback enough to get you another 5 revisions.   Ebay claims they don't want you handling the problem afterwards , but in these rare cases where you are selling a digital item it's literally impossible to know if there is a problem.

TL;DR Are there any other way to get more feedback revisions when the buyer/seller are in agreement that the feedback was left incorrectly or in haste.",2,2,2011-07-14,EBAY,0.42234015464782715,0.5540773272514343,0.02358251065015793

Ebay,"Getting ripped off by Chinese buyer, help!","About two weeks ago, I sold two camera lenses to a Chinese buyer, and was gracious enough to ship to him even though the listing specifically said that I ship only to the U.S.

Besides that, he took a week to ""sort things out with Paypal"" before he could send payment and cost of shipping.

The lens in question is [here](http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=110711282799). A few days ago, he messaged me saying that the aperture blades are broken. The pictures I took of the lens show that they are obviously in perfect working condition, both closed and open. My first thoughts were that the box was damaged in shipment, but the buyer responded that there is no damage to the box.

Now, he went and got a quote for the repairs, which he said were $50. However, he has asked for a $70 refund for the lens, because he believes it is different than the description. He even sent me [these](http://www.camgle.com/viewthread.php?tid=229109&amp;pid=3142957&amp;page=1&amp;extra=) pictures as proof, although I can't read what anything says.
