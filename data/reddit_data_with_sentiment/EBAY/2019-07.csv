Ebay,How am I being charged for shipping label printed in eBay (not PayPal)?,"I'm trying to find out how I'm being charged for the shipping label I printed for an auction, through eBay. 

Right now in ""Account Settings"" in the list of fees, I only see the final auction fee, as well as the shipping fee (a % of the shipping cost that the auction winner paid), but no amount showing the cost of the shipping label itself (roughly $45). 

I looked at my PayPal, which is already tied to my eBay account, see the payment by winner for the item and the shipping cost. I only see fees for PayPal transaction. No subtractions (charges) for the shipping label either.

Ebay,Buyer claims wrong item sent,"I know this is a common scam and is the first time in my 5 years as a seller I have had it happen to me. I sold a satellite radio receiver with boombox for $200. The buyer opened a return with pictures stating that I sent the wrong item. The pictures provided by the buyer are of a boombox and receiver of a completely different make/model. I immediately contacted eBay by phone, they informed me that I should first report the buyer, then contact them to see if it is possible they purchased more than 1 item and are mixing up sellers/items. Ebay rep basically told me I will have to bend over and take the return and send a refund. I said the buyer can send me a box of rocks back and there is noting I can do about it. Ebay rep said I can appeal but I won't have any proof. How does eBay still let buyers get away with this? I thought there were supposed to be more seller protections against things like this.

Ebay,"Sold a bunch of my old Lego, listed as incomplete, buyer wants to return as it's incomplete","So I basically had some old Lego sets that I wanted to shift to free up some cash. I build the ones I'm sure are complete, print lists of all pieces etc etc and they're fine. I have some other Lego star wars stuff that I know is incomplete and lump it in with the complete stuff. Make a long detailed description of what's included and what's incomplete. I list it at a cheaper rate (complete would be worth £350-£500) with a long description including pictures of everything and it sells for about £250, which is around what I thought.

Of course I forgot to un-check Global shipping and someone from Finland has bought this bulk lot. (D'oh)

Manage to get it to global shipping who then separate the one box themselves into 2 boxes.

Takes an age to get to Finland and at one point the customer claims item not received. That's resolved.

Then he says there's parts missing from some of the models (well yeh, that's what I clearly described).

Of course he then goes radio silent when I ask for more detail, what's missing, from which sets?

So I escalate to Ebay support saying his claiming it's incomplete when the description clearly states not all models are complete, some missing sub-assemblies etc. Of course after 10 minutes with their ""specialist team"" they side with the buyer stating the reason as ""I trust that you post the item in good faith but I hope you can understand that there is no way for us to see the actual condition of the item when it was shipped to the buyer. However, we believe that as a good customer service to your buyer, it is the seller’s responsibility to ensure that the item will arrive in the condition they’ve expected from your listing."". Generic

So here lies the issue. I somehow have to get it from Finland to the UK at probable extortionate rates from a buyer who hasn't said anything to me since opening the case. I've been trying to find info on this but I've become stuck in a maze of global shipping terms, eBay money back guarantee and Paypal buyer protection. Do Ebay automatically refund the buyer prior to the item being returned? Am I expected to pay for return shipping or does the buyer ship it back and I refund their shipping costs?

**tl;dr:** Sold big item, forgot to uncheck global shipping, sale goes wrong, how do I get my item back?

Update: I won! So after the decision going against me I had a look around various order pages for the item and I found that **only 1 of 2 packages had been delivered** by global shipping. These are the original box I sent them split into 2 packages. So I got on to eBay chat and they did whatever they do and voila, they change their minds, rule in both our favours. I keep the original payment, eBay refunds the customer from their own pocket and some guy in Finland now has a bunch of free Lego.",23,18,2019-07-02,EBAY,0.07048290222883224,0.902422308921814,0.027094777673482895

Ebay,Sellers: how do you have the patience to deal with this abuse?,"I've been using ebay for over a decade now but never sold anything until last month and this has to be by far the most painful, excruciating and abusive experience on whole world wide web. Ebay has to be the worst big company I've experienced.

How do you people manage to stick around? 

I put my item for sale, which apparently I can't do because I have ""allowance"" when there's no indication how much is that allowance? To raise it I have to have a international phone call? What year is this?  
Alright so I got passed the allowance thing with plentiful googling and reducing my starting prices.  
Next I need to double check my draft - there are little mine fields everywhere. You want subtitle? Well that's $10 etc. etc.  

Finally I listed my item. Day passes and I'm starting to get bombarded with low ball offers to the point where I start believing my item is not worth the asking price. I did a bit of analytic research and I was selling _below_ market value by 20-30%.  

I have few bids and the auction is about to run out - I'm quite happy with my current price. So some guy snipes the auction and immediately messages me asking for a refund. Anyway ebay sides with the guy and I refund him. 

Here's the kicker though - ebay considers item as ""sold"" even-though it is refunded. Remember that allowance thing? Well now I have to wait for next month to relist my item lol.  

Luckily I only had to wait few days. I relist my item - this time only with buy now price. Few hours later I'm getting a message - your account and listings were suspended - that's it. Literally no other information other than ""click help on the website"" - what the actual fuck? How is this multi-billion dollar company is so absolutely incompetent in UX? Oh and here's the best part - they still charged me all of the listing fees.

Anyway there's no way to restore an account and the only option I have is sending email to ebay hoping they restore my account. I'm willing to take this issue with my bank and I'm never using this absolute hot garbage of a system again. 

After this experience I have nothing but respect for ebay sellers - this sort of dark-pattern filled abusive bureaucracy is really mind-blowing.",10,8,2019-07-02,EBAY,0.059016112238168716,0.9097110033035278,0.03127286955714226

Ebay,Does anyone know what is up with eBay currency conversions and are there tips to avoid being deceived ?,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a living in France and in the past two months I have made several purchases on eBay from sellers located in the UK and the USA.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I saw a nice book set of great value from a seller in the UK, listed for 450£ and 29£ for the delivery. I decided to make an offer at 400£. At the moment of sending the offer, eBay tells me that if the seller accepts my offer the total amount will be 429£ (400 + 29), corresponding to 480€. Some time later, the seller accepts my offer, I receive a confirmation email, and suddenly 429£ correspond to 501€ ! A few days later my bank account was debited : 479€ for the seller and 24€ for eBay International Shipping service, 503€ total. What the hell ?! As of right now, 429£ correspond to 478.43€.

&amp;#x200B;

This has happened to me for almost all of my purchases, but the other items I bought were much less expensive so the difference were just 2 or 3€.

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like eBay gives the real exchange rate when making the offer but once the offer is accepted, they apply a currency change fee. Is it what it is ? If so it is not indicated at the time you make an offer. Is there a way to avoid this ? I would be thankful for any insight since I am new to eBay.",10,7,2019-07-04,EBAY,0.02491844817996025,0.9225370287895203,0.052544523030519485

I sold a VR headset via the GSP programme.  Had an email today saying it is restricted so buyer would be refunded, they (GSP) would keep the item and I would keep original purchase funds!

Ebay,Handling time definitely affects sales,"I guess this post is more of an FYI then anything.

My store is TRS and fast and free. I got about 20 to 30 sales a day. About a year-and-a-half ago I had to do a business trip so I shut down the store completely hiding the listings. It took 2 months to recover once I came back.

From everything I read the best course of action is to not put your store on vacation and just extend the handling time.

So, I'm in the process of moving to a bigger Warehouse and extend my handling time to 5 days rather than shutting down the store.

I just find it amazing the drop in sales by just changing your handling time from one day to 5. It's about 90%. I'm doing a little research experiment though. In about a week I'll be fully moved into the new facility and change it back to one day shipping and handling

I'm just wondering how long it'll take once I go back to one day to start seeing 20 to 30 sales a day again. From spot checking it looks like several my top selling listings are still in top place, but the order volume has cut down a lot.

Ebay,Buyer keeps buying,"I just recently started selling and I'm not sure what to do with this particular buyer. She's a nice woman and is bidding and winning a lot of my items. She has 100% positive feedback and it looks like she often buys repeatedly from the same seller, and she is helping to bid up my items as well so all's good right? Problem is every time I think she is finished buying and is ready to pay, she bids on another item that won't end for another 6 days. The first item ended on the 29th of June, and the last item (so far) that she has bid on will end on the 9th of July. I even stopped listing items that she might bid on until after the last item ends just to keep her from bidding on even more.

&amp;#x200B;

My conundrum is, if I offend her, I might lose a very prolific buyer. Some of the items she has bought might not sell any time soon if it weren't for her, but other items I might have already been paid for. This isn't new from this buyer since she routinely buys many items from the same seller and she has all positive feedback. She has been communicating fine with me, but now she seems to want to talk off of eBay and I told her I could get in trouble and I can't talk outside of eBay while she has active bids on my items. I mean, great that she is buying, but I am sitting on a lot of ending item fees from eBay but haven't been paid yet.

&amp;#x200B;

She also bought two heavy books and I suggested we send those separately through media mail so it saves her some money on shipping. and she agreed, paid for the books and now she doesn't want me to ship them until the other items are sent because she is going out of town. I already printed out the label since she paid for those, but am I going to get in trouble with eBay because I haven't sent them?

I'm confused. I never thought I would be unhappy because someone buys my items.

I just got a returned package on Wednesday, July 3rd that I sent out on January 26th. The buyer never mentioned anything and hasn't messaged or asked for a refund. I think USPS did not deliver it since the buyer's address changed and they had moved or something while the order and delivery was processing.

I read that eBay policy is report an undelivered package within 30 days after expected delivery date and that is long gone now about four months ago.

Should I just keep the money from the original sale and sell it again? Or contact eBay or the buyer? Never had this happen before and want to sell the item again but don't want to leave a customer hanging and get abad review.

Ebay,Tips for selling electronics/technology?,"So I'm a pretty new seller still getting my feet wet in the world of eBay. I'm trying to sell two action cameras (one's a go pro, one's a Yi 4K+) and some of my accessories (likely going to sell them in two lots, one with the go pro, one with the Yi 4K+ and the accessories that go with it).

My issue is that as I imagine, scamming is definitely an issue on the site. So what are ways that I can ensure that I don't get scammed and that the buyer feels safe in buying from me (I don't have much feedback as I am brand new). This is probably around 500 dollars in equipment so I really want to make sure I don't get scammed here. I did some research and some websites/youtube channels talked about posting a picture of the serial number? But is there any way I can also prevent someone from ""not paying"" or getting their money back after I shipped the product already. Sorry if these are dumb questions lol I'm really new to this.

Also, with shipping, what is the best way to make sure everything gets to the seller intact, but is also relatively economical. Obviously, I can't just put the camera in a flat rate box and ship it. Basically, what's the most common way people ship cameras/technology or just fragile items in general at a cheap price?

Ebay,Buyer claiming new LEGOS set was opened and resealed,"I recently sold a brand new LEGOS set, the buyer pays almost immediately and everything goes fine. Today the buyer receives the package and messages me claiming that the little strips of tape on the side of the box were scotch tape and that the package had been open before. (as many of us know most small to medium size LEGO sets come with 2 strips of thin tape of each side to seal the ends closed). I communicated this to the buyer and let them know as far as i know that item has never been opened seeing as it came right off the shelf. The buyer then messages me stating that they opened the package and were confused by the numbering on the baggies that hold the building bricks and figures) they also state that they can send me photos proving that the package had been open prior to its arrival. 

So I have 3 issues with this:

1.I take pictures of the items i sell before i ship them out proving nothing has changed since the listing photos were taken.

2.The buyer is stating they can prove the package was opened prior yet in the message before that admitted to opening the packaging to look inside.

3. Last but not least they claimed the item was a gift for someone....

My brother was asked to trash them, but instead squirreled away everything in his garage and asked me if I could sell them online to make a profit. I don't know a lot about lighting fixtures or how to go about selling them online. But, there is easily $5k with of fixtures (at least 50 or so) and tons of bulbs. Most are in the original box, some are open and hooked up with regular wall outlet plugs to use as floor models, and some even come with carrying bags (I'm assuming for sales reps to bring to clients). I know a few of the halogen bulbs in boxes I have sell for 30-50 each new (and I have about 30). Some of the parking lot lights sell for 400-500 new. I know they are not new and open box, but I figured since they were free for me, even asking for %30-%40 of the original price would net me a nice profit, but then I have to worry about shipping and I have never shipped large items like this. I have been trying to start a side hustle to make cash and pay off some debts, and I feel like this large bunch of stuff just fell into my lap. If I can sell any of it, it's all profit, but I am just worried I'll be sitting on all this stuff and unable to sell anything. 

So here are my main questions:
1. Would it be worthwhile to sell these individually online or how else can I sell them? Many of these are heavy and I'm not sure how I can ship them safely. Since they are used, I don't know if there really be a market for them.
2. Can I sell these without much knowledge of the products? I don't really want to spend all my free time playing email tag with buyers since I don't know a lot about these and their specs. Some have boxes with model numbers but about half dont, and I am not sure how to look them up.
3. Should I keep the working ones I can test and toss the excess? Some of the lights have strange connections that I'm assuming an electrician would use, but I don't know how to wire these up. Since I have no way to make sure they work, and I don't want to sell broken stuff and deal with returns all the time, should I toss them?


TLDR:
I have closed lighting showroom full of floor model lighting fixtures of every kind and a bunch of bulbs that I want to sell as quickly and easily as possible, would Ebay be my best bet or how else can I make a profit off them? Keep in mind I have little to no info/technical knowledge about most of them.

Ebay,Seller shipped empty box,"I am located in Vienna and bought a Laptop from a seller in the UK, paid via Paypal.

Seller  provided tracking information for - what turned out to be an envelope  with a what seems to be fake ""shipping receipt"" from a company located  in singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

As  the seller stopped responding once I received the ""fake shipment"", I  opened a ""I didn´t receive an item""-dispute with ebay. They got back to  me and asked me to provide either

a) proof of non delivery by the shipping company

b) file a police report

a)  is not possible as I received the shipment that was send with the  provided tracking number. I provided them with pictures of the envelope  that had the tracking number and weight (couple of grams - way too low  for a laptop) printed on it. They did not accept it due to ""their  policy"".

&amp;#x200B;

So  the only option seems to be to go to the police station, ask to file a  report against a person in the UK and send that report to ebay. I am not  even sure that this kind of report will be possible.

What other options do I have?

Ebay,Does anyone use full sentences anymore?,"We have a listing up for $40 with no offers. We usually have best offers enabled, but by that price point it isn't worth the hassle anymore.

So this morning, we got a question on said listing that just said ""30 dollars?"" I'm honestly surprised he even spelled out ""dollars"" but jeeze, can anyone be bothered to type a full sentence anymore? Imagine walking up to a cashier and asking for a 25% discount like a caveman by just grunting ""30 dollars?"" and pushing the item in her face. She'd probably just say ""No, this is 40 dollars, sir.""

Part of me just wants to ignore the message.

Part of me wants to reply with a simple ""40 dollars?""

Part of me wants to be an ass and say ""Yeah, $30 plus $10 to ship"" which is legitimately what it would cost.

And another part of me wants to go off on this guy about the fall of civilized society since people can't be bothered to complete a full thought, and send him a breakdown of how ""free"" shipping and fees work on ebay, all before pointing him to the ""make an offer"" button that... oh it isn't there? Maybe that's because I'm not taking offers!

But knowing me, I'll probably just wait it out a bit to get over my eye rolling, and send him something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, we're not accepting offers on this listing. You can use the watch button to be notified if/when the price is reduced.""

Ebay,Very Weird Situation with Ebay sale,"Listen to this one... 

So i have an ebay store i sell table tennis (ping pong) equipment. I live in New York my store is called Play Table Tennis. I was visiting my parents in Maryland last week so i brought a bunch of the inventory with me. I sold a sheet of table tennis rubber to a man in Reno Nevada. I packed it up in a blue poly bubble mailer and mailed it to him from the post office in Berlin Maryland. I checked the tracking it went straight there and says delivered. 

Here is where it gets strange. First off ill say that the guy seems to not even care about getting a refund or anything so this cant be a scam. We are just confused.

On the same day, he received a white poly bubble mailer (ive only ever had blue) shipped to him from San Diego (ive never been there and dont know anyone that lives there) with ALMOST the same product. There are thousands of different rubbers you can choose when making a table tennis racket, all different brands and types of rubber. I sold and mailed him a rubber from the exact same brand but clearly not the same one. The guy is telling me i am the only purchase he has ever made in his life from ebay so there is no way he bought another rubber from someone else in San Diego. 

&amp;#x200B;

What could possibly have happened lol, this is so bizarre. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking someone else bought him a sheet of rubber as a present and coincidentally someone stole the one i shipped him from his mailbox? Thats so weird though.",8,14,2019-07-09,EBAY,0.046802543103694916,0.9233629107475281,0.029834600165486336

Also, the last email they said: "" Especially because I don’t buy cards at retail value and only buy good deals so I-definitely would not have bought this."" which just makes me think they want to resell and this price isn't allowing them to do that.

Ebay,Delivered in the same zipcode but wrong address? What would you do?,"Purchased a $400 item a week ago. Item was shipped thru UPS and was delivered in my zipcode today. Called UPS to confirm the shipping label and was told it was indeed not my address, but another address (a business) within my zipcode.

Called up eBay and had a 3 way conference call w/ UPS to confirm that the address was incorrect, even though it's in the same zipcode.

eBay advised me to open a INR case and appeal it later since it'll be automatically closed against me as it shown as 'delivered' in eBay's system.

However doing some research, I heard that that's not always the best case. Some people have said on [here](https://community.ebay.com/t5/Archive-Bidding-Buying/SCAM-Seller-ships-item-to-a-different-address-or-person-but-your/td-p/26658783) that it's better to open a SNAD case, therefore the seller is forced to accept a refund, and legitly send them an empty envelope since that's 'technically' what I received. 

What do you guys think? I am out $400 as of now :/

I am planning to go to the business tomorrow and find out what they received. But that shouldn't really help, and apparently the recipient's name isn't my name either, according to the UPS rep.

Ebay,E-bay is really getting bad.,"So I sent out a vintage 400.00 stereo, it was packed to survive and insured. Customer claims it is not what I described, says it is broken. He wants to communicate with me by phone, which I won't do, I ask him for pictures of packaging and item for insurance. He only communicates with all caps/slang, and won't respond to anything I say, claims I did something, deceived him somehow. He sends back stereo outside e-bay system. I get the stereo and the case is broken, but NOTHING works anymore, speaker blown. So E-bay automatically accepts return. I talk to the e-bay for business people..absolutely no help there. They tell me they can't do anything till case is decided. So they decide in customers favor. I start a claim with USPS, when I bring the radio up there they say it was packed good and see no damage to the box but are upset because seller sent the item back to me. So USPS doesn't want to honor their insurance because customer is done f\*cked up. SO I appeal the decision with e-bay, and of course they just went with their original decision saying that they can't prove against the customer.

 So am I just screwed out of 400.00? E-bay used to be a lot better with backing the seller. Now it's just ""F\*ck you, screw you later'? I won't ever suggest anyone use E-bay again if this is what they are going to start doing.

They insinuated I may have written the wrong address on the package as in this person's area there are two addresses that are the same, just different in that the seller is at East and the other address is at West. However, I KNOW this isn't the case. I have OCD and am not an inexperienced shipper/seller. I checked that the address I wrote down matched the one provided by the buyer at least 10 fucking times before I shipped it out. I am stupidly meticulous about things like this. 

Now he keeps feeding me bullshit about apparently USPS says it was delivered, the carrier claims he might have delivered it to the other address, he wants me to call usps and confirm what he's saying, what am I gonna do, blah blah blah blah. 

I have 0 interest in giving a refund or any kind of compensation to this dude and am ready to terminate contact and let Ebay close the request. As per the TOS, given that I input the tracking number in ebay immediately, and that the tracking not only shows delivered but that the zip codes and city match what the buyer provided, I should be in the right here? Is that correct?",12,8,2019-07-12,EBAY,0.08397576957941055,0.889312207698822,0.026712093502283096

Ebay,Need some help about a possible lost item,"Hi,

I sold an item 4 weeks ago that needed to go to NSW, Australia (I'm from Victoria, Australia) and it was lost in transit for about a two and a half weeks. The buyer lodged an unreceived item case and I managed to get the parcel sent back to them (It was stuck at a sorting facility in VIC, AUS). After weeks of hassle, Australia Post resent the item under a new tracking number and on Tuesday (10/07/2019) it showed up as delivered. Today, I receive a message claiming the parcel never reached the Buyer. They seem very convincing they never received the parcel but I'm not sure what to do. I've contacted Australia Post and they've opened up an investigation for this buyer, to locate the lost package, but I'm unsure whether I need to give a refund or what?. I've sold for 2 years and never had this happen before, so this is all new. I have a tracking number provided, but unfortunately not the receipt that confirms it.

Ebay,"If I sell an item, the buyer sells it on, and their customer breaks it is it covered by the money back guarantee?","Last month I sold a high-end watch strap on eBay UK to someone claiming to be a jewellers. Today (16 day after they received it) I get a message saying when they received it, they inspected it and all was good.

Then 2 days ago they attached it to a customer’s watch. The customer inspected it and all was good. Then today (message actually says ""today the 12th"" even though today is the 13th) they received an email from the customer saying the strap has split, they have asked the customer to talk to the manufacture and they want me to comment to which I have sent a vague reply not accepting responsibly.

I know the money back guarantee (MBG) does not cover items forwarded to other address which this kind of is. Will I be forced to refund under the MBG?

Ebay,"Currency conversion question, Paypal ignored my selection","I just bought a vintage turntable from a Canadian seller, so the listing was in CAD. I had done some research and made sure to pay via credit card (since this was an option), and select the option to let my bank handle the currency conversion rather than PayPal to avoid their higher rate. I used a Visa with no foreign exchange fees. It seemed to work fine, as right after the purchase my cards pending transactions reflected a cheaper USD total than what was shown for Paypal. This morning I check again, and my card is now showing the ""*PAYPAL*"" prefix and the amount is higher. Why did this change? I didn't log into PayPal, and chose to have the CC company handle conversion. It seems they've ignored this and now I'm getting slammed with the PayPal conversion charges anyway.

Usually I would just refund an unhappy customer without requiring a return (the items are less than $10 each) but the threats make me not want to. Additionally I can see that they leave a lot of negatives and I don't want to encourage their behaviour as I think they are taking advantage of the system.

Should I respond to the buyer? I'm not sure if I have to because they have already committed feedback extortion that in my opinion is clear enough I will be able to get any feedback removed. I don't really want to talk to them more because their messages were a bit nasty and I don't want to open myself up to more unpleasantness (I'm sensitive).

They can still open INAD and make me pay for return postage, right?

Ebay,Out $600... what do I do?,"Hi everyone. This will be a long one but I really need your thoughts. A month ago, I ordered an expensive item on eBay, but never received it. I noticed that the seller changed the tracking number to another one that says delivered to my zip code. I contacted them asking what was up and they told me they were contacted by someone else saying that they're me and asking to send to a different address because ""I"" made a mistake. The seller obliged no questions asked. What's important is that other address is in the same zip code as I am.

I told the seller that it's a scam, to which they told me I should go to the police. I opened a case on eBay but it was closed because tracking shows delivered to my zip. I appealed the case and called them and they told me they would do a refund if I go to the police. I filed a police report and sent the info to eBay. Then, I made a mistake and called PayPal to ask if they can help me if eBay doesn't. The rep told me to open a claim with them since they will do a better job at investigating the issue, so I opened a claim with PayPal. What I didn't know is when a claim is filed with PayPal it automatically closes any cases I have open on eBay. The next day, I receive two messages from eBay 20 minutes apart - one saying that they approve the refund; and the other saying that my case is now closed since I opened one on PayPal. In the morning, I receive a notice from PayPal saying the case was closed since tracking shows delivered...

I tried calling eBay - they say that once the case is transferred to PayPal there is nothing they can do. I tried calling PayPal - they advised me to appeal the case, which I did, and they just closed it with same resolution: it's delivered, we don't care. The seller has their money so they don't care. Short of issuing a chargeback, what can I do? Are there some obscure ways to contact someone on eBay/PayPal to have this resolved? Regular reps just shrug at me at this point. Is there a way to prove that the package was delivered to a different address other than have PayPal talk to the police officer working on my case?

Edit: thanks for all the input. I'll try calling for some time and then do the chargeback if everything else fails.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: I called my PO and asked them to send a confirmation of the fact the package was sent to another address. They've sent it to me via fax. Hopefully this will suffice.

A gazillion calls with different reps and endless hours of being on hold/forwarded/describing the same thing all over again later, two unlikely discoveries that I made: 1) Too many PayPal reps can be woefully dismissive and incompetent, 2) Delaware State Police was the most helpful organization I've encountered whilst calling.

Ebay,Buyer Requested Chargeback,"A buyer many months ago bought a set of Jabra Elite 65t earbuds. I very clearly listed the item as only having 1 earbud, shown in pictures and multiple times mentioned in the description. 

About 2 months later, she requested a refund, as it only had 1 earbud and it was INAD. I declined it, telling her I clearly stated it was only 1 earbud in both the description and photos, in which she rudely responded and said she was going to escalate it. 

Not worrying about it, a month later I see that $90 was taken from my PayPal account ($70 item + $20 PayPal fee). I see that she went through her credit card company and requested a chargeback. I called both eBay and PayPal, eBay was not of much help initially and PayPal said to provide evidence that the item was not INAD. Since it was well past 90 days at this point, I couldn’t get the original listing. A few days ago I contacted eBay and a nice representative was able to get me the description with the item number.

Ebay,"Buyer has paid but shipment got returned and not responding, what do I do?","A very weird situation here.

I sold a camera to someone with a 5 star rating and around 50 reviews. All reviews checked out and are legit. He paid instantly upon winning the bid. 

He paid around £800 for it, I expected him to contact me to confirm things since it was a big purchase, he did not. Strange but I still packed it and shipped it to his address.

2 weeks go by and I get a slip from the post office telling me that I have a package to collect. Weird since I never ordered anything. I go to collect it and huzzah, it’s my camera! Still in the packaging I did and all safe. 

I contacted Royal Mail to ask why the package was sent back to me, they said that the delivery man went to the door, and the person that answered it said that they were not the person that it said on the packaging and that they did not order anything!!!

I was so puzzled. Royal Mail advised me to contact the buyer to ask if he possibly ha changed address and forgot to update his eBay information.

Ebay,Seller Beware: Buyer tilted market,"I wanted to give you all a bit of background on myself and Ebay store. I sell a wide assortments of collectible trading cards, vintage clothing and other hobby &amp; home goods.  I

I got some negative feed back today from a buyer concerning a order for a Randomly Assorted Card Lot. He claimed that the lot didn't contain the rare cards that he was looking and asked when more cards were being shipped. 

The thing is he placed two orders on Ebay's platform.  And left negative feed back on both orders, that means that one order is weighted double and impacting my score. 

So I call ""Seller Support""

Being an Amazon buyer and Seller also, I can see why Ebay is falling off slowly in my opinion. Amazon shows a uniform customer and seller service and attention. Making every effort to resolve problems the first time a consumer or seller calls in. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Ebay's side of customer service, nothing could be more different. I was on the phone today for 1 hour speaking to first a general CSR agent and then sent to a ""Supervisor"" then ""Manager"" all of which requested that they give me a call back once the person that could address my issue was available. Claiming that they could not transfer the call from the CSR's desk to the management queue and walked over from their desk, they claimed that they needed to hang up and call me back. (Total BS)

""We will deal with you on our terms and our convenience"" is all this says to me. You will continue to be pushed aside. 

The customer was contacted already by this point and I made a point that in the description of the item that it is not guaranteeing any kind of card or rarity, however because of the title where it lists the type of rarities in the random lot, all the representatives said that same thing, it could be misconstrued as getting rare cards even tho in the listing it specifies that no specific card or rarity would be sent. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ""Manager"" ended up hanging up on me. Something I have never seen. Constantly interrupting, chuckling at me when I asked for escalation claiming that the Supervisor would say the same thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know this post is just another echo into the long and deep cave of the internet, but for real for real, fuck Ebay.   
If you are a new seller that is just starting your inventory go to Amazon and do FBA or ship the item out yourself once sold. They make it easier to manage your inventory and have better support when issue arises. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up calling again after they hung on me and I got the feed back removed after 10 minutes with a different rep. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that do you get from this? Don't waste your time escalating to a manager, just hang up and call again.

Ebay,Buyer opened INR case for a GSP item. The courier in his country lost the package so he's requesting a refund. Am I at risk of being liable for the refund cost?,"I sold an item to an international customer about 6 weeks ago.

Fast forward to today and I received an INR case from the buyer, who explained that the local courier in his country lost the package and he either wants the item or a refund. 

If the courier genuinely cannot find the package and the buyer then requests a refund, will I be charged for the refund? It seems wildly unfair to be charged for that in this circumstance, considering I utilized the GSP and fulfilled my duty as a seller to the T. 

Also, if the buyer is refunded out of eBay's pockets, will I be refunded the final value fee, or does eBay keep that regardless? I imagine it's the latter because I will have gotten my money and have completed the sale, but I figured I'd ask anyway.

Ever since the spring seller update, sales have taken a nosedive. What used to be a good day is now a good week. I've had to let all my staff go, as there's neither enough business nor enough money to keep them around I looked at my records and I've had more days with no sales in June and July than I had in the entire year of 2018. Inventory is still stocked with items that are in demand and priced competitively.

The eBay seller forums are ablaze with people making the same complaints. My theory is that it's changes that were made to the search algorithm when the GTC change went into effect.

These cars are called custom or clone cars, any sought after one will have customs/clones made. For example I liked one model, and I had a real one that I sold for $950, but since I liked the model I picked up a custom/clone for a fraction of the price of the real one.

Now I didn't claim it as any specific thing in the title or description. All I knew for sure was that it wasn't the real model, as I only had it listed at $100 instead of $600 that it usually goes for.

This guy bids 1hr before the auction ends, then sends me a message asking what I know about it, and I explain that it could be a custom/clone, or perhaps even a prototype since when I got it months ago there was another prototype with it in the bunch.

He sends me a message back saying something along the lines of ""I know it's a fucking clone, by X, Y, and Z reasons, you're a liar and should list the item as that"", when I clearly stated in the description that it had to be a clone, custom, or prototype. Well, that along with the price being 1/6th of the real version.

The auction ends and immediately I get a request to cancel the sale.

I know usually the obvious answer is to just cancel the sale and get it over with, but that's pretty shitty to insult someone and then cancel the sale. It was obvious when he insulted me I wasn't going to get paid for it, but I'd honestly rather this guy take an unpaid item ding against his account.

It's been a day and a half and I still haven't responded to his item request yet.

Ebay,"Ebay, false return and bad advice has cost me total £300, no recourse ?","Hi,   


I was hoping somebody would have any advice for me, if there is anything more I can do.   


I sold a high value phone on eBay, the seller first claimed it didn't work, then after several emails, that they admitted they didn't know how to use it and ultimately wanted a return because it was faulty.   


I was told by eBay I have to accept the return, I accept the return. phone comes back, works fine. As far as I am concerned it is a false return. The headphones were returned broken, and the case missing. I contacted eBay about how I appeal the return, and was told twice to issue a refund first, and close the case. Then I can appeal the case, and eBay would consider it out of their own pocket.   


So I did that, I then call eBay back, and the advisor said ""I can see you have issued a refund, that is not a problem..."", they sent me a link to provide documentation about my loss, I provided them all the evidence including receipts and shop receipt proving the phone was in working order.   


I got a response stating, that because I issued the refund, there is nothing more that can be done. I call eBay and the advisor tells me that whoever I spoke previously (3 different advisors in total) must have all provided me with false information and that there is no evidence in their notes that they instructed me to issue the refund. Well I was on the phone whilst issuing the refund, they told me what to press to do it as I could not see the option, they were on the phone to me explaining exactly what to press. They claimed there was no evidence of any such advice. I asked why the last individual I spoke to would send me a link for documentation acknowledging the damaged items when it was already evident that I had issued the refund as per the previous advisors instructions. 

&amp;#x200B;

He said the best that they could do was escalate it so the persons who provided me with false information basically gets ""told off"" and theres nothing more I can do but go to small claims court??! how is this fair, I did everything I was instructed and I'm now out of pocket. I wish I would have recorded those conversations, does eBay not record them. Can I make an official complaint about this? they said there is no evidence on their end I was instructed to issue the refund. Which I find hard to believe. Initially they claimed they could not find the email which mentioned the damaged items until I provided them with the ID number.  How would so many people give me wrong advice. Is there anything more I can do ? :(!",11,4,2019-07-20,EBAY,0.2530965209007263,0.7235264182090759,0.02337707206606865

Ebay,Did PayPal and eBay split to charge more fees?,"I recently sold a laptop for $1700, got charged $55 bucks from PayPal and $185 on eBay. All up, it costed me $240 just to sell my item. I have sold a couple of expensive things over the years, mostly before the split and I don’t remember paying such high fees.

That’s not even the worst part. PayPay held my money for weeks. I made contact with eBay and they practically said you never would’ve received your money if you hadn’t contacted customer support. This is despite a decade-long, 100% positive feedback history, with many high-value transactions to my account (the buyer even left positive feedback the day she got it, yet that didn’t seem to matter).

It just seems like eBay and PayPal have become money gouging cesspits after their split. I would honestly hate to be an actual seller right now, because the above fiasco seems like it’s not just attracting fraudulent buyers, it’s creating fraudulent buyers.

Ebay,returning an item after seller has already refunded,"sorry if this has been answered before, but i couldn't find it.

i won an item, was happy, it arrived broken/unusable. happens, i contact the seller to see what they'd like to do (prefer to do this rather than open a case) and they immediately refund my purchase. which was unexpected, since honestly it would just cost a few bucks to repair. 

they then ask me to ship it back to them, but i can't open up a return because they've already refunded me. i tell them this and ask for them to send me a prepaid shipping label and they say they don't know how to do this, and that they'd pay for the shipping and suggested i try to stuff it into one of those flat rate envelopes. it doesn't fit (envelope keeps tearing) so i let them know and tell them i'm glad to pack it in a box but it will cost more.

they never respond to that but a few days later have started asking me if i've shipped it yet. since i don't feel comfortable paying to ship this broken thing back to them out of my own pocket, (and based on my interactions don't have full faith that they'd actually refund me the shipping cost) i haven't returned it yet. 

do i keep the item? that feels crummy, but i don't think i should have to ship it back out of my own pocket when they sent me a broken item marked used/very good condition.

Ebay,The feeling of winning against a scummy buyer just to learn they won an appeal,"I've sold on eBay for 20 of the past 21 years and work hard at it. Once or twice a year, I encounter scummy buyers and sometimes have to live with knowing they ""won"" even when I did, too.

Buyer bought and paid for the item. We instantly processed and shipped it. Buyer asked for a cancellation without explanation but it was too late and we declined it. 

They got really really nasty in messages with us. It was explained to them and they got quiet until they got the item. They went went back to nasty, telling us they didn't want the item and we must be desperate for money to ship it to them anyway. 

We have a No Returns Accepted on our stuff for people exactly like this one. They requested a return for ""changed mind"" which eBay told us was optional. I looked at their feedback and saw other sellers posting that this buyer had tried return scams before, with one saying that they ""send back a box of garbage"" (and of course, these feedbacks are positive since they can't leave a negative for a buyer).

So we decline their request. Then they get even nastier, saying they are sending it back anyway. They left a negative full of insults.

So I called eBay to report the buyer and get the feedback removed. The rep was quick to grant both requests. The eBay rep also suggested refusing the package should one arrive. 

The buyer opened up a case with PayPal next. They posted the tracking for the ""returned anyway"" package in the case, this time claiming it was defective. I called PayPal, which also suggested refusing the package, stating that they buyer will lose this case because they sent it back without being told they could. PayPal closed the case, deciding in my favor right there on the spot. 

Days later, the package arrived. I looked at the listed weight out of curiosity and noted it was several ounces less than the weight of what we shipped out.  I believe they sent us back a box of garbage as another seller said they did to them. I refused it on the spot and handed it right back to the USPS driver. 

Buyer contacts me a couple of days later to brag, saying they got their money back anyway. They appealed PayPal's decision and won somehow. 

Now, this doesn't impact us of course. An appeal win like that is paid by PayPal. It doesn't impact our ratings and the money didn't come from us. And as I noted before, eBay removed their feedback and all that. So basically, this scummy buyer didn't do any damage to us with their antics.

But I am still annoyed that they won in the end. They might not have succeeded in hurting our store but they got their money back AND the item. It irks me, especially when I look back and see that this isn't the first time they've pulled this on a seller and since they won, it probably won't be the last.",16,63,2019-07-22,EBAY,0.12872005999088287,0.8373398780822754,0.03394005820155144

Ebay,I find this decision by eBay appalling... do you think I have a chance with an appeal? [seller],"Hey redditors.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a recent decision by eBay made against me and which I think is absolutely ridiculous, I'm fuming.  I'd like to know if you think I've got a chance here with an appeal... here are the facts.

* I sold a pair of golf shoes 2 months ago, they were brand new, in the box, unopened, never worn.  They were a very limited edition shoe that sold out pretty quickly hence I was selling them with a c.50% markup.
* I am not a business and cannot deal with returns, therefore I stipulate this on everything that I sell: sold as seen, no returns.
* About two weeks after receiving the item, the buyer emailed me saying that he has worn the shoes and they have creased on the toe - you know, in the exact place EVERY pair of shoes in the world creases when you stand on your toes, and he is not happy with this and wants to take action.
* I  respond and explain that this it is unfortunate that he is unhappy but unless the manufacturer will replace them (and I offer to speak to them on his behalf) then there isn't much I can do about it, and remind him that they were in perfect condition when I sent them to him. Also, this is the second pair I have sold, the first buyer has not said a word - my opinion is that the buyer in this case is being very fussy.
* He then raises a ticket with eBay stating that they were 'Not as described' - which is a lie, this creasing happened after he wore them (and is actually pretty standard, I have two other pairs of the same shoe that have creased in exactly the same place)
* eBay have sided with him and asked him to send them back for a full refund.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't received the item back yet, but I'm due to be down the cost of the shoes down (£120 - as they are now worn I cannot sell again as new), plus the markup (£50), which I'm assuming is just down to the fact the buyer has lied about a fault to eBay.

&amp;#x200B;

Ebay,Am I being unreasonable asking for a partial refund here?,"I purchased an autographed 8""x10"" photo via Buy-it-Now, from a reputable seller (has a COA, seller is a UACC member, I checked references, etc.), for their full asking price (\~ $75 after shipping). Not a great price, but I like the photo content and the celebrity is deceased, so I pulled the trigger. Seller is a long time ebay seller, I am a long-time buyer, and we're both 100% positive feedback - it's neither of our first rodeo.

I pay instantly. Seller ships on time, package arrives quickly, but the moment I see it I am concerned. The seller shipped in a plain paper 8.5""x11"" envelope, with no bubble wrap. It has ""Do Not Bend"" written on it, but USPS apparently took that as a challenge and has been ROUGH on this item. I'm hoping the photo is between cardboard and in a rigid top loader, but I open to find no cardboard, no top loader, just a poly sleeve, the COA, and one piece of 3/16"" foam core board. The foam core is bent/dinged in several places and the photo is damaged - mostly on the edges and corners. My plan had been to mount the image in a floating frame, but with the edge and corner damage that isn't possible without it looking like crap, so my only option is to mat and frame the item, which adds a ton of cost.

What is incredibly frustrating is that this damage was completely preventable if the seller had taken more care in packing the item. If the photo shows up undamaged I would be 100% happy and it would be on my wall already. Instead I'm left with either the the hassle of sending it back, or a project piece.

~~Is it unreasonable to ask for a partial refund to cover the cost of matting the photo? (\~ $15)~~

EDIT: I asked for, but then rescinded my request for a partial refund, and said if I decide to return the item I'll just follow the normal INAD process. The seller (to their credit) offered a full refund, but seemed to bristle at the notion that they did anything wrong. I have just come to the place where it isn't worth my time or aggravation. My sincere thanks to everyone for their comments/suggestions. It helped me gain a sense of perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT2: Strangely, after I rescinded my request for a partial refund the seller offered me a partial refund for ***more*** than I had initially asked for.  Not sure why, but I think we're both just happy to put the matter to bed. I appreciate the opinions shared here, and I will not request a partial refund in the future. If one is offered - great, but otherwise accept it as it arrived, or return it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: Seller packaged item poorly. USPS damaged item. I asked for partial refund, seller bristled, I got advice from reddit and rescinded partial refund request to not look scammy. Seller then offered a partial refund for more than I requested.",18,10,2019-07-23,EBAY,0.0525011345744133,0.9105867147445679,0.03691217675805092
Ebay,trouble getting refund,"I need some feedback or info on a refund I'm not getting from ebay. 

I bought and returned this item a month ago that cost a lot of money. The seller accidentally refunded me without accepting the return request and subsequently cancelled the refund somehow. The seller sent me a shipping label instead and I shipped back the item being told by ebay CS that the seller would have to refund me again upon receipt of the returned package. The seller offers to refund through Zelle (which I wasn't sure was legit) so I escalated through the resolution center. The resolution was ruled in my favor but nearly three weeks later, I'm being told that the refund has failed to process multiple times even though I was promised that I would get back my money throughout several deadlines. I'm being left in the dark with no guarantees that I'll ever get my money back. Has anyone dealt with this kind of absurdity?

Ebay,Question on if I have the Right to Complain About a Collection that I Bought,"Hi, before I begin this post, I would like to say that I am a frequent seller, so I know what it is like to deal with annoying buyers who complain that the item was not ""as advertised."" With that though, I believe that sellers should always list **everything** about their item (for example, the brand).

&amp;#x200B;

I bought a collection of toys called Beyblades. These toys are real only if they are made by Takara Tomy (Japanese), SonoKong (Korean), or Hasbro (American). I bought a collection of New In Box toys, thinking that they were made by Takara or SonoKong.

&amp;#x200B;

When I received the box, I found that the toys were actually made by a Chinese, knockoff brand. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is if I have the right to complain to eBay about the collection not being advertised properly. The seller did take good photos of the collection, but it was difficult to tell by looking at the boxes. Also, the seller did not mention the brand of the Beyblades at all- not in the title, description, or the place in the description that asks for the brand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not trying to be racist by saying that Chinese, Japanese, and Korean writing looks the same; what I mean is that the pictures and fonts on the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean toy Beyblade boxes are very similar (at least in my opinion). I guess I should have asked, but I believe that the seller should have been more clear about the brand. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ebay,"Purchased charged as cash advance, causing $10.50 credit charge","Has anyone ever heard of this? A seller charged a purchase as a cash advance on my credit card, causing the credit card to charge me $10.50 in cash advance fees. The credit card company said it's the seller's fault. The seller says it's eBay's fault. eBay says it's PayPal's fault. This shit is ridiculous. If I can't ever know for sure how much I'm going to pay for an item on eBay, I'm not buying anymore on eBay.

How common is this nonsense?

UPDATE: The card is a Costco Visa supplied by Citibank. I've spoken to everyone at this point and everyone just blames the next person in the ring. However, Citibank did refund the money after 3 conversations and me getting really pissed. They are also able to permanently shut off the cash advance feature, which I had them do. If this happens to you on a Costco Visa or with a Citibank card, at eBay or via PayPal, speak up. It'd be an easy way for them to make a few extra bucks because so few people actually check their credit card statements.

If it doesn't sell after the three postings, I often chuck it into a box, factor it out of my system through accounting, and drop it at the local Goodwill. I feel like I might be giving up too quickly, but after three postings, I'm disgusted with it if it doesn't sell.

Ebay,Ebay gave the buyer a refund while the item was in transit. Now the buyer has the item and didn't have to pay for it. What should I (the seller) do?,"So basically what happened is my buyer lives in Saipan, (an island near Taiwan) and I live in the continental US. After winning the auction he chose USPS ground shipping. Even though he lives across the pacific ocean from me, USPS still technically ships to him since Saipan is a US territory. Choosing ground shipping meant it was going to be put on a boat to go across the pacific ocean. During the time on the boat USPS didn't put any updates on the tracking information (there wasn't really any updates to give, it was just on a boat the whole time). Well apparently it's ebay's policy to issue a refund if the tracking information hasn't been updated in 7 days. I contacted USPS multiple times to see if there is any way they could update the tracking information, and they told me there was nothing they could do since the item was currently on a boat. The next update that would happen would be when it hits land and is scanned again.

So ebay issued a full refund to the buyer. At this point I couldn't stop the item or have it sent back, because again it was just on a boat in the middle of the ocean. I've contacted ebay multiple times too but they don't seem to care or really even understand the issue. 

The tracking information has now been updated of course, it was delivered to the guy's house, but it's too late. Ebay has already given him a refund, and now he has the item too. I tried contacting the buyer but haven't heard back from him (of course). 

I have no idea what to do at this point. The buyer has the item (which cost over $100 btw) and he never paid for it. Ebay won't do anything about it. USPS can't do anything about it.

Once an eBay seller alias is big enough, the entire business model seems to switch to non-delivery and hoping that people forget to complain 8 or 9 weeks later. It has always been bad, but now it's really bad. I'm not receiving two orders for every order that I do get.

Ebay,Lost Item Due to Change of Address After Posting,"Hi Everyone,

I’m not a big user of eBay but occasionally I sell old computer stuff.

Last week I sold an old MacBook. On Sunday I got the message that the item sold and I clicked on the app notification and printed off the buyers address on a piece of paper.

The next morning I posted the item from the local post office with this address on the box.

The day after I had a quick look at the app to see the info but I noticed the address was different. It was now a store pick up address.

I messaged him saying the address looks different and that the parcel will be going to the other address I first saw. However he replied saying he hasn’t lived there for a year.

I called the courier to see if they could redirect the parcel and deliver to the new address.

Unfortunately it arrived at the original address and was signed for by someone.

I called parcel force again and they said they could try pick up and redeliver.

They couldn’t pick the parcel up they said, haven’t got more details yet.

The buyer says it’s between me and eBay but I spoke to eBay and they said I should be fine and are ok to release funds on their end. They said the address is his supplier address.

The buyer has raised a claim with PayPal saying the item isn’t there. I will call PayPal this morning and explain.

I’m not sure if this is an eBay glitch or he is a scammer. He has a lot of positive feedback. Can I accidentally send it to his wrong address?

Any advice? I feel like I’m going to lose out the money and MacBook. It’s stressing me out.

Ebay,How does eBay's global coupons affect sellers?,"eBay is offering ""$5 off a $10+ purchase"" with a certain code right now.

The other day I found an item that was only $10.09 which I was considering buying since the actual price would only be $5.09 after the coupon. I waited a day or so to think about it (because I wasn't sure I even wanted to buy it at all) and decided I might as well get it with the coupon.

But when I logged back in, the seller had dropped the price under the $10 threshhold, to $9.98, effectively RAISING the price for **me**, as I'd have to pay $9.98 for the item now instead of the $5.09 with the coupon.

I'm just wondering WHY a seller would do this? Do these global coupons hurt the seller? If not, is this particular seller just oblivious to the coupon at the moment?

Just trying to figure out if I should message them and ask them to raise the price back to $10 so that I can buy the item with the coupon, or if they did it on purpose because the coupon negatively affects them.

Ebay,Is it normal to get lots of views but no purchases?,"Hey all. My buy it now items are getting like 15-20 views each but no watchers or anything. I've listed 24 buy it now items since Monday and only 5 have sold so far.

I'm making sure my prices are competitive and I'm putting clear pictures of the front &amp; back (I'm selling Pokemon cards). Is it normal to get this much traffic with no purchases?

I used to sell on there a lot in like 2012-2013 and I remember making a lot more sales. In the item description I'm just putting the bare minimum information (basically just a sentence stating the condition of the item) bc I'm posting on mobile, could that be the reason? I didn't think that would matter much since the pictures show the item clearly, but maybe I should spice it up? 

Or, is the eBay market for this type of thing just not as hot as it used to be? I know there are a lot of new selling platforms that have come out in the past few years.

Thanks in advance fellow eBayers!

Edited to add: could this maybe be because I haven't sold anything in years, and maybe that's stopping my posts from being as prevalent in searches? Idk just a theory lol",17,29,2019-07-27,EBAY,0.0191855039447546,0.9220912456512451,0.05872323736548424

Ebay,Wondering if A. I've just been getting lucky with Ebay support lately? Or B. Ebay has been changing it's tune and actually respecting its sellers.,"Issue: I recently sold a large item to a buyer in California(zone 8 for me), and had set up a rate table to add a $15 surcharge in the case of a long distance purchase. I accepted an offer, the item was paid for, but without the surcharge I had set up.

Resolution: I called Ebay and after a few minutes of talking and a hold for the operator to speak with their ""engineers"" they covered the $15.00 themselves as a direct credit to my account. The operator also mentioned opening a ticket to look into the issue to prevent future problems. 

Thoughts: If I had never called I would never have got that $15, I'm honestly a little surprised that they did pay it. I wonder if they just count on some people not making the effort? Also full disclosure I'm fairly active and a Top Rated seller, I'm sure that helps but I would hope that they'd treat sellers the same.

I currently have 42 active listings and 4 sold. I just went to list my 43rd item and it said there is a $0.35 insertion fee. So either I’m really bad at math or something is wrong.

Ebay,Buyer return posted weighing ~9KG less?,"A few weeks ago, I sold a £300 3D Printer on eBay. The buyer messaged me asking to collect it, and came to collect it the next day. Several days later, the buyer opened a return saying ""there were marks on the print bed"". The buyer agreed via eBay message that if I issue a £40 partial refund and send him a brand new print bed he would close the return.

As soon as he received the brand new print bed, I received an email saying the return has been posted. I contacted eBay and they confirmed that he had used the 2KG Return Label they provided. My concern is that the printer weighs over 11KG, which leads me to believe he has sent an empty box. The return is scheduled to be delivered tomorrow (30th July) however, as I explained to him, I am away on holiday until 4th August.

Having spoken to eBay they require me to inspect the package to move forward, however I will not be able to until 4 days after it has been delivered. I am confident it will not be the printer given the fact the parcel weighs a full 9KG less!

Is there anything I can do to extend the deadline by which I need to issue a refund? I am worried I will arrive home to an empty box and be £300 out of pocket.

Edit: Just to clear something up, in actual fact (as per the buyers request) I sent the buyer a LokBuild sheet to go on top of the original bed. He still needs the original bed and shouldn't have sent it back.

Regardless of whether it is the print bed or not, eBay have asked that I issue a full £300 refund and I have had no communication from the buyer to tell me what the return actually is.",26,22,2019-07-29,EBAY,0.04043585807085037,0.9233465194702148,0.036217547953128815

Ebay,Passive aggressive positive feedback,"I sold some stuff randomly in the past but I recently started selling again and maybe it’s just me, but buyers seem to be more high maintenance than usual lately. 

I listed a pair of preowned shoes I wore once. They were a half size too small for my feet and the one and only day I wore them I ended up buying a pair of flip flops while I was out because they were hurting my feet too much. Never wore them again so I put them up for sale on eBay. 

I get a message from someone asking tons of questions and wanting more specific photos. I answer all of her questions, tell her exactly what I said above and sent her more photos. I accepted her offer and after fees I made $35 on a $200 pair of shoes, but I’m fine with that since I’m trying to downsize my closet and get rid of stuff. 

My handling time has always been two days but immediately after she pays she starts asking me when I will ship them and follows up with “I really hope you can ship today, please ship very soon”. 

I messaged her back and told her it was 5:00pm on a Sunday and the post office was closed but I would drop them off the next day. She follows it up with “well I hope you can drop them off when they first open so they go out right away”. I didn’t bother to respond at that point and I dropped the shoes off the next day on my lunch break. They got to her two days later. 

Days go by and I forget about it until I see I have new feedback. It was positive but she said something along the lines of “I guess I’ll put positive only cuz I was able to clean the bottoms but they were worn more than I was told”

I was annoyed but I couldn’t help but laugh. I even had photos of the bottoms of the shoes on my listing and I sent her additional zoomed in photos of the bottoms and sides that she specifically requested.

Ebay,"After Selling for Months, I’ve Encountered my First Problem","I’ve been an eBay seller for months now, and I’ve been doing fairly well... until recently. 

I sold a tablet to someone July 25th, and yesterday, July 30th, the person told me that the tablet is no longer working, and that they want a return. 

What do I do? I’m somewhat concerned that if the item is sent back in won’t be in the same condition I shipped it in (which was fully functioning).

EDIT: thank you everyone for your help and advice. I’ve received the tablet back, and oddly enough it’s 100% fine? 

I guess I’ll wait a couple of days and see if it starts to “not work” like she stated. If it continues to work, I guess I have no other choice but to refund her? Not too sure. If it stops working, then what? 

Again, when I shipped it out it was 100% working no problems at all.

Ebay,What is the direct link to the free USPS (ebay branded) boxes?,"They sure don't make it easy to find.

Ebay,Should I block buyers with too many unpaid items?,"Should I block buyers with too many unpaid items?

All my listings are BIN and immediate payment required, so ""unpaid item"" issue doesn't directly affect me. I could make the case that I shouldn't have that 'unpaid item' block in place, and I can see it has blocked six sales in the last 60 days.

OTOH, I wonder if UPI isn't a 'leading indicator' of a buyer who will otherwise be problematic. If you don't pay for what you buy, what other nonsense will you pull?

Wondering what the 'mood of the room' is on that?

Ebay,How regularly are 1£/$ may selling fee promotions?,I've just missed one and waiting to sell some more expensive camera kit so would be useful if theres another one soon!
