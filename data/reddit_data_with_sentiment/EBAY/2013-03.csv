Ebay,Leaving feedback is boring so I try to make it fun,,14,41,2013-03-01,EBAY,0.07615857571363449,0.8921868205070496,0.03165459260344505
Ebay,"**Throwaway**I don't know how well received this will be... But, here's a way that I've found to get past the blurred out / censored bidders names...   NO PERSONAL INFO.    *MOD's if this is against the rules then delete away...*","I just found this trick... if you want to call it that from picking up a somewhat rare ""car part"".  There's only been one ""car part"" in the completed listings and only one current listing for a buy-it-now, with two offers. So, I thought, I wish I knew who they were so I could see if they were interested in mine. (If they were, I'd list it as a buy-it-now for them, to keep the trans. on ebay...) 

Though, I know people used to look at losing bidders on items and offer to sell them the same item through the ebay message system, instead of dealing with an auction. I guess the best way to describe it would be feedback tracking... So here's how to do it....


First, you'll need two browser windows.

1. In window 1, find the item that the censored bidder lost / made offer on.
2. Click on bids / offers made link.
3. Click on the ebayer's feedback number.
4. Find a recent (less then 3 months) feedback.  The more unique the feedback the better.
5. Highlite and copy, the unique  recent feedback.
6.Open the 2nd browser window, to Google, and paste the feedback into the search.
7.DON'T CLOSE THE FIRST WINDOW.
8. Hopefully, the Google search will find the same feedback and click on any of the links with the same feedback in them.
9. This will bring you to some random ebayer's page.  Go to this ebayer's feedback page and search (CTRL-F or manually) for the feedback you Google search for.
10.  You should now have a seller / buyer that would have dealt with the ebayer that you are looking for.
11. Click on ebayer B's feedback number, to bring you to their feedback page.
12. Now, on ebayer B's feedback page, click on ""FEEDBACK LEFT FOR OTHERS"". 
13. If this ebayer is a large seller / buyer, make sure to show the  feedbacks 100 or 200 at a time.
14. Go, back to window 1  and copy the date and time the feedback was left.
15. Then use a CTRL-F, and paste the date and time info into the search box and... voila... You should now have the ebay account that you were looking for.  You can always look and double check the feedback number to make sure you've found the right person.

So, There you go...",3,16,2013-03-01,EBAY,0.04972663149237633,0.9211892485618591,0.029084140434861183

Ebay,The absolute quickest way to not sell an auction. Insult a potential buyer!,"Alright. I'm in the market for a wheel for my Xbox 360. I'm looking for a good one that hasn't been destroyed, so I do a lot of detective work. ""Are all the parts there?"", ""Is it in working condition?"", etc, etc.

Then I run into this winner. Guy is selling a $300+ Fanatec wheel for a Buy it Now of $180, and starting bid of $20. He lists the wheel as being ""opened but not used"" in his description.

He also only lists 4 pictures of the BOX that the wheel comes in and 2 stock images from Fanatec's website. Being a knowledgable ebayer, I decide to ask some questions about the auction to make sure that I'd be getting what he's selling and in working condition.

&gt; do you have any pictures of the wheel out of the box instead of stock pictures?

a few minutes later I get a response

&gt; Actually I do not want to open it becuase if I do then it well be called used not new and plus the stock photos look exactly like the wheel I can take it out of the box if and when u buy the wheel until then and if u don't like the wheel after you buy it and I send photos then you can not buy it.

Alright... Someone's story isn't straight here. He says he doesn't want to open the box, but he clearly shows pictures of an opened box and even admits that he's opened the box. I decide to prod further cause he might've forgotten he mentioned in the auction that the box was opened.

&gt; The photos show the black packing tape on the box has been cut, and by your own admission in the auction description you list it as being opened but not used. I'm not trying to be a jerk or anything. I'm just wary about bidding even more now given the discrepancy in your description and what you've told me.

I get this response back a few minutes later.

&gt; Do you now what sir just stop arguing and if you want the item then bid on and ask questions later if you never wanted the item they why even send messages people like you need to grow up and learn how eBay works the messages are just if your gonna buy the item and want to now something real quick not to keep on asking questions and telling nonsense. If you want it then bid on if you don't then get lost I don't need your bid its that simple what do you not get mr I like to ask auestions a lot.

Wow... Just... wow. When I got it, I was literally dumbfounded that someone could act this way. And I'm not even getting into the grammar of it. The lack of punctuation is frightening. Heck, I typed all of my messages on my cell phone and I was able to throw together a more coherent sentence. Here's my response to this diatribe

&gt; I was prepared to drop the money on your auction had I received the information I was looking for about the actual item you had for sale given that your auction was lacking any sort of definitive information about it. It's called making an informed decision. However, since you've decided that rather than help make the sale by providing a little additional information that could sway someone like myself who is on the fence about making the purchase, you'd rather insult and be little a would be buyer. As this is the case, I will take my money elsewhere. Good day sir.

And of cource I get this back in return. 

&gt;Good day chepo!

I won't bother posting this guys auction up or give his name. If you want just search ""Forza CSR Wheel Xbox 360"" on eBay and it should be listed under Buy It Now of $180.

Ebay,"Bought a Macbook Pro with AppleCare, found out warranty is void - What should I do?","At the beginning of February I bought a 2011 Macbook Pro on eBay, because it was much cheaper, and it came with AppleCare until 2015. Bought the item, its been working great. It was cheaper because the sides of the computer were a little dented, but everything works great.

All of the sudden the computer wasn't waking from sleep properly, I would have to force the computer shut down to get the screen to turn on. I messaged the seller, and he told me to take it to Apple to get it repaired.

I finally got around to that today, and was told because of the dents, the AppleCare is void until I have that replaced. So if I wanted to get the sleep issue fixed, it would cost me $208+tax to get the dents fixed AND the cost of the sleep issue.

Now, I, and a few of my friends and family think I shouldn't have to pay for this, because the seller advertised it as having AppleCare for any issues, however the warranty is void. So I messaged the seller describing what happened, and he told me to send it back and he'd get it fixed. However, when I asked about the dents, he told me he wouldn't get that fixed, so my warranty would still be void.

I asked for a partial refund to cover the costs of the repair, however the seller seemed reluctant to do that. Would this be something I can open up a case with eBay for? The warranty was a major reason for my purchase, and it was heavily advertised in the description, however it's void.

I paid for one of the orders, and the 2nd order remains unpaid. I contacted the seller explaining everything I just wrote above, and told them that I would be willing to pay for the re-listing of the two items.

So I guess my question is, how exactly do I use eBay's automated system to  initiate a refund. Do I press ""return this item?"" Do I have to wait for the seller to cancel the transaction?  Do i log into paypal and try to stop payment?

Ebay,To ship or not to ship.,"So i sold a MacBook Pro the new one with the retina display.  Midway through the auction I noticed the high bidder was a newbie, just signed up that day 0 feedback. 
I shot them an email about their intentions, they stated they are legit and have a verified paypal and account. 
 
This buyer wanted to ask me some question and asked to call me. I declined the call but said they could text me. 

THis person was asking will I ship to Vietnam via USPS (which is not a problem I have done this before) for their girlfriends birthday.  My only option was FEDEX international. I was reluctant but I agreed to ship Express USPS INT. It was going to cost 95 bucks with insurance. This bidder was also interested in some Beats Headphones I had listed too. 
Fast forward to the end of the auction and many texts later.

 This bidder was the high bidder on both my auctions. They informed me they would pay within 12 hours. 
Twelve hours later no payment, sent reminder after 24 hours (only because they gave the 12 hour time frame). 

Finally they paid, not through ebay, but directly through paypal.  Not only that, the total for the two items plus shipping was 1650, they paid me 1800.  I informed this buyer of all these red flags but they are insisting they are legit. 

Address is not verified so no seller protection on paypal.

I suspect that me may be using an automated system to watch for certain items and place offers based on a percentage. None the less it's a bit frustrating since it's the same guy.

Ebay,"Scared of item selling for less, any thoughts?","Hi all, I recently bought a Pentax K-30 DSLR camera for £370 from Amazon.

The item is like new, and most that I've seen with a kit lens included go for £400+ usually. What did I do wrong with my listing, and is there anything I can change to increase the final sale.

Ebay,Need help quickly; returned an item that wasn't what I bought.,"So, I bought an item from a seller in Japan. I got the item, but it wasn't what I bought.

I sent it back First Class International, and the tracking basically just said it was processed at an Origin Facility, and that it's an international letter. Doesn't say if it was sent or not, but I'm not sure if it even will. It was sent out about 36 days ago... yeah, first class sucks.

Now, I either have to get this item swapped for the right one or get it refunded. Not a problem, right? Well, the Resolution Center says I have until tomorrow to get this sorted out.

What should I do? Should I open up a case saying I got the wrong item? Should I just wait it out and trust the seller? They have 17K feedback with a 99.7% positive rating.

What would be the best option?

Ebay,A little help needed with a unauthorised payment chargeback,"Hey everyone,

I've only recently become involved with this subreddit but so far I've found it very welcoming so I'm asking for your help. I logged into PayPal this morning (I'm a UK seller on eBay with TRS status) to find a hold placed on some of my funds to the value of £75, which isn't huge I know. In the resolution centre I found I have a case to resolve with the following details:

""The buyer filed a chargeback with the card issuer, stating that this transaction was unauthorised.

Next, the card issuer will decide if the chargeback is valid. While the case is being investigated, we place a temporary hold on the funds.

If you think this chargeback is unwarranted, we can help you submit a case to the card issuer.

To respond, please click Resolve within ten days of the date the chargeback was filed.""

What are my options here, I'm not really sure what PayPal wants from me as it sounds like someone used the buyers credit card. Am I liable for that?

Any and all help would be appreciated. I'm sure I can hunt around the house for some 'rewards' to send out if people would like.

Ebay,eBay Buyer Protection Cases,"So in the past few months, I've been selling parts from macbooks that stopped working (listed as ""as-is"" and not guaranteeing the item to work) and with a motherboard, I sold it as-is, saying it was unknown if it was working or not. The guy files a case and eBay sides with him, after a bunch of explaining I finally had it closed in my favor.

This time, I sold a White Macbook, that would not boot.

""
Condition:	For parts or not working :  
Seller Notes:	“Cannot get laptop to boot, almost sure its the keyboard only since the battery charges which means the battery and the logic board should work. being sold as-is, no screws.”

Description: ""White macbook that I'm almost sure the keyboard doesn't work on. Being sold as-is. Logic board and battery should work, unsure about screen. no hdd included as I need to wipe/retrieve data off of it.""


The buyer filed a case as well, stating it was not as described, but as you can see, I did not guarantee anything to work or whatever. I stated what I THOUGHT the problem was. I can't test it as I don't have a bunch of other fully working macbooks to test the individual parts on. I escalated it to customer support to get it resolved faster but they automatically side with the buyer, as I've heard they have before with a bunch of other people.

Ebay,"Seller marks item as shipped 7 days ago, item was actually just shipped today.","So long story short I ordered some parts on ebay in order to refurbish some incomplete and/or non-working computers I got from Craig's list.  I'm donating them to a few different friends of mine with new kids or kids on the way that don't have the money for a computer.  In any event  most of the parts I ordered, like most of my transactions, were shipped immediately and I've got them already.

I ordered 2 cd-rom drives (specific to this model computer, it's an HP minitower) from a seller on Feb 26th and they were marked shipped with a tracking number and estimated delivery date of March 2nd.  Today is the first day that the tracking number is trackable online, and it shows that it just had its origin scan today, with an updated delivery estimate of March 11th.

I've contacted the seller and asked for an explanation.  What I want to ask you guys in the community here is, am I warranted in leaving negative feedback?  I feel it was fraudulent if not dishonest to mark the item as shipped a full 7 days before actually shipping it.  Is it also a violation of ebay policy to mark something as shipped when it hasn't shipped?  I also don't want to try and blackmail him and say ""refund me some % or I'll leave negative feedback.""

My friend's wife is eagerly awaiting the computer so she can set up registries, scan/post ultrasound pics and do all of the stuff you'd imagine a first time mom-to-be would do with a computer.  Now she has to wait over a week longer.  It's not the money in this case, it's the timing and the feeling like I've been wronged here so I really want to leave negative feedback.  Please tell me if you think I'm over-reacting.  A lot of you here know what you are doing and I will respect your opinions.  Thanks for reading.

*UPDATE*

In case anyone is interested in an update, here is how it all ended up.  Things started off pretty poorly, with the seller offering a quick apology but saying he had indeed dropped the item off on February 27th.  It all started to unravel when I asked to confirm that he had indeed sent it Priority Mail as was specified in the auction, and he then admitted to me that he had sent the items first class because Priority was too expensive, and he then admitted that he had in fact not dropped the item off until the day the USPS scan had showed.  I became furious but kept my composure the best I could.  I pointed out the fact that he had sold THIRTY of these drives before my auction, and was well aware of the costs to ship them, and that he still had over 20 of them up for sale on the site proclaiming Priority Mail shipping.  

The seller apologized and offered to send me 2 more drives via Fed-ex priority mail overnight, which I accepted.  I received them this morning.  As a direct result, I will be able to get the machine ready for the mom-to-be and deliver it tomorrow; that's all that mattered in this whole thing anyway, getting her the computer.  I offered to refuse/send back the package of drives that were on their way via 1st class mail but the seller refused saying he was sorry and didn't want to cause me any more trouble.  I wrote him a nice thank you letter and, ultimately, left him positive feedback.

Some of you will say I was ridiculous, silly, etc for making any sort of deal out of this and I respect that.  But he admitted to straight up lying not only to me but to dozens of other customers; he has many pages of far higher value items up for sale now.  I hope and honestly believe that this experience will challenge him to provide a higher level of service to his customers.  Some of you will say I shouldn't have left positive feedback, as if he doesn't change his ways another customer could become a victim.  Fair enough, but I think spending at least $40 and shipping out 2 free drives to right a wrong was over and above what was owed to me, and therefore deserving of the feedback rating.  I feel when leaving feedback you have to take the entire transaction, from start to finish, into account and in this case I am ultimately a happy customer.

Thanks to those of you that gave me advice, this subreddit is great.  Have a great day!

Ebay,Selling XBOX Live Subscriptions,"Hey folks, I've never sold XBOX Live Subscriptions before, and I listed 2 yesterday.

One already sold and within the day, but it was retracted by eBay because someone had apparently been bidding on that account without permission (basically hacked I think). Right when the person bought it, he asked me to send the code through a message.

Ebay,"I buy a video game and inside comes a physical card redeemable for items, contents, whatever.  Can i sell this on the US site?","It tends to be quite fuzzy. Ebay seems to be cracking down more and more because i notice there is far less sales like this going on.  Userids like Valleyofthedeer seems to have free reign and a duopoly with another guy in the UK because of the much more liberal Ebay UK rules.  Ebay UK rules state you must state that you will only deliver via post and you will not send via email   

With that said, can i list it on the UK site if i am a TRPS? If so, must i be a TRPS UK or is US good enough?

The confusion further extends because if this same item that came with a game was a Microsoft Points card, which is, by all realistic purposes, a potentially digital delivered item as well, is fully allowed and never an issue.

Ebay,I need advice in a Buyer Protection Case filed against me,"So, I sold an old digital camera on eBay a few days ago. I had it listed as a 7-day auction listing and I had a buyer approach me about ending it early. Since a bid had already been placed, I couldn't add a Buy-it-Now price. He offered to bid up so he'd be the highest bidder, then I'd end the auction and send him an invoice, adding to the shipping the remaining amount that we'd agreed on. The transaction would fall within ebay policy, so I agreed and we did it.

Fast forward to last night and I get a message from the guy saying he received the camera but he has an issue. He claims there's a dead pixel on the camera's LCD screen and he wants to be compensated for it. I sent him a lengthy response indicating that I hadn't noticed the issue, that the item was clearly listed as Used, that he had the opportunity to ask questions about the condition of the camera, and, on top of that, that dead pixels are a commonality with LCD screens, especially considering the age of this one. I provided links to several sites that said that one dead pixel is nothing to worry about. I said I wouldn't compensate him but if he was truly unhappy, I'd issue a full refund provided he paid to ship the item back to me.

I woke up this morning to a message saying a Buyer Protection case had been opened. According to the response form, I can simply send a message (this is marked as his preference but I've already done that and I'd rather not draw the situation out), Request that he return the item for a full refund (I've already offered this but I'd do it again), issue a refund without getting the item (NOPE), issue a partial refund (NOPE), or escalate to Ebay customer support to make a final decision (I can include a message stating my case)

What should I do? Given that he asked me to end the auction early, and he agreed to my price when we negotiated, I know he really wanted this camera, so I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to return it. If I offer a refund for returning the item, would he be forced to either return it or close the case?

If I escalate to Ebay Customer Support, do you think they'd rule in my favor? I seriously don't think one dead pixel falls under ""item significantly not as described"" and I've already offered him a refund.


Thanks for any advice you can give me!

**UPDATE**:  I ended up escalating to Ebay Customer support because I found, in my research, that they'd read any existing messages anyway and I figured any other action would just bring me back to the same point.  I just got a response from a representative saying that they have the case on hold while they ask the buyer to provide proof.  I don't know how I feel about that though.  I worry that if he provides a photo showing a dead pixel, they will rule in his favor...

**UPDATE 2**: So, I just got a message that they ruled in his favor and are asking him to send the camera back to me for a refund. He's apparently already submitted a tracking number. I'm very surprised that he's not appealing or asking to just close the case, since he refused my original offer of a refund.
At least I'm getting my camera back, but I'm obviously wary that it'll be damaged and I also don't want any negative marks on my selling record, so I think I should call first thing in the morning and try to appeal.

**UPDATE 3**: Woke up this morning to a message from the buyer (outside of the ebay resolution center) saying that he got the message that he can return the camera (yes, he said can, he obviously doesn't think he has to) but if I give him $10, he'll drop the case and not leave negative feedback.

So, here he is, trying to skirt the ebay system once again, and now essentially threatening me.

He's providing ample evidence that he doesn't want to return the camera, and is therefore not truly dissatisfied and really only wants $10. He's obviously been backed into a corner of ""return it or drop the case."" I decided to call ebay. I explained everything from the beginning when the buyer asked me to end the auction early and still, the representative I spoke to was unfortunately kind of a jerk and didn't seem to even think the buyer was shady at all. He all but encouraged me to just send the guy $10 to close the case. WTF. He told me that since the decision has already been made, they have to give the guy 10 days to show tracking progress on sending the item back. Until then, he can't reverse the decision. I guess it's fair enough that they should give him time to act, but I also was never given a chance to appeal after the decision was made. 

I guess I just have to wait him out now. Hopefully he wants the camera badly enough that he doesn't send it back. If he does, I can appeal after that, but I don't know if it'll be worth it unless it comes back damaged. BTW, total BS that the ""buyer has uploaded tracking information."" The representative flat-out told me ebay uploaded it. I told him they really need to change the wording then.


**UPDATE 4**: After I got off the phone with ebay, I discovered that they actually have a feedback extortion policy. I called back (got a really nice agent) and explained that I was shocked that the previous agent hadn't mentioned this policy and offered to enforce it when I mentioned what the buyer had done. The agent investigated, said there was sufficient evidence, and that the dirt-bag will be penalized, it might be with a warning or up to having his account suspended. The semi-bad news is that she said it has no bearing on the case, feedback extortion is simply handled separately. Loop-hole anyone? Shouldn't anyone who violates policy not be able to open cases against people, especially where the extortion is part of the case? I'm happy anyway.

Ebay,I need advice in a Seller Protection case that was filed against me,"So, I sold an old digital camera on eBay a few days ago. I had it listed as a 7-day auction listing and I had a buyer approach me about ending it early. Since a bid had already been placed, I couldn't add a Buy-it-Now price. He offered to bid up so he'd be the highest bidder, then I'd end the auction and send him an invoice, adding to the shipping the remaining amount that we'd agreed on. The transaction would fall within ebay policy, so I agreed and we did it.

Fast forward to last night and I get a message from the guy saying he received the camera but he has an issue. He claims there's a dead pixel on the camera's LCD screen and he wants to be compensated for it. I sent him a lengthy response indicating that I hadn't noticed the issue, that the item was clearly listed as Used, that he had the opportunity to ask questions about the condition of the camera, and, on top of that, that dead pixels are a commonality with LCD screens, especially considering the age of this one. I provided links to several sites that said that one dead pixel is nothing to worry about. I said I wouldn't compensate him but if he was truly unhappy, I'd issue a full refund provided he paid to ship the item back to me.

I woke up this morning to a message saying a Buyer Protection case had been opened. According to the response form, I can simply send a message (this is marked as his preference but I've already done that and I'd rather not draw the situation out), Request that he return the item for a full refund (I've already offered this but I'd do it again), issue a refund without getting the item (NOPE), issue a partial refund (NOPE), or escalate to Ebay customer support to make a final decision (I can include a message stating my case)

What should I do? Given that he asked me to end the auction early, and he agreed to my price when we negotiated, I know he really wanted this camera, so I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to return it. If I offer a refund for returning the item, would he be forced to either return it or close the case?

If I escalate to Ebay Customer Support, do you think they'd rule in my favor? I seriously don't think one dead pixel falls under ""item significantly not as described"" and I've already offered him a refund.

Now it doesn't and buyer threw away the shipping packacge required by USPS to make a claim","I am selling off all my Swatch watches. This particular Swatch was my prize, my favorite. And to top it off, it was in its actual original labeled box. Most at the time were just in any box due to stores slapping watches in the case and when selling just grabbed a box. It even also had any and all stickers from the retailer on it. 

Item sold and I shipped it via USPS with an official Priority Mail box, their Priority tape. I insured it, tracked it, everything. Buyer says it is not working. Says he tried a new battery. Demands a refund, my auctions state no refunds. I did offer to give them a credit for other Swatches due to this watch being special and so rare, I know there is a place that is in Europe who repairs them, or I could convert it and place this face into an automatic Swatch. Buyer says no to the credit.

I told the customer that the proper way to proceed is to go through the USPS claims, and I requested the item, packing materials and the watch. The buyer has thrown all the box and materials away. We can no longer file a claim for this because of their actions and they demand an instant refund. 

Anyone had this issue? Am I about to lose out? After seeing the rare violin being destroyed per eBay's request, I am a little worried.

Ebay,Ebay Fraud: Some ASS is trying to scam me!,"Long story short some person is trying to scam me out of an item on Ebay. They've done a very clever job of crafting fake emails from both PayPal and Ebay which are both confirming me that I should send out my item ASAP with conformations of payment being sent to my Paypal. But, to no suprise, both PayPal and Ebay have no records of this person even existing on the site.

Currently they are still trying to get me to send the item (but that's not gonna happen) and I want to figure out who this person is so that I can report him/her to the proper authorities. To give you an example of the length people will go to, here's a snip bit of one of the emails: 

&gt;I apologize for not contacting you immediately, I received an email from eBay saying the listing has been cancelled, I knew where the problem came from. It was my daughter who had to log on to my eBay account to view the purchase history, she was also happy with the purchase, but eBay had thought it was a third party due to their over zealousness, they decided to protect us both. The issues with my account has now been resolved and confirmed by eBay. I hope you have gotten a confirmation email from eBay about these being resolved

I precisely purchased the item on behalf of a folk of mine in West Africa who has been transferred to serve as a missionary in Nigeria.I will be leaving for New Zealand  for a program I'm seeking your help in getting the item posted to him in Nigeria.

Ebay,How to ship efficiently for small to medium home operations,"This is for someone who doesn't use any extra software solutions and prints labels at home.

**Pre-pack and organize your items after listing them**

I pre-pack items before they sell, and I number them.  I use ""custom label"" to store the number, and then I write the number on the package.  I don't seal the package, in case of combined items or questions.  For added confirmation, I write a one or two word description for myself on the package, like ""Yellow earrings.""  Pre-weigh items and write the weight on there, too.  

On a weekday morning, I click ""Awaiting Shipment.""  I then pull the packages based on their numbers, which I store in order.  This is easier with small items, but you can do it with any.  

I grab the first package, say number 62, while looking at the Awaiting Shipment screen.  I click the Sales Record Number.  I write the first and last name on the package (I'll put my label over it, so it doesn't have to be pretty.)  I do this with each package.

**Get started shipping**

Then I click to select all Awaiting Shipment, and I use the bulk shipping to load them all.  Then, one-by-one enter weights.  This can be a little bit of a pain because Bulk ship doesn't show custom labels.  But you can check by name, or if you wrote ""yellow earrings,"" it's easy enough.  

Once weights are entered, print labels.  Don't print instructions.  [Use self-adhesive labels](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GGPHY4/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), you'll save yourself a ton of time with them.  Use the scan form, and print it on the back of the left over sticker paper back from yesterday's adhesive labels (print on the matte side, not the glossy side.)  If you ship first class international, cut one of the adhesive pages in half so it doesn't print that worthless second half page.  

Learn how ebay orders the labels.  If you have 5 domestic, 1 international first class, and a scan form, put into your printer:  re-used label sheet (matte side), then 6 full page adhesive sheets (you'll have one half-sheet label left over, comes out blank), and one adhesive label that you cut in half.  This will perfectly account for your labels.

I print all greyscale and 'draft.'  Never had an issue, and my ink goes a long long way.

**Put the labels on**

Then, with the stack of labels and your packages around you, just start putting them on the packages by matching names.  Once every 100 packages, a name will not match, but what usually happens is you match 4 out of 5, and end up with a random left over label and one package.  Go back to eBay and look at the order details just to be sure.  When this happens its because someone has a different name on their paypal account, or are sending it as a gift.  

**More sanity**

If you take the time to pre-pack when you're watching TV at night or something, you'll be so much more comfortable and less shocked by the time drain of shipping.  Because I've got mine down to this system, I've actually hired someone to do my packing for me and I'm able to have her come once a week to do all my packing, and I'm set.

One man's experience, anyway.  I have 12 packages to ship tomorrow and I don't need more than 20 minutes to do it, so long as some integral ebay feature doesn't go down.  But that's a different story.

Carry on, fellow pickers and entrepreneurs!

I've decided to do you a favor. I'm going to tell you what you have here and allow you to cancel the sale and relist. I make my pin money by finding high end designer merchandise that sellers are oblivious about, but once in awhile I feel like a theif and just can't live with myself.

The logo is a large Roman ""H"" with the slash of a caligraphic ""j"" going through the center. You may only get $150 for them in this market but you need to familiarize yourself with this logo as he is the most famous designer producing traditional designs from Indonesia. The retail on his earrings are rareley less than $400 unless it is his ""Angela"" line. So when you relist you might want to consider an opening bid of say $150 with a buy-it-now for $200.

Being an unexperienced eBay user, I feel like this deal is too good to be true. On the other hand the seller has some good reputation. So I need an advice here. Do you think this thing is legit or not? If not, would anyone be kind enough to redirect me to another seller?

Thanks.

PS: I'd obviously go with the obvious choice and buy the gift card from Spotify's website but unfortunately I'm not in the US or in any Spotify-available countries for that matter.",6,5,2013-03-12,EBAY,0.016993148252367973,0.8928179740905762,0.09018883109092712

Ebay,Does anyone have any links to real customer support on eBay?,"I used to be with a company that sold 50k+ a month and we had a way to get good customer support.  Now I'm a pittaly bronze PS and TRS.

Ebay,I'm seriously at the end of my tether with this. Ebay customer support has not been helpful and I don't know what to do,"Right, I'll try and keep this brief.

Three weeks ago on friday I lost my phone. Saturday night I purchased a new phone from [this guy](http://feedback.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&amp;userid=quality_smart_phones&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2776). The phone was supposed to come on the tuesday but it arrived on the wednesday. Whatever, no big deal. 

I try to restore the phone from a back-up and I update the iOS. This puts the phone in set-up mode. I get to the end of the set-up and it won't get past apples activation servers, it's stuck in set-up. I then find out it's been jailbroken. Something I'm not interested in for several reasons which i won't go in to. It did say this on the listing, but the return policy said I could return it, even if I just changed my mind about the product. I contact the seller and he says it's no problem, it can be fixed. I get no response on how to fix it. I ask again, he says ''sure, just give me your email address''. I give him my email address and didn't hear anything off him. By now I've already requested a return address twice, I ask again, he ignores me. I ask again and threaten ebay action, he gives me the address. I send it immediately, recorded next day delivery at my own cost. He receives its and I open a return item case in the resolution centre. This was a week ago and I've sent two messages since and not heard anything from him. His contact phone no. is useless, it rings but goes to voicemail (i think he's screening my calls). 

I contacted ebay customer supports and they said they can't do anything about it. What the fuck ebay? They say because I don't have an open case in the resolution centre they can't do anything (I opened a case two days before the return limit was up) and that I should just keep trying to contact the seller. Which is fucking useless since he's not answering anything. All I can do apparently is report him as a seller, but ebay won't actually intervene. I don't think the woman understood me (she was foreign). What can I do? I haven't had a phone for three weeks because I can't afford to buy another one until he refunds me the money. Help? :(

edit: I should also mention that I stupidly left positive feedback as soon as I got the phone, before I realised it was jailbroken.",12,2,2013-03-12,EBAY,0.08773460984230042,0.8846940398216248,0.027571305632591248

Ebay,Problem with Ebay fees.,"I sold an item last week for about $100. 

Then Ebay calculated that I owed $10 for fees. I ended up having a problem with the buyer, and I refunded their $100 back using Paypal. They said they received the refund successfully without any problem.

But Ebay **still** says I owe them $10 for fees. But why? I refunded the money to the buyer. Why do I still owe fees?

Ebay,"eBay battle with a Seller attempting to rip me off from a refund. details provided, what are my options?","First off - Yes I have opened up a Customer Service dispute in eBay.

I bought a package of 2x4GB memory on eBay and realized when I got it that it was not compatible with my laptop. I communicated clearly with the seller, and they communicated back to me on refund/return requirements. I complied and sent it back. 

They got back to me today, claiming that I am ""frauding"" them because I removed the stickers, and reapplied them - and here's the best part: because the modules were not arranged in the package the same way they originally sent them. Yeah.... 

These people immediately took a hostile tone with me and threatened legal action on ME (!). I'll provide whatever details I can (excluding my eBay username) - but in my time on eBay (over 10 years), I've never encountered such hubris as this. 

TL;DR ebay seller trying to say i swapped out memory in a return, when i didn't trying to deny my refund. seeking advice. details below.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


**DETAILS:**

**Original return instructions from the seller:**

""Please ship it back to us a method that can be tracked. Please ship it complete just as you have received it. Once we get the memory back we will inspect and test it again. If the memory is bad we will issue you a full refund. If it is good we will process it as a standard return with restocking fees.""


**Seller reply when they received the returned item:**

""Hi, we received the Memory Back, unfortunately we will not be able to give you a refund. The memory has been blatantly tampered with, the labels on the memory that you sent us back are not in the same position as when we shipped the memory out to you and one of the labels is upside down. It looks as if the tags were pulled off of the moemory we sent you and stuck to this memory. If you would like to open a case with Ebay that is your right but we have proof of the tampering, also if needed we will prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law to protect ourselfs, our ebay store and, our feedback.""

**My reply:**

""That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. They're not in the same ""position""? Then reposition them. The stickers are not in the same place? Then put them back. I will absolutely be starting a dispute with you. Reconsider whether this is worth it.""

**Seller:**

""You have comitted Fraud by removing the tags from the memory we sent you and placing the tags on diffrent memory and then sending it back to us. Because you committed this fraud through the mail that does make it fedral and we will be prosecuting to the full extent of the law.""

**My reply:**

""No, I absolutely did not. Do you even know what you sent me? I sent back the exact same memory modules you sent me. I remove the stickers when installing them in my laptop because I don't want them to come off from wear and tear and get lost in internal components. 

It really sounds to me like you people have no clue what you're even talking about or what you're selling. How about you take a look at the printed information on the actual modules of memory and confirm that they match up with the package information? 

I'm sure you won't though, because by now you've probably swapped them out yourself in order to accuse ME of fraud over a measly $48. You're taking advantage of the situation AND the customer since you have the evidence on your end. Absolutely ridiculous.""

**Seller reply:**

""We will not do anything unethical or illegal. I will have a tech inspect the memory modules more closely and run diagnostics, etc. We will verify the truth of things and get get back to you. The memory modules have absolutely been tampered with and the labels have been peeled off. I will send pictures, etc. shortly. ""

""We will not take advantage of anyone, but we will not be taken advantage of either.""

**My reply:**

""Well regardless of whatever you are saying, it is perfectly clear to me you are trying to take advantage of the details to justify your position - especially since you have the evidence in your possession. You're making yourselves look bad. Think about it. ""

**Seller reply:**

""Sir, we are not the once that comitted the fraud. We have pictures of the memory before we sent it out to you and recorded history of the serial numbers before we shipped them out to you and the condtion of the memory before shipped.""

**My reply:**

""Then let's see these photos. I can't wait to see.""

**Seller reply:**

""several of them are on the listing where you purchased the memory from in the first place.""

**My reply:**

""No. I am referring to a photo of what you have in your hands at this very moment. I want you to prove that what you are holding, or whoever it is, is not in fact what I sent back - which is exactly the same thing that I was sent in the first place.""

**NEW:** 
**Seller Reply:**

""""Customer comitted fraud by removing the labels from the memory we sent him and putting it on other memory and sending it back to us via USPS Mail. We will be filing a Police report so that they can contact the customer in his area. If the customer wants to return the acctual units that we shipped out to him we can issue a refund but since the customer is trying to commit fraud against us we are unable to process a refund at this time.""

--------------------------------------------
Claim followed and paypal watched like a hawk, money does not arrive as seller has Insufficent balance to make said transaction
--------------------------------------------

Hello xxxxxxx,

Thank you for contacting eBay Customer Service about the accessories (281048390091) that you purchased from ""xxxxxxxxx"". I understand that you still have not received your refund, please allow me to explain our next logical step.

xxxxx, I have reviewed your case and I can see that this case was closed on February 22,2013 as your seller issued you a full refund.

However, after further review I have found that the PayPal refund issued by your seller has not completed successfully. As this case has already been closed due to the refund being issued we will no longer be able to process your refund via the Resolution Centre and will have to credit your PayPal account separately.

I have submitted a request to have your PayPal account credited with the amount of £106.00 GBP. Payments processed in this manner generally take up to 10 days or until March 6, 2013 and we would appreciate your patience whilst we resolve this for you.

I trust I've explained this clearly. If I can be of any further help, simply reply to this email.

Please note, you may receive your refund between March 1 up to March 10, 2013. This is a manual payment that is why it takes time to reflect on your PayPal account. Rest assured that your refund will reflect on your PayPal account, I suggest that you check your PayPal account from time to time to verify the refund.

We appreciate your patience regarding this matter I trust this information is helpful and I wish you all the best on eBay in the future.

Hello xxxxxx,

Thank you for writing back eBay Customer Service regarding the console (item 281048390091) that you bought. I understand that you are concerned about your refund. I'm sorry to hear that you have not received it yet. I'm willing to assist you with this.

We sincerely apologise for the delay in getting your refund.

Upon further review, I can see that my colleague already submitted a request with regards to your refund. As far as I can see, it has been approved, however, it will take longer to process as our higher management will issue it manually.

Issues like this occurs when we process a refund in seller's behalf by deciding on the case you filed, however, the refund didn't went through because there is a possibility that seller's PayPal account has insufficient balance. Therefore, we need to escalate the issue to our higher management in order for them to process your refund. Please be advised that the refund will come from our own pocket not on the seller's account.

-------------------------------------------------
Really as this was the issue back on 23rd February when i initialised this whole conversation -_- well what will you say next?

xxxxxxxxx, I understand your frustration regarding this issue, I’ve investigated your details and can see that my colleague requested your payment to be processed on 28th of February 2013 however due to some technical issue, the payment did not complete to your PayPal account.

We apologise sincerely for the delay in this refund reaching your account and I can assure you I’ve now taken necessary action to ensure this payment will be processed to your PayPal account. Please note, as always these manual payments can take between 3-10 days to process but at this time it may take longer than expected due to some technical issue we are have .

Ebay,Buyer did not read item description and wants a refund...,"All,

Thanks for taking the time to help out with this.

I have been selling off my collection of Magic: The Gathering cards over the last few weeks.

One of my listings was for a playset (4) of a certain card.  One of the  4 cards was a foil, which usually sells for about 4X the price of the standard cards.

The title of my listing..

4x Bloodbraid Elf Alara Reborn NM FOIL mtg

In my description, the first and second sentence, I clearly explain that the listing is for 4 cards, 1 of them a foil.

A buyer purchased them via BIN, and I shipped the cards out.  He messaged me explaining that the title was misleading and the cards were not as described.  He was expecting 4 foil cards.

In a second message (all through ebay) he admits that he purchased them based on the title alone through the mobile app.

I can see where there might be some confusion based on the title, but the intent was not to deceive, simply to make sure foil was in the title since one card was a foil.  It never even occurred to me that people might not read the description before purchasing.

The listing was marked as not accepting returns.

Has anyone had this happen in the past?  Did Ebay side with the buyer or the seller?  Does it matter that the buyer admitted to not reading the description at all?

UPDATE:  The buyer is now claiming that the value of the cards has gone down and he wants a full refund.  I have offered to refund all but the value of the FOIL (the regular ones are worth enough to care) and he is still disagreeing.  Does this sound like a legitimate buyers remorse situation to anyone else?

UPDATE:  I have not heard from the buyer on this matter now for almost a week.  My last message to the buyer was an offer to refund $2 (the item was only $6 to begin with) so they didn't have to bother shipping anything back.  I have had no reply from them.  

What kind of time frame would you all consider reasonable for this to drag out?",18,9,2013-03-13,EBAY,0.040334634482860565,0.9278797507286072,0.031785592436790466

Ebay,My biggest sale ended in a return...,"Did I do the right thing?

I recently sold 3 faucets for $189.99 a piece, totaling $569.97. I offered *free shipping priority mail* and managed to get them to the buyer in 2 days. That cost me $43 after insurance. Upon arrival, the buyer was *disappointed* because the faucets did not include the valve. I clearly stated that the valve was not included, and I included multiple pictures of the items as well as stated in the description what you see if what you will get. He contacted me wanting to return them because ""they were useless to him as they are"" and I do offer a 14 day return policy; however, in my return policy I clearly state that I do not accept returns because the buyer bought the wrong item (technically he didn't buy the wrong item but thought it came with something it didn't), but I will accept returns if the item is damaged upon arrival and the buyer can prove that it is - they are not damaged.

The buyer and I went back and forth for about 2 hours until we finally came to the conclusion that I will accept the return if the buyer pays the $43 it cost me to ship it as well as a 10% restocking fee (I had already paid the eBay fee's - whoops) of $57. He told me that he is a senior citizen on a fixed income, he may be lying he may not be - I'll never know. I refunded him $470 BEFORE receiving the items in the mail, this is totally against my policy, but he said he needed money to ship the items back to me, and I guess I was just in that kind of mood... I did make $10 off this entire thing and am receiving the 3 faucets back.

He shipped the items back to me priority mail, I'm currently waiting for them and they should be here within 48 hours, he told me the post office told him Wednesday the 13th. 

Reddit, did I do the right thing? Or should I have just told him to bad and just taken potential negative feedback and a possible case opened against me?

Ebay,"I just sold my item, buyer paid, and now buyer wants to cancel. Pretty mad, can I say NO?","I just sold an exclusive item for a good price ($200) and the buyer paid immediately and sent me a message saying thank you. Now three hours later the buyer says ""plz plz plz can you cancel this item. i am sorry but i bought it as a gift and i do not need it anymore, my friend bought it himself!""

Now usually I would sigh and go ahead and cancel, but the item I sold has already gone down in value on ebay. I was one of the first to sell it this morning so I got a higher price. Now I can only get $180 or so for it. 

My auction did state NO RETURNS ACCEPTED. An eBay auction is a binding agreement and I think it's BS that a buyer can just ""change their mind"". The buyer decided he wanted the item so he has to be responsible for that. Especially since he already sent me the money, which is why I feel I have the upper hand right now.

Basically, can I say ""no"" to the buyer that I will not cancel and that I am going to ship him the item he paid for? I will explain to him that a winning auction and paying for it on eBay means he decided he wanted it and has to go through with his actions. I will say this in a professional manner of course. I really don't care if the buyer is upset or whines. I'm hoping if I send this message he will say ""Ok I understand"" but I'm expecting the worse.

Would the buyer be able to do something with PayPal that would get me screwed in anyway from this? The only bad thing I see happening is that the buyer disputes and gets his money back, which is what would happen anyways if I agreed to refund him right? 

I just want to sell my item to this person for the good amount I got for it. This person decided to buy it so he has to man up and accept that. He shouldn't have bid in the first place and should not have paid so quickly if he had second thoughts. I realize that the buyer actually is probably telling the truth with not needing the item anymore because its a gift, but frankly that's not my problem right?

Ebay,How screwed am I? Delivered package from seller stolen from my mail.,"So I ordered a $190 item on eBay.

The tracking information says it was delivered at 12:30PM today, when I wasn't around. When I did finally check my mail at 9PM: Nothing there. 

Since my landlord lives upstairs at the same address and our mail is frequently mismatched, I ask him if he received my package. He tells me that at 3PM, he found my package in his mail, and then put it into my mail bin. My mail bin is not very large, but he says the package was about 3"" by 7"" and fit with the mail door closed. 

However, when I got to checking my mail, the mail door was open and the package absent, so I am led to believe that some jerk stole my mail. 

So, judging from past experiences, as a buyer, how screwed am I? I know for a fact that the package is not stuck in the postal system but in the dirty hands of a thief. All tracking information indicates that the package was successfully delivered. There was no signature verification.

What's the best way to proceed as a buyer? Is there any history of eBay/PayPal taking the side of the buyer in this case? Should I get a chargeback from my CC company? Or am I really going to throw away 190 dollars?

Ebay,I am a 10 year eBay member who is closing my account due to eBay's poor Feedback management.,"I have been an eBay member for 10 years, and I've participated in thousands of transactions.  Until a couple of weeks ago, I had a perfect feedback score.  I had the unfortunate experience of selling to a scammer who attempted to recoup the transaction value by filing a Buyer Protection case; I won the Buyer Protection case, and the buyer vindictively left me negative feedback, destroying the reputation I've spent 10 years building.


I appealed this electronically (through eBay's new 'report this buyer' feature) and received no follow up.  Today, I called eBay and spoke with two customer service representatives about this piece of feedback.  Apparently, eBay's current position is that feedback is 'an opinion' - despite the fact that any active user of the site realizes that it is a strong indicator to buyers, and is not viewed in the nuanced manner that eBay customer service claims.


I spoke with a feedback specialist (Zack) and with a manager (Lindsay).  Neither of them had the authority to remove feedback unless it violated eBay's policies, and Lindsay claimed that 'no one' at eBay could delete a piece of feedback unless it violated said policies.  As an aside, I find it immensely frustrating to contact any company that employs customer service representative who do not have the ability to intervene on a customer's behalf.  Why bother hiring a customer service manager (Lindsay's position) if that manager won't have any autonomy?  But I digress...


Despite being a 10 year member of the site, and receiving hundreds of positive feedback ratings, eBay's customer service team would not intervene on my behalf, and I'm closing my account after this weekend (my fees for this sale are in the midst of being processed, and I want to wait until that is complete to avoid any credit issues down the line).


I can't help but notice eBay's stock is down about 10% this month.  I wonder if it's because other long-time, small sellers like me are resigning due to eBay's unfriendly policies and lack of quality customer service, not to mention the increased proliferation of fake/misrepresented products on the site.

Ebay,Fast Listing for Unique Listings? Turbolister?,"I recently started another ebay business.

New ebay business : I have to create about 20~ unique listings each day for singular items. I've used turbolister and found the problem with this is that I first must upload photos to an online storage website like imgur and then paste the links in rather than being to upload them straight from PC.

So basically, where is the best place to store photos online easily with sub folders?

Ebay,New ebay case opening/resolution/etc (for UK at least) is awful,"I don't know why this has been changed, there has been lots of pretending lately about protecting sellers but all that has been given is the report a buyer button which is most likely useless, we have no way of judging its effect.

Anyway ebay has been changed and some of you may not have realised it because it hasn't affected you yet.

The change basically is this, if you want to contact a seller about an item not being as described = auto opens a case
If you want to contact a seller because an item has not yet arrived = auto opens a case

This is obviously a ridiculous idea and just removes buyer/seller communication. I havn't had any cases opened up on me yet but I know other people this has happened to. It doesn't even tell the buyer they are opening a case.

Here is an example.

Buyer buys an ipod
Ipod has slight fault
Buyer wants to contact seller about item not as described
Buyer goes through the usual contact seller steps
Buyer is bought to case details page and cannot contact the seller with item not as described without doing this.
Case is now opened without fully letting the buyer knowing what they are doing.

Ebay,"New guy here, small problem looking for advice.","Hey guys, this past week I recently started using ebay. I had made an account back in 2005, but never did much more than browse but never bought. I got my taxes back this week and decided to link my paypal to the account. I purchased 4 items over the course of a few days. Tonight I realized that my Ebay profile has my OLD address. (It has since been fixed) My paypal however has my current address and it is confirmed. I know its my fault for not thinking to check it before hand. In any case, I messaged all 4 sellers 2 of them have responded saying they used my paypal address. I read on Ebay's FAQ that sellers can use either address. My question is, do most sellers usually use the Paypal address? And if by chance the other 2 sellers, who have already shipped, used my old one, what is my worst case scenario? Thanks for taking a look! 

UPDATE: The rest of the sellers got back to me and all had confirmed that they used my PayPal address. So all is well. Thanks for all the advice guys!",4,1,2013-03-18,EBAY,0.04445071145892143,0.9141759276390076,0.04137343168258667
Ebay,Ebay is raising their final value fees again.  WTF,"Just got an e-mail from Ebay.  I imagine many sellers did or will eventually.  In it, Ebay is raising their final value fees from 9% to 10%.  They try and wrap it up in a balanced approach by giving the first 50 listing per month, either Auction style or fixed price, for free, and making the final value fee flat rate for both auction styles.

There are some benefits to what they are changing, but their fees seem to go up year for year, and at this point, along with PayPal fees, we are paying Ebay 13% or more of the value of an item we sell.  I pasted that part of the email below.

Am I the only one that thinks that is nuts?

New: List up to 50 FREE* every month—Auction-style or fixed price.

*Starting April 16, your 50 free listings* per month can be Auction-style or fixed price. You pay a final value fee only when your item sells.

Ebay,"""Selling my entire life"" advice request","Greetings eBayers, I come humbly seeking your advice. Bitcoin tips for useful and timely assistance (while supplies last)

I just woke up this afternoon and realized that I am surrounded by years of meticulously gathered, randomly organized, absolutely non-self-fulfilling junk. It hasn't made me any happier, and maintaining it has caused me more aggravations than I could count. 

I would estimate about 15 or so large totes ranging from 20 to 200lbs with items traversing the entire spectrum of value from the not especially valuable, to the moderately interesting.

I have no illusion that I am going to get any way near market value for all of this stuff, and frankly I don't have the time or patience to sort most of it. 

A few valuable items such as some IBM Model M keyboards, MIB lego sets and a few anime collectibles I am going to list separately, not because I assign them any special value, but because I know collectors would prefer to be able to bid on them alone without having to accept 20lbs of DDR memory, power transformers, and matchbox cars along with them. 

Unless you guys give me a compelling reason to do otherwise, I will be listing each of the separate totes, and each of the discrete items as .99cents to start, no reserve. 

I have to be honest, I haven't had much luck in eBay in the past as a seller, and I don't think I will have any interest to continue collecting or selling in the future. 

I really just want to be done with all of this, and I cannot bear the idea that I would just dump all of this stuff into a landfill somewhere if it can be of use to someone. And before you suggest donating to charity, I have already begun that route and that is where all of my clothing and furniture will be going, along with some sentimental things that I feel no one in their right mind would spend money on. 

I'm not planning to write a book, I'm probably not going to start some cross-country life changing journey cut free from the binding chains of materialism (unless I make a whole lot more than I anticipate). I just feel the amazingly overpowering need to drastically simplify my life. 

I would really appreciate advice on shipping plastic rubbermaid totes in weights between 20 and 200lbs, how I should list them (is there a 'junk life' category? I don't think 'junk drawer' covers it). Additionally, I don't really have the funds to advertise this, could any of you give me suggestions on how I can get the word out? Thank you for your time and advice.",9,2,2013-03-19,EBAY,0.04465191811323166,0.9258253574371338,0.029522737488150597

Secondly, I just had an idea and I'm not sure if we can/are allowed to do this.

Is there a way we can, as a community, formulate a pretty complete list? (ALSO, is there a limit to the amount of buyers we can block?) 

I've seen some websites that catalogue bad buyers/bidders but you really have to search their name before knowing if they are on the list but nothing as good as a complete long list of bad buyers. I'm pretty sure every seller has experienced a bad buyer once or twice in their ""career""...

Ebay,Worst type of buyer? I decided to step up and show him the door. Can I do this?,"Buyer won a SSD drive (small capacity but worth about $30-$40) for $5 with free shipping. He requested that I send the drive using Canada Post expedited service - faster delivery across the country - and asked for a quote. I told him that it would cost $10 and he accepted.

At the post office I realized that shipping costs about $13.50. I accepted the charges and took responsibility and hoped that the buyer would recognize the great service and *maybe* leave a positive feedback. I sent him the tracking number and we waited.

A few days have gone by and he sent me a message:

Dear seller,

Please start proceedings with Canada Post to refund you the shipping cost.  Expedited Service from Province1 to Province2 is already late at 9 days.  Once you receive your refund, please refund the $10 Shipping I paid you for Expedited Service.  Thank you.

- buyer


I responded, not knowing at the time that Expedited did not guarantee shipping times...


Dear buyer,

I just sent a ticket for this. I hope they won't get too technical and exclude weekends in their ""guaranteed"" days policy.

- seller

Dear seller,

Thank you for your help on this.

- buyer


It took about 8 days to get it delivered (remember, it's across Canada) and Canada Post responded to my ticket that same day he received the drive... They said something along the lines of ""The package has been received"" and it seemed that they ignored my refund question (the one the buyer confidently asked me to do for him). 


Dear seller,

I received the mSATA drive only today.  That's 8 days after you shipped it, and 6 days if one excludes the weekend. That is well beyond the standard for expedited shipping from Province1 to Province2.  Have you had any response from Canada Post?
The drive arrived in good working order - thank you.

- buyer


Dear buyer,

Canada Post sent back an email saying the package has arrived today but didn't respond to the question about the refund. I will try to contact them again.

- seller


Then shit hit the fan....


Dear seller,

The refund to you from Canada Post is actually not my business - it's yours.
Could you please refund the $10 I paid you for EXPEDITED shipping back to my PayPal account right away - no more delays. Thank you.  


- buyer


Dear buyer,

It's unfortunate that you're uneducated about this. How can I blindly refund you money that Canada Post won't give me? Also, why are you so disrespectful? After speaking with a Canada Post agent, I realize that you are unaware that there is no delivery guarantee with Expedited shipping. I was nice enough to pay $13.50 for shipping (with the insurance) and only charge you $10. You also won the SSD drive for about $5.

Let's do the math here:
You won the SSD drive for around $5 with FREE SHIPPING

$15 is the money you sent me because you asked for Expedited delivery 

- $3.50 (the extra money I paid for shipping)

- $10 (the money you paid for shipping)

- $0.50 (ebay fees)

Ebay,"Advice please?  Could be a scam, not sure.","So I am a fairly long time user of ebay; selling and buying.

I have my old PS3 slim for sale.  It has been set to auction and buy it now.  Marked as local pick up only; I don't really have much time go to a post office.

So somebody from Canada (I'm in Australia) has bought it via a Buy it Now, and left a message that they want it shipped express to Canada, and they are offering double the price and that they will transfer it via bank deposit.


So it rings the ""scam"" alarm bell for me.  But I'mnot really sure how its a scam, it just seems odd.  The buyer has only 4 transactions to his/her name 2 years ago, all positive. (edit- the buying account had been scammed)

What do you think?


Thanks for answers - ie.  Probable scam

I never contacted the seller for a refund and left average-to negative feedback in the 'item as described' (the pictures were intentionally fuzzy and the item positioned so a defect wouldn't appear as big as it really was). Would you rather get average feedback or an email asking for a refund? 

I've also often gotten 99p things with a 4.99 shipping fee. I don't really care for when exactly I get the item. Would you choose another type of shipping (cheaper) if your buyer asked?

No response. I sent another message on Monday asking them if they'd like to start the refund process to correct the address (01:39pm).

No response. I didn't want eBay thinking that I'm a lazy seller who doesn't want to ship an item, so, on Tuesday I began the refund process (06:02pm) and cancellation process on eBay (06:16pm).

The buyer denied my cancellation request today (11:34am). They put the 'new' address in their notes.

Ebay,"As a seller, strange problem with someone returning an item.","Okay, this is a strange story. 

Someone bought a Long Champ Les Pliage tote from me in early December. They said they were very happy with it when they received it. Fast forward to sometime in early January. They say they gave it to their mother and she said it was fake and they no longer want it and they want to return it. Okay- whatever. Even though I bought the bag myself and have the receipts, I know I won't win against Buyer Protection, so I accept the return. I ask them to provide a tracking number on the return and to send it back ASAP. 

I never hear from them again. My lease is up in early Feb and my partner and I are going on vacation and taking some time to travel since he just finished his PhD. So we leave. 

eBay member never contacts me again (it's been a month, I assumed he decided to keep the bag, keep in mind he purchased it on December 2nd and now we're into early Feb).

Suddenly, late Feb comes around and he asks if I got the bag. I said no, that I had moved out of my home and was taking a few months to travel. Honestly I don't have a current address. I didn't feel the need to inform him of this since generally people don't take returns after three months. You can only file claims for 45 days anyway (to the best of my knowledge). He asks for a current address, I repeat that I don't have one. I told him that whoever was living in the house now does not know me and I was sure they probably just returned it to the sender. Today, he finally (three weeks later) sends me the tracking info which says it was delivered. Does USPS show tracking when an item is being returned to sender?

Purchased one of these a few weeks ago, had it for 4 days, working fine, and all of a sudden it would not work at all, or even get detected by the computer. Contacted Razer, they told me it may be a hardware defect, told me some troubleshooting methods, in which all have failed. Filled out a form that razer supplied me with, including model number, type and seller. They then tell me that the warrenty is invalid because this ebay seller is not authorized to sell the item, and i will need to contact the seller. So i contacted the seller on the 22nd through ebay message, am still waiting for a response. I contact ebay and they show me a way to obtain the sellers phone number. I call the seller, but noone answers. I then find a website for the seller, so i have contacted that a few hours ago, again with no response. I am getting quite paranoid that i have got scammed.

Ebay,How Can I Protect Myself in This Seller (me) Situation,"I sold a mint condition, safely packaged computer video card to a guy on eBay early this month. He received the video card on the 11th of March. On March 19th he said the video card doesn't work and he wants his money back. This is a $180.00 auction.

So I immediately got concerned that the guy has done something with the card that might have broken it, since they are somewhat fragile if not handled properly. 

I offered advice to try the video card in another computer, but didn't get a response in this regard. It's also possible that he just doesn't know what he's doing. Anyways, he ended up filing a claim saying it was ""not as described"" and wants a refund. My auction stated ""no returns"". 

My concern, knowing full well that eBay Buyer Protection 99.9% of the time is going to go in the buyer's favor, is that they're going to reward him the refund, and I may or may not get the card back. On top of that, if I even get the card back, it's possible that it's now broken and unusable so I can't resell it and I'm out $180.00

How would I be protected in a situation like this? How can I prove to eBay's resolution center that the card was functional when I sold and shipped it? 

I hate to be a negative nancy but I can already tell that this is going to be in his favor and I'm going to be out of my money with a card that he most likely broke, so I'm trying to figure out how would someone protect themselves from a return like this.

In the future, I'm going to be putting insurance on EVERYTHING I ship. That's one lesson learned from this at least. 

Any other advice or guidance would be appreciated.

So some of you have guessed it; buyer left a negative feedback and eBay refuses to remove it.

When it's a matter of principle, I always stand my ground. Rather than keeping my head down and letting certain buyers bully me for a refund, I did what I thought was right. Some of you have said that he did nothing wrong in terms of policy violations while others supported my actions because sellers keep getting abused by those types of buyers with no protection from eBay.

It took me some time and calculation to come to this: I decided to close my eBay account.

Now my main source of income comes from elsewhere so this was not an extremely hard and bad decision. If more people stand up to eBay's unfair policies, I can imagine them giving sellers more power. I honestly expected more help from eBay, especially when their fees are ridiculously high.

http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=221204254783&amp;ssPageName=ADME:X:AAQ:US:1123#rpdId


I honestly didn't test it because it looked to be in great condition and between my 2 ebay accounts, I sell hundreds of electronics and hardly have any issues with electronics not working. I photographed it, wrapped it in a styrafoam shipping container filled with packaging peanuts and sent it on it's way.


he sends me this message:


Hi Roy.

Your grinder was delivered today.  Thanks for selling it to me, but I have some bad news to deliver you:

It is not working.  The blade is frozen and will not move.  The motor does make a noise that indicates it's getting power and the brushes are trying to move the motor, but it does not go.

So, contrary to your listing, I cannot use this for my needs (to grind coffee). I will be returning it to you -- and I will not be paying for the postage. I am not required to pay to return a broken and misrepresented item to you.

BTW, your misrepresentation is double, in that you only showed the crack in the top --but the lighting didn't show the scrapes on the top of the unit,  I don't really care about that though because I have another top (from my old KSM-1), but if the motor doesn't turn then forget it.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.  I am not responsible for paying to return defective items -- so you'll have to pick that cost up.

Please let me know how you'd like to handle that.
Peter Newman

FYI, both the USPS and UPS say you need at least 2"" of padding between an object and the box walls -- and packaging peanuts does not pad, but rather passes on any bump to the object inside.

They both recommend bubble wrap -- and even more padding (3"") for fragile items.

I'm really sorry it arrived broken:  I've been following KSM-1 auctions for some time, looking for one that isn't colored (they cost a lot more) and that would grind my coffee.

Yours looked like the right one, but since it's not working, no.
I feel bad for you in this -- but I sure don't want to pay $27 (or shipping back) for this ""boat anchor"" (door stop?).

Now normally i'd refund the guy back, and POOF be done with it. but the guy was so anal about me not photographing MINOR scrapes, and then he critiszing my packaging and trys to tell me packaging peanuts are not good for packaging? I've sent 20lb glass vases, tiffany lamps, stained glass windows, hundreds of ceramics, and he is going to say I didn't do a good job packaging something in a styrafoam cooler, filled beyond belief with packaging peanuts.


I'd normally just refund the guy, but him being so anal about little issues, and trying to tell me ups/usps/fedex requires bubblewrap as opposed to packaging peanuts throws up some redflags for me. I'm starting to think he wants to find grounds for me to send him money,  refund him the cash prior to him sending me the item, and then he keeps the item.


I hate having people ship me a broken product because its a waste of money, but I'm not sure if i really trust this guy.  i know it's unfair for him to have to pay shipping for something that was broken, but I really don't know if this is just a clever scam, or a sincere anal buyer.

Ebay,Seller issued a refund without notice. Paypal voucher lost?,"Hello

 I am new to ebay. I never used it before but I got a 15$ voucher from paypal and I decided I'll use it to buy a computer game that I otherwise could not afford.
 Everything went smoothly when I paid, the voucher reduced the price and I happily waited for my purchase to be delivered, but the next morning I got an email that the seller issued a refund without any notification. I got the money refunded and the voucher was refunded to paypal as it should be. The way I understand it is that the voucher now can not be used again. Can I do anything about it or should I just call it a loss?

Thank you for any information.",6,2,2013-03-29,EBAY,0.07122205197811127,0.8960307240486145,0.032747261226177216
Ebay,"Presale: buyer unwilling to pay because that's not ""standard""","I recently sold an item that isn't out yet, following Ebay's presale policy to the letter. Two days after the auction ended, I sent the buyer an invoice with a note basically saying ""Hey, it's a presale but you still have to pay me.""

Didn't hear anything back so two days after that, the 96 hours were up and I opened an unpaid item case. He was PISSED, demanded to know why I'd done that. According to him,
&gt;standard pre-orders on here (ebay) are usually payment due Friday before pre-release, lets cancel the order on a missed communication.

Ebay,I have a buyer that wants to meet up to get his item instead of me shipping it to him. Has this happened to any of you? Is this a good idea?,Update: Turns out he was trying to scam me.

Ebay,am i getting the runaround/getting scammed?,"I bought a bunch of coins on ebay. Had it shipped to my PO box. When I picked it up, the envelope was a little ragged but wasn't immediately apparent that it had been ripped open...When I opened it I found the envelope was completely empty! I contacted the seller and asked him how to proceed. He said it was my responsibility to file an insurance claim with the USPS (he purchased insurance when sending it). I showed the envelope to the post office workers asking how to file a claim. They were pretty unhelpful and said there was nothing they could do and it was the sender's responsibility fo file an insurance claim. 

The possibilities as I see it are:

A) someone opened the envelope in transit and stole the stuff and the postal workers are just being unhelpful. It really is my responsibility to file the claim and I will have to pin down the post office to get them to help.

B) the seller fraudulantly shipped me an empty envelope on purpose, collected my payment and is giving me the runaround about the insurance. 

Can anybody give me some advice on how to deal with this? If this doesn't work out I will just call my credit card to have them reverse the charge, but I have never tried that before and I'm not sure what kind of fight they will put up about that. Does eBay purchase protection offer any help in this situation?

Ebay,How to recover funds once item has been delivered,"So first of all, I was foolish.

I sold my Microsoft Surface about a week ago today and the buyer has yet to pay me or even respond to any messages I have sent via ebay and email. No payment has been received and I opened a case 2 days ago.

To my knowledge, Ebay provides no type of refunds in this sort of scenario. Is there any legal action I can take in a case like this when all I really know about the buyer is their name &amp; address? I'm in a sticky situation here. I wouldn't have been worried about it if it was a small price with a little item but given that it was greater than $400 we're talking about-I'm a little worried.

Any advice? Thank you!",14,2,2013-03-31,EBAY,0.042345620691776276,0.9145171642303467,0.04313717409968376
